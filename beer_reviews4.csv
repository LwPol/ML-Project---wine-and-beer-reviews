Ales of Kent Defiance!;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ales of Kent Brewery;Defiance! is the most recent offering from one of Kent's most recent microbreweries. An extremely pleasant, softly but interestingly hopped pale ale with a good fruity body. A very satisfying and refreshing drink, full of flavour, but gentle and well rounded. The bottle has a Latin motto: 'Scienta giducia plena provocone' which roughly translates as - The wise have the confidence to challenge! Footnote: The brewery has now closed.
Four Alls Smugglers Glory;Richmond, Durham, England;Porter;Four Alls;Cask conditioned - no sparkler. Black beer with an off white head (I would have thought this a porter rather than Brown Ale!). There are hints of chocolate in the aroma and hints of chocolate in the taste as well as some maltiness. Quite tasty and drinkable.

Badger IPA;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Old notes from way back when. Before 2003 certainly. Don’t usually enter pre-RateBeer notes but, since this is retired and I won’t get it again, what the heck. Cask (handpump), tight sparkler. A soft, thin, amber-coloured session bitter of little distinction. Too bland to find glaring faults. Probably dumped in favour of the similar strength King & Barnes Bitter so that Badger could say they hadn’t axed K & B beers altogether. No great loss.
Badger IPA;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask Handpump at the Pig & Porcupine, Manchester 31/08/2002 Amber golden coloured slightly pale and fruity. Acidic taste. Hop finish.
Badger IPA;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);This beer doesn't seem to react well to bad handling, I have had very good pints, but also very poor ones. The rating is for the better pints, but only give it a try if you trust the Landlord.
Badger IPA;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);"Hoppy aroma, bit fruity. The beer looks like applejuice. No head. And it's not just the looks; I was amazed I actually tasted apples in the beer, furthermore hoppy and bitter taste. palate is moderate bitter. Not impressive."
Badger IPA;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Clear orange color, hardly any foam. Hoppy aroma. Light hoppy and bitter taste. Not a drain pour, but i would not order it again.
Badger IPA;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Original Rating 4th May 2002 - Had this on draught in a Badger pub. Very out of condition.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Mid brown, thin head and limited aroma. Traditional English bitter, without being bitter enough for my taste.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask @ St Stephen’s Tavern, Westminster London. As Badger Best. Golden with a thin head. Mildly sticky-sweet texture, not a ’best’ bitter, but drinkable.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Had this twice, first in Salisbury at The New Inn then later in Chipping Campden. Mild and a bit thin noticeable hops. Best thing was I got a glass.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);A bit watery and not packed with flavour, prefer the tanglefoot, but this is a standard brown bitter. Slightly boring.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask at St Stevens Tavern, Westminster. Copper coloured bitter, main character a slightly spicy fruitiness, medium finish. A good example of west country bitter i guess, but have to say it isn’t my favourite part of the country for local beer.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Unassuming mid-brown ale in which neither malt nor hops dominate. Head retention is generally close to zero - not a problem if you like it that way. Just isn’t a beer I can get excited about.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);On cask. Another Badger beer and this one seems quite strange. What can I say the lack of sugar is rather noticeable I mean why have such a sour tasting beer as this. At 4% abv your not gonna get drunk on it that easy but its far from exciting this ale to be honest i’d rather drink some lemonade.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask conditioned at the Ship & Shovell, Charing Cross. Amber coloured with next to no head. Aroma had a touch of caramel and a hint of grassy hops. Flavour was slightly sweet before a decent enough bitter finish. Ok, but not memorable.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask (Tasted in London) Amber clear colour with a little head. Light aroma of floral and caramel. Light flavour of caramel and flower notes, nothing special at all, very common cask.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask, handpump @ the conveniently named King’s Arms Inn, Mickleton. Bright and still in the glass and a tawny copper in colour. Head was there then it wasn’t, but I can’t say it was the gravity of the brew (unclean pint glass!?!). Burnt caramel and burnt toast aroma that was sharp and a little unpleasant. Rather dull in the mouth with a flat, filling but lifeless body in desperate need of flavour. Bitter, burnt caramel and toffee shines through with a flavour I can only best describe as burnt, soggy newspapers. Finish is tannic and claps out with nothing showing in the aftertaste. This was as boring as hell and any characteristics it showed just did not work. A wishy-washy bitter!!!
Badger Tanglefoot (Bottle/Can);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Aroma of fruits, malt and a hint of hay. Golden with a white head. Medium + sweet and medium bitter. Medium + body with average to soft carbonation. Slightly dry and bitter finish. Overall a decent Strong Bitter.
Badger Tanglefoot (Bottle/Can);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Yes, can. Unlike the cask that I tried 4 years ago which I remember extremely well. (Actually I have no idea). This pours with a bleach white foam and medium gold body, with nothing but rotting grain on the nose. The flavour is soft Hallowe'en candies, those chewy caramel types, and a fair bit of tin thrown in. Cloying sugariness. Wow, just.... I can't even, as the reddit incel moderators say. Just a pile of caramelly junk.
Badger Tanglefoot (Bottle/Can);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);0,5l bottle @ Vihreä Haltiatar. Pours clear golden with a medium head. Aroma is sweet malts. Flavor is sweet malts with some hops. Decent.
Badger Tanglefoot (Bottle/Can);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Bottle from Waitrose. #4 MJ 500 beer of this 2019 summer trip. Medium gold with a tall, fine head. Nose is lightly citrus hops, bit of bread, touch of cardboard and pear. Lightly spicy hops. Rather plain. Falvor is lemony, almost a touch of candy in there, tart from the hops. Some white bread and sweetness. interesting hops. Prickly, lightly bitter finish. Rather fizzy, lager-like. Ok but certainly not all that profound. This was probably one of the first wave of UK golden ales that went for the lager market, but it has been surpassed abundantly by this time. Not up there with Summer Lightning even, I would say. Still drinkable but would not be in anyone's 500 today.
Badger Tanglefoot (Bottle/Can);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Bottle 5% Pours great with a lovely head caramel taste in the background, But not as I remember it, no body and weak and watery No substance or hop taste either.
Badger Tanglefoot (Bottle/Can);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Can brewed in England. Aroma of pear and a little hops. Gold in colour. Large, moderately-lasting head with a fair few bubbles. Moderate-light carbonation, taste is earthy malt with some grassy hop lurking in the background. A touch metallic at the end, but then a lingering biscuity maltness. Something of an indoor, slightly later in the day beer.

Twiggy English hops throughout, with a bit of lemon here, some farmyard there. Might have worked better in a darker bitter, but lacks the crispness you want in a golden ale. Pretty poor really.

Ballards Nyewood Gold;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ballards;500ml bottle. Felt slightly over carbonated on opening but then its bottle conditioned and a bit livelier than filtered ales. Yeast profile was the most discernable element. I brew my own full mash ales and this was remeniscent of ales I’ve brewed in the past. I’ve had this on tap before and its alot hoppier from the barrel. Doesnt really work from the bottle.

Ballards Wassail;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;Ballards;3rd beer on a ’random tasting evening’ with myself on 21st July 2017. 500ml bottle BBE July 2017, obtained from the English Heritage site at Roman Wroxeter (Shropshire). Poured slowly into a lovely vase shaped pint glass, badged for ’Old Speckled Hen’. Misty light brown pour, a dirty amber maybe: full and deep off-white blanket of foam on top. Shit, it’s been skunked, left in the sun on a shelf for too long: can’t drink it: bollox! I hate pouring beers down the sink, but this is undrinkable. Scored as I found it.
Ballards Wassail;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;Ballards;"Bottle. Orangey/Red in colour. Very prominent deep creamy head. Fruity; tangy citrus-fruity, orange marmalade. Malty; toasty malts, caramel, toffee. Hoppy; rather earthy hops. Spicy. Rather vinous. Alcohol quite noticeable. Sweet fruity throughout leading to a dry malty finish. Enjoyed this. Good beer! (2009-07)"
Ballards Wassail;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;Ballards;Bottle from Warkworth Castle. Gusher. Pours murky amber brown with a thick off-white head. Aromas are bretty, this has clearly picked up a wild yeast somewhere along the line. Loads of sherbet, wood, funky yeast and forest floor. Unintentional, I’ll bet, but actually not bad. Taste is red fruit, wood, horse blanket. Dry finish. Better than expected, for a bottle that’s probably sat on the shelf in a warm gift shop for nearly a year.
Ballards Wassail;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;Ballards;"English Heritage branded bottle.

Yards Old Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Yards Brewing Company;Sweet, roasty and vinous. The plummy dark fruit flavors blend with a little bit of toffee and maple and there are blackberries and acidity in there too. Ends witha dry (tobacco?) note and a hint of smoke/char. May be past its porime (’99 bottle) but still quite tasty.
Yards Old Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Yards Brewing Company;1999 Vintage (tasted on 1/5/05). Poured a dark reddish-brown with a huge (almost 5 finger) off white head. Aromas and tastes of dark fruits (raisins), chocolate, licorice and a little smoky. Some sour cherries lurking in the background and at the finish. Lightly sweet. Lively carbonated body with a nice dry finish. This one aged well and I’m glad I picked it up.
Yards Old Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Yards Brewing Company;(Vintage 1999) Huge light brown head of tiny bubbles. Settles very slowly. Great carbonation which keeps a thin foam on the surface. Rich aroma of raisins, chocolate covered cherries, tobacco and a dusty dryness. Color is a deep dark brown/red. Bit of sweetness and a good helping of raisins, dry smoky tobacco and a nice bitterness. Finish is dry and a little bitter. Very good old ale that has aged well. Little strange flavor in that it is very dry and dusty. Still quite good though.
Yards Old Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Yards Brewing Company;Pours with a huge, rocky head that refuses to settle down. It leaves an impressive lace, actually more of a sea foam impression than lace. The aroma is mostly malt sweetness with a hint of cherry. The taste is interesting. Very prominent malt flavors which remind me of a good bourbon's sweetness. Some fruitiness is also apparent, but it doesn't seem to be a single flavor. The alcohol is noticable, and the finish is a touch too bitter in that the bitterness seems to linger. And with all the sweetness, there is a slight sourness on the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little edgy, with strong carbonation attacking the tongue and gums. This may help offset the sweetness a touch.
Yards Old Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Yards Brewing Company;This is a strong beer with a sweet flavor. It can be cranky at times. It's at its best if you get it cask conditioned.

Poured a light orange or dark yellow with tiny body particles of average thickness and a very small, fizzy, off-white head that mostly diminished. The aroma was light citrus hops, light doughy yeast and vanilla. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and lightly acidic; while the finish was heavily acidic and very sour with an average duration. there was citrus, slight vanilla and a little funk then a ton of sour lime. the light to medium body was watery then dry with tingly carbonation and a moderate to heavy astringent finish."

I started a thread asking if this was past its prime recently , as the oneline Fullers shop had bottles going , this stuff is becoming obscure to locate . The view from my thread was differing on its condition ! I cracked this bitch open today as its FA cup final day .A classy sherry malt nose , cake , booze , jamish cherry . paint , wood ,. A sophisticated accent .. poured out glowing burnt peach with a small’ish beige head . this feels more robust and potent than 8/5 %.. which is a inevitable at this age . It is pretty soulfull on the palate . Loads of rich malt , earthy muddy hops , bitter nutty roast , cherry covered caramel dimensions that become burnt . On reflection this is in the middle of my expectations ...I expected it would be more haggard ,but hopped for something awesome and complex..it is somewhere in-between both.

Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Aroma and flavor is caramel/malts, a bit of earthiness and a fruit/slightly hoppy finish.
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);"Bottle. Orangey Gold. Malty; biscuity malts, caramel. Fruity; light grapefruit-citrus. Hoppy; slight grassy hops. Sweet malty fruity. Quite dry. Drinkable. OK. (2008)"
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Bona cervesa, bastant equilibrada i gustosa. Buena cerveza, bastante equilibrada y sabrosa.
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Bottle. This is a decent golden ale but nothing worth seeking out. Straight forward simple brew.
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Light hazy yellow. Aroma of fruit and butterscotch. Taste is thin, a bit sweet, a bit sour, and some bitterness late in the aftertaste. Not much flavour.
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);I think that many of the previous reviewers may have had out of date bottles, hence odd aroma and taste. My bottle was fresh (@ Sergio’s World Beer Bar in Louisville) as it was recently obtained and brought over from the brewer. Pours a hazy dirty orange with a good bubbly white head, big streaks of lace. Yes, the taste is full caramel malt (as are many British session ales), and there is some candied fruit in a mildly hoppy finish, but I could find nothing wrong here. It is a good example of the style, and, as such, I recommend it.
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Claims to be the first ever organic beer brewed (back in the 1990’s). Good for Spock and other Vegans I suppose. This 500ml brown bottle had a best before date of 26 Sep 2008, I drank it a month later. Poured into a Batemans pint glass, it was a golden slightly hazey colour with a good sized white head which slowly faded to a collar and a wispy covering. The aroma was of flowers and cut grass, very floral indeed. The beer was spritzy more than fizzy, a twang of citrus fruits in the taste. Unlike most UK brewed beers I’ve had. Sadly there was something missing, where was the 5% alcohol, where was the bitterness I was expecting and like? Overall not too bad, it just lacked that bitterness I require in a UK pint.
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Bottle pours a murky dark gold with a tiny off white head. Scent is yeast and earth. Taste is same.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Tasted this in the Saltcot, Saltcoats (JDW) in January 2000. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear mahogany in colour with a thin creamy white head. Strong distinctive Caley aroma of soft toffee. Thin but creamy texture to the mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt complex gives a robust maltloaf base with sweet notes of velvet butterscotch, dates, maple syrup and rum soaked raisins. No strong hop presence noted in the short aftertaste as sweetness continues into the toffee laced malty finish. A cracking take on the old ale style and ticks all the right boxes for me. Excellent session ale to celebrate the national bard.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask Handpump at the Beer House, Manchester 25/01/2003 Golden coloured and slightly rich on the palate. Lasting malt hop finish.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Bottle Conditioned. Dingy brown with short head. I have been looking forward to this for a while, after all a Scottish (for now) Brewery producing a beer in the name of its favourite poet (some might say), it must be good. Well this is a real stinker, sweet and plummy are the best adjectives I can give it, other than that a total waste of time, no body, no interesting asides, a flabby raw ale as R.B would say.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask at The Anchor, Birmingham. No head, some lacing, pleasant caramel aroma. This was a nicely sweet brew, with big dollops of toffee and lemon. Very slight bitterness on the finish, but fairly restrained. A rather nice brew.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Handpump, Head of Steam, Euston, London. From previous comments, it seems this might be rather better from the cask than from the bottle. Mid brown colour. Malt dominates the aroma, as expected. Although it was smooth and slightly sweet in the mouth, in the Scottish style, there was also plenty of bite to balance that out and, if fact, it finished quite dry. Medium bodies, well balanced and easy drinking. A nice drop.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);This beer started life as bottle conditioned, then became pastuerised. The claim on my 2002 version is that it has become bottle conditioned again. This is a pleasant brew with a nice yeasty/brown bread after taste - but slightly spoiled by the straight ahead sugar sweetness.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Supposed to be bottle conditioned but was as clear as a bell and no sediment in bottle. Citrus hops on the nose followed by a hint of malt. Chewy body with hints of caramel and toffee backed up with a yeasty bite in the finish.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask at Sports Bar & Grill, Crossrail Place. It pours a clean amber color with a small off white head. Aroma is nutty and grassy with notes of bread and custard. Taste is also medium crispy bready with more notes of caramel, straw and grass. Light bodied with soft carbonation. Overall, quite nice
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Tasted this in the Last Post, Paisley (JDW) in March 2000. Cask, handpump dispense. An interesting mahogany brown in colour with a thick creamy off white head. Strong caley toffee really evident in the lingering aroma. Thick creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt complex gives thick chewy mouthfeel of maltloaf and sweet butterscotch. Slight citric taint of hop flowers but sweet toffee malt floods the finish with chewy biscuit flavours. An enjoyable session ale this but maybe too sweet for some.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);A ruby coloured ale, with a malty nose ,and a wattery smooth full sweet flavour with toffeish tones and bitter linger
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Pint off pump. Poured a thick reddy brown with a good and sustained off-white head. Aroma was faint, with hints of malt and fruitiness. A pleasant beer but not all that much flavour: a little hoppy with hints of malt and fruit. Sweet. Extremely smooth and goes down well. Not bad, but reminds me of a lot of ’rugby themed’ beers.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask at Charlies. Amber coloured. Fruity aroma. Fresh and fruity flavour with malty notes.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask at Charlie’s. Pale / amber appearnce. Flavour is sweet and slightly stickky. Some butter in the falvour adds character. Finish is bitter with hints of prunes?
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask conditioned @ Humble Plumb, Soton. Pale copper colour. Citrussy hops and sweet caramelised malts. Some fruitiness in the body but balanced by a smooth bitter finish.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask handpull at Thomas Ingoldsby, Canterbury. Golden with lasting off white head. Soft but minerally, some sulphur, like many Caley beers. Creamy, citrus finish with soft, creamy floral caramel aroma. Soft and eggy in mouth. Finish has some tingle to it.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask conditioned @ ’The Freshie’ Formby. Golden coloured beer. Quite sweet with some fruitiness. More malt than hops but finishes with a strong hint of bitterness.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Interesting flavor, it is like creamy and sour. But stills being bitter, I like this kind, makes me not dislike all ales.
Caledonian Murrayfield Grand Slam;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask Conditioned at The Lampett Arms, Tadmarton. Dark brown beer with bubbly head. Strange mixture of weak ingredients and sour grapes. Sold just as Murrayfield in England as their last grand slam was a while ago.
Caledonian Flying Scotsman (Retired);Edinburgh, Scotland;Mild Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask at the Goat and Tricycle, Bournemouth. Retired? Clearly not. A clear reddish brown pour with a white frothy head. A rather spicy aroma which leads to a very refreshing spicy malty taste. The spiciness sticks around for a while too. Quite an unusual ale and I'd love to know the hops they use! A really great beer suitable for any time of the year. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Caledonian Flying Scotsman (Retired);Edinburgh, Scotland;Mild Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);First tasted this ruby ale in the Bull Inn, Paisley in December 1996. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear ruby in colour with a thick white creamy head. Caley trademark of highland toffee in the lingering aroma. Creamy smooth mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt complex gives a moist maltloaf flavour with rum soaked raisin notes and toffee. Slight prickle of hop resins in the short aftertaste. Malt is dominant in the fruity finish with caramelised strawberry evident. An excellent Scottish ruby ale and sadly missed.
Caledonian Flying Scotsman (Retired);Edinburgh, Scotland;Mild Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);From memory as it was the One cally beer i really liked and ive not seen it in ages (probably needs retired) ... Dark malt and fruity. 3.6

Caledonian Flying Scotsman (Retired);Edinburgh, Scotland;Mild Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask conditioned - handpump - JDW Northampton. A dark brown beer with a slight ruby hue. The aroma has some fruit, some mocha but also some typical Caledonian diacetyl. The taste is malty with caramel, coffee and more diacetyl. Could be really good but let down by signature notes.
Caledonian Flying Scotsman (Retired);Edinburgh, Scotland;Mild Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Dark looking, heavy tasting and gorgeous. Hamilton Hall, Liverpool St., London. Tasty as hell. The type of thing I want on at any festival.
Caledonian 125;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);First tasted this ale in Coanes, Johnstone in September 1995. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear amber in colour with a thin white creamy head. Strong aroma of highland toffee, long in intensity. Creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a smooth creamy toffee flavour through the chewy digestive biscuit base. Slight dusty hop prickle evident but does not impact on the sweet malty finish. A cracking session ale and sadly missed.
Caledonian 125;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Sampled cask conditioned. Bronze coloured. Flowery aroma. Sweet, medium bodied, lighlty soapy mouthfeel. Medium bitterness.
Caledonian Golden Pale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);500ml bottle from Shropshire. Vintage 1997. Some carbonation, soon fading. Stale/vintage flavours and aroma- cardboard and stale bread and some mould. Few hops. Some soggy biscuit sweetness. Not a lot happening here.
Caledonian Golden Pale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);My wife and I really disagreed on this. She liked it quite well, but I wasn’t so sure (of course I’m writing the review, so I win). It had lots of flavor in it, but it also had a skunky, musty side to it. A fairly standard english style bitter, a little too carbonated.
Caledonian Golden Pale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask Handpump at the Counting House, Glasgow (JDW) 07/07/2001 Golden coloured with some pale malt and sweetness.
Caledonian Golden Pale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Small head from a vigorour pour with large, fluffy,soapy bubbles on top. Grape and pear aroma with a bit of spices. Very interesting and good aroma. Some raisins in there also. Color is a medium orange/brown. Bitter, rusty, gritty flavor and mouthfeel. Not very plesant. Nice roasted character develops after the swallow. Thin body with some hops. Beer started off pretty damn good but fell flat on its face.
Caledonian Golden Pale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Hazy amber body topped by small beige head. Aroma is earthy, peach and light orange. Taste is earthy, medium sweet, light orange. Watery, undercarbonated medium body.
Caledonian Golden Pale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Bottled. Golden with a hint of orange. Nose is malty, some caramel notes, bit of zippy spice. Odd, odd, flavor. Definite maltiness, nutty quality I tend to associate with British ales. Has a very noticeable whiskey flavor, like a bottled boilermaker. While the abv is low, it actually seems to have a whiskey burn to it, very subtle, but definitely some odd harshness going on. Also quite yeasty in the finish, perhaps some kind of brewing problem here? Really enjoyed the creaminess of it, but too many odd things going on flavor-wise to really like this one.
Caledonian Golden Pale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask: Reminds me much of their IPA with its citrussy palate. A touch of spice and sweet malts add a nice level of complexity.

Castle Eden Ale;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Camerons Brewery (UK);Production of Castle Eden has now ceased at Camerons, and the brewery at Seaham that bought the name have started to make it. The first batch (this is at the Dun Cow in Durham City) was dreadful and had to be returned, very pale and thin bodied with bitterness in the aftertaste, nothing at all like CEA. Camerons stepped in and made an “emergency” batch, but the Seaham brewery then brewed again and I never tasted that as it too was rejected. Watch this space. Update. 19th Oct 2017. The Seaham brewery made a batch that was drinkable, and CEAesque, but still not the body and still lighter in colour. Update. 23rd Oct 2017. Still being made at Hartlepool by Camerons. The Seaham lot still can’t get it
Camerons Nimmos XXXX;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Camerons Brewery (UK);I’ll have to re-rate this, I thought it was ok but I was so thirsty I couldn’t even blink. Caramel,fruity hoppage, watery finish, some bitterness. Not bad I suppose.
Camerons Nimmos XXXX;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Camerons Brewery (UK);Golden, quickly disappearing head. When I pour this one, the notes of hops and flower spreads around the table. The flavour has floral, hoppy notes of fruit. The bitterness is medium, but develops in the finish. A nice and uncomplicated ale.

Camerons Nimmos XXXX;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Camerons Brewery (UK);Bottle. Metallic, dusty aroma. Golden colour, small, unstable white head. Starts off with an OK bitterness, turns dusty. A little watery.
Camerons Nimmos XXXX;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Camerons Brewery (UK);"Quite hazy, dirty-orange beer with greenish shine; no head to speak of. Vague parsley nose, and a bit nutty (slightly ""overdue"" bottle). Both nutty and slightly grassy taste, some caramel apparent, even a bit toasted. Finish is metallic, but not really bitter. Very empty palate, watery MF, just a little burning sensation. If this ""gave the Northeast a reputation for strong flavoursome ales""... Oh, well, I’ve had TTLandlord aplenty, and I suppose it must be better on cask."

Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Deep golden color with a big foamy white head. Good hoppy nose has a fruity character. Malty semisweet flavor upfront. Finish is clean and lightly tangy. Sour malt aftertaste.
Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;12oz can (Old Notes)-Pours golden with no head. Aroma of sweetness. Taste of the same with alcohol. This light to medium bodied brew is not a bad malt liquor. Light you up.
Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;always knew where we had gone to drink this when I was a kid. We just followed the trail of puke. Has to be drunk cold and fresh. Gets the job done but ditch the flat backwash no matter what. Only American beer I could get my cousins from the UK hammered on. Does taste like booze, oily and burns the roof of your mouth but has improved flavor over I remember it.
Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"12 oz. can. When I was in college, we used to drink these and say ""let’s go out and maximize."" Twenty five years ago, this was the strongest beer you could find. The alcohol is not at all hidden, there is a definite burn. Really not a bad beer, but let’s face it, if you’re drinking this one, you’re looking to get lit!"
Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Oh, god. What a beer this is. I can feel my head pounding in the morning after splitting a 22 oz. of this and moving on to utica club. I believe that the exact flavour profile of this beer has become completely blurred in my mind due to a painfully high number of cigarettes smoked that evening. In short, this beer exists to get you drunk. The $2.18 plus deposit and tax that two of these babies cost you will bring you a morning of pain, regret and blank shame.
Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;I actually liked this malt liquor when I tried it. Then again I was on a drinking binge with a bunch of like minded Neanderthals. Goes great with chocolate cake for breakfast. Well, maybe Matt won’t be using that in their next ad campaign.
Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;8.99%, three of these 24 oz bottles and you will be swinging from the trees. This stuff really blew me away. Taste is a little overpowering, but when you're good and banged up, does it really matter?
Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;While doing my Colt 45 review I remembered this beer from the 80's. It was harsh, but the fastet buzz from beer I ever had. I'm glad I have not seen it since.

Ditto the taste. Soft palate, a little watery and sweet, carbonation low. Finish a little tanniny. A very solid bitter bitter. Not saying 3.7% - this has some real character.

City of Cambridge Boathouse Bitter;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;City of Cambridge Brewery;23rd April 2015: 500ml bottle shared with my wife in bright sunshine on our patio.

City of Cambridge Boathouse Bitter;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;City of Cambridge Brewery;Bottle from Waitrose. Light brown. Clear with reasonable head & lots of lacing.

Hazy dark brown with a small dissapearing tan-coloured foam.LPeasant malty aroma of nuts, fudge, earth and cold coffee with an yeasty undertone. Flavour is rather thin of cold coffee and milky chocolate with sourish undertone. Thin-bodied. Short nutty, sourish aftertaste with a low bitterness. Infected?
City of Cambridge Jet Black;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;City of Cambridge Brewery;Cask : The Wenlock, Hoxton. As its name suggests it was black! Quite a rich and full mouthfeel for a low abv beer, nice and easy to drink with an ok body but no finnish. But of roastyness in there somewhere

River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;Pours a hazy amber in the glass. Nose and taste is malts, sweet fruits and barley. Rated 6/8/02
River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;Sweet, yeasty and fruity aroma with some bready and caramel malt character. Opaque golden body with a low white head that recedes to ring. Sweet and fruity flavour is mildly bitter with some cakelike yeast. Medium body with somewhat low carbonation. Bottle sampled at the Country Inn with beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, Rastacouere and Yowie.
River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy golden color with a ring of white lace. Aroma of malt, fruits and yeast. The flavor feels a bit off with a package of fruits and yeast. The body is light with a creamy texture and soft carbonation.
River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;The Lure: Fruity esters and wheaty cereals personify a Belgian origin. Soft caramel and honey sweetness benefits from some orange pith to diversify its reach. Interesting, but definitely not what is expected from the style designation. The Festivities: Rich caramel and honey combine to coat the phenolic haystack. Their slick sweetness works well with the pears and other fruity esters of the apparently Belgian yeast. Few hops can be detected, and raw grain keeps things fresh. Good, but I thought I had ordered a bock? Transcendence: Clothing can mask true natures easily.
River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;Hazy pale gold appearance, almost no head. Tartish sourdough and cerealic bready and floral nose. Banana touched doughiness is tamed by bandagey phenols and a beginning of cardboardy oxidation. Medium bodied, watery mouthfeel, rather sweet. Not very exciting.
River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;On tap at Porterhouse Brewpub. Yellow color. Mostly clean aroma. Clean and crisp with some hops in the finish. Nice beer.
River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;On tap at the Porterhouse Brewpub (owned by River Horse) in Lahaska, PA. 8% abv and known as Spring Bock.

River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;Same lame labels from this brewery - when will they realize that using a home inkjet printer for their beer labels just won't cut it? As for the brew, the aroma is sweet, yeasty and just plain terrific. I enjoyed the malt flavor, but the alcohol could have been more well-hidden. Overall, a decent effort and I'm glad to see them try to brew a challenging style.
River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;Hazy golden body with small off-white head. Aroma is fairly light, apple and light straw. Taste is pretty sweet, though not cloying, basically apple and caramel, with a hint of alcohol. Minimal bitterness, and fairly light body. Quite guzzle-able.
River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;Lightest looking bock I've ever seen, more like a hazy-orange wheat beer in appearance, with almost no head. Not promising. Nose is one-dimensional candy-sweet, all right but my hopes aren't increasing. Flavor also very sweet, sticky, tiny bit smoky, rather boring. This was really a nothing for a bock, a style I usually like a lot.
Mad Crab Sturgeon Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout;Mad Crab Restaurant and Brewery;Warm coffee & cocoa aroma deceives you for what you are about to taste - sour, stinging - very unpleasant.
Mad Crab Sturgeon Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout;Mad Crab Restaurant and Brewery;My 200th beer! Unbelieveably nice aroma, very strong roasted coffee smell. Thick, tan head that lasted. I was shocked at the dichotomy between the aroma and flavor though. It tastes very sharp and sour, not what I was expecting at all. It was very hard to drink.

Mad Crab Riptide Wheat;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;Mad Crab Restaurant and Brewery;This light crisp brew had a hint of vanilla in the aroma which I found pleasant. Kind of reminded me of Blue Moon. Served with a lemon.
Mad Crab Buzz Beer;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mad Crab Restaurant and Brewery;Wow! Another unique taste! Hard to describe - really good and refreshing....
Mad Crab Buzz Beer;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mad Crab Restaurant and Brewery;Obviously borrowed the name from the Drew Carey Show (Strongsville is pretty close to Cleveland). Complex aroma that was hard to get a bead on. Some honey in the flavor. Thin head and lacing. Different, but not great.
Mad Crab Pirates Pilsner;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Mad Crab Restaurant and Brewery;Huge bubbled foam atop a light golden liquid. Fresh, dry aroma including sour apples, plaster, and oxidation. Far too much carbonation, bottle conditioned, to make this work. Finishes extremely dry and numbing. Why waste time on such a beer? Practically worthless.
Mad Crab Pirates Pilsner;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Mad Crab Restaurant and Brewery;I don't know if it was the glass or the beer - but I smelled vinegar. The taste wasn't bad - but I still don't care for pilsners.
Mad Crab Pirates Pilsner;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Mad Crab Restaurant and Brewery;Vinous flavor, thin off-white head. Decent lacing. I detected hints of ginger and brown sugar as well. Not bad.
Theakston Prince of Ales;Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Theakston;Bottle conditioned. Bottled in 1981.

Darwin Evolution Ale;Sunderland, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Darwin Brewery;Tasted this at the Paisley Beer Festival in April 2001. Cask, gravity dispense. Clear dark amber in colour with a thin buff head. Stunning aroma with burning peat hags and carmelised orange notes - wonderful stuff. Smooth oily mouthfeel and good lacing. Mixed malts give a robust maltloaf base with caramel, molasses and orange peel notes evident. Citric hops give a dry fruity aftertaste long in intensity. Malt returns in the toffee and orange oil finish. An excellent session bitter and well recommended.
Darwin Evolution Ale;Sunderland, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Darwin Brewery;A Mes rate: Cask at the Wenlock (I think). Fresh and hoppy all round with some grapefruit and a crisp and very bitter finish. Very dry but not in a bad way. Decent beer.

Darwin Killer Bee;Sunderland, Tyne & Wear, England;Strong Ale - English;Darwin Brewery;I'd actually like to speak a bit about a different Killer Bee than is listed - the one from Tin Whistle of Penticton, BC. This dark honey beer has an understated complexity, where you can find such diverse flavours as tobacco, chocolate, coffee, malt, smoke, and honey. The beer has that honey-ish crispness, and is made from 5 malts, 3 hops, 4 honeys and some spice.

Lancaster Amish Four Grain Ale;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lancaster Brewing Co.;as an amber color about itself, with good carb’s and an avg. head that fades quickly to a foamy ring about the glass. A spicy malt aroma with an earthy hop bouquet. A spicy malt taste similar to Beligem brews. Hop flavor is very understated with a slight earthy or woodiness taste. The use of four grains gives a complex flavor. spicy from the rye and smooth from oats. Medium body with a bitter finish and dry after taste. I would like to taste more hop flavor to balance out the maltiness. I could drink a few of these but would change out after about two.
Lancaster Amish Four Grain Ale;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lancaster Brewing Co.;"Transferred from BA reviewed on 2-1-12 - Poured from bottle into pint glass. Appearance - Pours a rusty–copper color with a off white head; the color not quite so” pale” as the categorization implies. The head fades leaving very little lacing. Smell –Rye maltiness is the main aroma detected. This maltines however is mixed with a fair degree of sweeter aromas as well; mainly some caramel and toffee as well as some wheat and an ever so light toasted nut, which seems almost none existent in the beginning, but shows up at the end. Taste – Sweet caramel and rye malt are the backbone of the brew and seem ever present. A very light hop spiciness, mostly earthy in , is present at the start, but seem to fade quite fast, giving way to an even greater level of sweetness, with the caramel flavor mixing with some lighter fruit flavors,;a bit of banana, and some other sweeter flavors of vanilla. The taste transition is light and very smooth. Quite nice!! Mouthfeel – The rye flavor seems to blanket the tongue with a nice creaminess; a much creamier tongue feel then would have been expected. The carbonation level seems to be right on par, making it a very easy drinking and enjoyable brew. Overall – This is quite nice and very flavorful brew. The rye and sweet flavors and aroma are all quite smooth and enjoyable."

Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Cloudy amber body with a soft white head. Light, pale malt backbone with soft fruit notes and a soft, citric hop presence. Very soft mouthfeel and a nice, floral hop note on the finish. A tad watery but overall a nice example of the style.
Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Draft at Brouwer’s. Looks like this one is back with a vengeance. Pours a somewhat grainy and fairly opaque dark brown with caramel highlights. Thick and creamy dark tan head. Smells biscuity with a little bit of crackers there as well. Creamy medium body, very soothing and quenching right off. Biscuit, a bit of iced tea, and some light woody hop on the mid-palate. Definitely a very smooth and drinkable beer, easily a session champ. The flavor profile doesn’t look like much in print but it’s a nice one.
Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Hazy, dull amber. Almost anisey note in the otherwise fruity aroma. Lightly bitter with a sweet malt kiss. Light apricot, pear, and lime fruitiness. Malts are mainly pale. Subtle character. Finishes with a little bit of late acidity.

Sweet and soft with near full body. Somewhat citric. Solidly malty, but there is not much malt flavour. Salty bitter finish.
Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Bright red-amber beer with a creamy thick off-white head. Nice herbal, spicy hop aroma. Nice sweet malts, a bit of cherry fruitiness. Very woody hop flavour, fairly sweet with a nice resiny hop flavour. Lingering chewy bitterness. A nice pint.
Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;On tap at the Big Time Brewery in Seattle Pours dark orange-amber with a limited head. The aroma is dominated by the hops, but the flavor itself is surprisingly driven by sweet dried apricot and caramel malts, to the degree that it seems somewhat out of its listed category, ESB. This is a reasonable enough beer, and it made for pleasant drinking, though it’s not an outstanding offering.
Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Copper. More hops than malt in the aroma. Very hoppy and malty flavour. Similar to Matts IPA, again with a lot of sweetness.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Draft at BT. Clear gold pour. Aroma: green apples overwhelm the nose on this. Taste of honey, alcohol, apple, perfume. Sweet, with slight bitterness in the finish. Full body, soft carbonation, syrupy texture.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Tap @ the brewpub. Nice head with good duration. Color is golden. Aroma and taste are yeast, fruits, sugary notes, malt and hops.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Pours murky golden with minimal head. Smell is clove, a bit of banana, gum, and citrus. Taste is sweet and hoppy, a bit like La Fin Du Monde, but more hops, strong orange flavor on the finish. Decent.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Hmm...smells okay, but unfortunately this actually is a bit more alcoholic in flavor than I’d like. Some spices later, but not too strong, and not enough to cover the alcohol taste.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;2011 Belgianfest – Seattle, WA Golden yellow in color, clear with a thick white head.

Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;On cask at San Diego Real Ale Fest, Carlsbad (6/12/09): Pours a hazy golden bronze with a well-lacing frothy white head. Aroma of sweet fruity esters and toasty pale Belgian malts. Starts with good fullness and rich Belgian malty complexity with some doughy balance and coriander spice before a semi-sweet, drier finish. A pretty good and enjoyable Belgian strong ale.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Hazy dark golden with a lingering white sheen. Big yeasty, candi sugar, light pit fruit aromas. Medium body. Sticky sweet flavors of light pit fruits candi sugar and earthy yeast. Too sweet but still tasty. Draft@ Big Time.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Poured on draft at Naked City. Hazy, muddy orange, with a small, off-white head. This may have some of the notes of a tripel, but this is extremely undercarbonated for that style. Almost flat. A big hop presence, but not as crisp or fresh of hops as I’m used to - more like a subdued amount of something you’d find in a Port anniversary IPA. The aroma is very mild, and the flavor - while it has some of the characteristics of a tripel (spices, yeast, citrus) - falls miles short of what I expect of the style. If it didn’t claim to be a tripel, I might like this a bit more. It’s tasty, but something of a disappointment.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Clear golden with a dense white head. Sweet yeasty aroma balanced with some spices. Lots of banana, clove and citrus in the flavor, finishes off dry.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;Poured a dark copper brown, with a little haze, and a light head which quickly dissipated. It had a great malty, smoky aroma. With a hint of fruit, apples plum, dates. Taste was a disappointment. The start hits with a big malt/grain blast super sweet, and some carmel and fruit notes. In the middle the sweetness takes over the flavor, and that follows through the end. I am far from a hop head, but where is the bitterness, and balance to the beer. The mouthfeel was as expected for a quality brewery, and the drinkability suffers from the poor balance of the beer.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;Tawney auburn colored with a small light tan head. Big banana and light brown sugar aroma. Moderate body, livly carbonation. Rich malt slighty sweet. Complex bus atertaste. Very nice.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;A little tangy in the aroma. Dark muddy color. Red/brown. Smokey interesting flavor but nothing out of the ordinary. A little light.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;Probably totally mislabelled by Big Time as a weizen bock, but still an absolutely fantastic wheat. Murky dark brown, OK head, but perfect lacing. Big spicy clove nose. Flavor was a great balance, caramel and a wonderful burst of esters, restrained bananas, and clean clove flavors. Spicy bitterness on finish. Top notch, I really liked this. Tap at pub.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;Draught End-of-scale dark brown with a red & olive shine. Very dense small head, yellow. Banana, cloves, sweet apple, the whole shebang. Even some bread. At least, it’s true to style. Sweet, fruity esters, yeasty with a very high level of restsweetness. Fusels and even phenols, coloured malt. Full bodied, slick but a bit cloying. Just OK Dunkelweizen. 5% ABV is not a Bock, and neither was it announced as such in the pub.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;Another one of my favorites, not quite as big as I like in this style, but still a tasty session sipper. Rich and slightly spicy, with a heavy mouthfeel, that has kind of a chewy maltiness. Fruity with a somewhat sour finish.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;"On tap at the brewery. Pours a muddy light brown;the aroma is pungent with sizzling bacon. The taste is strong, rye-spicy, and idiosyncratic; lots of yeast with a bitter if slightly metalic finish. Palate is thick, hard to believe it’s only a 5% beer; the overall drops slightly short of the sum of the parts."
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;draft. very thin head an what was there had a combination of large and fine bubbles, full rich aroma, cloudy brown red, unique flavor and finish.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;Dark and unfiltered, but with a light body look as well. Nice, full wheaty taste with a bit of bitterness on the finish. A solid beer for all seasons and one of the better beers of the dunkelweizen style. Rerate: 5-06-03: This time the beer had a barrel aged quality with the appearance of complexity adding vinegar notes in aroma and taste. This shaped the beer differently, in fact, maybe it was a different recipe, but just as good.
Big Time Beam Me Up Scottish Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Big Time Brewery;(Draught) Sampled at Big Time Brewpub in Seattle on March 2, 2007. Lasting white head with a light mahogany body. Another milky smell with strong malt basis. Initial scotch flavour with a heavy malt finish. Average beer.
Big Time Beam Me Up Scottish Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Big Time Brewery;My impression of this was that it tastes like they threw a few bottles of cheap whiskey into a pale ale. I like Scottish ales alot, too, and this one was just so one dimensional. No body, too pale and dry, and really just not a very good example of the style, if nothing else.
Big Time Beam Me Up Scottish Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Big Time Brewery;A good peaty, malty, earthy scottish ale with a slightly nutty finish. Slightly thin

Big Time Beam Me Up Scottish Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Big Time Brewery;This is odd.Almost perfect texture in mouth - chewy, heavy viscous - but lacking in flavors. Tastes almost like an English brown.
Big Time Beam Me Up Scottish Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Big Time Brewery;Cloudy brown with an off-white-yellow head. Sweet floral/fruity aroma. Semi-sweet favor with quite a bitter kick (for a scottish ale anyhow). Mouthfeel somewhat on the thin side, but smooth. Good brew.
Big Time Beam Me Up Scottish Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Big Time Brewery;"This cola-brown ale was a little disappointing at first sight: slightly hazy with a fairly light, fuzzy head---aroma slightly sweet, slightly fruity, but the watchword here is ""slight."" As for flavor, the keyword is ""subtle."" Malt is detected mostly in the body, and contributes to a very nice mouthfeel. Hops, meanwhile, stand out most in the medium dry finish, which fills the back of the palate. There is nothing wrong with this ale--but it is almost annoyingly plain...Smooth and full-bodied it is, but somehow the character of this ""Scottish"" ale got lost in the transporter beam and landed somewhere else--unfortunately, far from the land of kilts and cabers."
Big Time Old Wooly Barleywine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;Copper. Powerful sweet booze up front. Caramel, sweet ripe fruit, dough, toffee, and more booze. Finish is lingering boozy heat and a sweet toffee note forms, as well. Medium to full bodied. I wasn’t expecting quite the boozy profile but once I got past that it was really a nice BW.
Big Time Old Wooly Barleywine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;On tap at Hopvine. Impressive, even to my two friends who don’t usually care for large beers but found this one complex and clean. Has that crispness so more the spirit of a cocktail than a beer. Tasted like it was barrel aged but it wasn’t--alcohol and wood, hops largely int he background but not much overt sweetness either.
Big Time Old Wooly Barleywine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;[3/2/15] Draught at Big Time Brewery in Seattle. Clear amber.

Big Time Old Wooly Barleywine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;2008 Bottle (from box) Courtesy of Edmund Edmunds Pours a deep red color, plenty hazy with a really small wispy ol’ head. The aroma is rich, it’s got lots of caramel, some cooked fruit, some brown sugar... invitingly sweet smelling. The flavor is rich & sweet, it’s got loads of toffee, lots of fruity cherry and apple bits. There is a touch of bitterness left in it, but that’s pretty light. Some vanilla rounds it out well. The mouthfeel is big, but lightly sharp. A real chill boost.

Tastes of all the same things in the smell with slight dark fruit in the flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy but slight chewy with ok carbonation and a dry finish. Overall its pretty average for a barleywine. I was expecting a little more out of it it seemed a little off balanced Maybe it will taste better with age.

A nice way to finish the quarter. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Big Time Old Wooly Barleywine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;Bomber of 2012 Vintage. Pours a dark burgundy and amber color with a layer of light reddish brown foam. Lots of orange, grapefruit peel and pine resin in the aroma followed by some caramel, malt and dark fruit in the background. The flavor is heavy on the hops resin and citrus rind upfront leading to notes of brown sugar, honey, raisin and toffee. The body is moderately thick and creamy with low carbonation and a citrusy, alcohol-warming finish. Overall, it’s significantly hoppy fresh but should be a lot maltier and smoother with a few years of age on it. Well done.

Big Time Yulefest Christmas Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;Draft at Big Time. Pours dark brown -- I’d like to say there was a reddish tint to it, but I’d be making that up. Aroma: dark fruit mostly, along with a little Christmas spice. Taste: Sweet up front, light bitterness, short finish. Palate: medium body, slick texture. Overall: I’m sticking to Old Rip for the next round, but this is nice enough (I feel like I use that phrase a lot with Big Time, but it sums up a lot -- solid beers that are executed nicely enough, with really nothing to complain about).

Big Time Scarlet Fire IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;Tap at the brewery. Plastic cup? First beer of the West Coast Brewery Road Trip. Consumed with commonshawn and rosskyle. Aroma is essentially standard IPA...hops and citrus. Attractive appearance that would have benefited from a pint glass. Taste leans more on the hop resin side of things. Mild tropical fruit. End is mostly bitter with hops taking over. A decent beer. Feels like a precursor for a West Coast IPA-athon. Not big time...more middle time.

Big Time Kingfisher Best Bitter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Big Time Brewery;(Draft: Big Time Brewery and Alehouse in Seattle, WA) So, the beers here tend to have a funky aroma. Again, a stinky feet aroma creeps into the nose, though not as obvious as the Blonde. Otherwise, it smells somewhat sweet and grainy. Flavor is sweet and caramely, somewhat grainy, mildly bitter. Light golden colored body, small off-white head. Some patchy lacing is left along the top of the glass as the head fades to a ring. Not bad, but it’s basically just generic microbrewed beer to me.

Big Time Snowmelt American Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;"Draught Good, very fine yellowish & dense head; hazy orange-amber ale. Very grapey-hoppy nose, grapefruit, sweet-bitter, even in the nose. Sweetish, with a building-up bitterness, fruity, but less outspoken grapefruit flavour. Even more hops in the finish, balance however remains right. Creamy, the nitro helping, smooth but not cloying. OK, I’m not a big fan of nitrokeg, but here it seems to help the brewer fight the yeast/balance control problems. So why should I complain?"

Unfortunately, the flavor and mouthfeel simply can’t back up the promise that the nose offers; they’re too weak on the malt, too hollow, too thin to come through with anything like what one is anticipating given the nose. On the other hand, I might have been somewhat less disappointed had I realized this was a 3.6% beer and adjusted my palate expectations accordingly. I’d certainly drink it again happily, especially at lunchtime if one doesn’t want a beer pack the full punch of one of their better 7 or 8% strong ales. Coming back to this beer a second time on cask (and yet again on tap) and knowing that I was getting a 3.6%, I was even more impressed. I’ve bumped the rating upward a few points accordingly. If this beer tasted half as good as it smells, it would be darn near unbeatable under 4%. Unfortunately, even the foreknowledge that you’re dealing with a 3.6% beer doesn’t entirely cut the watery disappointment that follows the sublime aroma."
Big Time Snowmelt American Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;On Nitro: My rating may be effect by this. Orangy colour with a typical creamy nitro head. Nitro probably took some of the hop flavour but it did still have some nice hop aroma. Flavour was slightly bitter with the hops but balanced nicely with malts. Would like to try it without nitro some time.
Big Time Snowmelt American Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;The pub was serving this on nitro when I went, but I'm not adding the nitro version as a separate beer because I can't figure out that rule. It was served to me in full cascading mode and it took a while for the show to end. Clear orange with a creamy head typical of nitro beers. I was expecting all the hop flavors to be washed out by the nitro, but not at this place. The Cascade hops ride high on a strong, malt backbone. Great use of nitro.

Big Time Snowmelt American Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;Was called bitter the first time I had it.Lightly spiced hop nose. Flavor is also lighlty spiced but seems lacking in hops. Rather light and thin.
Big Time Snowmelt American Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;Hints of spiciness in the bouquet are what is expected of a winter brew. Honey-colored, with a pleasantly spicy body that is smooth, but a little light on the underside--with a finishing hoppy piquance. Rerate: Much better than I remembered (this is on nitro)--bronze with a creamy head--and honeyed hops. A nice APA to encounter in the winter.
Big Time Frostys Spiced Winter Warmer;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Time Brewery;Nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, almost pumpkin pie flavored. smooth and medium bodied.
Big Time Frostys Spiced Winter Warmer;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Time Brewery;Deep ruby color with a root beer head. The nose hinted at the spices to come, but it did not give any indication of the size and scope of the flavor. Tons of ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and other spices that seemed backed up by an almost chocolate sweetness. The hops were only allowed to come out at the very end. Very smooth mouthfeel but very aggresive spices. I bet it would mellow nicely, but there is no way it will last that long.
Big Time Frostys Spiced Winter Warmer;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Time Brewery;This refreshingly winter-redolent beer is remarkably true to its name. Pungent with cinnamon, cloves, and orange peel in this maroon colored ales that brings out the Christmas season. Nice warming sensation from this quintessential winter holiday selection.
Big Time Frostys Spiced Winter Warmer;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Time Brewery;Tastes and smells like a clovey apple pie. Man, it's been a while since I had a really good apple pie. Hey mom, if you see this can you pop a pie in the mail for me?

Big Time Matts Red Eye IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;"Draft at the brewpub. Pours deep leathery brown and quite hazy. Thin sudsy tan head. Very neutral nose; inoffensive. Medium body, active carb, resin-forward attack. Piney burny resiny bitter body and a long tobacco resin bitter cling finish. Barkeep mentioned that it has some roast malt in it; maybe under all the flavors I’m picking up is mainly roast. Nice stuff. Maybe not the most refreshing IPA in the world, but complex and satisfying and drinkable,"
Big Time Matts Red Eye IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;"Dark red, cloudy (of course), with a rocky head. Rich woody aroma, lots of subtle grapefruit and orange underneath. Slightly caramel-accented malt aromas. Rich and supple caramelly, woodsy malts and soft but insistent bitterness. Beautiful woody notes, light citrus, and faint chocolate. Excellent brew - almost the caramel taste of a great ""Irish"" red but with IPA hops."
Big Time Matts Red Eye IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;Tap at the brewery. This is IPA #100 for me. Pours dark, dark orange amber for an IPA. The aroma is a lovely, classic centennial IPA: grapefruit and peaches and a bit of spicy pine. The flavor is equally nice: not heavily burnt-malted despite its dark color, just tasty hops not hitting too hard, almost like a Drakes Expedition or similar heavily-hopped amber ale. Mildly sweet but not sticky, a very characteristic Big Time flavor to this one. Fairly light body and palate, but that just makes this one wonderfully drinkable. A very nice beer and worth trying any time it is on tap.
Big Time Matts Red Eye IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;Draft. Rich dark amber beer with an off-white head. Low malty, grapefruit aroma. Nutty, malty flavor with some backing bitterness. (For an IPA, where’s the hops??). Medium bodied. Lingering caramel and grapefruit.
Big Time Matts Red Eye IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;On tap. Nice cloudy dark red. Good head. Spicy and lemon hop aroma. Lemon citrus taste is pretty strong. Bitter hops. Not very balanced and a bit thin, but worth trying.

Big Time Powderfinger Rye Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Time Brewery;Decent tap beer. The rye is not showing a typical spicy character, nor do we get much IPA/hoppy profile. A quaffer.

Aroma is dry oaky caramel malt, fresh dark citrus on the hops. Taste is clean lightly sweet caramel malt, slightly darker than what you might expect from an IPA. Lots of fresh hops on the back, big juicy grapefruit and lighter pine notes here. Very much in the school of Sierra Nevada Celebration winter ale, which is a compliment.

Hop-forward nose is very inviting. Some metal comes through in the taste. Thick palate. A very nice, relatively clean IPA...Lift ticket on nitro. Hazed burnt orange. Stable nitro head. Earthy aroma. Lingering resins and grapefruit. Soft palate I like the nitro here better than in a stout! alcohol apparent tho needs to be toned down just a little. Has nice citris pith flavor. Finishes dry and with mild spice like roots and bark. Dandelion. 3,7,3,8,14 not bad but not outstanding.
Big Time Lift Ticket Winter Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;Cloudy copper with decent head. Fantastic ipa. Lots of c hops in the aroma and taste.

Big Time Lift Ticket Winter Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;Tap at Elysian Brewing. Cloudy copper-coloured beer. Big fruity hop aroma. Cascadey type with tropical papaya/pineapple flavour, peach/apricot. Aroma is quite intoxicating. Flavour is fairly malty though, despite the bit hoppy aroma. A bit of cherry fruitiness, hoppy flavour with a fairly complex malt bill as well (pale malt, some sweet honey and a bit of caramel sweetness). Well balanced with loads of sweet hoppy flavour. Lingering bitterness. Very tasty brew.

Pretty good Irish Dry Stout.
Big Time Buck Mulligans Dublin Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Big Time Brewery;Cask-cond’d version @ brewpub. Not much head on an opaque black beer. Aroma of simple coffee, some creamer, butter, and Coffee Crisp candy bar. Hardly any co2 but has a nice silkiness. Good smoky flavors and love the sweet soft licorice in the background. That does not overpower the the mild cocoa creme. Sweet in a licorice way and more woody, like toasty wood, than anything else at the end.

Big Time Buck Mulligans Dublin Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Big Time Brewery;Black with a creamy head and great lacing. Nose of smoke and roast malts. Beef jerky!? Todd concurs. Woody and more smoke in the flavor with some roast and bitter chocolate. Creamy palate of course (nitro) and thick smoke rolls through the finish.
Big Time Buck Mulligans Dublin Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Big Time Brewery;Sampled @ Big Time, April 2007 Pours with a rich, creamy, nitrogen generated head that has a brown tinged, tan color. The beer is simply black, when analyzed in this pub atmosphere. The aroma is rich with notes of toasty malt, chocolate, a touch of coffee aromatics and a hint of burn raisin adds some unexpected fruitiness. The beer tastes dry and fairly bitter in the finish. The bitterness seems to be driven by the burnt malt notes rather than by hops. A touch of coffee flavors are here, focusing on roast bean flavors. This has a very creamy mouthfeel to it, which is typical of a degassed nitrogenated brew. The finish has a lingering, toasted, dry grain character to it. This is a good easy drinking brew, and a definite step up from draught Guinness.
Big Time Buck Mulligans Dublin Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Big Time Brewery;Draft. Nitro. Blackish beer with a tan nitro head. Roasty aroma. Light flavor, slightly sour, slight roast. Lingering sourness/lactic. Lighter bodied.

Big Time Neighsayer Oatmeal Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Time Brewery;A lover of oatmeal stouts--this was a bit of a twist. Rich amber in appearance with a cream head giving off a feint, but pleasant oatmeal odor and tasting silkily and gently of oatmeal. A cross between a stout and a cream ale, althought the commercial description tells it is really an English bitter.

Big Time Sunbreak Blonde Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Time Brewery;Draft at brewery. This beer is messed up. It tastes like bark, I guess. Or very very old malt that is offputting. Yuck, I can’t do it. I just don’t understand.

Big Time Sunbreak Blonde Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Time Brewery;On tap at Big Time. Poured pale clear yellow/orange with a white head. Almost no aroma, but I think I detected a slight hint of orange. Light bitterness, light sweetness, light finish.
Big Time Sunbreak Blonde Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Time Brewery;Draft at Big Time. Pours a hazy light amber with coppery overtones. Loose white head. Mild grassy and biscuity nose. Creamy medium body with somewhat understated carb. A little bit of orange present on the mid-palate, but far underneath a toasty, biscuity, slightly grassy flavor profile. A classic well-enough-made blonde, very refreshing and easy to drink. Not a deeply inspired recipe but those are very hard to find in this style.

Big Time Sunbreak Blonde Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Time Brewery;Clear golden with thin head. Overly sweet for me, and non-existent hops. Wheat comes through more than a hint. Nice and light for a session beer, but not much to get excited about.

Aroma is sweet, slightly grainy malt forward with caramel and light candy notes. Appearance is clear yellow with a moderate white head. Flavor is bubblegum sweet malt with a true sugar note and low hop citrus. Mouthfeel is a little odd, with an odd graint/low carb texture on the tongue and a sweet finish. Overall, too candilike, but good and drinkable.
Big Time Brewer Bills Pumpkin Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Time Brewery;Amber with no head or lace really. Aromas of pumpkin spices and caramel malt. The flavor brings the pumpkin out more so. Crystal malts. Hops bitter and citrus. Very well done.

Pours golden slight chill haze soft head nicd lace. Bread saaz hops grass. Real bitter finish but i like bitter so its ok w me. Nice flavors but maybe tone bitterness down just a bit.
Big Time Pachyderm Pilsner;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Big Time Brewery;@ hopvine first review was pretty harsh, though not far from the mark. uber bitter and smells musky (like an elephant?)
Big Time Pachyderm Pilsner;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Big Time Brewery;Czech Saaz hops just don't do it for me--at all. This blonde colored ale is no exception with its stanky American standard flavor and unpleasantly bitter/sour finish. A yucky offering from Big Time (their worst) and a complete waste.
Big Time Hopfest;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;On tap at brewery: Really aromatic beer. Green, earthy, grassy and wholesome hop flavors. Sweet caramel malts complemented well. Tasty stuff.
Big Time Hopfest;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;On tap at Big Time in Seattle, WA--Poured a thin amber body with a small white head. Spicy, floral, nutty, creamy nose. Not very exciting for an IPA.
Big Time Hopfest;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;Clear amber with a tight viscous head that lingers. Nice, subtle aroma of spicy hop and cascade tree resins. Super smooth cask brew with pine tree hopflavors and a mild caramel malty sweetness to balance. My favorite beer style to drink cask, and this was a good one.
Big Time Hopfest;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;"Crystal. On tap at the brewery 12/30/05.Pours a pale, slightly cloudy amber with a modest head. The malt stays in the background, showcasing the cops but balancing nicely; the hops themselves offer with a lovely dry bitterness without the strong citrus-and-pine of many of the popular PacNW varieties. The mouthfeel is good, and the beer is superbly drinkable. (As an aside, I’d call this an American Pale Ale rather than an IPA.) 7/3/9/4/17=4.0. Amarillo. On tap at the brewery 7/22/06. Pours cloudy amber orange with a nice fluffy head. The aroma is divine, a piney, citric wonderment of Amarillo hops. The flavor - well, let’s not pretend that this is a complex or subtle beer. It’s not. It’s hop juice, and I mean than in a good way. This one is plain and simple a showcase for the hops, and with lovely hops like these, that actually works quite well. I pick up a bit too much alcohol and resin in the flavor (and the malts are hiding like scared fieldmice) but the hops come through with more big juicy flavor than bitterness, despite the fact that this is not a particularly sweet IPA. On the whole it works very well, and makes me glad to work just a few blocks from the Big TIme so that I can sample this sort of thing regularly. 9/4/7/3/15=3.8. The batch I sampled 6/18/09 was better rounded, less over the top than my notes indicate about the first go-around -- though some of this may have been that it was on cask. Mt Rainier. Tap at the brewery 7/4/2007. For me, this was a first encounter with this Hallertau-family hop variety. The aroma is modest but enjoyable; the flavor comes through not powerfully but with a pleasant complexity that compensates for the relatively thin malt backbone of the beer. It’s not at all a pine and orange blast like most of the Big Time IPAs, but rather we get a somewhat resiny, mildly floral, mildly spicy, well-balanced hop flavor that renders it a delicously drinkable beer, lighter in feel than Scarlet Fire or Baghwan’s. Nice! 7/4/8/4/15=3.8 Liberty. Tap at the brewery 12/21/07. Pours a cloudy amber with a nice head and strong lacing. Sweet, gentle nose of candied gummi peach and overripe bartlett pear. While the opening flavor is likewise sweet and soft, orchard juice warmed by gentle candied malt, it quickly turns to a bitter and somewhat astringent finish atop a noticeable diacetyl . The hops close soapy with a bit of grapefruit pith. Spot-on mouthfeel, the carbonation textured but not aggressive. Pretty good, but not among my favorites of their IPAs or even of their their hopfest varieties. 7/3/7/4/14=3.5 Ahtanum. Tap at the brewery 7/16/08. This hop makes for a really nice fruity IPA, on the sweet side but not sticky, just not aggressively bitter. Citrus and amarillo-like tropical fruits/peaches, a hint of wood. I really like this stuff. 8/4/8/4/15 =3.9"
Big Time Hopfest;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;Murky red-amber with a foamy white head and nice lacing. Light citrus and pine hops in the nose. Toasted malts.

Big Time Hopfest;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;(Draught) Sampled at Big Time Brewpub in Seattle on March 2, 2007. Lasting white head with a deep orange body. Nose is very piney. Not hoppy crisp but malt balanced in a strange way. Short bitter finish. Good stuff.
Big Time Hopfest;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Hazy amber. Fruity and sweet with soft mouthfeel.

Big Time Hopfest;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;(Draft: Big Time Brewery and Alehouse in Seattle, WA) I’ve liked every single-hop beer featuring Simcoe hops I’ve tried, and it continues with this offering. It’s citrusy, grapefruity, but somewhat mild mannered. Lightly sweet pale malts provide a solid yet gentle base for the hops. Grapefruit really takes ahold of the finish. Similar characteristics in the nose, it’s grapefruity and hoppy, with a lightly sweet maltiness. Seems every bit as bitter as their standard IPA. Hazy amber color is darker than the IPA but the off-white head shows the same fade to a ring, and intricate lacing seems limited to the top part of the glass. Nice tasting beer that does a nice job of showcasing the Simcoe hops, but it doesn’t excite my senses.
Big Time Hopfest;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;"Said, ""Simsoe"" hops of the day... unremarkable, try again. Sad but true! And I really love this little bar too."

Ingos Hammer Lager;Halmstad, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Krönleins Bryggeri;[Bottled, rating from 1998] Ingo, that is the former world heavyweight boxing champion Ingemar Johansson, was given the dubious honours to have a beer called after him. As all beer with this kind of trendy marketing most of it’s character is on the outside bottle rather than inside, because this was one of Krönlein’s more boring offerings. It still has a little bit of that freshness that I like with Krönleins though. It poured pale yellow. The body is extremely light (for a heavy weight champion), and had no bite at all.
Three Hearts Julöl Extra Strong;Halmstad, Sweden;Bock - Doppelbock;Krönleins Bryggeri;"Rating from way back. A dark brown/red-coloured beer.

Pike Kilt Lifter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pike Brewing Company;Tap @ Pike Brewing Co, Seattle. Pours a deep amber brown, small pale tan head. Caramel nose. Medium bodied, nice toffee presence, a small amount of sweet malt grain. Good wee heavy.
Pike Kilt Lifter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pike Brewing Company;Draft: Poured a clear burgundy color ale with a medium off-white foamy head with OK retention and light carbonation. Aroma of caramelized malt with light toffee notes is enjoyable. Taste is also a mix of caramelized malt notes, some toffee with some residual sugar notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Not the most complex offering from the style but enjoyable nonetheless.
Pike Kilt Lifter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pike Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery. Dark amber color. Malty, with a slight hint of smoky scotch.
Pike Kilt Lifter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pike Brewing Company;Warm and malty flavour, but lacking something. A bit too sweet and a little too unbalanced for my taste
Pike Kilt Lifter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pike Brewing Company;Hint of musk amd some florals. Amber pour with good head. Light caramel. Light sweet end. Tap at brewery.

Pike Kilt Lifter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pike Brewing Company;Bottle in Seattle. Ring of soft offwhite foam on a darker Ruby amber body. Lightly peaty and fruit forward malt aroma. Medium body with dry red fruit skin and a hint of metallic and peaty malts. Boring but enjoyable enough. Soft mid palate with some malt bitterness by finish. Classical American example of style.
Pike Kilt Lifter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pike Brewing Company;Pours a clear copper brown on tap with thin ring of bubbly off-white head that leaves light lace. Aroma and taste of typical scotch ale, earthy hops, sweet and dark malts, a hint of fruity esters, booze is lighter here. Decent.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;30-Jul-17 (12-oz bottle: Purchased 09-Apr-07 for $5.58 at Liquid Solutions in Tigard, OR) This aged Barley Wine pours a very hazy, amber-brown body, but just a ring of large bubbles because when I popped the cap, there was no carbonation rush. So, yeah, it's pretty close to flat. The nose is earthy and very caramely, with aromas of wort, decayed logs, toffee, and some milk chocolate. On the palate, lots and lots of caramel, but it's not nearly as sweet as expected. Earthy logs, lightly toasted bread, fig, and dried apricot, but the finish is strangely reminiscent of a slightly smoky Pilsener like the famous Urquell. The beer is medium-full in weight, low in carbonation, and because it's not that sweet and there's a touch of earthy acidity, it's not heavy or cloying in the least. Overall, with the exception of the low carbonation due to the twist top, this is very tasty and enjoyable.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;Boozy with lots of caramel. Pours hazy orange with good head and lacing. Bittersweet boiled down with tobacco. Tap at brewery.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;August 8, 2014 - with blankboy, gregclow, jercraigs and mabel. Bomber. Ruby-copper pour, nice creamy tan mottled head. Hoo yeah, US barleywine aroma all right - alcohol, floral/resin bitterness - lots of sweet cereal/gluten grain. Taste follows - strong, malty and big bitterness to match - just the thing (8+). Solid body, chewy, decent carbonation - big mellow bitter/boozy/malty finish ... I would grab this again in a shot.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;Bomber, 2012 vintage. Caramel malt aroma with notes of peaty smoke, dark fruit and grassy and floral hops. Pours cloudy caramel colored with a thin tan head that has little retention or lacing. Starts with caramel malt and dark fruit flavors with peaty smoke notes. Finishes dry with grassy and floral hops as well as light citrus hops. Pretty good barleywine.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;This gets worse as it goes along. Smells nicely of grass and molasses, with a nice similar first flavor. However, it gets sweeter the deeper in the bottle get, which, for a 2-year old bottle isn’t great. Maybe it’ll mellow out even more as it gets older, but I was hoping for a bit more here.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;It pours cloudy medium brown with a tinge of orange and a light brown head. The aroma has plenty of sweet malt with bread and caramel. It also has aroma of plums and floral elements. It also has hints of citrus that is orange like. The malt is predominant with a balance between the esters and hops in the background. The malt flavors are sweet with the hop balance being somewhat aggressive with a moderate alcohol element in the taste. It has bread and caramel malt richness in the flavors with floral hops and citrus that in orange like. There are also hints of plums and the alcohol does has a hint of whiskey element in it as well. It has a chewy body with moderately high alcohol warming that is a slight tinge hot, but not unpleasant. It is somewhat dry and the floral hops and dryness linger on the palate. Overall, this is a malt forward barley wine that is moderately hop aggressive as the beer warms.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;2013 vintage. Nice maltiness, caramel and clove. Was a bit of medicinal taste on first sip. Pretty rounded as you might expect with a three year old barleywine.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;22oz bottle, winter 2015 edition. Hazy dark amber, with a thin but lasting head, and spotty lace. Aroma is malty, caramel, smoke, peat, raisin. Flavor is sweet and malty up front, lots of caramel and dried fruit, a touch of peat, with some citrusy hops on the finish.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Pours a hazed amber brown with a medium sized tan head. Big sticky malt on the nose, sweet and fruity, a hint of isopropyl. Medium bodied, big and malty, rather sticky fruity malt. Slow malt, sticky and sweet. Big plum and prune notes.

Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;Pours a hazy reddish brown. Aromas of hops, caramel malts, kind of medicinal. Flavor is to strong for me, big alcohol taste, malty with a citrus taste.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;Draft at Pike Pub in Seattle, WA. Dark body, small head. Alcohol noticeable for such a light brew. Good deal of hops with some lingering woodiness.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;For those with a zest for dark porters, the Pike Old 89 is a wise choice. Pours a dark amber-brown body with a handsome tan head. Described as a modern version of an old world beers, Old 89 heads out much like an English stout, while coming at you with rich coffee tonus and closing with a particularly malleable, lightsome finish.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;on tap at the brewpub. quite dark with a thin, lasting off-white head. some cocoa powder and whipped cream in the aroma, smooth and drinkable, faint tartness and a little after dinner mint
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;Tap at brewpub. Good nose, choc/coffee/mocha. Little egg or salty too. Classic brown/ black color. Good head that faded. Sweet and bitter flavors, chocolate/ soap/ tinny. Thin bodied, sweet dry finish. Slightly off from a classic porter. Just alright.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;hat this on tap and it was pretty good, I compare it as a tasty version of guniess. It was very creamy with decent lacing, and the taste was very full, very much a decent porter. I will go with this one again if I go back.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;Had it on Tap, was supprised on this rendition of the old classic. My buddy thought it was better than a good Guiness I didn’t agree but still thought it was a damn good nitro brew. I did pick up a bit of ’wateriness’ that was a bit dristracting and the creaminess wasn’t up to par with what I look for in a Guiness style beer. But all in all this is brew can stand w/ the best of what I normally find of tap in Washington.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;Dark brown/ruby, tan light head/lacing. The aroma is chocolaty with some mocha & coffee. Watery, metallic. The flavor is salty with some astringent malts. Very light and too dry.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;Bottle(sample bottling) pours black with brown highlights, nice cream colored frothy head, with clingy lacing.   Roasted malts and a major amount of butter on the nose.   Forwardly butter like with minor roasted malt flavor.   By the middle and through to the finish the flavor falls off the boat and is completely gone after I swallow.   Maybe a light flavor of coffee or dark chocolate on the exit, but VERY light.   Body and mouthfeel are decent, but this is one that I will soon forget.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;Tap@Pike. Sweet caramel and toast, some roasted malt, soft and light. Also noticed odd aromas of sweat and nappies, which made it a bit more interesting.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;This actually surprised the hell out of me. I tend to find nitro beers watered down beyond belief and aching to be gulped...not this one. This was wonderfully balanced between the roasted barley and great chocolate notes. I would be lying if I said this didn't carry with it the nitro characteristic of a less-than-full aroma, but the appearance makes up for it right?
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;Nitro tap@ Pike. Clear golden color with lasting white head. Light apricot, dusty pale malt, wheaty yeasty aromas. Super smooth medium body. Lightly tart wheat flavors with mild clove, banana yeast, and mild earth____smooth easy finish---not bad.
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;"""there were only a couple brews at Pike that i DIDN’T like, but this was the worst of em. A weak ass beer, even for a hefe. a muddled slightly unpleasant aroma atop an unassuming beer in both body and flavor. one to avoid."""
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;Not included in the Sampler, so I ordered a glass after I tried all the rest. It was a good decision as this is a decent Hefeweizen.
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Poured cloudy yellow with a white head. Aroma was lemon. Medium sweetness, no bitterness, and a thin body.
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;this was very wheaty. I had this in my first visit and like the amber weisse better
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;2010-07-05. Crisp dark yellow with a small white head. 3+ Mild aroma is lightly estery, touch of wheat. Flavour is thinner than hoped, fruity esters, tart grainy wheat in the finish lingers in the aftertaste. Average palate. bit dull but okay. On tap at Pike Place brewpub, Seattle
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;Draught at Brewpub, Seattle, WA, USA. Slightly hazy pale golden colour with small white head. Citrus, wheat and spices in aroma. Wheat, sweetish fruits, citrus and some mild hops in flavour. Slightly thin.
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Served with lemon, which took over the nose. Some banana, clove, and ginger in there too. A bland American wheat ale cum weizen. Banana, lemon, and ginger in the mouth. Not very crisp or refreshing. Mediocre.
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;"Tap at the brewpub. I suggest this is more of a wheat beer than a hefe. Eh. Hazy golden amber with a creamy white head. Mild malt/wheat aroma. Medium body; mild carbonation. Flavor is light wheat/malt with a little Belgian yeast/spice. Hints of fruit. Very refreshing. Might be some citrus, but they stuck a lemon on it. So?"

Pike XXXXX Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pike Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery. Opaque with a frothy, tan head. Aroma of chocolate and dark roast coffee. Smooth and creamy.
Pike XXXXX Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pike Brewing Company;65cl bottle at home (27 IV 2019), as Pike XXXXX Stout. Allready shared such a bottle at a beer geeks gathering, now let's have this world class stout a go at a more convenient pace. The black tanned brew with orange-red to even brown gloom - never being sticky, whatsoever - comes with almost no foam. The beer is pitch-black at its core. The nose has a typical dry stout character, with a herbal and even creamy body. Think of black chocolate, of course, but also several hints at cacao, cigar, chocolate ice cream topping. The roasted malts are omnipresent. The mouthfeel is very soft, with just a hidden carbonation at best. The body is a sour, with different bitter chocolate and smoked malt features. Sweetness is unresponsive, which is nice. This continues being a good-old stout, so don't expect an explosion of taste sensations. The warming alcoholic touch is smooth and restrained. Here again, one can just feel those creamy, yeasty dashes. At the end, a caramel feeling drops in - making this a great treat.
Pike XXXXX Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pike Brewing Company;Ingredients: Water, Malt, Hops, and Yeast....Plain and simple. A nice chocolate stout with good hop finish. Balance close to perfect for this style. Similar to the new Guiness Foreign Extra. This is my first sample from Pike and is a nice start. Solid beer that I would try again.
Pike XXXXX Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pike Brewing Company;19-Aug-17 (22-oz bottle: Purchased 14-Mar-07 for $4.30 at Liquid Solutions in Tigard, OR) This Stout pours a black body and a thin, tan head due to lower carbonation from the extended cellaring. The nose is very roasty with lots of licorice, scorched earth, char, molasses, and old wood. On the palate, aged, earthy character and dark-roast dominate, with notes of chocolate, cocoa, some coffee, and molasses. The beer is medium in weight, medium-minus in carbonation, and very smooth on the palate. Overall, despite the long cellaring, this is still a very tasty and enjoyable Stout.
Pike XXXXX Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pike Brewing Company;Roast and dark chocolate. Light caramel but properly subdued. Pours black with good mocha head. Rich and fairly dry. Velvety texture. Bottlr.
Pike XXXXX Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pike Brewing Company;Excellent stout. Lots of bitter chocolates some dried fig and molasses but not too sweet. Typically all the stuff u want in a stout especially if u don’t like the too thick and syrupy type. Liking it more as I sip. Great balance of alcohol and fruit. Sexy beer!
Pike XXXXX Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pike Brewing Company;Proeverij bij de brouwerij in Seattle. Koffie, gebrande mout, flink bitter, licht romig. Ook zoeten. (9-2016).

Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;Somewhat grainey and rather dull, this beer sports a hint of roasted nuttiness, some sweet maltiness, but is overall pretty bland and boring.
Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;Deep brown beer. Very faint aroma. Some light nuttiness over the sweet caramel and a light cocoa note. Flavour is pretty bland and watery though. Light sweetness and a touch of nuttiness. Meh.
Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;clear brown beer with a tan head. dominant choc nose. filed down the throat with ease. pushing mostly malty tones of shakra. mild and easy to drink but not impressive.

Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;on tap at pike. pretty decent brown ale. browny amber, caramel aroma, lightly nutty with a pleasant late saltiness in the finish
Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;Nut Browns tend to be smooth, but this was very much so. Mild malt, not so overwhelmingly flavorful, but loaded with caramel and slightly toasty nuttiness. Not the most palatable brown, with a malt loaded beer like this the palate should be a given, but this was a touch thin. Overall average, although tasty.
Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;Tap at brewpub, ok nose, lite roasty, carmel & chocolate with a touch of orange. Clean orange brown color. No head. Bitter flavors. baker chocolate and touch of orange/ grapefruit came to mind. Thin bodied, bitter dry finish. I like it, though tad hoppy for a brown ale
Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;Amber mahogany with no head & some lacing. The aroma is like musky hop dishwater. The flavor is watery with some thick malt & a finish that really cries out for some hop or alcohol balance.
Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;Tap@Pike. This wasn’t too bad for a brown ale. Not too sweet or sickly, nice nutty malts and not much else, simple, but it tasted OK to me.
Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;"On Tap Pours a bit darker than the Pike Pale Ale but is similar in taste. Floral with a small hop undertone and sweet malt. A slight ""woody"" aftertaste."
Pike Auld Acquaintance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pike Brewing Company;"Glad that I got this on clearance. 2nd sample from this brewer and liking what I am seeing so far. This is one of those simple beers. Description says ""lots of malt"", but the ingredients say ""malted barley, water, hops, yeast ......"" along with the other spices. Balance works well for me and is a nice representation of a winter ale. Does not seem that malty, and like a lighter version of a barleywine...or has that pale ale feel. Will look for this again next season."
Pike Auld Acquaintance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pike Brewing Company;Deep orange. Spice and orange zest with some caramel. Fruity, lightly toasted, medium bitterness. Light citrus tang. Decent.
Pike Auld Acquaintance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pike Brewing Company;Charlie Papazian bottle. Sweet and spicy aroma. Spot on with the winter spices. Nicely balanced by the malt. Would be good with a pumpkin pie. Where’s that pie anyway?!?

Pike Auld Acquaintance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pike Brewing Company;Draught at Collective on Tap, Woodinville, WA Hazy dark amber color. Some caramel, very light biscuity malts, ordinary bitterness, tiny nuttiness in the final. Not much effort, but at least it’s clean.
Pike Auld Acquaintance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pike Brewing Company;From bottle. Dark amber color. Aroma is light spice, citrus, and caramel malt. Taste is similar, with some coriander and slight bitterness. Lingering spice.
Pike Auld Acquaintance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pike Brewing Company;22oz bomber, this is the 3rd time I am buying this beer just to rate it. And you know I really want to rate it because its not a very positive review. Dark orange amber color. Head fades quickly. Aroma is sweet fruity and toasty. Nothing about that is fun or good. There are some poor spices, just a mix of bad stuff.
Black Horse Premium Lager;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pints out of the bottle at Harbour View Restaurant. Soaking wet cold and miserable with 4 hours before the ferry leaves Port Au Basques. Clear yellow lightly sweet and a bit grainy, cold and crisp. Its a macro lager, not anything you wouldn't expect cleanly made. The first one went down in record time as I slowly returned to somewhat normal. The next two paired well with the Greco pizza I savored before heading getting on the ship to head back home.
Black Horse Premium Lager;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottled. Clear yellow body with small white head. The taste is mellow and yeasty and there almost no finish.

Pours a light, clear straw with a large, light, white head. Aromas are too faint when cold. Tastes are standard macro lager (light grain, corn) with only a subtle hint of hops. Light body, crisp, fairly assertive carbonation and a medium grain finish. Inoffensive and easy drinking but not interesting. ---Rated via Beer Buddy

Black Horse Premium Lager;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle at Kwang Tung, Fogo Island’s only Chinese restaurant, and apparently the most northern Chinese restaurant in Canada (as told to me by someone in St.John’s).

Black Horse Premium Lager;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);On tap at the Fo’c’sle. Pours a clear golden colour with white head with decent retention. Aroma is hard to detect besides bland graininess. Flavour also has weak granny notes with some wet straw. Finish? What finish. No seriously off notes, but an incredibly forgettable beer.

Served in a stout glass, dark brown color with dark tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, some coffee with a slightly earthy note. Taste was malty roast, some chocolate and dark fruit with very light hop note. Medium body, average carbonation, slightly creamy with sweet roast finish. Overall quite tasty, a lighter body but still full of flavor. Nice drinking over the downtown streets of the oldest city.

Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Aroma and flavor is dark malts, thin in the middle and a mix of chocolate and and slight acidity in the finish.
Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"""a weak lighter ale blended with a weak dark ale. not revolting, but i had it on tap with a pizza and beyond the crispness and tiny bit of malt, there’s nothing there..."""
Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);12 oz bottle, pours black with a tan head. Malty aroma but not really much more then that.
Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);body that is dense with soft carbonation like a parfait. bit of chocolate and gravy master flavor that is sweet and with cereal grains. finish lightens on the body and lingering flavor of sweetness and barley. it is good on a hot day and would probably be good in certain situations.
Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Anheuser-Busch, Inc.--Michelob Specialty Brewing Group--Black and Tan--1998 12 oz. Bottle. 5.00% ABV. (3.25 / 5.0) Very dark and black. Light chocolate flavor in medium light body. Very clean finish.
Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);This is inferior in all ways to any black and tan that you could possibly concoct on your own. Too sweet and watery by half for my tastes. More lager than Porter.
Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Bottle. Found some old notes. somewhat of a muddy brown in color, next to flat pour. It had somewhat of a roasted coffee aroma. Tasting revealed somewhat of a bitter lager porter mix. It had a watery body, and somewhat of an oily character. Not very good.
Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Bottle Poured a dark brown. Had aroma of grain and bubbles. Did not taste like a mix but rather a weak bock. Not awful but its gone now anyway.
Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Bottle poured like a dark lager. Aroma was of roasted malt. Flavor was burnt malt and very light on the tongue.
Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I want to say this was the precursor to Amber bock, but this is terrible. No separation between the dark and the light, just an amberish dark brown color. Light and grainy and not quite horrid, but close.
McSorleys Black and Tan;Los Angeles, California, United States;Stout;Pabst Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Deep reddish brown color. Bubbly tan head. Sweet malty nose. Light chocolate malt flavor.
McSorleys Black and Tan;Los Angeles, California, United States;Stout;Pabst Brewing Company;Tap. Dark pour with mocha head. Slight dark roast, nuts, toffee flavor. Easy to drink. Not bad, especially at a bar like this
Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;12oz bottle share in 2013. Deep brown with a tan head. Aroma of raisins, prunes, dates, dark malt and caramel. Fantastic mouthfeel in the beer. So much wonderful dried fruit and Christmas pudding flavour. Not too sweet, though. Such a shame you don’t see Dogfishhead in the UK anymore.
Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;2008 bottle reviewed on 4/5/19. Dark brown pour with a short-lived khaki head. German alt or maibock pruny esters on the nose. Prune and brown sugar flavors.
Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;2009 bottle, at a tasting in 2018. Hazy reddish amber with very small frothy beige head, woodsy sweet rum aroma, low carbonation, very boozy sweet taste, thin body, long finish. This is like drinking pure spirits!
Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;From May 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! The pour reveals a clear reddish amber liquid with a 2 finger head of foam and plenty of lacing. Very good head retention. The smell has notes of wood, bubblegum, candy sugar, and a fruitiness. The taste is....different. I get a musky flavour mixed with some caramel malt, along with bubblegum, some candy sugar, but, I can't get over the muskiness, if that is the proper way to describe it. Whole lot of alcohol going on in the taste as well, and too much warming for the abv, imho. I'm drinking this at near room temperature and maybe that isn't the way to go but under these conditions, it's not working for me at all. The body is definitely on the watery side for me.. I'm glad I got to try this brew but it just doesn't do it for me, unlike the majority of DFH's brews. 1 bottle is more than enough and I wouldn't seek this out again, for sure. To me, the flavours are a mess.
Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;May 28, 2017. Flight selection at DFH brewpub in Rehoboth. Outstanding Belgian strong...smoky, oak flavor...long caramel, sugary finish. Will be looking for this in the future.
Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;Originally rated on 1/2/2009.A nice deep brown with a slight reddish tint body, off white head that left plenty of lace. Flavor was a disappointment with mostly a metallic presence that dominated the other flavors. I guess this was a bad bottle, maybe i might try it again someday.
Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;Dark clear, brown / reddish pour with thick beige foam. Full body with less fizz and a thick, sweet finish. Dried fruit in the nose and caramel, nutty malts, burnt sugar. Some light bitterness, but this is all about the malt mingling with the fruit. The finish has a little yeast and alcohol. A strong, complex approach to a Belgian that would compliment a range of flavorful foods.

Dogfish Head Chicory Stout;Milton, Delaware, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours black with a one finger, tan head. Aroma is molasses, coffee, wood and light licorice. Taste is brown sugar, moving to coffee, roast, licorice and wood. Finish is wood and coffee. A good stout.
Dogfish Head Chicory Stout;Milton, Delaware, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dogfish Head Brewery;Had on April 3, 2019 from a bottle from 2007. Pours a very dark brown with a quickly evaporating khaki colored head. Sorghum and chicory on the nose. Moderately thick male feel. Drinks more dryly than the nose would suggest. Chicory earthiness and bitterness dominates the sorghum flavors.
Dogfish Head Chicory Stout;Milton, Delaware, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dogfish Head Brewery;From Aug 2007 I got this one in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks, John! Pours from 12oz bottle a very dark brown with reddish hues and a small but tight head of foam that shrinks to some islands and it has some good sticky lacing. The smell is of sweet malt, roasted malt, vanilla and wood. The taste is of caramel and roasted malt, some vanilla and woody notes. Further sips give me a bit of chocolate and a wee bit of fruit and sharp bitterness just before the finish and the finish itself is semi sweet. This is a good taster and easy to drink and it has a smooth mouthfeel and the carbo is light. All in all, a solid American Stout that should please most palates.
Dogfish Head Chicory Stout;Milton, Delaware, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dogfish Head Brewery;Backlog, bottle from Canals West Deptford. pours a dark brown color with a medium head and plenty of lasting lace on my glass. Notes of coffee, smoke, licorice, crystal malt, oat, and pine. Some more smoked cherry wood as it opens up. Not bad
Dogfish Head Chicory Stout;Milton, Delaware, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dogfish Head Brewery;12oz bottle. I just had to rate a DFH beer after all the anger about AB this week. Pours out dark brown almost black topped with a tan head. Nose is light chocolate some roast malts and a little hop bitterness. Taste is more like sadness as you can see my shity same old reviews are still mine and not a AB robot. Sure hope this blows over at some point but I am sure the scares are deep.
Dogfish Head Chicory Stout;Milton, Delaware, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dogfish Head Brewery;Sampled at Epcot Food & Wine Festival 2016.

Dogfish Head Chicory Stout;Milton, Delaware, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dogfish Head Brewery;Rated from old notes. A workmanlike stout, rich, hints of chocolate and licorice. Served too cold at the time so some of the flavors were probably dulled. Definite candidate to re-rate.

Rodenbach Grand Cru;Roeselare, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Rodenbach (Swinkels Family Brewers);Really sour:)) teasty, but actually seems to me very simple, tastes like black bread, Russian “Kvas” like. Red Ale from Rodenbach much-much better:)
Rodenbach Grand Cru;Roeselare, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Rodenbach (Swinkels Family Brewers);Brunröd i färgen med smutsvitt lätt skum. Softar fruktigt och syrligt av surkörsbär.

Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Nitro Keg at the Storehouse, Amble. Pours clear golden amber with a thin white head. Aromas of light malt, little else. Taste is sweet and thin. Disappears to nothing.
Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);On tap at a hotel outside Mansfield. Pale Amber colour with a tick cream head. Very slight floral aroma, but dead other than that. Taste was quite sweet. Very poor.
Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);On keg at Matlock Town FC - Thought I’d had this, a very familiar feel to it. Typically good looking nitrokeg look, amber body, solid white head. Nose is a sweet caramel, a bit of malt and the taste has a similar feel too. Nitro helps this have a good mouthfeel, smooth and creamy. Very refreshing for its style.
Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Golden pale ale with a creamy head. Its aroma is light and and the tropical fruit flavours are mild in taste.
Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Two pints poured into UK pint sleeves at the Wellington cricket club bar on Sunday 9 Oct 2011 during a Christening party. Bright semi-dark amber body with a creamy foaming topping. This beer is cold when it comes out, it is also creamy, the nitrogen sees to both the temp and creaminess. No smell and the whole deal is weak, with only a slight bitterness in the taste. OK for none cask bitter men maybe, but not for me.
Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Keg at the Dudley Sports & Social Club. Pours orange with a medium head. Aroma is some orange and bready malt. Taste had a hint of orange and watery bready malt. Got better as it warmed.

Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);On keg in a Burtonwood pub in Yorkshire - can’t remember where or when (old notes). Ventured into a Burtonwood pub because W & D bought the pub group and the days of finding Burtonwood beers in pubs bearing their name may be numbered. Unfortunately only W & D beers were on offer. So I took the tick rather than drink a Banks’s beer I’d had before. Amber colour. Certainly smooth and creamy. Unfirtunately its entirely devoid of flavour. Except a rather metallic aftertaste. It could hardly be called horrible - it doesn’t have enough character for that - but I surely won’t be seeking this one out again.
Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Keg at The Pepperpot, Banbury. Orange amber with masses of nitrogen, white head. Crikey Ratebeer has messed my drinking habits up, there was a perfectly acceptable Pedigree to be had, but I opted for this. Cardboard notes to the fore with a flat malt taste. The creaminess comes from a thick primeivel soup of nitrogen awaiting to be released from the freezing liqued. Me not like.
Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);June, 2005. The Magna Carta, Lincoln. Keg. Creamy apple tinged beer - slightly tinny. Drinkable.
Mansfield Original Bitter;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Keg pint on 23 April 2016 in The Countryman, Ingoldmells Lincolnshire. Not seen this beer for years, so thought I would have one for old times sake. Golden syrup coloured with a good, steady white head. Decent blend of malt and hops with a slight sweetness overall, ideal lunchtime throwing beer. No huge flavours or aroma, just a Cooking Bitter.
Mansfield Original Bitter;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);On tap at a hotel outside Mansfield. Amber colour with a tick cream head. Metalic aroma, but dead other than that. Taste was quite sweet. Very poor excuse for a bitter.

Mansfield Original Bitter;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);500ml can at 3.6%. Pours orange brown with a medium head. Aroma is fruity Ribena malt and a little dust. Taste is like drinking Ribena, dark berries. A little cocoa. Better then expected.

Mansfield Original Bitter;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Can from my local offy. Miserable fucking bitch in The Last Oasis, Macclesfield. I boycotted her right after this the nosy fat cow. Clear amber gold with thick soapy white head. Just like her. Dripping in shite gold, thick fat swede on her. I might have to rate it again in case her evilness seeped into the can. I doubt it. Low carbonation, malty, tea. Don’t like it. Never buy from that evil donkey faced old fish wife again.
Mansfield Original Bitter;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Nice smooth session bitter - good colour, nice head, fruity, nice malt but not overpowering. Hop aroma and finish. Very drinkable, sadly hard to get in these parts (West Yorkshire) - Inexplicably I picked up 20 cans of these in my local Morrisons as a split case yet they don’t appear to sell it unfortunately.
Mansfield Original Bitter;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);"Can, Co-Op, Bracknell. Slightly cloudy amber colour with an off-white head; malty aroma and taste and a little bitterness at the end. Nothing exceptional."
Mansfield Original Bitter;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Can, Sainsbury’s, Kidlington, 31-10-06. Mmmhh difficult to think of many positives about this, I only picked it up because it had been split from a multipack and was cheap. Amber coloured with white creamy head, bit sweet some malt but all in all as expected quite disappointing.

Mansfield Dark Smooth Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);18th July 2015: keg pint at The Robin Hood just outside Baslow, Derbyshire. Dark, deep brown with a red hue the head a thick creamy affair. Served very cold, so no smell for at least 5 minutes. Roasted/toasted malt aroma once it was allowed to have one, I already knew it would have a promise of a mini sweetness to come in the taste, which it did. The taste was dominated by the malts and as it’s name suggests it was smooth in nature. Not really a keg bitter man but this was a whole lot better than the pint of cask Pedigree I had before it in the pub.
Mansfield Dark Smooth Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);On tap at a hotel outside Mansfield. Deep brown colour colour with a tick cream head. Roasted malt aroma, but rather dull. Taste slightly sweet, but a touch of bitterness at the finish.

Mansfield Dark Smooth Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);"A Mes rate: Ok I have to describe this scene. Sim and I were driving to my brothers house in deepest darkest Macclesfield. It’s lashing down with rain and we are both busting for the loo. Eventually we can go no further, pull up the car and run over the road getting soaked into the nearest pub. Before I knew it I was in the gents and Sim had disappeared down a corridor hopefully to find the ladies. All of a sudden it occurs to me that we have just run through the pub not saying anything and the place was TOTALLY empty and the only three people in there had given us such a stare when we ran in. So being the good chap that I am I decide to buy a beer (don’t be cheeky and not use the toilet without buying anything, small pub struggling for business etc....) I’m done before Sim so I go straight to the bar and order a swift one of this as I have never seen it before. The well poured and conditioned beer was on the bar straight away and there I am, on my own with the three people who were now at the bar. Oh one of them is the landlord behind the bar by the way. Sim returns from the loo and we sat there and shared the beer and rate it infront of them into my phone. They honestly barely spoke and if they did it was just grunting. Instead they spent their whole time looking at us and my phone. If you have ever seen ""Withnail and I"" (and if you havent, you should) it was just like the pub near the cottage where the poacher comes in and serves himself at the end of the night. We left and stoped just around the corner to pick up a chinese meal from what was the exact take away equivalent of the watering house up the street. Imagine how pleased I was to get home and find out the beer was retired and the last rating was well over two years ago. The beer was decent but what do you care, you can’t get it anymore. Long rate very sorry."

Cask, handpump dispense. Clear copper in colour with a thick white head. Slight hint of sweet caramel in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a digestive biscuit base with soft caramel notes present. Slight metallic tang to the not too dry bitter aftertaste. Finish is slightly malty but weak in the mouth.

Nelson Hardy's Kiss;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;(cask @ The Coopers Arms , Rochester) A rich -malty sweet dark ale , that had some ’Old Ale’ character and tendancies . The ale drank down with notes of caramel and what felt like chcolate malt had been used. A little winey , fruity and bloody like old peculier or something. The palate , while treacly , did offer some late light musty dryness. Full bodied ale that feels more boozy than 4% . Drinkable and somehow comforting
Nelson Hardy's Kiss;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask handpull at Simple Simons, Canterbury. Amber with lasting beige head. Yeasty, malty, fruity best bitter. Not sure all the parts go together well. All fighting with each other. Fine, but not as good as the Rochester Bitter.
Nelson Hardy's Kiss;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Dark tan color and low tight head from the cask. Light toasted malt with some sugary sweetness. Reserved hopping and tinge of bitterness at the very end. Thinish and rather uniteresting.
Nelson Hardy's Kiss;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Red mahagony color. Little foamy head. Light bitter taste with sweet intervalls. Nice but nothing special.
Nelson Hardy's Kiss;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Good solid beer this, the very first at the Lock last Friday. Lovely amber coloured body with as white head. Hoppy with moderate bitterness, the malts play a secondary role in what is best described as a full classic bitter. Initially there was some confusion, SilkT et al, thought that this beer was Harvey’s – Kiss Ale but my notes didn’t say that. Committed as I am to rating quality, I returned to the Wenlock on the Saturday to double check with Dave. Flagship (Nelson Brewery) is what it was. Just to make doubly sure of everything I fronted up on the Sunday as well…..to find the absolute gem, Adnams Oyster Stout, just out of retirement. Wow!!
Nelson Hardy's Kiss;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;April, 2003: Three Daws, Gravesend. Sweet malt dominates - a mollases taste which coats the roof of your mouth. Hops are in the background. [2.4] March, 2004: The Rising Sun, Kemsing. Badged as Hardy’s Kiss. Amber bitter. Fresh on, but a bit cloudy. Fruity notes with just enough bittering hops to provide a neutral palate. A restrained and undeveloped beer that somehow manages to produce some oaky character, plus some brown sugar and watery caramel flavours. Undeveloped malt aroma. Nelson’s yeast seems a slow acting yeast which does not fully attenuate resulting in an interesting oaked malt quality which sadly does not quite suit my palate. [2.1 Feb, 2005: Three Daws, Gravesend. Light orange flavours. Drier and more gulpable than on previous samples. Enjoyable. [2.7]

Nelson Futtock;Chatham, Kent, England;Strong Ale - English;Nelson Brewing Co.;White Cliffs Winter Ales Fest. Gravity. Lovely colour - a deep scarlet. Smooth and flavoursome but lacking in real impact. Nice balance, but it then wanders between watery and gritty. Everything fades quickly. Vintage ale aroma.

Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"Bottle. Very smooth, malty lager. Definitely sweet. Clean finish. Very well finished with no off-flavors. Many of the current IPA microbeers have a punchy, hoppy hook. They create a ""wow"" at the tasting, but they quickly fatigue the palate, and are ultimately not a drinking beer. This one is the opposite: unassuming at first, but so smooth and drinkable. Extremely well finished, and one of my new favorites!"
Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Mild hops with a nice balancing bready malt. A little malty sweetness. A lot of flavor for a lager.
Nelson Crows Nest;Chatham, Kent, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nelson Brewing Co.;Golden and still in appearance. Aromas are fruity pear and floral. Flavours are pears, apples with dry hops. Not very biiter on the finish. Just reasonable.
Nelson Crows Nest;Chatham, Kent, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask Conditioned, at The Frog & Todd, Gillingham. Bright as can be, golden honey colour, charming. Strong volatile aroma, that dominates the entire experience. Alcohol, perhaps paint thinner, permeates this beer. A fight with one of the looks was narrowly avoided as I quickly explained we were not beer wankers but just two guys doing our job, sure I said ‘you can make a living our of drinking beer, but some days it just hard work’ the guy loved us from that point on. The second funny thing was that the brewer walked in whilst we were drinking this, Silk quickly collars him about the poor quality, that was a mistake….I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone say so much which meant so little, including some of the greatest politicians. Part of the life threatening SilkTork Gillingham Magical Mystery Tour.
Nelson Crows Nest;Chatham, Kent, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask Conditioned at The Hobgoblin, Oxford. Limpid gold colour with little head. Citric hoppy beer with an orange like background. Little conditioning and a little flat.
Nelson Crows Nest;Chatham, Kent, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nelson Brewing Co.;May, 2003: Gravity, Rochester Beer Festival. Gee, getting quite a skinful now. Time for something to eat. Anyway - pale gold colour. Citric cidery flavour with the citric tang progressing well into the finish. Somewhat watery and lacking the distinctive fresh bite of a typical Golden Ale. [1.9] April, 2004: Frog & Toad, Gillingham. Orange-gold possibly premium bitter. Served slightly warm. Pale malt aroma. Fruit with a late hop bite. Chrissie finished this. Good girl. [1.9]

Great Lakes Holy Moses White Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On tap at The Old Town Pour House in Oak Brook, IL., dispensed to a tulip displaying a hazed, golden color, a persistent finger's width of soft white froth, with wavy spots & strands of lacing. The nose needed a bit of warming to expose soft grain/wheat, light fruitiness as lemon, pit variety, and orange peel, with subtle spice, mainly coriander. Light to medium bodied, with lively carbonation, the taste was similar notes, with some tartness & tanginess, a touch of earthy & rind-like bitterness, and dryness to the finish. Not too spiced or sweet. A decent style representation.
Great Lakes Holy Moses White Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Twelve .ounce draft at The Original Hot Dog Shop in Oakland, Pittsburgh.

There's almost nothing to smell. Aroma is faint and wheaty. Flavor is dominated by coriander, over a base of floral hops. Taste is slightly bitter. Body is light to medium with average carbonation. A decent witbier, but not one I'll seek out again. This is the only Great Lakes brew that has disappointed me.
Nelson Spanker;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Sampled at the red cow, Sandwich. No head and a clear brown color. Small aroma of an ocean beach with sea weed. Light acidic ( lactic) taste that over powers malt and hops. Medium body and a low bitterness.
Nelson Spanker;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;"July 2017 - Cask handpull at The Crosse Keys London on a warm day in London after crushing my new iPhone under weights at the gym. As ’Nelson Spanker’, 4.2%. Dark amber brown with an orange hue, still with a very small ring of head. Aroma is light bready malt and apple peel. Smells a bit dodgy. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is watery with some Brighton rock sweetness, ""candy cane"", light red apple, very light malt, minerally, subtle floral hops. Not much to it but it’s a subtle old school bitter in good condition with malt, water, yeast and hop nuance all in tandem. The flavour is actually pretty good, well balanced. Could drink a few pints of it. (5-4-7-3-14=3.3)"

Nelson Spanker;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;1/2 pint cask, Cloisters. Deep reddish golden colour and a creamy medium-sized off-white head that seems like it wants to disintegrate. Nutty rich malty aroma without being sweet. Prickly toffee-like malty flavour with a crisp minty bite. Mouthfeel is slightly acidic with a crisp hop bitterness. Interesting use of malts. It is quite unlike the other cask ales I’ve had the last few days. Smooth texture. I suspect there to be some oxisation introduced during the brewing process.
Nelson Spanker;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask at The Wenlock Arms, London. Copper-coloured with no head. Fruity aroma. Flavour has some fruitiness and caramel with a bitter finish.
Nelson Spanker;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Pub/cask. There’s something not quite right about this beer. Not that it is in bad condition - just that it don’t seem all that well brewed. The malt tatses as though it could do with some better brewing or better quality. And the hops just don’t do it right. I mean, there’s nothing downright offensive about it - it is pleasant enough and quite drinakable, and my companion enjoyed it. It’s just a beer that aint gonna win awards.
Nelson Spanker;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask conditioned at The Rose & Crown, Charlbury. Reddish amber wiith little head. Thinnish malty beer with a rustic unfinished note about it. Some vegetable leaf flavour and a tobacco background.
Nelson Spanker;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask@Catford beer Festival. OK i suppose, a bit thin and grainy, lemony hops, dry mouthfeel, uncomplicated, thin.
Nelson Spanker;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;I can’t say I’ve been too impressed with many of the Nelson beers, which are generally exactly the same as those from the defunct Flagship brewery which preceded it. This is a dark amber beer dominated throughout by undeveloped ruddy malt, with not enough fruit or bitterness to compensate. Consequently, I found it a bit unbalanced. Acceptable, but not great. Cask (gravity), Catford Beer Festival.
Great Lakes Cleveland Brown Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a milky brown color with a finger’s worth of eggshell white foamy head that dissipated at a mild pace. Slight lace. The aroma had some roasted nuts, some caramel/toffee malts, light brown sugar. Ends with some earthy hoppy smells. The flavor was sweet with a touch of bitter and allowing the earthy hoppiness to round it out fairly nice. Aftertaste had some of the nuts, somewhat sweet and a mild roast. Light nutty finish. The feel was almost medium bodied, but sat just a tad under. Carbonation felt fine. Pretty smooth all around. Overall, nice brown ale worthy of coming back to if I could get it again.
Great Lakes Cleveland Brown Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Transfer from BA review on 12-28-12- Poured from growler into a pint glass Appearance – As suggested by the name of the brew the beer pours a medium brown color with a small tan head. The head fades relatively quickly to leave a light level of lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is of roasted malt, sweet smells of caramel and brown sugar as well as some notes of a nutty smell. Mixed with these aromas are some light earthy hop smells which help to round out the malty and sweet smells nicely. Taste – The taste starts out with a mix of sweet and some bitter. An earthy hop taste mixed with a caramel malt taste is strongest up front. The hop flavors dwindle some toward the middle with roasted malt flavors increasing in intensity. Some nutty flavors soon join the profile along with a slight increase in the sweet brown sugar and caramel tastes. In the end the hop flavors come back with a lighter bitter earthy hop flavor, leaving a still overall sweet, lightly bittered, and roasted flavor at the end. Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is rather average in terms of its creaminess. The carbonation level is rather average as well, overall creating a very easy drinking brew. Overall – A fairly sweet, but overall rather well balanced and smooth brown ale. It has nice flavors and transitions making it quite a nice brew to drink.

Hop Back GFB (Gilberts First Brew);Downton, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hop Back Brewery;Hand-pulled pint in the lovely old tourist pub ’Haunch of Venison’, Salisbury, on 12th Oct 2013. This comes a real pale golden colour, almost Lager-like and with the same white head s you’d expect on a Lager/Pilsner. The aroma was both ’grainy’ and hoppy in about equal measures, the hops just winning in the taste stakes with a mild citrus hint coming through. Dry finish to a pretty average brew that was almost boring and lacking any robustness of flavour or body depth. Subtle for some, bland for me.

Bottles are gluten free (and have been for several years - earliest mention I can find is 2014). Appearance is a clear pale straw with a thin persistent white head and light visible carbonation. Badly poured by me (forgot it was bottle conditioned) so quite a lot of very visible sediment, but didn't reflect this in the score. Aroma is bland. Some grain, a little malt, but not much else. Similar to a bland lager was my first thought. Taste is similar. Very little hop, bit of grain, too sweet at the end. Palate is very meh. Light bodied, no carbonation in the mouth, little oily. Short finish as well. Overall, dull. Not really unpleasant, but nothing I'd ever bother having again (in the bottle - cask may be better as it is gluten free). More like a pale lager than anything else, and not a particularly interesting one.

Hop Back Crop Circle;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;0.5l bottle. A crystal clear looking one with a pale golden color and a huge really lacing and lasting bright white head. It smells kinda skunks and slightly sun damages in the aroma. Grainy also. A tad harsh with wet dog and some vegetables. It’s not super unpleasant but definitely not a gentle or elegant aroma. aroma. Tastes a bit better. Easy to drink with a good amount of hop bitterness. Thin oily in the mouth and it has a below average small bubbled carbonation level. Something dry-ish also here. Soft melon and mild citrus. Was not happy with the aroma but it tastes quite decent for what it actually is. 05.07.2014
Hop Back Entire Stout;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Stout;Hop Back Brewery;Cask at Waters Green Tavern, Macclesfield The nose is a peculiar mixture of bacon and chocolate. Pours a very dark brown with a small beige head and soft carbonation. In the mouth there is chocolate and coffee but also fruity hints like black cherries. The dark fruits predominate in the finish, but there is also a sharpness not previously apparent. Quite nice.
Hop Back Entire Stout;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Stout;Hop Back Brewery;25-Feb-12 (500-ml bottle) This stout pours very dark-brown in color with some deep mahogany at the edges, and half an inch of dark-tan head that fizzes away noisily and quickly to a thin sheet. On the palate, it's moderately roasty, with lots of cola flavor, plus dark chocolate, cocoa, some licorice, very gentle ashtray, oatmeal, dark bread, and medium-dark toast. Sweetness is light-to-medium and bitterness is pretty easy going, but there is a slight tartness that seems to detract from any possible richness the stout might have. Weight seems a bit thin too, perhaps medium in body, carbonation is medium-high and prickly, and the mouthfeel is somewhat dry in the finish. The nose is mostly cola, licorice, and dark chocolate, with a light yeastiness in the background. Not bad, not great, just an easy drinking stout.
Hop Back Entire Stout;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Stout;Hop Back Brewery;Best thing about this beer was it's appearance, which is very dark/near black. Has a good frothy mocha head caused by the high carbonation. I found it overly carbonated, had that champagne feel to it. The flavor is decent but nothing special....mainly roasted chocolate malts and coffee. Reminded more of a black lager though over the stouts that I enjoy best. This was another imported beer that I recently bought that didn't quite seem worth the price tag.
Hop Back Entire Stout;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Stout;Hop Back Brewery;Cask @ Cloisters. Very cask/UK style (surprise), old leather, paper thin body (although a slightly creamy mf somehow), low head, a somewhat incongruous bitter aftertaste, earthy. Not 4 me.

An ok Golden Ale.

Thin white head which quickly dissipates. Aroma of lemon, citrus, grass and malts. Taste is quite pleasant, with the bready biscuity malts balanced well with a lemon/citrus zest.

The looks of the beer are very nice. The beer has a nice copper colour, with some touches of nice caramel. The beer is crystal clear and bubbles nicely. On top there is a nice layer of frothy off-white foam. Foam retention is very good. A nice drape stays on top of the beer for quite some time. Nothing wrong with this. I like it. The aroma of the beer is also very nice. It is different from what I'd expect. The malts are delicious. They give the beer toast, roast, a hint of chocolate and some coffee. Nice smooth roasted bouquet. The hops are nice. Earthy and leaflike. They give the beer a nice touch, that goes well with the malts. Yeast gives a creamy fruity aroma, with a touch of banana. It is quite nice. The taste of the beer is also quite nice. The malts give the beer some very nice sweets, but also toasty bitters and roasty salty notes. The hops give more bitterness. For a bitter, it isn't that bitter. Well balanced though. The creamy yeast note makes it extra smooth and balanced. The palate of the beer is also nice. Smooth beer, medium body and medium carbonation. The finish is nice. It has some nice bitter roast, followed by the bitterness of the hops. This hop bitterness in the finish is clearly a Bitter feature, really nice. All in all, a very nice beer."

Milton Jupiter;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Milton Brewery;This used to be my regular drink at the St. Radegund (Cambridge) before it was sadly taken off in early 2007.

It does seem to be tricky to keep, probably due to the low APV. Probably most easily found at the Oakdale Arms (Harringay, London) or Coalheavers (Peterborough)?

New Belgium 1554 Enlightened Dark Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I was surprised to find that this is a lager. It has the appearance of a stout ale, but with a milder flavor. It appears a very dark brown in the glass with a minimal head. Mild flavor and mild aroma. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Bready malt up front, which turns into caramel and roasted dark chocolate. The finish lingers with sweetness of caramel and cocoa. Clean flavors throughout and very even keeled with no spikes of hops, acidity, or fruitiness. Drinks like a 4.5 %abv brew, but it is slightly sneaky at 6%. Has a bit of a creamy mouthfeel, a little more creaminess than other shwarzbeers I've had. Roasted barley bitterness in the finish as well.

Guinness Draught;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Gekocht bij de lokale Albert Heijn en gedronken in een BeerBattle tegen de 7 Deugden Stout + Moedig. Voor mij kwam de Guinness als winnaar uit de bus. Ik heb geen idee of onder invloed van de 'nitro-can' is, maar alleen het inschenken al is bijzonder. Het settlen van het bier is alleen al iets om naar te blijven kijken. De licht creme schuimkraag is niet fors, maar blijft komen met een donkerrode glinstering in het ogenschijnlijke zwarte bier. In de geur springen er voor mij vooral de gebrande mouten uit. De smaak is niet erg uitgesproken. Mogelijk ook vanwege het bijna ontbreken aan koolzuur. Maar, het moet gezegd worden, je drinkt dit bier bijna meer voor de beleving dan voor de smaak
Guinness Draught;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Why am I only rating this now? Creamy, thick, dense head on top of a opaque Brown body. It smells of molasses, with a touch of coffee. It tastes watery, due to the lack of carbonation. It has good flavors, with a bit of the dry aftertaste. I like it better than I like the extra draft. I don't dislike this beer but I couldn't see drinking it all night long. After one or two I'd want to switch to something else

City LaCrosse Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can, shared by me... in my dining room... just now. Pours a pale straw color with a big but quickly falling head. The aroma is doughy, lightly sweet, a little corny, but mild & not uninviting. The flavor is lightly sweet and lightly bitter. It’s got the corniness well in check with a light hop zip. It’s doughy but not over sweet or especially yeasty. The palate is lively and light. In many ways this is a quintessential American Pale Lager, for what it’s worth most folks will not like it because of that, but I do like it. I don’t get enough chances to pick this one up.
City LaCrosse Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Pretty basic lager alcohol taste nothing stands out. Slightly watery. Not bad just not very good.

City LaCrosse Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"12 oz can into 16 oz. snifter (yeah, I know, a snifter is overkill for a lawnmower beer). Light, slight grain/corn aroma. Pours perfectly clear, golden, with reasonable head. Flavor of malt and corn; minimal hops. Not as thin as other lawnmower beers. Pretty good for a beer that comes in 30-pack cans."
City LaCrosse Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Well LaCrosse used to be the home of Blatz and for that I salute them. For this I give them the FINGER! Who poured sugar and corn syrup into my beer!??? I thought I was drinking a corn flavored soda. NEVER AGAIN. NEVER. Hang tight with the Blatz and the bitches will be pounding down your door. Hang with this and expect a lot of digital oscillation (from yourself) of your male member. Shameful! Is this the treatment our boys in uniform deserve?
City LaCrosse Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);A pour man’s MDG or Bud. I’m not a huge fan of lagers in general, but I found this to be skunky which is a bit odd as I had it poured from a can into a pint glass.

Smiles Best;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Cask 3 Judges.

Its the same strength and have a similar description so I’m pretty sure its the same beer. That is farking annoying. Speakof of annoying, this is the kind of english beerr I don’t like: over the top fruity. The aroma and flavor are dominated by plumbs, raisin, pear, toffee, and caramel. You can’t even taste bit of hops. Its a flat, reddish brown with little head. This beer does nothing for me. Maybe if it were hand pumped in England or something."

Smiles Maiden Leg Over;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Smiles;Cask at Comptons. Drinkable, and I had three, but two notable flaws.

Smiles May Fly;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Smiles;Cask Conditioned, at Hamilton Hall, London. Clear golden amber colour with a white head. Vanilla aroma and flavour. Supposed to be a delicate balance of malts but it’s a bit of slop really. Is all a bit washed out with no backbone.
Smiles May Fly;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Smiles;Gravity at the Briar Rose (JDW), Birmingham. Gold beer, no head. The absolute epitome of what Silk Tork speaks about as the freshness of British real ale. No fizz, no head. Just a zesty, lustrous quality in the mouth, ensconced by a subtlety of jostling flavours in the undercurrent. Fruity, hoppy, light, with a dryish, but friendly finish.

Smiles Holly Hops;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Smiles;Cask pint: drank in the Brier Rose, Wetherspoons pub in Birmingham, on winters evening early 2007. Dark with an off white head, looked an OK winter warmer. Burnt malts, mushrooms and biscuits dominate the aroma.

Well it has come out of retirement thanks to Highgate. Red/chestnut colour with thin beige head. Tarry fruit with good malts. Fruit is a little sour in the mouth with dark cherries. Again, I quite like this, bit of liquorice hiding in that sourness somewhere too.
Smiles Holly Hops;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Smiles;"Cask at Royal Oak, Ockbrook. The Boxing Day pint; good chewy stuff to go with the hot pork rolls, hops struggled against the sweetness but managed to give it an overall feeling of control."
Smiles Holly Hops;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Smiles;"Deep reddish brown colour. This year, I seem to hitting a lot of ""Christmas"" beers that are perfectly decent but, frankly, not very Christmassy. At least, not in the way I anticipated. This one was no exception. More like a strong autumnal bitter really. There’s a significant element of dry, chewy malt with quite a noticeable hop rush coming through on the palate. Can’t say I noticed the wheat. Cask (handpump), Penderels Oak (JDW), Holborn, London."
Smiles Holly Hops;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Smiles;This one was at the Carpenter’s Arms as opposed to the Masons. The latter must work harder because this one was not a bad drop but let down by a slight weakness in the beer. The wheat adds little I feel as opposed to the great partnership of the F&G hops. A pleasant seasonal beer that helps to make London at Christmas a great place to be.
Smiles Holly Hops;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Smiles;Cask Conditioned at The Bell, Banbuery. Deep golden colour with bubbly white head. A full malt and wheaty grain flavour, heavy base flavour with a sweetish light overnote. Plenty of alcohol on the nose, warming and insistent. There is a hoppy finish which doesn't quite overcome the sweetness of the base malt.
Sulwath Criffel Ale;Castle Douglas, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sulwath Brewers;Bottle. Amber coloured beer with a strong white head. The aroma is gently roasted with mild yeastiness, and the flavour is mildly bitter and roasted with a mellow finish. Overall a reasonable bitter.

Light scent of malt, berries. Taste is standard but enjoyable: a simple bittersweet taste which leads to a surprisingly dry finish. Light body. Not the greatest of beers, but thus would be a welcome alternative to bland Scottish pub bitters.

Low intensity aroma with some biscuity character and gentle, sprucey hop notes. Very light sweetness and a gentle bitterness - overall a well-balanced taste.

Sulwath Criffel Ale;Castle Douglas, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sulwath Brewers;Bottle. At first this seems like a fairly standard bitter but there is an unusual smoky element that is actually fairly pleseant.

Clear dark amber in colour with a thin pale buff head. Aroma hasd a malty overtone with hedgerow berry fruit evident. Thin watery mouthfeel and good lacing. Mixed malts give a moist maltloaf base with hints of raisin fruit. Earthy aftertaste has a damp leaves quality to the hoppy aftertaste.

Sulwath Knockendoch;Castle Douglas, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sulwath Brewers;Bottle from the Sulwath Brewery Tap, Castle Douglas, consumed on site. Tawny brown, with a slight off-white head. Aroma of hazelnut, malt, caramel. Tiniest vegetal note. Sweet malty taste with herbal edges. The naked honesty of this brewery excites me: the beers are so simple, and they either work or don’t. This one does.
Sulwath Knockendoch;Castle Douglas, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sulwath Brewers;Bottle BBE: 6/6/15. Well-chilled. Clear, deep copper body with a minimal tan head. Strong, bready cereal notes. Toasty. Some dried fruit. Slightly resinous hop notes and a little cheese. Medium caramel sweetness, with only a light bitterness and no real perceptible sour notes. Light-bodied, particularly considering the weighty flavours. A thin, yet clouded texture. Low carbonation with a lingering smoked finish. Overall, a beer with some potential, although the body and mouth-feel don’t match the anticipation of the nose.

Aroma of citrus, hops, and slight sourness. Taste of fruit, malt, citrus, and sweetness. This medium bodied brew was well balanced and a nice drinking beer. Was surprised.
Swale Indian Summer;Maidstone, Kent, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Whitstable Brewery;"Bottle and served in a no-nik pint glass; Pours a clean golden hue with a small but mostly lasting white head and okay lace. The aroma has notes of mint leaves, mild citric and floral hops, biscuity malt, hint of oncoming oxidation, and a vapour of dusty yeast esters. The taste is mildly fruity with a equally mild pale malt background, very good balance and the best part of this brew. The finish does have a subdued papery condition which would be caused by age, but the store just got these in so I dunno, perhaps setting at customs too long? The aftertaste has some citric and astringent qualities. Thin-bodied and watery mouth feel is the biggest problem with this beer. Not the best example of a session ale but is drinkable."

Not very strong aroma of raspberry and yeast. Flavor is slightly sweet and light acidic berries with wheat and traces of spices. Medium body and average aftertaste. OK, it’s supposed to be a raspberry wheat and deliver what it is, the berries feels real and not artificial. On the other hand, I personally don’t think wheat/golden ales with berries are a good idea.

Swale Oyster Stout;Maidstone, Kent, England;Stout;Whitstable Brewery;Cask@The Market Porter, Borough, London. A bit too sweet and soft for a stout, quite light, with some sweet caramel, and then a touch of roasty, chocolatey bitterness. Needs more body and length of flavour.
Swale Oyster Stout;Maidstone, Kent, England;Stout;Whitstable Brewery;Bottle. It’s quite dark with a little reddish hue. It produced no head whatsoever. I found it somewhat refreshing due to the faint light notes. The oyster taste is existent. This would probably be better if it was paired with a meal, but it’s an okay beer.

Swale Kentish Gold;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Whitstable Brewery;"I bought this from the Bexley speciality beer shop Cork and Cask. It looks like the place is in need of some support - the shelves were mostly empty, and the range was limited; but the chap behind the counter was very friendly and knowledgable. The Swale Brewery Company who make Kentish Gold, claim that they are the only brewery in Kent to make bottle conditioned beers. I feel I had this too young - there was still a year to run on the best before date, and the beer had a very vigorous carbonation. It smelled like beer, it kinda looked like beer, and it tasted like beer. Little more to be said. A very run of the mill beer. Outstandingly average in all respects. Re-rate: Still average, still fizzy. Good fruity nose. Cork and Cask has now closed down."
Swale Kentish Gold;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Whitstable Brewery;"I am submitting this review because I wanted to convey my enjoyment of this beer. But, I should note, that I haven't actually tasted it in two years. I had Kent Gold while visiting Canterbury, U.K., in the fall of 1999. This easy-drinking beer quickly became my favorite ""new find"" during my entire trip to Britain. It's a hazy straw-yellow in color. Spicey and complex for such a light beer, with some citrus noticable. A delicate head which laced the glass. Very thirst quenching (one of the few CO2 beers I enjoyed while in the country). I could not, categorize this beer into any particular style. It was slightly reminiscent of a saison, but I know that this wasn't the style. I wish that the Swale brewery would send this beer over the Atlantic."

Unfortunately not FROM Western Australia. Golden beer with foamy white head. Laces well. Medium carbonation. Nose is over-cooked vegetables served next to an open drain. Light body, some weird sweetness in there. Finish is metallic. Horrible macro nightmare that looks good in the glass.
Emu Bitter;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Is the beer on the can label bigger than the mans head? This is the better question when drinking this beer than how good is the beer? Hot work sweaty mans beer. An appreciated lager that is not really supposed to be held in the mouth for feel and palate referencing. It would suit Asian foods as well as any Asian Lager. This is not my beer of choice but given no choice or offered an ice cold one miles from nowhere after a surf trip in the desert it is gold.

Emu Bitter;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Your all a bunch of eastern state pussies who can’t handle it. Emu Bitter is the best beer going. Its a real mans drink! Its liquid gold drunk best cold after a hard days work. Get it in to ya c#nts. Ken Oath!
Emu Bitter;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Ticking WA continues 375 ML can Golden straw color, rocky, one finger head. Looks pretty good. Falls to a thick collar and leaves nice lacing. Smells like a lager, no dry hopping. Very sad. Touches of grass, cereal, and corn. Smells like a supped up version of Emu Draft. 1% does make a difference. Grassy, metallic hop bite. It is bitter and it is not good at all. Lots of corn and sweet, stewed corn. Repulsive beer. Drink this puppy cold as hell to sort of enjoy it
Emu Draft;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Most people miss the point of this beer. It’s an inexpensive mid strength beer meant to be consumed over a chat or a meal . It’s got to be very cold and in a glass but it’s simple ordinary beer . It’s a typical Perth beer ( though not made there anymore ) on a hot day , a cold Emu Draft is heaven and it won’t get you drunk like Export . If the weather is mild and the beer is not cold there are better options . It’s only available in cans but if pour properly it in a middle glass it loses the metallic taste and look much better . It’s all about context with this beer . There are better beers but in its place it’s good drinking .
Emu Draft;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Can from Copper & Oak Liquor Merchants 190416. Pretty miserable beer this one but this comes as no surprise really considering it is a mass produced pale lager. Lacking in flavour is possibly the most complimentary thing I can say about this beer.
Emu Draft;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pale golden body with frothy airy head. Aroma of wet paper, tastes like nothing much. Finish is non-existant. Overall weak and bland
Emu Draft;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);375 ML can Golden caramel straw color. One finger bright white head. Nice retention to it. Nose is cereal and corn flakes. Thin and watery nose. Are there any hops to this at all?? Taste is corn flakes and artificial sugar. Just need Tony the Tiger and set. Way too artificial sweet . Light bodied, high carbonation, and thin. Does its job as a mid.
Emu Draft;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Sometimes my mates drink this. Water taste better so I usually stick with that. When I don’t stick with that, I usually regret the first sip
Emu Draft;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);For some strange reason I drank a river of this crap until I realised what horrible beer this was. Bland, watery, low carbonation and very little imagination. I would not recommend this stuff to anyone. Absolute shit!
Emu Draft;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pale gold/amber in colour, thin bodied with low to average carbonation. Small white head. Flavourless and watery, short dry finish, slightly bitter. Not great. (375ml can)
Emu Draft;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);375 ml can - Pale goldy amber colour with a lousy head which vanishes shortly after pouring. Medium carbination. Thin and watery with a weak grassy flavour. Rather pitiful really.
Emu Draft;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Watered down version of Emu Export. Not awful but pretty ordinary. Full points for value for money - 30 cans for $22. But I think that pretty much sums up the quality of this beer. Best drank in summer, chilled to the max.
Emu Draft;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Like Emu export, only more gassy with a stinkier nose. Also, I can only find it in cans here in Perth, so automatic points deducted for that.
Swan Draught;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);0,33l bottle from PWS, Perth. Pours veyr pale golden with a medium head. Aroma is light malts. Flavor is tap water with some malts. Well, it's better than Budweiser.

Swan Draught;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I’ve drunk beer all over the world and this beer rates as good as anything. Been brewed since 1857, full bodied taste and the best thing....it’s got WA in it. Get it into ya

Swan Draught;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Nothing special but bit of bite on the palate. Typical macro brewery product. Popular here in Castle Hotel York Western Australia.
Swan Draught;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Tasted 4/4/2016. Draught at Caves Hotel, Yallingup, WA. Poured a crystal clear pale amber with 5mm of bright white foam that diminished slowly to a collar that laced well. Carbonation low and coarse. Aroma of pale malt; no obvious hops. Taste of sweetish malt and no real bitterness; goes a bit sour as it warms. Light and thin body. Crisp, smooth and a hint of bitterness on the finish. Typical lager from a macro-brewery."

1857 Bitter;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Deep copper tone? Mine must have been bleached then. See my comments about the Swan Gold. Same vat? I suspect so.
1857 Bitter;Thebarton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Off yellow with a small head with a bite of watered down acid. Not the best midstrength lager around. Tend to steer clear of this one.
Swan Gold;Canning Vale, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Swan Brewery (Lion Nathan Co.);The great Aussie invention. A mid-strength beer. Really these styles have an identity crisis. Too low in alcohol to be a real beer and too high to be a light and therefore absolutely abhorrent. Yeah, nuff said, except for the blah blah about lack of body, astringent flavour and gutless flavour.
Swan Gold;Canning Vale, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Swan Brewery (Lion Nathan Co.);Golden with a fast disappearing head. Very bland with acidic flavour. Not recommended.
Swan Gold;Canning Vale, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Swan Brewery (Lion Nathan Co.);they don't make this anymore so i had to drink one that is about 5 years old. it was very cloudy, and had chunks in it. it smelt very sweet, and tasted the same. there was no head, but considering how old it was, it wasn't bad for an off beer.
Swan Gold;Canning Vale, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Swan Brewery (Lion Nathan Co.);This beer has been discontinued, long ago. The reason: it was terrible. I don't know where mike84(22) got his taste buds etc from ..

Tooheys New;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);My go to tap beer when I’m at a pub, not that great out of a can or bottle but delicious draught beer(weird phenomenon) Taste: mild - medium bitterness, low hops and slight metallic taste Body: the way lager should be with a moderate head Smell: smells like my early 20s late teens
Tooheys New;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Toohey's new. Drunk from bottle. Very, very nice. Pleasant aroma, full heavy on the malt and hops but not too bitter or even fruity. Good aftertaste
Tooheys New;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Aroma is malts/slightly earthy and fruit. The flavor is malts, mild fruit, a hint of caramel and a lightl bitter/hoppy finish.
Tooheys New;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);This is a classic lager that I always come back to, I don't believe there's too much of a reason to dislike it.

Tooheys New;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Seen in most bars in Sydney this larger may be a nice alternative to VB. Though dont expect much of a party for the palate
Tooheys Extra Dry (TED);Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Boring foam, boring yellow, smells like a backed up toilet or maybe an old couch cushion after somebody farted in it after a heavy bean dinner. Taste is rather vile grain with heavy sugar and light ammonia. Lingering chemicals on the tongue. Awful and more awful, as well as especially pointless.
Tooheys Extra Dry (TED);Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);The is living. I had a 'TED' the other day simply because I liked the name. I didn't expect to fall instantly, head-over-heels in love. Never had I tried a beer with such a complex, yet delicate taste profile. The body is incredible. Will definitely be back for more when the wife lets me have another beer next year. This was the absolute highlight of my birthday party.
Tooheys Extra Dry (TED);Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Best served in an ice cold stubbie Taste watered down Tooheys New, crisp finish. Body, what body Smell is light lager One of the popular lower carb beers, comparable to Carlton Dry Great on a hot day or as a session beer as they go down with no effort at all and a respectable 4.4%. Also good if you’re watching your weight
Tooheys Extra Dry (TED);Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);This is by far the best beer I have ever had been drinking it for about 10 years now but the plastic package that it's wrapped in is a pain in the ass surly you can come up with something better I have dropped so many beers out of the fridge trying to get the dahm things out of the packaging its bullshit thanks fingers

Tooheys Red Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Ok, this is the cheapest of the cheap in the Tooheys stable so........750ml bottle (twist-top!) into schooner glass. Skunky nose from bottle, cooked vegetables from glass. Pale amber beer with many bubbles and lasting billowing white head. Has a chalky mineral water taste that zings on the tongue. Abrupt finish with a little malt, hard to find any hops in here. Actually palatable if you are desperate. Must be very cold. Lawnmower beer? Yes. BBQ beer? No.
Tooheys Red Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Can, 0.375l. Clear pale golden color with large frothy white head and average sparkling appearance. Aroma is malty, grassy, grainy and vegetably. Taste starts with moderate sweet malt, fresh grainy sour and metallic following, dry mouthfeel and light bitter finish. Light body, thin texture and average carbonation in palate. Oh my deer, nothing special...
Tooheys Red Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Poured a clear pale amber colour with a thin white bubbly head that diminished quickly and developed moderate lacing. Moderate carbonation with medium sized bubbles forming trails. Aroma of sweet malt. Taste slightly sweet followed by a very mild, almost nil, hops bitterness. Light body bordering on watery. A weak flavoured nothing beer that is not really bitter.
Tooheys Red Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);You look at the can, and just know its gonna be bad. Pours a celar gold, moderate carbonation and a frothy white head. Bready, malty aroma, a bit funky. Empty, watery flavour and texture. Slight bitter after taste.
Tooheys Red Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Bottled (thanks to my cousin Kaj!). No matter what the name says about red, this beer pours a golden colour with a white small head. Aroma is bready malts, some slight floral and herbal notes as well. Flavour is malts, some mild grassy and herbal notes along with mild bitterness. So atleast the ""bitter"" part is true in the name, even though to the style it is a pale lager. Better than expected."
Tooheys Red Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);If heavily chilled then I actually don’t mind this one all that much. Sweet and slightly malty it’s certainly a better drink than Tooheys extra dry in my opinion, and it’s cheaper.
Tooheys Red Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);From a 375ml bottle on 13/6/2010. A nostalgic trip back to the days when I was a young man and would buy cases of Toohey’s Red because it was nearly always on special. I’m pretty sure it used to be more than 4%. So how does it scrub up now that I know what a really good beer tastes like? It’s actually not quite as bad as I thought it would be. It does actually have a discernible sweet, malty, grassy aroma. In the mouth, it’s sweet, a touch metallic, with a very slight hint of hops. There is worse out there, but my case buying days are over.
Tooheys Red Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);375ml can. Honey colour with a deep dense white foam blanket. Aroma of soap suds and dish water. Light and sweet flavour with nothing that really comes through. Very basic and boring.
Tooheys Gold Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Easy drinking beer. Still have your scruples at the end of a session while others are noticeably affected by the alcohol of heavy beers. Good on ya George!
Tooheys Gold Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Not a total disaster. Clean and refreshing if of course devoid of real flavour. Kinda buzzy and dry but otherwise line and length for the Australian pale lager market. If I needed to drink mainstream low abv beer then I might look at this again.
Tooheys Gold Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Gold pour aromas lemon grassy flavours medium bitter grassy lemon dull old cabbage my word they have improved the finish dull flat vegetable grassy flat lemon a bitter not good
Tooheys Gold Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Can (no bbe found), had during the 10 year anniversary of 2Pac on RB (Thanks Kaj!). Golden colour, small white head. Aroma is grass, some bready malts as well as mild hayish and cardboardy notes. Flavour is grass, bread, some mild earth and herbs. Thin palate. Seems like this beer either is hard to get, or nobody bothers rating it.
Tooheys Gold Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);375ml can. Clear amber colour with a thick white head and mild carbonation. Aroma of wet cardboard and straw. Unpleasant and inviting. Not a bad taste for a midstrength. Dry in the mouth with a good mouthfeel. More flavour than some midstrength beers.
Tooheys Gold Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Can - Pours a pale golden with a loose white head. Not much of an aroma, maybe some malt, but also a bit cardboardy. Pretty bland small amount of malt, slightly metallic finish. Not great but a lot better than some of their other effots!
Tooheys Gold Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A dire concoction straight from the gates of hell. Awful. Not even enough alcohol to get pissed if that was the intent.
Tooheys Gold Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"375 ml can (""Master Brewed version"", which as the can says is brewed by ""Tooheys or by related companies under license"") - Straw Gold in colour with thin white head which rapidly died away to nothing. Medium carbonation. Watery. A little bland in flavour and bitterness but on a hot day it would be better than a softdrink."
Tooheys Gold Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Light straw coppery golden body, poor head, average mid-strength beer taste, some light bitterness,watery.
Tooheys Gold Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Typical cidery urine aroma, tastes like bitter soda water. No sweetness which is good. Reminds me of drinking my old man’s Carlton Light whilst camping back in the day.
Tooheys Old;Lidcombe, Australia;Brown Ale;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);330ml bottle. Poured a clear medium brown colour with a short-lived frothy off white head. The aroma is toffee caramel malt, light nutty, light spicy liqouirce. The flavour is moderate to light bitter sweet, with a light, slightly watery, dry, spicy, caramel malt, light red berry fruit, woody hop bitter palate. Medium bodied with average to soft carbonation.
Tooheys Old;Lidcombe, Australia;Brown Ale;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Had a work dinner. 22 of us sitting around a huge table, every with a pale ale except me with this Tooheys Old. It seemed to impress my Korean co-workers which probably made this taste better than it did.
Tooheys Old;Lidcombe, Australia;Brown Ale;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Tap at park beach bowls club, coffs harbour. Dark brown color, white head. Smooth roasty nose, some coffee notes. Nice smooth little roasty taste, some coffee notes, some fruity notes.
Tooheys Old;Lidcombe, Australia;Brown Ale;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Ah Tooheys Old. The best find at your local bowls club in Aus. Best beer in the Tooheys line up by a country mile. A little bit of bitter coffee, some sweet biscuit chocolate too. A hidden gem in plain site.

Tooheys Old;Lidcombe, Australia;Brown Ale;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Drank from a 375mL bottle at a hotel, BB May 2018. Milk chocolate taste but finishes empty. Sad thin body. I will properly re-review if I get an opportunity. Fun fact: Old was my first ever beer years ago (and unsurprisingly I hated it).
Tooheys Old;Lidcombe, Australia;Brown Ale;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Old, but not old as in aged. Old as in that puff of dust you get by hitting an old cushion. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Tooheys Old;Lidcombe, Australia;Brown Ale;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);On tap. Schooner. Pours a ink black with a small tan head. Aroma: Roasted malts dominate. Mild coffee beans, toasted bread, dark chocolate notes. Taste: Malts dominate the flavour balance. Slightly creamy texture. Moderate carbonation. Mild bitterness lingers on the palate. A very good dark beer.
Tooheys Old;Lidcombe, Australia;Brown Ale;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);bottle. tastes roasted malts and light chocolate. medium bodied. no hops aroma or flavor.
Tooheys Old;Lidcombe, Australia;Brown Ale;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Light toasted, nutty and toffee malt aroma and upfront sweet malt flavours of the toasted and caramel type. Mild and easy drinking with some malt depth but fairly thin body also. Low on the bitterness. Pleasant enough.
Tooheys Amber Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);One of the better tooheys beers. At least it has a nice colour and a slight hops flavour.
Tooheys Amber Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A fair attempt at a mid-strength bitter by Tooheys. Better than Tooheys gold, but who drinks mid-strength anyway?
Tooheys Amber Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Great label, you just have to like something that has a buck on it. Trouble is you have to pay more than one to taste this and like all mid-strength beers it is just not worth it. Nice colour though.
Tooheys Amber Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"My sample has had an extended lagering period you might say (it sat in my dad's beer fridge for the last 2 years) and it seems to have done good things. The main reason it sat there for so long is that no-one has been game to touch it (it's reputation precedes it) so I was pleasantly surprised to find, after I got by the aroma of fermenting carrots, that there is actually a bit of malt to be tasted, some sweetness reminscent of a carrot cake and very mild bitterness. I think I even noticed a bit of body (shock horror, there has to be something wrong with this bottle) but the most shocking thing about this is the (high) score I am giving it... I cannot recommend this beer under usual circumstances but if you want to try it at it's best, there is another bottle in my dad's beer fridge... ;-)"

Tooheys Pils;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Slightly stale aroma. Clear golden colour with good head. Fruity flavor with long finish. Light body with high carbonation.
Tooheys Pils;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);OLD NOTES OCT 14, 2003 Not really a remarkable pilsner by any means. Quite weak hop and malt character. Probably somewhat less offensive than most other Tooheys brews, but that says very little of it pedigree.
Tooheys Pils;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle. Not a bad beer. It actually has a bit of flavour, not as hoppy as i would like, but a very drinkable beer.
Tooheys Pils;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);pretty good pilsner. Nice in appearance and flavour. Not a whole lot of excitement but still a passable drink.
Tooheys Pils;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);tasted recently at an Aussie beer tasting - outside of cooper stout, this was the best of the rest - and that is not much of a compliment - at least this had some body/palate, but don’t go out of your way
Tooheys Pils;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Hop malt aroma with smokeyness. Clear amber colour with poor head and lacing. Malt spice hop flavour. Smooth palate.
Tooheys Pils;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle - Pours a golden colour with a frothy white head. Not a very nice aroma, a mixture of boiled rice and cardboard! Starts of with a slight sweetness and then a vegetable thing. I notice they have dropped the saaz hops and the alcohol content to 4.5%. The last time I tried this it was much better.
Tooheys Pils;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);345ml bottle. Clear and sparkling golden in colour with big bubbles that make up an average snowy head. Strong hop aroma and feels fresh and crisp in the mouth with a well balanced bitterness.
Tooheys Pils;Lidcombe, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle. Clear yellow with a tiny head that disappeared. Malt, vegetables and metallic notes. I’m not detecting any true saaz character in this beer. Poorly advertised and definitely not a pils in any shape or form. It doesn’t really fair much better as a lager either.
Tooheys Blue Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);375ml can into glass. I didn’t know they still made this. Nose is slightly hoppy, mostly cooked vegetables. Beer is dark copper with thin white head. A few bubbles. Watery and......watery. Finish is distant cardboard, a little malt then good old Aussie macro cooked vegetables. Not good but strangely given its low ABV, its colour and very low carbonation it could be the only Australian macro ’bitter’ that really is a bitter!
Tooheys Blue Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pours a dark honey color with a creamy head that fades to so me lacing. Aroma is quite muted with a trace of citrus, malt sweetness and grain. Taste is just a bit of malt sweetness and grain, really quite bland. Has a weak bitterness and fairly clean finish. Light body, a bit watery and short on any flavor. This beer is not really worth the effort. Even the brewers name is hard to find.
Tooheys Blue Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Can - pours golden with a frothy white head. Metallic cardboard aroma.Very thin bodied, just carbonation up front with a metallic finish.
Tooheys Blue Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Another really bad attempt from Tooheys to make a beer. This stuff sells from under $20 for a case, and thats still about $19.50 too much
Tooheys Blue Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Tooheys seem to be distancing themselves from this 2.3% abv ""full flavoured light"". So should beer-drinkers. You have to look pretty hard to find the brewer’s name on the can. You also have to look pretty hard to find much to like here. The aroma is vintage Tooheys wet cardboard and metallic POR with a few honey notes. Thin in the limbs, with a dry, metallic finish. Gassy. Some honey sweetness and better bitterness than some of their higher abv beers. Funnily enough, it looks better than most LNN brews, pouring an intense gold with a rich lather of lasting foam. By no means the worst in the range. (375ml can from Amatos. Best before 7/5/07, or ideally not at all)"
Tooheys Blue Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I bought this beer with 4 mates when I was 16. $5 each for a case (30 I think). 2 cans and none of us were even tipsy. Had to go and cut some hose from the neighbours to make a beer bong for the rest and was still standing. Lucky their parents had a case of VB other wise the night would have been lost. Hope they don’t make Blue anymore.
Tooheys Blue Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottled. Pale amber, average head. Light grasssy aroma. Fatty and lightly metallic with thin mouthfeel, Dry with ashy, resiny finish and a hint of raisin. There’s worse low alcs, but that doesn’t mean that this beer is any good.
Tooheys Blue Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Surprisingly dark - amber I’d say with an OK head. Sweet toffee aroma with some yeast. Tastes sweet and caramelly with stewed fruits. Flabby but not that watery which is a surprise. No hop and some faint metal in the finish. Some nasty spirit presence occasionally. Nothing that good about it but it’s certainly not that offensive.
Tooheys Blue Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Guam SwillFest 2004: Pours golden yellow with a thin white head. Had an initial aroma of day old coffee. It still has a small coffee aroma. Overall, really not that bad. Light on everything- alcohol, flavor, aroma, palate. Over carbonated but refreshing. Crisp finish.
Tooheys Blue Bitter;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Dark golden/light amber. Aroma is of cidery cane sugar and a little hoppiness. Slight grainyness with a little POR hoppiness. overall a bland watery beer, but not so bad when compared to some other Australian light beers.
MeZ;Lidcombe, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Its a good idea and a whole lot better than cold shots. It just doesn't quite make it. If I wanted my own beer tequila combination I'd make it a lot stronger than this.
MeZ;Lidcombe, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I forgot I had this about a year ago. I do recall it well enough however. What a combination! And CUB decided to do the same type of thing with vodka!! Yeah, just Corona without the complexity, flavour, aroma, body and panache. A real RTD (ready to drainpour).
MeZ;Lidcombe, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Super pale gold clear with a medium small head. Smells like a cross between a cheap gueuze and sweet lemon bitter cordial. After that it plummets downhill real quick. Lime lemon cordial sweet palate and flavours. I'd rather drink a cordial than this one. does not really deserve to be called a beer. Its really an alcopop with some beer.
MeZ;Lidcombe, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);you would not want to drink more than one of these. they are way to sweet, the only beer you can taste is in the after taste. after a few mouthfuls you can no longer even taste the beer. there is to much sugar and citrus flavour. it also goes to your head, and is quite alcoholic.
MeZ;Lidcombe, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Very poor beer would be much better with a reduced citrus flavour...........

Jack Russell Best Bitter Ale;Camino, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;From Feb 2006 Poured from bottle(room temp) a cloudy medium gold with a fairly large head of foam that dissipated slowly leaving a fine layer with some lacing. The smell has malty and earthy tones to it. The taste is is a nice mix of sweet malt and hop bitterness with an earthy biscuity goodness in the background. This is yummy! And...at just 4%abv, I think it's a prime example of how a beer doesn't need a ton of alcoholic content to make it a great tasting beer. Well done, Jack Russell Brewing!

Jack Russell Best Bitter Ale;Camino, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;"Bottle labeled ""Best Bitter Ale"" from Corti Bros., Sacramento. The aroma is so roasted it smacks of coffee! Hazy tea/amber color with a white head that barely arrived. Very smooth, medium body with light, creamy carbonation. Some stone fruit comes forth, and the roasted malt is right there. Must be bitter floral hop or something, because there is a lot of bitter, but no citrus or resin. It certainly fits an English bitter style, but it is different. A bit harsher in the finish, perhaps. Good ale."
Jack Russell Best Bitter Ale;Camino, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Bottle: Called English Amber Ale: Golden brown, puffy creamy head, lots of carbonation.

Jack Russell London Porter;Camino, California, United States;Porter;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;From Feb 2006 Poured from bottle(room temp) a pitch black with a nice brownish head of foam that dissipated fairly slowly leaving a fine layer with some lacing. The smell is of roasted malt and it's quite strong. The taste is also of roasted malt with a touch of oatmeal and..there's a bit of bitterness there that balances the flavours out nicely in the finish. This is one tasty Porter that deserves to be tried! Bottom line: Another very tasty brew from the Jack Russell Brewing Company and a London Porter interpretation that, I think, compares very favourably to the Fullers. Get some!
Jack Russell London Porter;Camino, California, United States;Porter;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;"""the bar is set awful high in this style by fullers, but this is pretty dang good, and one of Jack Russells better brews. malted chocolate and roasted malt abound. thin, but flavorful and aromatic."""

Jack Russell London Porter;Camino, California, United States;Porter;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Draft. Nutty, malty aroma with light hints of chocolate, coffee and roast. The body is a dark ruddy brown and holds a thin tan head. Chocolate, some sour twang, toast, cocoa, coffee and a decent blast of roast malt. Not bad but not something I’d drink regularly. Just seems a little off.
Jack Russell London Porter;Camino, California, United States;Porter;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;From a 12 oz bottle purchased from Corti Bros in Sacramento for $1.49. Poured very dark brown that looked nearly black, but when held up to the light turned out to ber a very dark red.. Head was quite dark also tending toward tan. Great lacing rings Nose is of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, and medium bodied. Flavor is rich dark malts with light hops in the background. Finish is dry and good to the last drop. A really quite excellent porter.
Jack Russell London Porter;Camino, California, United States;Porter;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Bottle from Corti Bros. Nice darkly roasted, nigh toasted, malt aroma. Near opaque black/brown color with a beige head. A bit thin in body, with light, creamy carbonation. It’s definitely dark toast. We are talking antique Guinness, nearly. There’s coffee. Small hint of chocolate. The finish is dry, with a very light sour note, and dark toast. It seems to be a high quality porter that could rival some stouts. Smooth it is.

Jack Russell Olde Ale Winter Warmer;Camino, California, United States;Old Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Bottle. Dark mahogony beer with a tan head. Sweet malt and toffee aroma with light earth. Sweet malt and toffee flavor with light pine. Medium bodied. Sweet malt and toffee lingers with light hops.
Jack Russell Olde Ale Winter Warmer;Camino, California, United States;Old Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;This reddish -brown ale poured with a decent beige head and a strong roasted malt aroma. It looks good and smells good, but the flavor is lacking. There is some chocolate malt and coffee, but the finish is metallic.
Jack Russell Olde Ale Winter Warmer;Camino, California, United States;Old Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Bottle from the brewery. Dark reddish brown color with a decent light tan head. Rich aromas of chocolate and treacle. About medium in body with creamy carbonation. It does seem to have treacle, maybe some coffee. Maybe even chocolate. Something like a porter on steroids? Finish is rather astringent. Not sure there’s significant hop - but something is balancing the sweet. Think I got lucky. This one had been kept in the cooler!
Jack Russell Olde Ale Winter Warmer;Camino, California, United States;Old Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Not sure what it is with Jack Russell beers. They are either average or below average and this was no different. A malty aroma with a nutty angle but with a heaping dose of wet paper. Uh-oh. Oxidation time. It also set in on the flavor of the beer, which combines with the overly sweet malt bill and smallish hops made this barely drinkable.
Jack Russell Olde Ale Winter Warmer;Camino, California, United States;Old Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Bottled. CO2 FLEW out of this bottle when I opened it. When I poured it, it foamed over the top of my Duvel glass before I’d even poured half of it. It took three or four minutes for the tan, stiff egg-white-like head to subside enough to allow the rest of the beer to be poured. Even then it foamed up again making me wait to pour again. I’ve never seen a head of this size on a beer that wasn’t infected. Stay tuned... The color is black with a reddish hue. As I wipe the bubbles from my nose I can tell you the aroma is full of chocolate, prunes and cigars. When the bubbles finally subsided, I found the beer to be somewhat chocolaty and very much watery with notes of ashtray. It leaves a tongue numbing aftertaste of dirt and coal(?) Great beer for smellin’, bad beer for drinkin’. I’ll be pouring the rest of this out...
Jack Russell Olde Ale Winter Warmer;Camino, California, United States;Old Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Dark amber color. Small head. Aroma is malty and slightly spicy. A medium bodied ale. Malts are nutty and sweet. Slightly spicy, cinnamon and nutmeg. A very typical “inter warmer’ beer, but there is a kind of cardboard flavor as well. Its more annoying than unpleasant, but it still shouldn’t be there and detracts from the beer and cannot be recommended. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Jack Russell Olde Ale Winter Warmer;Camino, California, United States;Old Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Dark brown. Malty but sourish. Not much bitterness..........................
Jack Russell Olde Ale Winter Warmer;Camino, California, United States;Old Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Attrocious swill. Dirty, root-like flavors that coat the mouth and leave a sourish, unpleasant after-taste. Avoid at all costs.

Pours a thinnish ivory head, poorly retained, with minimal lacing, over a slightly medium amber (SRM 13) body.....nose is citrus including grapefruit, tangerine, orange, hints of toffee/caramel, light herbs, balance to the hops......taste is light cereal malts,lightly toffee/caramel sweetness, with floral notes, citrus, with grapefruit tangerine, leading to a moderate bitter finish.....mouth feel, light of medium body, no alcohol, low carbonation. This is a soft and gentle IPA. The bitterness is relatively low and the malts are muted. The aromas and flavors of the hops are pleasantly complex and in charge of the beer. It could use a slightly bigger malt and matching hop backbones. BJCP 7/2/14/4/7

Estes Park Trail Ridge Red;Estes Park, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Estes Park Brewery;This ale poured a clear, dark red colour with a soapy head. Not very appealing to look at.

Estes Park Pale Ale;Estes Park, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Estes Park Brewery;12oz bottle. Old School APA. Not that impressive ever, and certainly not even close to par for 2017. Unfiltered murky orange-amber body. Thin, creamy, off-white head. Old school Ringwood style yeast tones...earthy, caramel, sweet. Resinous, but not that much hop depth. Drinkable I suppose, but not what I’m looking for in an APA.
Estes Park Pale Ale;Estes Park, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Estes Park Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a decent looking golden copper color body with a decent half finger white foamy head that simmered down to a nice adequate milky looking film of a lacing speckling the glass. The smell had a decent amount of citric like hops but also a balanced amount of caramel malts. The taste was sweet through the malts and the hops but still carried a decent amount of bitterness to allow a pervasive bitterness on my taste buds. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium with a fair sessionability about it. The carbonation was actually smoother than most APA’s I’ve had, still no worries. Overall, not a bad APA, just not one that shows enough to go bonkers about.

Estes Park Barley Wine;Estes Park, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Estes Park Brewery;"From May 2007 Purchased from Wilbur's in Ft Collins This pours a deep amber/brown with little to no head of foam and has a tiny bit of lacing. The smell is spot on for a BWSA for me. Lots of yummy caramel malt and dark fruit hitting my nose. The taste on first sip is huge! I'm getting the big caramel that I mentioned in the smell along with some dark fruit, plum and black cherry,(light on the cherry) and a good roastiness and some grain. Further sips in and the flavours just won't quit and yeah, the 10% abv is obviously there but taking the small sips that I'm taking, it is no way near overwhelming. I'd say it's more of a soothing effect on my taste buds and I don't get a burn when it goes down. Yum. The finish is very tasty with a mix of fruit semi sweetness and a roasty bitterness. The aftertaste lingers on for what seems like forever and in this case, that's a good thing. ;^) The mouthfeel borders on thick, as in thick and chewy, where it *should* be, and the carbonation is light, also where it should be. I'm darned impressed with this BWSA, to say the least! Bottom line: This is the first brew I've tried from Estes Park Brewery and my hat is off to them for making a very true to style, abundantly flavourful, and oh so tasty sipping Barleywine Style Ale. I'd buy this again without hesitation."

Estes Park Bear Lake Blueberry Wheat;Estes Park, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Estes Park Brewery;Reviewed from notes. Consumed last Summer. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance had a nice hazy golden orange to amber color. The smell had a nice blend of sweet blueberry notes subtly combining with a decent wheat malt base. The taste was mainly sweet with a light wheat kick at the end. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a sessionability that could be slightly discerned. The carbonation was subdued and slightly smooth but yet the wheat that was in this one maintained a certain mildness that wasn’t necessarily expected. Overall flavorful sweet fruity Summer ale in the blueberry fashion, uh... heck yeah, definitely one of the better blueberry ales on the market these days.

Cains Dark Mild (Keg/Can);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Mild Ale;Cains;This is a backlog rating from 2012 from a can, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are toasted, chocolate, earthy, I won't revisit this.
Cains Dark Mild (Keg/Can);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Mild Ale;Cains;"retrospective notes as i have just discovered this to be discontinued. always had cains canned, and found it to be smooth and refreshing for a mild british ale. that being said, this is far from my favourite form of beer and this - how can i put it ""mildly"" (haha) - is a fairly bland style sometimes. i always enjoyed my cans of cains; chocolatey and malty with a old style taste. ABV is incredibly low, though."
Cains Dark Mild (Keg/Can);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Mild Ale;Cains;Poured into a perfect pint. 4.25 A: Clear dark brown color. Two and a half fingers of creamy/frothy tan head. Retention is very good and a short ring of lacing is left. 3.75 S: Roasty toasty graininess with a hint of ash. Overall quite dry with notes of chocolate, nuts, and caramel. Touch of mineral to round things off. Decently powerful for a beer of its size. 3.75 T: Like the nose, there’s a lot of toastiness with some roasty component. Dry with a moderate bitterness. Chocolate, nuttiness, mineral and caramel form a subtle complexity. Again, a lot going on given the ABV. 4.25 M: Lighter body. Good moderate carbonation with a surprising amount of creaminess. Super smooth, well done. 4.0 D: Pretty good beer to reach for if you are in the mood for a dark session beer. No real complaints. DavoleBomb, May 29, 2013

Cains Dark Mild (Keg/Can);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Mild Ale;Cains;"I had a bit of a heavy night of it last night and so as a consequence I wasn’t after anything too challenging today. I thought ""Ooh, mild, that shouldn’t hurt me too much."" Well, I was a little surprised at how dark it really was. It verges on black with some ruby port in the dimple and has a thick skim of head that looks creamy with a tinge of green. The aroma is of dark caramel, chocolate and cocoa with maybe just a niff of rum? Thickish and creamy texture with sweetness aplenty. It has its charms this beer, but in my current state it is a little heavy going, even for the laudable lower alcohol content. I don’t think my review does this beer a disservice though. On any other day I would still enjoy its flavour just as much."
Cains Dark Mild (Keg/Can);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Mild Ale;Cains;500 ml can I am a little disappointed in not getting to try something from the area while in England but that is a good reason to go back. In the meantime this county tick is a respectable beer if you still happen across it. It is nothing special and being transported across the ocean does it no favors. That said I have had worse mild ales. Aroma / Appearance - Velvety chocolate fluid pours easily into the pint glass. A mocha head remains from the vigorous pour. Chocolate cream pie, sweet malts, and gentle roasted notes accent a mostly balanced and low key mild. Flavor / Palate - The body is a trace thin even for a mild ale. Cool coffee and inexpensive chocolate alternate the primary focus before a soothing low key finish. Fading quickly there is not much left after the final sip. If you want a fair representation of the English mild style this does a good job. However there are certainly better offerings out there when on the other side of the ocean.

Cains FA (Bottle/Can);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cains;Can’t believe I’ve never reviewed this before: 500ml bottle best before the end of July 2012, poured into an Abbot Ale badged glass tankard two weeks before that date. The deep golden body had a slight hazy look but the perfectly formed head and aroma compensated for it completely. Malts all the way here with hops always trying to break even both in the smell and taste: this ensures the beer is semi-sweet and has a mini bitterness at all times as well. The 5.0% ABV suits it nicely and it sits well as the beer sinks down my tankard leaving some thick lacing after each gulp.
Cains FA (Bottle/Can);Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cains;Bottle, 5%. Slightly hazy deep golden/amber with small off-white head.

Granite Brewery IPA;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;IPA;Granite Brewery (Toronto);Tap at Granite in Toronto. Slightly hazy golden with off-white head. Interesting and not at all IPA-ish fruitiness, a kind of passionfruit nose and flavour. Carbonation really mild, and not too surprisingly, watery on the palate. Really soft on the tongue, which is rather pleasant... Yet how it all comes together... Not exactly the kind of IPA I’d enjoy very much or write home about. Pleasant enough to finish the sample though.

Granite Brewery IPA;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;IPA;Granite Brewery (Toronto);Cask pour at Victory Cafe looks fantastic: butter yellow body with a plump & curvy one finger head. Clear case of nice legs, shame about her face. This is a mild tasting British style IPA, with a flaccid palate & far too flowery flavour. May go well for a quick pint before work, but other than that your other options have more pull.

Stepan Razin Martovskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Very attractive amber beer. Purple on the edges white sticky head...very rocky for a lager. Bubblegum chemicals in the nose. Fruity for a lager. Like Juicy Fruit in a glass. Flvaors dive, however. Chemicals are the first thing that strike the palate. Ripe fruits and juicy fruit. Slick grapefruit flavors followed by a chemical bitterness. Crips like a lager but fruity nonetheless. In the end this beer is kind of gross. Dull flat corn ending. Gray.
Stepan Razin Martovskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Dark amber with foamy, quickly diminishing head - very malty aroma, with cookie dough, brown sugar, rolled oats - light enough in flavor to make a good session brew, which is good for the style - however, it’s flavorful enough to keep you wanting more - caramel, brown sugar and rolled oats from the aroma come back in the flavor - a unique oktoberfest - kind of tastes like a watered down barleywine, but still pretty good.
Stepan Razin Martovskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Umber color with a orange brilliance when held to the light. Diminished head to a dense tan lid. Simple sweet aromas of light caramel and brown sugar. Some hints of fresh cut birchwood and vanilla in the background. Flavors are also rather sweet and simple. Light toffee and caramel. A nice toasted malt linger though. The brews from the eastern bloc counties have improved significantly in the past few years. Still not great, but at least not the alcohol infused wood and infected flavors of the days of yore. So there is hope.
Stepan Razin Martovskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);A dark amber beer with no head. The aroma is yeasty and malty. And so is the flavor. A good beer for a Russian beer.
Stepan Razin Martovskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Amber color. Well malty nose, with a hay note, and sweetish. Sweet taste, lacking any character.
Stepan Razin Martovskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Bottled. Ruby coloured. Aroma of plums. Sweet and clean, rounded and lightly roasty. A plain Russian take on the Märzen style.
Stepan Razin Martovskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Bottled. Chestnut colour with a blink-and-you-miss-it head and moderate condition. Toffee malt aromas like a pale dunkle, caramel in the mouth and a long, initialy malty finish that turns chalky and quite dry at the end. Not quite sure whether it wants to be a dunkle or a märzen.
Stepan Razin Martovskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Thinnish, carbonic amber lager. Called Martovskoye in Russian..............
Stepan Razin Temnoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);FTA: A simple example of Russian dark lager. I was drinking it for the first time when I was 16, during December 2000 cold frozen starry night. This must be ticked and noted. There are still several brews missing. Martovskoe?
Stepan Razin Spetsialnoe (Special);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);FTA: A simple example of Russian lager. I actually have all of the Stepan Razin caps and some of the labels in my archive. Loved the brewery.
Stepan Razin Spetsialnoe (Special);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);500ml bottle from supermarket in Torfyanovka. Clear yellow colur, small fizzy white mostly dissipating head, little bit of lacing. Aroma of grain, grass and a hint of apple. Taste is initially fairly balanced and slightly acidic, turning into a short acidic finish with a hint of bitterness and a chalcky feel. Light body, dry texture, lively carbonation. A very inoffensive bulk lager that doesn’t taste very well made, better to avoid.
Stepan Razin Spetsialnoe (Special);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);0.5 bottle. Pale golden color, and a big, white, frothy head which even leaves some lacing. Obvious pale lager aroma: pale malts, some hops and barnyard aromas - very hackneyed. Taste is corny too, has a lot of cereals and a touch of malts, not hop at all. Light body, thin texture and average carbonation. Finish is rather short and has even more grain. Overall the beer like most Russian lagers I have tasted is good in respect that it’s not awful, drinkable too.
Stepan Razin Spetsialnoe (Special);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Bottle. 4.0% ABV. Golden color with a collapsing medium white head. Malty aroma with light notes of hops. Flavor is sweet and malty with some hop bitterness in the finish. Light to medium body.
Stepan Razin Spetsialnoe (Special);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);(Bottled, 4.0% ABV) Paleish golden color with a quite small, lacy head. A sweetish aroma of honey-corny malt and some acidity. Corny-malty flavor with some added vegetables and very little hops. Light-bodied, somewhat foamy-carbonated palate. Definitely not interesting, but still a bearable brew. Lacks most of the good features of Petrovskoye and Admiralteyskoe.
Stepan Razin Spetsialnoe (Special);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);A yellow beer with no head and no aroma. The flavor is malty with notes of honey and hops. A boring pilsener.
Stepan Razin Spetsialnoe (Special);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Golden coloured. Quite weak and boring The flavour is sweet with a dry finish. Thin.
Stepan Razin Spetsialnoe (Special);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Frothy head, diminishing slowly. Slightly hoppy, soapy aroma. Medium bodied. Malty with a firm hoppiness. Some caramel and diacetyl. Some dirtiness in the aftertaste.
Stepan Razin Spetsialnoe (Special);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);A sweet, toffee-ish aroma. A golden beer with almost non-lasting head. Some bitterness.
Stepan Razin Spetsialnoe (Special);St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);On draught at Balsjoj Festival Piva, Moscow. Golden color. Slightly sweet in flavor. Some hens-food aroma with notes of toffee...I had hopes for worse...
Stepan Razin Admiralteyskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);FTA: A strong, solid example of a good Russian pale lager. Not a Czech Pilsner, but rather a good Helles to my tongue.
Stepan Razin Admiralteyskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);"0.5 bottle. Pale yellow color; medium, white head on top, quite dense and stays for a while too. Hop aroma of pines and grass with some yeasty notes of leather. Taste is slightly bitter, composed mostly of hops and yeasts - very trite. Light body, thin texture and lively carbonation. Finish is short and uneventful. Overall the beer is a cliche in its own style besides the unusual fact of lacing; nothing to describe."
Stepan Razin Admiralteyskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Bottled Golden colour, O.K. head. Buttery aroma. Thin and watery with a faint buttery flavour and a lingering grassy bitterness.
Stepan Razin Admiralteyskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Not a bad beer to drink, but a little light to be a German Pilsener. It looks fine, golden with a creamy white head-soon-halo. The aroma is faint, biscuity with a hint of eastern hop bitterness. This is very soft in the mouth and tastes of sweet malts, grassy, with too light of a hopping. Okay, not great, but as the commercial description says, it’s an Ideal beverage to accompany cheeses or flavourful meats like smoked ham. I’m sure. Bridgeview Liquors, Bridgeview, IL
Stepan Razin Admiralteyskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Yay! I finally retrieved the ratings I lost when I dropped my handheld... by getting another handheld. .5 L bottle, rated in St. Petersburg, 6/8/04. Sometimes I feel I’m overrating these Russian beers just because they don’t offend completely, are very cheap, or are kind of refreshing after a long walk. This one will not get that treatment, although it’s pretty much the same. Opens to another lager yeast smell (flash pasteurization?) that detracts from the rest of the beer experience. Color is closer to a pilsener style, so this is close to being okay. But I had a genuine Budweiser Budvar on draft at the St.P airport a week before, and I know what a pilsener should be. For one thing, it should have hops. This doesn’t.
Stepan Razin Admiralteyskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Pale gold color with a thin white head. The aroma is bread with some slight flowers and dust. The taste is a full corn with some green beans and honey. There is also a hint of corn. This is not a very good version of the style. I have enjoyed some other beers from this brewer.
Stepan Razin Admiralteyskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Golden color with a small white head. Dry malt aromas along with a hint of chalk and light floral hops. Grainy, bready, chalky flavors. Really not bad. Really just OK.
Stepan Razin Admiralteyskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);Golden and disturbingly hazy--no infection though and no head either. This is pretty typical for pale Russian lagers which is to say it’s too far on the sweet side and just generally crappy. Notes of hay, grass, cereal grains and the unspeakable.
Stepan Razin Admiralteyskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);"50 cL bottle, paper bag, snifter. Wet hay, grain, cereal malt (M); earthy hops (L); honey and light DMS aromas. Light gold body. Short, white, fizzy head is quickly diminishing. Moderately sweet, moderately acidic flavor becomes a lightly acidic, moderately bitter finish. Grainy flavor throughout. Medium light body, watery/chalky texture, lively carbonation. The bottom line is: well, it really does taste like a pilsener, just not a good one."
Stepan Razin Admiralteyskoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);(Bottled) Pale yellow color with a smallish head. Grassy, hoppy, slightly metallic aroma. Slightly sweet honey flavor with hints of metal, and a reasonable amount of malt and hops. Smooth-carbonated, light to medium-bodied palate. Quite nice, but somewhat metallic pilsener.
Stepan Razin Studencheskoye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);Pale yellow. Terrible smell of burning rubber. Thin, metallic taste. Ovewhelming revolting, chemical, gassy aftertaste - artificial rotten eggs?. Definitely one of the worst beers in the world.
Stepan Razin Studencheskoye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);Ah yes, Studencheskoye. The minute the rotten vegetable aroma jumped out of the glass, I knew I was on to something. The palate - like taking a bucket of industrial chemicals, dumping them on a compost heap, then burning the bucket.
SR Zenit 1984;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);Deep golden. Dryish with hints of apple and metal. Well hoppped and bitter.
SR Zenit 1984;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);This Vienna style is one of the more respectable of St. Petersburg's remarkably bland mainstream beers.
Stepan Razin Krepkoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Malt Liquor;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);FTA: a decent fortified lager. I was drinking when I was 16 during December 2000 cold frozen starry night. This must be ticked and noted.
Stepan Razin Krepkoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Malt Liquor;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);This beer is all about sweet and sour malt and alcohol. In every way horrible disgusting! I’d rather drink pure alcohol than this beer!
Stepan Razin Krepkoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Malt Liquor;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);"(br-btl br-lbl, ""first Russian brewery 1795) lct-cpr, thin head, med-body, §co2. §dusty §malty §hoppy aroma, malty T1 §dusty T2 warm fruity T3."
Stepan Razin Krepkoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Malt Liquor;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);I can see why this was $2 now. Clear golden colour, large head that carries a noticeably strong alcohol aroma. Taste is creamy, unbalanced malt character. and a taste that is strong in alcohol also.

Southend Bombay Pale Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;This was called Castle Pale Ale. It looks like thier APA has nmany different names. The alcohol was slightly higher at 5.5%. Served in pint glass the head was small and dissapoated. I liked the deep copper color. Good bitterness with some light citrus. The finish was smooth with some bitterness. This was downtown Cahrleston in three stories..
Southend Bombay Pale Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Clear and yellow with no head. Faint aroma of nothing worth mentioning. Pretty boring and bland all around. Watery. Not good.
Southend Bombay Pale Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Draft at brewer. By far the best beer here tonight. Pours a copper with a thin white head. Malty/hoppy floral scent and a blanced taste.
Southend Bombay Pale Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Amber with light aromas of wet paint. Palate confirms nose. Light hoppiness and long finish. Too long--wet paint beer is not good.
Southend Bombay Pale Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;On tap at Southend Brewpub in Charleston S.C. The aroma contains notes of floral hops and the flavor is extremely floral and fruity without. A little sweet but finishes with a moderate bitterness.
Southend Bombay Pale Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Lasting , minute-bubbled head provides a curtain of lace. Amber color and nearly clear. Good blend of light colored malts and floral hop. The taste is more hoppy than the smell. Bitter aftertaste. A solid pale ale whose only demerit is the thin body.
Southend Bombay Pale Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;An.amber pour with a small head. Good mild hop aroma. Light but abundant lacing. Slight burnt walnut character. Pucker mouthfeel. That darned apllejuice bitter sweet backend. Shallow finish
Southend Bombay Pale Ale;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;This was the best of the lineup. There was ample head with excellent retention. A very fresh hop aroma. The hops come across with a bit of an orange smell. There is a lingering hop bite, but it’s only moderate at best. Still a standout in this lineup. It was a good pairing with the shrimp and grits on the menu.
Southend Carolina Blonde;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Draught at the brewery. Pours light copper. Smells breaddy. Tastes watery with some floral hints.

Southend Carolina Blonde;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;No head, but there is Belgian lace on the glass. Straw color and nearly clear. Dry, light adjunct smell. This continues in the flavor which is strongly dry. Thin malt flavor and no hop. The aftertaste is odd, beyond my ability to describe. The body is very thin and highly carbonated.
Southend Carolina Blonde;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Tasted at the Southend Brewery & Smokehouse in Charleston SC - pours a golden color with no head. Aroma of grass and wheat - like the light it tasted of corn and SLIGHTLY less of dirty sock. Still not a great beer but not quite as offensive as the light version.
Southend Carolina Blonde;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;A darker yellow pour with a small white head. Iron powder aroma. Dirty wood flavor. Tastes like amdro? Mild bite. Can’t even finish the sample.

Southend Oktoberfest;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Crystal clear amber lager with good retention and decent lacing. The nose is of fruit, with notes of cat piss, honey, cinnamon and nutmet. I had a cold, so maybe, just maybe, that wasn't cat piss I smelled. Perfectly balanced flavor. It mirrors the aroma. Medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and mild carbonation. Lengthy, lightly bitter finish.
Southend Oktoberfest;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Draft at the Southend Brewery in Jacksonville. This beer had a small sized off-white head with fine-small sized bubbles that mostly diminished. The body was carbonated and transparent with an orange hue. The nose was hoppy and the flavor of this beer was that of mild-moderate hoppiness. The palate was tingly and a bit dry. This was a medium bodied beer with excellent lacing.
Southend Oktoberfest;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 46. This draft brew was enjoyed at the brewery in Jacksonville Florida. This brew poured a small head of off-white colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a carbonated orange brown colored body and a very nice laceing. The aroma was also a nice one with a good caramel malt presence. The mouthfeel was tingly though it diminished in the finish where the mild hop bite took over. The flavor was nicely malted with a smattering of hops. Overall, it was quite nice and very enjoyable.
Southend Oktoberfest;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Had at the brewpub in Jacksonville. Has a decent, light copper appearance and a sweet, slightly nutty aroma. The head is off-white with good lacing. Solid malty-sweet undertones in the flavor. Overall, a solid brewpub seasonal - noting to write home about.
Southend Oktoberfest;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Dry. A little more orange than their pale ale. Very lightly hopped. No aroma to speak of. Palate thin. Lackluster. Rerate 2003 Grainy lager aroma. Dry, nutty, some notion of mayonnaise. Long woody finish. Decent hopping. An improvement over the 2002 batch.
Southend Ironman Wheat;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Pours yellow with a white head. Smells of light citrus. Tastes of citrus, some grainy wheat.
Southend Ironman Wheat;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Draft at brewer. Pours a cloudy yellow with a thin white head. Scent is sweet honey and wheaty. Taste is wheat.
Southend Ironman Wheat;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;A pretty average wheat beer with some hints of spice and orange - nothing special, but not bad either.
Southend Ironman Wheat;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;"On tap at the charleston brewery. Pours a cloudy orange with no head. Sweet malt aroma; yeasty wheat malt taste. Very refreshing with a slice of orange."
Southend Ironman Wheat;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;This is a mild wheat beer--not much nose and light taste. The beer settles to have no head (just some bubbles along the rim). Leaves streaky lace. The color is orange-amber and predictably cloudy. The smell and taste are similar--light wheat background with notes of beery and citric sourness (very mild). The body was true to the style, although the carbonation was on the high side.
Southend Ironman Wheat;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Tasted at the Southend Brewery & Smokehouse in Charleston SC - this brew poured a hazy orangish color - aroma was citrus (they stuck an orange in it so not sure if I smelled the beer or the orange), hops and wheat. Taste of orange, spice and wheat. Average brew.
Southend Ironman Wheat;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;This beer was a cloudy gold, but somehow managed to have no head, odd for a wheat beer. Despite having heard of problems with some of the Southend beers from raters who’d been there as recently as a month ago, this is the only beer that showed any signs of off flavors. It tasted like it could be a bit old.
Southend Ironman Wheat;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Hazy straw light white head very smooth and not much clove or banana. Which is to my liking. Crisp finish with a slight medicinal tone.
Southend Ironman Wheat;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Draft. Citrus, but almost no nose on this lighty hazy straw colored beer. Banana and apple flavors. Refreshing, decent enough flavor, but really watery. Seems to be the trend at this place.
Southend Ironman Wheat;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;One of the better brews I had at Southend, which seems to be quite the hit-or-miss place when it comes to their brews. I wouldn’t call it a hefeweizen so much as an American Wheat Ale. GLAD that they didn’t serve it with any kind of citrus wedge (I have a particular disdain for that tradition...). Definite hints of apple and other bright fruit in the nose. Goes down smooth and refreshingly. I’d have another.
Southend Carolina Light Blonde;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Draft at brewer. Kinda like the blonder only weaker. A clear straw color. Scent not there. Taste is sweet malt and thin.
Southend Carolina Light Blonde;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;"Draught at the brewpub. You know it’s gonna be good when the bartender jokingly says ""Tell me how close to water we got it"" when serving it to me. Pours a very light straw greenish yellow with small white head. The aroma is kind of mildewy with some grain and wet shoes. The flavor is weird graininess, shoes again, and a hint of lemon. Bland, but fair enough for what it is."
Southend Carolina Light Blonde;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;The taste is almost stale upfront, but the aftertaste is reminiscent of Coors Light.
Southend Carolina Light Blonde;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Light yellow. Medium yeasty and metallic aroma. Light on palate with a metallic taste and weird creamy finish. Not great.
Southend Carolina Light Blonde;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;"Not much head, but there was good lace on the glass. Straw color and hazy. The aroma is off; it reminds me of a Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic--like a malty Sweettart. There must be a high percentage of adjuncts in this beer. It tastes grainy with absolutely no hop to the tongue. Lots of carbonation and quite watery. Overall, a definite miss."
Southend Carolina Light Blonde;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Tasted at the Southend Brewery & Smokehouse - pale yellow pour, no head - grassy, wheat aroma - taste of corn and dirty socks. Not a very good beer.

Southend Carolina Light Blonde;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;This is by far the palest of the beers offered. The flavor has a light straw malt and a slight citrus note, but this is definitely on the watery side.
Southend Carolina Light Blonde;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Draft. Light yellow, big bubbles. Lemons and a hint of bitterness in the aroma. Refreshing enough finish with nearly no body. A very boring, but not terrible micro-light.
Southend Carolina Light Blonde;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Southend Brewery & Smokehouse;Tap. Sweet orange and malt aroma. Medium yellow with small head. Sweet malt flavor with a light hops finish. A very nice light beer.

Watson Brothers Abigails Amber;Blue Ash, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Watson Bros. Bistro & Brewery;[on tap in Cincinnati airport] Flat, clear amber. Raisin, dark malts, sweet cherries, port, lifesavers candy = aroma. Raisin, fruity toffee = flavour. Significant bitterness. Medium body, low carbonation and a sweet finish. Almost an altbier.
Watson Brothers Abigails Amber;Blue Ash, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Watson Bros. Bistro & Brewery;Light toasted malt nose - really light, amber color, low clingy head. Weak roasted malt body with a sugary sweetness in the middle. Oaky finish, some hop character. Thin and vapid, really, with a quick profile. Not very good.
Watson Brothers Abigails Amber;Blue Ash, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Watson Bros. Bistro & Brewery;It was served by a waiter so it had no head. It was much darker and stronger than would expect from an amber. Nice malt flavor and a good hop finish.

Dark amber hue with a medium white head that diminished quickly. Medium aroma of malt and caramel. Medium body with creamy texture. Well balanced flavor of malt and caramel with small bite at finish. Earlier Rating: 5/13/2005 Total Score: 3 Draft in sampler set in Blue Ash. Poured a dark brown with a medium rocky off-white head. Aroma and flavor was a small malt with short sweet finish.

Watson Brothers Abigails Amber;Blue Ash, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Watson Bros. Bistro & Brewery;Had one of these on tap at Watson Bros Bistro & Brewery last night in Cincy prior to the Tool show. Nose of caramel, toasted malt and flowers. Medium ruddy brown with a creamy mostly diminishing white head and fair lacing. Low acidity, good balance with a medium finish. Medium creamy and smooth soft body with a slightly alcoholic feel to the finish. Very nice if you like 'em a bit on the sweet side.
Watson Brothers Abigails Amber;Blue Ash, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Watson Bros. Bistro & Brewery;I believe this is the beer that is sold at Montgomery Inn in Cincy as Ted's Red. It has a light amber color and a soft hop nose. The flavor begins with a pleasant dose of hops but fades quickly with no real malt presence.
Watson Brothers Main Street Pale Ale;Blue Ash, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Watson Bros. Bistro & Brewery;On Tap. At the Cincinnati airport Watson Brothers.

Watson Brothers Main Street Pale Ale;Blue Ash, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Watson Bros. Bistro & Brewery;[on tap in Cincinnati airport] Almost clear copper with a thin island and ring of head. Caramel and subtle diacetyl aroma with a touch of US hops. Average american pale ale for flavour: nice pine/citrus with subdued crystal malt and limited fruitiness. Medium to light body with moderate carbonation and a lingering bitterness.
Watson Brothers Main Street Pale Ale;Blue Ash, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Watson Bros. Bistro & Brewery;Hop aroma is the best part of this beer. Unfortunately the rest is not so great. Over the past year the quality of EVERY WB ale has severly suffered. There’s a problem in every beer this brewpub offers. I had a sampler recently and every beer suffers from the same defect. It’s either an infection in dirty beer lines or their yeast is producing a powerful off-flavor: Diacetyl. It’s distinct in this and particularly their Amber. I dislike even writing this because the beer scene in Cincinnati suburbs is POOR at best. I want WB to survive.

Watson Brothers Main Street Pale Ale;Blue Ash, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Watson Bros. Bistro & Brewery;Consumed at the Cincinnati airport on tap. What luck I thought in finding a Brew pub in the airport. This was a sad mistake. Red amber color with no head. Aroma is just a little skanky, sort of like Juliette Lewis. Thin bodied.

Watson Brothers Tobys New Zealand Dark;Blue Ash, Ohio, United States;Porter;Watson Bros. Bistro & Brewery;I’m surprised that this is a porter! I would rate it as a dunkel. LIght, roasted grain flavor with a slight chocolate overtone. No head (it was served by a waiter, they have a tendency to fill the pint glass to the rim at the expense of the head). It was flat. It had a nice hop finish. I wouldn’t go back for another one.

Watson Brothers Tobys New Zealand Dark;Blue Ash, Ohio, United States;Porter;Watson Bros. Bistro & Brewery;Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. I was not very impressed with this beer, as it really didn''t come across as a Porter to me when I tried it. The beer poured a dark but bubbly clear brown. Roasted malty aroma and it actually tasted kind of like a Dunkel with a sweet malt finish. I think it needs to pack more punch.

Moylans Kilt Lifter Scotch Ale;Novato, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Moylans Brewery & Restaurant;A robust malt bomb of a beer with tons of smoky malt and leatheriness. Pours a very pretty striking mahogany with a sticky beige head. It does one thing, but it does it very well. Ample alcohol kick, but not hot, and drinks a bit a lighter than its ABV would imply. Worthy of several pints.
Moylans Kilt Lifter Scotch Ale;Novato, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Moylans Brewery & Restaurant;Copenhagen 16/10 2019. 47,3 cl can from Mad & Vin, Magasin, Kbh. K. Green and Orange version of Moylan's usual compact design. Pours murky, muddy Maroon with an orange hue. Small Off-white head. Settles as a small patch of lonely foam not nearly covering the surface of the beer. No lacing. Aroma is medium-intense and caught between the sweet and slightly candy-like and the salty. Sweet malts. Caramel with a touch of sugar. Raisins. Touch of Salt Water. Quite strong carbonation. Slightly thick, watery, tingling texture. Flavor is quite sweet followed by a more moderate bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet with a light sourish bitter undertone. Very light touch of metal. Semi-dry finish. Despite being on the sweet side it avoids being cloying - maybe due to the salty and dry touch. And the name may not be subtle - but it is amusing.

Moylans Wheat Berry;Novato, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Moylans Brewery & Restaurant;(22 oz bottle: $2.80 at Moylan’s Brewery in Novato, CA) What is with these guys? So many of their bottles are severely over carbonated. Despite a very careful pour, I still ended up with a complete glass of foam. Hell, there’s even an inch of foam topping the beer INSIDE THE BOTTLE now. I may as well go rate another beer and come back to this one after the head dies down. {Rated Abita Purple Haze} Okay, I’m back, and the head has receded to a very bubbly, quarter inch layer atop the beer. For quite some time, the frenetic rush of carbonation bubbles as they raced to the surface was quite a sight. Unfortunately, the wait wasn’t worth it. The berry flavor of this beer is lightly tart, and lightly sweet, but isn’t especially fruity and tastes artificial and plasticy to me. Since the berry is the overwhelming flavor, it’s hard to get past it. The wheat flavor in the background seems pretty standard. Mild hops bitterness isn’t especially noticeable until the finish, where it’s barely noticeable. The nose matches the tart berry and wheat flavor. The palate is (obviously) highly carbonated, and the beer is light to medium in body. Light golden color with a modest haziness on the early pours, but the final pour releases a good amount of sediment from the bottom of the bottle, so the beer shows lots of suspended particles. The foamy head is off-white, but with all that foam, there is no lacing since it just slides right down the glass, returning to surface of the beer. Not a bad beer, I mean, it’s okay, but if you’re gonna make a boisenberry wheat beer where the berry dominates, at least make it fruity.
Moylans Wheat Berry;Novato, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Moylans Brewery & Restaurant;Looks like an American Hefeweizen, but has the flavor of a great soft fruit beer. The fruit is nicely balanced with the wheat and is a great starter or finish beer for your meal at the brewpub.
Moylans Wheat Berry;Novato, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Moylans Brewery & Restaurant;WOW this smells exactly like some skunky blue berry chronic and has a real fruity scent none like i have none in the past. It looks like a hefeweizen in the glass but don’t be fooled. I was fooled and wondering how they pulled off lacing berry flavors and not making the beer as sweet as it smells.

St. Sebastiaan Dark;Meer, Belgium;Dubbel;Brouwerij Sterkens;From the “jug”. Pours brown with a voluminous beige head that slowly settles. Aroma is overall quite mild but a bit vinous with notes of tea and caramel. Taste is mildly bittersweet with hints of toffee lingering on the tongue. Dry at the end. Body stays fairly light, carbonation is mild. Easy drinking without the complexity of some Dubbels but pleasant enough.
St. Sebastiaan Dark;Meer, Belgium;Dubbel;Brouwerij Sterkens;Bottle, 500 ml. Another very poor beer considering it should be extraordinary. It's not. Actually it's very poor. Weak on the nose, dull on the palate, it's just not a good one. R u kiddin' me? Below average...

St. Sebastiaan Dark;Meer, Belgium;Dubbel;Brouwerij Sterkens;500ml ceramic bottle from the Offie, Leicester. Packaging is over the top but the beer itself is rather attractive: cola brown, slightly translucent with a loose khaki head. Light nutty aroma with some liquorice and sweet spice. Sweet taste with enough of a balance to give it character. Again there’s a nutty note in the fairly short finish. Very heavily carbonated, which works for the light body.

Harveys 1859 Porter (Bottle);Lewes, East Sussex, England;Porter;Harveys Brewery;500 ml bottle at the Royal Oak. First new MJ 500 tick of this trip. Pitch black with a talll, bubbly head. Nose is chocolate, light coffee, a bit of soy sauce. Soft and chocolatey flavor, not sweet, minerals, grassy hop, lightly roasted. Very nice, easy drinking, wth huge flavors. The hops are noticeable, the roast not too much, and not too sweet. I would say that this is still a representative British porter.

Hazy, reddish brown pour with a one finger, tan head. Excellent floral hoppiness in then nose.

Alcatraz Big House Red;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alcatraz Brewing Company;On tap (from sampler) at Alcatraz Brewing Co, Indianapolis. Reddish colour - pretty much the same as the Irish American Red which I had a t the same time.

Alcatraz Big House Red;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alcatraz Brewing Company;tap in Indy - Pours amber and laces nicely. It has a mild caramel malt aroma. The flavor is caramel malt with light hops. It’s light bodied and overall too bland once again.

Bear Republic India Pale Ale;Healdsburg, California, United States;IPA;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Tap at Bobbique. Not very IPAish, but the hops are present enough to count.

Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale;Healdsburg, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Backlog on tap in Philly, pours a dark red color with a small to medium beige head.

Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale;Healdsburg, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Draft at Hair of the Dog - Phrom Phong in Bangkok. Pours a deep golden reddish-brown, opaque, with a one finger head that lingers, with lacing. Not much aroma - a hint of malt, slight soapy scent. First sip is deep malty flavour balanced with bitter hops - low carbonation, palate is a bit oily. Good residual hop flavour. With continued consumption, the malt recedes a bit, and the hops come to the front - and stay beyond the end. The palate is less thick than the colour would suggest. This was a pretty good ale - I think it just uses hops that are not my favourites.
Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale;Healdsburg, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bear Republic Brewing Company;$1.49 bottle from Rio Hill Wine. Pours red and hazy with a beige head.

Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale;Healdsburg, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bear Republic Brewing Company;From Mar 2008 I got this in a trade with goaliepride. Thanks Michael! It pours a hazy(that turns cloudy after the first pour) reddish brown with a good 2 finger head of foam. A couple of minutes into the session and there's a lot of shrinkage but there's still a solid layer in my glass and there's some good lacing. The smell is nice and hoppy(citrus) and has a faint roasted malt nose. The taste on first sip and I'm getting a lot hoppy goodness...citrus and pine dominate. A few more sips in and I start to notice the malt, both roasted and caramel, and it brings some nice balance to this Red Ale. Tasty stuff here. It has a pretty full mouthfeel to it for a Red, the carbonation is medium light, and it finishes slightly bitter with some bready tones. Very easy to drink and really satisfying. A top notch example of the style, me thinks. I'm glad I have another bottle but I know it won't be long before I pop the cap on *that* one.
Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale;Healdsburg, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Beautiful pour.. murky brown, huge foamy tan head. Slight malt on aroma... overall pretty neutral there. Taste is sweet, bitter, malt.
Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale;Healdsburg, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Claimed to be a malty Scottish style, but I’m missing that caramel component.

Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale;Healdsburg, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bear Republic Brewing Company;15/20 reminds me of the founders dirty bastard, not quite as chocolatey, but an ale that’s a good mix of malt, bitterness and chocolate. Very good

It’s a deep brownish amber, clear with a magnificent off-white head. Lovely aroma: cherries, a touch of cinnamon, some glorious resinous esters. Sweet taste at first but the hoppy bitterness creates a barrier of dryness. Chocolate berry notes with an almost patchouli note in the aftertaste. Carbonation is extremely high. A magnificent creation.

Light tan cap of a head that looked like it had been painted on top of the brew. Great retention and curtains of lacing throughout the sample. Pretty muted aromas; some dry roasted maltiness and perhaps a whiff of some dark fruits....not much going on here. Roasted maltiness, but not overly so. Hint of graininess, and a very dry finish. Smooth, creamy, but at the same time quite a light body. Satisfying in all the right ways, and very much expected for what I would want in the style. Overall, more than worth a look and was a nice break from the extreme."

Bear Republic Black Bart Stout;Healdsburg, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Bear Republic Brewing Company;I found this to be reminiscent of the Samuel Smith’s RIS.

Bear Republic Black Bart Stout;Healdsburg, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Tap at the Blind Tiger. Man I just love this style, what can I say. A good dry stout on nitro simply can’t be beat (and no, I’m not talking about that bullshit Guinness). This beer has a subtle but delicious homemade cookie and chocolate aroma, smooth and silky, with lots of cacao nibs. Smooth, perfect body, dry and creamy, lightly chalky, more fresh cookie. Excellent.

Bear Republic Heritage Ale;Healdsburg, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bear Republic Brewing Company;On tap @ Rattle N Hum. This is a darker looking one deeper ruby looking in color with a nice big lasting and leaving small dots down the glass off-white head. Surprisingly mild aroma. Expected a big punchy nose, didnt get that. Is a subtle softly dark caramel sweet one. Traces of nuts and earth. Tastes really good.

It has a mild sticky kinda oily texture in the mouth and its creamy prickling on the bubbles. Lots of red berries like cranberries and freeze dried raspberries. Lots of flavor, and thank god its not too sweet. Like it quite a lot. 17.06.2015

Bear Republic Heritage Ale;Healdsburg, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Draught at Apex, Portland, as Bear Republic Heritage Wee Heavy, 8.1% ABV Dark mahogany color.

Chouffe Bok 6666;Achouffe, Belgium;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Brasserie d'Achouffe (Duvel-Moortgat);"Sparkling clear ruby dark-brown pour with beige head; decent retention. Aroma is weak; faint dark malts, maybe some dark fruit. Taste is medium sweet, with some sense of licorice and candy, far away maybe some chocolate. Mwah, not so convinced; this candy-ish element is not at it's place."
Chouffe Bok 6666;Achouffe, Belgium;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Brasserie d'Achouffe (Duvel-Moortgat);"Aroma is metallic, slight hint of dark fruits and spice. Taste has a slight roasty tang, with hints of raisins. Has typical spice tones produced by Belgian yeast in the background. Very low body for a bock beer. Fairly dry. Taste dissapears quickly. Carbonation is average. Overall: not bad but still pretty dissapointing; would have expected better from La Chouffe."

Buzzards Bay Lager;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Hazy golden pour. Nose is surprisingly clear. A soft malt aroma with a kiss of light hops still coming through. A bit of age showing although the hopping is still there. Crisp and clean although certainly a little bit simple.
Buzzards Bay Lager;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Pale yellow pour. Crisp slightly hoppy malt taste. Beer is better than overproduced macros, but not all that great. Rated 3/25/04
Buzzards Bay Lager;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Gold with fluffy white head and lace. Sour, papery, light malt and good bitter. Thin but with good carbonation. Not as good as the 2.7 would indicate.

Buzzards Bay Lager;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Courtesy jcwattsrugger - Thanks!Mildly cloudy orange, no head. lots of corn in the aroma, also kinda sour.

Buzzards Bay Lager;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Clear golden color. Aroma is of malts, a little bit of skunk, yeast, lactose, and some earthiness. Flavor is a little bit of a metallic flavor, hops, malts, and yeast. It has a little bit of malty metallic aftertaste. This might be skunked so that will alter the rating. RIP Buzzards Bay.
Buzzards Bay Lager;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Pale yellow. Light malt, touch of honey on the aroma. Flavor matches, with hop bitterness onthe finish. Little else.
Buzzards Bay Lager;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Bottle from Maniac’s Richmond Tenth Gathering. Clear golden pour with wispy white head.

Buzzards Bay Stock Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;12oz bottle: I didn’t realize that this one had been retired. It pours a cloudy brown color with a bit of head, which drops off rather quickly. The aroma is good, but a tad light. Notes of toffee and caramel malts. Possibly some raisins also. The taste is OK. Somewhat sweet, with some roastiness and dryness in the aftertaste. Not bad. Why did they kill this one?
Buzzards Bay Stock Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;This beer came to me in my beer club. I am not familiar with the brewer. Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a dark brown color with a medium sized dark tan head. The aroma is molasses, maple syrup and light roasty malts. The flavor is molasses, raisin and moderate roasty malts. A rather nice beer.
Buzzards Bay Stock Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;12 oz bottle. Reddish brown color, clear, medium head. The aroma has a big caramel character. Woah, the flavor has an interesting burnt flavor with a good deal of bitterness. Okay, so I like burnt flavors. The carbonation stayed around so that was nice, too. Interesting & good beer, try one.
Buzzards Bay Stock Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;"Clear, deep mahogany/brown with a small, tan head. Aroma holds pronounced caramel & oak with broth and an ""oily"" quality. Thin mouthfeel. Flavor is smoky with caramel malt flavor leading to a dirty, dry finish. Single bottle from Cornfield’s cellar."
Buzzards Bay Stock Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;"Like a soup that has only boiled a few min... the hops were there the malts were there but very dishwattery.

Buzzards Bay Stock Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;pours out of the bottle a deep ruddy-brown. minimal tan head. smells of hops, malts, wood, caramel and florals. tastes strongly of caramel and roasted malts. started out sweet but finished slightly bitter. dried out my mouth. overall the flavors were not well-balanced or appealing.
Buzzards Bay Stock Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;This amber ale pours a dark brown color from a 12 oz bottle. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is floral, earthy and sweet, a touch perfumy. A medium to light bodied amber ale. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are grapefruity and slightly bitter. Pretty much tastes like your typical brew pub amber ale. Perhaps a bit watery and a little sweet, but still very drinkable. Mouthfeel is a touch thin. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Buzzards Bay Stock Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Pours a dark copper color with mild white head. Aroma big on caramel, toffee, some roasted malts teamed up with a nice hint of hop. Flavor has a weird candy thing going on for it, maybe it reminded me of something I’d eaten before.

Buzzards Bay Stock Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;"Not terrible, but my sample had a strange ""dusty"" aftertaste.

Buzzards Bay Golden Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Pale yellow orangish pour. Nose and taste is very bland burnt maltish hops. Just okay. Rated 3/27/04
Buzzards Bay Golden Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;August 2008 Beer of the Month Club (Rating is from 9/2/08) Overall Impression: Pretty dark and bitter for a golden, but lacking any exceeding flavor characteristics, just not a whole lot there.
Buzzards Bay Golden Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;"I am reminded of the smell I get from pouring an upstate NY lager like Matt’s or Genesee. A touch of hop, a slight, slight note of all spice or clove Golden to amber in color, the beer produces a modest head that decreases to a thin layer of bubbles within 2 minutes. Very clear. Very nice pale malt flavor that lasts well into the aftertaste. Midway, I sense a subtle hop, but this is a predominately malty ale, although it is more crisp than most. While thinner than most beers I consume, it is reasonably full-bodied. I wouldn’t necessarily clamor for more; but I would easily take another at a tailgate on a warm September afternoon."
Buzzards Bay Golden Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Got this in the beer of the month (Aug beer) gift my wife gave me. Poured a clear burnt orange color, no head and very little carbonation. Aroma is very low but a bit of a burnt malt aroma seeps through mixed with a semi-hallertauer hops aroma. The flavor is pretty bland being mostly a light roasted flavor at the end and nothing really in between. An ok brew but really plain.
Buzzards Bay Golden Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Sampled a while back. Let me start by saying I had Buzzard’s Bay Lager and this seems to taste just like it. Bright golden, color, very clear and topped with a pretty nice head. Somewhat sweet, smooth with a mild aftertaste. Grainy and not all that flavorful. It goes down fine, isn’t a bad beer but seems way too much like their Lager. Maybe that’s why it was retired.
Buzzards Bay Golden Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;12 oz. bottle gift from a friend - Pours a clear golden color with a thin white head. Light carbonation. Very light spotty lacing. Has a grain and herbal hop aroma. Smells kinda skunky too. Light sweet grain malt and hop flavor. Thin palate and light body. Slight oxidation noticeable. This beer was a year past its prime. I doubt it was much better when fresh. Thanks Mike
Buzzards Bay Golden Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Better than the macros but not by much. Herbal hops present. Light in the palate but refreshing. Unremarkable.
Buzzards Bay Golden Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Very pale yellow that was mild and easy to drink. A bit light for my taste but a well balanced and smooth beer.
Buzzards Bay Golden Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Very clear pale golden color with a sticky-lacing thin white head. Very mild, lightly sweet and floral hoppy aroma has some grainy notes. Thin, watery body has some grainy pale malty sugars, soft carbonation and light earthy hoppy bitterness. A very drinkable beer and fairly true to style, but bland and uninteresting.
Buzzards Bay Golden Ale;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buzzards Bay Brewing;12oz bottle acquired in trade jjppm74 (thanks!). Poured a lighter and see through yellow color with an averaged sized white head. Lighter aromas of spices and grass. Flavors of the same. Thin and watery.

Jacobins Kriek;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);[Bottle (330ml)] Pours a nice-looking deep ruby with an average size lasting frothy pinkish head. Pleasant aroma (7+) of black cherries along with malt in the back -- more sweet than tart. Lightly tart black cherry flavour with malt in the back and just a hint of vinegar. Average bodied. Nice Flemish.

There are sweet cherries to the fore in this one, there is a little sourness, tanginess going on but it is more fruit juice than most for me.

The aroma was black cherry, yeast and cola. The flavor was very tart and sour with cherry, yeast and cola. Very long finish. Medium body.
Jacobins Kriek;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Clear, beautiful ruby color, small non lasting ring off white head.

Jacobins Kriek;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Bottle from the lcbo. Aroma lacks much character, it's watery cherry, with some minerals and light tin. Mouth feel is OK, carb is standard. Finish is quite tart actually, with a sweet cherry finish.
Jacobins Gueuze;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Old review, only really have a score from a Brussels trip long ago. from memory, a relatively mild and simple sour.
Jacobins Gueuze;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Bottle - 10 months past bb. Rosy amber with a beige head that's soon less than a coat. Weird aroma of a laundry left mid-clean, paper, apple peel. Quite sour with an acidic finish. No sign of any sweetness.Taste is better with some apples and cherries but not much funk. The aroma clears a bit after a while and it's better as it warms a bit ( a lesson I should have learned from previous Jacobins beers). Presumably something very like this beer is what gets softened up and rounded out in (the lovely) Cuvée des Jacobins. Interesting.
Jacobins Gueuze;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Bottle @ home. Thanks for bringing the bottle dad! Clear medium orange color, average sized white head. Smell and taste are quite nice: lightly green apple peel and unripe citrus fruit, mixed in a way that it provides a slight sweet background, a slight tart / dry note and a light, but dominant sour yet fruity flavor. Quite nice and perhaps also worth noticing: it's super cheap.
Jacobins Gueuze;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Fles 25cl thuis. Zuren en zoeten in balans, licht sprankelend. Valt mee voor een gueuze. (10-2017).

Jacobins Gueuze;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Bottle at home, THT25.10.2017. Murky golden colour, almost clear topped by an offwhite foamy head. Base-for-oudbruin more than strictly gueuze, quite malty and almost cherry fruity, light-medium acidity, funk and tardness, medium dry finish. Medium body, low carbonation.
Jacobins Gueuze;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Ácida, porém com sabor intenso, pouca espuma, pouco alcoólica, pouco corpo, muito boa.
Jacobins Gueuze;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Bottle - pours orange with a white head. Aroma is tartwith some sweet malt and funk. Taste is confised mix of tart and sweet w8th a veg finish.
Jacobins Gueuze;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Pours clear amber with low white head. Aroma of mild grass and grapes, light citrus, and hints of bread, somewhat funky and off. Taste is medium tart, grassy with some grape notes, lightly citrusy. Tart through and through, somewhat one-dimensional. Light and crisp body with average carbonation.
Concord Grape Ale;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Concord Brewery;Had this under the name Rapscallions on tap. Pours orange with a little bit of head and some lacing. Aromas of apricot, berries and red grapes. Very light in the mouth, tastes were basically a light sweet. Nothing special.
Concord Grape Ale;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Concord Brewery;The first thing I noticed when I poured is that the aroma is Welch’s grape juice. Very strong. The taste is significantly weaker than the aroma, but still grape. Light to medium bodied. Rated 9/26/04
Concord Grape Ale;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Concord Brewery;Reviewing from memory - had this a couple years ago in Boston. Pours medium amber with a small white head. Aroma is pretty nice, with Concord grapes and a hint of pale/caramel malt. Flavor is pale/caramel malt, grains, and somewhat artificial-tasting grape juice. Bottle is a little thin and watery, especially for a winter seasonal. Falls a little short of expectations overall.
Concord Grape Ale;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Concord Brewery;on tap-pours a dissipating off white head and dark amber color. Aroma is wow, lots of purple grapes. Taste is purple grapes, secondary English malt, faint English hops-earthy/flat. OK carbonation.
Concord Grape Ale;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Concord Brewery;draft - Smells like grapes, imagine that... it tastes like a weak lager with a lot of grapes added. I certainly wouldn’t call it robust as the commercial description does. I found it thin and watery with too much grape flavor added to the decidedly lacklaster base ale. This rated higher than I expected here. I don’t get the appeal.
Concord Grape Ale;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Concord Brewery;On tap at the Connecticut Brew Fest. Amber with a slight white head. Nose is all Nehi grape soda! Good flavor, red grape at first, then a nice malty grainy flavor. Decent bitter finish. Good!
Concord Grape Ale;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Concord Brewery;Deep amber ale with a light white head. Aroma of grape kool-aid or pez candy. Fresh malt in mouth with rather artificial raisins. Light and watery. Mondial 2005.
Concord Grape Ale;Lowell, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Concord Brewery;Best before 10/2005 bottle consumed 9/6/2005. Deep orange-copper with a definite currant-colored sheen to it. Moderate sized bubbles rise quite vigorously creating a large, 2-finger beige head with good retention. Moderate lacing as well, despite the fact that the beer seems pretty heavily filtered. Strong grape juice aroma right away, but it dies off somewhat and some crystal-like maltiness are detectable on the tail-end. Grape candy, but not overly sugary. Bit of sweet cream and a dry yeastiness. Flavor is not what I am expecting. Dry, not at all sweet. Grape medicine on the end. I’m definitely getting coffee or compost notes. Lots of vanilla wafers, cookie crumbs and white dough. Low carbonation. Interesting and not overdone. Almost like they made it so dry because everyone it expecting it to be so sweet.
Crooked River Select Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);bottle - Pours yellowish and hazy with fine suspended yeast and a very thin head. It smells of yeast and a trace of citrus. The flavori s yeasty and malty. It’s light and avoids being too watery, so it’s a decent warm weather quaff but not something to seek out.
Crooked River Select Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Medium gold color. Small white foamy head. Aroma is bready malts, with a touch of sweetness. A medium bodied Dort/Helles. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are mild and slightly spicy. Light and refreshing. Crisp and clean. Mild flavor. Good lawn mower beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Crooked River Select Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);12 oz. bottle Just plain... unimpressive. The hop fragrance is slightly stale, although I can pick out the Hallertau. Quite thin, pale yellow, the sudsy white head diminishes rapidly - altogether lager-like. Certainly drinkable, and certainly acceptable, but doesn't quite make the grade.
Crooked River Select Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Light amber in color, small head that disappears quickly. Smell: average... this is beer, not liquid gold. Something funky about the taste. Reminded me somehow of eating stale pizza crust. Not horrid, but not my glass of beer. Mouthfeel was funky, almost scratchy... dunno how that can be, but whatever, that was my reaction. I'm no gonna drink this beer again, I don't care if it local. It's drinkable, but not worth it.
Crooked River Select Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Deep, lightly clouded amber pour with a nice off-white head. Aroma contains malt and slight hops as well. Smooth, somewhat citrusy yet slightly bitter taste. Very crisp finish. A fine brew by Crooked River!!
Crooked River Select Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);A nice average Helles, with a malty flavor and a clean finish. Actually, it tastes to me like their excellent ESB minus any bitterness. Locally brewed so it's always fresh. It doesn't floor me, but all-in-all a solid beer.
Crooked River Select Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);This sure seemed hopped up for a lager, even if it's not intended to be. Has a smoky flavor and smell, which wasn't bad, but not great, either. Thought it would finish badly, but it actually finished quite nicely. OK stuff.
Crooked River Select Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Not bad, but nothing extraordinary to note. Tastes like many other lagers that I've had. Decent.
Crooked River Select Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Great looking hazy golden colour with a nice thick white head. The aroma is very nice, with malty characteristics along with some english smelling hops and even some lemon thrown in the mix. An above average beer from the sight and smell alone. A thin taste with a good balance of malt and hops, but it was a bit watery. Some of the citrus from the aroma went into the taste and palate of the beer, but it was very subtle. The aftertaste is decent, but not very strong. Overall, the beer looks and smells better than it tastes, and evaluates to an average beer for the style. Worth a try if you are in the area where it is offered (which happens to be here in the Washington suburbs :-). I bought this twelve ounce bottle at Total Wine in Manassas, Virginia.
Crooked River Select Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);When poured into my glass, this beer had a medium sized white head with small-medium sized bubbles that was long lasting. The body was hazy with some carbonation observed and the hue was golden. I found the nose to be somewhat complex as I could not conclude what the nose was. The lacing with this beer was good on the sides of my glass. The flavor of this beer was malty and it had a smooth mouthfeel.
Crooked River Island Hops;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Wheat Ale;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);A summer wheat ale from crooked river. Served in a 12 oz. bottle. Specs: This Kristal wheat beer is only available from May to September. It is a great beer that disappears off store shelves quick, fast, and in a hurry. A lot of people must wait for this beer every year, because I have a hard time finding it some years. It pours out a beautiful golden color, with a tight white head of foam. The head slowly disappears, leaving a ring of bubbles around the rim of the glass. Aromas are of wheat malt, slightly lactic smelling. Hop aromas are prevalent, with an emphasis on aromatic hops. Tastes great, a slight acidity to it, with a hops bite that will take your breath away, especially when you get a fresh batch. Find some when you can, but don't buy it all up. Save some for the rest of us poor saps.
Crooked River Island Hops;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Wheat Ale;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Headache inducing wheat, but not a bad brew on the hole... strong taste like most CR beers. I like this one in small quantities.
Crooked River Island Hops;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Wheat Ale;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);A nice Crystal Weizen brew from Crooked River of Cleveland. This is a rare summer seasonal wheat beer that is both light and refreshing. Nice hops aroma and flavor from the Hallertau hops. The yeast provides complex flavors that are very enjoyable. I'm not normally a big weizen beer fan but this one caught me when I was thirsty and hot and I really enjoyed it.
Crooked River Island Hops;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Wheat Ale;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Big hop and malt nose, bad thing its a seasonal, good thing it stores well. Hop bit is big so not meant for beginners.
Crooked River Yuletide Ale;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);12oz bottle from jsquire.

Nice, standard spiced holiday ale.
Crooked River Yuletide Ale;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);(From the 2011 batch) Slight dark fruit aroma, with just a touch of spice. Pours a clear ruby red, with a thin off white head. Nice spice flavor, with a hint of cherry in the background. Very nice Christmas ale, a bit more fruit notes then most of the ones around Cleveland. This is one I’ll be recommending to others.
Crooked River Yuletide Ale;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);2002 bottle consumed 8/18/09. Pours a hazy brown with some protein globules floating about and a surprisingly well developed head. Smells of muted spice, roasted malt, some chocolate sneaking in, some fruity hints. Tastes of sweet and roasted malt, velvety, spicy, some dark fruity elements, a nice touch of cocoa present. This must have been an amazing beer when fresh. Even with 7 years on it, it is still drinking well.
Crooked River Yuletide Ale;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);03-Sep-06 (12 oz bottle: Obtained 21-Mar-05 in trade with jeffin7, thanks Jeff!) I’m becoming a believer that these spiced winter ales age wonderfully. I actually have two bottles of Yuletide Ale, and although pushing two years now, the beer is delicious! Malty, chocolaty, roasty, lightly spicy and a bit earthy and smoky. Spices are surprisingly subdued, perhaps diminished from the aging. Malts are moderately sweet, and with hops playing little role here and the roast not contributing much in the way of bitterness, the chocolaty malts really dominate. Perhaps there is a hint of butter in the background when the beer warms up, but even warm, it remains a tasty brew. Body is medium and carbonation is light. The malty nose is chocolaty and lightly sweet. The initially hazy, brown-colored body turns fairly clear once all the particles settle to the bottom. Small, light-tan head dissipates somewhat rapidly, leaving just a thin ring as a quiet remembrance. Very enjoyable, one of those pleasant cellaring surprises for me.
Crooked River Yuletide Ale;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Reddish-brown color and a tannish head. A spicy aroma and a decent finish.
Crooked River Yuletide Ale;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Reddish brown with an offwhite head and aromas of citrus, dark fruit, and malt. The flavor has some earthiness and spice accompanied by a bit of malt. Finish on the palate is slightly astringent.
Crooked River Yuletide Ale;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);"Reddish-brown body, slightly congealed looking in glass, with bubbly sediment. Head is eggnog colored, decently thick for being 3 years old or so, and very longlasting (till the last drop). Aroma is cherry, dates, malt of course, and snappy citrus hops. Fun! Taste is jampacked with flavor, nothing mild about the palate on this oldster. Heavy malt, plum, and dark cherries rounded out with caramel backdrop and lemony hops. Alcohol sizzle and caramel round out the aftertaste. Solid beer, deserves a better ranking. Picked this up in a ""discount"" crate (unfortunately, the date had worn off) at Chevy Chase Liquor and Beer, in our nation’s capital, Washington, DC."

Great Adirondack John Brown IPA;Lake Placid, New York, United States;IPA;Great Adirondack Brewing Co.;"I’ve been to the brewpub in Lake Placid and drank this beer (and others) on tap, but was pleased to see they are canning now, which saves me an hour’s trip, so I picked up a six-pack. Pours clear orange-amber. Two-finger white head dissipates after a few minutes to leave behind some lacing. Aroma is of blood orange, pine needles, and fresh-baked bread. Taste is hop-forward with the above-mentioned aromas becoming flavors. It’s medium-bodied with great mouthfeel; the hop resins coat the tongue. There’s a long, lingering bitterness. If I had to re-categorize this beer, I’d call it an amber IPA because there’s a fair amount of malt, too."

Great Adirondack Haystack Blonde Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Great Adirondack Brewing Co.;draft- not a fan, not much in the way of flavor which is probably why this is reccomended for newby’s to the craft brew scene.

Humboldt Hefeweizen;Arcata, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Humboldt Brewing Company;Bottle from store in North Park. Has a funky aroma associated with old expired beer. Huge chunks of dead yeast floating and a glowing yellow hue with small fizzy head. The flavor is a sweet malt mess with a lot of honey like flavors but this is just to old for me to enjoy.

Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Humboldt Hefeweizen;Arcata, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Humboldt Brewing Company;"I am sick and tired and I'm not gonna take it anymore. So many American brewers have the audacity of calling there piss yellow fizzy beers that retain no head and have little or no cloudiness a hefeweizen. This is not a hefeweizen; it's an American wheat beer and nothing more. At least SN has the common descency of calling their beer what it is. This is a poor American Wheat to. Sure it's refreshing but so is every wheat beer I've ever tried. Budweiser, on occassion, has been refreshing. If I'm gonna pay $7.99/sixer I better get something that is more than just refreshing. GRRR!"
Humboldt Hefeweizen;Arcata, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Humboldt Brewing Company;This may be an old bottle... some signs of age. It pours with a quick white head, is only slightly hazy golden. Is fruit estery with apricot bordering on citrus. The hops are more substantial than the Anchor Summer beer which this is obviously a relative of. I prefer this beer though the Anchor Summer had a nice touch of history to it while this one is distinctly a newer generation American wheat.
Humboldt Hefeweizen;Arcata, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Humboldt Brewing Company;A hazy golden hue. Big foamy head that quickly dissapears. Has the typical wheat aroma with malty sweetness. Just enough hops to give it that crisp finish. A decent Hefeweizen.

Humboldt Brown Hemp Ale;Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Humboldt Brewing Company (Total Beverage Solution);Poured into a mug, the appearance was a sturdy dark brown color with a finger’s worth of a light tan foamy head. Dissipated fairly easy to leave some light lingering stringy lace. The aroma had some roasted nuts, slight dark malts, some caramel/toffee qualities, light earthiness and some hay. The flavor leaned towards a dry malty sweetness. Light bitterness came in for a decent balance. The aftertaste was somewhat malty and dry with a nice woody dry sort of finish. The feel was about medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt fine. It’s dry yet somewhat smooth. Overalll, one of the drier brown ales on the market. Maybe again for me, not sure.
Humboldt Brown Hemp Ale;Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Humboldt Brewing Company (Total Beverage Solution);Nice carmelized malty brown ale with a bit of cocoa finish. Full flavored and balanced. Slight bitterness to the finish but overall malty and a bit sweet. Descent.

Not much bitterness to back things up and has a worty/underattenuated flavor. Bleeeck! 2/11
Humboldt Brown Hemp Ale;Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Humboldt Brewing Company (Total Beverage Solution);Bottle pour into nonic pint glass from Greg & Jane’s Beer and Wine.

Taste is sweet dark fruits/cherry and caramel with late mild herbs. Palate is medium bodied with thick texture, average carbonation and sweet finish.

Humboldt Brown Hemp Ale;Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Humboldt Brewing Company (Total Beverage Solution);Pours a medium brown color. Aromas of light chocolate, hops, and a touch of nut. Flavor has a smooth chocolate/coffee blend with a hint of nut, and a nice hop finish.
Humboldt Brown Hemp Ale;Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Humboldt Brewing Company (Total Beverage Solution);I don’t know much about hemp. It used to be my summer job to exterminate wild hemp and noxious weeds from my late grandmother’s farm. (Her name was Mary Jayne - you can’t make that up). Hemp’s a hearty plant and a damned nuisance to remove. It smells sweet like oregano when fresh. It’s absolutely foul when burned. (Sadly, given the dismally low THC content burning it was not a pleasant removal method at all.) Humboldt Brown had a bit of that sweet, herbal character I remembered, but other than a faint aroma the hemp doesn’t really add much. In the end, this brown ale ends up being, well, a brown ale. Nothing remarkable but totally okay.
Humboldt Brown Hemp Ale;Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Humboldt Brewing Company (Total Beverage Solution);Not great, not bad. Would be great to drink a whole six pack around a fire. Probably would not get again.
Humboldt Brown Hemp Ale;Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Humboldt Brewing Company (Total Beverage Solution);Can’t really smell but hint of something good in there...just so mild...dark reddish appearance...

James Page Boundary Waters Golden Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stevens Point Brewery;"I had no idea that they had changed the name. I used to drink this as ""james page wild rice lager"" I thought they had stopped brewin it. THAT WAS 13Y AGO! I am running out tomorrow and buying some! When I first became a beer snob i drank my weight in this stuff weekly. All i remember was being able to taste the wild rice, and a real smooth, slightly bitter finish. Great, now i am getting all misty."
James Page Boundary Waters Golden Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stevens Point Brewery;Had this one bottled. Light orange pour with a filmy white head, nose of sweet bread, notes of baked bread, hops and orange. Not bad.
James Page Boundary Waters Golden Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stevens Point Brewery;Pours a golden orange color with light white head. Aroma of bready grains and light caramel malts. You can definitely taste the wild rice. Interesting brew. Different enough to purchase again... and probably again.
James Page Boundary Waters Golden Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stevens Point Brewery;Bottle courtesy of CharlesDarwin. An orange pour with a thin and fizzy light-tan head. A very unique aroma of freshly baked bread, vanilla extract and malts. The wild rice smell really shows up as it warms. Smooth, sweet stuff. Quite doughy. A little herbal with hints of anise. Unique stuff all the way.

James Page Boundary Waters Golden Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stevens Point Brewery;Bottle, Cold Springs Brewery. Dark golden color with a smaller diminishing yellowish (similar to a ages piece of paper) colored head. Toasted white bread aromas along with some light caramel and a hint of light floral hops. Really has a wild rice quality. Lightly sweet wild rice flavors mix with mild rose and lavender. A sweeter lager. A mild bitter linger helps ensure that his does get to sweet. A novel brew. Let see if Point does anything with this one. Thanks CharlesDarwin.
James Page Boundary Waters Golden Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stevens Point Brewery;Nice amber hued gold, with a nice line of white crisp head. Effervescent. Sweet plain malt aroma, with a touch of grass. Flavor is pretty boring at first, of plain malt with the usual touch of hops. Ends with some caramel, more grass and a little saltiness. Not offensive, not amazing. Very drinkable and smooth. Palate is smooth and lightly sugary.
James Page Boundary Waters Golden Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stevens Point Brewery;Its hard to believe anyone would brew something this bad on purpose. I’m thinking I got a bad bottle. Terrible paint thinner and licorice aroma. Pours a nice copper brown. Terrible rubber aftertaste. I’m rating as-is with an open mind to try another sample.
James Page Boundary Waters Golden Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stevens Point Brewery;Hmmm... I wasn’t aware that Pilseners could be brewed using Ojibwe manoomin (wild rice). A decent enough drink, deep gold, slight head, musty earthy hop odor over sweet grasses. The flavor had a surprisingly fruity, apple & peach, kind of a twist. An earthy hop bitterness returns on the finish Sal’s Beverage World, Elmhurst, IL
James Page Boundary Waters Golden Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stevens Point Brewery;This smelled just like a field of grass. I was excited to try this because the other James Pages brews I have had are great. This one didn’t live up to the hype I gave it. Orangish color with a quickly diminishing bubbly head. This didn’t really have that smooth of a taste.

Flavours of sweet hops, herbs, some malts, hints of wilder yeast, light caramel, some lacto tones, cream... Must be a mild infection, but I think it only helps the beer a bit. Nice.

Not that I really want to drink it in any volume, but there’s not the big cloying flaws that you usually find with a lot of brewpub raspberry wheats. Finishes with more lingering “raspberry” flavor. Not for me, but better than most, which is something I guess.

Bittings Best Bitter;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;I had it on tap. It pours a hazy copper with some off-white head and little lacing. The aroma was fruit and floral hops. The taste was more fruity than expected with only slight hop bitterness. It was smooth. This was an okay beer.

Bittings Best Bitter;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a good looking orange body with a fluffy mostly white head. Aroma was lousy and weak, barely detectable aroma of grains and vomit, yuck. Flavor was dry with notes of lots of ceral and grains along with a touch of chocolate. Body was medium with strong carbonation. Meh, it was okay but nothing special.
Bittings Best Bitter;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Cask Conditioned - Poured muddy copper with a fairly large small bubbled white head. The head quickly dissappears to a small white lacing. The aroma was warm and a bit orangy. The flavor was much of the same - not as bitter as I would have liked and not as good as the ESB’s that I love.
Bittings Best Bitter;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;I thought that this was Bitting’s best offering at the Split Rock beerfest. And it was that great. But is was decent and easy to drink.
Bittings Best Bitter;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Golden amber, with a small white head and almost no lacing. It looks nothing like a true English bitter, and the aroma and flavor was more along the lines of a pale...and a weak one, at that. Not hoppy, not malty, not horrible, but not impressed.
Bittings Best Bitter;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;This was an okay beer. I had this at the Split Rock Beer Festival 2007. Not something to remarkable, but okay.

Pours a slihgtly cloudy deep muddy copper with a thin lasting head and very fine cobweb lacing.

Bittings Knock Out Bock;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;This was a good, but light flavored beer. It poured with a small white head out of the tap. It was slightly floral with a bit earthy flavor but I think it was lacking flavor. Average beer.

Bittings Knock Out Bock;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;At the BP, the description contradicted the web, @ 6.4% ABV, and cold aged for 2 months, but I digress. Nice clear carmel color. Clean malty aroma with no off notes. Big malty flavor, that is exceptionally German like and outstanding. One of the best BP bock beers that I have ever had. Way to go August!
Bittings Great Scot!! Ale;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Scottish Ale;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;I had it on tap. Am I wrong, or has this one not been on tap for a while? It pours a hazy brown with a small, beige head. The aroma is caramel and smoky. The taste is caramel, nut, smoke, and grain. I like the subtle smokiness here. I'm usually not that big into the Scottish style. The smoke added a different feel to this one. It was pretty good.
Bittings Great Scot!! Ale;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Scottish Ale;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;This scot’s ale had a very mild aroma but its appearance was a dark amber with a very small white head. The taste was strong caramel with a bit of toasted nut. The palate was good but the taste was a little sweet for me. I was surprised to see the low alcohol percentage.
Bittings Great Scot!! Ale;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Scottish Ale;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Great Scot! The beer’s gone a bit sour. I don’t think there’s supposed to be a citrus flavor here. Otherwise, mild and schwarzbier-ish. Scottish Ale meets Flemish Ale.

Thin but creamy head of fine bubbles. Light carbonation. Light malt aroma with a hint of roastyness. Also some chocolate malt and a bit of peat. Kind of weak aroma. Color is very nice dark mahagony red. Flavor is typical for a scottish ale. Roasted malts, peat and a touch of smoke. Pretty dry mouthfeel. Not as sweet as most scottish ales. Soft in the mouth. Lingering roasty, smoky aftertaste. Pretty good though.
Bittings Great Scot!! Ale;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Scottish Ale;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;ON TAP: Toasted malt nose, dark brown color. Warm round malt base with a tinge of toffee and butty. This is not very good, thin and weak.
Bittings Great Scot!! Ale;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Scottish Ale;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Light black color. Small layer of a head. Clay taste, also malt, medium long lasting. Not much going on int he nose - kind of weird for a Scottish Ale.
Bittings Great Scot!! Ale;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Scottish Ale;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Wow, an 80 Shilling! I don't know if I will ever know the difference between an 80 and a 90 Shilling beer. Inflation? Pours a dark brown color with a medium thin light beige head. Strong malt and caramel aroma. Medium-bodied and a little smokey, with a nice malt presence. There is also a tiny bit of hops lingering around. The finish didn't seem to keep up very well but overall I liked this one.

Pours lehigh brown from tap with a thin brown head. Nice roasted and dark chocolate notes on the nose. Joining those notes on the tongue is a touch of coffee. The only drawback is the mouthfeel is a bit thin but it finishes clean.

Bittings Black Jack Oatmeal Stout;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Draft sampler. Pours an off brown body with no head. Aroma is weak coffee through a filter. Body is thin and undercarbonated. Flavor is weak coffee, earth, slight syrup and overly sweet for the style. Not good.
Bittings Black Jack Oatmeal Stout;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;"A good beer but not perfect.. The ""espresso-like bitterness"" is a good description for this beer. It leaves a taste of burntness in your mouth as well. Nice dark, black appearance and dark tan head. Nice palate. The taste is almost too much for a whole pint. Very burnt, espresso, bitterness to it."

Pours a deep dark brown almsot black with a lasting beige head. Aroma is nutty, doughy yeast, caramel, chocolate and light roast.

Bittings Black Jack Oatmeal Stout;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;I was unimpressed with this oatmeal stout. It lacked any real palate and had nothing going else goin on either. Very dissappointing.
Bittings Black Jack Oatmeal Stout;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Major coffee-espresso flavors going on here, plus a lot of nuttiness that’s either enjoyable or disgusting, depending on your tastes. Black like tar.

Millstream Lager;Amana, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Millstream Brewing Company;Light amber color with a moderate yellowish head. Some lace. Light pale malt and mild floral hops. A touch sharp and earthy in the finish. I do believe these brews maybe improving.
Millstream Lager;Amana, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Millstream Brewing Company;Not too original yellowish haze, decent body, nice for an american lager. better then most actually. I would recommend it.
Millstream Lager;Amana, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Millstream Brewing Company;Perhaps it is because lagers are so difficult to identify. This beer I found equally difficult to rate. My sense is that it was a disappointing beer by both flavor and aroma. The trouble is that neither are easy to determine why. Instead of making the effort, maybe I will just go get another brand of beer.
Millstream Lager;Amana, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Millstream Brewing Company;Horrible brew. tart, tangy and undrinkable. This could be a bad batch but the beer was aweful!
Millstream Lager;Amana, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Millstream Brewing Company;Enjoyable brew. Creamy head. Complex in flavor. Hoppy and malty, Well balanced. A good brew.
Millstream Lager;Amana, Iowa, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Millstream Brewing Company;A deep copper color, clear, the head is average, beige, the lace is also adequate. Nose is malt, the front sweet, the top is light, the finish is lightly carbonated, dry, and a fair hop presence, a bit thin in the end won't score many points with me. Ranks #864 on my current 1000 beer master list.

No, there arent ""lemons and citrus"" as some say. BS. It tastes like beer and a good one it is. Will buy again. Thanks for this site that does more than accept opinions that the site agrees with and not much else. Sites that claim to be your ""advocate"" do little other than support HOPS OVERLOADED beers. Is that really beer???? I think not."
Gaffel Kölsch;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Privatbrauerei Gaffel Becker & Co.;2nd ranked kolsch i believe, best ice cold from the bottle, but its a matter of taste, it has a stronger hopfy flavour than other kölsch but overall balanced and classical
Gaffel Kölsch;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Privatbrauerei Gaffel Becker & Co.;What's with all the low ratings? This beer is a real crowd pleaser on a hot day. I can't tell you how many comments I've gotten from people that it is one of the best lagers they have ever had, ever. And these are mostly from beer drinkers in Seattle who love IPAs, but on a hot summer day a Gaffel Kolsch is just the thing. It sells out at our local boutique store throughout the summer and even sometimes the big chains. Seriously shocked at the 1, 2, 3 star reviews. This is good beer! Maybe y'all just don't like lagers.

Very little aroma with just a hint of malt. A nice toasted malt and biscuit taste throughout. Good medium body and carbonation. A nice amber but nothing amazing.
Millstream Schild Brau Amber;Amana, Iowa, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Millstream Brewing Company;An okay amber. Near to no aroma. The flavor is a bit off. The malts taste like they were roasted just a bit too long, and the hops add a level of surprising astringency.
Millstream Schild Brau Amber;Amana, Iowa, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Millstream Brewing Company;Not my preferred style of beer, but everything about it seemed to mesh together. I liked it, but I’m certainly not going to the store to purchase it.

Big Rock Chop House Weizenheimer Hefe Weizen;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;Tap: slightly hazy dirty orange color. Little head.

Big Rock Chop House Weizenheimer Hefe Weizen;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;Tap. Golden colored with a slight haze. Plenty of spice, clove and bananna. Lighter bodied, definate wheaty flavor. Clove and bananna carry over into the flavor pleasantly. There is a strange taste in the finish that I picked up in another of their beers. Not entirely unpleasant but shouldn’t be there. Overall a fairly decent Hefeweizen.
Big Rock Chop House Weizenheimer Hefe Weizen;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;This is one of the two best that they have. Strong banana esters dominate. This is what I expect to have in a good Hefe Weizen. It may be that I wanted something to be relatively good. Matched well with the seafood platter I had.
Big Rock Chop House Weizenheimer Hefe Weizen;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;Pale straw color, hazy, but not as hazy as it should be. Way too candied taste. Disrupted the body and dominated the beer, throughout the main part of the body. The initial taste was sweet and still retained some wheat flavor. The beer finished watery/sweet which was not appealing. Perhaps I am being too harsh, but I like my hefe weizens and this seemed too artificial. Would have appreciated crispness, as the description claims, but did not find it.
Big Rock Chop House Norms Raggedy Ass Ale;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;IPA;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;Draft at RBSG grand tasting (notes). Pours a dark amber color with a medium sized off white head. The aroma and flavor have citrus fruit, oranges, melon, caramel and bready malts. The flavor side had more toasted malt and general bitterness with the citrus dominating hop wise. This one was kind of lost in the sea of great beers floating around.

Big Rock Chop House Norms Raggedy Ass Ale;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;IPA;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;Draft… RBSG/MBGSF… Clear amber ale with a mid-sized, creamy, white head. Excellent retention. The aroma is a mélange of tropical, citrus and fuzzy fruits. Medium to full-bodied with a silky mouthfeel and tingly carbonation. The flavor leans on the bitter side of balance, but has a very nice malt base. Much like the nose, there is an abundance of tropical and fuzzy fruit bitterness. Finishes moderately bitter and tongue-numbing. This beer seems to be a replica of the double IPA (or vice-versa), but with a little less body.

Im Geruch leicht fruchtwürzig. Im Geschmack fruchtig süß mit leichtem Zitrus. Im mittleren Abgang fruchtig und leichter Citrusgeschmack
Hoepfner Pilsner;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Hoepfner Karlsruhe (Brau Holding Intl - Heineken);Tap at the brewery. My 5th MJ500 beer on this trip. Brilliant gold, effervescent. Rocky head. Bright nose of crisp malt and spicy hops. Lemony hop flavor, somewhat stiff malt, peppery finish. A bit of cardboard. Somewhat watery but decent enough flavor. Not sure how this compares to the ones MJ tried here. They have been bought by a large company since then, as have many in Germany. This is an ok pilsner today, not not much more. Would not rate that high in the present world.

Hoepfner Pilsner;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Hoepfner Karlsruhe (Brau Holding Intl - Heineken);Typisch Duits plilsnerbier met een citroengeel/gouden gloed en een volle witte kraag. Smaak en aroma: erg verfrissend door de hopdroogheid, verder zoet moutig met wat kruiden accenten.
Hoepfner Pilsner;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Hoepfner Karlsruhe (Brau Holding Intl - Heineken);As an American I lived near Karlsruhe for over seven years and have drank dozens of different German pilsners. Hoepfner pilsner is one of the best pilsners in Germany and viewed as such by the Germans in the area. I have to agree with them. I haven't tasted a better Pilsner anywhere.
Hoepfner Porter;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Porter;Privatbrauerei Hoepfner Karlsruhe (Brau Holding Intl - Heineken);"""Porter"" aus der Privatbrauerei Hoepfner, Flasche von Bierselect.de. - Dunkles Schwarzbraun, klar. - In der Nase elegante aber etwas blasse Röstaromen, Mokka und Kakao, ganz leichte weinige Schwere. - Antrunk kräftig röstmalzig mit Mokka, Kakaopulver und ein klein wenig Asche. Leichte, mild karamellige Restsüße. Dezente aber aromatische kräuterige Hopfenherbe (Schweizer Kräuterzucker - ist das Tettnanger?). Vollmundig, leicht trocken; der etwas höhere Alkoholgehalt ist perfekt eingebunden. Im Abgang mild hopfenwürzige Herbe. Langer malzbitterer Nachtrunk. - Interessantes Bier, vom Geschmacksprofil her eindeutig untergärig und somit kein klassisches Porter sondern eher ein schwarzes Märzen. Jedenfalls sehr probierenswert."
Hoepfner Porter;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Porter;Privatbrauerei Hoepfner Karlsruhe (Brau Holding Intl - Heineken);"This is a traditional German black lager that is named ""porter"", as were all the Baltic Porters in this part of the world then. The reason why they call have placed it under ""porter"" beats me. Finally had a chance to try this, and it's shite. Aroma of grape-flavoured Fanta and Karamalz. Flavour is also Karamalz, bit a touch bitter, disappearing before you even start to notice it. So uni-dimensional and brief is the experience, with this watery beer. The best thinks I can say about it is (1), the presentation is looking good, and (2) it is better than the Lausitzer Porter."
Big Rock Chop House Flying Buffalo Stout;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;Very dark color. Nice complex yet smooth yeasty/malty aroma. The thing that struck me most about this beer was its even taste. Must be the rolled oats. Had a chewy texture and some faint herbal notes that were intersparsed with malt. Fairly sweet as it warmed up, and left the palette not too sweet, but with not much other flavor.
Big Rock Chop House Flying Buffalo Stout;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;This is a fancier place with incredible service and great, if pricey food. I was treated to a visit here for my wedding anniversary and mostly remember the cuisine and the nervous valet who parked our car. This is the one memorable brew, though - sweeter and thinner than I like my stouts, but enough roast to keep me interested, despite the amazing menu.

Hoepfner Cola-Radler;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Privatbrauerei Hoepfner Karlsruhe (Brau Holding Intl - Heineken);Bottled (backlog).

Hartmann Felsenweisse;Scheßlitz-Würgau, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Hartmann;Draft at Brauerei Hartmann in Nov. 2013: Clean and expressively phenolic aromas of pineapple, flower nectar, gum, honeydew melon, clove, and a hint of cookie and citrus. Fluffy carbonation. Slippery and thin body. Opens with a pronounced weighty peach tang and slick banana notes. Malt doesn’t pack a whole lot of vividness as it takes a backseat to the estery onslaught. Ensuing phenolic intensity dries things out and temporarily displaces the pervasive fruitiness. Plenty of gum to accompany the clingy and starchy wheat base, though a gummy candy suggestion and saccharine-like sweetness mar the cleanness somewhat. Finishes with gentle flower petal accents amid a subtle nectar push. Soft maltiness precedes a lasting orange gummy candy slickness which lingers. Bit of a mixed bag for me. The nose is pleasant enough and features all that I look for in a well made weissbier, but it certainly doesn’t portend the odd slickness and fruity ester overload of the flavor profile. Decent.

Browned bananas with strong phenols in the nose. Thin body for weizen with a rich dark cookie batter and dark wheat bread flavor, texture has a strong savoriness which defies its lean disposition.

Motor City Nut Brown Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Motor City Brewing Works;Reviewed from notes. Thanks Mike. Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a soft burnt amber almost brown color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that fell off at a decent pace. Mild stringy lace. The aroma had some sweet to roasty nuts with a gentle clean maltiness of some caramel to toffee tones. Light earthiness, some grassiness. Little bit of some piney-ness. The flavor kept the roasty nuts up front and blended the sweet and earthy portions to the ebb and flow of the tastes rolling along my tongue. Not much of an aftertaste. Nice piney/earthy and nutty clean smooth sweet finish. The feel was about medium bodied with a good sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine and the ABV felt as projected by the brewer. Overall, really nice brown ale well worthy of wanting again.
Motor City Nut Brown Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Motor City Brewing Works;Bottle... Pours beautifully clear and brown with flashes of mahogany. The aroma features roasted tree nuts with an undertone of cocoa. Light-bodied and thin with adequate carbonation. The flavor is toasty and chocolaty, but also watery and thin. Lengthy, crisp, lightly bitter finish. Bottle courtesy of my father-in-law, Max, from Michigan!
Motor City Nut Brown Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Motor City Brewing Works;On tap, poured into a snifger. The aroma is grape jelly and toast that mellows towards a praline aroma. The beer is dark and oily looking with a cola color, and is topped by a light tan head that’s dense, but thin and soap with a filmy surface that has a light retention and specks of lace. The beer is a medium sweet and light bitter. It’s water thin and smooth with a fizzy carbonation and a light body. Flavors of dry molasses and nuts and dominant on the palate with a finish that’s spicy with toast and alight coffee flavor. The dry aftertaste is clean with notes of spice and toast.
Motor City Nut Brown Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Motor City Brewing Works;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/19/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, light fruitiness, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, light fruitiness, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, light fruitiness, and yeast/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity, balance, and solid robustness of dark/roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/yeast ester flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a very good English brown ale style. All around good complexity, balance, and solid robustness of dark/roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

Assertive citrus malt aroma. Bittersweet malt flavor. Intense fruity, winey flavor. Little hop flavor to speak of. Big alcohol note.
St. Ides Premium Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Originally rated on 11/1/07. I used to drink this in the army because of the price. A case of this was comparable to bud so.. If you are looking for a cheap buzz this will do the trick. Like most malt liquors it wont impress any beer snobs, smells and tastes a little funky but its not as bad as some.
St. Ides Premium Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;40 oz to pint (from notes). Exactly the nasty horse piss you’d expect it to be. Simply unpleasant in every way (although not as bad as Camo or some others out there).
St. Ides Premium Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Use to drink this religiously when I was younger, it was a hit and miss perhaps some stores didn’t have good cooling system. This beer is not good it will get u somewhere, but one will wake up smelling like pure bar or sometimes even worst. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
St. Ides Premium Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Big-ass can. Man, I think next time I’ll save myself the trouble and just cut my tongue out from my mouth with a rusty razorblade. Copper corn, rotten yeast, and stupid are all one gets from this crap.
St. Ides Premium Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;I thought this was going to be pretty decent since famous people drink it (i.e. snoop dogg and dr dre), I was wrong, it is terrible, tastes like beer that was fermented in an old gym shoe.
St. Ides Premium Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;My first 40 at age 12 back in 1991. This had only been around for a couple years back then but we knew all about it from Ice Cube and NWA. Very strong back then it was 7.3% when it was Ides Premium. Now its Ides High Gravity and it comes in at 8.2%. Still tastes the same but the original has the edge just because of its historic value to me. I am glad I was able to pick up an empty Ides Premium 40 for my collection a couple years ago. Also the St. Ides buzz is very violent. Its unlike any other buzz I have ever gotten from a 40. Be very carful as drinking 2 or more 40s of Ides will produce the worst hangover ever.
St. Ides Premium Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;the fact is for $1.89 in 1994-1998 , this was the best thing u could buy, wasn’t really that much worse than bud, best of the 40’s in my opinion. But the most important thing about this beer is that even a dorky indian doofus can feel like Ice Cube(the gangster one, not the barber shop one)!
St. Ides Premium Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;As far as cheap malt liquors for college kids to get drunk off of I suppose it’s not completely horrible. Better than Colt 45, King Cobra or Old English for what it’s worth. Still, c’mon, this is nasty stuff.
St. Ides Premium Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;So after I tried the St Ides special brew, I took a leak and out came the st ide premium. Geez this sucks.

Park Export;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Parkbrauerei;Das beste Bier der Welt. Das ist die Referenz. Quasi das Urmeter des Bieres. Ihr könnt das auf dem hinteren Etikett nachlesen. Park Export hilft sogar gegen Heimweh. Stimmt! Wenn ihr wirklich Ehrliche Biertriker, keine Pilsköpfe seid kommt ihr daran nicht vorbei. Wer geht zu McDonald's? Klar niemand, aber die machen riesige Umsätze. Genauso ist das mit dem Export Bier, als Maurer- oder Pennerbier verschrien, so ein Quatsch. Export ist besser als sein Ruf. Auf den Oktoberfest trinkt auch keiner Pils.

Park Weizen Hefe;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Parkbrauerei;Die Parkbrauerei braut zwei verschiedene helle Weißbiere. Neben diesem noch das Valentins Weißbier. Die Farbe ist orange-trüb mit fruchtig-bananigem Geruch. Im Antrunk ist das Bier vollmundig und schön süffig, jedoch kommt schon nach kurzer Zeit eine muffige Herbe, ganz ähnlich wie bei den Valentis Weißbieren, ins Spiel. Im Hauptteil ist das Bier aber für meinen Geschmack runder und mild-süßlicher. Die muffige Herbe ist bei wietem nicht so stark ausgeprägt. Der Nachgeschmack ist leicht, schon fast etwas wässrig und ganz leicht muffig-herb, wobei dieses durch die mild-hefige Süße schon wieder kompensiert wird. Auf der Zungebleibt eine mild-hefig-süße Note, die aber schnell wieder verfliegt. --> Leckeres, aber etwas aromenarmes Weißbier! (Test vom 22.2.2009) --> 12,10,12,9,12,10 - 10,45

Park Weizen Radler;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Parkbrauerei;Schöne hell-trübe Farbe mit sehr zitronig-limonadigem Geruch. Der Antrunk ist sehr limonadig-süß mit angenehmem Weißbier-Geschmack. Die für Park-Weißbiere typische muffige Herbe wird durch die süße Limonade gut überdeckt. Der Hauptteil ist erst sehr angenehm limonadig-süß in Kombination mit einer schönen Weißbiennote, fälltdann aber sehr schnell dank des Süßstoffs in die chemisch-fade Ecke ab! Der Nachgeschmack ist zwar noch schön mild-hefig und frisch-zitronig, aber die chemische Süßstoffnote ist durch den faden Geschmack allgegenwärtig. --> Wäre kein Süßstoff drin, wäre es richtig klasse!!

Park Radler;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Parkbrauerei;0,33l bottle, BB 19.07.14, N3 Very pale in the glass, artificial fruity in the nose. The beers starts very lemonade-sweet. The mainpart seems full-bodied, but more lemonade than beer. The aftertaste ends abrupt. The artificial sweetener does its work - and as there is nearly no beer as basis, the aroma is gone within seconds. An artificial lemon-taste with some hops and grain remain on the tongue. --> there are many way better Radler! --> 7/10/7/7
Park Radler;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Parkbrauerei;Decent radler, not much aroma to speak of, appearance is about normal for a radler, flavor is good, but uses a limon soda, rather than real lemonade. This is how it is usually mixed at the bar, so this is about as expected.

Oaken Barrel Meridian Street Lager;Greenwood, Indiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oaken Barrel Brewing Company;Not a whole lot going on here. A craft version of the classic macro. No cord, and with hops you can actualy taste. Touch of grapes and honey. That’s about it. Not really brewed for the beer geek crowd, so take that into consideration with this review. OB makes some damn tasty beers, this just isn’t really their moment in the sun, but probably accomplishes exactly what they want it to.
Oaken Barrel Meridian Street Lager;Greenwood, Indiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oaken Barrel Brewing Company;"On tap under a different name. Pours a clear golden color with big fluffy head that laced. Classic lager aroma of malt and a bit of hops in the back. Nice dry bitter flavor balanced by a slight sweetness that did not last into the aftertaste. Lively carb, med to full body, wet refreshing texture and feel. Classic lager, simple and refeshing which is what I look for in this style. The beer you want to drink when just want a ""beer""."
Oaken Barrel Meridian Street Lager;Greenwood, Indiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oaken Barrel Brewing Company;his is a pretty nice lager. It smells kind of sour, like draft beer lines that haven’t been cleaned well but it tastes just fine. It’s fairly crisp and light.
Oaken Barrel Meridian Street Lager;Greenwood, Indiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oaken Barrel Brewing Company;Too sweet and too thin. I found it suspiciously cloudy.

Oaken Barrel Meridian Street Lager;Greenwood, Indiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oaken Barrel Brewing Company;This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized mostly lasting white bubbles that left very little lacing and a hazy straw yellow body behind. Its aroma is one of malt and banana or fruit. The mouthfeel is initially smooth then bitters in its finish. The flavor is a mixture of fruit and malt with a beady or doughy nature to it.
Oaken Barrel Meridian Street Lager;Greenwood, Indiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oaken Barrel Brewing Company;Had it on tap at the brewpub. Defective, strong diacetyl and slight DMS. A poorly made lager that I couldn't finish. The porter black bean soup, OTOH, absolutely rocked.

Oaken Barrel Leroy Brown;Greenwood, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Oaken Barrel Brewing Company;Proper medium brown color, translucent. The head was well-retained, which is not always the case at this brewpub. The aroma is rather similar to light toast. The taste is a bit light as is the mouthfeel.
Oaken Barrel Pale Ale;Greenwood, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oaken Barrel Brewing Company;Light golden pour. Good citrus hops on the aroma follwed by some nice malt. Flavor is a nice combo of caramel malt and very good hops. This is pretty damn nice for an APA.

Rolinck Pilsener Premium;Steinfurt, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei A. Rolinck (Krombacher);Has a bright, golden color with a froth, white head. Smells of a gentle interplay between grains, hay and herbal hops. This foundation gets joined by a sweet caramel peak, producing a nose, which still relies heavily on the hops. Has a light, refreshing body, to to a well working balance with a lively, metallic carbonation. Tastes way maltier and heavier on the grains than the nose indicated. Establishes a rustic malt foundation with a soothing aqueous quality, which evolves a late, herbal hop hint. Finishes clean and light, reminding of its opening with an additional mineralic note. Smells nicer than it tastes, since it tastes more like an industrial brewed beer, while it advertises to be a local heron. I don’t appreciate this very much, since, regarding the rather boring taste of this, that is solely a marketing strategy. Malts and water, not much else going on apart from that.

Rolinck (Krombacher);Flasche (50 cl) von Hopfen & Malz, Berlin-Wedding. - Hellgelb, klar, reichlich lockerer Schaum. - Geruch dumpf und etwas streng, erinnert an benutzte Babywindeln. - Antrunk schlank mit kräftig zitroniger, aber etwas künstlicher Note, die eher an Geschirrspülmittel oder Zitronenbonbons als an Aromahopfen denken läßt. Malz ist nicht zu schmecken. Gut rezent, schlank. Im Abgang wechseln sich schroff zitronige und stumpf bittere Fehlaromen ab. Derber, metallisch herber Nachtrunk. - Ziemlich mieses Pilsener, bei dem allenthalben der billige Hopfenextrakt herausschmeckt, aber wohl auch sonst noch hier und da gespart wurde. Ein Fall für den Ausguß.

Alex Rolinck Feines Lagerbier;Steinfurt, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Privatbrauerei A. Rolinck (Krombacher);Northern German ’Münchener’ helles from the town of Steinfurt (in a region where nearly every town has its own lager brewery). Dense, mousse-like, creamy, fairly thick, snow white head, colour a pure and cristal clear golden blonde with fine sparkling. Malty aroma with honeyish and a bit cheesy accent, some popcorn, floral hops reminiscent of sage and chamomille. Neutral onset with a sharp carbonation, then turning into a nearly sweetish graininess, mineral water, finishing only lightly and briefly hoppy without ever turning really bitter - one of the main features distinguishing a helles from a Pilsener in modern-day German lagers, I guess. But decent, refreshing and thirst-quenching it certainly is.

Rolinck (Krombacher);"#695 ""Traditionell gebrautes, mildwürziges Bier"" steht auf der Rückseite und das ist es auch. Es plätschert ziemlich uninspiriert die Kehle herunter. Der Geschmack ist wie die Farbe dieses Bieres: Ein Zwitter. Die Farbe ist zu dunkel für ein Export und zu hell für ein Alt. Dunkles Bernstein trifft es einigermaßen. Geschmacklich kein Export, da es etwas nach Röstmalz schmeckt; aber auch kein Alt, weil der Abgang einfach ohne diesen typisch bitteren Nachzieher auskommen muß. Kurzum: Ein Bier, dass es so in Westfalen kein zweites mal gibt...und auch keiner vermissen wird!

Oaken Barrel King Rudi;Greenwood, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Oaken Barrel Brewing Company;Cloudy appearance and pale gold with a white head that is smooth and creamy. The head holds moderately leaving a low level of lace. The beer looks thick. Banana and clove in the aroma. Both are distinctive and arrive on in a different place as opposed to combining. The banana is stronger and one has to work a bit to get the clove, but it is not insignificant. The flavors are more balanced than the aroma. Clove and banana compete for attention with lemon playing a supporting role. Alcohol is present and adds to complexity and balance. There are even light hops accenting the lemon. This has good carbonation and is thick in body. An excellent example of the style and a true German from America.
Oaken Barrel King Rudi;Greenwood, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Oaken Barrel Brewing Company;Draft: Pours completely cloudy, murky yellow..almost no head. Aroma is banana, wheat, cloves, pepper. Same flavour,...tart and sweet, almost a little sticky. Very nice.

Oaken Barrel Plum Stout;Greenwood, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Oaken Barrel Brewing Company;At the King’s, Leicester. Lovely deep red with very dense creamy head. Very strong aroma of plum and hints of roasted malt. Plumb flavour tastes a little disconnected from the rest of the ale. Very smooth to drink and finishes sweet. Overall worth a try, but not worth buying a full pint.

Grand Teton Moose Juice Stout;Victor, Idaho, United States;Stout;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;12 oz. bottle from 2002. Pours pitch black with a brown head. Strong burnt malt, musty bready smell. Medium bodied, it has an airy, fluffy mouthfeel. Very strong flavor of roasted malts and black coffee. Has an acidic strong black coffee bitterness to finish. An unusual American stout in that it’s not sweet at all. Quite nice.Feb 2004
Grand Teton Moose Juice Stout;Victor, Idaho, United States;Stout;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Bottled. Very dark brown coloured. Chocolate aroma. Roasty flavour with notes of dark chocolate. Dry finish with hoppy notes. Soft mouthfeel.
Grand Teton Moose Juice Stout;Victor, Idaho, United States;Stout;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Coffee, roasty, thin consistency. Very good color. A chocolate-y aftertaste.
Grand Teton Moose Juice Stout;Victor, Idaho, United States;Stout;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;"Dark oily color with a nice tan film of head & lacing. The aroma is roasted with tar and mocha, lightly apparent hops; from the aging perhaps. Also some licorice, vanilla and fruity dust. The flavor has a good balance between astringent roast, residual sugars and hop bitterness. Finishes mild, robust and chocolatey. Good stout, too bad it’s not in production any more. Fucking Moosehead Brewing! Thanks a ton mitch!"
Grand Teton Moose Juice Stout;Victor, Idaho, United States;Stout;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Brown with little head and oily lacing. Roast aromas with some bitter hops and coffee. Some chocolate and a touch of tobacco. The flavors are pretty much in line with the aromas. The chocolate comes out quite a bit more. Bitterness is milder. The roast is happy. Smooth and silky palate. Smooth finish of malts.
Grand Teton Moose Juice Stout;Victor, Idaho, United States;Stout;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Mild stout. A little bitter, but not too much. Nutty flavour. Quite roasted.
Grand Teton Moose Juice Stout;Victor, Idaho, United States;Stout;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;The aroma is fantastic with notes of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. The color is black and it has a chocolate brown head though disappearing. The flavor is of roasted malt and dark bitter chocolate, in the end it turns to coffee and get a little acidic. A really good beer.
Grand Teton Moose Juice Stout;Victor, Idaho, United States;Stout;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;I thought this was a little bit thin for a Stout. Not bad, but it won't rate at the top without a little more body and aroma. Drinkable and pleasant beer.
Grand Teton Moose Juice Stout;Victor, Idaho, United States;Stout;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;"Moose Juice Stout, what a name! This stout pours like most; dark brown, settles solid black in the glass. A strong pour produced a finger high dark cocoa brown, foamy, uniformly bubbled head with a bit of a rocky top that faded slowly to a thin ring and some stringy patches of lace. Looks damn good. How's it smell? Wiff in....ahhh, nice sweet chocolate, sorta dark and chocolate milkish; cocoa, a bit of burntness of cookies, some coffee, and notes of hazelnuts. How's it taste? Sip, gulp....Oh well, the smell doesn't transfer as strong as I wanted; not nearly enough. Its quite quick and thin of chocolate and cocoa, slight roastyness and a faint light nudge of coffee with some burntness character attributed to the middle and a coffee-like dryness mixed with a solid little hop bite in the finish that lingers a bit. But its over far to fast. Although...this stout likes to change character quickly as it warms, it goes through a bit of transformation from thin to more of a bolder quality and finishing a bit stronger as well. But not enough to enhance the experience any. Feel is smooth and creamy and a bit thin of a lighter medium body that gains some momentum into the finish and a dot more as it warms. This stuff goes down very easy, its very drinkable! To bad it doesn't pack a bit more flavorful punch. But, as-for-mentioned, it gets a bit more noticeable subtleness to its flavors and feel as it warms. My suggestion is to let it breath a bit before diving in. A smidgen better at a warmer temp."
Grand Teton Moose Juice Stout;Victor, Idaho, United States;Stout;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Dark, ok head, coffee and bakers chocolatey notes. Dry finish like a mouthful of cotton. Drinkable.
Grand Teton Old Faithful Ale;Victor, Idaho, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;(14/08/19) 355ml can, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Light golden with a white head. Malty, earthy aroma. Taste of malts and biscuits with floral and grassy notes. Mild bitterness. Medium mouthfeel. Pleasant but nothing special.
Grand Teton Old Faithful Ale;Victor, Idaho, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Got this from my super, he's a really cool dude. Can right from the good old yellowstone park. Slightly below room temp can. Pour is big foamy brew. I think I jiggled it a little on the way in. Slight haze on pale. Taste is quite ale like, of course, you know, all those negative attitudes about ale in general. Not too bad considering the temperature. Probably a little more like a wheat ale, if you ask me. Yes, not as behaved as Indigo Imp Blonde Bombshell, Rusty Rail Blue Collar, North Country Bucco Blonde or even Paladin Sir Kenneth. Compare it to a wheat ale like Terrapin SunRay, Tap Room No. 21 Moe's Backroom Wheat Beer, New Belgium Snapshot, Blue Moon Rising Moon Spring Ale or Beaver Chamomile Wheat and it still needs manners.
Grand Teton Old Faithful Ale;Victor, Idaho, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;(12oz, bottled 07/10/18) Pours a clear golden body with a small off-white head. Aroma of citrus zest, pine, grain, and earth. Flavor of grain, earth, lemon, grass, and caramel.
Grand Teton Old Faithful Ale;Victor, Idaho, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;"(Bottle) clear, bright yellow colour with a small white head; aroma of jam, grain; balanced flavour with a long, light bitter finish"
Grand Teton Old Faithful Ale;Victor, Idaho, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;12 oz bottle. Bottled on 1/31/18. (The Liquor Store of Jackson Hole) Jackson Hole, WY. Cloudy golden color with a small to medium size foamy white head. Green apple, dryness, mild metal and some straw in the aroma. Cheapish aroma. The flavor is not much more desirable with metal, dry malt, straw, mild green apple and some bitterness. Not that rewarding... quite opposite to Yellowstone.
Grand Teton Huckleberry Wheat;Victor, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Pours a hazy golden brownish color. Aromas of mild berries, wheat bread, and a touch of hops. Flavor is a nice balance of soft fruit flavor with malts and a crisp dry finish. I’m not big on fruit beers, but this one has a subdued flavor, not over the top.
Grand Teton Huckleberry Wheat;Victor, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Had this beer on 6/22/2000. Aroma is a fruity scent. Color is a hazy golden brown, with good carbonation and too much head. Taste malty and lightly fruity. Starting with a light body and going down easy. Finish is a light sour malt flavor with a somewhat bitter fruit end.
Grand Teton Huckleberry Wheat;Victor, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;I'm not a big fruit beer fan, but I will attempt to be unbiased. As an overall beer, I thought this was a little thin and lacking. Fruit replaces complexity in this beer to produce a refreshing beer that will make a macro swill drinker feel that he has become a connoisseur of American Micros. Put in more malt and hops and save the huckleberries for pancakes in the morning.
Grand Teton Huckleberry Wheat;Victor, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;clear golden color, quickly fading white head, didn't notice any huckleberry flavor or aroma. On the palate, it's a bit sour.
Grand Teton Huckleberry Wheat;Victor, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Sweet fruity nose, nice gold with a white head, lite lacing. Flavors of citrus, and a good balance between the malt. As far as the huckelberries, didn't really find them. There is a sweet finish to it, maybe that is them screaming to get out.
Grand Teton Huckleberry Wheat;Victor, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;So I'm settling into the Cheyenne, WY library to rate the beers I've had on this western trip, and I rate this one first in honor of brother krisbierjaeger, who designed the label and gave me many good tips for beer hunting out here. First the label, which is a couple of Grizzlies beneath the mountains - reminding me of the bear I saw in Yellowstone a few days ago. Tasteful, well done Kris! The beer is pleasant, sweetish, mellow - my wife and I tried real hard to find the huckleberries, but couldn't really taste them, other than a whisp of fruit here and there, like a mirage in the desert. The beer, though is a good citrusy quencher and a fine start to a session of Grand Teton beer.
Barrel House Cumberland Pale Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrel House Brewing Company;22oz bottle in a shaker. Pours light amber with a lacy off-white head. Aroma of light hops and fruit with a little bread. The hops are a little light in the flavor, and the malts could be increased too. A decent beer for this style, but not the best.
Barrel House Cumberland Pale Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrel House Brewing Company;Bomber from Network Liquors in Roseville $1.99 sale on bombers. Pour is copper orange with a frothy head and minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet sugar and malt. Taste is more sweet sugary malt and some nice subtle hops and spice. Palate is fizzy and sticky with a chaulky dry finish. Solid pale ale.
Barrel House Cumberland Pale Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrel House Brewing Company;i can’t believe this pale ale is rated as low as it is. pours deep orange with nice head. nose is typical, malty and citrusy. taste is rather complex, i get the hint of mango or papaya along with peach and lyche. definately more taste than your standard PA. 22oz bottle was on sale for $2. definately heading back for more.
Barrel House Cumberland Pale Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrel House Brewing Company;A huge oatmeal appearing head. The huge amount of foam seems to be a hallmark of Barrel House beers. The beer is golden with a touch of amber. Complex hop aroma is kind of muddled as is the malt and fruit. The flavor, again, seems to have the Barrel House yeast taste. It is also a bit muddled but is nicer than the aroma. Sweet citrus fruit, sugar, caramel, cinnamon spice, and toast. Hops are noticed very late and definitely don’t assert. Not a great beer and hops need to make themselves known.
Barrel House Cumberland Pale Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrel House Brewing Company;22 oz. bottle. Pours a medium orange amber color with a medium off white head. The aroma is grassy, citrus hops , and light moderately sweet malt. The flavor is more grass with the citrus hanging around as well. Dry comes to mind, as does a strange damp hoppiness that is strange with this beer. There is probably a reason it has taken me this long to rate some of the few locals we have in Cincy.
Barrel House Cumberland Pale Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrel House Brewing Company;Pours gold/orange, wuith a very large head. Aroma is hops, grass, and malt. Flavor is hops, grass, and some fruit. Light to medium body. Slightly bitter finish.
Barrel House Cumberland Pale Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrel House Brewing Company;"12/19/2007: Barrel House Cumberland Pale Ale (Cask) has a grassy aroma with some vague citrus and a hint of butterscotch. The beer is a clear copper-orange color and is nearly still. The flavor is somewhat disconnected through. It is very grassy and dry with flavors of both old hops and ""wet"" hops (Cascade?), although it isn’t that good. The mild to moderate bitterness is lasting. This beer has a medium-light body and is smooth. I’m not so sure that the cask aging and dry hop did anything positive for this beer... CASKsample at Nicholson’s Scottish Pub in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. Rating #102 for this beer..."
Barrel House Cumberland Pale Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrel House Brewing Company;Draft pint from Arnold’s in downtown Cincinnati. Light orange pour with thin white head. Strong but quick blast of hops, also sweet, peachy, citrusy, and floral. Worth a try but unspectacular.
Barrel House Cumberland Pale Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrel House Brewing Company;Bomber. Pours a copper body with a huge white head. Grainy, floral, moth y citrus aroma. Metallic notes and tin, with a grainy finish. Hops are very subtle. Nothing to write home about.
Barrel House Cumberland Pale Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barrel House Brewing Company;22 oz’er. Poured the suspected orange-copper color with a quick head. There’s a sweet grassy aroma to this. The initial impression is the same, a sweet citrusy beer -- but then a deepr metallic, woody sting, with a distinct peachy aspect to it, too. (#3541, 5/17/2009)
Barrel House Oktoberfest;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Barrel House Brewing Company;<br /><b>9/26/2007</b>: Barrel House Oktoberfest Lager is extremely disappointing. Beyond the typcical Oktoberfest beer appearance the aroma is extremely buttery (lots of Diacetyl) and the flavor is acidic like sweet vinegar. I has a full body though that is creamy and smooth. Other than that, something definitely went wrong with this beer. It isn’t good at all and probably the worst of the Barrel House bottle offerings!<br /><br /> <i>Sample(s) from 22 fl. oz. bottles (Alcohol 6.2% by Volume) shared at the September 2007 Jundale Beerklub Tasting. Thanks! Rating #29 for this beer.</i><br />
Barrel House Oktoberfest;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Barrel House Brewing Company;Bomber. Pours a pretty, dark golden/amber color with a small but well retained white head. Smell is sweet, toasty, malty, normal vienna/marzen aroma. Pleasant aroma, almost Great Lakes-esque. Taste is light, smooth, clean, slightly - very slightly sweet, pretty dry for the style. Highly drinkable. Don’t understand the low scores on this one. Granted it’s not fantastic or anything but it’s certainly a decent if not good example of the style.
Barrel House Oktoberfest;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Barrel House Brewing Company;Pours dark amber with a nice cream colored head. Aroma is bready malt with a little caramel. Starts out somewhat sweet and bready, balanced well by the tartness from the hops. I think it’s a pretty good representation of an Oktoberfest, they must have addressed the sour/infection issue from last years batch as noted in previous ratings.
Barrel House Oktoberfest;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Barrel House Brewing Company;Pours a dark amber in color. Only a slight frothy head forms on the pour. It quickly recedes to nothing. Smell is all malts. There are a good amoun of hops in the taste. Also some good toffee and spice as well. Decent mouthfeel and very easy drinking.
Barrel House Oktoberfest;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Barrel House Brewing Company;I found this one quite enjoyable and am surprised by the recent negative reviews. I enjoy this style, and this one was a bit unique because it had a bit more hops, at least in some mouthfuls. The color was deep orange, aroma of molasses and cinammon. Apples in the palate along with graham crackers. Occasional hoppiness. This had wonderful complexity for an Okt.

Clear golden color with a thin white head. Minimal lacing. Light hops and sweet honey aroma. The body is light and crisp with subtle malt and honey flavors. Touches of hops here and there too. The finish is clean and short. I can appreciate this beer a little more now, having had more exposure to the style, but it’s still pretty average. 11/13/02 (2.4)Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9.

Barrel House SternWheeler Stout;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Barrel House Brewing Company;From the Barrelhouse Brewpub on East 12th street - Yeah, this is an old review of a mefiocre sweet stout, but I used to get growlers of the stuff from the pub.
Barrel House SternWheeler Stout;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Barrel House Brewing Company;Nice one. This is my first experience and I like it. Nice aroma, it forces us to drink.
Barrel House SternWheeler Stout;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Barrel House Brewing Company;Had this one on tap at the Barrelhouse as usual.

The finish is nice without all the burnt lingerings of so many other stouts.
Barrel House SternWheeler Stout;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Barrel House Brewing Company;On tap at Barrel House. Poured with a deep cocoa body, topped by a medium tan head.

A solid, rich stout.

Barrel House SternWheeler Stout;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Barrel House Brewing Company;Excellent stout. So smooth that it seems like a hybrid sweet stout and Irish dry stout. Rick, the brewer, does a fine job with all the B.H. beers and this one is no exception. Rich, coffee and chocolate flavors are evident. Just the right amount of bitterness. Very warming, firm and enjoyable.
Barrel House RedLegg Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Barrel House Brewing Company;22oz bottle (another forgotten bottle. Poured a copper color with a larger sized head. I should have opened this when I got it v. forgot it ...
Barrel House RedLegg Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Barrel House Brewing Company;Bottle at Sander’s place, NYC. Ah, WTF! This beer is rancid, basically. Pours dark ruby with a big, off-white foam head. Tart fruits and toasty malts in the nose. Extremely sour flavor. In fact, if this was a lambic it wouldn’t be half bad. As it is, I’m concerned. Medium in body with big carbonation. Lasting pucker sour finish. Bummer, mostly.

Palate is sticky and chaulky that finishes dry. I really enjoyed this one, has some nice characteristics.
Barrel House RedLegg Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Barrel House Brewing Company;The head on this beer can almost be described as nuclear. It jumps up from the pour. Light tan in color it is long lasting and quite fizzy. A pleasant aroma is sweet malt and complex fruit. The beer itself is clear and a soft copper color. Flavor offers gentle fruit notes, light cinnamon, and some grapefruit underneath. As the beer warms some dark fruit and chocolate develop. Things get a bit muddled here and nothing really works well together. Decent, though.
Barrel House RedLegg Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Barrel House Brewing Company;"On Tap at ""The Pub at Crestview Hills"" on a trip to Northern KY - Pours a transparent copper amber with a thin, off-white head.

Barrel House RedLegg Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Barrel House Brewing Company;Bottle bonus thanks to phaleslu! Hazy apricot pour, little carbonation and a little citrus. Flavor is malt and sour apple and tasted slightly oxidied.

Barrel House RedLegg Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Barrel House Brewing Company;A nice red-copper color with a white head. Bright fruits, malty, a bit of roast, and some caramel in the aroma. Flavor is fruity and sour. Not much in the way of hops but full of caramel malts. Some lemon and cherry as well. I’m not a fan.
Barrel House RedLegg Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Barrel House Brewing Company;Overall pretty boring for a red. Not much flavor. Simple caramel malts with a touch of odd spice and rotten grain and old hops.
Barrel House Flying Pig Pilsner;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Barrel House Brewing Company;Several glasses on tap at the Cincinnati Blues Fest, Summer 2005. This is quite clean overall with a real fresh, slighly herbal and definitely sweet aroma, but not corny at all. Some bitterness -- actually I thought this was quite good. Sweetness came on a bit stronger later but nowhere near sticky.
Barrel House Flying Pig Pilsner;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Barrel House Brewing Company;Tap. Golden color with small white head. Low aroma of hops. Flavor and finish was medium of bitter hops. Drinkable bar brew.

Barrel House Flying Pig Pilsner;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Barrel House Brewing Company;Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. Golden color with a thin head but decent lacing. Mildly hoppy aroma. This wasn''t so great but it was not skunky or flavorless like many Pilseners. Unfortunately it was pretty boring either way.
Barrel House Strawberry Blond;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barrel House Brewing Company;I was a little worred about this one cause i've had some bad experiences with fruit beer in the past, but I decided to try it anyway. Poured golden and cloudy with a slight pinkish hue. aroma was of fresh strawberries and the flavor was of the same with the essence of a blond ale. The thing that i liked the most about this beer is that the fruit is not overpowering or artificaial tasting. a very refreshing beer for a hot cincinnati day.
Barrel House Duveneck Dortmunder;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Barrel House Brewing Company;briny aroma, like a can of black olives, with some citrus and caramel. old bottle? i agree it smells kinda belgian or something. taste is a bit sour, bright, some caramel and toast. medium body, lively carbonation. this is pretty weird but not bad.
Barrel House Duveneck Dortmunder;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Barrel House Brewing Company;Poured from a bomber into a footed pilsner. Appearance is a translucent yellow with an enormous white head. Several inches of foam produced from a small amount of liquid. Aroma is sweet and grainy. Reminds me a lot of duvel in the aroma. Taste is sweet, fruity, grainy, and a touch of alcohol. This beer rocks.
Barrel House Duveneck Dortmunder;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Barrel House Brewing Company;22 oz Bottle -- Pours reddish-orange with a foamy off-white head. Smells more like a belgian than a dortmunder. Aromas of biscuits, malt, fig, raisins, sweet potato, brown sugar, and yeast. Sweet throughout the palate.
Barrel House Duveneck Dortmunder;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Barrel House Brewing Company;Tap. Semi-hazy orange pour with a foamy white head. Aroma and taste of malt and biscuits. Just okay - nothing great.
Barrel House Duveneck Dortmunder;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Barrel House Brewing Company;When this beer is virtually 100% off white head. Very slowly the foam drops and liquid appears. That beer is clear golden and is well carbonated. Some solids in the final pour. Aroma is malt, fruit, biscuit, and alcohol (even tho ABV is listed as 4.5%). Flavor is malt dominated with fruit, biscuit, and rye. Flavor warmed nicely and it became a pretty good beer. It started a bit rocky, but ended well.
Barrel House Duveneck Dortmunder;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Barrel House Brewing Company;Bottle bonus thanks to phaleslu! Straw yellow poor, ongoing carbonation and an aroma of squash?? Flavor is better than the aroma, some white pepper, sugar, a little hops and finished vegetal on the aftertaste. Probably wouldn’t buy this one.
Barrel House Duveneck Dortmunder;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Barrel House Brewing Company;I’m not sure what to do with this, smells like a triple? why is that? this can’t be a dortmunder. I saw other people saying they thought their bottles were old, i think mine was mixed up. Not sure, it’s good but not what i was expecting.
Barrel House Duveneck Dortmunder;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Barrel House Brewing Company;I had this from a bottle. It could have been old. The color was very pale with a brown-yellow tint. Minimal carbonation. There were some honey flavors, but over all it was stale, however, did not taste skunked. This did not come close to a dortmunder style.
Barrel House Duveneck Dortmunder;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Barrel House Brewing Company;22 oz. bottle (notes). Pours a clear golden color with a larger off white head. The aroma is mildly sweet biscuity malt with a hint of lemon citrus and mild hop spiciness. The flavor is more biscuity malt with a touch of honey sweetness. Toward the finish the lemon citrus gets a touch sour which is strange. Slight hints of toasted bread come out. Light-medium bodied with a slightly dry finish.
Barrel House Duveneck Dortmunder;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Barrel House Brewing Company;Draft sample at a Barrel House tasting at Teller’s of Hyde Park.

Barrel House Belgian Winter Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Dubbel;Barrel House Brewing Company;Bottle from Phalesu. Thanks! Pours a deep walnut brown with a dissipating beige head. Aroma of fruity esters and dark Belgian malts. Medium bodied with somewhat soft carbonation, but a little thin in the middle. Flavor of mild chocolate, unripe berries, spice, and plums. Just a hint of acidity. Some phenols on the finish along with some yeast. Has somewhat of a homebrew quality to it.
Barrel House Belgian Winter Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Dubbel;Barrel House Brewing Company;Bottle sample at a Barrel House dinner at Teller’s of Hyde Park. Pours a dark, almost opaque ruby-brown color with a medium tan head. Aroma of berries, dried fruits, caramel, molasses, sweet grains, sweet malts, and biscuit. The flavor is sweet and tart, with notes of berries, caramel, molasses, sweet roasted malts, figs, biscuit, winter spices, and bread. Medium bodied, with a syrupy, oily, and chewy mouthfee. The tartness is not overpowering, and adds an unexpected element for the style. Some of the spices and milder flavors are overshadowed on the nose by the berries and sweeter elements, but these all come out more clearly on the palate. Alcohol becomes just a bit apparent as it warms. Really nice winter beer.
Barrel House Belgian Winter Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Dubbel;Barrel House Brewing Company;Draft. Brown color with a frothy head. Aroma has some spice and grain and some faint fruit. Flavor has plums, spice and yeast with some sweet and tart taste.

(3+) Mild aroma, light fruit and malt. (6+) Flavour is similar, tart fruit over malt, touch old? Sharp tart fruit in the finish. (6+) Average palate is lightly carbonated. Bottle at BCTC 2009, shared by DuctTape
Barrel House Belgian Winter Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Dubbel;Barrel House Brewing Company;Dark brown body with mahogany edges with some light and a light yellowish khaki head. The aroma has some perfume with sweet notes of pear and Belgian funk. There is also bubblegum and a little hint of melted plastic. The taste has some old leather and tart apples. There is also some paper and plastic hints. A heavy body, but smooth feeling. There is definitely something wrong here with the tart character. Too salty.
Barrel House Belgian Winter Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Dubbel;Barrel House Brewing Company;In the bomber bottle from Beertopia. At $3.49 a bottle, how can you go wrong for a 8.5% beer? The beer pours black with a purple highlight. The head, if agitated to do so, can produce a fine dark beige thick topping of limited durability. The initial aroma is a bit raisin-like, slightly vinous, but not large. The flavor occurs quick with roasted and raisin abbey ale features, but the beer then quickly release an unbalanced alcohol burn. <ild chalky finish that does not leave anything lingering but a slight tobacco essence. Again, good for the price, bad for the style.
Barrel House Belgian Winter Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Dubbel;Barrel House Brewing Company;i had a winter ale last night that was rated a 2.8. it was a thousand times better than this piece of shit. pours deep burgundy with some yeast opacity. 1/4 inch of mustard brown head. smells of alcohol and rotten apples. malty but unappealing. the flavor is thin and watery but pretty close to a shitty bock. slightly malty, slightly nutty, mostly shitty. nothing interesting about this bomb.
Barrel House Belgian Winter Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Dubbel;Barrel House Brewing Company;Dark brown with a quickly disappating head. Moderate carbonation. Malty nose with some raisons. Flavor is unique. Crystal and special b malt initially, possibly some candi sugar, a tart almost acidic flavor as well. A dry finish. Unique brew, kind of like a lesser version of rodenbach grand cru. Not too bad
Barrel House Belgian Winter Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Dubbel;Barrel House Brewing Company;"This is well carbonated as a reasonably soft pour easily produces almost a four-finger thick, amber tinged, tan colored head in my 25cl tulip glass. The beer is an opaque, concentrated red-amber color as it sits on the table, but shows a clear, cranberry-red color when held up to the light. The aroma is sweet and fruity up front with a kick of toasty malt towards the finish. Aromatic notes evocative of caramelized fruit (prunes, raisins and even a touch of tart tamarind), toffee, a touch of rum-like character (light molasses perhaps) are found up front but seem to not have much staying power. When digging around for a bit some dry, malt driven character is noticeable with touches of toasted crackers, biscuit malt, and a crushed grain character are noticeable. The aroma is fairly appetizing, but somehow does note have a lot of presence after the initial surge of sweet grain / fermentation aromatics. Lightly sweet and definitely a bit tart in the finish; it is not so tart that this is necessarily attributable to an infection, instead it is quite light and certainly pleasant. Fairly light bodied & along with the light body is a bit nicer than suggested by the somewhat sweet aromatic intimations. A toasty malt backbone gets a hint of roastiness to it at times, but mostly reminds me of lightly toasted whole grain bread, and whole grain crackers. Since the sweetness is soft here the fruit flavors are not quite as prominent as suggested in the aroma; this causes the tamarind notes to play a slightly bigger role, but the raisin notes are still pretty noticeable. A nice prickly carbonation couples quite well with the soft mouthfeel & residual body to make this a chewy, yet easy drinking beer; the mix is just about perfect for a Belgian-Dubbel inspired beer. A pretty good beer, the flavor and aroma are nice, but the texture is just about perfect for a beer of this inclination. I do like the dimension that the light tartness adds to this brew, it adds a much needed complexity as I think this beer would be much to shallow without it."
Barrel House Vandermeers 00 Strong Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Barrel House Brewing Company;On tap at Barrel House. Poured deep red-brown, topped by a thin off-white head. Initially, the flavor was quite hoppy (pine) with candy-like sweet malts. Dark fruit, toast, caramel, and a woody aspect developed as I sipped. Rather tart. Needs more character, however. Also, this seemed to be more of an English Strong Ale, not a Belgian Strong Ale.
Barrel House Vandermeers 00 Strong Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Barrel House Brewing Company;rating this from memory, had it a few months back. reminded me alot of a barley wine. very strong and very flavourful. strong malt and hop presence.

Barrel House Nut Brown Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Barrel House Brewing Company;"A fine ""beginner's"" brown ale, I tend to think this brew is underhopped and light on body. Still, it is an enjoyable beer, and I wouldn't hesitate recommending it to friends."
Barrel House Helles Bock;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Barrel House Brewing Company;Draft at Comet with Shigadeyo. Pours a translucent amber with a small off white head. Faint malty aroma. Medium carbonation. Nice toasted malt and bready malt base countered by spicy european hops, which provide a pleasant bite. I agree with Shigadeyo, that it had some mellow whisky or perhaps a mild boozy like charcter to it. Nice beer.
Barrel House Helles Bock;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Barrel House Brewing Company;3/06/2007 at The Comet with illinismitty... Bright, clear, light copper/honey color with a small, foamy beige head. Malt and light fruit to in the aroma. Substantial, but not overpowering malt flavor (slightly toasty) with hints of fruit and a whisky-like character. Supposedly the alcohol content approaches 8% for this beer, but one can’t tell since it’s so well hidden. Smooth on the palate, medium body. This is another impressive Barrel House offering and a really nice and enjoyable session bock beer! 16 oz draught.
Barrel House Helles Bock;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Barrel House Brewing Company;Hazy golden pour with frothy head has a slight nose of straw, sweet caramel, and maple syrup. Palate is very nice with a creamy heft to it. Flavor is rich and deep with a caramel stickiness that is rounded nicely by a hop back. Easy to hoist a few, but a mature character as well.
Barrel House Helles Bock;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Barrel House Brewing Company;On draft in Columbus near OSU campus. Gold, thin head, good lacing, low carbonation. Fruity nose, doughy palate, hoppy finish. Okay, I prefer the german bocks I guess.

Barrel House Doppelbock;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Barrel House Brewing Company;Rating #7 for this beer. . . . . . . . . . . 3/12/2008: Barrel House Doppelbock looks very dark chocolate brown in color with ruby tones. It has an ample tan-colored head that lasts the entire time and leaves some lacing on the glass. The rich, deeply caramelized aroma is inviting. There is roasted malt in the front of the flavor alont with some slight coffee. The caramelized maltiness gives way to a dry and roasty finish. This beer has a medium to medium-bull body. Overall this beer is robust and quite good. Pint (draught) at Dilly Deli in Mariemont, Ohio. Rating: 7/4/7/3/13=3.7 . . . . . . . . . . 3/07/2009: The quality of Barrel House beer has definitely taken a hit lately. The Barrel House Helles bock that I had was at least a full point worse than it was previously. In addition, I was terribly disappointed with this beer as it didn’t even taste any better than the Hudepohl Bock. The alcohol content might haven a slightly higher, but other than that, the deep brown caramel color, dense beige head, bready malty flavor, and smooth creamy body were nearly identical. Barrel House Doppelbock seemed to have a slightly more chocolate-like flavor, but that’s really about it. It’s really hard to support a local brewery when they are brewing sub-par beer! Draught (pint) at Bockfest Hall during Bockfest 2009 in Over-the-Rhine, Cincinnati, Ohio. Rating: 5/3/5/3/11=2.7

Barrel House Doppelbock;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Barrel House Brewing Company;Draft from Fries Cafe. Retired? A thick dark malt body only makes this light caramel, wheat bready concochtion better. Not to bad.
Barrel House Doppelbock;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Barrel House Brewing Company;Yes, this one is nice. Rich and high octane.

Bend High Desert Hefeweizen;Bend, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Bend Brewing Company;Pour is a clear gold with a large white head. Aroma is some wheat malt I guess. Pretty bland.

Bend High Desert Hefeweizen;Bend, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Bend Brewing Company;Meh. Really not impresses with this one.

Palate was medium to light, smooth and pretty drinkable. Overall, the over the top Hefe yeastiness of this was a bit too much for me, tone that down and there would be a pretty nice beer here.

Blind Tiger Raspberry Wheat;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;Probably the third best beer on tap during my visit on 9/3/07, and for a raspberry wheat, that’s usually saying something. Pours a clear light yellow and was served with zero head. The aroma features a nice subtle raspberry with a wheat backing. Unlike many fruit beers, especially raspberry, this one lacks the soapy extract aroma that many exhibit. Light to medium-bodied, slick and clean, this beer highlights nicely balanced raspberry and wheat malt notes. It could probably use a bit more carbonation, but otherwise it’s pretty darn good. I’m not sure if the brewmaster has changed the recipe or if I just hit a better batch, but I thought this one was quite a bit better than many of my predecessor’s ratings would indicate.

Blind Tiger Prairie Dog Brown;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Brown Ale;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;cask-conditioned: Hazy purplish ruby. Loose, foamy bubbles. Soft bed of fruity esters yield notes of blackberry and dried plums. Faintly malty and oxidized with dabs of unsweetened chocolate, cane sugar, yeast, and bushy/tangy hops. Loose carbonation. Slippery body. Twang of leather of plums merge with a brushing burst of earthy hops and underlying cocoa grit. Quickly loses body as it breathes. Light acidity accompanies bready malt textures, which bolster the body. Slightly sweet and yeasty finish with notes of pie crust, dried plums, and smoke. Could use more Crystal and hop coraseness to firm-up the slippery body and soggy maltiness, along with more pale malts to highlight the caramel/chocolate flavors. The nose could also stand to be a tad less unclean/yeasty. For a quick pint, though, this’ll do the trick.

Huge aroma of citric hops dusted with roasted malt. Caramel, moist prunes, soggy teabag, and cocoa whispers. Soft, silky, and chewy. Spicy orange rind assertions combine with a dried plum explosion and their tasty house character to momentarily muffle the malt richness. Leafy hop aspects reside beneath as sappy hop elements creep through to reinforce the beautifully-full body. Minerals and leathery deepen its undeniably unique character. Chalk and burnt cocoa notions add a drying effect to the decadent finish of tar, fudge, caramel, and mocha. Absolutely sublime rendition. Cask version reigns superior by far. (8,4,9,5,17) draft: Relentless, creamy, sticky, rich gray head. Mineral, roasted barley, and toasted cracker aroma. Mild hop fruitiness complements the hints of raisin, caramel, and chocolate cake. Creamy, fluffy body. Medium-bodied. Rich caramel flavors greet the subtle roastiness, which silences most of the acidity. Dried plums come through and balance some of the roastiness. Fluffy blend of caramel and chocolate. Firm mineral notes deter much of the flavorsome malts. Vague airiness retrieves some of the piny hop flavors. Prolonged finish of milk chocolate, cane sugar, cocoa, custard, and burnt malts. Overalll, a bit too acidic, but the rich malt abundance was superb. And thankfully, the nitro didn’t flaw the mouthfeel. Not bad at all. (7,3,7,4,13)

Blind Tiger Russian Imperial Stout;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;"This was not what I was expecting or hoping for, and despite the fact that I think this batch is ""off"", it was still interesting from the standpoint of flavor combinations. Served in a standard shaker, it pours jet black with a thin, creamy, tan head that reduces to a still, oily surface. The aroma is very different from any impy stout that I’ve ever tried: dark chocolate covered strawberries, plums, and faint alcohol blend into a fruity combination. No roast, no coffee. Medium to full-bodied with fine, lightly prickly carbonation coming through the oily texture. It finishes with a lightly dry woodiness. The flavor is of bright, fresh plums and dark, bittersweet chocolate with a fruity/tart, dry, almost woody finish and just a touch of roast at the end. After the first few sips, however, something undeniable and quite bold began to take hold of and dominate the flavor profile: green apple. What a shame. I think that this beer certainly has potential to be great, and from what others have written, other batches have been. I guess I’ll have to wait until next year to find out if I’m right."

Bloomington Freestone Blonde Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Draught at the brewpub. Hardly any aroma, perhaps a touch of lemon cleaner. Clear golden pour, no head. Citric, lightly sour with bg grain notes, not very robust. No real hopping, light-medium body, and on the whole, another boring rendition of a boring style. [2.2] Re-rate over three years later. Bright yellow golden pour, clear, with a small cream-colored head. Sweet nose with light fruitiness and some lemon cleaner and faint yeast. Taste is moderately dry. Cleansing and refreshing despite the weak sauce, it’s plainness isn’t exactly calling me back for a third rate.... [2.7]
Bloomington Freestone Blonde Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Clear straw body, white head. Aroma is mild, medium sweet, light grassy, biscuit. Taste is medium sweet, grassy, light biscuit, mild/medium bitterness. Watery light body. Nice for what it is -- has legit bitterness, hopefully it can help the college kids move past the macros.
Bloomington Freestone Blonde Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;The aroma smelled kind of woody. The body was a medium amber color. The palate was smooth and the flavor was slightly bitter.
Bloomington Freestone Blonde Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Dirty yellow hue with some head and lace. Faint aroma of standard hops and malts, nothing else. Smooth but so is water, bland and boring. Thin-bodied with a watery and fizzy mouthfeel. I'll pass on this, if given the chance.
Bloomington Freestone Blonde Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;"Poured no head and there was no lacing. There was no carbonation observed. It had a sweet aroma to it. It had a bitter taste and an aftertaste that lingered. This brew was watery and thin. I compared it as an American mass-produced beer; however, it was just bit better than a Bud."
Bloomington Freestone Blonde Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;This brew poured a weak transparent yellow orange colored body with a very small head of fine white bubbles. IT has a mild malt-hop aroma and a smooth slightly fizzy bitter start with a lingering hop finish. It also had a weak watery mouth feel to it.
Bloomington Freestone Blonde Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;This one is fairly light in flavor, and not as hoppy as other BBC offerings, though still a nice beer with dinner at their pub.
Bloomington Ruby Bloom Amber Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;On tap at The Brick in South Bend. Pours very red. Flavor is very rich and smooth with a bit of creaminess. Very full bodied well rounded malt flavor - mostly fruity in character with some bready notes. Hopping is just enough to brighten up the finish. Very well crafted beer that I feel is being seriously underrated due to its style.
Bloomington Ruby Bloom Amber Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;bottle. decent amber ale shared with 2 others. very mild beer overall, but good
Bloomington Ruby Bloom Amber Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Reddish/Brown Hue, lively carbonated with a sweet aroma on the nose. This was from a keg not bottle. Starts out with the caramel malt and munich malt as the main players in this beer. smooth taste follows with a slightly bitter finish that lingers until the next sip, Good Amber Ale overall, something I would go back to every now and then.
Bloomington Ruby Bloom Amber Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;A decent amber. Malty and pretty well balanced. Pours darker red, smooth mouthfeel and a caramel body. Tried with Matt and Guy in 2016.
Bloomington Ruby Bloom Amber Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;The problem is that the quality is massively variable in this beer. Sometimes it’s completely flat, sometimes it’s overly carbonated. Sometimes it’s a deep thick red, and sometimes it’s a light clear one. If you get a good batch, it’s amazing, but you really only have a 50/50 chance of that.
Bloomington Ruby Bloom Amber Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Aroma is malty, taste is mellow, malt, very light, not that crisp of a finish.
Bloomington Ruby Bloom Amber Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;bottle @ Whitey’s / Lawrenceburg IN --- (btld 04/16/15) Clear rich brown color, off-white head that drops to a thin cover, hanging strands of lace. Taste is caramel malt that is mildly carbonated, then adds light hops in a medium length finish. The malt has a natural, full-bodied taste and chewy texture. Awfully dark for an Amber Ale, but also polite, inoffensive, and enjoyable.
Bloomington Ruby Bloom Amber Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Sampler pours amber with a off white head. Aroma of malts, grain and dried fruit. Taste is malty and yeast.
Bloomington Ruby Bloom Amber Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Tap...dark garnet pour with a fruity nose. Caramel malt body with ripe dark fruit. Finishes quite clean and somewhat dry. Pretty good.
Bloomington Ruby Bloom Amber Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Old notes - on tap at a restaurant while visiting Bloomington in May, 2014. Amber pour with a small khaki head. Light nuttiness in the aroma, doughy, some caramel and toffee, a little earthy. Plain flavor, I wouldn’t say offensive, some doughy notes, caramel, mild nuttiness. Not bad.
Bloomington Big Stone Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Dry;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Sampler pours black with a brown head. Aroma of chocolate, grains, wood and a hint of burnt malts. Taste is coffee, chocolate and smoky.
Bloomington Big Stone Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Dry;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Aroma of smoke, taste is smokey, lots of bitter coffee, woody, pretty different from what I am used to. Needs more balance.
Bloomington Big Stone Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Dry;Bloomington Brewing Co.;A good basic stout not that great of head. Dark malty. Light smoke. More bitter than the creamy chocolate flavor I crave. Good thickness ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bloomington Big Stone Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Dry;Bloomington Brewing Co.;on tap-brown-black. A-roasty/anise/tobacco/chicory-dk malt. T-roasty/cocoa/anise/tobacco/chicory-dk malt, 2nd earthy hops.
Bloomington Big Stone Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Dry;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Sampled at the Brewpub. It poured a dark brown color with a small tan head. The aroma was of smoked malts, some chocolate, hops and a touch of coffee. The taste was similar with a chocolate overtone with some bitterness and coffee hints. Good stuff.
Bloomington Big Stone Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Dry;Bloomington Brewing Co.;"Draft to taster at Lennies. Looks good; a dark cola with foamy tan head. Smells of dark malt, bitter chocolate, and roast. Tastes like it smells with a touch of smoke and a nice, dry finish. A decent example of the style."
Bloomington Big Stone Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Dry;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Tap at source: Black with a strong, dark brown head. Scent is heavy..sweet chocolate and coffee. Taste is bold, sweet chocolate. Very smooth and creamy. A nice stout....good heavy feel to it...smoky towards the end. A pleasure.
Bloomington Big Stone Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Dry;Bloomington Brewing Co.;tap at the brewpub - Pours very dark brown and has a roast malt and chocolate aroma. It tastes of that roast malt with some hints of coffee and chocolate. It’s medium bodied. Solid stout.
Bloomington Big Stone Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Dry;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Tap. Smoky chocolate malt aroma. Dark brown color with moderate head. Lightly sweet and smoky chocolate malt and mildly bitter herbal hops flavor. Light body. Very nice.
Bloomington Big Stone Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Dry;Bloomington Brewing Co.;On tap at brewpub My final beer of the afternoon was this decent stout. Much better than the porter it is at least worth a revisit when I am not in the mood to tick off something new. Especially at happy hour pricing this is probably one of the better local options without driving south to New Albany or up to Indianapolis. Aroma / Appearance - Reddish black with dark brown edges this beer has a mysterious glow. Loose and fluid it moves around the glass like the final drops of coffee from the bottom of the pot. Anise, plum, and pieces of bacon eat at the air. If you left malts to cool over a pile of cinders it might smell something like this. Flavor / Palate - Black coffee, anise, smoke, and a fluid texture are the hallmarks of this reasonably complex beer. Without trying to overwhelm the senses it throws wave after wave of depth at the senses. Bittersweet chocolate leads to a warm finish of smoky ash. If this is actually close to the 6% ABV on the board it is well done indeed.
Bloomington Java Porter;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Porter;Bloomington Brewing Co.;On draft at Max & Ermas in Eidenburg. The pour is a darker brown/black with a little garnet shining through. There is a thick light tan colored head and a fair bit of lace. The aroma is decent. There is a hefty coffee and roasted malt. The sweetness of a milk sugar and lighter chocolate does pretty well. The flavor is a bit more watery and single dimensioned. The coffee is present but watery with a light hint of chocolate and almost no malt present. The sweetness changes to bitter. The mouth feel is watery and hardly medium bodied with a sharpish carbonation and a lingeringly bitter roasted coffee on the back end. Not bad, but not terrible. 6 4 5 3 12
Bloomington Java Porter;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Porter;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Sampler pours black with a brown head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate and grains. Taste is coffee and nice malts.
Bloomington Java Porter;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Porter;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Draft: Pours black...with a short, tan head. Strong, roast coffee aroma. Creamy chocolate/coffee flavor. Roasty, smoky. Very solid.
Bloomington Java Porter;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Porter;Bloomington Brewing Co.;"Draft to taster at Lennies. Looks good; a cloudy dark brown with beige head. Smells solid; lots of coffee with dark malt notes. Tastes like it smells with a good mouthfeel. Good beer."
Bloomington Java Porter;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Porter;Bloomington Brewing Co.;"Aroma of bitter, chalky coffee, some chocolate. Appearance is garnet black with bone head. Flavor matches the nose; the coffee has a ""spent"" taste and is generally unpleasant. Palate is medium, chewy and soft. Needs work."
Bloomington Java Porter;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Porter;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Tap. Coffee and chocolate malt aroma. Dark brown color with small head. Slightly sweet chocolate malt and lightly bitter ash/herb flavor. Body a bit light. A nice drinkable beer.
Bloomington Java Porter;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Porter;Bloomington Brewing Co.;On tap at brewpub Moving on to the porters and stouts I was less impressed with what came at the end of the flight. While they weren’t terrible they just felt like they were lacking something that gave them an edge over any other beer brewed to a paint by numbers recipe. Even so it isn’t a bad fallback. Aroma / Appearance - Reddish black with spindly legs the beer slips down the sides slowly. Black coffee, ash, and a dry smoky malt bill nibble at the senses but never are strong enough to attract a bite. Flavor / Palate - Thin in the mouthfeel the texture is a bit watery. Like coffee left too long in the pot it has a strong bite. The taste of day old coffee proceeds to linger for a while before fading slowly. Average to slightly below average this is not the best example of a porter to use when trying to determine the good from the bad.
Bloomington Java Porter;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Porter;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Had this on tap at Lennies along with lunch. Not much head. Very dark porter. Aroma was coffee and maybe some chocolate in there. The flavor is similar to the aroma, although the roasted flavor comes through. Seemed pretty well balanced. Good, drinkable porter. The ABV is 5.0. Sumatran coffee beans are used.
Bloomington Java Porter;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Porter;Bloomington Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub. Wish this one had been on cask, but enjoyed it even so. Oily dark pour, with a thin but persistent head and nice lacing. Soft mellow chocolate and bitter bean in the nose. Perhaps a bit too one-dimensionally bitter in the taste, at the expense of coffee’s deeper and more subtle qualities, but there were enough choc malts and hops to balance things out. Not bad.
Bloomington Java Porter;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Porter;Bloomington Brewing Co.;On tap at Lennies / Bloomington Brewing Co on 14 March 2010. No ABV stated. Dark brown colour. Looks rather cloudy but too dark to see clearly. Lots of coffee. Rather dry mouthfeel. Some burnt bitterness. Slightly thin and maybe lacks a little depth but, overall, pretty decent.
Bloomington B-Town Brown Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Draught at Lennie’s. Rub/ychestnut highlights on a dark brown/black body with minimal beige head. Nose is nice and roasty, light chocolate, some nice tar, mild tobacco, but a touch too sweet. Light body, nicely bittersweet despite the apparent absence of hops/IBUs, faint chocolate, etc. A nice little dirty porter, but too sweet and missing the chance of packing in more roast and depth (nutty undertones would be nice here).
Bloomington B-Town Brown Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Copper color with a tan head. Mild roasty, nutty, caramel aroma. Medium body. Decent flavor is roasted nuts with sweet caramel malt with some spices. Nicely bitter finish.
Bloomington B-Town Brown Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;Not a bad beer at all! Pours deep brown, transparent, minor head. Aroma is chocolate, caramel. Similar flavor profiles with a moderate mouth feel.

Bonnema Pozo Pale Ale;Atascadero, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bonnema Brewing Company;Body is amber with a very thin light head. Aroma is centennial hops, with a bit of caramel and honey, light pleasant aroma. Taste is a sweet hoppiness which is much like the aroma but a little sweeter which fades into a light hop bitterness.

Bonnema Red Kroeker Ale;Atascadero, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bonnema Brewing Company;Bottle from Richard. Reddish colored pour, no head. Smell is malty and sweet. Taste is similar, with no real body or much of anything here. Pretty bland actually. Probably not something I would want to get again.
Bonnema Red Kroeker Ale;Atascadero, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bonnema Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle via trade with IrishBoy - Pours a clear amber color with a small off white head which faded quickly. Light spotty lacing. Has a light caramel malt aroma and flavor. Medium body. Worth a try. Thanks Richard.
Bonnema Red Kroeker Ale;Atascadero, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bonnema Brewing Company;Thanks again to IrishBoy for sending this my way. A very nice dark red body with a very thin lacing of white head. Nice aroma, sweet... almost milky-like, hops and malt with a light fruit presence. Taste of caramel, some light hops... maybe some chocolate powder, very interesting. Slightly sweet and smooth ending, not offensive at all, subtle.
Bonnema Red Kroeker Ale;Atascadero, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bonnema Brewing Company;(yet another free bottle from irishboy...thanks!)clear amber with not much head.caramel and bananas dominate the aroma.flavor is a strange mix of bananas,chocolate,metal,and tobacco.
Bonnema Red Kroeker Ale;Atascadero, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bonnema Brewing Company;Caramel, with hazelnut, and malt in the aroma. Taste is nutty with caramel, not a lot of depth to it by any means, but it’s not bad. Much more like a brown rather then a red, or bitter.
Bonnema Red Kroeker Ale;Atascadero, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bonnema Brewing Company;"Bottle from Albertsons supermarket in Atascadero, CA; Nose is bitter, not hoppy with some spice notes; Rusty colored with a tiny beige head; flavor shows spicy and some bitterness, with the flavor of an oily fat added that i’ve never seen in beer before. I can see where the first rater wanted to compare it to beef, it might have a light beef bullion note, but not a major flavor. Unique beer taste!"
Bonnema Red Kroeker Ale;Atascadero, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bonnema Brewing Company;I see why this beer was awarded 1st place gold medal in Sacramento Ca. 2003
Bonnema Red Kroeker Ale;Atascadero, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bonnema Brewing Company;My second beer of the night with an odd aroma. I swear it smells and tastes like spiced beef. Nice mild bitter tones to this beer, and a crisp dry finish. The beef flavor kinda ruined the experience for me though. The color was a pretty red color.
Bonnema Mudhole Porter;Atascadero, California, United States;Porter;Bonnema Brewing Company;Dark and very rich, creamy head, with a roasty hint in the finish, not a bitter porter, very enjoyable I would recomend
Boyne River Log Jam Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boyne River Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle labeled Everett’s Ale and EK Ale. Dark amber pour. Short, off-white head. The aroma is weak, but does have notes of sweet grain and caramel. The flavor was moderately sweet and slightly bitter. Light acidity. Medium body. The finish was chalky. Drinkable, but unremarkable — perhaps too much past its prime.
Boyne River Log Jam Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boyne River Brewing Company;"12 oz. bottled labeled ""Everett’s Ale"" - this is the closest to the bottles listed and I am not going to enter a new beer for a closed brewery: Pours a crystal clear amber with a thin cap. The nose is subtle, with sweet bread and caramel. The body is thin, but good, with lingering notes of nutty caramel and toffee. Hop presence is limited, but this bottle may be a bit dated."
Boyne River Log Jam Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boyne River Brewing Company;12oz - Aroma of cherry and malt. Transparent amber color with no head or lacing. An interesting flavor that is sweet and cherry jolly rancher like. I was not expecting it and surprised that I like it. Smooth palate. Not sure how old this one is.

Boyne River Log Jam Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boyne River Brewing Company;Maple/mahogoney/carmel color. Some carbonation. Soft mouthfeel. Yeah, like the DrBeer, it's dry. Not bitter enough.

Boyne River Pale Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boyne River Brewing Company;Light brown/amber in color. Lots of sweet, floral notes and also a slight tang. My label is also different and looks very new. Loving in Michigan lately I have seen Boyne River beer at a number of stores, even though they have been out of business for a while. Enjoyable and well crafter beer.
Boyne River Pale Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boyne River Brewing Company;Hazy, light brown iced-tea color. Fairly white head. Nice hoppy aroma, some Cascades maybe, but hidden behind some other English hops. Same in the flavor, but there is some bubble gum sweetness and chewiness to this brew. Like crazy-man-behind-the-mask says, the label I have is quite a bit different. Also, they seem very new. However, I'm drinking this 4 months later.
Boyne River Pale Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boyne River Brewing Company;Fruity hop nose and cloudy peach color. Flavor is a lot like Anderson Valley Pale Ale, but fitted in a slimmer frame. This finish has a bit of citrict sourness. This might be the last rating of this beer, now extinct. Thanks Psych Prof for this tremendous artifact.
Boyne River Pale Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boyne River Brewing Company;Brownish Orange. Big head with some lace as the pint is diminished. Big American cascade nose. Biscuit aroma. Awesome balance of hops and malt in aroma and flavor. A truly excellent American Pale Ale. My favorite from Boyne River. Update: Picked up a bottle still on the shelves at Horrock's in Battle Creek, MI. This beer is starting to lose some of its luster. Still nice but not quite as brilliant as it once was.
Boyne River Pale Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boyne River Brewing Company;"Very cloudy light brown color. Nose is floral (cascades?) and piney with some sweet malty notes as well. Balance is very much to my liking; walks a fine line between malty sweetness and hop bitterness. I'm not the world's biggest APA fan, but I did enjoy this brew."
Boyne River Pale Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boyne River Brewing Company;My bottle is quite hoppy (though reading the other reviews suggests that's not something you can count on), with good graprefruit flavor dominant. Also some pine hops and a bit of yeast. Some sweet maltiness creeps in as part of the aftertaste. I could be happy with this as a session beer, if only the brewery weren't going away. Thanks PsychProf, for bringing it to Toronto.
Boyne River Pale Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boyne River Brewing Company;Light frothy head, yellow-orange cloudy color. Well balanced, not as hoppy as I expected, refreshing lemon-citrusy aroma and flavor, I like this pale, thanks PsychProf.

Boyne River Pale Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boyne River Brewing Company;Average Pale Ale. I would of liked it better with more hops thrown in. Easy drinking though.
Boyne River Brown Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Boyne River Brewing Company;Toffee, butter, and toast in the nose with a thin white head on an amber body. Light biscuty malts with toffee. Finishes with toasted butter and more malts thta turn to caramel. Stood up to time real well.
Boyne River Brown Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Boyne River Brewing Company;"This was an ’01. The aroma was dark fruit, slightly tea, butter, slight roast, and citrus notes. The flavor was thin, and watery tea textures, slight roast, citrus, and buttery notes. The beer poured a cloudy brown color w/ golden orange highlights; thin head and lacing. THe mouthfeel was light bodied and creamy w/ a wet finish."
Boyne River Brown Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Boyne River Brewing Company;Chesnut color with a nice tight white head. Aroma is malty and nutty. Smooth mouth feel. Touches of roasted malts and nutty flavors. Some bitter hops in the finish. Pretty solid brown ale.
Boyne River Brown Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Boyne River Brewing Company;I thought this was a pretty decent brown. The clear brown elixir is topped by a little head with some lacing left behind. The aroma is slightly sweet and malty with roasty, nutty notes. The flavor is virtually the same as the aroma but with some hoppy notes. Medium bodied, smooth and slightly dry.
Boyne River Brown Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Boyne River Brewing Company;um? I don't get it? light clear brown with a lasting head..malty, lightly chocolatey aroma..light body with the same old subtle malt and chocolate flavors..how good can a brown ale be anyway...uh oh, was i supposed to be rating by style? I forgot.
Boyne River Brown Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Boyne River Brewing Company;This is a very light bodied that has a nice roasty nose but a lot more bitter than I'd like to see in a brown.
Boyne River Brown Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Boyne River Brewing Company;Dark earthy brown pour with a very nice roasty nose. Light body, nice roasted malt front with a little nuttiness to it. Fairly sizable bitterness in the finish for a brown.
Boyne River Brown Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Boyne River Brewing Company;A moderate brown color with a mildly foamy head. Smells much like a bowl of holiday nuts. Has a very average fully nutty body to it.
Boyne River Brown Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Boyne River Brewing Company;Good Nut Brown. Translucent brown color with a small white head. Aroma is nutty and malty. Flavor is fairly malt sweet, with slight bitterness. Thin bodied, balance finish.

Boyne River Lake Trout Stout;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Stout;Boyne River Brewing Company;Pours a dark brownish black color with a thick sudsy tan head. It leaves some thick laceing along the sides of the glass. The nose is nice and roasted, you can really smell the toasted barley and chocolate malt. The flavor is nice and roasted with a lot or earth exploding in your mouth and it leaves this tangy bitterness that is also smooth and semi sweet on the side walls of your mouth. Overall it is nice and flavorful with a finish that is all right could use some more carbonation though.
Boyne River Lake Trout Stout;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Stout;Boyne River Brewing Company;Pours a near black clolour with ruby edges and a massive, rocky mocha head that dimples as it fades. It has insane head retention and lacing that coats the glass with thick. The nose is muted coffee and chocolate and not much else. There are some tin-like notes as well. The flavour is roasty, citric, and has notes of coffee, peppery spice and some light fruits. The palate is watery, harshly carbonated and harshly bitter. Not a great stout.
Boyne River Lake Trout Stout;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Stout;Boyne River Brewing Company;Pours as light as it tastes. Very thin, and leaves no lasting taste in the mouth.
Boyne River Lake Trout Stout;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Stout;Boyne River Brewing Company;Pretty good stout, little on the lighter side for me, but not bad. Had the typical coffe-chocolate aroma and flavors.
Boyne River Lake Trout Stout;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Stout;Boyne River Brewing Company;Thick roasted coffee aroma. Body starts sweet and roasty with some smoke and a salty fish(?) finish. Thick oily palate delivers the flavor. This has perhaps aged too long, but I bet it was a pretty good brew in its day.
Boyne River Lake Trout Stout;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Stout;Boyne River Brewing Company;Dark with a medium off-white head. Roasted malts, silkly mouthfeel. Rush of bitter dryness and accenuated roasted malts during the finish.
Boyne River Lake Trout Stout;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Stout;Boyne River Brewing Company;"22 oz bomber (I know, like I could get it on tap now) courtesy of Psychprof. Medium quick-dying head, black. Roasty chocolate coffee aroma, nothing unusual and rather weak -- could be result of age I suppose. Nice bitter chocolate flavor, pleasant but not what I would call intense; sort of a ""lighter"" stout, not my cup of tea entirely but so very drinkable; I could probably do 2 of these in a night without breaking a sweat and there aren't a lot of stouts I'd want to say that about.

Boyne River Lake Trout Stout;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Stout;Boyne River Brewing Company;Dark brown, fairly light colored for a stout. Ring of white bubbles, again fairly light. Thought this might be heading in the wrong direction for a stout then the HUGE roasted aroma hit me. Sweet aroma of milk chocolate, toast, coffee, burnt stuff, faint fruit (concord grape), and a faint smoke/wood that catches p with you at the end. Semi dry flavor with a burnt finish. A little light on the palate, but a fine stout.
Boyne River Lake Trout Stout;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Stout;Boyne River Brewing Company;Dark black in color. Distinguished roast taste to the favor. Not much else. Decent stout.
Boyne River Lake Trout Stout;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Stout;Boyne River Brewing Company;One of the few stouts that I could drink all night long -- not too much body that you get tired of it after a while.
Boyne River Oatmeal Stout;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Stout;Boyne River Brewing Company;Crazy ass 1 liter swing top bottle seemed to protect this beer from the ravages of time. I don’t know what black hole and/or time warp yjb pulled this one out from, but it was well worth the effort! Dark cola brown with a dense creamy tan head. Lghtly sweet round malt. Light cola acidity from roast. Chocolate is light. Low carbonation. Thin body, very quaffable. Lightly sweet, big vanilla. Subdued chocolate. A bit like vanilla coke, only much better. Rather clear with a bit of that oatmealiness. Really doesn’t taste old, but judging from the age of these ratings... anyways, must have either been kept in great condition or the age helped this beer out!
Boyne River Oatmeal Stout;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Stout;Boyne River Brewing Company;I was really looking forward to trying this stout, but was sadly disappointed. I assumed that the people who brought us Boyne River Brown Ale would be able to make a decent stout. If you like the combination of cherry cough syrup and coffee, this is the stout for you. I must admit it had a beautiful deep ruby color.
Boyne River Oatmeal Stout;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Stout;Boyne River Brewing Company;Well, I can't say I'm a huge fan yet, but I intend to have a few more. The thing comes on strong with cherry syrupy flavors and pours a nice dark ruby color.
Boyne River Hefe Weizen;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boyne River Brewing Company;A nice find in a 750 mL bottle. Not sure when this was bottled. Tangy wheat aroma with a hint of cloves. Cloudy yellow-orange body with a thin off-white head. Nice flavor reminded me more of a typical American Wheat than a Hefeweizen: fruity and light with strong wheat tang and estery notes. Nice mouthfeel due to tight carbonation. Too bad Boyne River is out of business, but these bottles of Hefeweizen are still solid.
Boyne River Hefe Weizen;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boyne River Brewing Company;Crystal clear straw color with large head. Spicy wheat aroma with some citrus notes.

Boyne River Hefe Weizen;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boyne River Brewing Company;This hefe weizen has a wonderfully citrusy nose which is unfortunately not carried out in the flavor. I tend to prefer very citrusy hefe weizens, but still enjoyed the complexity of this one.
Boyne River Hefe Weizen;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boyne River Brewing Company;Excellent nose - spicy and estery, and this carries, though more faintly, into the taste, with a splash of bitter and citrus action on close. A decent Hefe on a decent summer day in the home of laid back ales. Stay tuned for a RateBeer article on the place from yours truly.

Taste starts with a hint of cocoa up front fading quickly to mildly roasty body, smooth, with a bigger bitter finish. This brew didn’t remind me of an amber at all, but was to thin to be the stout.

Aromas of banana and citrus (lemon) and wheat bread. This is decidedly not an American-style wheat. Light-bodied, crisp and clean.

A deep wheat flavor and a hint of banana and cloe in the flavor and nose. This was a great brew to drink I liked it. No lemon needed this was a beer with some flavor.
Cascade Lakes Weiss;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;Pale golden. Aroma is very wheaty with notes of lemons, bananas, bread and more wheat. Nice tart finish. This one offered way more than the American wheats from the other 2 Bend brewers I visited.
Cascade Lakes Weiss;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;A very light version of this style, it really needs alot more body and maltiness. Zingy lemony acidity, light bodied and very clean, with some light banana flavors. Could be alot better.

Cascade Lakes Weiss;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;(Draft: Seventh Street Brewhouse in Redmond, OR) Spicy and wheaty nose, with modest banana and clove, this seems like a far cry from the typically bland American wheat beers. The flavor features a moderate wheat base, mild citrus, a light spiciness and a hint of banana. Light bodied, but clean and refreshing on this hot Oregon day. Pale straw color, hard to get much paler, somewhat cloudy in appearance, with a slowly-fading snow white head, and patchy lacing on the glass. Light and easy to drink, but a quality wheat beer.

Cascade Lakes India Pale Ale;Redmond, Oregon, United States;IPA;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;Bottle: Clear copper color with a small head and white ring around the edge. Carbonation seems pretty lively. Hoppy aroma but not huge, a little skunk, and wet grass. Flavor pretty well balanced. Hops up front with a maltier aftertaste than most IPA’s. I did notice a floral character in the flavor as well. Ok, I like a more in your face IPA than this.

Cascade Lakes India Pale Ale;Redmond, Oregon, United States;IPA;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;Draught at the brewhouse in Redmond. Dark gold to pale amber with a very stable head. The aroma is mostly dank, fruity, grapefruit peel hops that come off pretty fresh, but there is also an odd, unclean, alcoholic edge that muddles things a little. Resiny hop flavor quickly leads to a rough, astringently bitter finish that doesn’t really have and malt for balance. The body is thin and astringent, leaving an uncomfortable feeling. Bitterness needs to be scaled back significantly here.
Cascade Lakes India Pale Ale;Redmond, Oregon, United States;IPA;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;Mix of citrus and skunky hops, though a definite pale malt presence, which continues in the flavor, hopes on the harsh side but not intensely so. Good weight in the mouth. Quite yellow with a foamy head that lasts and laces. Dry bitter finish.

Typical of this style there is not a lot going on. Some soft grass and grain. Soft malts. Light fruit and a dry bitterness.
Coddington Golden Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coddington Brewing Company;Clear yellow pour. Mild malt and hops. Maybe a bit of grain. Goes for both the aroma and taste. Would enjoy it doing yardwork.

The aroma was of hops, dough and earth. The taste was similar to the aroma with more hops, dough, earth with medium carbonation and a different aftertaste. Ok.
Coddington India Pale Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;IPA - English;Coddington Brewing Company;At the source: pours caramel with a white head. Aroma is bready with a hint of hops. Taste is not an IPA. This is not good. My wife hates this beer... so does my brother. What?
Coddington India Pale Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;IPA - English;Coddington Brewing Company;Draft sample at the source. The beer is a clear copper with a white head of foam. Crisp herbal bitterness. Dry and floral. Sweet and mildly bitter. Medium body and medium carbonation.
Coddington India Pale Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;IPA - English;Coddington Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub. English earthy malts, clear orange pour, lightly hopped. Not really my type of IPA.

Coddington India Pale Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;IPA - English;Coddington Brewing Company;On tap at the source, Slightly hazy golden amber color, faint sweet bread and caramel, light earthy hop with a hint of astringency. Decent ipa but needs more hops
Coddington India Pale Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;IPA - English;Coddington Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewpub. Amber golden with a nice long lasting creamy layer. A sweet malt aroma. Floral? The flavor is also sweet malts to begin and then is floral and citrus. More citrus comes lateand it is accompanied by tropical fruit. Soon that dominates. Those malts continue to make this sweet. I like it.
Coddington India Pale Ale;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;IPA - English;Coddington Brewing Company;Clear copper pour. Aroma is citrus rind with white pulp. Taste is grapefruit rind. Enjoyable.

Coddington Vienna Lager;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coddington Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. I was excited to try this beer, because I hadn’t had a Veinna for a long time and wanted to settle into some rich, toasted maltiness. Instead, I got a confusing and odd arrangement of unclean lager brewing and paleness. Poured very hazy and in kind of a strawberry blonde color. Aroma was subtly a pinch of raw grain (this runs throughout the brewpub’s offerings) and some unbaked bread dough. Then a weird mineral-heavy wash of what just seems like lager yeast gone wrong. Not attractive.
Coddington Vienna Lager;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coddington Brewing Company;Pours a amber color with a thin white head. Flavors of roasty malt and caramel. Not a bad beer and could drink a few of these if I had to.
Coddington Vienna Lager;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coddington Brewing Company;On draft at the brewery. The pour does not match the commercial description, as it was pale, almost straw pale. The nose was pungent, toasted grains, honey and grass. The flavour was similar, with honey sweetness dominating and some dry, bitter hops that finished somewhat medicinal. The mouthfeel was slick, sharply carbonated and relatively full-bodied for the style. For such a low abv, alcohol presence was rather high. Either this was an infected batch, or they could have done a better job with this offering, but Vienna’s just aren’t really my bag, so I’m biassed.
Coddington Vienna Lager;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coddington Brewing Company;this was a well balanced beer. Easy to drink and full of flavor. Had it on Goat Island in RI. Next time I’m up I will go the to brewery to sample a few more.
Coddington Irish Stout;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Dry;Coddington Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. It poured a dark red color with an off-white head. The aroma was of malts, roast and coffee. The taste was similar to the aroma with more malts, roast, coffee with medium carbonation and a nice aftertaste. Decent.
Coddington Irish Stout;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Dry;Coddington Brewing Company;At the source: very light dry stout. Not much going on here. Drinkable, however.
Coddington Irish Stout;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Dry;Coddington Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub. Very dark brown pour with a rich dense tan head. Roasted malt, hint of coffee, softer palate. Good beer.
Coddington Irish Stout;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Dry;Coddington Brewing Company;On tap at the source, Solid black color decent tan head. Roasty grainy earthy. Nice dry stout
Coddington Irish Stout;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Dry;Coddington Brewing Company;Black pour with light tan head. Aroma is mild coffee. Taste is sweet coffee followed by immediate bitter.
Coddington Irish Stout;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Dry;Coddington Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub on 7/3/13. Clear dark reddish brown in color with a thick beige head. Aroma of malt, roast and molasses. Malty and caramelly flavor with some chocolate before a dry, roasty finish.
Coddington Irish Stout;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Dry;Coddington Brewing Company;An overlooked gem? Not a brew by numbers beer, some smoked malt, some anise baltic porter notes and a rich creamy feel packed into a tight 3.4% body. Nice concept and execution. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Coddington Irish Stout;Middletown, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Dry;Coddington Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours black with a thick tan head. Aroma of roasted sweet malt and a hint of roasted malt. Flavor is thin, chalky and roasted/charred malt. Not too bad, I was expecting worse given prior ratings. But the palate is pretty decent with lots of charred, roasty malt. Overall, a dry stout I enjoyed. 7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)
Copper Canyon Foothills Blonde Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);"Draught at the source. Pale straw color; slight, but not too hazy. Yeasty, bready aroma. Wheat flavor, malty and smooth. No citrus notes. Light bodied but not thin. Well done beer."
Copper Canyon Foothills Blonde Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);On tap. Clear light golden in colour with no head. Thin and very sharp feel in the mouth. Slightly hoppy and very anonomous. May have been slightly infected.
Copper Canyon Foothills Blonde Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);tap at brewery-man, this place is a riot! its a mulletfest in the middle of a pretty nice area. pours pale yellow with a nice whtie head and good lacing from the start. grainy aroma with some subtle notes of hops. some sweet flavors from alot of pale malt, but no spicy hop notes that i was expecting. some grain in the finish as well. pretty boring.
Copper Canyon Foothills Blonde Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Pours a very pale, straw color with a wispy pale head that sits atop this quite clear beer. There is a hint of spicy hops and subtle malt in the nose, but just barely. The taste is light and quite fruity with notes of strawberry and tropical fruit. This is certainly not fruity like a Belgian beer, but more than I was expecting, though not much more than your standard Blonde ale. There is barely a hint of hops and malt in the taste. Overall a bland unexciting beer.
Copper Canyon Foothills Blonde Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Sweet malt and citrus aroma and flavor with a watery body with a light hops finish.
Copper Canyon Foothills Blonde Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Smapler. Gold color for body. Well the beer was cold and wet. Could of had a Miller Lite, not much difference
Copper Canyon Foothills Blonde Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);I'm more into heavier beers, but this blonde surprised me. Refreshing and flavorful.
Copper Canyon Foothills Blonde Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);"I do beer quest to several breweies and brewpubs on a regular basis, this is a favorite stop for me. this particular beer is a little light for this heavy duty ""gusler"", good training wheel beer. Fair malts and hops, quite clean and refreshing."
Copper Canyon Amber Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Backlog, from notes. On tap @ the brewpub, 22 May 2001. Starts out OK, enough aroma’s - malty sweetness & hops, but soon becomes bland, with a rather neutral taste and nothing going on in the finish.
Copper Canyon Amber Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);On tap. Clear golden in colour with no head. Feels thin. Slightly hoppy and slightly malty and a somewhat dry finish.
Copper Canyon Amber Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);tap at the brewpub-flacoalto nailed my first comments on this beer-no head and no aroma to speak of. I almost snorted this beer while trying to get an aroma. pretty boring beer we hvae here-pours a copper hue with no head. no aroma as i stated. flavors are really off-caramel apple. this has been sitting on the tapper for a long time.
Copper Canyon Amber Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);This beer is a brilliantly clear light copper color and it has no head on it. I can’t really pick up anything in the aroma of this beer, it is like smelling water. The taste is lightly sweet, and is pretty light on the palate as well. There is a hint of a caramel note to it, and this is joined by a hint of spicy hops in the finish. Again there is really not much here, though there is perhaps a bit of bitterness in the finish.
Copper Canyon Amber Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Copper color with a very small head and lacing. Aroma and flavor of light malt with a watery body.
Copper Canyon Amber Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Sampler. More of a darker gold color. Some musty malt aroma. Tatste well man thought this one was watered down abit.
Copper Canyon Amber Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);This beer, and others from this brewery, are certainly better than anything BMC has to offer, but nothing to write home about. This amber ale is clear, dark yellow w/ a slightly malty flavor. There isn't much more to it than that. It's a fairly benign beer, but nothing special.
Copper Canyon Amber Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Light for an amber, but decent maltiness and body...........................
Copper Canyon Amber Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Good beer as ambers go, decent malts and a fair hop floral nose. Medium bodied and decent flavor, a step up from thier Blond Ale.
Copper Canyon Amber Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);............................................................................
Copper Canyon Arizona Pale Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);On tap. Clear light ambercoloured with no head. Hoppy and slightly malty. Grassy notes that leads to a bit of a dry finish.
Copper Canyon Arizona Pale Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);tap at brewery. pours an orange hue with great cascading lacing from a white head. citric hop notes in the aroma with tones of pineapple, grapefruit, and some grainy malts. subtle tangerine note as well. taste is very jucy, with all these citric notes coming out. light oxidization but not offensive. pretty good munich malt base here. this beer is pretty solid and a step away from something great.
Copper Canyon Arizona Pale Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);This beer is a clear copper-amber color, it has a ring of a pale head around the glass. There is a slight aroma of citrus here, most notably grapefruit. The taste is light and off-dry, but it has a nice tingling bitterness to it that is evident on my tongue. There is a malty caramel note in the finish that is quite nice, though it is subtle. I get notes of lemon, currants, and pine. This is one of the better beers here.
Copper Canyon Arizona Pale Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Dark amber with a nice thick white head and lacing in the pint glass. Flavor of malt and lots off hops. Flavor was all hops, citrus and grapefruit. Very good IPA.
Copper Canyon Arizona Pale Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Sampler. Well will have to go back and get a full glass because this one tasted just like the Amber Ale, watery. Maybe the bar maid gave me two of the same beers in my sampler.
Copper Canyon Arizona Pale Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);I had this at the Great Arizona Beer Festival in Phoenix. It was nothing special.
Copper Canyon Arizona Pale Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Decent beer. Not the best pale ale, but not the worst. Good hoppy taste and smell.
Copper Canyon Arizona Pale Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);THis beer is listed as an IPA on Copper Canyon's menu & I'd have to agree. Definitely some citrus/grapefruity hoppy nose & taste going on here. It is a clear golden color w/ a decent hoppy/citrus nose & flavor. It is a respectable west coast IPA. Nice, but not outstanding.
Copper Canyon Arizona Pale Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Great hop flavor and bitterness. By far the best Copper Canyon beer........
Copper Canyon Arizona Pale Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Now we are getting someplace, the IBU's are climbing. Hops and more hops in this beer, but to be fair there is a nice malt sweetness that lingers under my hops.
Copper Canyon Jackrabbit IPA;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Backlog, from notes. On tap @ the brewpub, 22 May 2001. Hoppy aroma, with some malty sweetness & fruits. Flavor is getting there: nice moderate hop bitter. Finish is full on bitter. OK!
Copper Canyon Jackrabbit IPA;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Her we go. After my sampler plater was complete I had a full glass of this one. Had a good floral aroma. Copper color body with of white head some lacing. Had a decent citrus flavor. Good balance to this one refreshing yet a little dry finish. Best beer of the place.
Copper Canyon Jackrabbit IPA;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Draught @ the 5th Annual Strong Beer Festival in Scottsdale, Arizona. Orange in color with a large and dense head of foam. An aroma of hops mainly, with hints of apricot, pine and grain, nuts and cereal. Very dry and hoppy (lemon, grass, apricot, pine) with a miserable amount of malt contribution (grain) and a lingering finish. Not very good, quite honestly.
Copper Canyon Jackrabbit IPA;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);"A very good IPA. Once again, Copper Canyon is true to style with color, aroma, appearance, etc. It did seem to add a little more hop punch than ""standard"" IPAs."
Copper Canyon Jackrabbit IPA;Chandler, Arizona, United States;IPA;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);3rd on my list of style favorites are IPA's, if there's a problem with this beer is that it's not always available. Big hop floral nose and a decent malt grainy sweetness that balances nicely, If it's available, and you like IPA's you will like it big time.
Copper Canyon Leapin Lizard Light Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Good beer, for beginners, way to light for me. Decent in all respects. to me minimal hops and malts, but clean and crisp.
Copper Canyon rAZbeery Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Draught at the pub. Golden color with a pinkish hue. Aroma is raspberry and slight hops. This beer actually has a strong malt background, some complexity, maybe a british variety added. Raspberry flavor is up front but not overwhelming or syrupy. Not very tart, semi-dry. Good enough for a second one. Refreshing.
Copper Canyon rAZbeery Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);On tap. Clear light pinkish in colour with no head. Totally sweet and sticky. Rasberry and a bit hoppy in flavour - oh and did I mention sweet? Feels a bit sharp.
Copper Canyon rAZbeery Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);tap at brewery-pours a golden yellow with a pink tinge as well from the flavoring. some good lacing and head retention i must say. raspberry cough surup aroma, but not that offensive honestly. flavors are sweet raspberry and a fizzy carbonation makes this beer pretty dry. not bad and not offensive for what it is. the chic beer for the mullets!
Copper Canyon rAZbeery Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);This beer is a clear light copper color and it has a wispy pale head on it. There is a hint of raspberry color to the beer as well. The aroma is dominated by a strong raspberry note, and nothing else. The beer is pretty dry, which helps to keep the dominant raspberry note in check. There is also a slight acidity in the finish, which seems to be from the raspberries. This beer is certainly dominated by the raspberry notes, not much else here. If this was sweet I would most likely hate this as it would be too much with the raspberry and all, luckily it is just dry enough to be drinkable.
Copper Canyon rAZbeery Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Very odd tasting beer. Aroma of raspberry with a very watery body. Flavor started with raspberry but finishe with the heavy taste of handcream on the palate. Blah!
Copper Canyon rAZbeery Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Aroma is of raspberry. Flavor was watery raspberry maybe I just had the worst sampler that any one has rated. Not to impressed.
Copper Canyon rAZbeery Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Usually, raspberries impart a tart/sweet combination that can work well in beers. In this case, they didn't. It does have a nice raspberry aroma and, it isn't a bad looking beer, BUT it tasted like a sweet raspberry soda. If you've ever had one of those Hansen's fruit sodas, then you know what this beer tastes like.
Copper Canyon rAZbeery Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Too tart and absolutely no body. I'm not a big fan of fruit beers, but this is worse than average for that style.
Copper Canyon rAZbeery Ale;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Beeter than average fruit beer. Tart and crisp, the hops add a lot to this beer, great aroma and fine fruit and malt flavors.
Copper Canyon Penta-Yum Porter;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Porter;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);tap at brewpub-this beer poured dark brown with a fizzy beige head. some roast, char and mocha aromas that were match one for one on the flavors. this beer is pretty heavy on the roast and not enough on the chocolate. pretty one dimensional, but not bad. body is fluffy and has a good mouthfeal. actually, this beer scored a little better than the red, but i liked the red better.
Copper Canyon Penta-Yum Porter;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Porter;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);This beer is a clear brown-amber color and it is topped by a thin wispy light brown head. Again the aroma is quite muted here. Finally though I have found a little bit of flavor in one of these beers. There are some good notes of chocolate to this porter. This beer is light on the palate, thought this is the thickest beer that I have had from this brewery. There is a soft sweetness that accompanies the dominant chocolate note. There is some soft fruitiness here as well, I get notes of currants, raisin, caramel and some toasted malt notes. There is a bit of bitterness in the finish, which seems to be a combination of hops and dark malt.
Copper Canyon Penta-Yum Porter;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Porter;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Black with a decent head. Roasyy malt and coffee aroma and rich roasty flavor. A bit to thin but worth a full glass.
Copper Canyon Penta-Yum Porter;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Porter;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);This was actually the first one that got my attention on the sampler plater. Had the sweet malty aroma of a porter. Dark body. Rich malty sweet flavor. Not to bad of beer. Worth a full glass sometime.
Copper Canyon Penta-Yum Porter;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Porter;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);A nice, robust porter bursting at the seams with roasty flavors and aromas. Coffee, toffee, some grassy hops at the end. It warmed to become vinous.
Copper Canyon Penta-Yum Porter;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Porter;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);This porter is light/medium bodied and brown colored. It's not transparent, but you can certainly see more than what you would in a typical porter. It did have a nice roasty-toasty nose and flavor, but the thin body did a take a bit away from it, IMHO.
Copper Canyon Penta-Yum Porter;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Porter;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);The pour creates a full, white head. no lacing to speak of. Dark ruby (when held to light) color. Slightly sweet nose, no aromas that stand out. Flavor is full and roasty. Nice coffee finish. Thin palate. Worth getting again and trying the others.
Copper Canyon Penta-Yum Porter;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Porter;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Great head, good lace. Dark brown as expected, very smooth with deep coffee undertones.
Copper Canyon Penta-Yum Porter;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Porter;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);Not a bad porter. Nice appearance, average aroma and flavor. This was a very true to style porter, but nothing stood out. Went great with the burger I ordered.
Copper Canyon Penta-Yum Porter;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Porter;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);A very nice porter. There are plans to open a Copper Canyon near my house. I look forward to trying their other offerings.
Copper Canyon Stout;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Stout;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);The aroma is sweet and toasty. A very smooth medium bodied stout. Has the typical coffee and chocolate flavors but these stimulate the palate. The bitter roasted malts give it a nice ending. A nice respectable beer.
Copper Canyon Stout;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Stout;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);A decent stout. Not as opaque as I would like. Really wasn't full-bodied like I would expect. Good roasty flavor.
Copper Canyon Stout;Chandler, Arizona, United States;Stout;Copper Canyon Grill & Brew Pub (AZ);A very representative Oatmeal Stout, smooth and creamy with a great dry roasted malt flavor, big nose that hints of chocolate and coffee. Adequate hops adds to the unique qualities of this beer.
Greyhawk (Copper Dragon);Carbondale, Illinois, United States;Stout;Copper Dragon Brewing Co.;This rich dark Oatmeal Stout proves to be Carbondale’s best. A combination of a mildly fruity taste giving way to a dark rich nutty aftertaste makes this beer great from the time it hits your lips until the time it reaches your belly.
Copper Tank Copper Light;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;I actually had some respect for this beer. For a little it wasn't bad. But that doesn't say much. Light nose, pale gold color, low head. Light lemony ale and low bitter. The balance is on.
Copper Tank Copper Light;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Yep. It's light. On everything. Including flavor. Now I have to come up with 75 characters to fill the review.
Copper Tank Copper Light;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Yes, this is the obligatory lite beer that must be served if you want RateBeerians to think your brewpub is weak. Most brewpubs would serve a Blond Ale instead. Extremely mild.
Copper Tank Copper Light;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;"The mandatory light beer that every brewery must have to keep the chicks coming. Blaugh...a friend of mine put it appropriately when he said, ""Makes Coors Light seem like it actually has taste""."
Copper Tank Big Dog Brown Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Pours reddish-brown with little head. Some maltiness and nuttiness in both aroma and flavor. Very thin, kind of just a light american beer with more color. I didn’t like this one much at all.
Copper Tank Big Dog Brown Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Had on tap at the Copper Tank Brewery in Austin,Tx. Dark ruby red to dark brown appearance. Thin, slightly mocha colored head, slight lacing. Aroma has some nutty notes. Flavor has some strong chocolate notes which are quite nice and surprisingly strong. Some nutty notes come through as well. Finish is a bit weak.
Copper Tank Big Dog Brown Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Poor showing overall. Light nose, auburn color, no head. Cherry fruitiness and a some nutty roasted malt tones. Metallic bitter end. Thin. Haphazard balance.
Copper Tank Big Dog Brown Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Okay, there is some head and a bit of lace. Not strong in the flavor department, but was good.
Copper Tank Big Dog Brown Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Slight notes of bitterness yet a touch watery. Adequate. Oh yes, and a bit nutty.
Copper Tank Big Dog Brown Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Looks kinda like red tea and doesn't taste all that different! Flat. Vague nutty tastes.
Copper Tank Big Dog Brown Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Soap-like tackiness and astringency. Vaguely hoppy finish, but there was nothing to it, especially when set against my pulled pork sandwich on day-old bread (and cold french fries)--in fairness, this was the day after Thanksgiving. (on tap at Austin location)
Copper Tank Big Dog Brown Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;good stuff! Went down smooth, chocolate notes. Like newcastle with a pulse
Copper Tank Big Dog Brown Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;A nice brown...not in the same class with Newcastle...very smooth and very drinkable. Didn't taste any chocolate though.
Copper Tank Big Dog Brown Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Dark brown. Caramelly maltiness, rather sweet, and - yes, a hint of chocolate. Medium bitterness.
Copper Tank River City Raspberry Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;"What the fluck? Why don't you cocksuckers geet a real goddamn beer and quir pussying around with fucking raspberries. One of my fucking rules...no raspberries in my fucking beer. shove thee raspberries up your ass you bunch of cocksuckers. you bunch of shilly shit raspberries eating homos. as;;;;kjkja;liwubzdn"
Copper Tank River City Raspberry Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Light bodied sweetish ale with a too sweet flavour of raspberries. No, this is not my cup of tea.
Copper Tank River City Raspberry Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;tastey as the sence.........................................................
Copper Tank White Tail Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;"Dark copper appearance, decent sized white head with adequate lacing. Slight floral nose; not unpleasant. Grapfefruit citrus flavor is prominent and there is not much of a balancing malt background - more akin to an IPA in my opinion. Mouthfeel has the proper thickness for an APA. Overall, mark this as decent - would drink again."
Copper Tank White Tail Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Copper Tank is the weak step-sister to Austin's Bitter End Brewery. This pale ale is somewhat thin and rather mild. An unchallenging beer with good Cascade usage.
Copper Tank White Tail Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Dark orange with soapy aroma and as-promised soapy flavors. Weak attempt at a pale ale!
Copper Tank White Tail Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Nice head, solid well-rounded beer with bitterness and hop flavors typical of an APA. A nice example of the style, satisfying against the food they serve (BBQ). (on tap at Austin location)
Copper Tank White Tail Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Typical american pale ale. Orange coloured, medium bodied, dry, big flowery hop aroma. I've had at the Dallas location.
Copper Tank White Tail Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;I'd rather have a Sierra Nevada, but this is definitely not a bad pale ale for a buck per 8 ounces! I know, I know, those words are usually an excuse to buy things like Sam Adams, but this is really decent beer, especially for something brewed in Texas.

Mostly wheat, light fruity sweetness, some citrus notes, and an earthy peppery hop presence. Pours cloudy golden orange with a thin head. The flavor starts with wheat and cereal notes then moves in to a light fruity sweetness followed by some quenching crispness and a light earthy peppery bitterness in the finish. Nice quenching brew with lively carbonation. Was looking for a little more yeasty twang and notes akin to a Bavarian Wheat though.

Flavor is subdued for the style, wheat and fruit flavors dissipate quickly leaving a sweet citrus tang in the finish.

Coronado Silver Strand Steam Ale;Coronado, California, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Coronado Brewing Company;I put this side by side with an Anchor and the difference was so wide that I didn't really need to. Fuller in body and flavor, caramel malts and accompanying hop balance put this close to the amber ale style. Still holds that refreshing lager drinkability.

Coronado Four Brothers Pale Ale;Coronado, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coronado Brewing Company;Over tha past few weeks I’ve drawn to 4BPA as a shift drink.

Coronado Reggae Rye;Coronado, California, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Coronado Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub named Nuclear Nimitz. Reddish with a decent enough head after I pour it into another pint glass. Unfortunatly the flavor has a burnt caramel thing going on and not in a good way. Hoppy with some cinnamon.

Coronado Mermaid's Red Ale;Coronado, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Coronado Brewing Company;As soon as I poured this, I felt that it may be a bad bottle. Not much fizz and came out murky and color of the Suwannee River. Still had some carbonation and flavor, which saved this beer...but I could tell something was off. Texture a little heavy and flavor has a slight sour to it. Still decent though of caramel malt...mild bitter hop at the end. Just an average amber. I'd bump up the rating a few points if fresh.

Coronado Tent City Tan;Coronado, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Coronado Brewing Company;(Draft: Coronado Brewing Co. in Coronado, CA) Tent City Tan, which according to the menu used to be called Red Rock Amber, looks pretty ruddy for an amber ale, and it’s a fairly dark amber too. The small, off-white head settles to a perfectly even, filmy layer. The nose just isn’t very aromatic at all, and no particular aromas jump out at me. It just smells a little sweet and caramely, like most brewpub ambers. The flavor is also quite generic: lightly caramely, lightly sweet, somewhat grainy and gently bitter. Just not much going on here. Balanced but boring. Medium-bodied and fairly clean and crisp for an amber. The dense curtain of lace on the glass dissipates at a much slower rate than the head. Yup, another boring, generic brewpub special, not worth drinking the rest of the pint.
Coronado Tent City Tan;Coronado, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Coronado Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours dark amber in color with a thick off-white head. Has a bit of a citrus aroma. Perhaps a bit of coriander? Good bitterness and GREAT lacing. Spots form atop the head. Finishes with a low-tartness lingering bitter bite. Nice.
Coronado New Scots Ale;Coronado, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Coronado Brewing Company;Backlog, from notes. On tap @ the brewpub, 10 May 2001. Red-brown color. Aroma’s: malts, some fruit, a little dusty (cork?). Flavor is lightly sweet, fruity. The cork flavor was a bit off, but solid otherwise.
Coronado New Scots Ale;Coronado, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Coronado Brewing Company;"Now called ""Hop Scotch Ale"" at the brewery. Pours dark copper with no head. Aroma is caramel and some malt. Good peatiness up front that bleeds into caramel and sweeter malts. Wanted more, but still a pretty good beer."
Coronado New Scots Ale;Coronado, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Coronado Brewing Company;Called Sotally Tober on draft at brewery in Coronado, CA: Dark ebony color, nose of sweet caramel, just caramel, oh, and a bit of earthy peat. The flavor is chewy and light in intensity. A bit of malt but underhopped. Decent tail and finish.
Coronado New Scots Ale;Coronado, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Coronado Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub: Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head. Lacing is quite good. Aroma is oak and whisky. Sweet malt and biterness also around. Flavor is sweet and malty with the whisky notes appearing as well. Actually pretty complex. Body is medium to full. Nice bitterness on the swallow. This is good.
Coronado New Scots Ale;Coronado, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Coronado Brewing Company;Deep brown color with a tan head. Nutty nose and taste. Not quite what I’d expect in a Scotch Ale, but still very enjoyable.
Coronado New Scots Ale;Coronado, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Coronado Brewing Company;"(Draft: Coronado Brewing Co. in San Diego, CA) At first, this has a moderate dark roasted malty flavor with a moderately bitter hoppiness for nice balance; But once again, like the Bay Bridge Bock, this Coronado beer is quite sugary and sweet -- too sweet in fact -- and it becomes a tad cloying after a few sips, masking the true character of the moderate dark roasted malt and hops; There's a slight alcohol flavor, but it's kept at bay; Medium to full bodied that coats the palate with a sticky sweetness after awhile; Lightly sweet and malty nose, but it's hard to tell since I'm sitting right next to a double station coffee machine; Ruddy mahogany color; Tannish head fades to nothing fairly quickly, so there's obviously no lacing; If it were less sweet, this would be a pretty solid Scottish Ale, but the excessive sweetness really is a pretty strong negative"
Coronado New Scots Ale;Coronado, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Coronado Brewing Company;draught: I assume that this is what I had, It was labeled as scotch ale... Brown as dirt with a khaki head, Whiskey or scotch aroma or cognac or something (don't ask me which, cuz i couldn't tell you) Very rich and malty, bitter finish, an interesting brew
Florida Brewing Dunks;Auburndale, Florida, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Florida Brewery, Inc (Empresas Polar);"I first experienced this beer in 1961, when it sold for .69 a six-pack. For reference Shlitz and Budweiser sold for $1.29, Busch (then called ""Busch Bavarian"") and Old Milwaukee were $1.09. I have no idea why this beer was (and still apparently is) brewed in Auburndale, FL - but the worst beer in America being brewed in area once exclusively associated with processing phosphorous makes some sort of sense."

Unibroue Eau Bénite;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Tripel;Unibroue (Sapporo);Bottle, sampled in a large tulip glass, this ale had a orange-gold pour with hints of yellow at the sides of the glass, the pour started out clear and got hazy as the bottle emptied, the pour gave an initial two to three finger white head that receded to a thin cover and sticky ring, the glass had a center stream of bubbles of medium flow or a little less, there was a layer of medium to dark brown colored on the bottom of the bottle, the nose had yeast and fresh bread aromas, pear and apple fruit, some alcohol esters, malt and fruit sweetness, a little dough in the background, it had flavors of apple and pear, light malt and bread, and fruit sweetness, a little pepper at the finish but not much in dryness or citrus, the mouth feel was light to almost medium with a little creamy feel on the palate, I thought the carbonation was a little light, it could have used more carbonation, not a stand out in the world of tripel beers, the Unibroue La Fin du Monde was a much better example of a tripel, an ok drink.

Big scents of raisins cinnamon, sherry and alcohol. Lots of carbonation with a sour acidic dry mouthfeel. Tastes of golden raisins, cinnamon and yeast that seem to fight somewhat.

Unibroue U Blonde;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Unibroue (Sapporo);I live in Ontario and when I was in Quebec purchased Unibroue U Blonde and really like this beer. This beer is a very nice tasting beer and is not to Heavy.I would love to promote this beer in Ontario and have this here in Ontario.A very nice tasting beer that I really enjoy.
Unibroue U Blonde;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Unibroue (Sapporo);Pours a foamy eggshell white head and has a dull pale golden appearance. Fairly weak lacing.

Just a tad nutty with some honey in the finish. Faint carbonation. Slick mouthfeel. A bit watery with a drying sensation. A good Unibroue mass produced type beer.
Unibroue Sans Nom;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Unibroue (Sapporo);330. Thanks, Dany! Pours an opaque but bright strawberry blonde...until, well, this is probably a good time to remind everyone that I am a bit of an idiot. I just poured a 10-year-old BSA of unknown provenance straight down into a glass, just turned it over and glugged it. When the yeast cake burst through the mouth, it looked like I was firing a potato gun into a Duvel tulip. A potato gun that fires sweet, spicy, gooey potatoes of Quebecois love. I’ll let you just not think too much about some of the creepy gay overtones of what we just talked about, and move us right along to the beer. There’s not much head, even after I just poured the thing like a waiter at Applebee’s. Turns a tawny-looking caramel color if you’re stupid and careless enough to turn the yeast cake loose. Big caramel, toffee, and fig nose. Spicy sweet and delicious. Creamy medium body, surprisingly unsticky for all the sugars aboard. Very little carb. Caramel, toffee, figs, dates, and cookie dough on the mid palate. A wonderful combination of sweet and interesting notes that complement each other very well. Caramel sticky finish. Great beer, especially considering. Thanks so much, D.
Unibroue Sans Nom;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Unibroue (Sapporo);Bottle [341ml] shared with HogTownHarry, GregClow & garthicus -- c/o HogTownHarry. 2000 vintage! 10 years old eh? Let’s do it! Pours a hazy golden-orange with a spare white head. Aroma: Not bad at all, it kind of reminds me of a UK Barley Wine. Quite fruity along with caramel malt, yeast and some maple syrup. Flavour is spicy in the finish, I didn’t expect that, dry, yeasty and fruity tasting -- much of the flavour is in the finish. Syrupy mouthfeel. Average bodied. This held up for a decade very well!
Unibroue Sans Nom;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Unibroue (Sapporo);In short: A very old but surprisingly drinkable dusty, yeasty, rustic, tangy Belgian blonde ale. How: Bottle 341ml. Vintage 2000 (!!!). Consumed when too many years old. Bottle from Brasseurs Illimités personnal cellar, thanks René The look: Partly cloudy golden orange body topped by a small white head In long: Nose of burnt oranges, yeast spiciness, caramel, dust. Taste is has some kind of woody caramel upfront, dusty yeast. I know I haven’t had this beer since I started on ratebeer in 2005. And I don’t remember if I’ve had this local beer before. Maybe… 9 years ago? I don’t know (or remember) what it is supposed to taste like when fresh. But the bottle I drank had developed a rustic character with dusty and rusty notes. Unibroue sold it under the name “Without Name”, but that’s only because its real name was Renaldo.
Unibroue Sans Nom;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Unibroue (Sapporo);"341ml bottle - shared with blankboy, garthicus and gregclow, via trade with JulienHuxley. Sure, it’s old - but I’ve wanted to try these long-retired Unibroues for years. D’oh - forgot to record the date!! Pours a flat-looking mostly clear gold, a touch oily-looking, with a small white head. Smells - actually, it doesn’t smell bad - peach, yeast, alcohol, a hint of paper - oxidized some, but not bad. Taste ... reminds me of Unibroue 10 - follows the nose right on with fruitiness, some alcohol, a bit dry and yeasty, overall sweet and a tad musty. Average body, mild carbonation, slick and again a bit must on the tongue, a hint of sourness in the finish - it’s held up some, thinning out, but ""not poison"""
Unibroue Sans Nom;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Unibroue (Sapporo);Thanks to HogTownHarry. Appearance: Cloudy yellow with a small but persistent white head. Aroma: lots of caramel, maple, somewhat dusty, a little barleywine-esq with fruit in there too. Flavour: quite a lot of honey, malt, carbonated but not fizzy, tingling, a little spicy in the finish. Nice.
Unibroue Sans Nom;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Unibroue (Sapporo);Bottle- Thanks so much Steve! Decants into my Unibroue snifter, a hazed burnt orange, with a thin white head that dissipates to a small ring. Interesting nose of wet basement, spices, oranges, brown sugar, and almost funky yeast. Tastes sweet, also slightly tart. Candied apricots, spice, and funky yeast leads to brown sugar. Thin, light medium body with an earthy finish. Still pretty good considering the age, and past its prime, but it is still drinking ok IMO. Glad I got to try it!
Unibroue Sans Nom;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Unibroue (Sapporo);Bottle, vintage 2000. Thanks RH. Aroma is light brandy and cherries. Taste is cherries again, quite maderised. Light effervescence and thin palate. Not that bad despite his age.
Unibroue Sans Nom;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Unibroue (Sapporo);Golden-orange in colour with a lasting but thin white coloured head, some light lacing and lots of visible carbonation. The aroma has some sugary sweetness still, some spice but the gingerbread is starting to take over. The flavour is also starting to go but there is still enough there for this to be enjoyable, the sweetness is light, ginger and some oxidization is starting to set in. Thin mouthfeel, meidum/light body, mild carbonation. Finishes lingering with a bit of spice. Well, it only took me 7 years to find this. Obviously nowhere near what this used to taste like, I give credit to the brewers because Unibroue beers have a crazy nack of holding up for years. Pretty much done now, drinking this is just for fun from here on out. Maybe one day I’ll come across another bottle. 341ml bottle obtained in a trade with Goldorak, thanks Martin. Opened on March 29, 2008. Vintage 2000.
Unibroue Sans Nom;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Unibroue (Sapporo);Thanks to Jeff for sharing. The first beer of Saturday. Slightly hazy gold, thin head.

Murky tarnished copper with a miniscule head...light caramel and smoke in the nose...pleasant, clean woody notes in the body, caramel and a bit of tar and licorice...medium carbonation, could be fuller at the finish.
Grays Autumn Ale-Nut Brown Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Grays Brewing Company;This beer was nothing special as far as the style. Solid, not impressive. A little thin and yeasty for a brown. Color and balance were well done, but the yeast came through and the mouthfeel was thin. Reading the other reviews, maybe I had a bottle that went a little awry, but maybe not. Same bitterness as described elsewhere.
Grays Autumn Ale-Nut Brown Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Grays Brewing Company;A deep brownish red beer with a coppery-tinged head (thin and fleeting). Strong scone or honey and biscuit aroma. Warm nuts and honey or honey and nuts. A fine brown ale, a bit on the thin side for body, but has a long, enduring finish. Very little up front though. Sweet for the style, but not bad overall.
Grays Autumn Ale-Nut Brown Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Grays Brewing Company;"RERATE 10/8/04: After sampling three more bottles of this, I have to revise my rating upwards a little. I think the original bottle I tried was a litlle ""funky"". None of the three bottles I sampled later had the metallic taste I detected in the first one, and the ""nuttiness"" was more pronounced. Flavor was far superior so I've adjusted the rating accordingly. ORIGINAL RATING: I wanted to like this beer more. I really did. But let’s take it as it comes...From a bottle, this brew poured a dark brown with reddish tinges at the edge of the glass. Nice initial tan head that disappears quickly. Slight metallic hint in the aroma. Taste is mildly chocolate-y & somewhat nutty. Very slight metallic taste in the background. Reasonable hop presence towards the end. It certainly isn’t a bad brew for the money but it didn’t exactly wow me."

Aroma of roasted grains and nuts. A faint solvent aroma distracts slightly. Quite thin in body. Flavors of hickory nuts and a mild hop bitterness. Finishes with a touch of astringency. Borders on a brown porter in flavor, but lacks body. A good beer none the less. 10/9/03: I pick this up every year. This may be the only brown ale I would buy on a regular(annual) basis. touch more body this year and a hint of chocolate. Still solid.
Grays Autumn Ale-Nut Brown Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Grays Brewing Company;"Mmmm...smells nutty! Smooth, nice flavor. Damn, this stuff goes down easy! Add a 6 pack of this and ""Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back"" DVD, and you have a decent pre-bar evening!"

Grays Black and Tan;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Grays Brewing Company;"3/26/2007: Gray’s Black & Tan Ale is neither black nor tan, but more of an amber color with a small, fizzy, beige crown. (I know that the term ""black and tan"" doesn’t pertain to the color, but I couldn’t resist the urge to start my comments with that corny attempt at a joke...) The visible carbonation is moderate. Caramel and some light nuttiness are in the aroma. The flavor is similar with light hops and stale chocolate. There is a nice bitter bite and some roasted maltiness in the DRY, soapy finish. The body is seems a bir watered down feeling and there is some occasional fizziness as well. It seems like this bottle might be slightly old and/or oxidized. Not the best black and tan I’ve had... 12 oz bottle (34504GBC 0938 CT.05) from buckybeer (Dec 2006). Thanks for the bonus Mark! I appreciate it."

Grays Black and Tan;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Grays Brewing Company;Without a doubt the best black and tan in a bottle...anywhere. Rich roasted , nutty malt predominates, the stout half being by far the most dominant flavor. But the EPA is represented by a lighter floral hopping that plays well against the heavier, more imposing stout. A little thin bodied, but not to the point of imposing demerits. All in all, very nicely done!

The aroma has notes of caramel and toasted malts, aromatic and grassy hops, coffee, and soem berry esters. The taste starts bland with just your basic malt sweetness before a dose of coffe and hop bitterness shows. Remains the same throughout the glass. The feel is watery and fizzy. An average to below average porter, not much going on here. Maybe too old?

Aromas of sweet grains and light brown sugar. Very grainy in flavor. Much like chewing on the grain/malt itself. Very dry finish with little linger.

Grays Honey Ale;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grays Brewing Company;I remember when this first came out and won a Gold along with their Oatmeal Stout in GABF in Denver at the same time. I rated this and the review got lost. Anyway, this beer is nothing like what it used to be, which was clean, crisp, subtle and a true pleasure. Now, it’s soft, thin, overstated and totally forgettable. A pity.

Smell is simply crisp and clean. Woo, there is a goodly amount of co2 in there on the tongue, fer sure. Taste is a little like slag. A fairly easy to get along with beer, not over the top in sweetness, never cloying. No real bitter attributes make this easy to drink. Finish has no ill effects that I can speak of. Overall just a decent beer that provides a good beer drinken experience. Would not hesitate to buy again, better than any of the cheaper pale lagers I drink.

Aromas of dark chocolate dominate, with some coffee, oatmeal, and damp earth in the background. On the palate, it’s fairly light and easy, with oatmeal and chocolate flavors being tempered by a gentle, but noticeable sourdough-like tartness.

Gritty McDuffs Black Fly Stout;Portland, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Gritty McDuffs;When I first starting drinking this sample, thought the final rating would be lower than what I'm giving....but in the end it all adds up to one solid beer. There are definitely other sweet/dry stouts that I would prefer, but still mostly better than expected. Grew on me towards the end of the glass. Appearance really can't get any better. Super dark black with mocha head.....looks thick but feel is rather thin. Was thinking and hoping would have more chocolate to the flavor, which seems to water it down a bit....but on the other hand gives it s thinner/more easy to drink lighter mouthfeel. Flavor almost an 8....has slight potential to be more. Either way I give props to my first sample from Gritty.

Nose is very malty, sweet but not overdone, with wet grain and faint smoke, candyish elements and artificial sweetener, light citrus. Pours deep amber with a soapy tan head.

A bit grainy (as in husky), touch of toasting to the malt, earthy hops with a bit of wood. Dries out slightly, light body is pretty soft and actually somewhat interesting, but there are brewing flaws all over this and it’s pretty dirty on the whole.

Gritty McDuffs Maine's Best IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;Gritty McDuffs;"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle. Nice, clear light brown appearance, but the head dissipated quickly (and virtually no lacing is there). The nose was evident with malty bread and caramel notes. It has a bitter bite that matches the 60 IBUs, but the English and German malts dominate. Seems to be an ""Extra Special Bitter Ale"" and not an IPA at all. Cheers!"

There was also a dash of salt. I tasted white paper, Ritz crackers, leather, and some milk chocolate. Carbonation was on the higher end of the spectrum.

The flavors were as subtle as the aromas. I tasted a bit of adhesive tape and some thin papery malt, but that was it. Non-offensive to those who don’t care about beer, but a bit offensive to me. Eh.
Harbor City Main Street Brown Ale;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;I poured half the bottle and watched the head consume the top half of my glass. Once settled, the flavor was similar to other brown ales, like Newcastle.
Harbor City Main Street Brown Ale;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;12oz bottle(5/01)-A dark ruby red body with w medium white head which dissipated rather quickly. Aroma of roasted malts and slight caramel. Taste of the same with some faint hops coming out. Not bad.
Harbor City Main Street Brown Ale;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;Picked up a single 12-oz bottle at Flanagan’s in Appleton, Wisconsin. Pours a clear reddish amber brew with a creamy thin white head that dissolves to a fine film and ring. Spotty lacing. Aroma of multi-grain malt, some flowery hops, roasted nuts and some caramel. Taste is lightly carbonated, medium bodied with flavors of roasted nuts, caramel malt and some citrus. Finish is slightly watery and dry with a sweet caramel aftertaste.
Harbor City Main Street Brown Ale;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;Seems many brown ales are criticized for being boring. This one is no exception. Brown, see-through color. Short, foamy head. Malty, sweet aroma with notes of caramel and some grain. Flavor starts sweet and stays sweet, though there is a slight tartness at the end. Lively carbonation for a clean finish.
Harbor City Main Street Brown Ale;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;Bottled. Poured clear iced tea brown with a short beige head. Aroma was airy and weak with mild chocolate notes and some grass.. other sweet malty notes, but nothing really did it for me. Flavor had semi-sweet chocolate and cola sweetness with mild grassy bitterness.. dry cola finish. Light-bodied and watery on the palate.. never felt good. Meh.
Harbor City Transcendental Wheat;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;Old notes. You really did need to be transcendental to get any of the matter in this one. Amber color with a somewhat fizzy head. Aromas of stomach acid, citrus, grass and old yeast. Flavors meld with the aromas, bringing together a matter that the mind and palate could not overcome. Acidic and sour, citric and oddly spiced. There was nothing refreshing about his one. Drain pour the last half of the bomber.
Huntington Beach Abbots Belgian Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Huntington Beach Beer Company;Good, nice nose, great malt and hop balance. Found it a bit subdued, but quite good.

Huntington Beach Brickshot Red;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Huntington Beach Beer Company;Tap at the brewpub. Pours dark amber with orange glints and a beige head. Aroma is pretty malty, but there’s a good deal of hop. There’s a chocolate aspect, but there’s enough old school hop to render it enjoyable. Malty, hoppy and bitter. Works nicely together.
Huntington Beach Brickshot Red;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Huntington Beach Beer Company;Draft. Subdued nose and carbonation. Medium red color. Rich malty flavor. Slightly bitter finish. Very smooth and drinkable, and goes well with food.
Huntington Beach Brickshot Red;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Huntington Beach Beer Company;14th July 2014: large sample from the tap at the brewpub. I did not want any more. Looking at others thoughts on this site it would seem my offering was old or infected, needing taking off the bar because it was almost sour. Malty and red coloured yes, but not sweet or interesting, just ’iffy’ in everything. Only just managed to finish my sample it was that bad.
Huntington Beach Brickshot Red;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Huntington Beach Beer Company;Pours a clear amber red with nice head. Aroma is roasted malt with some hop bitterness on the back end of the sip. Medium mouth feel.

Huntington Beach Brickshot Red;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Huntington Beach Beer Company;"Draught at the restaurant. Probably the better of the ales we tasted today.

Huntington Beach California Lager;Huntington Beach, California, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Huntington Beach Beer Company;Clean and very thirst queching with a decent nose and a nice bite, I liked it and I'm not normally into lagers.
Huntington Beach Main Street Wheat;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Huntington Beach Beer Company;Draught sample at the restaurant. From what I recall it was rather heavy on the banana and the malt. Rather cloudy pour too. Not bad just a little distance from being light and refreshing.
Huntington Beach Main Street Wheat;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Huntington Beach Beer Company;A little cloudy and yellow, with small head. Bready, citrus, a touch of banana. Rich and flavorful. I could drink another, but the 15th anniv. is on tap now also so that’s my next pint!!
Huntington Beach Main Street Wheat;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Huntington Beach Beer Company;I found it a bit weak?, not bad but a little off maybe. Malty and a little bit of bite, very disappointed.
Huntington Beach Pier Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Huntington Beach Beer Company;Shaker pint draft at Huntington Beer Company in Huntington Beach, California. The pour is a slight haze orange golden with a thin off white head. The aroma is soft floral with cereal malt.

Huntington Beach Pier Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Huntington Beach Beer Company;Draft. Average nose and carbonation. Relatively weak flavor for an IPA. Clean finish. There are much better choices for an IPA.
Huntington Beach Pier Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Huntington Beach Beer Company;Draft at the Brewpub The APA poured a light amber with a small off white head. There was modest lacing. The aroma was lightly floral. The ale had a medium body and soft carbonation. This is great beer to watch the sun set on Walnut and Main. We were able to see the Huntington Beach pier from our seats in the outside section. In the back, hop bitterness takes hold, inducing a lasting swallow.
Huntington Beach Pier Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Huntington Beach Beer Company;A: The pour is a golden amber color with a thin white head topping it off. S: The hops are there, but like most of the other beers here, they’re grassy and rather unappealing. A bit of a citrus peel aroma does provide a bit of redemption. Unfortunately, there’s a weird, sweet fruitiness of grapes and some corn. T: Definitely a corn flavor to this, which really doesn’t belong in a pale ale. Bitter hops with more grass and a touch of pine. Some light breadiness and faint citrus peel flavors. M: Medium in body with a moderate carbonation. O: You’re not doing well if you can’t pull off a basic pale ale. And this one wasn’t executed well at all.
Huntington Beach Pier Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Huntington Beach Beer Company;This was a lighter version of the Indicator IPA. Pour is a light orange gold with a white head. Aroma is mostly flower hops with some malt character. Flavor is barely bitter. Finishes smooth.
Huntington Beach Pier Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Huntington Beach Beer Company;"Fresh batch put on tap today. Brewer Greg says around 5%; not dry hopped. Centennial, Cascade, and Williamette hops. Gold color, significant white head of mixed size bubbles.

Huntington Beach Pier Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Huntington Beach Beer Company;22oz bottle poured a hazed amber color. The aroma had a bad Belgian yeast character that was definitely infected. Taste was the same with a very bad infection going on. Would have to try this again if it’s clean.
Huntington Beach Pier Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Huntington Beach Beer Company;Clear, light golden amber appearance, minimal foam. Lightly fragrant aroma. Palate is hoppy and biscuity, with slight tropical fruit tones in the middle and a mild bitterness in the finish.
Huntington Beach Pumpkin Head Ale 1;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Huntington Beach Beer Company;Ale 1 or Ale 2...not sure which but since no ratings on either, I’ll use Ale 1 and I assume they are the same beer, perhaps different batches. I’m not a fan of pumpkin beers but this one does a good job of balancing the pumpkin flavors and making it drinkable. Pour is a dark gold orange with an off white head. Flavor and aroma are all that you’d find in a pumpkin pie but they aren’t very strong, which is nice because if its strong, it doesn’t settle right for me.

Karl Strauss Berliner Weiss;San Diego, California, United States;Berliner Weisse;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;On tap at KS in La Jolla. Looks exactly like grapefruit juice even with the pulp. Slight grapefruit smell, seems like it can’t decide if it wants to be a sour, or something sweet (might be due to the raspberry artificial sweetener). Maybe the problem was that I was not given the choice to have the sweetener or keep it out since the server said it was part of the brew but honestly this was terrible. Avoid the sweetened version at all costs.

Karl Strauss La Jolla Hefeweiss;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Tried at Disney’s California Adventureland, served in a transparent, flimsy YELLOW plastic tumbler. Wonder what the REAL colour of this might be? And, the server tossed in a slice of lime before I could stop her. However, this wasn’t half bad. Smallish white head, aroma of (mostly) the lime, but taste and mouthfeel were not objectionable. Next time, no lime and a proper glass, please.
Karl Strauss La Jolla Hefeweiss;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Soapy, clouded, hazy wit-like body with a small bubbly white head. Clove-banana nose and strong coriander/orange peel flavor. Very assertive and fragrant. Nice!

Karl Strauss Hortons Hootch;San Diego, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Tap - Karl Strauss has made a nice golden beer with a smooth, malty taste.

Karl Strauss Hortons Hootch;San Diego, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Best thing about this one is that it's high in alcohol. Good malty body for a copper beer. And I mean new copper like you see at Home Depot before the plumber gets his doped up hands all over it. Great yeast this brewery has, adds a griany/butterscotchy flavor that I love.

Karl Strauss Oktoberfest Beer;San Diego, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;12oz bottle into a glass tankard at my daughters place in Orange County, California on 8th Dec 2017. Almost clear, deep amber body, the full white crown, sadly left the scene very quickly to leave a headless body. Malty front with a semi-sweetness throughout. A slight hop bitterness tries to balance out the malty molasses but they do not quite make it. My sweet tooth liked it very much, pity about the head!
Karl Strauss Oktoberfest Beer;San Diego, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Taster Brewpub. Sorry, didn't rate this at all. Soft appearance, soft aroma, soft taste. Just all round soft and lacking in anything distinguishing. Nope.

Aroma is a light sweet but toasted malt. Flavor is the same. A slight sweet malt with a little toasted bready malt. This beer has a horrible rating on here but other than being a bit light all around I could not find any fault with this.

The aroma has solid toasted malt and hints of earthy, woody hops. Bready and toasted. The flavor is the same. Bready, toasted with hints of cooked squash.

Not terribly pleasant.
Karl Strauss Oatmeal Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Beer #2 in a flight. Dark poor, but rather thin still. Some toasted malt in the flavor, and smooth.

Opaque deep brown/black with nitro C02 mix allowed to settle into a rather attractive creamy head. Choc/Cocoa and sweet malt aromas on the nose. Roasty flavours then added on the palate post tasting.

Karl Strauss Oatmeal Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;On tap at the Brewery Gardens in Sorrento Mesa. Black as can be with a dense nitro head. This honestly tasted more like an oatmeal porter than an oatmeal stout. The body was much too thin for a stout, but this was still a really good beer. Of course I might be biased as porter is one of my favorite styles. Good roasty notes and flavor overall.

Ochakovo Premium Svetloe;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ochakovo;Bottle, at Christina and Camillo’s house-- Happy 72nd birthday Camillo! This was standard lager appearance, not much to describe there. The palate was clean, and I like that I found no stinky adjuncts here. I also like that the pale malts were not overly sweet. The hops could have been a little more prevalent, but coming from Russia, I’m pretty sure freshness was not helping the hop situation. Overall I preferred this lager over anything brewed in our macro market in Canada by a longshot.

EuroBrand;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);As common as the Euro and as aesthetically attractive. I remember the Guilder used to be such a colourful and cheerful style of currency. This one is now a dour uninspring and totally fake replica of whatever a beer is, just like the euro. Good thing that it cost something close to that denomination as it isn’t worth any more than that.
EuroBrand;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);I can't believe this has so few ratings, it seems like you can get it anywhere around here. A decent lager, smooth and the taste wasn't so bad.
EuroBrand;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);First off - cheap - generic looking TV studio label - were there no artists available in Holland? Were they on strike? Anyway - back to the beer. Bit of a wort-like aroma to it that I have witnessed in other beers such as Bavaria's NA. Medium golden appearance with little to no head. Malty flavor with a bit of a biscuity taste to it. The malty twang is what makes this beer stand above some of the other boring Euro lagers. Not bad.
EuroBrand;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Malty brew, lightly sweet like graham crackers. Reminded me some of a Carribean or Eastern European lager. Terrible appearance marks for the green bottle, and the name, which is like some bad translation. The beer itself is unremarkable medium gold. A little tinny in the finish. I was in dire fear of something with such a generic name, but it actually turned out decently.
EuroBrand;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);An interesting Heineken taste-alike. Decent and non-skunked, thankfully! Crisp with a flavor remarkably reminiscent of..........Heineken.

Polander Beer;Koszalin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);I have a friend that goes to visit his mother who lives in Perth Amboy, NJ and he brings me all these weird foriegn beers. Thin white head and it was a light gold. I don’t know. I have had this beer a million times before it was just in various bottles. It tasted exactly like any other beer of its style from central or eastern Europe. Nothing new and exciting here. There’s no reason for me to really tell you what it’s like. Tastes like every other Polish or Russian beer. It’s not good and it’s not bad. It’ll work.
Polander Beer;Koszalin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);Thin head which does not last long. Color is a medium gold and is slightly hazy. Aroma of hops and malt but nothing fancy. Taste is a little bland but not offensive with more malts. Finish is a little dry and bitter from the hops. You could do much worse than this.
Polander Beer;Koszalin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);Smells of stale beer, corn syrup and pickles. Color is yellow with a slight haze. Taste is like a regular mass produced american beer, but not at all watery.
Polander Beer;Koszalin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);Crisp is right-o on this one, but I'm glad...at least it's not sickly sweet or with obvious adjuncts. A fair lager. Nice little nose to it.

Polander Beer;Koszalin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);I'm not really into this beer, even if it's from Poland. Sort of pale and unassuming. It's probably better to drink in the summer, as it's crisp and very light bodied.
Polander Beer;Koszalin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);Hmm, new beer from Poland (that first time in few months). Very weak head, pale lager. Aromas were not too special, some malt. Reminds me of those South American beers that I had few days ago, slightly more creamy.
Polander Beer;Koszalin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);"Hazy light gold; grainy, sour apple, raspberry on the nose; palate is light, maybe 25 IBUs, slightly herbal with a hint of grass."

Lightly increasing dryness from lingering hop/roast bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 6%. Overall this is a delicious American brown ale. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, light-moderate earthy hops, and light fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Not overly roasty. Nicely rich and well rounded malt complexity; nice earthy hop balance, and mild fruity yeast presence. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example. Glad I was able to try it from the anniversary pack."

Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, cherries, candi sugar, pale malt, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness and tart/tangy fruit balance; with no cloying/puckering flavors after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from spiciness and tart/tangy fruit. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy, acidic/tangy fruit, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Mildly increasing warmth of 9.8% after the finish. Overall this is an awesome fruited Belgian strong pale ale. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, cherries, candi sugar, pale malt, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip with the mellowly spicy/acidic/tangy/drying finish. Very juicy/jammy cherries and balanced Belgian yeast complexity; with a great candi sugar/pils malt backbone. Well attenuated, not overly sweet/heavy for the ABV from lingering dryness. A really enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."

Clear red-ish pour, showing off the cherry. light bubbly head.mild cherry whet aroma. Big tart cherry taste. Not necessarily great, but big. I'm not a fan of this one.

New Holland Zoomer Wit;Holland, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 5/15/2017. Pours fairly hazy medium golden yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts.

New Holland Zoomer Wit;Holland, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;Straw yellow with a stark white pillowy head. Mild wheat aroma. Flavor is more bold than expected. Reminds me of a New Belgium Fat Tire, actually. It's not offensive in any way, but on the flip side not memorable either.
New Holland Zoomer Wit;Holland, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;On tap at New Holland on our way to RBSG. Pours a milky yellow with a thin white head. Grainy, light yeast. Medium bodied, faint wheat. More grain than wheat. Looked promising, fell short.
New Holland Zoomer Wit;Holland, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;Hazey golden color w/ a slight head. This beer had a stale scent which put me on guard prior to tasting. The slice of lemon (in the beer) helped masquerade the bad taste. I drank it at the brewery from the tap.
New Holland Zoomer Wit;Holland, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;Not so great. Yellow but relatively clear and not that hazy. Somewhat limp palate. Some interesting flavors, banana and bubblegum, but not enough texture to satisfy. Bottle.
New Holland Zoomer Wit;Holland, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;Poured to a hazy light yellow with little head or lacing. Aroma was faintly spices and wheat, but I had to work hard to get that. Mouthfeel was a little on the thin side, though I did notice a slight tingle. Taste was more of the muted spice of the nose, and the finish was short and non-descript. Not much to this one
New Holland Zoomer Wit;Holland, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;12-25-08. 12 oz bottle. Poured hazy straw yellow with a frothy head. Smelled of wheat and some spice. Tasted of slightly stale wheat, clove, coriander, and stagnant water. Mild spice and yeast flavor. Needs more citrus flavor to mask the bad water flavor.
New Holland Zoomer Wit;Holland, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;Definitely not a witbier, but a pretty easy drinking wheat ale. Flavor is all wheat, with only a hint of anything else. Not really any spice at all. Lightly sweet taste of wheat.. Light bodied and on the watery side. Very boring beer, but refreshing. Subtle aroma of wheat.
New Holland Zoomer Wit;Holland, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;Hazy straw color w/ an average sized white head and some lacing. Smells of good spice, also hoppy with a little bit of wheat and yeast. Palate is citrus, a good amount of carbonation and an ok mouth feel. Flavor is wheaty with a hint of spice and yeast and a touch of lemon rind. I got one of the last 6 packs at the Blue Goat. I had it with a great big Salmon filet with dill and lemon…a perfect match.
New Holland Zoomer Wit;Holland, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;New Holland Brewing Company;Hazy, orangish-yellow pour. Nose is wheaty, citrusy. Flavor is a bit off, really fakely sweet and citrus. I wouldn’t really call this a wit. I wouldnt have this again.
New Holland Ichabod;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;New Holland Brewing Company;Spice and nutty aroma. Brown and amber in color. Kind of dirty looking. Taste is nutty, nutmeg, bland spice, not really any pumpkin to it. Maybe pumpkin seeds? Not a fan.
New Holland Ichabod;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;New Holland Brewing Company;Orangish brown pour with white head. Aroma of solid pumpkin spice - nutmeg, cinnamon. Tastes of metallic tinny malt and pumpkin spice. Not very good.
New Holland Ichabod;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;New Holland Brewing Company;It's actually a pretty enjoyable pumpkin beer all thing considered. It is perhaps a little overwhelming on a cinnamon/nutmeg type spice and not as much on the pumpkin.
New Holland Ichabod;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;New Holland Brewing Company;It is what you expect when it comes to the pumpkin spice world. Malty aroma with the pumpkin spice coming through. Nice orange color with a small amount of white foam and a little lacing. Refreshing spicy flavor with a strong pumpkin spice aftertaste.
New Holland Ichabod;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;New Holland Brewing Company;One of the worst pumpkins I've tried in awhile! Pours Orange with a thin tan head and decent lacing. The aroma softly filled of fall spices. The taste is quite dry without many of the described flavors coming forward. It almost feels like a pale ale. There's a hint of cinnamon in nutmeg somewhere in the middle but the abrupt dry nearly rye like finish is rather off putting! Not recommended!
New Holland Ichabod;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;New Holland Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Aroma is packed with pumpkin spice--nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, vanilla, raisin. Pours hazy orange with a one finger bone white head with decent retention. Taste is sweet and roasty, some light acidity. Not bad for style.
New Holland Ichabod;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;New Holland Brewing Company;Pours a dark Golden with a thin white head. Tastes of pumpkin and nutmeg. A little bit hoppier than the typical pumpkin ale. This is basically a textbook pumpkin ale, maybe a little more refreshing though.
New Holland Ichabod;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;New Holland Brewing Company;Tap, ADT. Clear golden orange with a small white head. Pumpkin pie spice, white pepper, grassy hops, bread. Light bodied, mild malt finish. OK.
New Holland Ichabod;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;New Holland Brewing Company;Good taste up front but an earthy aftertaste I'm not a fan of. Great aroma. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
New Holland Ichabod;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;New Holland Brewing Company;Very noticeable pumpkin and cinnamon aroma, refreshing and sweet, tad of spice at the end. Good autumn beer! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Brauerei Aying;500 ml bottle. Clear brown reddish, foamy head. Roasted malt, nuts, lemon, a bit metal. Malty sweetness, dry metallic bitterness. Medium bodied, oily watery texture, soft carbonated, dry metallic finish. Rather average.
Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Brauerei Aying;500ml bottle brewed at 5% in Germany. Dark amber to nut-brown in colour. Medium, short-lasting head. Faint roasted, burnt sugar aroma. Moderate carbonation. Toffee malt, roast malt (with associated bitterness), bready malt, all make themselves known in a balanced way. This is a malt-lover's delight, and eminently sessionable for such. The hops are doing work keeping it relatively light and airy in the background, but can't really be picked out beyond perhaps a slight grassiness. The overall impression is a bit like a dark mild/best bitter fused with a lager, and although it's noticeably got its lager heritage, none of the pitfalls of the style remain. I've yet to have an Ayinger beer I didn't enjoy, and this is no exception.
Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Brauerei Aying;Feinporige, langanhaltende, große Schaumkrone eines dunkelbraunen, fast schwarzen Dunkelbiers mit Rotschimmer. Süßlich-malzig im Geruch. Vollmundiger Antrunk mit Bitterschokoladennoten, Körper mit röstmalzigem, minimal herben Noten. Langer, süß-malziger aber etwas wässriger Nachhall, der leicht an ein Stout erinnert. Schnell wieder vergessen.

Old Saddleback Half Stock Ale;Pittsfield, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Old Saddleback Brewing Co.;This beer is gross could not finish it. I can’t under stand why it had such high ratings.
Old Saddleback Half Stock Ale;Pittsfield, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Old Saddleback Brewing Co.;Didn't know they had closed, and don't know how long my bottle was sitting at Table and Vine in Northampton, but there sure was a damn big beige head on the pour, eventually revealing a clear copper body. Aroma is fairly sweet, berry, spicy, roasty/burnt. Taste is medium sweet, caramel, berry, spicy, light floral. Finishing roasty, even slightly burnt, caramel. Highly carbonated medium body.
Old Saddleback Half Stock Ale;Pittsfield, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Old Saddleback Brewing Co.;Well, I know this beer is friggin old, cuz I spent some of my adolesence in Pittsfield, and these guys closed there doors a while a go. But I have a few of their bottles kickin around my refridge, and theyve been there too long, so here we go. Big frothy whip cream orangey head. Fruity malt nose. Orange reddish amber. Pale biscuity malts, sweet, light to medium bodied, fruity, big carbonation, finishing rather sweet with faint hops.
Old Saddleback Half Stock Ale;Pittsfield, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Old Saddleback Brewing Co.;Pours a dark ambery brown, with a light whitish head. Aroma is malty and a bit estery, with a decent hop presence. Flavor is well balanced, with enough hops to balance out the sweetness, but without taking over. Estery fruitiness in the middle, and finishing with a hint of breadiness. Good body on this beer, and carbonation is moderate, but lacking in that special something to make it memorable.
Old Saddleback Half Stock Ale;Pittsfield, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Old Saddleback Brewing Co.;A very nice aroma, rich and fruity, much like a belgian ale, the look is similar too. However the taste falls short, has hints of a realy good beer, but its just not quite all there. There is a strange slightly biter aftertaste that isnt too pleasing. Still not bad, and worth the 4 bucks I payed for the 6 pack.
Old Saddleback Half Stock Ale;Pittsfield, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Old Saddleback Brewing Co.;"Bottled. The best of the Old Saddleback offerings I had tonight, but not enough to get me to seek out their other products. Nice-looking ruby appearance with more head than I expected on this Irish red ale; flavor has decent balance and body, with some floral notes and caramel but really isn't very distinctive or memorable. Drinkable, but not worth any effort."
Old Saddleback Half Stock Ale;Pittsfield, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Old Saddleback Brewing Co.;Well balanced and hearty. Crisp taste that is refreshing...................
Growlers Powells Blueberry Wheat;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Growlers;It appears a little ugly & weak. A little too pink for my visual pleasure. There is little to no head and no carbonation at all. The aroma is minimal to say the least. The flavor was heavy on the grassy/wheat lineup but not much else, including a very faint berry profile.
Growlers Powells Blueberry Wheat;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Growlers;On tap at the MBF. Poured a moderate golden color with a thick head. The tatse does remind me of blueberries. Very carbonated. I’m not a big fan of fruity flavored beers, but this wasn’t bad. Not sure I could drink a lot of these because the 4 oz. sample I got was more than enough for me.
Growlers Powells Blueberry Wheat;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Growlers;Draught at brewpub: Cloudy pink-hued amber body with a small white frothy head that fades to a ring but lasts. Aroma is medium sweet fresh blueberries, wheat, and light yeast. Taste is sweet, but not overly so, with flavors of blueberries, tart wheat, light lemon, peppery yeast, and raspberry seeds. Light bodied, medium-lively carbonation that tingles the tongue until just after the swallow.
Growlers Powells Blueberry Wheat;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Growlers;Amazing fresh blueberry aroma, balanced with malt and wheat. A great fresh summery beer, but unfortunately the season for this one if too short. Excellent fruit beer!
Growlers Powells Blueberry Wheat;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Growlers;Golden purple, fizzy white head. Fresh blueberry juice aroma with light wheat overtones. Straight up balanced flavors of blueberry, malt and wheat. Not much more to say here. Light bodied, soft carbonation and drinkable by the growler. A perfect summer thirst quencher...
Growlers Powells Blueberry Wheat;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Growlers;A murky, medium brown color with a small off-white head. Smells like blueberries and wheat. Tastes initially like a normal pale ale with the blueberries joining in to take over the aftertaste. Perfectly balanaced and great for summer weather.
Growlers Powells Blueberry Wheat;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Growlers;Hazy peach snapple body topped by a light-purple-tinged white head. Aroma is sweet, fresh blueberry (good stuff, not artificial). Taste is mild sweet, some earthy, blueberry (present but not dominant, thank goodness), light earthy bitterness in the finish. Light-medium body, very drinkable.
Growlers Powells Blueberry Wheat;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Growlers;Draft... The color is a hazy copper with a pink/purple head. It smells fruity and sweet, like blueberries. The flavor is light and refreshing. Blueberries abound. Although very lightly carbonated, it has a smooth, crisp finish. Excellent summer brew!
Growlers Hardings IPA;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;IPA;Growlers;Decent IPA, has all the right characteristics, but needs a little more hop kick. very refreshing though. More like a strong pale ale than an IPA...lots of malt, darker color. Nose isn’t really there and hops fade from the palate a little quickly. Still, tastes good, if a little weak.
Growlers Hardings IPA;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;IPA;Growlers;Overall Impression: I haven’t had this one in a while, but I remember it being just OK, and not much more then that.
Growlers Hardings IPA;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;IPA;Growlers;On tap-Maryland Brewer’s Oktoberfest. Clear golden color w/a slight white head. Bitter hop flavor with not much to back it up. Seemed stale although the keg was very fresh, considering how they were rolling thru them @ this event. No wonder this Brewery always had the shortest line. Very average, wouldn’t buy it again.
Growlers Hardings IPA;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;IPA;Growlers;Very much subpar for an IPA. If its an IPA, wheres all the hop flavors. Not impressed. Lost my notes on this beer, so will have to rerate for certain. JKust remember being very disappointed.
Growlers Hardings IPA;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;IPA;Growlers;Clear dark amber color with a still tan head. Warm, high carbonation, means the keg was just put on. Slightly metallic tasting, with some waffle flavors too though, which is weird, has a decent flowery hop aroma, fruity and ripe, fresh smelling but at the same time you can still smell a mild diacetyl infection in this one, not nearly as potent as their other beers.
Growlers Hardings IPA;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;IPA;Growlers;Draft - Light amberish gold, creamy off white head. Nice English IPA nose of floral hoppiness that’s balanced with soft notes of butterscotch and caramel. Well bittered flavors of citrus and florals that again are nicely balanced with a soft sweet caramel malt backbone. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, bittersweet finish. Good stuff...
Growlers Hardings IPA;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;IPA;Growlers;Draft... Clear, golden ale with a mid-sized, creamy, khaki head. Excellent retention. Malty nose and palate. Fuzzy fruit esters and toffee notes with just a whisper of grapefruit in the aroma. Excellent balance. Great hopping prevents any real sweetness from tipping forward from its sturdy malt foundation. Full-bodied and oily with light carbonation. Lengthy, medium-bitter finish. Very nice English-style IPA. Earlier Rating: 3/20/2003 Total Score: 3.6 Draft... Crystal clear deep golden hue. Small, creamy white head with very interesting lacework. Mostly lasting. the aroma is very citrisy and floral. Lemon, grapefruit, black pepper, dandelion and clove. Very well balanced brew. Very malty and rich up front. Moderately bitter on the backside. Medium-bodied with a silky mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Lengthy, moderately bitter finish.
Growlers Hardings IPA;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;IPA;Growlers;Draught at brewpub: Clear pale amber with a small white head that quickly fades. Aroma is very mild hops, fruit, and light grains - not what you would expect from an IPA. This one is seriously lacking hops. Taste is berry seeds, mild grass, sweet syrupy light malts, sweet hop syrup. Light-medium bodied, medium amounts of carbonation.
Growlers Hardings IPA;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;IPA;Growlers;Average. Nice copper color with white head, but it fades fast. Slight copper/penny flavor at first then some hop flavor. Palate feels like high carbonation, but doesn’t show in head. Not bad, but probably wouldn’t buy it again.
Growlers Hardings IPA;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;IPA;Growlers;bottle. Just your run of the mill average (at best) IPA. A little more malt than I care for but I suppose it just goes along with the East Coast philosophy of IPA. Not my cup ’o tea.
Growlers Nut Brown Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Growlers;Pours dark brown/black. Tan brown head that retains well. Well carbonated. Nut and molasses flavors with the chocolate flavours and aromas of a dark ale. Medium bodied. Has a very sweet aroma and taste due to early ceasing of fermentation
Growlers Nut Brown Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Growlers;Dark, syrupy, and sweet. The malt is very up-front in this beer, and tastes nuttier than most nut browns. It’s sweeter than it needs to be (toffee-like), as if the fermentation was stopped too early. Overall, one of the better Growlers brews.
Growlers Nut Brown Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Growlers;Sampler on tap @ Balt Octoberfest : Deep mahogany brown color, with a very typical nutty ’brow ale flavor’. So my vocab isnt amazing, but a brown ale is a brown ale thus far in my beer-expirience. Minimal to zero hops, heavily malted.
Growlers Nut Brown Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Growlers;Rusty brown, light tan creamy head. Rich nose of buttermilk and cashews, with lesser notes of milk chocolate. Good balance between the soft nuttiness, chocolate, and the light hop bitterness. Light bodied, medium carbonation, dry, bittersweet finish. Compared with Hopscotch’s review, this one seems worked out to me now. A nice session brew...
Growlers Nut Brown Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Growlers;(Re-Rate as Growlers Nut Brown Ale on 8/7/2006) Draft... Clear copper ale with a mid-sized, creamy, beige head. Good retention. Nutty, chocolaty aroma and flavor, however there is definitely a trace of DMS in the beer... either that or someone washed my pint glass in the same sink as a plate full of mussels or shrimp. Just beneath all the hearty, chocolaty, nutty maltiness this beer promises to be, there’s a hint of shellfish. Talk about raining all over a beer guy’s parade? Anyway, once the joint gets that problem solved, you’ll run into a medium-bodied brown ale with a creamy mouthfeel, mild carbonation and a lengthy, astringent, chocolaty finish. Every brew I sampled on opening day impressed me except this. (Original Rating as Summit Station Nut Brown Ale on 3/18/2003) Draft... Crystal clear mohogany hue. Medium-sized, creamy, antique-white head. Patially lasting with very good lacing. The aroma is of milk chocolate, toasted cashews and Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee. Nice, moderately malty flavor. Milk chocolate and coffee up front. Well-balanced with mildly bitter hops and more milk chocolate on the backside. A touch earthy as well. Medium-bodied with a dry mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Short, dry finish with a hint of Kentucky bluegrass at the far end. Very enjoyable beer. Session beer. Original Score = 3.4
Growlers Nut Brown Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Growlers;On Tap, Summit Station Dark pour, with frothy beige head. Aroma malty, and nutty. First sip brings forth the nut and malt flavors. Nice mix together, little sweet toward the middle, and a slight hop kick in the finish. Nicely balanced, smooth, easy to drink.
Growlers Nut Brown Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Growlers;"Sampled on draught at the brewpub, and a 2 liter growler to go. The nose on this beer has some nice nutty malt aroma paired with some ""grainy"" malt aroma. The palate is soft, with some good nutty and pale malt flavors. This beer finishes malty and nutty up front, then ends slightly cloying, and with a mild hop bite to balance. Pretty straight foward Nut Brown Ale. Good drinking beer. Made for a nice pint at the bar, and would work well with dishes on Summits menu."
Growlers Nut Brown Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Growlers;Hazy mahogany body with beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, nutty, caramel, some chocolate, light nutmeg. Taste is moderately sweet, nutty, caramel, some chocolate, light earthy. Medium body, light sticky.
Growlers Nut Brown Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Growlers;Draught at brewpub: Clear dark amber/brown with a medium beige head that lasts. Aroma is toffee-covered chocolate, caramel, mild chocolate syrup. Taste is burnt toffee, nuts, chocolate, grains, and chaulk. Light-medium bodied, moderate carbonatoin. This was a nice brown, and well done in all aspects though the body was a touch watery.
Growlers Nut Brown Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Growlers;Surprisingly good. In the Sammy Smith's vein, but not league. Crazy malts lend a light porter view of toffee and caramel. Looks like a classic NBA. No complaints about the finish.
Summit Station Alt;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Summit Station Restaurant & Brewery;I wasn't looking to try this beer, but when a neighbor has a growler of it and offered up a glass, who was I to refuse? Red-black body topped by medium beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, roasty, caramel. Taste is fairly rich, medium sweet, roasty, some coffee, caramel, earthy, finish is roasty bitter with light earthiness. Medium body.
Summit Station Alt;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Summit Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draft... Sparkling clear mohogany hue with a small, off-white creamy head. Mostly diminishing with decent lacing. The aroma is of caramel, brown sugar and cola. Another perfectly balanced brew from Summit Station. Very malty and rich up front. Very lightly bitter and acetic on the backside. Light to medium-bodied. with a watery mouthfeel and almost non existant carbonation. Short, lightly pungent finish.
Growlers Diamond Stout;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Stout - Dry;Growlers;Draft - Dense brown, creamy tan head. Rich nose of light roasted coffee, cream, milk chocolate, and oatmeal, with soft tones of vanilla. Well balanced flavors of all the above. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, roasty, bittersweet finish. Nice session stout...
Growlers Diamond Stout;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Stout - Dry;Growlers;Nitro... This beer rocks! ... Pitch black ale with a mid-sized, creamy, beige head. Terrific retention. Chocolaty nose with a layer of vanilla and a whisper of acetaldehyde. Well-balanced, very chocolaty flavor with a touch of toffee. Smooth, toasted, gently burnt notes… not at all harsh. Almost full-bodied and very creamy with soft carbonation. Chocolaty, bitter, dry finish. More like a stout than a dry stout. World class brew! Earlier Rating: 3/18/2003 Total Score: 3.8 Draft... Very dark, clear ruby ale with a small, frothy, khaki head. The aroma has notes of dark chocolate, vanilla and deeply roasted cashews. The flavor is decently balanced with toasty to burnt notes of cocoa and charcoal. Full-bodied with a heavy, creamy mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Burnt, moderately bitter finish. Very imperialesque.
Growlers Diamond Stout;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Stout - Dry;Growlers;On Tap @ Summit Station Poured very dark with some ruby highlights, with small brownish head.

Overall not bad
Growlers Diamond Stout;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Stout - Dry;Growlers;Draught at brewpub: Clear dark brown with a small beige head that doesn’t last. Aroma: mild chocolate, unsweetened cocoa powder, and a light coffee scent. Flavor: toffee and chocolate, roasted grains, plum, light retronasal hops, vinous dark malts. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Bitter finish. This one gets points for the carbonation which is near perfect.
Growlers Diamond Stout;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Stout - Dry;Growlers;Reddish black with nice espresso head. Roasty, coffee aroma. Flavor is the same, though it's as strong a roasty coffee flavor as I can ever recall tasting. Malty bitter with healthy hops balance. Bitter aftertaste is relatively mild.
Growlers Diamond Stout;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Stout - Dry;Growlers;Is definitely very dry, singificant coffee in the roasts. Very roasty. Were this a bit stronger, it'd seem like an imperial to me.
Palm Springs Red Feather/Old Prospector Amber Ale;Palm Springs, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Palm Springs Brewing Co.;I remember dudes hunting down this beer in college (early-mid 90's) and proclaiming it was something special. I remember thinking it was extremely overrated. I distinctly recall a very dry finish and vague floral undertones.
Palm Springs Red Feather/Old Prospector Amber Ale;Palm Springs, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Palm Springs Brewing Co.;"They are no longer brewing beer. They got a big ($$$)contract to brew their root beer and gave up beer. Reddish brown color &#8211; medium head. Again a kind of mild beer. Yet, there is a hint of roasted malts, nearly no hoppyness"
Palm Springs Red Feather/Old Prospector Amber Ale;Palm Springs, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Palm Springs Brewing Co.;A good beer, not great. Nicely malted and fair hop bite, very clean and refreshing.
Palm Springs Golden Wheat;Palm Springs, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Palm Springs Brewing Co.;Very light and quite a refreshing beer. Wheat and malts evident in the nose. Not at all bitter as some wheats can be, even the non-wheaty lovers will like this beer.
Palm Springs Palm Canyon Porter;Palm Springs, California, United States;Porter;Palm Springs Brewing Co.;Porters and stouts are my favorite styles of beer, this one will rate high on my master list. Dark, coffee, chocolate and a beautiful subtle hop finish that's lip smacking good.
Charlevoix Bonté Divine;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;Acid/sour taste that is perfect for this beer. Totally refreshing in the summer. Usually seems to have a chill hase.
Charlevoix Bonté Divine;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;Slightly sour, spicy, alcoholic apple cider aroma with notes of bitter orange. Golden amber coloured body with thin but dense white head that lasts nicely. Oranges carry through to the sweet, biscuity flavour more-so than apples. Some citrusy lemon also notable. Creamy medium body with slightly prickly mouthfeel. Restrained but exciting. This is a mild yet enticing Belgian Strong. Very easy to drink... Enjoyed it cold - as it warms up, diacetyl becomes very noticeable in both the aroma and flavour. I would bump down aroma by two, flavour by four points,palate by two and overall by four because of this. Score as rated splits the difference - originally - 6,4,7,4,13=3.4. Drink it cold - at warmer temperatures, not so good - 4,4,3,2,9=2.2. Bottle.
Charlevoix Bonté Divine;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;The nose was interesting with green apples, chocolate, earthy notes and just a hint of cotton candy. The taste is of green apples, sour malt and an astringent finish. To me it seemed like a brown ale, but maybe I am out of it.
Charlevoix Bonté Divine;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;(66o ml bottle) Pours a medium, creamy, quick dissipating, almond head and a cloudy copper body. Aroma of sweet malt, strong whiskey and oranges. Somewhat contrast thin body and tart flavour to the aroma. Light, biting alcohol, mid-palate of a sour port and bouncing market fruit - oranges and apples. Finish of a sour apple cider...
Charlevoix Bonté Divine;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;Poured, this beer is dark brown with a thin head with no legs (doesn''t last). It has a good strong malt backbone, with some strange spicing rising to the palate. Certainly sweet orange peels, but others, perhaps some cinamin, and some cloves but everything is at the edge of perception, more like a suggestion...
Charlevoix Bonté Divine;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;A good bottle is a thick and luscious apple cider…Spring spices on a bed of sugary fruit… A bad bottle is cloying metal and rotten fruit…The brewer of this tiny and far microbrewery is known though to travel many miles to take some old bottles of his off of shelves which do not treat them well…Worth a try…
Charlevoix Bonté Divine;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;Stange brew.Nose has a bit of smoke and spices.Dry and crisp mouthfeel but also pretty short.Has lots of yeast and ends with a vinegar/white pepper finish.Nothing more than a curiosity
Charlevoix Bonté Divine;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;It is back on the market. Dark hazy amber with a head that won't last. Lemon, yeast, spices, apricot and a bit of bubble gum aroma. This beer isn't sure if it wants to be sweet, acid or anything else as a matter of fact. It didn't impress me.
Charlevoix Bonté Divine;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;I guess it is back on the market now. Dark amber, yeasty, medicinal Belgian session ale. Bov is right about it not being one of the finer examples.
Charlevoix Bonté Divine;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;"nothing to do with ""divin"" ! this one does not deserve to be a belgian ale."
Charlevoix Maillard Pils;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;A predominant hop dirt in the end is preceded by a lingering yeast and dry wheat...A light lemon breeze blows and brings over pure water from above...The faint aftertaste is admitted in their description, as this is obviously the house blond offering...
Charlevoix Maillard Pils;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;As far as I know, this is the light lager they serve at the ski lodge of Le Massif. It is a typical american/canadian innofensive micro lager.
Lindens Sax-a-Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lindens Brewing Company;Some bitterness but overall lack of a nice floral character. Lacking in well done malt/hop balancing. Neat brewery though.
Lindens Sax-a-Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lindens Brewing Company;On tap: creamy white head. Hoppy aroma. Copper, amber color, hazy. Pacific North West haziness/hoppiness. Lingering hoppiness.
Lindens Sax-a-Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lindens Brewing Company;Draught. Body is light amber. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted light bread), moderately hoppy (grapefruit, resin), lightly yeasty (dough). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation, moderately astringent.
Lindens Sax-a-Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lindens Brewing Company;GABF 2002: Sparkling dark golden colour. Caramel aroma. Weak flavour. Uninspiring.
Lindens Sax-a-Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lindens Brewing Company;Nice lace with a bright golden hue. Cool and refreshing. Flowery aroma hops seemed a little undeveloped, and didn't seem to reach their full potential. Mouthfeel was a bit watery. While I liked the earthy malt flavors, I would've liked to see a little more malt backbone... and maybe hops with more hairs on their chests. Decent bitterness builds though.
Lindens Sax-a-Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lindens Brewing Company;I just don't get the malt that theoretically rounds out this rather limpid hop juice.
Lindens Percussion Porter;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Porter;Lindens Brewing Company;A dark ruby brown with an aspiring lacy head--nice looking. Aroma is yeasty, burnt, black patent malt, soy sauce, and a sort of whiskey sour smell. Flavor is very bitter and astringent but dry and very stark. I didn't get much hop flavor, but what I did get was grapefruit/flower petals.
Lindens Percussion Porter;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Porter;Lindens Brewing Company;Cask-conditioned, hand pulled: They added extra hops to this one when they cask conditioned it. Creamy, body and head. Head stuck around for the whole pint. The coffee and chocolate were present but subdued. Also, acidic. A lot more hoppy than most porters. Fair amount of carbonation. I need to try the regular version of this porter for comparison.
Lindens Percussion Porter;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Porter;Lindens Brewing Company;Draught. Body is dark brown to black. Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, dark chocolate), moderately hoppy (grapefruit). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately astringent. Too citric-hoppy/acidic for my liking.
Lindens Percussion Porter;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Porter;Lindens Brewing Company;Very nice and dark, deep-red hue with a frothy head. Aroma was nice: coffee, roasted and sweet. Very atypical porter though, stylistically speaking. Hops were very sweet and grapefruity, and they masked the malts, if you can believe it. Me being a hophead, I was torn. I loved the grapefruit/citric flavors, but not necessarily in a porter.
Lindens Percussion Porter;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Porter;Lindens Brewing Company;Best aroma in the brewpub and a fine roastiness, but this is balanced by a sour grassiness that doesn't endear me to it. The thing gets more roasty-sweet and less sour as you go.
Lindens Percussion Porter;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Porter;Lindens Brewing Company;Not a typical porter. Very Hoppy/Stemmy. Tastes quite fresh and strong, Almost like over stepped tea, although it works for this beer. I really enjoyed it.
Tied House Alpine Gold;Mountain View, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tied House Brewing;Draft at Tied House. Don’t be hating folks, this actually a pretty tasty golden. Clear and bright, small head, big, bold grainy aroma and taste. Bready and sweet. Tasty to a fault, minor bite, leaves the palate clean.
Tied House Alpine Gold;Mountain View, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tied House Brewing;On tap @ Tied House. Clear golden beer with a white head. Aroma and flavor are both really quite sweet. Get some honey, grains, and corn flakes. A light baked apple ester aroma. There is sort of a grainy and chalky bitterness to the flavor that I could do without. Also very sugary tasting and intensely sweet. Some caramel to go along with all the cereal. Meh.
Tied House Alpine Gold;Mountain View, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tied House Brewing;Draft at Tied House in Mountain View. Pale good. Light. Grains, bread, and some spice. Bit of lemon. It is pretty sweet but also, finishes fairly dry for the style. Solid.

Tied House Cascade Amber;Mountain View, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tied House Brewing;Draft at brewpub. Amber body, clear, silky head, solid lacing coats the glass. Caramel malts in there, more so in taste than aroma. Aroma is weak. Taste is mildly sweet, but has an overall nice mouthfeel. Aside from the aroma, another winner.
Tied House Cascade Amber;Mountain View, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tied House Brewing;On tap @ Tied House. Clear caramel colored beer with a finger of off-white foam. Pretty much your typical caramel apple amber ale here. There’s a whole lot of acidity, too, which I don’t like. Some grassy, herbal, and earthy hops. Tastes kind of bland and flat. Some berry, apple, and lemon. Scroll past.

Tied House Cascade Amber;Mountain View, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tied House Brewing;Bottle from Bevmo: Created a soft and thin layer of foamed head while the liquid was a tea brown meets golden honey color. The aroma was rather fruity with scents of dried fruit such as apricot and plums. Flavors are tangy with a fruity yet soapy taste. There is a sweet finish and also allows for some notice of caramel malts, but I wouldn’t buy this again and only think of this amber as below par.
Tied House Cascade Amber;Mountain View, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tied House Brewing;On tap, sampler. Pours a very light amber, almost yellow. No real nose to speak of. Crisp attack, malty but very light. Finishes clean. Can drink a lot of them I guess, but nothing amazing.

Tied House Ironwood Dark;Mountain View, California, United States;Brown Ale;Tied House Brewing;Draft at brewpub. So far Ive been pleasantly surprised. This one leaves unimpressed, very much so. Dark amber, small skin of head. Faint malty aroma, barely there. Taste doesn’t improve things much, more cola than beer. Mildly sweet and nutty, but not enough to save this.
Tied House Ironwood Dark;Mountain View, California, United States;Brown Ale;Tied House Brewing;On tap @ Tied House. Darker amber colored beer with a thin layer of khaki foam. Pretty much a nutty brown ale here. There’s a nice toasted hazelnut and walnut thing going on. Some sweet caramel malts and a little bit of chocolate. Hints of coffee bitterness and earthy hops to balance the sweetness. Pretty decent, actually. Probably my favorite of their house beers.

Tied House Ironwood Dark;Mountain View, California, United States;Brown Ale;Tied House Brewing;Claims to be English style, but it’s much fizzier than most British ales. Not bad though.
Tied House New World Wheat;Mountain View, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Tied House Brewing;Draft at brewpub. This one too is a bit underwhelming. Faint aroma, grains pick up in taste, very cracker and biscuits. Kind of dry, a little honey sweetness. This one could go either way, but I didn’t like it as much as the first two.
Tied House New World Wheat;Mountain View, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Tied House Brewing;On tap @ Tied House. Slightly hazed straw colored beer with a thin, short lived, white head. There’s a fairly bland aroma to this. The flavor isn’t much more intense. Slight applesauce thing going on. There is a bit of tang and lemon character to this, too.

Tied House New World Wheat;Mountain View, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Tied House Brewing;Bottle from Bevmo: Created a thick layer of foamy head while the liquid was a glowing dirty blonde hue that was near opaque. The aroma was a sweet scent of malt, lemon, and bubblegum. Flavor was funky and had a wheat grain taste with a strange mutant yeast that has a fruity flavor but also an artificial sweetener taste. This wasn’t a wheat beer that could even remotely quench my thirst for beer on a hot summer day in the beginning of autumn.
Tied House New World Wheat;Mountain View, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Tied House Brewing;On tap, sampler. Cloudy gold, big head. Nose is malt and yeast, but weak. Tastes like a very lite heffy. Clean finish. Drinkable in large quantities. Kinda the them of the lighter beers at this place.

Tied House Oatmeal Stout;Mountain View, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Tied House Brewing;On tap @ Tied House. Black in color with a tan head. Smells mostly like roasted malt, but there’s some coffee, chocolate, and ash to it as well. The flavor is a little much for me. A whole lot of ash, burnt marshmallow, and some smoke. It’s also certainly quite thin and not terribly pleasant to me. Has some grassy and almost vegetal bitterness. Sort of metallic as well. No thanks.

Tied House Oktoberfest;Mountain View, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Tied House Brewing;Tap. I am usually not afan of their beers but this one is quite good. Itpours with an copper amber color. Aromas are dominated by malts and toffee. The flavors are also mainly malts, there is a subtle hoppy bitterness in the finish.

Tied House Amber Light;Mountain View, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tied House Brewing;"Draught at the brewpub. Clear dark red-amber color with a lasting beige head. One whiff and I almost couldn’t even take a sip. Massive diacetyl overload; an almost sickening amount of rancid butter. The beer is buttery and slick in the mouth. There is some caramel malt flavor and a touch of hops, but the diacetyl makes it pretty much moot. There is just no excuse to serve a beer like this. I get that they are probably using a house English yeast strain, but why is there so much trouble with diacetyl? This was by far the worst example, but the wheat and brown ale were also plagued by it."

Tied House Amber Light;Mountain View, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tied House Brewing;Draft at the brewpub. An amber beer with lazing beige head. The aroma has notes of malt and caramel. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt and caramel, leading to a lightly bitter and lightly nutty finish.
Tied House Amber Light;Mountain View, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tied House Brewing;On tap at the Tied House in Mountain View. Not a terrible light beer. Color is a light amber with a white head. Can definitely notice the presence of some Cascade hops one the aroma. Flavor is sweet malt (somewhat subdued) and more Cascade hops that redeem this beer somewhat. The absence of the usual hint of fresh piss that you expect in light beers is also a plus. Flavor is a little weak and it’s watery, but hey, it’s a light beer, and those don’t get too much better than this.
Tied House Amber Light;Mountain View, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tied House Brewing;"I am getting ""dirty"" smells - maybe this comes from the hop choice. Or, possibly the enzymes used break down the residual sugars? In either case, this aroma follows through to the pallete. Not very enjoyable"

Tied House Amber Light;Mountain View, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tied House Brewing;An amber light... hmmm. Overall the aroma and the appearance are entirely like that of Cascade amber. After that, the flavor is incredibly weak and os disappointing. Stick to the normal amber.
Tied House Amber Light;Mountain View, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tied House Brewing;On tap. Appearance, aroma and taste much similar to a average pilsner with an exception for a little hint of cascade hop in both aroma and taste. Not bad, but not very interesting either.
Tied House Raspberry Wheat;Mountain View, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tied House Brewing;Sample at the brewpub. Reddish-orange color with a thin white head that evaporates quickly to an outer ring. Spotty lacing. Aroma of wheat and raspberries. Light body with flavors of artificial raspberries and wheat. The finish is fruity with a mild berry aftertaste. Slightly above average overall.
Tied House Raspberry Wheat;Mountain View, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tied House Brewing;A nice beer. Has a nice raspberry aroma, but it could be stronger. As it seems to be with most of their beers, they could make them a lot better but most of them seem a little watered down. Flavor of raspberyry is a nice change but kind of weak
Tied House Raspberry Wheat;Mountain View, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tied House Brewing;Draft at the San Jose brewery. Pours fizzy yellow with a disappearing white head. Vacant nose, attack, palate, and finish, other than a cloying raspberry syrup additive. I think they need to cut the extract by about 40% and the water by about 20% and maybe they’ll be onto something. They wouldn’t be on to anything to write home about, but as it is this is a sticky mess.
Tied House Raspberry Wheat;Mountain View, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tied House Brewing;Pours hazy golden with thin white head. Aroma is of raspberries and not much else. Just imagine one of those raspberry smirnoff ice things and thats exactly what this beer tastes like, smells like, body, etc.
Tied House Passion Pale;Mountain View, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tied House Brewing;On tap, sampler. Clear yellow gold with minimal head. Nose is malt and fruit. The fruit in the beer is very mild and seems to work, still its an odd combo and finishes a bit wet and muddy for me. Won’t be trying it again.
Tied House Passion Pale;Mountain View, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tied House Brewing;A - Clear golden-yellow color with a thin covering of white head with a bit of red in it. Fades quickly leaving behind some lacing. S - Aroma is a mix of wheat and some grains with some sugary sweet passion fruit smell and other fruit. Touch of citrus. T - Starts off with some wheat and other grain flavor withe a touch of fruity sweetness in the background. Through the middle, some stronger sweet passion fruit flavor come through with a bit of citrus. Finish is a mix of sweet fruity flavor and wheat. M - Medium-light bodied with moderate lively carbonation. Smooth and crisp but a bit watery and empty. D - Very drinkable. The beer feels a bit empty and the fruit flavor is a bit too sugary overall.
Tied House Passion Pale;Mountain View, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tied House Brewing;Draught at the brewpub. The waitress said that they serve a rotating fruit beer that is the same base blond ale with a different fruit mixed in the serving tank. I lucked out and got passion fruit. Clear light gold in color with a lasting white head. Lots of sweet and lightly tangy passion fruit in the aroma. The flavor is an overload os sweet passion-syrup. There is a light touch of malt flavor and maybe a suggestion of hops, but this is all-passion, all the time. Sticky and cloying in the mouth. Much like the gold, this is way too sweet and hardly drinkable.
Tied House Passion Pale;Mountain View, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tied House Brewing;"On tap at the Tied House in Mountain View. Didn’t really inspire any ""passion"" in me. Golden color, white head. Aroma was sweet malts and passion fruit, maybe a little citrus. Tastes like a mediocre American pale ale with subdued hops and with a weird flavor thrown in that I’m guessing is the passion fruit. Not very balanced. Average palate."

Tied House Passion Pale;Mountain View, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tied House Brewing;On tap. Quite pale body with a small disappearing head. Not much aroma. Flavor is mild with a little harsh bitterness, maybe a hint of passion as well somewhere. Short aftertaste. Not bad, but a little bit more of everything could not hurt.
Tied House Passion Pale;Mountain View, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tied House Brewing;on tap.Deep gold with lasting head.. Herbal fruity nose. Sweet passionfruit fore and mid taste with creamy malt finish
Tied House Passion Pale;Mountain View, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tied House Brewing;Tap. Golden yellow with minimal head. Passion fruit flavor but less noticeable in the aroma. Favorably not an overwhelming fruit flavor, but it is too noticeable to make it a hint and not enough to just enjoy the fruit. A failure by landing in the middle.

Rio Grande Outlaw Lager;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Pours clear amber from the bottle. The frothy white head soon fades. Mild caramel, white bread aroma. Taste is sweet, a touch nutty, with a very mild bitterness at the finish. Body light to medium. Okay, but forgettable.
Rio Grande Outlaw Lager;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Nothing about this screams common - just a nondeScript step above a macro generic lager. Lightly malty, little hops...meh.
Rio Grande Outlaw Lager;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Seems I may like this more than others but to me it had nice flavor and hops and no bitter aftertaste. Consumed directly from the bottle. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Rio Grande Outlaw Lager;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Pours a gold-amber with a small white head and lacing. The aroma is faint sweet malt with a flavor that is sweet up front and a sweet, slightly crisp finish over a medium-light body. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Rio Grande Outlaw Lager;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;This is not a good lager. There’s way too much kilned and caramel malt in this lager. Almost tastes like a brown ale. Overall, I wish brewers would stop falling in love with crystal malt.
Rio Grande Outlaw Lager;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Malty and slightly sour lager, overall body is on the watery side. Dark amber with small foamy head, initial sourness in the aroma can be off-putting. Finish is mix of sour and bitter. This one may be a matter of personal taste.
Rio Grande Outlaw Lager;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Bottle:   Amberish, small sudsy white head, little lacing.   Sweaty stale bready aroma.   Touch nutty, touch biscuity.   Really nutty up front, no real sweat to speak of.   Slightly bready as well.   Moderate body and mouthfeel, however leaning thin.   Finishes quick, very soft nutty notes linger.   Pretty boring overall.   Develops a mealy background after the finish that ain’t all that pleasant.   Meh...
Rio Grande Outlaw Lager;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;ruby .. bottle .. mild caramel and baked beans .. actually quite nice, a freakin surprise .. . I signed up for a combination Retirement home and Cemetary. Its quite convenient.

Rio Grande Desert Pils;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Tap at the ABQ airport. Light pour, modest white lacing. Thin but crisp, slightly sweet, not a huge amount going on here but not particularly flawed either. Does the job for an airport bar beer.
Rio Grande Desert Pils;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Sampled at GABF 2016 with Paul and Larry. Pours a clear golden body with white lace. Light body and plain mouthfeel with generic grainy/corn notes. Very plain overall, not much else to say.
Rio Grande Elfego Bock;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;"it’s fun to go out on the road and pick up new beers, but the truth is, too often we find dwarfish little underachievers that scarcely rate three lines of commentary. this one is as brown as bran flakes, and about as interesting. a reasonable head puffed for show and then staked out a modest stronghold around the edge of the glass. besides some oxidation i gathered olfactory evidence of dunkel-like sweet and well-browned malts, which could generously be likened to a whole wheat pancake with a bit of maple, and a bit of baked carrot. indeed it is sweet tasting, with dates and toast, watery feel, and a not quite a medium body fullness of flavor. very negligible hops allow the sugar water effect to linger which is not the best way to finish. could be considered a reasonable quencher down in arizona, particularly given that hellacious summer climate they endure. if you’re a gila monster toasting in that desert inferno, you’d probably love a cool dish of elfego ""bock"". any gila monsters listening out there? i got a half bottle of elfego right here with your name on it!"
Rio Grande Elfego Bock;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;I too was disappointed by this one. I don’t know if it was the bock title or not, but this wasn’t anything German. Somewhat of a burnt and yeasty aroma and flavor. Hops were noticeable and didn’t seem to match the beer.
Rio Grande Elfego Bock;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Redddish copper brown with a creamy off-white head. Rather bizarre aroma of cocoa, berries and olive juice. In mouth, rather thin beer with sweet malt, light acidic points, and no hops. Rather boring. Cant remember where I got this bottle, maybe from Degarth?
Rio Grande Elfego Bock;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;This beer produces an aroma tha resembles burnt semi-sweet chocolate and raisins. As far as looks go, this beer could pass for a glass of tea. It is flat and watery and only produces a taste of crackers in the aftertaste.
Rio Grande Elfego Bock;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Bought this bottle on a trip to New Mexico. Pours with a spare tan head adn a clear mahogany body. Aroma is light but has wet cardboard and malt. This is thin and watery with very little carbonation. Not a bad beer at all. I’m too hungover to type anymore than that.
Rio Grande Elfego Bock;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Pours a small tan head that settles down quickly. Brown color, light red hue, clarity is very good. Faint malt nose, grainy notes. Body is light, lightly carbonated, watery. Lightly sweet malt flavors, caramel and buttery notes with a bit of chalkiness in the finish. Finish is almost dry. Degarth Delivered this bottle, Thanks man!
Rio Grande Elfego Bock;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Thanks Tim. Toffee/caramel nose - slightly earthy with a hint of hops. Copper body, fluffy off white head that fades quickly. Flavor is sweet caramel malt - more of a brown ale than a bock. A bit of maple in the finish.
Rio Grande Elfego Bock;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;If these beer selections don’t get better I am gonna rethink the whole beer of the month thing. Bleck.
Rio Grande Elfego Bock;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Botted beer of the month. Ok beer. Nothing special. Had a sweet malt taste going but that was it.
Rio Grande Elfego Bock;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Not very good. Dark amber with thin white head. Faint aroma of sweet malt. Thin and watery and carbonated. Little or no flavor beyond what you could get from a BMC.

Really nice Hatch chile aroma and flavor in a light bodied beer - I really like it (but roasted Hatch chiles are one of my favorite things on earth).
Rio Grande Pancho Verde Chile Cerveza;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;C+. Pours a clear golden color with white head. The description is absolutely right. I was skeptical of the pepper because I've had one before and it was awful, but this one wasn't bad
Rio Grande Pancho Verde Chile Cerveza;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;12 ounce bottle from wchesser. The beer is a clear gold with a white head of foam. Strong roasted chile pepper aroma. Fairly vegetal. Medium body and medium carbonation. Kind of gross, but also exactly what I expected. Would be a good cooking beer.

Rio Grande Pancho Verde Chile Cerveza;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Pours gold from the bottle. The white fizzy head fades fast. Aroma has a soft malty base with noticeable chili. Taste is very sweet, with a strong chili inflection. Finishes sweet and spicy. Feels contrived, and lacks all nuance. Quickly wears out its welcome.
Rio Grande Pancho Verde Chile Cerveza;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Head literally runs away, sickly yellow appearance. Nose/taste of corn, peppers, mildly spicy, palate finish of a soda. Not really even like a beer.
Rio Grande Pancho Verde Chile Cerveza;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;APPEARANCE- looks like a lager. Head is fizzy, and short lived. NOSE- um, none. FLAVOR- tastes like super cheap lager And hardly any Chile flavor.
Rio Grande Bock Holiday;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Rio Grande Brewing Co.;Loose soapy white head and golden-amber body with flaky suspended particles. Munich malts dominate in the nose with elements of well-toasted bread crusts, a note of toffee, and iced tea. Toasty malt flavor with a twangy extract quality. Some warm spicy properties and a mild hop presence. Body is flat and a little watery, especially for a doppelbock. Not bad overall.
Snake River Pale Ale;Jackson, Wyoming, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Snake River Brewing Co.;Of all the groovy things of the 70s (moon landings, shag carpet, psychedelic drugs, macrame, bell bottoms & watergate) this beer does not belong on this list. Blatz does. Snake River Pale Ale? Do you think Evel Knevel was drinking this junk when he tried (on September 8, 1974) jumping the Snake River....and failed, oh-so miserably? Hell to the no. That wily fuck was loaded on Blatz, inspiring the kids of the 70s to look up to him like the demi-god that he was. Sure he may have crashed and burned, and failed miserably in his idiotic stunt, but when you are as full of Blatz as he undoubtedly was no one could care less.....himself, the spectators, the worldwide TV audience...... Blatz? Why not?

The taste is of roasted malts, bread, caramel and some hops. Similar aroma. Has a full body with a bit of bitterness. An excellent brew. Made my trip up to Idaho and back worth it.
Snake River Alpine Fest Lager;Jackson, Wyoming, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Snake River Brewing Co.;"On draught at the local Old Chicago. It poured a gorgeous red colour with about a half inch of foam. There would probably have been more but the bartender is pretty meticulous about beer vs foam and I appreciated that. The smell was malty, toasty, and there was a smidgeon of some hop action going on. The taste was damn good. What I expected from a well made sample of the style. Caramel malt with a good but not overdone side order of bread, a bit of a graininess, and a light sprinkling of hop bitterness. Well done brew and I found it very easy to drink; very good tasting and very good mouthfeel. I’ll be drinking more during OC’s Oktoberfest mini tour!"

Spaten Optimator;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu (AB InBev);12 oz bottle, pours reddish brown clear. Medium body, aroma of dark fruits and malt. Bready raisin taste with slightly bitter finish.
Spaten Optimator;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu (AB InBev);Appearance of coca cola and some of the sweetness too. Figs and licorice in the flavour with heavy malt backbone. Morello cherry tartness stops it being over the top in my opinion. I like this style anyway and thought this was an interesting and worthy example.

Twenty Tank Red Top Ale;San Francisco, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Twenty Tank Brewery;Alas, Twenty Tank is no more. A victim to the rising rents in a neighborhood the Tank made trendy. But the beers were good if not amazing. The Red Top was a moderatly hopped red ale with a distinctive creamy texture. The recipe called for torified barley to obtain that nice smooth mouth feel.

Twenty Tank Pollywanna Porter;San Francisco, California, United States;Porter;Twenty Tank Brewery;This was last consumed exactly one year to the day after they closed. Great porter Big vinous chewy roasted brew of great depth. Espresso and cocoa beans nice finish.
Twenty Tank Pollywanna Porter;San Francisco, California, United States;Porter;Twenty Tank Brewery;This was my favorite porter on tap for a long time, but then the brewery closed down. This was a coffee-heavy brew with some hints of chocolate and possibly brown sugar. It was impossible to taste a cup of coffee after drinking this beer as the coffee essence of the beer was THAT strong. Great stuff, shame about the brewery.

Unibroue Seigneuriale;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Unibroue (Sapporo);750ml bottle: This one pours a murky, oxidized copper color. There was a wisp of an off-white head that left no lacing. Good nose. Yeasty and bready. Some grains, biscuit, faint spice and fruits. The taste is very good. Bready and yeasty, some spiciness, fruits, malts, grains, biscuit. A lot in there with nothing really on top of anything else. Just an excellent blend of flavors. I would definitely buy this one again.
Seigneuriale Triple;Boucherville, Quebec, Canada;Tripel;Brasserie Seigneuriale (Sleeman);750ml bottle pours a golden orangeish color with a huge white head that leaves a healthy lacing on the glass. Aroma is llight fruits and spices with some yeast and alcohol. Taste is fruity and malty sweetness with spices and yeast and a light hop bitterness.

Seigneuriale Blonde;Boucherville, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Seigneuriale (Sleeman);500ml bottle pours a pale cloudy golden color with 2 fingers of white head which settles quickly leaving only a few spots of lacing on the glass.

JW Dundees Honey Light Brown;Rochester, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);On tap at Valhalla. Not too outstanding. Very sweet, almost syrupy. Too much for my taste, but drinkable.
JW Dundees Honey Light Brown;Rochester, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Amber with a small white head. Weak malt aroma. Thin and dry flavour with honey notes.
JW Dundees Honey Light Brown;Rochester, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A lighter version of the JW Dundee’s honey brown is not a bad idea, in my opinion. I don’t mind the regular, and I could see drinking this as a Yuengling lagel or Sam Adams light substitute on a hot summer day.
JW Dundees Honey Light Brown;Rochester, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);this is the most digusting foul beer that i have had the displeasure of tasting in a long while,why does anyone even buy this crap?
JW Dundees Honey Light Brown;Rochester, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This is ABSOLUTE shit!!! I hate honey brown, they somehow took shit and found a way to make it shittier!
JW Dundees Honey Light Brown;Rochester, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);As far as im concerned there's no reason to water down a honey brown, its weak enough as it is. Damn that Hillsdale Kroger for selling this, damn them
JW Dundees Honey Light Brown;Rochester, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);even worse than the original. For those who actually like this crap, I hope one day you will be able to appreciate a real beer.
JW Dundees Honey Light Brown;Rochester, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);has an slighly off smell and a rather sour taste. oddly popular for an unpleasant beer
JW Dundees Honey Light Brown;Rochester, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This beer's popularity is waning. I remember the big Honey Brown craze a few years ago. What was up with that?
JW Dundees Honey Light Brown;Rochester, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);My ex used to love this stuff. I never stole any from her, if that says anything. Seems like everything that might have given it decent flavor was fermented, leaving a funny smelling, neutral tasting brew.

Speakeasy Satchmo Stout;San Francisco, California, United States;Stout;Speakeasy Ales and Lagers;"so after tromping around san francisco for 20+ blocks we all had to piss real bad, i said ’the next bar we find were going into’, so we end up at this little hole in the wall bar that didn’t even have a sign (somewhat speak easy-esque) and as we all order out drinks we all find out that we all received free drinks, we had free drinks all night!! it was the first night this place opened and they were giving out free drinks all night as some sort of a promotional deal. my friends took full advantage, drinking top shelf liqour, i however stuck to this beer all night, i wasn;t able to fir as many in me as they were with the grey goose, but i’m not about to complain. black body wth a frothy brown head, Rich mocha nose and flavor, sweet chocolate malts, extremely roasty and warming, thick and divine.

Speakeasy Satchmo Stout;San Francisco, California, United States;Stout;Speakeasy Ales and Lagers;Rich and creamy, chocolate and toasted grains, with a bit of hops to boot, really a top notch brew, and the bottles are beautiful, and the beer is even better from a nice pint glass, along with the Tornado, my heart belongs San Francisco's breweries!
Marin Harvest Ale;Larkspur, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Marin Brewing Company;Sampled as part of a sampler pack. Aroma was mild hops and sweet malts. Appearance was light brown with a thin lacey head. Mouthfeel was a little harsh and flavor lacked any kick of hops you expect from a harvest ale.
Marin Harvest Ale;Larkspur, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Marin Brewing Company;"1998 vintage, thx to herbjones for this taste. Orange-amber color, smallish head, sweet malty aroma. Malt dominate; honey, toffee roasted just a bit. Real good if you’re in the malty mood."

Carlton Sheaf Stout;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);"Aroma is almost whiskey-like, then smoky, roasted, but still alcohol. Black - opaque, with bubbles visible just at the glass. Tall tan head, thick and creamy. The head recedes moderately, leaving bubbly lacing. Feel is thin to moderate. Initial taste is dark fruit and roasted malts, transitioning to a slightly astringent bitterness in the middle and finish. Aftertaste is dry and somewhat bitter. The middle and finish also has an odd earthiness that is hard to describe; not unpleasant, just unusual. Overall, seems to be a bit of a cross between an English Stout and a Dry Irish Stout. Good enough to buy again (but, I probably won't)."
Carlton Sheaf Stout;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Bottle from convenient store in Santa Cruz, CA (near Westerhold house).

Carlton Sheaf Stout;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Bottle @ RBSG 2015. Thanks, Ferris. Black in color with a big khaki head. Smells like a mix of cardboard and chocolate syrup. Sort of metallic and grassy as well. Hints of coffee grounds, roasted malt, and toasted bread. Doesn’t really taste much better, either. Sort of oxidized and cardboardy. Sweet, sugary chocolate sauce and caramel. Bitter metallic, roast, and coffee grounds finish.

Hacker-Pschorr Münchner Dunkel (Alt Munich Dark);Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5%. Opaque dark, a very bright light reveals some toffee brown at the edges. Good-sized reasonable duration foamy head. Moderate carbonation. Somewhat burnt sweet malt aroma. Very slight grassy/earthy hops, relatively thick texture but still has that dunkel thinness in comparison to its stout lookalikes, star of the show is the toffee sweet slightly burnt sugar toasty malt. Very straightforward, knows exactly what it wants to do and does it. Has only enough lager characteristics to stop it being something else entirely. Splendid dunkel. Augustiner's might be better-made, Ayinger's definitely shows off more brewing skill and ingredients, but this just plain hits the spot. I'm keen to compare Ayinger's unfiltered dunkel to this, to see if it's the naturtrueb nature that makes this go down such a treat.

Hacker-Pschorr Münchner Dunkel (Alt Munich Dark);Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Clear brown, orange when exposed to light. Creamy brownish white head, three fingers, good retention. Lots of carbonation visually. Texture is watery, with little fizz and some density. Aroma is malty, caramel, chocolate, nuts, bread, butterscotch. Taste follows the aroma. Really malty, caramelly, in a positive way. Almost sweet. Bittersweet ending with notes of nuts and caramel. Alcohol well integrated. Good representation of a Dunkel, I suppose.

P- Medium body, average texture, average carbonation, balanced finish. O- Pain in the ass finding this beer. Brewed by Paulaner when I was busy searching for Hacker Pschorr. Menu listed it simply as Hacker Pschorr dark bier. I do not like German beer menus I've learned. Makes for tough rating.
Hacker-Pschorr Münchner Dunkel (Alt Munich Dark);Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Tawny brown pour, thin tan head. Nose is roasted malt. Middle is light toffee, dark kilned malt, herbal bitterness. Finish is malty. Nice dunkel.

Aroma has toasted malt, brown sugar and some burnt caramel notes. Taste is grainy with dark bread crust notes, toasted malts and some bitterness on the finish to balance out the flavors. Medium body and carbonation. Overall it's a decent dark lager with no obvious flaws but it really lacks personality.
Hacker-Pschorr Münchner Dunkel (Alt Munich Dark);Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500ml bottle bought from the Offie, Leicester.

Pacific Rim Wheat Doppelbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;............................................................................
Hale's Wee Heavy;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hale's Ales;Bottle. Orange amber, golden head. Bready toffee aroma and flavour, a touch of orange peel, a bit boozy.
Hale's Wee Heavy;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hale's Ales;[3/3/15] Draught at Hales Ales Brewery & Pub in Seattle. Clear amber. Aroma of malt, caramel and toffee. Sweet malty flavor with caramel, toffee and a drier finish. Medium-bodied.
Hale's Wee Heavy;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hale's Ales;I love the way this all comes together, some savory winter spices blending perfectly with the peaty character of the Scotch ale. Nice fluffy head on a cloudy dark copper body. Earthy, malty aroma. Taste brings more winter spice, which lingers afterward. All around a great winter warmer.
Hale's Wee Heavy;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hale's Ales;First sip was funky. Decided to let it open up and the flavors started to coincide with each other quite nicely.
Hale's Wee Heavy;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hale's Ales;On tap at Stateside, pours a hazy amber orange with a small white head. Aroma brings out caramel, brown sugar, and bready malt. Flavour is less sweet than expected, with notes of caramel, bready malt, and a fairly prominent spiciness in there that cuts down the sweetness. Balanced and drinkable, yet nothing overly provocative. Decent.
Hale's Wee Heavy;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hale's Ales;Bottle (12oz $1.80): Golden brown with 1-2 finger white head. This was different than other Wee Heavys I have had. Its sweet and bitter. medium plus body.. syrupy.
Hale's Wee Heavy;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hale's Ales;12oz bottle poured into Gordon’s thistle glass. Surprisingly there is some particles, floaties in this beer despite the clear bottom of the bottle. A dark amber-brown color. A glow o the beer with low clarity. A medium sized head that leaves a surface covering lacing. Aroma is slightly grassy with a slightly syrupy malt character. Its not hoppy, its not too sweet (yet there is a faint barley syrup candy aspect). In the flavor there is also a bit of toffee and slightly fruity. But this is pretty damn good for a six pack Scotch Ale. Medium body with an aftertaste of light fruit-syrup.
Hale's Wee Heavy;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hale's Ales;"Draught at Hales Ales Brewery and Pub Cloudy dark amber color with creamy head. Light aroma. Smooth mouthfeel, quite round, with moderate residual sweetness; good Scottish malt flavor, lightly smokey, lean, lightly fruity; correct bitterness. Pleasant drink."
Hale's Wee Heavy;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hale's Ales;Bottle. Pours a hazy brown color with a smallish off-white head on it. Nose has a little bit of toast and nuts in there, with just a hint of some spices in there. Taste is also pretty spicy, with a hint of some sweetness up front. Meh.
Hale's Wee Heavy;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Hale's Ales;Bottle from the Wine and Beer Haus, Seaside, OR. Caramel malt aroma with some hoppiness. Pours a deep caramel color with a thin beige head and very little lacing. Caramel malt flavor though a little watery. Finishes dry with some hops as well as some metallic flavors which is unfavorable. Ok scotch ale but the finish isn't good. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Belle Gueule Originale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Brasseurs RJ;2014 rating. Pours an average size foamy off white head and has a pale golden, light amber appearance. Very bubbly. Ok lacing. Aromas of light malts, grains, corn and a bit of barley. Flavours are mainly sweet malts, mild grains and wheats. Some notes of herbal hops. Pretty excessive carbonation. Medium retention. Tingling and somewhat astringent mouthfeel. An ok beer.
Belle Gueule Originale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Brasseurs RJ;Can from local iga grocery A: corn, light caramel, light cereal App: brilliantly clear copper lasting smallish white head.

Belle Gueule Originale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Brasseurs RJ;Bright straw color with weak activity. White 1 finger head, lasts 5 minutes, with poor legs. Aromas and flavors of corn, sweet roasted malts, a little herbal spices. High on the sugar with a syrupy feel, and bit bready. Slick light body with moderate carbonation. Faint finish ending with a roasted malt feel, slightly bitter dry. Overall a dull craft having faint watery adjunct flavors. Too sugary and thin, but still fresh. Even from tap it doesn’t help.
Deschutes Bachelor ESB;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Deschutes Brewery;"From May 2007 . Purchased at Poplar Wine and Spirits in Casper. This pours from 12oz bottle(best by 04-06-07) a clear amber with a good head of foam that shrinks fairly slowly to a fin layer and it has some good lacing. The smell has a nice hoppy nose with notes of caramel and biscuit. The taste has big notes of floral hops up front with biscuit and caramel malt following in the background. That's a pretty bitter start to this session but it all balances out nicely with the ample malt presence. Further sips in and I'm getting some grapefruit mixed in with the floral hops and it kind of makes my mouth pucker a little but the malt *never* lets the hops get out of hand and *that's* working for me because it makes me want to take more sips and that's always a good thing. ;^) The finish is very dry and the mouthfeel, for me, is spot on for the style. This is a very good ESB and I'm glad that it's back in town after being absent for many years. I'm just hoping that I can get some fresher samples so I can compare and perhaps update this review."

Deschutes Bachelor ESB;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Deschutes Brewery;nice sticky head.. good lacing... hazy amber brews. grassy floral hops are very well balanced with fruity yeasty notes and lite toffee and toasted malts.

Deschutes Bachelor ESB;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Deschutes Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy orange to glossed over brown color. Bar pour yielded barely a head. Barely any lacing was around the glass. The smell had a toasted caramel nuttiness over and underneath. The taste was somewhat sweet nutty maltiness. There’s a dry sweet roasted nutty aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a slight sessionability about it. The carbonation finishes slightly smooth. Overall, good ESB. Too bad, it’s been retired.
Deschutes Bachelor ESB;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Deschutes Brewery;Best by: 05JUL11 A: Pours a toasted caramel ale with a single finger of yellow soapy head which falls in a few minutes to a broken sheet of the same. Excellent clarity. Rings of lace. S: Creamy and sweet with good earthy bitterness. Slightest hint of oxidation (but this is expired, so I can’t dock for that). T: Extra bitter, and earthy. Definitely english in nature, with earthy and soily hops and the yeast is bready. M: This is medium bodied, but lacks a certain ’bounce’ I feel with most ESB’s. Carb is low end of moderate. O: Good, but not great. Pretty decent. And likely a bit of Homer in my grading as Deschutes is one of my favorites. Serving type: bottle 07-27-2011

Deschutes Bachelor ESB;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Deschutes Brewery;I like this one better than their pale ale--more hops but not enough to make it a bitter. Tastes more like a pale ale.

Deschutes Bond Street Brown Ale;Bend, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Deschutes Brewery;"15-Dec-05 (22 oz bottle: $3.49 at Bottleworks in Seattle, WA) Since I also have a bottle of this beer, I thought it should get a more thorough rating, or at least be rated in a more ""rating friendly"" and controlled environment like my living room in front of my computer rather than a bar. This is definitely a mild brown ale, with very light roast in the flavor and nose. Mild sweetness, a fair amount of chocolate, and a bit o’ nuttiness in the flavor, and likewise in the nose, except that the beer does not have a very sweet aroma. Chocolate increases slightly as the beer warms up. Body is medium, with fairly mild carbonation. Light-medium brown, but with nearly perfect clarity. Light tan head pours to an inch in height, settling to a ring in a pretty normal fashion. True to the brewing style of Deschutes, this is an understated brown ale that has a nice flavor without trying to knock you over the head showing it.07-Aug-05 (Draft: Deschutes Brewery in Bend, OR) Ooh, this smells nice! Malty, very chocolaty, lightly roasty, the nose has me looking forward to tasting this beer. It’s not as chocolaty, but the roast almost takes on a sesame character. It’s fairly sweet, but the roast helps to keep the palate pretty clean and dry. Moderately bitter, but not especially hoppy. Light brown in color, with a light tan head that shows solid retention and a dense crochetwork of lace. Definitely the best of the seasonals I’ve tried today. (7, 4, 7, 4, 14, total 3.6)"

Deschutes Broken Top Bock;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Deschutes Brewery;"2007 Release Sampled December 2007 Pours with an initially, almost three-finger thick, lightly browned, tan colored head that sits atop a dark, weathered amber-brown colored brew. When held up to the light the beer shows a brilliantly clear, bright, yet concentrated, ruby red color. Quite malt focused, with an almost berry like, malt aroma. Concentrated, somewhat rich, malt notes of toffee, lightly browned, toasty malt, browned bread crust, a touch of brown sugar. This also has some nice, subtle hop aromatics that contribute to the light berry like fruitiness as well as provide a hint of an herbal edge. A nice and inviting aroma, not as rich and powerful as a Doppelbock for sure, but still nice and malt focused. Chewy, yet not too thick, this has lots of rich malt flavor to it without being overly sweet. The sweetness has a certain savory quality to it, what with the concentrated toffee notes and richly caramelized malt sugars. Towards the finish the malt character leans towards a touch of dusty cocoa, toasty, drying dark malt notes as well as a clean, almost concentrated dark fruit note. The hop character, while not huge here, is definitely noticeable; flavors of soft herbs is noticeable from the get go and even picks up a bit of steam towards the middle with notes of menthol and grassy pine flavors. This finishes with a soft, yet noticeable bitterness that I would not quite characterize as biting. Like a good, regular strength, Bock should be, this beer has a chewy heft to it without being thick; it is still fairly quaffable and would be a perfect beer to pair with dinner (it is not a sipping beer). I really like the depth of malt character that this achieves, yet it is not too thick, and it has a nice backdrop of hop character too. Quite the tasty Bock!"
Deschutes Broken Top Bock;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Deschutes Brewery;This brew had a good reception at a Deschutes featured event at Bardenay last year in Boise. I guess I’d have to like the bock style which I don’t but if I did...

Broken Top Bock pours a clear chesnut color. It has a large, foamy, dark beige head that leaves some lacing. Malt, fruit, caramel, and apple are in the aroma. The flavor is a nice blend of malts and caramelized fruit with a darker malt flavor (chocolate) in the roasty finish. This beer has a medium-full body and is smooth.

A picked up a single bottle at the nearby craft beer shop late last fall.

This just came out recently, so maybe 4 month best by date. So, lets see we have 4 ratings in 2011, 4 in 2012, 1 n 2013, 0 in 2014... well the rating scene in Seattle is growing old. Brown colored beer, not much head. Aroma smells of industrial plastic, metallic, and bug spray. Flavor is similar. Maybe I understand why no one is rating this beer. Its close to being macro level, un-nuanced, industrial flavored waste of fermented malted beverage. Low, even for Hale’s."

Hale's O'Brien's Harvest Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;Rating #1997 2015.09.27 #CraftTakesSeattle Day 4, Beer 99 – Draught at taproom/brewpub.Dark brown pour with a white/tan head. Earthy, roasted malt tempered with a punch of hoppy bitterness. Character of almonds, chestnuts, chocolate, toffee, citrus.
Hale's O'Brien's Harvest Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;dark amber slowly poured to leave quite a bit of yeast and other stuff in the bottle. Little lite tan head and no lacing. This is a big nose hoppy brew. Citrus and pine hop aromas with earthy and appropriate garden dirt. Wow... actually very complex for a simple APA. Floral notes mix perfectly with toasty bready malts. Flavor is the same, but with a bracing/balanced and lingering bitterness.. I am really liking this one. Oily hoppiness sticks to the inside of my mouth.
Hale's O'Brien's Harvest Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;Hazy to nearly cloudy dark copper color. A few chunks of yeast float about. Initial moderate head that settles to a small lid of tight, tiny, taupe tinted bubbles. Scents of caramel coated pine cones, along with toasted grain bread, and mild herbs. Fairly sweet and caramel-like in the front. Some marzipan and hint of alcohol as well. Touch of toffee as well just before the hops really start to kick in. Citric and pine flavors, and bitterness take the lead into the finish and linger. Acidity amps up in the late finish and linger. This is not your ordinary amber. 7/10
Hale's O'Brien's Harvest Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;12 ounce bottle from Whole Paycheck. Pours a dark copper color with a large white head.

Hale's O'Brien's Harvest Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;Bottle from Brewers Haven. Picking up some Belgian notes right away, yeasty, musty aroma.

Aroma is caramel malt. Flavor is sweet, with a bitter hops aftertaste. Overall I wasn’t immediately blown away, but then I realized how easily drinkable it is. Definitely worth checking out.
Hale's O'Brien's Harvest Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;On tap at Hale’s, pours a clear copper with a small beige head. Aroma brings out a mix of different hop varietals, with notes of citrus, pine and resin, some bready caramel malt as well. Flavour is both hop and malt heavy, with lots of resinous hops, which then transition to sweet caramel malt. After a while, the malt bill overtakes and leaves a rather high amount of sweetness. Okay, but nothing special.
Hale's O'Brien's Harvest Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;2015 version. Deep Amber with a firm white head. Nice pine and light citrus hops with a good portion of toasted caramel malts. Full bodied. Full flavored Amber with a good malt and hop balance. Highly enjoyable.

Hale's Pale (American) Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hale's Ales;"From Aug 2007 Purchased as part of a mixed 6Pack at Wilbur's in Ft Collins. It pours from 12oz bottle(some numbers etched on the bottom of the bottle: 258-0-2 0724) a deep gold with a small head of foam and...a lot of floaties. I hope that doesn't mean that I have a bottle that is *well* past it's best by date. Anywho, the foam lasts right through the session and it has lots of lacing. It'll be hard to score on appearance. :^( The smell is very hoppy by way of grapefruit and....it smells like how a dry hopped ale would taste. The taste is nicely balanced between some semi sweet malt and not too bitter hop character. The hops are more floral than anything else. I can't taste any grass and as far as citrus goes, there's just a touch of maybe, lemon. Overall, the flavour works for me. Now the malt kicks in again and I note some earthiness. The finish is slightly bitter and the mouthfeel is medium. I like it despite seeing those damn floaties when I raise my glass. Next time I see a bottle, I'm gonna check it out more thoroughly because if this bottle *is* past it's prime, a fresher sample would ""probably"" impress me even more."

Hale's Pale (American) Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hale's Ales;12 oz can, gift by luttonm. Not sure if he thought the gift was him giving the can, or me taking the can off his hands. Either way, I got a beer in my hand, I’m happy. A golden, hazy pour with a full foam cloud cover head. Juicy and hoppy, bright aroma. Flavor is creamy, a bit juicy, solid hop profile. No real bitterness noticeable througout. Drinks easy. Always nice to see a beer that’s been around since years before I was, and still on the shelves today. A good beer to keep a few ice cold, and enjoy, while taking in some ball games. Seems fitting anyway.

Hale's Cream Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Cream Ale;Hale's Ales;On tap at Parilla Grill. Looks like nitro without being on nitro. Velvety smooth and creamy, then goes down hill from there. Faint grainy aroma, taste is crackers and white bread. Nice mouth feel and texture to go with the look, but kind of bland overall.

Really need to work past it to figure out what the beer tastes like. Very corny, macro tasting. Tastes like minerals and not malts (rice or corn or whatever). Long cheap malt liquor aftertaste. Sticky flavors won’t leave my palate. Really good for blending with the BA lmpy Stout.
Hale's Cream Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Cream Ale;Hale's Ales;On nitro at ABV Pub in Hillsboro, OR. Faint aroma of grass. Creamy head with huge amounts of lacing. Taste is subdued, grass, just a hint of something resembling a German hefeweisen, but only a hint. Easy to drink but too easy, really. Not my beer.

Hale's Special Bitter (Cream HSB);Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hale's Ales;5oz at brewpub. Pretty nitro head from the nitro pour. Amber-copper clear beer. This tasted more like an English Pale than bitter to me. Aroma has hops present, despite the nitro. Nice English bright and clear minerally and earthy hops. Dusty, earthy malts below that. Low bitterness in both nose and flavor, which is nicely clean. Again, slightly dusty but clean malts with an apparent English hoppiness. Finishes clean. Soft nitro body. Good stuff.
Hale's Special Bitter (Cream HSB);Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hale's Ales;The server warned us about this one. But we just had to have the sampler - and this was the price we paid for that decision. Almost colorless, almost flavorless, with subtle hints of metal and cardboard. No. 2.

Poured dark reddish with a thick, floating, white head with constant retention. Super mild, very drinkable. Thin, soft mouthfeel. Some light doughy malt tones and just enough hops to balance the sweetness. Don’t expect much from this one, but when you need a session pint, it does the job.
Hale's Celebration Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Hale's Ales;Dark nut brown in appearance with a thin off-white head. Nice chocolatey aroma with a hint of cotton candy and molasses. Fruit comes out on the semi-sweet taste that finishes a little bitter. The bitterness almost seems as if it could be coming from the malts, but with some thought I am sure it is a hop bitterness. A good porter.
Hale's Celebration Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Hale's Ales;dark rum colored appearance with super fine carbonation bubbles, very small head and minimal lace, goor rich coffe/carmel aroma, with smooth chocolate taste and pleasant hop/carmalized sugar finish
Hale's Celebration Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Hale's Ales;Tan head. Smoky burnt nose. Dry roasted malt flavor. Good body.............
Hale's Celebration Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Hale's Ales;Black bodied with a ring of head and a twinge of amber. The atmospher, unfortunately was quite smokey. However, the aroma itself was undeniably smoky with a burnt attribute. The flavor was deep, dry coffee and by most accounts, this beer seemed akin to a lower a/c imperial stout. Need to sample again.
Hale's Celebration Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Hale's Ales;"Had this on a hand-engine...Aroma is malty--both sweet and roasty, and also a bit estery..very nice indeed. This is what a porter should look like: darkest brown with a creamy wheat-hued head that coats the glass as it is drawn down. The flavor is rich and complex: mellow roastiness introduces itself, followed by a bloom of flavors ranging from a modest fruity tang to subtle sweet caramel to the mild/dry hop/coffee finish. This brew is smooth and has a fine creamy feel to it--substantial body as well, but not ""heavy."" This is an outstanding example of the brewer's art in evidence: complex, well-balanced, attractive to behold...Mike Hale's dedicated team impresses once again..."
Hale's Celebration Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Hale's Ales;lucky for me that I have a friend who drives down here from their hometown about 3 or 4 times a year. He just last week brought me a case of hales ales, a mixed bag, Now I have sampled them all. Dark and rich, nice nose and a great semisweet finish.

Hale's India Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Hale's Ales;Comments Cloudy light amber with good lace. Long citrus hop finish. Underhopped for IPA
Hale's India Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Hale's Ales;Brass appearance with a creamy head which yielded to an initially creamy mouthfeel. The hops in this beer are quite reserved for a Northwest IPA. A decent introduction to the style--the hops never get out of hand. Well balanced and a good beer to have in your hand--just not an exceptional or unique offering.
Hale's India Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Hale's Ales;The head on my Imperial pint of this stuff was a bit thin--otherwise, this is an outstanding offering. Aroma is fruity/floral/hoppy and with plenty of it. As for flavor, malt comes through nicely to balance very prominent hop profile--excellent bitterness without strident harshness. Finishes pleasantly dry with subtle fruity accompaniment...as fine an IPA as will be found in the Northwest.
Hale's India Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Hale's Ales;The best English (style) IPA I've ever had. Toasty, fruity flavors (Hale's house character) are married perfectly with an understated, but very bitter, hoppiness. The thinking man's India Pale Ale. This might actually be better than the phenomenal pale ale. Brewer Mike Hale might just be God incarnate.
Hale's India Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Hale's Ales;A relatively underrated beer (and brewery for that matter) by afficionados, but I think this is a wonderfully aromatic and easy going West Coast IPA, well worth seeking out, especially on cask.
Hale's Amber Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;Very good beer. Nice smooth taste and finish. Decent head too. Nutty flavor was enjoyable and clean.

Hale's Amber Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;Bottle. Multiple tastings (Previous tastings from memory). Drank these occasionaly when I lived in Seattle. Godd but nothing spectacular.
Hale's Amber Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;It smells good but has a bitter taste that makes you want to set it aside quickly.
Hale's Amber Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;I really like this beer. Great hop and malt flavors and a nice head give this a higher score in my book. Nice deep color and pleasent aroma. Taste is rich and long lasting. Lace is good all the way to the bottom of glass
Hale's Amber Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;Bottle Pours a deep mahogany that is hazy and with a snall light tan head that dissipates quickly. Mellow toasted grain aromas that is malty and only faintly of hops. Flavors are similay somewhat sweet malts with a little toasted slant and still quite easy on bittering hops. Fairly soft carbonation and a woody chalky trailer.
Hale's Amber Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;"Yes, this one is amber in color with an off white head that soon disappears. Caramel and malt aroma. The commercial description claims ""a big malt body"". It's anything but big. Yes malt flavors with a slight crispy/fizzy feel lurking in the background. However also found it to be quite watery and weak bodied. Drinkable but not very exciting."
Hale's Amber Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;"Probably the crispest amber I've ever had. Don't get me wrong, this is noticeably malty and definitely packs the trademark amber-ness but the ""various hop influences"" are very noticeable. I'm not bitching either, I thought this was a very nice aspect to the beer, which overall is very bready and caramelly, except for the hops keeping it in check.

For a light beer, not bad among its peers. But it’s still a light beer.

True North Light;Vaughan, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Magnotta Brewery;Draft.

True North Cream Ale;Vaughan, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Magnotta Brewery;Pale straw coloured pour. The aroma is of pale malt, light corn and a touch of leafy/spicy hops. Surprised to see it listed as all-malt but maybe they were going for the DMS that adds that component. Medium-bodied and a little bit more hoppy than I was expecting which adds a bit of interest to it. Soft lingering bitterness. It’s not great but it’s not terrible either.

Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big lightly tart/tangy raspberry jam, fruit skin/seeds, peach, plum, strawberry, lemon, red apple, hay, straw, grass, oak, candi sugar, lightly toasted bread, light musty funk, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of raspberries, fruity/light funk yeast, oak, candi sugar, and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart/tangy raspberry jam, fruit skin/seeds, peach, plum, strawberry, lemon, red apple, hay, straw, grass, oak, candi sugar, lightly toasted bread, light musty funk, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light fruity/lactic tartness, fruit tang, and yeast/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tart/tangy raspberry jam, fruit skin/seeds, peach, plum, strawberry, lemon, red apple, hay, straw, grass, oak, candi sugar, lightly toasted bread, light musty funk, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of raspberries, fruity/light funk yeast, oak, candi sugar, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/tartness balance, and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from fruit tang/tartness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly slick/syrupy/acidic/tangy/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is an awesome sweetened fruit lambic! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of raspberries, fruity/light funk yeast, oak, candi sugar, and pale malt flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink with the mellowly tart/tangy/drying finish. Super jammy fruit with great yeast complexity; balanced sweetness with nice oak presence. A really enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."

Molson OV Old Vienna;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);473ml can. Clear pale gold, effervescent and a thin foamy white head.

Molson OV Old Vienna;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pale straw with a white head. Nose of corn and industrial malts. There's a fairly pronounced green apple and metallic aroma. Slightly sweet again with a lot of metallic flavour. This is not a good beer.
Molson OV Old Vienna;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Quite possibly the best beer you can buy for the price if your main objective is to get pissed with out shitting your pants. Smells looks and tastes like heaven. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Molson OV Old Vienna;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Okay OV is pretty simple stuff. smoother than Budwesier, kind of crisp, not too much. The least pretentious of the Molson line. It doesn’t try to be what it isn’t and it good at that. They used to sponsor five pin bowling, and is currently about as common.
Molson OV Old Vienna;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottled. The body is clear with an uneven white head. The aroma is like corn, the taste is surprisingly hoppy.
Molson OV Old Vienna;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Old Vienna is listed as a pale lager with the ingredients being only water, barley malt, hops, and yeast. It has a thin, white head, a clear, bubbly, golden straw appearance, with some bits of lacing left behind. The aroma is of sweet malt, white bread, and clean water. Taste is the same, with a mild, rounding hop bite at the end. Mouthfeel is high-light, and Old Vienna finishes crisp, refreshing, and it seems to be a bit higher quality than others of its ilk. RJT
Molson OV Old Vienna;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);473ml can. Its a shitty pale lager but its somewhat drinkable, does not get as poor as it warms.
Molson OV Old Vienna;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);One of the best Molson products available. It is a light tasting old school lager.
Molson OV Old Vienna;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Suitcase Of Cans - Basic budget brew, tastes better than most in that age bracket
Molson OV Old Vienna;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);341ml brown bottle. Pours out a light yellow colour, crystal clear. White foam settles quickly and leaves some thin lacing. Some grains and bready aromas. Taste has thin bready malts, a little sweetness with a light finishing hop note. Old school swillin’.
Alexander Keiths Light;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle, Halifax NS. Pours pale yellow, gassy froth that disappears quickly. No particular aroma. Tastes of sour-hay, ok with a meal with strong flavours, but not great on its own. Like one of the American lite beers, surprised it has 4% alcohol
Alexander Keiths Light;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);checl out this rar north of the border white whale. at the Hilton Garden just outside the halifax airport with some fish and chips. I would venture to guess most american folk dont know that they dont need to travel all the way to england to eat shitty british food, all they have to do is visit an Canadian Province that is not named Quebec. Any way, this critter pours light straw yellow, minimal head, translucent. Light pale malt, balanced sweetness, thin body, abrupt finish. Nothing much to this one.
Alexander Keiths Light;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Pale golden pour with very little head. Weak scent, watery and a touch grassy. Easy to drink. Watery with very little taste. A touch of bitterness and hops. Pretty much goes down like nothing. It’s all in the aftertaste. The aftertaste really reminds me of regular Keith’s IPA. It’s like drinking a slightly beer tasting glass of water then getting the aftertaste like you just downed some Keith’s IPA. Odd. I would probably enjoy it more if I enjoyed Keith’s IPA more. For a light beer it’s very drinkable and better then most.
Alexander Keiths Light;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Draft in a sampler at the Red Stag Tavern. Pours a pale yellow color with a small white head that leaves some lace in the glass. Faint aroma. Very dry. Corn, pale malts, paper, and a hint of citrus. Light-bodied, with medium-high carbonation. Boring.
Alexander Keiths Light;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Draft at Saint John Ale House. Some sweetness and maltiness from the ale come through, but not really a blonde ale much like Keith’s IPA isn’t really an IPA either. Still, being kind of a blonde ale made it better than the majority of light macro lagers. If you have to drink a light beer in Atlantic Canada you could do much worse.
Alexander Keiths Light;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);light yellow color with average head. light wheat nose with not much else going on. Taste is way watery and it tastes exactly like other light macros. Exactly what I expected
Alexander Keiths Light;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Bouteille 341 ml. 4%. Couleur jaune pâle, mousse blanche. Arôme discrets. En bouche, une light macro typique, pas trop de gout, pas d’amertume.
Alexander Keiths Light;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Draught. Pours light yellow with average white head. Weak aromas of grassy hops and malts. Taste is similar and weak/watery. It’s about what you would expect from a light beer. On par with other macro light beers.
Alexander Keiths Light;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle: Poured a super light yellow color lager with a small bubbly head with no retention. Aroma of lightly sweet malt with typical adjunct notes. Taste is also dominated by lightly sweet adjunct and not much else. Body is extremely light with not much else noticeable. Bad boring and bland like most other light beer.
Alexander Keiths Light;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alexander Keith's Nova Scotia Brewery / Oland Brewery (AB InBev);Pours a very pale wellow color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Smells skunky with a tiny bit of spice in the aroma. Tastes light and crisp wwith the skunkyness present in the aftertaste. Slightly spicy in the beginning.
H.C. Berger Whistlepin Wheat Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Rated from old notes taken in the late 90s. Lightly fruity, tart, reminded me of the old Celis White brew out of Texas, but more drier, and slightly more bitter. Turned watery at the end, but not bad overall.
H.C. Berger Whistlepin Wheat Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;12oz bottle-A nice tasting American wheat with no overpowering flavors. Not trying to be something it wasn’t.
H.C. Berger Whistlepin Wheat Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Nice full wheat beer with good malt. Not any frills. Very solid if not terribly special beer. Atypical of the style. I guess that is why I like it.
H.C. Berger Whistlepin Wheat Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Soft, sweet, and caramely. Finishes light, although a little cloying. You'll have to add your own lemon wedge too - no lemon, orange, or coriander was very detectable.
H.C. Berger Indego Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;From old tasting notes. Hazy orange copper color. Big bubbly beige head. Sweet earthy toasted malt aroma. Smooth sweet toasted malt flavor hints at chocolate and brown sugar.ncrisp citrus hop finish.
H.C. Berger Indego Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Had this beer on 1/11/1998. Color is a medium golden brown, head and carbonation are light. Aroma is is a mild malt scent with very little hop fragrance. The taste is a little to sweet and hop flavor and bitterness is not the way it should be for a Pale Ale. It starts off with a sweet malt flavor, goes down smooth and finishes with a mild hop bitterness.
H.C. Berger Indego Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;12oz bottle-A slightly hazy amber with a nice off white head and an aroma of malt and hops. Taste of malt more than hops. Not impressed.

H.C. Berger Indego Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Old notes. Very clean maltiness with a touch of dark fruit in the aroma. Creamy, solid medium body with lots of malt and dark fruit. Aroma also contains a graininess from the use of German malts. A plummy earthiness and a dried biscuit flavor also prevails with an underlying caramel/toffee taste. One of their best beers. I always thought of this one as an Alt beer gone crazy than an American pale.
H.C. Berger Indego Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Completely not what I expected. This one pours a light brown color with a very light creamy head. The aroma is complex and does not smell like a pale and I think this should really be labeled as something else. Flavor is balanced but only slightly, there is a battle going on for flavor dominance in this ale. Creamy and full in the mouthfeel, with a taste that is slightly musty and sweaty sort of like a california common. It is well worth a try though if you can find it. I happened to find this one while driving across Wyoming of all places.
H.C. Berger Indego Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;malty aroma. sun-like brown appearance, translucent. tastes really good, sweet malty with pretty (floral) hops and such. feels good, creamy, full, but a bit dry in the end. overall, very good, but nothing too great. reminded me of a maltier , sweeter anchor steam that seemed to be alot more full. well, that's strange.
H.C. Berger Indego Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Dark golden color. Malty aroma. Malts are ever present on the palate and in the aftertaste. Different from an American pale.
H.C. Berger Indego Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Poured an red-tan body with a white head. Some lacing. Lots of hops in the nose. Some sweetness in the nose too. Nice balance between the malt and hop. The maltiness is a little more pronounced than the hops even. This beer really works just from the balance. A bit fizzy on the mouth though.
H.C. Berger Indego Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;3/30/03: bottle. orange-red color. sour apple taste. not what i’m used to in an american pale ale. darker color than expected. no lacing noted.
H.C. Berger Chocolate Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;From old tasting notes. Opaque black color. Small creamy beige head. Rich smoky malt aroma. Creamy sweet roasted malt flavor. Nice underlying smokiness. Big chewy malty stout.
H.C. Berger Chocolate Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;I know this brewery is discontinued, but I feel I should pay some respects. From memory I always liked this beer. Of course I was in my early 20s and new to the craft beer idea. These guys were one of my first introductions. NOTE: I am rating the average as not to affect the overall percentile.
H.C. Berger Chocolate Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;12oz bottle-A black body with a tan head and an aroma of chocolate. Taste of the same with the chocolate being very prominent. Good tasting stout. I miss this brewery.

H.C. Berger Chocolate Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;"Old notes. Dark, tan head that thins quickly; opaque black/brown color. Intense chocolate aroma with a touch of dryness and some hazelnuts. A slightly sour chocolately, sweet character (probably from too low a pH). Finishes sweet with a slight roast character. More of a porter than a stout."
H.C. Berger Chocolate Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;How did you find this one Shag? It wasnt bad but the bottle was probably old. It was chocolatey more than anything. A bit watery but not bad at all. RIP.
H.C. Berger Chocolate Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;How I managed to stumble across this is beyond me. But low and behold there was a lonely 6 pack sitting on the shelf. The beer poured like motor oil. Dark black appearance with a small tan head. Aroma is roasted malts and chocolate. Its slighty bitter with a heavy chocolate taste. Some sourness is present in the aftertaste. Not a bad stout at all.
H.C. Berger Chocolate Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Dark as night color. Minimal head. Malty aroma. Rich chocolate flavor with hints of caramel. Soft on the palate, not much texture from a stout. Very drinkable though.
H.C. Berger Chocolate Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Black beer with a thin, oily film on top. Strong roasted nose with big hints of vinegar. Dark bitter chocolate tastes but also burnt caramel sweetness. Decent, but disjointed. And now its gone.
H.C. Berger Chocolate Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Nice deep dark choolate syrup/motor oil pour. Fresh, molasses, pruney like aroma, bit of chocolate to sweeten it up. Thick, dark pour with a caramel color head and a fair amount of lacing. Excellent stout flvaor - hint of bittersweet chocolate and burnt coffee. Flavor does not let up throughout the entire 12 oz - does not sour or bitter up. Overall - an excellent stout! Thanks Aurelius for this one.
H.C. Berger Red Raspberry Wheat Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Had this beer on 2/8/1998. Color is a burnt orange, average carbonation and very little head. Aroma has the scent of fresh raspberries. Taste is light and refreshing with good tones of raspberries coming though. It starts off with a light crisp body, going down smooth and clean. Finish is a nice raspberry with a light bitterness that balances things off well. This is a great summer beer it goes down smooth and would really quench your thirst on a hot day.
H.C. Berger Red Raspberry Wheat Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;12oz bottle-One of the first flavored wheat I ever tried. It was a nice balance between the flavors and was not overpowering in the fruit aspect.
H.C. Berger Red Raspberry Wheat Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Nice balanced raspberry beer. Not terribly fruity, good flavor though. Nice aroma of berries and malt. Nice beer.
H.C. Berger Red Raspberry Wheat Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Hmm, as far as Raspberry Wheat beers go, this one is about my favorite so far. Nicely balanced with the sweetness and bitterness. Definitely fruit beer, but not overwhelmingly so. It’s not Leinie’s Berry Weiss, in other words.
Angelic Shakedown Brown;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Dark Brown Coloring. Hard to Detect Aroma as it Was a Smokey Joint, But Tasted Nuts so It Was Probably in the Aroma as Well. Malty. Very Decent Brew.
Angelic Shakedown Brown;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Dark brown color with a thin head. Slight nut aroma. Pretty rich malt flavor and solid nut presence as well. Some chocolate as well. Good example of a brown.
Angelic Shakedown Brown;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Dark brown body. Soda-shop malt flavor with notes of dark chocolate, brown sugar and leafy hops. Chocolate-malt aroma. I liked this chocolately rendition of a brown.
Angelic Shakedown Brown;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Little aroma but a nutty taste. Very sweet & malty but unbalanced, even for the style.
Angelic Shakedown Brown;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;"Nice dark brown color with fl;oral aromas. Unlike most browns not too sweet. Very nice. Love the name."

Angelic Shakedown Brown;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Chestnut color with a light tan head. Caramel nose with slight undertone of herbal hops. Flavors towards the caramel/toffee malt side with just a bit of hops to balance. An average brown.
Angelic Shakedown Brown;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Initially very crisp but flavor quickly dissapates to nothing. Beautiful amber (not brown by far) hue, not nutty at all. Thin.
Angelic Shakedown Brown;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;Dark ruby brown in color. Very smooth and rich, with an average nutiness. Very fresh, dry finish. Nice complexity but slightly lacking in omph.
Angelic Shakedown Brown;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Angelic Brewing Company;This brewery offers mediocre beers at best. This brown was okay, sweet and an appropriate hop balance. It didn''t encourage us to stick around for more however.
Angelic Arch Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Angelic Brewing Company;Cloudy Light Orange Coloring with Light Tan Head. Hoppy Aroma.. Wet Hops..Sweet and Bitter Taste... Nice and Subtle.
Angelic Arch Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Angelic Brewing Company;Murky amber color with a thin head. Slightly floral aroma. Taste of fresh grains with some extreme bitterness, but lacking the floral hops which I found to be nice. Very fine amber.
Angelic Arch Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Angelic Brewing Company;"The old Believers Bitter. I found out the name was changed because a consultant was hired and indicated that people did not want a ""bitter"" beer. THey indicated that sales have increase significantly since. For a city that prides itself on policital correctness and intelligentsia, you have to love the naivete. Copper color with a light cream colored head. Light fruit and citrus nose. Caramel, earthy malt and light fruit. A decent brew and now that it is an amber, better than most."
Angelic Arch Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Angelic Brewing Company;Sampled at Angelic brewery. Wonderful, hoppy, caramelly aroma, smooth. Nice red color. Small, off-white head. Nice flavor. Impressive.
Angelic Arch Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Angelic Brewing Company;Clear copper body with small off-white head. Aroma is floral and medium sweet (peach). Taste is minimally sweet, peach, earthy/floral, finishing decent earthy bitter. Medium body.
Angelic Arch Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Angelic Brewing Company;Medium brown color, with a slightly nutty scent. This would have been a fine beer if it was their brown ale, which it wasn't. This tasted a lot like Newcastle. Not a bad beer, but not great, and certainly not to style.
Angelic Arch Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Angelic Brewing Company;"I tried this beer at a ""no crap on tap"" block party fundraiser for a local independent radio station (5/18/03). I really enjoyed the beer and detected none of the negative tastes others experienced in the posts below. To me, the beer tasted like a nicely-hopped pale ale with a somewhat fuller & maltier body. Very nice in my estimation."
Angelic Arch Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Angelic Brewing Company;Nice bitterness, although slightly off balance. Medicinal. Somewhat of a dry, toasty finish.
Angelic Arch Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Angelic Brewing Company;Something went wrong with this beer. It should have never made it to the taps. Very medicinal flavor and distorted tastes. Ugh! My girlfriend made the mistake of buying a pint and felt sick all night after drinking it. Bad batch or bad recipe? Who knows? I just know this one sucked!
Angelic Arch Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Angelic Brewing Company;This beer looked OK in the glass--a rather standard deep copper with minimal head. Hops were revealed in the nose and provided a welcoming floral fragrance. So far so good.... I lifted and drank and then quickly considered spitting it out as if this was wine tasting. This beer was horribly medicinal. The taste had an almost antiseptic character. The aftertaste offered no escape as the strong doctor's office feeling came along for the swallow. Nasty!
Angelic Harvest Moon Hefe-Weizen;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Angelic Brewing Company;Stopped by Angelic, and this was the only one of their beers they had on tap. Apparently they are moving their operations off site so they can bottle their beer (YAY). One of the better Hefe’s I’ve had in a while. Made me smile.
Angelic Harvest Moon Hefe-Weizen;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Angelic Brewing Company;Yellow-orange and very cloudy with a thin, and creamy white head. Very light aroma with some tiny hints of banana. Nice sweet wheaty flavor with some banana and a hint of clove spiciness. A hint of grassy hop flavor comes out in the finish, but only if you pay real close attention. Dry with good carbination. Not too complex but not bad.
Angelic Harvest Moon Hefe-Weizen;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Angelic Brewing Company;"Cloudy yellow, medium head; lowish carbonation, fairly malty though not all that sweet; faint banana/lemon notes throughout. Finish rather dull."
Hitorimusume (Only Daughter) Sayaka Junmai Sake;IBARAKA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Yamanaka Shuzo Co., Ltd.;This 09-05 bottled Sake from a bottle shop poured a head of no head clear colored bubbles that were and left behind a uncarbonated . The mild aroma was polished rice. The mouth feel was tingly at the start with a mediumly tingly finish with a soft dry aftertaste. The mild flavor contained notes of mild nail polish vinous and semi-sweet. It has a very mild alcohol burn to it. An OK Sake typical and nothing special.
Hitorimusume (Only Daughter) Sayaka Junmai Sake;IBARAKA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Yamanaka Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottled. Clear and very pale golden. Yeasty rice-aroma. Stale. Flavour from yeast with stron alcohol. Oily palate.

Hitorimusume (Only Daughter) Sayaka Junmai Sake;IBARAKA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Yamanaka Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Honestly, I have no idea how to rate this. Bottle. Totally clear, no head at all. Potato and rice aroma, with alcohol. Some apples in flavor, but most of all alcohol, rice and potato peels. I have no idea how this is supposed to be, and I dont feel like trying many sakes after this...
Hitorimusume (Only Daughter) Sayaka Junmai Sake;IBARAKA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Yamanaka Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottle. Aroma is rice, wet cardboard. Flavour is rice, alcohol, mild, wet card board. Weird taste but still drinkable.
Hitorimusume (Only Daughter) Sayaka Junmai Sake;IBARAKA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Yamanaka Shuzo Co., Ltd.;"Bottle. My second time ever to taste sake. This is really not enough experience to rate this, but you got to start somewhere. The body is pale and clear, I really can’t see anything wrong with this, but believe I should try to follow the more experienced rater and go for the more average 3-point appearance. The aroma is strong; the first impression really reminds me about a bad moonshine experiment from the deep, dark woods of Norway. A little more detailed analysis of this is a distinctive alcohol flavor, alcohol with fusel. It could also give a feeling of sweet overcooked rice and old, wet, moldy newspapers. Flavor gives much the same impression as the aroma. Not a very pleasant experience but interesting. I really don’t know what you are expected to eat together with this, but we tried with some salmon, and the sake actually tasted better. Have to sample some other sakes later, particularly together with someone more experienced."
Hitorimusume (Only Daughter) Sayaka Junmai Sake;IBARAKA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Yamanaka Shuzo Co., Ltd.;300 ml bottle. Crystal clear. Aroma of pears, melon, light yeastiness and some sweet tapioca. A hint of soft spice and perfumey floral notes. Heathery sweetness. Soft texture with pear, melon and pepper flavour. Lightly alcoholic but still balanced and smooth. Tapioca and fruit with an aromatic light fruitiness.
Hitorimusume (Only Daughter) Sayaka Junmai Sake;IBARAKA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Yamanaka Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottled. I am not a sake fan, but when I got the opportunity to taste this one, I had to give it a try. Aroma is sweet, with notes that reminds me of cold, overcooked rice, and wet cardboard. It is clear, and with a yellowish color. Flavour has alcohol, rice and some hints of fruit. Should probably taste more sakes and really get to like it before starting to rate them... (051022)
Hitorimusume (Only Daughter) Sayaka Junmai Sake;IBARAKA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Yamanaka Shuzo Co., Ltd.;"Very light; sweet aroma. Slight alcohol scent. Not much taste at first and the alcohol is a little overpowering, though the alcohol bite does not linger long like other mid-qualityJunmais. Must be rolled in mouth for a while before the subtle apple/pear flavors appear. Not a bad drink, have had much worse."

MacTarnahans Bobby Dazzler Holiday Ale;Portland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Really old bottle from Liquid Solutions. Used to drink this years ago. Bet it has stayed well. Pours clear, dark, ruddy copper with a decent foamy tan head. Aroma is of really dark fruits. It has changed. Medium body with very mild carbonation. Flavor is chalky, bitter evergreen, muddy malt. Turns up a chocolate note. Love drinking this old stuff. I think this is 8 years in the bottle. Held up well. Especially for 6.5. They should revisit the recipe and revamp it into IS. This will never get there, but it has taken the first step.
MacTarnahans Bobby Dazzler Holiday Ale;Portland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Blast from the past here.

Pours a dark copper red, very clear, with a white head. Aroma is very strong and sweet, just like a well aged barleywine, big caramel malts, brown sugar. Taste was a big letdown though, very thin body with much less sweetness. There was a bit of oxidation in the finish and some faint spicing. I think this brew is a bit past its prime.

MacTarnahans Uncle Ottos Oktoberfest;Portland, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);MacTarnhan(Portland) Brewing is long standing, respected mico, that has produced rock solid beers over the years. Uncle Otto’s is a fantastic domestic example of marzen/Oktoberfest beer, that had me crying for more. The beer is brewed with six different malts, an authentic lager strain, hopped with Mt. Hood and Saaz hops, then cold lagered for a full two months. This makes for a very authentic, very malty, hearty, delicious beer. Uncle Otto’s Oktoberfest pours to a beautiful, deep amber to chestnut color with a thick and creamy white head and a good bit of carbonation. The nose on this beer is wonderfully malty and aromatic with big sweet malty and nutty aromas balanced with some herbal hop aromas. The palate is full and soft on the tongue with lots of big nutty, sweet malty, and toasty malt flavors that glide over the tongue on a smooth, round, body. This beer is so hearty and flavorful but just so drinkable. Uncle Otto’s finishes with more big nutty/malty flavors up front, then ends with some vibrant herbal/grassy hop bitterness to balance out the sweet malty flavors of this beer. This hearty beer is the perfect match with hearty dishes, from stews, to roasts, to brats, take your pick.
MacTarnahans Uncle Ottos Oktoberfest;Portland, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);pours a dark amber color. Aromas of rich caramel, nuts, and hops. Flavors of toffee, fruit, and a finish of subtle hops.

The flavor is slightly warm and smooth, with malt dominant and negligible hops. Some raisiney esters in the flavor. Mouthfeel is full and soft, with moderate carbonation. Terrific beer for a cold day -- to make your beer-loving friends’ eyes pop (and release more of the malty aromas and some of the fruity esters in this lovely beer, pop it in the microwave for five to fifteen seconds and drink it slightly warmed.

MacTarnahans Uncle Ottos Oktoberfest;Portland, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"This beer is bipolar. It starts out a little tart and seems to like that, but suddenly switches to sweet. Normally this would be no big deal; plenty of beers do this. But given that it is an Oktoberfest, this puzzles me somewhat. I guess that’s what you get for let a Scot brew a German spezialty."

Body is nice but perhaps a touch light for the style. Alcohol presence in the flavour. Nice roasted malt finish.
MacTarnahans Uncle Ottos Oktoberfest;Portland, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);I’m assuming that this bottle was old - I just got it last week (in July) - because it was pretty bad, bordering on horrible. I was looking forward to trying it because I really like this style of beer, but I was very disappointed. I hope it was just an old, stale bottle and not the true flavor of the beer.

Beck's Oktoberfest;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Best before 6/09...sampled on 8/10/10....but wth, it's only fitty cents! Got on clearance sale at my local retailer, so grabbed bunch of lighter stuff for filler. Hadn't tried this yet, so wanted to know what I'm getting into before buying a 12 pack this fall. I think I like Sammy's Oktoberfest better, but this is ok. Nothing special really, but good economy beer. Will probably have to try fresh to validate this.
Beck's Oktoberfest;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Not the best Oktoberfest, actually one of the weaker German Oktoberfest I’ve had. Thin and a little watery. Biscuit, Carmel, a little lemon zing at the end. Tried for the first time in 2009.
Beck's Oktoberfest;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;From Sep 2007 Purchased at Albertson's for US$7.00 a 6 Pack. Pours from 12oz bottle a clear amber gold with a small head of foam that shrinks quickly and leaves a fine broken layer with a bit of lacing. The smell is of roasted malt, biscuit, and a touch of citrus. The taste is pretty bitter up front and it has some notes of biscuit and roasted malt but again, this is a pretty bitter taster for the style. It finishes dry with a short aftertaste and it's a medium mouthfeel with medium-high carbo. First time I've seen this one in many moons and I find it pretty average as a beer and below average for the style. 1 6'er will do it for me.
Beck's Oktoberfest;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;This is my all time favorite Octoberfest beer. You can just taste all the different spices throughout but yet its a smooth tasting beer. I look forward to this coming out each and every year

Beck's Oktoberfest;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;12 oz bottle poured. Saw this bottle, and just had to have it. Copper pour with a lasting foam head. Pretty skunky aroma, straw from quite a distance. Flavor seems to be similar to the regular Becks product, only sweeter. Some caramel addition. A bit of a spicy malt if you sit here, concentrate, and really think about it. Overall, extremely odd, but not discouraging. Drinkable. My biggest regret: not saving this for a larger tasting. Sorry, Mcberko.
Beck's Oktoberfest;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;Bottle in Seattle. Thanks Andrew. A Lutton tick if there ever was one! Modest foam, very clear amber Vienna lager. Rotting vegetable aroma. Sweet, disgusting odd malty character. Egg, fermented rotten veg, odd fruitiness. Bright carbonation, at least. Bitter cocoa. Rather disgusting, an insult to the style. Pretty darn similar to the regular becks with a touch of added fruit and disgustingness. Nein, danke.
Beck's Oktoberfest;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;330ml bottle from a Lider supermaket in Providencia. Santiago, Nov. 2016. Pours a clear bright reddish color with a small fizzy white head that diminishes slowly leaving a thin film. Aroma is malty, with a good solid profile showing notes of biscuit, bread, caramel and some fruity touches. Slight hints of apple and pear. Quite good. Taste is light, not overblowing, but solid. Mostly sweet, biscuity, with good bitter balance from (probably) Saaz hops. Herbal and apple touches near the finish. Light to medium body. Highly drinkable. I drank gallons of these in the last few days when meeting some friends. Great when in the mood for a simple, straight-forward lager with character.
Beck's Oktoberfest;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;354 ml bottle. Bought in a Lider supermarket in Santiago.

Sea Dog (Old East) India Pale Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;IPA;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);"After reading a bunch of negative reviews, I am thinking that Seadog took out the ""Old East"", and just calls this ""IPA"" now. I couldn't find anything labeled just IPA, so am reviewing it here....saw a few on ratebeer.com did the same, as there is no straight IPA listed there. The bottle just says ""IPA"" and the label is a little different...but it has to be the same. I did notice the aroma to be off, like wet/old dog. Even before reading the reviews, I said ""This is not an IPA"". More like a off balanced-pale or extra at best.....not quite a copper. Not much citrus...just did not work for me. Was not horrible, I'd say is still drinkable. Just does not seem to live up to what it represents."

Sea Dog Riverdriver Hazelnut Porter;Topsham, Maine, United States;Porter;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Worth the try, but nothing really special here. Tasted like possibly some vanilla in there...not as hazelnutty as I thought it would be, which is OK cause I'm not a big fan of overwhelming hazel. A thinner porter, more on the medium-dark brown side versus near black appearance. Pretty much an average overall beer.

H.C. Berger Red Banshee Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Had this beer on 2/11/1998. Color is a deep rich red, good carbonation and nice head. Aroma is a mild scent of toasted malts, no noticeable hops. Taste is a heavy but smooth flavor, it stares off with a creamy body full of roasted malt flavors. Goes down well and finishes buy leaving you with a nutty malt taste and a slight hop bitterness. Its a very well rounded beer with rich flavors all the way around. This would be a good beer any time you’re in the mood for a nice full flavored beer.
H.C. Berger Red Banshee Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;12oz bottle- A medium amber body with a good head and an aroma of malts and slight hops. Taste of the same with a little more hops than malt.

H.C. Berger Red Banshee Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Yes, I have found some old notes. Rudy copper color with a moderate off-white head. Simple caramel aromas along with a touch of raisins and floral hops. Flavors follow aromas in simplicity, but things are a touch dryer than the fruit and caramel suggest. A bit like dry toast.
H.C. Berger Red Banshee Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Oh, come on! This is beyond doubt the worst beer I’ve ever tasted. It’s filth. The stench alone is enough to turn most stomachs.
H.C. Berger Red Banshee Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Reddish brown with a very thin head. Nose is slightly vinous, slightly sour with a hint of toffee. Flavor is earthy and slightly medicinal. Not one of my favorites.
H.C. Berger Red Banshee Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Very strong hops in the nose and the sip. Very overpowering. Not very appealing, not my style admittedly. Good appearance and mouthfeel. Just too hoppy for me.
H.C. Berger Red Banshee Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Ruby red in color with a thin head. More malt than hops in the aroma. Reminds me of Killians red, the Coors version. Not bad if you like the style.
H.C. Berger Kolsch;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Picked this up at random at the local shop where it occupied the back of a shelf. Decent reddish color with a thin head. Flavor is a bland malt feel with somewhat strong crispness. Could be better, but it could be fresher.
H.C. Berger Kolsch;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;A good, easy to drink intro to the style. Good clean hops with the expected fruit finish.
H.C. Berger Kolsch;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;This beer has a nice citrus flavor the right amount bitterness. A tad too sweat.
H.C. Berger Bombay Express Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Had this beer on 7/24/2000. Aroma is a lightly sour malt scent. Color is a pale gold with light carbonation and head. Taste is like a piece of burnt bark. Starting with a medium body it goes down sharp. Finish is BAD, it comes on with a taste that is like burnt malt ground up with stale wood. Overall this may be one of the worst beers I’ve ever had and is definitely the worst beer H.C. has ever made. I just don’t know what they where thinking.
H.C. Berger Bombay Express Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Bottle from Party Town, KY. Poured amber color with a moderate white head that diminished slowly with good lacing. Moderate sweet malty aroma. Medium body with a sticky texture. Heavy sweet flavor with a sweet finish of average duration. This did not meet my expectations.
H.C. Berger Bombay Express Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Old notes. Light in body, crisp but insipable when cold, as it warms its drinkability increases and the finish weighs in with a complex caramel maltiness. Light, but rich red in color. Very little bitterness.
H.C. Berger Bombay Express Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Poured red amber with no head or lacing. Aroma and flavor of malt made this beer too sweet for me. Drainpour.

H.C. Berger Bombay Express Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;This is better than any Indian beer I have had. A fine example of a English pub ale. Very malty, some sediment, on the whole a very drinkable beer.
H.C. Berger Bombay Express Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Could use a large blast of hops to even things out. Very malty. Not sure what the India connection is but nothing like anything Indian I''ve ever had IMHO. I enjoyed it but probably won''t look for it again.
H.C. Berger Bombay Express Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Golden-yellow colour. Caramel malt aroma. Caramel malt flavour with just a hint of spicy hop flavour right before the sweet finish. Reminds me of Redhooks ESB.
H.C. Berger Bombay Express Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;All malt nose. Hazy tea colored brew with cool label, and griffin & barley emblem. Dinging it for the twistoff. Thin palate. Malty brew with a tea-herbal aftertaste. Not very balanced, but OK and a little different.
H.C. Berger Dopplebock;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Malty, flavorful without a strong alcohol presence. Only had once, and it is not longer produced.
H.C. Berger Dopplebock;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;"(Note, this IS actually spelled with the ""l"" before the ""e"" in ""Dopplebock"" on the label.) Upon opening the bottle and pouring, I get an outstanding Doppelbock aroma, with strong hints of chocolate and some kind of coffee (mocha, maybe; I'm not sure as I'm not a coffee drinker). Probably all kinds of other scents that, as a relative novice, I can't quite distinguish. I could be pleased just by taking repeated whiffs of that wonderful aroma. Dark, dark liquid, nearly black & opaque. Virtually no head to speak of, though. The first sipping starts out with strong mouthfeel and gives way to a rather thin, mild taste, and something of a lackluster, flat, underwhelming, stale finish (but still get the smooth, sweet taste of chocolate on the finish). The chocolate is really quite prominent throughout. Note quite as impressive in the taste and palate (rather disappointing, actually) as in that wonderful, inviting AROMA. Overall, this one is hard to really like. The flat taste, mouthfeel, palate and finish, despite the nice chocolate overtones, is going to make this one hard to come back to. It's simply hard to drink, like a flat/stale soda-pop. It does not help in the slightest that this costs $4 a 16.9 oz. (500 ml) bottle sitting in a store a 45-minute drive away. The aroma is about all it has going for it. Despite my liking for doppelbock styles, this falls into the middle of the pack among the 7 doppelbocks I've tried so far. I really wish that this hard more of a sharp character to it, because if it did, it could be first-rate."
H.C. Berger Dopplebock;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Aroma of malt, caramel, molasses, some coffee, alcohol, nuts. Completely vanishing head on a nice brown-black liquid. Medium to full body, cloyingly sweet, sticky, very little dryness at all. Flavors of molasses, maple syrup, malt, raisins. This is too sweet, somewhat unbalanced (for once I think an American beer is a bit is too light on the hops, bet you thought THAT would never happen). No off flavors and pretty nice aroma, but too much like drinking syrup.
H.C. Berger Rauchbier;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;MUDDY BOG LIKE BROWN COLORING, VERY TASTY WITH HINTS OF SMOKE LACED THROUGHOUT.VERY POWERFUL ALE THAT KICKED MY ASS GOOD! TOO BAD I ONLY HAD ONE DAMN BIG BOTTLE OF IT!

Weeping Radish Corolla Gold Helles Lager;Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;22oz Bottle. The pour was a clear golden yellow with an average (1-2 finger) white frothy head that quickly diminished, down to a light wispy film and small collar with fair spotty lacing. The aroma was very mild with a light biscuit malt, some grassy hops and a dusty yeast with hints of caramel, adjuncts (corn I believe) and a slight grainy appeal. The taste was lightly malty with a touch of caramel early on, and then became mildly bitter and grainy with a mild adjunct finish. The flavor lasted only a short while proceeding the swallow, with a slightly bitter grainy taste left behind. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a medium carbonation. Overall I found this brew to be just OK, it was refreshing but really did not have a lot of flavor. This is a good brew when doing yard work on a hot Summers day when you’re looking for something more than just to quench your thirst... www.facebook.com/KAJIIsBeerReviews

Weeping Radish Corolla Gold Helles Lager;Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;Bottle. I’m pretty confused by this beer since it might have suffered from some quality control issues, but it’s still not all that bad bc of its tart nature. Clear gold hue with a thin white head. Some sweet crackery malts, grass and a hay sourness. Flavor is quite sour, tart, hay and slight sweet malt in the end. Weird

Weeping Radish Fest Amber Lager;Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;Rated from old notes. Hoppy and toasted taste. Unchallenging and has the makings of a failure, but comes back around and settles into a drinkable if unglamorous beer.

Pours a nice amber/ orange color- white head disappates immediately. Light and refreshing on the palate- feels like a amber summer beer. Lots of sweetness from the malts- not much hoppiness or finsih to it. Pretty inoffensive- interesting that all the lighter beer drinkers in the crowd chose this from the tap list.

Sweet flavour of toasted bready malt, caramel and light nuts with a dry, mild bitter finish. Light body with a thin, watery texture and soft carbonation. A malt forward Amber that could use some more hops. Ok, for a boring style.
Breckenridge Avalanche Amber;Denver, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Draft at the Union Bar, Gering, NE. Drinkable American red ale with low level of bitterness
Breckenridge Avalanche Amber;Denver, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Y'all can fuck off this was a really great beer. Classic amber malt and sticky mouthfeel.
Dixie Blackened Voodoo Lager;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dixie Brewing Co.;Bottle at trailer tasting. Clear cola color with tan foam. Toasted caramel, black malt aromas. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Lightly sweet toasted caramel, herbal, dark bread flavors--- not bad
Dixie Blackened Voodoo Lager;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dixie Brewing Co.;It is in cans now. Dark amber pour, disappearing head. Nose is faint roasted grain. Middle is toasty grain, thin body, light bitterness. Finish is a little bland. Not much has changed
Dixie Blackened Voodoo Lager;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dixie Brewing Co.;Can. Clear amber, beige head. Looks promising. But alas, aroma/taste fails to live up to the appearance. Toasted malt, hints of chocolate, lager, metallic notes. Watery finish.
Dixie Blackened Voodoo Lager;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dixie Brewing Co.;Tap at Todd English in Birmingham Alabama. Aroma has roasted malts and Cascade hops. Pours brown amber body with off-white lacing. Taste is medium bitter with some sweet malts in the finish. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a odd herbal finish. I doubt the Germans would approve.
Dixie Blackened Voodoo Lager;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dixie Brewing Co.;From tap at House of Blues, New Orleans. Aroma is dark malt with caramel, light roast with a touch of chocolate and nuts. Flavour is moderate to medium sweet with a mild roasty biterness. Body modest to medium. A bit better than expected, fairly dull but hardly bad.
Dixie Blackened Voodoo Lager;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dixie Brewing Co.;A hazy, red pour with a tan head. The aroma has plum and black cherry with some caramel. It has a light body with smooth texture and average carbonation. The taste is sweet with a slightly dry finish.
Dixie Blackened Voodoo Lager;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dixie Brewing Co.;"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, and nuttiness; with lighter notes of chocolate, cocoa, herbal, grass, and roast/toasted earthiness. A bit of fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity dark/roast/bready malt and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, and nuttiness; with lighter notes of chocolate, cocoa, herbal, grass, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/grassy hop and roast bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, chocolate, cocoa, herbal, grass, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering hop/roast bitterness. Nicely clean on lager flavors, not too fruity/yeasty. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a nice dark lager. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish Very flavorful for the low ABV. Clean and nicely rich malts, with mild earthy hop balance. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example. Kind of midway between a dunkel and schwarzbier."
Dixie Blackened Voodoo Lager;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dixie Brewing Co.;Got this in a to-go cup on Bourbon Street. A pleasant change from a bland pale lager, but not great or anything.
Dixie Blackened Voodoo Lager;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dixie Brewing Co.;Dixie Blackened Voodoo - Mixed six pack from Mike’s Food Mart, enjoyed at Mayan Import Company on Magazine St. Great place where you can just sit out front smoking and drinking. Even some of the people inside were going next door to get glasses of wine. Love how much New Orleans lets grown ups be grown ups. The atmosphere improves this beer dramatically. If regular Dixie is Lone Star of NO, this is the Shiner Bock, but a bit richer and more deeply and sweetly flavorful. When I first tried this back in 90’s it was one of my favorites ever. Now I’ve been “jaded” by so many incredible brews swished through my mouth it does not blow my mind so much. I’d recommend it to any 18 year old to start their education in flavors, beer history and adulthood in general.

Dixie Blackened Voodoo Lager;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dixie Brewing Co.;Bottle 35,5 cl. Pours a clear, nutty brown with a lacing, beige head. Nose has subtle burned caramel. Medium body, very soft on the palate. Again burned caramel, subdued roast, slightly nutty with a hint of cardboard. There's not an awful lot going on here, but it's a decent little drinker in it's own right. 241117
Blue Moon Belgian White Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can’t believe I didn’t review this famous beer. Review in ewk terminal for aa. Won’t tip the bartender. It’s the worst service I have had.
Blue Moon Belgian White Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This beer scared me from ever drinking blue moon again. It was an alright beer, if it was there I would drink it, but one time drinking Belgium white I took a drink there was a chunk of something in there. I damn near threw up
Blue Moon Belgian White Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);tastes like a belgian white was diluted 50/50 with a coors. sweet smelling cheap wheat and corn with old orange peels or orange flavoring. flavor is the same - sweet brew of cheap wheat and corn with weird orange flavor - not getting nice yeasty funk or spice or anything youd expect from a good white ale. cloying orange flavor and stale grain aftertaste - will avoid...
Blue Moon Belgian White Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Somehow I never got around to rating this one. Seems I've had it many times over the years but never bothered to note it. Well here it is in Cyprus on tap of all places! Has medium cloudy body and modest foam, sharp coriander aroma. Flavour is orange citrus and coriander. Crisp finish. Unique and reliable, must be why it's so ubiquitous.
Blue Moon Belgian White Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Dirty yellow-orange with no head. Smell of wheat and orange peels. Oaty and wheaty taste with an orange candy component, like Fruitella Orange, and a coriander note. Low carbonation. Rather stale this beer.
Blue Moon Belgian White Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);330 ml bottle. Pours hazy yellow with white head. Aroma is coriander, wheat, oranges. Flavor is coriander, wheat, oranges, banan, cloves, citrus.
Blue Moon Belgian White Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle. Hazy orange color. Medium size, off-white head, stays. Sweet, coconut, sugary, honey, wheaty in aroma/taste. Happens.
Blue Moon Belgian White Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Hazy orange pour. Citrus nose. Wheaty, sweet, loads of zest and citrus. Ok white
Blue Moon Belgian White Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Citrusna aroma, poput nekakve pomorandže, pomalo kao mango. Lep izgled, mutno, maglovito. Ukus isto pomalo citrusan, kiselkast poput pomorandže, osjeæa se pœenice. Jako lep osjeæaj u ustima, pecka za nepce pomalo. Odlièan aftertaste. Kupila sam u rodu jer nisam imala para za pljeskavicu, ostavila da se ladi i otišla po pljeskavicu sa novcima za pljeskavicu. Odlièno prelepo iskustvo. Boca 330ml. 7.5
Blue Moon Belgian White Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Nose. Bright, coriander, orange and some white bread. Taste. Dense body, Taste spicy orange, in something pastry shop. The aftertaste is a little astringency from the zest and notes of “spicy oranges”
Blue Moon Raspberry Cream Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);From old tasting notes. Deep Amber orange color. Bubbly beige head. Sweet berry aroma. Tangy fruit malt flavor is balanced by an assertive, crisp malt/hop character.
Blue Moon Raspberry Cream Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Slightly deep copper but clear, under a very thin white cap. Crisp and light aroma that’s got a touch of raspberry fruit, and light lagerish tones. Crisp and semi-light body, blonde lager tones with a kiss of light raspberry fruit. No tartness, just smooth and light and actually a little full bodied from some oats in the brew. But it certainly doesn’t taste like 6%
Blue Moon Raspberry Cream Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Didn’t hold out too much hope for this 12 oz., retired, cellar straggler, but was pleasantly surprised by the quick fizz to the cap removal, nice clarity to the coppery amber color, and modest, but lasting bubbles to the soft white layer of head foam, with light spots of lacing. The aroma even impressed with sweet & fruity, raspberry puree, some cordial character, a bit of tart cranberry and a touch of cookie to lightly soften the nose. The taste, on the other hand, sadly disappointed, with a light body, a sweetened, fruit water nature, only subtle hints of hop astringency & malt, and carbonation that was too low to save the flavor in some palatable degree.
Blue Moon Raspberry Cream Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12oz bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a light pinkish amber with a decent sized head. Aroma of raspberry, wheat, and malt. Taste of a raspberry creamsicle. This light bodied brew is well balanced and not tto shabby.
Blue Moon Raspberry Cream Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Sample on tap at the Jax Beer Fest 2013. The brewer said that it was revived for the festival. Pinkish pour with a decent off-white head. Nice sweet but balanced aroma of raspberries and cream with an actually nice raspberry and cream flavor as well. This is probably one of the better Blue Moon one-offs I’ve had.
Blue Moon Raspberry Cream Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Old beer at home. Pours a reddish orange. Pretty flat at this point. Smells like juice. Kinda one note at this point. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Blue Moon Raspberry Cream Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Creamy pour, fluffy head. Raspberry notes and caramel malt, some faded hops. Flavor is ok, light berries, wheat, caramel.
Blue Moon Raspberry Cream Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle at GABF. Pours a ruddy pinkish ambery looking thing. White head. Nose is raspberry jam, though somewhat subdued. On tasting, more of the creamy raspberry, light tartness. Lots of tannin comes through and an iced tea type note. Pretty interesting beer and not bad.
Blue Moon Raspberry Cream Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I absolutely love this beer. I used to drink it all the time. Now I can’t find it anymore. I’m sure it’s still around. Man I miss this stuff. Great raspberry flavor mixed in with wheat. Nice stuff! Hard to believe it’s actually brewed by Coors. They certainly got this one right!
Blue Moon Raspberry Cream Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This rating is from memory, but i remember i time when i drank plenty of it from the tap at Fitgers Brew House. Like a raspberry cream of wheat.... or something. It was a damn good beer.
Blue Moon Nut Brown Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle poured to pint glass cold beer Appearance: Light yellow, head, a lot of lacing Aroma: scent smell of malt, slight fruity smell nothing else Taste: still ok Mouth feel: carbonated Overall: good beer nothing special just got it to taste it, not to do it again
Blue Moon Nut Brown Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12oz bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a light brown with a small head. Aroma of malt, caramel, nutty, and toffee. Taste of the same with some added sweetness. This medium bodied brew is not a bad brew from Coors.
Blue Moon Nut Brown Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle (2000?)... Found this baby in an old box of golf balls along with a Sam Adams Longshot Hazelnut Brown (1997?) (my favorite beer before before many of my favorites of today were even a gleam in their respective brew masters’ eyes). I used to really like this beer as well, let’s see how it held up... Clear, dark mahogany ale with a small, fizzy, off-white head. Restrained aroma of caramel and toffee with a hint of earthiness and a whisper of milk chocolate. Flavor wise, no real oxidation. Not much else either. Well-balanced, although it leans a touch on the sweet side and is pretty thin. Unoffensive. Light to medium-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Short, crisp, clean finish... too crisp and clean for the style. In this bottle’s case, thank God for pasteurization. Oh well, not as much going on as I remember. Can’t wait to drink the Sam Adams Hazelnut Brown... loved it twelve years ago and probably still will, but I’m certain it’s not in the database. They only brewed it for one year and that was well before RateBeer!

Blue Moon Nut Brown Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle. A very tasty brew indeed! Smooth and very rich. Roasted malt and caramel. Pure joy. Sad that it is no longer brewed.
Blue Moon Nut Brown Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I haven’t had this in about 11 years, but I remember it being somewhat flavorful. It might have gotten a higher rating from me, but I am not a big fan of the style.
Blue Moon Nut Brown Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);The name tells you everything you need to know about this brew: an uninteresting brown brew with a faint nose of cocoa, earth, and malt. The flavors are ok, slightly common of the style without much character - a little roasted chocolate and malt, a bit smooth, but overall unimpressive. I will gladly pay extra for Samuel Smith’s nutbrown.
Blue Moon Nut Brown Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This is a perfect example of what not to brew. We want to drink a refreshing beer not a bottle of trail-mix! Pour me something else PLEASE!
Blue Moon Nut Brown Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours deep brown, with aroma of malt, slight toffee, and caramel. Tastes malty and nutty, with some caramel, almond, and malt flavor at the finish. Pretty good.

Bittings Coal Train Porter;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Porter;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;I had it on tap. It pours black with a small tan head and some lacing.

This was a good one.

Bittings Coal Train Porter;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Porter;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Very malty, almost chocolatey in both aroma and taste, Black in color . Pretty good, but some buttery (diacetyl?) qualities.
Bittings Coal Train Porter;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Porter;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Dark and smooth. Thanks Eric for sharing at Eds. Little bitterness and some roast.
Bittings Coal Train Porter;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Porter;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;pours ddep brown with a thin off white head. Smoky aroma, roasted malt with a hint of coffee.

Dock Street Illuminator;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Dock Street Beer;From old tasting notes. Deep Amber orange color. Bubbly tan head. Spicy aromatic malt nose. Tangy toasted malt flavor. With hints of orange peel and cinnamon. Delicious spicy hop character. Long spicy floral hop finish. Quite good.
Dock Street Illuminator;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Dock Street Beer;@ 50-55 degrees. Pours a very nice looking deep amber with thick beige head....aroma of caramel, berry an lavender. Flavor is nutty, berries, hint of medicinal, off-dry. Somewhat thin body with medium-high carbonation. Overall, not a fan and I am hoping this was just a bad bottle, came from beer trade.
Dock Street Illuminator;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Dock Street Beer;12 oz bottle. Most ratings for Dock Street! Mahogany with a beige head. Nose is raisin and toffee with hints of mocha. Medium body with a tang and a lingering buzz. Taste is grape-ade, tobacco and lightly burnt sugar. Solid representation of the style.
Dock Street Illuminator;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Dock Street Beer;Capone’s draft. Ok for the style, so-so drinkability. A sour, rye edge, after a malt job. Lacy.
Dock Street Illuminator;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Dock Street Beer;Brown pour with red hues. Aromas of yeast, caramel malt, and toffee. A mild hop presence in the taste that is overwhelmed by the raison, caramel malt and yeast flavor. Good brew.
Dock Street Illuminator;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Dock Street Beer;Bottle. Clearer dark amber orange with very light tan head. Prunes, some slight cane sugar, and toffee in the aroma. Definitely not as sweet as suggested in the aroma, and has some nice dark fruits and toffee and a dryish finish. Medium body and a bit sticky.
Dock Street Illuminator;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Dock Street Beer;Clearish dulled down mahogany pour covered by a quickly fading head despite the active carbonation. Clean malty nose where toasted malts are the common denominator, but a fair array of intricacies is developed under our nostrils. For instance, there is a fair amount of fruity, almost juicy component that reminds of plums and raisins - cookie like, it also features chocolatey notions. There is pehaps a bit more hops than your average doppelbock, adding a spicy, leafy, minty undertone that fits the soft roastiness nicely. Makes me think, has there ever been a chocolate mint stout? Anyways, this illuminator follows on with an appropriate nutty (dry hazelnuts) complement on its bready toastiness. The finish is cerealic, toasty, spicy and relatively long. Impressive how it manages not too feel heavier, nor too sweet for all the malt showcase it offers. Not a show-stopper, but very good and not surprisingly from the other beers I’ve tried from lovely Dock Street Brewpub.
Dock Street Illuminator;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Dock Street Beer;"On tap at World Cafe Live beer fest in February. Boy, was I ready for a nice big doppelbock, and this was the perfect start to the Spring drinking season. The beer is as close to drinking freshly cooled mash as you can get - totally malty, almost complete lack of hop presence, in a nutshell - liquid bread. Notes of vanilla, clove. Big body, very sweet finish, and overall refreshing and daringly easy to drink, considering it is nearly 8% ABV. This beer is listed in Michael Jackson’s infamous ""500 Beers to Try"" book. He has quite a point."
Dock Street Illuminator;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Dock Street Beer;"Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle in a pub glass. The beer pours a deep brown color, with a small just off-white to possibly ivory head. The nose is malt in its purest and most unadulterated indulation. Munich malt sets the tone, and is backed up by a splendid chorus of crystal and continental character malts. I think that I get a little bit of Special ""B,"" as well as some aromatic and perhaps Vienna. The palate is also unabashedly malty, giving notes that are very similar to what is advertised in the aroma. No hops are detectable, other than perhaps a bit of balancing. A very nicely done bock, and a steal for the price."
Dock Street Illuminator;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Dock Street Beer;Sampled from a12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a mahogany color with a small brown head. The aroma was strongly malty with notes of chocolate, caramel, and fruit. The flavor was tangy, very richly malty and had notes of nut, caramel, chocolate, apricot and apple. The finish was long, tangy, malty and fruity. The mouthfeel was thick and smooth. Well done.

Ortliebs Select 69 Lager;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ortliebs Brewery & Grille at Sunnybrook Ballroom;6/6/04 at Ortlieb’s Brewery. I haven’t had many good lagers, or many lagers at all for that matter. No, the standard American megabrews don’t count as real beer, either. That said, being a microbrew, this beer is quite good as far as lagers go. Not much head, but the aroma was on the sweet side with a very mild hop presence. Initial taste is sweet and citrusy. Finish wasn’t fantastic, but I did like it. This beer is still worlds above Bud, Coors, Miller, etc. It’s not very complex, but it is refreshing.
Ortliebs Select 69 Lager;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ortliebs Brewery & Grille at Sunnybrook Ballroom;Pours pale yellow, with medium head. TAstes crisp, smooth, refreshing, with some malt, citrus, and hop flavors.

Are the Phillies resurrecting old brews? First the Dock Street, now this. Pours a lighter yellow with ample, fizzy, disappearing head in a plastic cup. Not much aroma other than light graininess. Lots of bready malts in flavor; simple, unpretentious, and quite tasty for a ballpark beer. Cheaper than BMC, too! Refreshing (not that I needed that on a cold, wet, day) and could use a touch of dry bitterness at the end. Unassuming and forgettable."

Chang Beer 6.4%;Phra Nakhon Sri Ayutthaya Province, Thailand;Pilsener - Imperial;ThaiBev - Thai Beverage;Tämä versio suoraan Thaimaasta, 6.4%. Vaaleankeltainen olut kohtalaisella valkoisella vaahdolla, joka jättää aavistuksen pitsiä. Maltainen ja viljainen, aika pitkälle peruslagermainen ja hieman makea tuoksu. Maku maltainen, viljainen, asteen verran normilageria vahvempi. Oiva janojuoma ja varmasti hyvä tulinen ruoan kaveri.

Chang Beer 6.4%;Phra Nakhon Sri Ayutthaya Province, Thailand;Pilsener - Imperial;ThaiBev - Thai Beverage;Eines der besseren Thaibiere und mit 6% auch geschmacklich etwas erwachsener und weniger wässrig. Malzig-bitter im Geschmack, leichter Reis-Nachgeschmack (aber immerhin überhaupt mal einer).
Chang Beer 6.4%;Phra Nakhon Sri Ayutthaya Province, Thailand;Pilsener - Imperial;ThaiBev - Thai Beverage;Can, 6.0%. The good old sour grain aroma. Clear golden colour. Small frothy chalk white head. The flavour is surprisingly malty and does not have much of the graininess of the aroma. Also has a little alcohol punch, but no more than expected for the ABV. Decent for the style.

Odell Cutthroat Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;"""Nice balance between bready malts and floral herbal hops, with a very slight citrus aspect to the aftertaste.

Odell Cutthroat Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Poured a medium amber color with a bit of off-white head. Aromas of light hops and light malt. On the palate, this one is rather light bodied, with mild hops and a little malt.
Odell Cutthroat Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Clear golden with a tiny off white head. Grainy aroma with hints of malt. Grainy flavour with vague caramel and grassy hops. Finished sweet and grainy.
Odell Cutthroat Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;"Tap straight from the Brewery on Ft. Collins’ Oktoberfest- Surprising for a pale ale; not overpoweringly bitter, yet plenty of hoppiness. Finished very clean."
Odell Cutthroat Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Poured a clear golden bronze color with a slightly off-white finger of head. The nose was of earthy and herbal hops, biscut and caramel malts. The flavor started malty and thin with a strange metalic copper taste. Next flowery hops try to exert themselves but the copper taste keeps the the balance off. The finish had citrusy hop notes. The feel was very thin. This Pale Ale was well below average and unimpressive.
Odell Cutthroat Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;I love this brewery! When I found out that they were discontinuing this beer, I ordered the remaining cases from the distribtor. Now, I finally get a chance to rate this beer next to its succesor. 12z, bottled 031605. Light amber hue with finger width head. Good bubble size on remaining head. A lot of grainy maltiness in the nose, with a supporting sweet, slight hop note. Malty kick as it hits the mouth followed by a dry hop note as it rolls over the back of the tongue. I guess that this means a malt/hop balance, but its more of a one/two combo. Good amount of maltiness that, apparently, is typical of the style. But it is followed up by a drying bitterness in the mouth. Am I being redundant? I just wanna be sure that I am good and thorough since this is going into extinction! There are many slight notes in the flavor...cirtus, caramel, and a light roasted note. Well, bottle is empty but the beer was clean! Now for the 5BBL...
Odell Cutthroat Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Bottle. Bottled on 2/22/05. I believe I picked this up in Kansas City. Somewhat doughy in the aroma with a hint of hops and some fruit. Attractive, hazy amber with an off-white head that is mostly diminishing. Slow, widely spread visible carbonation. If I had a dollar for every beer I’ve had that tastes like this...is this from a kit? It tastes a fair amount like Kona Fire Rock Pale. Has some pine to it. Reasonably well balanced, but malt and hops somehow just don’t synchronize very well. Some caramel notes. I have concerns that at 6 months of age, this brew is past its prime. However, it seems to have enough hops for preservative quality. Improves as it warms, however, there really isn’t anything in here that blows me away.
Odell Cutthroat Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Draught. Pours amber with a rocky off-white film and blotchy spotty lacing. Fruit hop floral aroma with nutty caramel malt and a pine nose. Bitter acidic hop and caramel malt (meal) flavor. Medium bodied and creamy palate.
Odell Cutthroat Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Odell Brewing Company;Poured clear yellow with white mostly lasting head. Aroma is malty, leather, yeast. Taste is lightly bitter, some sweet, with a nice dry finish. Palate is between watery and oily.

Odell Easy Street Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Odell Brewing Company;This reminds me of a hefe with light hoppiness and citrus at the end. Easy to drink and has a good collection of flavors. Sunny afternoon kind of beer.
Odell Easy Street Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Odell Brewing Company;355ml can from Binnys Kenwood. Pours a hazed blonde color, fluffy white head. Aroma is light and non-descript. some creamy wheat and slight herb, musty, oatmeal. Flavor is grainy and doughy, some herbal character, sweetness. I’m not into this at all, like drinking dough, not pleasant.
Odell Easy Street Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Odell Brewing Company;Can from Boise Co-op. Very subtle what beer, as in, barely there. Light golden body, skin of head. Faint grainy aroma, white bread. Taste too is bready, wheat. It does have a nice texture though, not enough to salvage this.
Odell Easy Street Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Odell Brewing Company;These days, I expect wheat ales to basically be APAs but this is in the old school American craft style and quite refreshing. It’s cloudy orange in the glass w/ an ton of thick patches of lace after the first few sips. There is a bit of soft fruitiness to this and quite a solid malt presence once you taste it. It’s quite full and creamy on the palate but a good prickle of carbonation keeps it from feeling sluggish. Some sweetness brings out a hint of lemon hops in the finish. This is a really well done beer overall, not aggressive but subtly spicy and flavorful.
Odell Easy Street Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Odell Brewing Company;Can, hazy light yellow. Typical light wheat beer aromas. A bit more sharp hop flavors that I expected. Bold flavors, soft wheat bready trailer. Not Bad
Odell Easy Street Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Odell Brewing Company;Cloudy yellow with small fast fading head.

Two more bottles of this in the sampler so maybe after drinking the other nine beers these will taste better.
Odell Easy Street Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Odell Brewing Company;From 12oz bottle to snifter. Pour is a hazy orange/yellow, thin white head.

Odell Levity Amber Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Odell Brewing Company;this has an interesting, fruity/citrus aroma and a more golden appearance than most amber ales. the taste is nice and fruity, hoppy without being overly bitter, and refreshing. i like this one pretty well. im not a huge pale ale person because lately it seems to be a contest to see how bitter a pale ale can be. but this one is just bitter enough. most hoppy beers are not that refreshing to me, but this one is.
Odell Levity Amber Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Odell Brewing Company;Draft at Jack Quinn’s. Pours clear bright copper with a fizzy beige head.

Odell Curmudgeons Nip;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Odell Brewing Company;Courtesy of markwise, now I can pull yet another very long time ‘want’ off my list, thanks. This 1997 vintage pours clear copper with thin off white head. The aroma is musty malts, smooth blunted pine hops, some caramel candy, a bit of oxidation and thick and tacky summer pavement burned malt syrup. The taste is smooth and yummy goodness with caramel candy, sticky malt sweetness and smooth blunted rolling waving pine hops. Into the finish a bit of dark fruity esters come to the surface and sort of seem like aged pine hop infused brown sugar coated prunes. I think the word “yum” is required here.
Odell Curmudgeons Nip;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Odell Brewing Company;Thanks to markwise for the share. I cant say too much more than mark says below, it was really good and wish I had more.
Odell Curmudgeons Nip;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Odell Brewing Company;"Thanks to the man for this one in trade. Pours caramel brown with a white head. The sticker that he put on top says ""1997 bottle."" Holy hell, for a 14 year-old beer, this one has aged beautifully. Pours caramel brown with a white head. Nose is caramel, brandy, booze, raisins, and slight fruit. A twinge of oxidation, but not really. Flavor has brandy and caramel with slight cardboard that is quickly snuffed out by brandy and caramel. Medium-bodied and enjoyable."
Odell Curmudgeons Nip;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Odell Brewing Company;Pours a nice reddish brown color. Aromas of dark fruits, hops, and a touch of wood. Flavor is smooth caramel malt, wood, and a nice hop.
Odell Curmudgeons Nip;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Odell Brewing Company;2003 bottle shared by Matt. Darker reddish brown with a thin light tan film for a head. Alcohol pops out a bit stronger (surprising once I see the ABV!) in the nose with some molasses and lighter dark malt and caramel. Medium body, lower carbonation. Sweet medium malt. Dark fruit, alcohol. A bit astringent, but very smooth otherwise. Brown sugar. Lingering sweetness, not bad.

Pours a clear orange amber with a fizzy and quickly dissipating off-white head that settles into a thin ring and center whisp, no lacing. Aroma is dark fruits, toffee, caramel, and sweet malts. Flavor is a little more one dimensional, with sweet caramel malts and toffee. A bit thin bodied and middle of the road for the style. Thanks again John!
Odell Curmudgeons Nip;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Odell Brewing Company;Tasted 5/11/08. Apparently a 2005 vintage. Hazy orange golden honey hue. Slight layer of bone white head. Aromas of raisins and wood. Caramel and spices. Citrus and toffee. Big nose. Full bodied and with a nice tingling effervescence. Rather dry finish with a lot of citrus qualities. Peppery and sticky. Bitter hop finish. Piney dry hop palate. Moderate burn. Almost a touch bitter rye malts. Tangy citrus flavor. The bitter hops and the sweet malts have a nice juxtaposition on the palate. Rolls roughly but nicely.

Ruby Mountain Bristlecone Brown Porter;Clover Valley, Nevada, United States;Porter;Ruby Mountain Brewing Company;0.355l bottle shared with The Tasting Crew. This is a deep dark ruby red colored one, it also has a small softly lacing dark beige top. Strange nose. Some old sun damaged chocolate and old brownie cake glazing. Sour cocoa butter with yeast and traces of phenol. Not a super aroma, but I think this is quite a old bottle. It has a just above average carbonation level, the small prickling kind and it feels thin oily in the mouth. Doesn’t taste all that bad really. Softly roasted with a gentle nice sweetness. Dry cocoa powder, nugatti and it’s rounded off with traces of burned sour thin coffee. Quite strange, but actually not bad. Just old. Older than it should be. 15.01.2014

Stoudts Gold Lager;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Stoudts Brewing Co.;This is one of the best Lagers in America and can easily compete with the best European Lagers. It is a clean and simple beer that is easily quaffed and is quite refreshing. I believe the ratings for the beer are lower than they should be because Lagers normally have very little aroma and have only subtle flavors.

Stoudts Gold Lager;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Stoudts Brewing Co.;Rated on 12-22-2010. This beer pours a small frothy, fizzy mostly diminishing white head, hazy yellow body, fizzy carbonation, and one ring of lacing. The aroma is malty, yeasty, hoppy, sweet, and fruity. The taste is sweet, lightly biter, malty, yeasty, citrus hops, and fruity. This beer has a semi-harsh finish. The mouth feel is clean, lively and this beer is medium bodies. This is a session beer. The flavor is a bit of a turn-off for me as it taste somewhat harsh.

Pours a clear but slightly hazy gold color with a thin white head that disappears rather quickly. Aroma of corn and a touch of hops. Thin bodied, balanced between malt and hops. Finishes the same as the taste. Makes me think of a pre-prohibition lager. Not awful, but certainly not the best.

Taste is more toward the malt, bready and easy for the alcohol. Better than I was expecting.
Stoudts Blonde Double Mai-bock;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Stoudts Brewing Co.;Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a nice clear amber color with a one finger head of just off-white foam. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a moderate level of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the beer is quite heavy of a sweet and malty smell with lots of fruit of peach and apricot as well as a bit of toffee and some biscuit and bready malt smells. Along with these aromas are some lighter citrus and earthy hop mixed with just a hint of lemon. Taste – The taste begins with a quite bready and sweet flavor with the sweet being a mix of the lighter fruits that were detected in the nose (peach and apricot). A little bit of orange and grape work their way onto the tongue more toward the middle of the taste, with them being joined by a somewhat grainy flavor. Toward the end, the apricot and peach really intensify and mix with a little amount of an earthy hop flavor and some light hay, leaving a nice fruity sweet and bready flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the average to slightly lower side for a maibock of 7.0 % abv. with a carbonation level that is average. Overall a little thicker body may have been better for the heavy sweet and malty flavors of the brew, but overall the feel was alright. Overall – A very easy drinking maibock at 7.0 % abv. with a nice big sweet and bready taste. Well worth a try.
Stoudts Blonde Double Mai-bock;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Stoudts Brewing Co.;Bomber. Nose is clean, golden sunshine with a little cracker and caramel, noble hops, sunny citrus. Pours orange with above-avg carb and a dense, rocky beige head. Taste is pleasantly sweet with caramel, crackery, and a nice sugary doughy cookie character, just really well-developed malt all around. Hops are juicy lemony citrus with floral nobility, and only somewhat subordinate, and very lightly spicy. Fresh, clean medium-full body, a lot of interest in the mouthfeel (very ’swishable’). No alcohol, refreshing and not too heavy, and free of the boozy-type flaws that plague almost all American attempts at this style. I’ve missed you, Stoudt’s, you do things right. [3.9] Even better at volume! Just perfect. Wow! [4.2]

Stoudts Blonde Double Mai-bock;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Stoudts Brewing Co.;Nose is honey, doughy malt, some rich dark fruits. Almost barleywine esque. Flavor is doughy malt, honey, light crackery malt, some root/herbal qualities.

Stoudts Scarlet Lady Ale ESB;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stoudts Brewing Co.;"As far as English Style Bitter’s go, this beer isn’t bad. It is just sweet enough and has just a tad of hop bitter to it; so basically it is easily quaffable and would be welcome any time I need a refreshing beer. There is no unpleasant aftertaste. There is nothing wrong with this beer, it is a decent ESB. But of course if I wanted to drink an interesting beer this would not be my choice as it just doesn’t hold up to the stronger styles."
Stoudts Scarlet Lady Ale ESB;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stoudts Brewing Co.;More sour than bitter. Pales in comparison to today’s hoppy offerings. Not for me.

Stoudts Scarlet Lady Ale ESB;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stoudts Brewing Co.;This wasn’t one of my favorites from Stoudts, but I am not the biggest fans of extra bitters. The hops are the main theme going on, with of course, an extra bitter aftertaste. It is still a smooth, crisp beer....on the lighter side overall. Dark orange-light copper color. Better than average, but pretty much an across the board 7.

Dominion Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);From old tasting notes. Translucent brown color. Brief tan head. Soft chocolate malt aroma. Roasted malt flavor is on the light side and hints at cocoa and cinnamon. On the light side, this is more like a porter than a stout.

Dominion Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Once bottled, draught only product now found on tap at the brewpub. The recipe has been tweaked over the years, and this is the base beer for Oak Barrel Stout. Five malts are used in the brewing of this beer, including two row pale, carapils, chocolate, caramel, malted wheat, and an addition of roasted barley which is not malted. This beer is hopped with two varieties, Perle and Willamette. That is an awful lot of flavor packed into a 4.7% abv brew, and makes for a truly fantastic stout to drink on any number of occasions. Dominion Stout pours to an opaque ink black color with a thick and creamy tan head, and a soft carbonation. The nose is very inviting on this beer. Very robust aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, sweet malt, and slight grassy hop aroma floods the nose. The palate is very soft and full with lots of big malt flavors. Sweet malt, chocolate, caramel, and coffee flavors marry with a slight bit of roast. Dominion Stout finishes with a delicious creamy, silky chocolate/coffee flavor up front, and ends with just a touch of roasty flavor, and enough hop bitterness as to make this beer not too cloying.
Dominion Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Thanks to Argo. 2003 bottled. Nasty nasty stuff. Completely skunked. I hope this isn’t what it’s supposed to taste like.
Dominion Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);A pleasant if only mild stout. Very creamy with some pleasant vanilla overtones.
Dominion Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Appearance: deep and dark, practically black, under a short filmy brownish head. Aroma: espresso bitterness marks the olfactory aura, joined by pitch and tar and a bit of anise, but mildly. Taste: full-bodied, rich, malty, a bit sweet, but also with sufficient bitterness, a tiny touch of hops. Dark, complex and tasty, yes, but never quitting with the bitter, roasty feel. Could’ve done with some more in the mouthfeel, though, some power on the palate, a fling with creamy texture, or a dalliance with lush malt. This stout unfortunately falls short, in terms of what I’m yearning for with this style, more fruity, too, would be nice, but a greater cocoa feel is greatly missing. I’ve got to say I’m a bit disappointed in this stout, and I’m glad I’ve got some preferable versions handy in the fridge.
Dominion Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pours black with a light brown head. Taste is of coffee and chocolate malt. Mouthfeel is a bit watery. Considering how good Dominion’s other brews are, this one is very boring and non-distinctive. Not bad, but not recommended either.
Dominion Black & Tan;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Very dark maroon, 6 bubble head, yet very effervescent. Aroma of roasted coffee. Very thin. Not complex. I had to taste it 3 times before I could remember it enough to write down my impression.
Dominion Black & Tan;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pours deep chocolate brown. Medium creamy coffe colored head. Slight lacing. Smells of coffee, flowery hops and carmelized malts. First sip, mild chocolate, leading into a bland middle with a finish reminiscent of the oak barrell stout. A touch of hops, choclate and coffee with a side of allchohol. The feeling is light and very watery, not much texture and the carbonation seems to overpower a bit. If the excellent finish was brought forward this could be a much better black and tan.
Dominion Black & Tan;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Draft at Dulles. This to me seemd like a watered down version of the stout; which I really enjoy. The Ale just did not add much and in fact detracted. Definitely have the stout over this."

Dominion Black & Tan;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Just an average black and tan, had this a few times both on tap and in bottles.

Creamy beige head. Soft fruity candy-like malt nose. Tangy fruity malt flavor hints at prunes and currants. There’s an underlying yeastiness that imparts a uniqueness to this ale. Very good indeed.

Stoudts Abbey Double;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Stoudts Brewing Co.;"Tap from just a small sampler (2oz?). The most obvious quality to me was how much this reminded me of a tripel; plum and raisin, sure, but general maltiness with honey on top and much more in the way of phenolic overtones. Mahogany pour, medium body, nice and a touch spicy."
Stoudts Abbey Double;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Stoudts Brewing Co.;"12 oz glass off of tap...Large light brown head that dies quickly. Hazy brown with a red hue.

Stoudts Abbey Double;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Stoudts Brewing Co.;750 ml bottle that I have had for several years - I’m not sure of the age of the bottle. Pours a crystal clear deep red with a moderate, sudsy off-white head that is initially more reminiscent of the head on a glass of Coca Cola than anything else. The head quickly settles into an incomplete film and leaves a partial coating on the glass. Pleasant aroma of malt and brown sugar. The flavor is malty and a bit richer than the aroma suggests, but with none of the brown sugar sweetness. Fairly smooth with just a hint of alcohol at the very end. One of the better offerings I have had from this brewer.
Stoudts Abbey Double;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Stoudts Brewing Co.;An ’01 vintage bottle. Vinous. Possibly from its superannuation? Rather sour. But the other flavors poked through.
Stoudts Abbey Double;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Stoudts Brewing Co.;Very nice authentic Dubbel. Primarily a malty flavor but dubbel fruit tones come make their presence known in the aroma. Sampled at Stoudts 17th Annual Microfest: June 2008
Stoudts Triple;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Stoudts Brewing Co.;This Belgian Abbey-Style Ale is very smooth wirh a great pallet. Make sure when you pour it in a glass that you leave the last inch of liquid in the bottle. The reason for this is so you can get all the full flavor from the un filtered sediment. When about an inch is left roll the bottle on it's side rhen swirl in the bottle and top your glass with all the great flavor many leave behind.

West Virginia Blackwater Stout;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Stout;West Virginia Brewing Company;Enjoyed at the brewpub in Morgantown, it’s 4.8% abv.

West Virginia Blackwater Stout;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Stout;West Virginia Brewing Company;My first impression is that someone collected the water used to put the campfire out and served it up in a stout glass.

West Virginia Blackwater Stout;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Stout;West Virginia Brewing Company;Universally a good example of this style. Pitch black. Very little head, just a girdle around the inside edge of the glass. Can’t smell much, the aroma is well behaved. Flat like a nitro beer on the palate. Not like imp stout in any fashion. Lighter than an Irish Dry. Fine lacing and legs on this beast. Building back of throat bitterness like I just ate some charred grill meat.

Sweet sugary dark caramel malty aroma has some roasted smoky notes and hints of salty black olives.

West Virginia Appalachian Ale;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;some sweetness with a nutty flavor and a hoppy citrus and pine presence tempered with a substantial fresh from the farm malt character. vibrant carbonation makes it great for whenever you want to cool off. deep amber color adds intrigue.
West Virginia Appalachian Ale;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;My friend Big D turned me onto this brewery about a year ago. I had to drink another before rating the beer, and I saw this bottle at vintage Estates, I had to pick one up. The last time I tasted this beer it was flat and skunked. But this bottle was fresh, and this was a decent beer. I liked the hoppy flavor, surprised from a small brewery and this style, and balanced with a nutty slight bitter finish. Decent CO2, I guess I am going to have to try a few more from this brewery. Are you in Dennis?

West Virginia Appalachian Ale;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;"On tap at Bar 101 in Charleston. Seems much more like a very malty pale ale, or IPA than a ""Brown Ale"". It poured a nice reddish brown with a slightly hoppy aroma. Flavor was strongly hops, with a bit of a sweet malty finish. Overall, not bad. For WV brews, I’ll take just about anything from Mountaineer over this though."
West Virginia Appalachian Ale;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub. Like a red, only maltier like a brown. Pink reddish colour with some head and lace. Hops there as well as malt. Above average carbonation that was higher than needed. 5.2% abv. The one I liked the most for drinkability and balance.

Could definately have a bunch on a gameday.
West Virginia Appalachian Ale;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;I don’t beleive this to be a brown ale, way too many hops for that, but it was a decent beer nonetheless from a very small brewpub.

Pours a cloudy yellowish color with a thin and wispy off-white head that disappears quickly. Spotty lacing on the glass. Fruity aroma with notes of wheat.

It has above average carbonation, and some odd water as if warning me the water is safe to drink but not tasty.
West Virginia Grist Mill Wheat;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Wheat Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;My 800th rating! Go me!... Murky pear juice color. Quickly diminishing white head.

West Virginia Cheat Mountain Gold;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Cream Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;Enjoyed this beer many of times at C.J. Maggies in Elkins, WV. Worked at a research forest in Cassity, WV. Beautiful gold color with a sweet and light taste of hops.
West Virginia Cheat Mountain Gold;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Cream Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;Pint at the Brewpub. Poured a transparent golden color. Very light, very clear. Aroma was pretty much non-existant. Flavor.....very light. Lightly sweet, but not in a malty way. No hop flavor at all. Absolutely no bitterness. Crisp though. Overall....not great. Probably the worst WV Brewed beer that I’ve had. Not to say it was BAD. Just not something I’d try again.
West Virginia Cheat Mountain Gold;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Cream Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. This beer is a pale yellow-gold color with a thin and fizzy white head that diminishes quickly. Spotty lacing. Weak hops and bready malt in the nose. Light-bodied with flavors of grain, malt and light hops. The finish is lightly hopped and short. Typical half-assed gateway beer for macro drinkers, barely average.
West Virginia Cheat Mountain Gold;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Cream Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;After a night of packing up Kara’s things to bring her home from WVU we stopped over for a few beers and this was the 1st one I tried.

Has some interesting mild erthy tones in the background. Finish is well mannered and un assuming. Nice.
West Virginia Cheat Mountain Gold;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Cream Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;Very malty, *beer* aroma with light whiskey notes. Tangy, cereal, nicely hopped. Lightly sweet, but mostly crisp and crackery. Good CO2. Good light brewpub offering. The pub has changed hands recently, and the lite offering is often the bellweather for the brews to follow, so this appears to be a good sign, given the style.
West Virginia Cheat Mountain Gold;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Cream Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;"West Virginians are VERY lucky to have this little low-hopped gem in their midst. Cheat Mountain breaks the often over-hopped microbrew mold with a bold maltiness and light carbonation and only the lightest of hop touches. Very similar to Belgium’s Primus. I’d consider it one of the top 10 lager-type beers I have ever had, ""and I’ve had them all over the woild"" (apologies to Irving Woltz of the Godfather)."
West Virginia Cheat Mountain Gold;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Cream Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;"Looks and tastes like all the other ""freebie"" swill lagers I drank throughout the day while attending a couple tailgates before the WVU football game. Not good. Hard to believe it’s an ale as it has all the characteristics of a pale lager. This brewery is going downhill fast."
West Virginia Neds Pale Ale;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;West Virginia Brewing Company;just a nice american pale ale. good body and mouthfeel substantial as it is in flavors of pine flower and citrus hops combined with a good sweet and earth like malt that is caramel like in character. nicely bitter and refreshingly so. nice ipa like aroma of hops with just a certain german like spiciness to it. american traditional yet demonstrative. GOOD.
West Virginia Neds Pale Ale;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;West Virginia Brewing Company;On Tap at the Brew Pub. Pour was a nice copper amber. Aroma was nice and hoppy. As was the flavor. Good, bittersweet malt flavor. This is how you make a pale ale. Although more like an IPA. Still, delicious. My face lit up at first taste because some of what I’ve had from WVBC has been mediocre. This is not. This is top shelf. Nice.
West Virginia Neds Pale Ale;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;West Virginia Brewing Company;Enjoyed on-tap at the Morgantown brewpub. Good C-hop aroma, its 5.8% abv.

This beer pours a clear amber color with a minimal white head that evaporates pretty quickly. Thin top ring of lacing with spots underneath. Hops and citrus in the nose. Medium-bodied and moderately hoppy with just a bit of bready malt and caramel for balance. The finish is citrus and hops and leaves a lightly bitter aftertaste. A little unbalanced but decent.
West Virginia Neds Pale Ale;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;West Virginia Brewing Company;11/1/07 - Sample at brewpub. Light amber color. Solid carmal and raisin/plum malt backbone with cascade/chinook hops. Fruit and floral popping in the mouth. Crisp finish. If not the best by WV, only the Appy ale comes close. Good beer.
West Virginia Neds Pale Ale;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;West Virginia Brewing Company;Floral hops aroma but not pine. Smells like IPA and looks like IPA. Rather clear. Somewhat like a lighter IPA impact but that is only on the beginning. Starts off fruity then it takes a while to morph into an offensive IPA blast. Perhaps a little lighter than many IPA. Not quite as mediciny as I expected. Lingering bitter finish that hangs for a while.

Big saaz nose mixed with pils malt. The body was firm and malty with just enough hops to keep you thirsty. Good long malty/hoppy finish. A baby Tuppers Pils.
West Virginia Bowden Bitter;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;West Virginia Brewing Company;I had a bitter by this brewing company at the Penn Brewery festival on June 4. I can only assume that this was the beer as it’s the only Bitter they brew. It sucked. Maybe those good old boys grow their own hops down there and tweak them a little. The flavor was overwhelming alright, if it was hops, but I’d never tasted anything like it. You could’nt call it a good flavor either. It was the only beer I poured out that day.
West Virginia Oktoberfest;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;West Virginia Brewing Company;11/1/07 - sample at brewpub. Carmel with a very little roast. Muddled hop finihsh. Soapy - tannic finish w/ the hops. Ok, not bad.
West Virginia Oktoberfest;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;West Virginia Brewing Company;Rating #300... Pretty good lager. It was quite smokey in the taproom and the beer was about 15 degrees too cold, but hey, it’s a lager sooo... The aroma was moderately malty, but due to the temperature of the beer and especially the cigarette smoke in my face, that’s about all I could get out of the nose. Probably not fair to the beer, but it gets low marks for aroma. Sparkling clear Copper. The color of a freshly minted penny. Large, frothy white head. Quickly and entirely diminishing. Malty flavor. Nicely hopped. Perfectly balanced. Not sweet at all. Light to medium-bodied. Fizzy. Watery mouthfeel. Crisp, dry finish. Not a bad beer, but I’ve had better Octoberfests.
West Virginia Hoppy Hippie;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;Damned if I know where they came up with this name, but it's a huge misnomer. Cloudy red/brown, with medium beige head. Aroma is moderately sweet and malty. Taste is along the lines of a Scottish Ale -- it's a bit on the sweet side, but not too bad. What bitterness there is is limited to the back of the throat into the swallow. Unimpressive beer.
West Virginia Hoppy Hippie;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;This beer rocks. Don''t let the name fool you. This is not an acutely hopped beer. Very rich and Malty, but not sweet. Lightly carbonated (very much like a cask-conditioned beer). Oily mouthfeel. Well balanced. Dry finish. Excellent brown ale. First unfiltered brown ale for me. Great beer drinking experience.

Ruby Mountain Elevation Pale Ale;Clover Valley, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ruby Mountain Brewing Company;Draft. Pours a clear amber/copper color with a small off white head.

Ruby Mountain Elevation Pale Ale;Clover Valley, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ruby Mountain Brewing Company;"I had this on tap as the ""Elevation Ale"" at Elevation 486 in Twin Falls, Idaho. It has an amber/orange color with a slightly off-white head and lacing. The aroma is largely pine with some grapefruit and a small amount of pale malt in it. The flavor is medium hops up front with a malty middle, leading to a slightly spicy finish. A refreshing pale ale good on a warm day."
Ruby Mountain Elevation Pale Ale;Clover Valley, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ruby Mountain Brewing Company;Well, I’m not totally sure where to put this ranking. The bottle said Buckaroo Pale Ale, and it definitely tasted more like a pale ale than a golden ale. In fact, it tasted just about what you could call a proto-typical pale ale. Nothing outstanding, but nothing detrimental either.
Ruby Mountain Elevation Pale Ale;Clover Valley, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ruby Mountain Brewing Company;Draft at Red Lion in Elko, NV: Light copper pour with a small white head. Very nice lacing. Nose is light hops, both floral and citrus with just a touch of malt. Taste is well hopped and consistent of the floral and citrus from the aroma. Hints of caramel malt. Similar in characteristics to their amber ale, but with a drier hop finish.

Sonoran Desert Amber;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;On tap at Pinnacle Peak Patio, it pours a nice deep amber color but with little to no head. Good flavor of mild hops, malts and even caramel but far from original. That’s not to say it was bad, far from it, it just didn’t blow my mind. Nice, somewhat bitter finish.
Sonoran Desert Amber;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;"On cask at brewery: Though I’m not a huge fan of the style, this is one of the best ambers I’ve ever had: nice caramel character without being too sweet; earthy malt notes, balanced hop profile, and smooth palate made this a pleasant surprise."

Sonoran Desert Amber;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;"Light amber color with an okay head... the hopping makes this drink. It’s present, but not overbearing. ""Clean."" The aroma promised a better bitter hop taste than the flavor delivered, but it remains a pleasurable brew that one can enjoy all night long.

Sonoran Desert Amber;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;Nice amber color with a tan head, sweet malty aroma. Taste was a mix of hops and caramel notes. Light on the palate.
Sonoran IPA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;Fair aroma, not much there for an IPA...decent if it were a pale, kind of cloudy with thin head, very lean watery, not a bad beer per se, just on light side of hops etc.
Sonoran IPA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;Backlog, from notes. On tap @ Timberwolf, Tempe, 27 May 2001. Aroma’s: notably caramel and some fruit. Flavor is light sweet, with only a mild bitter finish.
Sonoran IPA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;Enjoyed on tap at the brewery showcase restaurant. Hoppy aroma, cloudy grapefruit colour with white head and lacey. High carbonation. A bitter that is more than a regular IPA although not at a double IPA level.
Sonoran IPA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;Solid representation of the style but nothing that separates it. Glimmers of copper, gold and brass when held to the light. Aroma is grapefruit, lemon peel, pine, and malt. Flavor is quite earthy/grassy...medium mouthfeel and highly drinkable.
Sonoran IPA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;Pours ordinary pale ale/IPA amber with contrasting head. Nose is mixed citrus with an herbal grassy quality. Black tea flavors are present on the palate. THe herbal grassy components carry through to the flavor, and the finish is medium. Carbonation is good and this IPA is quite drinkable.
Sonoran IPA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;"Pours from the growler a brilliant copper-amber color. It is topped by a frothy tan colored head that is initially two-fingers thick. The aroma is sharp and pungent a mix of pine, menthol and perhaps a hint of sweet citrus fruits. The taste of the beer is sharp and pungent as well. There is a nice maltiness here that is lightly sweet, with a touch of caramel and a dry toasted malt note in the finish with a bit of biscuit-like notes thrown into the mix. The beer is light enough on the palate to be quite drinkable, but still has a richness and fullness to it that accentuates the hop character. There is a solid bitterness throughout this beer as well; starting with a gripping raw hoppy bitterness, moving through to a long herbal bitterness in the finish. The really striking thing about this beer is that there is a striking mintiness to this beer. It is quite noticeable and really dominates the flavor profile. While this does not have the typical flavor profile of an IPA, the mix it does have is striking, and atypical enough to make this a really enjoyable beer. I was pleasantly surprised by this beer and definitely recommend it heartily."
Sonoran IPA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;Sonora IPA pours to a bright amber color with a tight white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose is somewhat fragrant with some cirtic and piney hop aroma, but they do not smell as vibrant and zesty as a good AIPA should. If this beer is dry hopped, I could not tell. The palate was a bit on the lean side, with some good caramel and pale malty flavors, and some light touches of fruit. Sonora IPA finishes with a dry, slightly citric and piney bitter tang that slightly lingers. Hummm. This is a good beer, but hardly earth shaking, and the hops didn’t get my teeth buzzing. In all fairness to the brewery, I believe my bottle sample that I had was old and stale, and really this beer is better than the example I tasted. I visited the brewpub in Pheonix after this bottle sample, and had some fantastic, fresh, and delicious beers there. I need another crack at this one, and will have to re-rate, because having sampled their other products fresh, I know this beer is better. Its a nice beer with some nice hop character, but not an IPA that most hop heads would get excited about. That being said, I would enjoy this beer as a nice one to have as a before dinner drink, or a thirst quencher after some yard work. If you see this beer in your market, and the price is right, I say go for it if you can get fresh product. But if you are a hop head, and the bottle looks old, and you are looking for a hop buzz, you might want to think twice before you shell out some cash for this one.
Sonoran IPA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;"On tap at brewery: This actually has less hop charactor, but certainly more bitterness than Burning Bird; rather simple, but nice round maltiness.. OK."
Sonoran IPA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;tap-scottsdale beer fest-pours a clear orange hue with a small white head. citric/pine aroma with some good malt base, more like an english IPA. flavors are piney hops, earthy hops and good malt backbone. not overly bitter, but there is some pine coming through in the finish. well rounded body! I would love to have this again!
Sonoran IPA;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;IPA;Sonoran Brewing Company;this is your typical average- above average IPA...nice pine floral hops that makes it easy to drink and quaff. had 3 back to back to back. quite good for a lower alcohol ipa. go!
Sonoran Top Down Golden Pale Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Sonoran Brewing Company;I am rating this one a little higher than normal due to the fact that my girlfriend loved this one. A very light golden pale ale, but I think the alaskan Golden pale, is a better buy.
Sonoran Top Down Golden Pale Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Sonoran Brewing Company;Clear gold in color, decent white head, fair lace. Nose is malt, slightly floral. Start sweet, the top light, the finish is acidic, dry, lightly hopped, and quite uninteresting.

Sonoran Heartland Hefe;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;Sampled at the Arizona Craft Brewers Guild 2008 Strong Beer Fest, on February 17, at the Mesa Amphitheatre. A hazy golden color with a small foamy white head. Aroma of grain and citrus. Pretty standard tasting American Wheat. Refreshing, but not spectacular.
Sonoran Heartland Hefe;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;pours a hazy yellow with brown/orange edges and a white ring for a head. faint aroma consists of light graininess, lemon and vanilla. the flavor is strange... pineapple, light wheat and grain all hidden under a huge dose of sour freshly squeezed lemon juice. ( i got a second sample to make sure that a lemon was not put in the glass. but, sure enough.) medium body but the sour lemon makes it seem like a thin mouth feel. it’s not terrible but it’s not good either. tastes like watery unsweetened lemonade...
Sonoran Heartland Hefe;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;The Hefe that I had must have been different from others. I very much so enjoyed this Hefe. It was full of flavor, had a wonderful palate and looked, smelled, and had a Hefe consistency. This is the best Hefe that I have had out of a microbrewery...took a bottle home with me.
Sonoran Heartland Hefe;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;"On Tap at Brewery: This is actually quite a clean for a hefe; smooth and drinkable without alot of phenelics; light banana and lemon notes; a hefe I practically enjoyed."
Sonoran Heartland Hefe;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;Bottle: I just don't like heffe, I try but i don't like it. Poured like Dawn dish detergent. Aroma of Lemon, Bananna, and Pinapple. Tasted like Pinapple weird shit. Doesn't taste like beer. Then again i don't like Heffe.
Sonoran Heartland Hefe;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;Hazy golden color. Fruity hoppy aroma. Sweet, bountiful berry flavor. Not a true hefe. Hard to make what of this beer. Not terrible, just not one of their best.
Sonoran Heartland Hefe;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;This wheat beer is a gold color with a bit of chill haze to it (note I did not pour in the yeast at the bottom of the bottle). It pours with a thin white head that fades quickly. There is a slightly catty hoppy aroma. Smells grainy, and has an aroma that I usually associate with an American lager. Quite clean tasting overall, has a hint of fruity sweetness to it. Has a bit of hop bitterness at the end, and is well carbonated.
Sonoran Heartland Hefe;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;Very lemony, as if I was drinking a Saxer Lemon Lager by mistake. Thin and watery, too. I wonder if this has gone bad or it just is supposed to taste this bad? Thin and one-dimensionally sourish. TERRIBLE, and an inexcusible embarrassment to Sonora!
Sonoran Heartland Hefe;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;Yellow, slightly cloudy, with a good head. Pretty weak beer. Not much aroma at all. A bit of hops, but not much. Arizona Lawnmower beer.
Sonoran Heartland Hefe;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Sonoran Brewing Company;Medium gold color, slightly hazy. Large foamy head. Aroma is malty and a touch floral. A medium bodied weizen. Malts are mild and slightly sweet. Not very hoppy. Very smooth taste. Well balanced. That said it also doesn’t have much flavor. It also a little lemony tasting and funky. Not one of Sonoras better efforts. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is very slightly bitter.
Sonoran Old Saguaro Barleywine;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sonoran Brewing Company;Bottle, aged sample. Clear copper color. Aroma is caramel malts, faint papery notes of oxidation. Flavor matches. Sort of light in body for the style, and still a bit hot despite the time in the bottle. Hurt by a bit of a papery note. This did not stand up well to aging, which is a bit of a disappointment in a barleywine, but it was just a bit too light for that treatment in my opinion.
Sonoran Old Saguaro Barleywine;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sonoran Brewing Company;355mL. Clear amber, low carbonation with no head. Nose is maple, peanut brittle, toffee, mint, lemon iced tea. Taste is lemon, coffee, dusty, paper. Neutral sugar, tannic. Not my style.

Sonoran Old Saguaro Barleywine;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sonoran Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from bhensonb (maybe a 2004 since that is what he rated and because of the general characteristics of the beer?) Nose is light toffee, prunes, and an overall oxidized aroma. Murky lighter brown with a very slight bit of carbonation. Flavor is somewhat oxidized, toffee, and a bit of candi sugar. Body is somewhat watery. To be savored like a fine cognac?

Sonoran Old Saguaro Barleywine;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sonoran Brewing Company;An average BW at best. To be fair I am not sure of the vintage I ran across, it is possible that it was an older vintage and this is a BW that doesn’t stand the test of time well. I didn’t find it to be particularly well balance. No boosiness, the odor seemed muted and a bit musty, malty, a touch of dark fruits on the nose. The color and carbonation were proper. I would like to give this brew another shot, if I knew what vintage I had so I could make a fairer assessment. I wouldn’t seek this beer out again, but if I were to run across it, it was reasonably priced and I would give it another try. Not a drain pour by any means, but the one I had was nothing special either.
Sonoran Old Saguaro Barleywine;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sonoran Brewing Company;Bottle:   1999 vintage from brewandbbq.   Intense deep caramel, minimal sudsy head, dies on the spot, no lacing.   Pretty much what I expected.   Strong musty caramel nose... oh, and HUGE oxidation.   Surprisingly caramel sweet, brown sugar, very musty and basement like on the tongue.   Despite the oxidation, its not half bad.   Sweetness dies quickly.   Not much body is left on this one.   Lingering caramel sweetness, strong but dull in flavor.   Otherwise strong and dank basement mustiness.   Held up fairly well for 12 years despite the oxidation.
Sonoran Old Saguaro Barleywine;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sonoran Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours an amber toned body with an off whtie head. Herbal hopped body light pine, herbal, and a plant tone i’m unfamiliar with. Lighter fruit note s citrus and peach. A bit warming with tart finish. Odd ball.

New Amsterdam Amber Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle: Finally scrounged one of these Utica-made NA beers. I’m revisiting this after tasting the original in the distant misty past. One of the first US micro beers I tasted. Pours a clear orange-amber ale in the glass. ! finger rocky cap, goes to a ring but laces the glass. Caramel maltiness, some fruits and dried grass in the nose Moderate body, thinnish mouth feel. Caramel malts in front are balanced with piney hop and fruity esters, finish dries out with a decent hop bite. My memory is foggy but this seems a tad thin compared to the AN amber of yore, nothing outstanding but it’s a decent enough amber ale for sessions.
New Amsterdam Amber Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Brewed in Saratoga Springs, but by who? New Amsterdam was one of the pioneers of the craft beer movement in New York in the 1980s. It disappeared for a while, and I suppose the brand has been picked up or restarted by someone else. Nice label. Brown pour. A bit of citrus tang and honey in the aroma. Pretty dry, medium-bodied ale, with a touch of esters and some honey in the aftertaste. It is still a good brew.
New Amsterdam Amber Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. I remember drinking this back when I first got into craft beer, or microbrews as they were called, back in the early 90’s. After cracking this one open and drinking it I must admit it’s pretty much the way I remebered it.....decent looking amber body with a smaller slightly bubbly off white head, sweet aroma with notes of caramel and toffee and a similar taste with a medium mouthfeel but lots of carbonation. Nothing special by any means other then the nostalgia for me but boy does this one take me back.
New Amsterdam Amber Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;12 oz bottle, pours an opaque dark brown color with little head. Aroma at first is sharply hoppy and dry but later becomes sweeter and maltier. Flavor is bitter with a bit of sweetness, kind of roasty. Palate is average, kind of rough, but somewhat full body. Not a bad beer, but nothing special.
New Amsterdam Amber Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottled. This says it was brewed in Saratoga Springs, not Utica, which makes me wonder if Olde Saratoga/Mendocino is doing the brewing/owns this now. Pours with pretty much no head, darkish brown-gold-amber. Aroma is syrupy, malty, sweet, bitter. Not much to the flavor, just a vegetal malty bitterness with a spoiled milk finish. Blech. Not really worth drinking at all.
New Amsterdam Amber Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;From a 12 fl. oz. bottle no. 4123114080148. The pour is definitely amber with just about no head and light lacing. The aroma is fresh malts and slightly hopped. The mouthfeel is adequate. The flavor is about a 50-50 balance of malts and fresh hops. Slight aftertaste. It was not as good as I remembed it when I first had it in the late ’80’s but it was still OK.
New Amsterdam Amber Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;this brew was okay. I tried it at a beerfest because I’d never seen it before. It was very ....forgettable. Nothing really stood out. It wasn’t good and it wasn’t that bad. If your looking for run-of-the-mill beer. This is it.

Backcountry Pilsner (Ptarmigan);Frisco, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Backcountry Brewery (CO);"From May 2007 This one pours from 22oz bottle a clear straw gold with a large head of foam that settles down but stays for the entire session and has good lacing. The smell is of malt and it's very sweet on the nose. The taste on first sip is strong on the sweet malt with some earthiness and a touch of bitterness near and through the finish. I think that it's similar to a lot of American Pilsners I've had in the past(New Belgium Blue Paddle comes to mind) but it lacks a certain oomph that would make it stand out. A few more sips in and I'm getting a ""salty"" flavour that I'm not really enjoying all that much. Hmm....pretty ordinary; I note that the best by date has March notched and a pen mark where 2007 would be so maybe I'll have to try again with a fresher bottle if I can find one. As is, it's pretty ordinary."

New Belgium Frambozen;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"From Nov 2005 Poured from bottle(room temp) a deep gold-brown with a good sized head that showed good lacing. The smell is all raspberry and that's just fine with me as I want as much infusion of the fruit in this ale as I can get! The taste is a wonderful mix of raspberry and malt and works so darn well, it's hard to put the glass down. I've enjoyed this brew for many years and will continue to as long as NB wants to brew it. ;^)"

The brew is very clear walnut brown... just spots of lacing. Nose is distinctive ""real raspberry"".... also shows a nice clean brown malty character with deep toast and hints of lite cocoa. Flavor mirrors the nose and is actually pretty dry... just clean malts and sorta jammy raspberry essence.... pretty refreshing actually. Body is a bit on the light side, but plenty of smooth small bubble carbonation makes it seem a little creamy."

Weyerbacher ESB;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Thanks to Leopold Stoch for this one. Hazy amber body with a tall, long lasting head of off-white. Caramel aroma. The flavor starts sweet with some bitterness in the middle and a long caramel finish. Needs some hop dryness to balance out some of this sweetness. Smooth with plenty of body.
Weyerbacher ESB;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;"Appearance: This beer pours a soft transparent copper color with a very creamy 2 finger off-white head with decent retention. Mediocre lacing. Smell: It has a good aroma but it is subtle and reserved. After some contemplation I came up with sweet bread and yeast, slight fruity tones and gentle hops. Taste: Like the smell the taste is gentle and approachable. It is not the most interesting ESB I have ever tasted but it is quite palatable. It seems to have a pretty straight forward bready malt and hop balance until the aftertaste. The aftertaste is a bit odd. There is very little of the bitter I was looking for up front it seems all the bitter is waiting for the finish. I’m not quite sure what to make of this...? Mouthfeel: This beer has a very light mouthfeel that seems to disappear into nothing through the middle. To its credit it is very smooth. Drinkability: Overall this is a decent beer but a bit lacking in luster. I would be too bored to have a second but it would be palatable if I was interested so the drinkability is what I’d call ""Ho Hum."" Hope this is helpful. Cheers!"

The flavor is a bit more palatable with the sourness more subdued and some cloves and citrus present as well. There were no banana flavors noted at all.

This beer really doesn’t have those attributes, but it does work well enough to compliment apps and football watching...."

Weyerbacher India Pale Ale;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Great IPA I had on draft, though it was listed as 7.2%. I asked if this was the Hops INfusion and was told FUCK OFF, this is NOT Hops Infusion my friend, you are trippin--so I punched the bartender in the dick with a $2 tip on my tab, bitches, and drank these things all night. It was sweet, because this beer has a high hop profile, medium grapefruit hip pine, all clean and intense and in your face. Very good IPA that is light coppper hazy. Nice brew, despite the bartending crew.
Weyerbacher India Pale Ale;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Smells citrussy and sweet. Tastes citrussy and sweet with some tea elements. Pretty straight forward and basic.

Weyerbacher Quad;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;DATE: July 19, 2018... OCCASION: another beautiful summer day in need of a nice drink.... GLASSWARE: La Fin du Monde tulip... pours a dark amber body, almost a brown tea consistency, holding a ring of thin white bubbles... thick, boozy red grapes, heavy plasticized ether, grapefruit, prune, plum, bourbon, caramel, cilantro, and roasted malts.... sips as a lab beaker might, drips at a time, warming and thick with a cough syrupy sweetness.... a slow burn lingers... somewhat dry and buttery... its strength is in its weighty plum and bourbon, smooth and satisfying, with caramel, toffee, and peat... this wins with its late nutty finish, its malty base, its caramel sweetness, and an overblown 11.9% ABV that slowly uncoils its wallup.... have had better, tastier, dark ales, but this is solid enough...
Weyerbacher Quad;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a clear reddish brown with a thin beige ring that fizzles out before you can set the bottle down. Sweet smelling aroma of candied fruits and brown sugar. Maybe a hint of chocolate.

Weyerbacher Quad;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;12 oz bottle from Liberty Beer in Pittsburgh. Strong and sweet, way too high on the perfume. I think the alcohol level was too high on purpose.

Full body, dense flavor, silky, sticky texture, very hot mouthfeel but well blended, average length. Very sweet but nicely balanced by bitterness and alcohol.

Weyerbacher Raspberry Imperial Stout;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Originally reviewed: 4/29/09. Pours a very thick black with a small tan head on top. No retention and no lacing at all. Smells of dark chocolate, raspberries, strawberry, and dairy sweetness. Mouthfeel is decent. Some crisp carbonation, but overall pretty smooth. Flavor is full of fruity chocolate. The raspberry is there, but it’s not in your face. Hints of the fruit come through, but it is mostly cocoa and milky sweetness in this one. Decent. I liked this. Recommend.
Weyerbacher Raspberry Imperial Stout;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;The last bottle from ’05 or ’06 saved for Birthday week...Rich and dark, initially with a bit of licorice and Robitussin flavor but as it warmed and breathed the Raspberry still came through nicely. Quite warming. I miss this beer. sniff
Weyerbacher Winter Ale;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;This is what I prefer my winter ales to be like.

Aass Pilsner;Drammen, Norway;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aass Bryggeri;Clear gold, soapy white smattering of head. Grassy, hint of pepper. Typical pale pils, nothing special. Beer selection for Norway in EPCOT for #SnackCOT2019.

Coors Extra Gold;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Walmart started selling this at 15 bucks a 30 pack. Who's gonna pass up a deal like that? Xtra gold is what it is. A decent lager best cold.
Coors Extra Gold;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Really nice easy lager, when |I was 18 it was a very good beer, the women were cold but the beer was gold! Now I am 45 I lament on this old dear! The modern Coors Extra is rubbish and the pub has had become a Islamic furbish when I was 45 and the Masjid is a dive!

Color is bright crystal clear gold with medium carbonation and a soft white head. Aroma is mild hop spice and a light corn like grain scent. It has a lighter body with a smooth yet crisp mouthfeel. Flavor is light, giving a nice pilsner malt base with a slight sweetness backed by a mild hop spice and ends with a light bitterness. Aftertaste is clean and the bitterness leaves it with a slightly dry feel. Overall it's not bad, I don't really like this type of brew but I would take it over most of them.
Coors Extra Gold;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);One of Coors True hidden gems when you can find it... pours a light golden color with a smooth and refreshing flavor..!! Supposedly a “blended beer” of Irish Red and Coors Light..?
Coors Extra Gold;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Better than the standard coors because it has a hint of caramel sweetness. Tried at the brewery in 2007.
Coors Extra Gold;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);From old tasting notes. Light golden color has a greenish hue. Nice small bubbles support a medium white head. Light malty aroma of grain. Semi-sweet malt flavor with a wisp of hops. A small step up from Coors Banquet.
Coors Extra Gold;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Poured from a 12 ounce can (identified as only Extra Gold Lager and no Coors about it) grabbed out from of a fairly chilled 30 pack into a 12 ounce thick glass mug. This is another 1 of ’dem ’dere beers I’ve been imbibing off and on for several years now. it works fine. Aroma: faint, far away grains and thin malts and hops but, acceptable enough to over see. It really does have a neato semi-darkish golden hue to it, from a clear glass mug, anyway. Jumping to overall: It doth good do to both pocket book and beer bud taste sensibilities. It’s a pretty simple brew, folks.
Coors Extra Gold;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12 oz. can. Pours a thin, well retained white head, over an effervescent yellow (SRM 4) body......nose is light malts, mild hops, slightly sweet, corn,balanced......taste is slightly sweet with pear, apple, corn tones, mild cereal, minimal hop bitterness......mouth feel, light body no alcohol, high carbonation, with mild acid. This is a mildly sweet version of this insipid style, and is very light and quenching. Rating below to style, above to enjoyment. BJCP 8/3/15/5/7
George Killian's Irish Red;Golden, Colorado, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle at home just grabbed since didn’t want to go dateless this Monday. Another odd one to rate so late in game. Dusty amber. Nose is caramel and fruit punch. Tastes of cherry, caramel, herbal, slight paper. Odd aftertaste.
George Killian's Irish Red;Golden, Colorado, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Tried an 8oz sample at the Coors brewery in Golden, Colorado. Pours a pale red with a white head that disappeared quick. It has a light aroma and flavor. It's a nice easy drinking beer.
George Killian's Irish Red;Golden, Colorado, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A grown up Amber. Has a very full flavor. No bitter aftertaste. A very good Amber. Perhaps one of the best Ambers.
George Killian's Irish Red;Golden, Colorado, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I haven't seen this one in so long I thought they stopped making it. Pours a dark amber with a full linen head. The aroma is floral and a bit earthy, with nuts and bread. Sipping is faintly sweet. The overall flavors are lighter, which consist of toasted and floral elements, caramel, bread, and nuts. Slight floral aftertaste. Medium bodied and chewy in texture. I considered this a premium beer back in the day. Although nowhere near that status now, it still holds up pretty well.
George Killian's Irish Red;Golden, Colorado, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Twelve ounce bottle. Pours a copper-brown. Tastes a bit sweet like honey, with a touch of bread to give it a slightly thicker mouth feel. Slight lacing and just a little head.
George Killian's Irish Red;Golden, Colorado, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Taste great. 100% a step up from your other, readily available (Coors/Bud/Heineken etc) typical bar/restaurant beers. Its nothing that's gonna knock your socks off, but for a beer that's almost everywhere, its a solid ""go to"" when in doubt!"
George Killian's Irish Red;Golden, Colorado, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12 oz bottle. Pours a red brown gold with a thin persistent off-white head. Big malty biscuity scents. Taste has a vegetal overtone off the broad but flat malt character. Some balancing bitter in the the short dry fiz finish. Above average carbonation. I don’t think it works very well.
George Killian's Irish Red;Golden, Colorado, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours reddish amber with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet malt. Taste is malty with slight hop note punctuating throughout. Palate of earthy notes. Relatively plain and sweet brew.
George Killian's Irish Red;Golden, Colorado, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Nah, a little better than Coors Banquet, slightly more roasted malty flavor, but still a very watered-down industrial beer. Even from tap, it is very mediocre
George Killian's Irish Red;Golden, Colorado, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Found from bottle. Pours an inviting red-near copper color. The appearance is the best part. The taste is below average for the style but still enjoyable in mid-Fall from time to time.
Keystone Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Alright listen up. Imma city boy and I had never even hear of this sh*t until my country ass roommate put me on. I won't sugar coat it. This is awful. overall one of the worst beers Ive ever tasted. HOWEVER. If you are A) locked up in a full day of yard work or B) just looking to shotgun some beers too pregame, Id say this is just about as good as your gonna do for a cheap light beer.
Keystone Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);473ml can (TCrBF2018) (3:2:3:2:6=1.6) Just a corny lager, both aroma and taste. Not crazily offensive, in particular compared to some of the horrors at the fest, just crappy watery lager.
Keystone Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"My favorite light ""water beer"". Very refreshing on a hot day and you can pound them. Light grain and corn aroma and taste. Rated against other beers in the same class."
Keystone Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Golden color with a white head. The light aroma is malty with grain and corn aroma. The taste is mildly sweet and thin/watery. Ok light lager.
Keystone Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Cans and bottles when I was underage, Golden color with average non lasting head. Notes are skunked lager, corn, cereal grains, and awfulness. Thin and watery
Keystone Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Have had many times before. Very bitter and only meant for consumption when looking for quantity. Still better than some of their competitors.
Keystone Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Great easy drinking beer, light in colour and goes down well on a warm day.
Keystone Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);How: Large can. Where: From Target, had at the hotel room. Appearance: Pale yellow colour with a white head. Aroma: I suppose some sweet malt . Body: Watery body, medium carbonation. Flavour: Some malt and corn I suppose and a bit sweet, but there is something that is just not good. One sip was doable, two hard, the third had to be forced and I still had this huuuuuge can to go. Just couldn't do it. A few sips rest poured down the drain.
Keystone Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Free can from Willows Liquor. Clear, pale golden appearance with a thin white head that quickly dissipates. Mild aroma of grains and corn. Similar flavor, adding mild sweetness and no bitterness. Light, thin and watery on the palate with a boring finish. Yikes.
Keystone Light;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Aroma: Not very much of anything much but a near sweet smell and aluminum. Appearance: Light gold but with watery clarity. Taste: It's really ok, really. It won't kill you if this gets drunk. It's just ok, though. Palate: Inbetween nothing and something other. Overall: Ok.
Keystone Premium;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Had this a couple times back in the day....when I drank swill in my delinquent years. I remember this much, that it could of been the worst beer I have ever had. For this reason, I am giving it the bottom of the barrel rating. Typical metallic, skunky, pee-looking grain-water. Would rather have a Busch, Old Milwaukee, or PBR.
Keystone Premium;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Substandard beer. Thin and watery with more than a little stale maltiness, mostly isn’t he aftertaste.
Keystone Premium;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Very similar to Coors Banquet, with the sweet malts/corn and hiccup causing finish. Only real difference is the alcohol is strangely more noticeable.
Keystone Premium;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);It is what it is. Really nothing special. Only good after working your butt off in the blazing summer heat. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Keystone Premium;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12 oz. can from grocery store. Pours clear. Very watered down taste. Not one I would buy again or take for free.
Keystone Premium;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"""carbonated pee-pee water. ummmmmm. you remember you’re mom telling you not to eat the yellow snow? well this is it, melted and fermented. take up a collection and buy good beer for cryin out loud!"""
Keystone Premium;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Hmmm...old notes, still worthy, here goes. When this was poured out, it was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a light yellow color with a pretty good transparency about it. The head was white and quickly fading and it left no lacing. The smell had some cooked corn/roasty hay-like qualities, fairly grassy. The taste was semi-sweet and having a sort of off burnt corn quality about it. The palate sat extremely light and was very sessionable. Overall, this just another AAL to me.
Keystone Premium;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can (Old Notes)-Pours golden with a small head. Aroma of grains and corn. Taste is very similar. This light bodied brew is not bad as I was expecting worse.
Keystone Premium;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12 oz can pours golden with a white head. Aroma of malt and grain. Taste was pretty much the same. Average macro swill
Keystone Premium;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Nastiest thing you could ever imagine outside Corona of course................
Keystone Ice;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I use to be a budlight fan, but this stuff is SO MUCH better. I love it..its difficult to find because most local gas stations only carry 1 twelve pack, I guess because it's not popular. But I LOVE IT
Keystone Ice;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);It gets you drunk. It's cheap and does the job. As far as flavor it's shit and they should try a lot harder. Everyone is going to think it tastes different so a definite answer is up to you. In My opinion it isn't your high quality beer. This is Garbage beer for cheap drunks that don't care about quality. There after the buzz. This definitely puts out as far as a kick. Taste isn't on par.
Keystone Ice;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Taste is harsh and tinny. I like Keystone Light okay but this tastes like a Keystone took a piss and somebody decided to can it.
Keystone Ice;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Served from 24 oz can into pint glass. A 1"" sudsy white head falls quickly with mild lacing. Clear pale straw with abundant streaming carbonation. Aroma of sweet malts and little else. Mouthfeel is light to medium, crisp and dry. Flavor is flat. Some malt sweet, a bit of cracker, maybe a hint of hops. Overall this beer just comes across as missing something in the flavor profile."
Keystone Ice;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Gold color with a white head. Malty with an earthiness and a corn and a slight aftertaste.
Keystone Ice;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Not the worst beer I’ve had but still this ain’t good it smells like apple juice with a hint of piss flavor wise it has a definite artificial apple juice taste overtire cheap I mean you can do worst than this but you can do a whole hell of a lot better but it’s cheap and it gets you drunk so that’s cool I guess
Keystone Ice;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Found out of can. Slightly less bitter than the light version but subject to more of the aluminum taste when out of a can.
Keystone Ice;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);24 oz. can. Hooray for 'full flavored' beer in grocery stores! Pours a clear, pale, urine color, with a big, fluffy, fizzy, white head. The nose is white bread, corn syrup, acrid pine, and wet grass. Sweet and syrupy, with a surprisingly unpleasant bitterness that I still can't get our of my mouth. Light body, with a slick, oily feel. Ugh *sigh* why did I pay actual money for this?
Keystone Ice;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);How: Large can. Where: From Target, had at the hotel room. Appearance: Light yellow colour with a white head. Aroma: Some malt, grain. Body: Watery body, medium carbonation. Flavour: Some malt and grain.
Keystone Ice;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);As a general fan of the post-Communist world's cheap, boozy, adjunct-laden lagers, it's a surprise to find that North America's can be soooooo much worse. Compared to the malty, boozy, bready goodness of say Saku Kange at a tenth higher, this alkaline, chalky, slightly banana-ish metallic vitamin-water base stuff is just terrible. Not again (24 oz can, Sayreville)

Moorhouses Pendle Witches Brew (Bottle);Burnley, Lancashire, England;Strong Ale - English;Moorhouses Brewery;In my past life, I did not think that temperature matters. How wrong can a man be. It matters. A lot! This beer was not at all good when it was chilled. Really nice a room temperature. A fine deep (dark) golden beer with a fine head. Good intensity in the flavor. At right temperature. Balanced sweetness. Pleasant carbonation level. Easy to drink. Oily texture. Toffee, dried fruits and a bit bready flavor. Nice one.

Moorhouses Black Cat (Bottle);Burnley, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Moorhouses Brewery;From Jul 2008 I got this in a trade with getkrunkhoe. Thanks Carlos! This pours a dark brown with reddish hues and a very small head of foam that leaves the scene almost immediately. Just a ring around.. the glass left but it does have a little lacing. The smell is pretty darned nice! I get some dark chocolate, some fruit, some caramel, and some roasted malt. The taste is very nice as well! Good dark chocolate with some caramel brings a sort of ying yang with the sweetness/bitterness and there's some good dark fruity flavours with a touch of plum and some toffee. The more I sip, the more I notice the chocolate and that's making this son of a gun very tasty and very drinkable. Hell, 3.4%abv....I could drink quite a few of these, for sure. It's light bodied but not as light as I thought it would be. Carbonation is close to medium, and it finishes on a slightly sweetish note. This is my first real Mild Ale and I tell you what. I am now a fan! Great style and I envy the peeps in the UK for having a lot of them to choose from.

Moorhouses Black Cat (Bottle);Burnley, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Moorhouses Brewery;No head, but some lacing. A lovely dark colur and a real hit of lightly bitter chocolate on the first sip.

New Amsterdam IPA;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Pours amber with a white head. Smells of citrus and caramel with some earthiness. Tastes earthy with some tea hints and a hint of spice on the finish.
New Amsterdam IPA;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;So, should the fact that no one has rated this beer since 9/03 worry me? Or maybe that the rating previous to that was in 5/03? Regardless here goes… Murky orange with a small off-white head. Aroma is almost non-existent. Flavor is flat semi-sweet Karo syrup. There are no hops to be found. This is not a good beer. Is this brewery is still in business? Next please.
New Amsterdam IPA;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Medium copper color with some turbidity. Fruity, floral aroma. Tasty roasted malt flavor with a bit of sweetness. Hops become more pronounced as it warms, but not to the extent of many American style IPA's. Smooth, malty finish.
New Amsterdam IPA;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Clear gold with a slightly grayish sticky head. Not much nose, but what's there has toffee notes. The description of the beer mentions Centennial and Cascade hops; don't get them at all. Very much a British-style IPA, with a toffee-butterscotch character. Finishes slightly sweet, which accents the toffee nicely. Pretty good stuff."
New Amsterdam IPA;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;copper color with a eggshell head, nice blends of sweet malt and floral hop gives this a honey character.
New Amsterdam IPA;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Nice orange body with a medium eggshell-white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Floral aroma with some honey, relatively restrained. Flavor is tame, definitely not an American-styled IPA. The sweet maltiness is more noticeable than the hops. But the hops are there, floral and slightly citrusy. Slight bitter aftertaste. Good solid body, slightly chewy.
New Amsterdam IPA;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"I suppose an English style IPA since the hop profile was a bit restrained. A very good beer overall, however. Silky smooth going down; biscuit-like malty flavor; finishes with a crisp, subtle citrus hop flavor. Another strong New Amsterdam brew!"
Paulaner Original Münchner Hell (Premium Lager);Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Bottle. Aroma- bready and grainy maltiness, maybe with delicate herbal notes. Pale, clear, with a medium-high, creamy head. Taste- not bad, feels like a Dortmunder Export. Again bready notes play the main role. On the other hand, I'm missing some hoppiness, which could counter the malty side. No bitterness. Low bodied, with a low carbonation. Simple, correct, but quite dull Lager.

The nose was soft grain, Pils scent, with slight hints of spice & pear. Light to medium bodied, with lively carbonation, the taste was similar, adding a low but effective bitterness that was grainy, and subtly earthy. A very clean & drinkable Helles.
Paulaner Original Münchner Hell (Premium Lager);Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 4.9%. Pallid yellow-gold. Decent-sized, decent-lasting head. Grassy, malty, corny aromas. Moderate carbonation. Spicy, grassy, hop-dominated lager, which makes a change! Bitterness and sweetness well balanced, with the lager malt only really making itself known in the end of the mouthful, mostly just acting as a backbone to the hops and rounding the experience out quite well. One of the best Helles I've drunk. Unmistakably a lager, and unmistakably well-made.

Sierra Blanca Nut Brown Ale;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Beer #79 of NM 100. On tap as Bone Chiller Brown. Nutty. Basic nut brown malt profile. Well balanced.
Sierra Blanca Nut Brown Ale;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Poured from bottle into English pint glass. Pours a nice dark brown color, khaki head that goes from 1 finger to a couple mm thick but never completely dissipates. Aroma is very typical of an english-style nut brown - some chocolate notes, malt, typical fuggles hop nose present as well. I’m also getting something slightly earthy, almost funky, but not in a bad way - more mushroom/earth than barnyard. Taste is also typical english brown - lots of malt, chocolate, touch of coffee, mild hop - very nutty. Carbonation level is medium, but it’s nicely prickly on the palate. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but given the style, not terribly out of whack.

Youngs Dirty Dicks Ale;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Young's;First tasted this in Gabriels, Paisley in October 1997. Cask, handpump dispense. Dark ruby red in colour with a thick white head. Strong fruit note of bramble in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Mixed malts give a fiery maltloaf base with strong overtones of tart redcurrant fruit. Spicy hop resins imparet a dry bitter aftertaste long in intensity. Finish is malty with dry vinous fruit still evident in the mouth. A decent session bitter.
Youngs Dirty Dicks Ale;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Young's;From the aroma and color of this beer from is expecting a lot from the get go. Since the alcohol is a bit lower than usual for a premium beer the flavors have an opportunity to settle on the tongue longer.

Youngs Dirty Dicks Ale;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Young's;Süßer Röstmalzgeruch, getreidige Töne nicht ausgeschlossen. Unerwarteter Antrunk, untertönig malzig, im Vordergrund steht ein vollmundig sauer-getreidiger Ton. Mit der Zeit entwickelt sich ein würziges Aroma, ebenfalls milder als erwartet. Dazu kommt eine malzige Note, die das erste Mal halbwegs die erdachte Stärke hat. Milder malzig-saurer Abgang, der zu später Stunde noch röstmalzern wird. Etwas entäuschend bei dem mehr versprechenden Geruch. Test vom 10.5.2007, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 10,10,8,9,11,9

Well balanced with a mild hop presence on the backside. Very refreshing. Light-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Short, clean, dry finish. Great Summer fruit beer!"
Valley Forge Peach Wheat;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Valley Forge Brewing Co;I'm not much for fruit beers, but this was pretty good. Peach flavor adds a nice little zing without overpowering the wheat malt. Not something that I could drink regularly though.

Valley Forge Peach Wheat;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Fruity aroma & taste, had a zing to it like a Zinfendel wine, the more you have the more the peach tones come out, probably could only have one of these at a time
Valley Forge Peach Wheat;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Valley Forge Brewing Co;A very sweet fruity aroma. Cloudy yellow in color. Clean yet strong fruit flavor - the peachiness becomes more apparent as you keep drinking. An interesting concoction but not something to drink alot of.
Valley Forge Dortmunder;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Dark gold in color. Lightly malty and clean. Highly drinkable. Nice lace.
Valley Forge Dry Stout;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Very dark, almost black, but with a reddish tint when you hold it up to the light. Thin head lasts a long time. Crisp and bitter,with nice lace in the glass. Unfortunately, surprisingly thin and light bodied. Not good for a stout.
Richbrau Big Nasty Porter;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Porter;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Dark pour with thin tan head which quickly dissipates. Chocolate aroma with hint of coffee. Flavor was more coffee and kind of bitter, with milk stout hints at the end. Decent.

Pours a clear light brown with a medium beige head. Aroma is roasty and a bit tart (infected?). Flavor is a bit roasty, but tastes more caramel than chocolate with some tartness in the finish."
Richbrau Big Nasty Porter;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Porter;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);"Sample at the ""From Russia With Suds"" tasting on 01/02/10: This brew pours brown with a medium beige head that recedes steadily. Stringy lacing. Roasted malt aroma with fruity notes. Medium, dry body with flavors of caramel malt, roasted coffee and tart fruits. The finish is roasty with a short malty aftertaste. Overall this Porter is neither Big nor particularly Nasty, especially not in the way the brewer implies on the label."

Richbrau Big Nasty Porter;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Porter;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Bottle courtesy of Mike Miller, thanks Mike. Smooth going down with a choclate, cofee taste, then the hops kick in. Decent beer. If it was a little fuller it would get my attention more.
Richbrau Big Nasty Porter;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Porter;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Bottle, #388 Dark red pour, one of the lighter porters around, with a small head. Somewhat light aroma of chocolate and roasted malt. Same with flavor. Pretty enjoyable overall.

Richbrau IPA;Richmond, Virginia, United States;IPA;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);From Jun 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with jwc215. Thanks Joe! This English IPA pours a hazy orange gold with a 1 finger head of billowy foam. There's some lacing and the head retention is very good. It has a nice nose of pine and citrus hops, caramel, and some bready notes. The taste is hoppier than I'd hoped for, considering the style. Big piney notes with big doses of grapefruit give it a pretty bitter flavour. There's some nice fruitiness here(good) and a bit of caramel malt sweetness in the background but there's not enough of it(malt) to give a real balance and that's something I was looking for. Fairly light bodied and on the higher side of medium carbonated, it finishes very much on the bitter side with a long, lingering aftertaste. This is more of an American IPA in my book so in that respect, I'm somewhat disappointed but still, it's pretty drinkable and tasty. I'm certainly glad I got a chance to try it!
Richbrau IPA;Richmond, Virginia, United States;IPA;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Pours golden amber with medium white head. Big hops in the aroma. Bitterness in the aroma gives way to citrus lemon and hint of orange. Finish is actually not too strong, interesting flavor balance.
Richbrau IPA;Richmond, Virginia, United States;IPA;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);On tap at Brewpub 6.2% Appearance: good amber , clear look , mid off tanned top. Some lace on sides.3+ Nose: clean , true fresh IPA in west coast style/ Citric – grapefruit with sweet malts.8- Flavor/Palate : Mid full bodied. Full out on high alpha hop , bitter leafy mid with slight metallic feel. Bold , bit one sided with more pronounced with time.
Richbrau IPA;Richmond, Virginia, United States;IPA;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Bottle at my refrigerator reduction tasting on 8/15/09. Bottle has a plain paper label that is less impressive than most homebrew labels I’ve seen. Starting to get worried. Pours cloudy orange with a medium beige head. Orangy hops aroma with some malt. Very orangy hop flavor (Centennial? Amarillo?) with a bit of sweet malt balance and a lasting bitter finish. Guess I won’t be judging a book by its cover again.
Richbrau IPA;Richmond, Virginia, United States;IPA;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);22oz bottle courtesy of Kevin. Pours a hazy amber with a decent sized white head. Some nice lacing. Very citrusy nose yet there is some hop earthiness as well. I am guessing Simcoe and Cascade in this one. Up front a spicy resiny bitterness with some strong grapefruit and orange peel. Finishes bitter and earthy. Very very good IPA.
Richbrau IPA;Richmond, Virginia, United States;IPA;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Pours golden amber with about an inch of head. Decent amount of hops in there as well. You can tell this is an east coast IPA. No floral aroma or much to speak thereof. Laces the glass nicely though. Medium bodied. More of an upfront bitter taste. What I hear from Maniac given the price of this stuff it’s not too bad.
Richbrau IPA;Richmond, Virginia, United States;IPA;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Growler filled by maniac. Clear orange amber with large big bubble offwhite head and decent lacing. Spicy floral hop aroma. Flavor is perfumy and floral citrus hops. Medium chewy body with moderately low carbontion, but that could easily be attributed to the growler. Bitter finish.
Richbrau IPA;Richmond, Virginia, United States;IPA;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Date: 11/2/2008 Source:Richbrau Brewery Keg from the brewery. Nice grassy citrus nose. Huge fluffy creamy head with long retention. Moderate grassy floral hops notes over pale and caramel malts to balance. Clean dry finish with moderate bitterness. Dead on for the style. Quite enjoyable.
Richbrau IPA;Richmond, Virginia, United States;IPA;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Bomber courtesy of dkachur. Pours copper with a nice white head. Smells of sage, oranges, dry malt, ginger. Tastes of pepper, spice, sweet pepper, resin, light bitterness. Excellent!
Richbrau IPA;Richmond, Virginia, United States;IPA;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Bottle from the brewery. Pours bronze colored with a small head and good lacing and retemtion. Bitter and floral hop aroma. Taste is hops (woody) with a hint of honey sweetness. Somewhat vegetal.
Kootenay Mountain Ale;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);341ml bottle pours a light brownish color with a finger and a half of off-white head that leaves some spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma is caramel with hints of chocolate and some flowery hops. Taste is light caramel and chocolate malty sweetness with a modest hop bitterness in the finish. Light to medum body with adequate carbonation leaving a nice tingle on the palate. Quite a well done brown ale that I would recommend to others.
Kootenay Mountain Ale;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);Kootenay Mountain Ale--2001 12 oz. Bottle. 5.50% ABV. (3.5 / 5.0) ESB--Clear amber red color. Mild floral slightly toasted front. Slightly earth toasted bisquit body. Earthy almost ESB fruitiness. Ends mildly New hop spicy. Tasty but off to my taste. ESB or Amber? Sampled 8/6/2001.
Kootenay Mountain Ale;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);Ah, The Kooter. This brings me back. I don’t know where they get licorice and strawberry. I got creamed corn and grains. Slight metalliic taste, undoubtedly from the can. A bit bitter. I’d only drink this to be nostalgic of Spring Break 2003.
Kootenay Mountain Ale;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);"***review from May 5, 2007*** Nice deep crystal clear copper brew with minor effervesance and a quick fizz-up / quick death cap with no lacing. The aroma is on the mild side; at least it is not offensive. The dominant smell is of the sweet lightly toasted malts. as well as a touch of fruitiness and an initial short-lived weak rootbeer quality. Taste is pleasant with notable hops that leave some spicy bite but mainly the sweet light toasted malts with a faint caramel flavour . Don’t forget a touch of metallic flavour that actually isn’t terrible. I like the bitterness throughout - it does have a nice bite to it. Mouthfeel is smooth with fine carbonation and a lasting, pleasant bitter after taste. that surges mid-sip and then gradually fades. Light to medium bodied. Good easy drinking, smooth and mild beer that I would leave on the counter for awhile to max out the flavours."
Kootenay Mountain Ale;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);"Bottle (6 pack bought at the brewery gift shop); Reddish amber, almost chestnut color, with a fizzy but kinda sticky head. Starchy to be sure and the tinny carbonation of a macro. Bit sugary. Liked it better when I tried it on tap at the brewery, but after all the fine beers I’ve been drinking for the past several hours, it’s a hard act to follow. This is a Canadian version of Shiner Bock -- a dark-colored macro lager -- sweet, adjuncty and almost corn-syrupy, but somehow still quaffable. Brown Ale? Not. (#2911, 5/17/2007)"
Kootenay Mountain Ale;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);341ml brown bottle. Deep amber colour, light tan head is fluffy and large. Aroma is caramel and just a bit flowery. Caramel malt flavours, a bit hoppy toward the finish, elements of citrus and trace metal with some toffee. Medium body and carbonation.
Kootenay Mountain Ale;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);Deep copper in color, clear and has a decent 2 finger off-white cap with moderate retention....good lacing on the glass..medium-high carbonation. Aroma gives off light berry tones over mild caramel malt and some citrus hopping. Medium to light body, slick mouth feel. Caramel malts up front with the unmistakable piney tang of Pacific NW Willamette and Nugget hops. Finish is wet where you can taste the licorice and toffee tastes which prevail over the metallic twang of the Yakima valley hops. Not really a brown ale but a NW variation. A very decent ale from a brewer most people write off as a Labatt maco brewer.
Kootenay Mountain Ale;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);Deep amber brown, thin tan head. Caramel and brown sugar aroma. Same on the palate, some malt, with a metallic tang in the finish. Not bad, but not great either.
Kootenay Mountain Ale;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);First found this beer in BAnnf, and was pleased to find it at home in Winnipeg. Was sad to drink one of my last two bottles, but it just winked at me when I opened the beer fridge.

Kootenay Black Lager;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);341ml bottle pours almost black in color with a small off-white head that leaves some specks of lacing on the glass. Aroma is roasted grains with hints of chocolate and some hops. Taste is chocolate malt sweetness with some roasted grain and mild hoppy bitterness in the finish. Light in body for the style and moderately carbonated. A decent brew, but could have been much better.
Kootenay Black Lager;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);Old Tasting Notes. Drunk in Creston, BC, Canada: Nose has coffee and mince meat. Taste is smokey bacon with coffee and chocolate. Nice mix and surprisingly well-balanced. Finish is long with smoke.

Spicy tangy toasted cherry fruit ale like body. Tangy creamy end. Rich. Sampled 8/6/2001.
Kootenay Black Lager;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);( From tasting notes dated 3/6/03)....had one of these in the Fernie hotel trekking to Vancouver on the #3....I wish this one was more widely available as it gave the best representation of a Munich dunkel we could get in Calgary before the OSB Dark was available. Poured a deep cola color with red highlights. Modest off white cap...Aroma was nearly all caramel malt with light wisps of willamette hops. Medium- light body, wet, smooth mouth feel. Toasty caramel up front, some coffee and walnut tones balanced by the NW nobles finishes faster than I’d like with a light malty sweet aftertaste. This beer is still available occasionally in draft form made for specific events and customers who sell the draft under the house name.
Kootenay Black Lager;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);(Bottle) Probably the best beer thay don’t make anymore. Typical. Nice roasty flavor that is lighter than expected. Cleanly well brewed.
Kootenay Black Lager;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);Aroma of malt, with a slight undertones of coffee and chocolate.

Kootenay Black Lager;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);Black, with tan head.Sweet malt nose. Sweet roasted chocolate malt flavor with noticeable alcohol heat. Slightly gassy
Kootenay Black Lager;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);This is a strange lager,great first taste,malted,slightly burnt yet still mild,,gets a little tiring after 3,drink in very small batches,or switch to something sour in between beers.
Kootenay Black Lager;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);This is an excellent dark beer. Exceptional flavour, don't know how it tastes after a few, but 1st was great.
Kootenay Black Lager;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);The flavour is not as dark as the colour. The initial taste disapears too quickly although the aftertaste is not unpleasant and does last a while making you want that next ounce. Not bad for Labatts.
Local Color Corporate Jims Pale Ale;Novi, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Local Color Brewing Company;"Sharp hop aroma of grapefruit-orange-citrus and floral character with a jolt of butterscotch over a tired malt base.

Local Color Corporate Jims Pale Ale;Novi, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Local Color Brewing Company;Purchased a bottle in Ann Arbor. Poured a hazy light gold with little head.

Local Color Corporate Jims Pale Ale;Novi, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Local Color Brewing Company;This is a really poor pale ale. Like a poor homebrew or something. Grainy and harsh.
Local Color Corporate Jims Pale Ale;Novi, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Local Color Brewing Company;Bottle. Not much here, somewhat watery, little hops. Maybe just a bad bottle.
Local Color Corporate Jims Pale Ale;Novi, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Local Color Brewing Company;"Aroma is slightly hoppy, somewhat similar to Molson Golden.

Local Color Corporate Jims Pale Ale;Novi, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Local Color Brewing Company;Watery, grainy and all around poor beer. The label may be the worst I've seen. No body to speak of, thin and gritty.
Local Color Corporate Jims Pale Ale;Novi, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Local Color Brewing Company;This one was just silly all the way around. Bad approach. Clean, miniscule hops some citrus. Poor.
Local Color Corporate Jims Pale Ale;Novi, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Local Color Brewing Company;I'm usually more forgiving than this, but this is hop pellet juice and water. Worse misfire than Dark Horse's Crooked Tree IPA.

Local Color No.VI Brown Ale;Novi, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Local Color Brewing Company;Okay, but not great. Weak head and typical aftertaste that lasts much too long on the back of the throat.
Local Color No.VI Brown Ale;Novi, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Local Color Brewing Company;This is better than the rest of their beers, it just has the same problems as the rest of their beers. It's uninspiring to begin with and then fizzles out way too quickly.
Local Color No.VI Brown Ale;Novi, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Local Color Brewing Company;This is the one Local Color brew that may be worth drinking. It does have some interesting roasty chocolate tones if you are patient enough to wait out the weak body.
Henry Weinhards Red;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);memory rating..fairly sweet beer...malt caramel and spices...light hop...was ok back in the day.
Henry Weinhards Red;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"""a pretty boring beer all around. another prime example of a macro-micro. a huge step up from other Miller products (as are the other HW brews) but still not worth the money."""
Henry Weinhards Red;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12oz bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a lighter amber with a small head. Aroma of malt and slight caramel. Taste of the same with some sweetness. This light to medium bodied brew is not bad.
Henry Weinhards Red;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Poured a medium orange, nose was tainted with mold and chalk. taste was thin and lacked any sweetness.
Henry Weinhards Red;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Oh Blue Boar. Poured a light amber-golden. Clear and mildly spice/malty. Pretty boring, but drinkable.
Henry Weinhards Red;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);draught into pint glass years ago. I remember nothing good or awful about this beer. It was average across the board,
Henry Weinhards Red;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Had this beer on 5/15/1999. Color is a deep brown with good carbonation but a thin head. Aroma is a sweet lightly roasted malt scent. Taste is sweet, light and clean. It starts with somewhat light body that goes down with a smooth malt flavor. The finish is a crisp lightly roasted malt flavor and light hop flavoring. It’s a bit lighter than I think good red should be.
Henry Weinhards Red;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bronze to copper in color with a wispy white head. Minimal nose with hints of biscuits and light caramel. LIght caramel and toasted grain flavors. HInts of herbal hops. I keep looking for more, but there is not a whole lot more in this one.
Henry Weinhards Red;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle. Didn’t know it was retired, still at the grocery store here. Pours amber in color with an off white head. Aroma of malt. For being so cheap it has a decent malty character, I used to think it was good which is why I tried it again with a more experienced palate. Taste very similar to the amber, and is also overly sweet. This could be old beer. I like the style of the bottle and we used to drink quite a bit of this stuff since it looked expensive but was very cheap in the thick cardboard 12 packs.
Henry Weinhards Red;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Similar to Weinhard’s Dark, but red instead of brown. Similar light malt and hop character and mild sweetness.
Young's Winter Warmer (Bottle);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);From old tasting notes. Splendid garnet red color with a creamy beige head. Small bubble carbonation. Toasted malt aroma reminiscent of baked bread. Sweet toasted malt flavor with a hint of treacle and brandy. Bittersweet finish where the hops come through. Long bitter aftertaste. Hearty to say the least. Good for the cold winter nights of London.

Youngs Pilsner;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Young's;I coulda done w/ out this brew... overly thin and grainy... a kinda crappy flavor...
Youngs Pilsner;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Young's;[i]Draught at Bishops Arms, Göteborg, some time ago[/i]. Pale golden, small head. Weak malt aroma but a fresh citric and floral hop profile. A bit watery, but quite soft mouthfeel. Good bitterness.
Youngs Pilsner;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Young's;Tap. Very pale yellow with thin film head. Aroma is mildly hoppy. Taste is hoppy as well and not very sweet. Slightly watery mouthfeel.
Youngs Pilsner;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Young's;Draught at the brewery. Clear golden with a rocky white head. Spicy hop aroma. Crisp malt and sticky hop flavor. Quite nice. Wow, either I got the one good batch ever made of this stuff or it ships extremely poorly.
Youngs Pilsner;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Young's;Draught at Calthorpe Arms, London. Golden color with creamy head. Malty nose with hints of melon. The flavor is malty and moderately bitter with herbal hop and mineral notes. Minerals and bitterness in the finish. Single-minded pilsner.

Youngs Pilsner;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Young's;Draught at the Lamb - not too bad. Golden wiht medium carbonation and a small fast diminishing head. Medium bitter nose - a bit weak fresh lemon taste, but still decent.
Youngs Pilsner;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Young's;[At the Duke of Wellington, Notting Hill, London] A light yellow beer with a white head. The aroma is primarily of citrus, combined with light notes of malt. The flavor is of lemon and malt - on a thin body. Boring.
Youngs Pilsner;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Young's;Draught. Golden coloured. Slightly hoppy aroma and flavour. Fresh and rather good.
Youngs Export;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Young's;Complete crap. I’m a fan of British beers, but this is just crap. Taste like no lager I’ve ever tasted. Strange after taste. When in London avoid at all cost.
Youngs Export;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Young's;Golden, small head. Aroma is floral and from toffee. Toffee comes back in the flavor together with some bread. Bitter finish, a good lager.
Youngs Export;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Young's;Yellow/golden, smalle head. Aroma is clearly malty from toffee and butter. Flavor is malty with floral touches. Buttery palate and a somewhat bitter finish. This was a nice surprise to me...
Youngs Export;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Young's;Young's Export Premium Lager, Keg Pale color. Undistinguishable aroma. Light taste, but with an original flowery note (elderflower). Dry.
Youngs Export;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Young's;On Tap, The Courthouse, Dartford. Slightly fuller bodied than the Pilsner with a more prounced malt presence and a better balance with the hops. Remains good tasting for longer than the Pilsner. Salty finish.
Youngs Export;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Young's;I had this side-by-side with the Young's Pilsner. This had just a wee bit more head than the pilsner, but not enough to discount the possibility of just two different glasses. Perhaps it is a faint shade darker (more orange) as well, but close enough to make no odds. You really wouldn't necessarily pick these two apart by appearance. Grassy, dusty aroma, with a pretty ugly similar flavor. At home this would have been a drain pour, but at the pub it was just the better part of a half-pint left on the table as I left. (on tap, Kings Arms, Oxford)
Youngs Export;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Young's;Sampled on tap in London. Pale, glowing golden. Thin head but tons of lace. Malty nose with a hint of hops. Very flavorful--lightly fruity, prefect hop bitterness in the finish. A damn fine lager.
Youngs Export;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Young's;Draught: I had this on tap at a pub called the Spread Eagle in London. The beer was a nice golden color. It had a little head, with not much carbonation to it. There was a slight hop aroma to it. There was also a similar mild hoppiness to the taste. This had a good bit more of a malty body than your typical lager. Very smooth. I'm guessing that it is very different in bottles than on tap, based on other reviews of this beer.

Aroma is grainy, lots of corn, sweet, light metallic. Taste is sweet, grainy, no hops. Palate is watery with med carbonation. It is what it is.
Bowes Special 7 Double Dry;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Broue-Alliance / Groupe Geloso;Can, courtesy of myself, split 4-5 ways during a tasting. Pours a clear golden with a small white head that leaves nice lacing. Nose is of fruity corn, pretty standard cheap swill. Taste is pretty weak, maybe lightly sweet and offering more corn but that’s about it. Body is light, thin and watery, corn water if you please. Overall a pretty mediocre beer, we ended up drain pouring more than half of that 12 oz can...
Bowes Special 7 Double Dry;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Broue-Alliance / Groupe Geloso;Can. Shared by mathieuc, thanks! Clear golden with a medium white head and little lacing. Aroma is of grains/corn, herbal presence, light sweetness and alcohol. Taste is less boozy, but it’s also sweet and corn forward with a little herbal presence. Light body. Medium carbonation. Bland finish. Not offensive. Somewhat drinkable. Bland and uninteresting.

The Three Stooges Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"""a thin beer that smells of cereal with a little cheap beer too. Not skunky, so not horrible, but a pretty poor beer overall. tasted like cheap cereal. great name and bottle, though!"""
The Three Stooges Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;355ml bottle pours straw in color with a finger of head which settles very quickly leaving no lacing. Aroma is light malts and hops. Taste is of a typical macro lager. Enough said.
The Three Stooges Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bought it as a joke plus the single bottle was dirt cheap. You get what you pay for. Pale yellow lager. Funky malt nose and taste. Rated 2/3/2000
The Three Stooges Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;This beer is getting some low ratings, however, I’m going to have to go against the grain a little on this. The beer I had is of unknown vintage, and unknown storage conditions. However, it was really not bad at all, the beer was very sweet showing almost all malt character and very nice caramel notes. There was very little hoppiness which could be due to being older. I also did not detect a whole lot of oxidation. Not bad at all, but not great either. Definately drinkable though and worthy of a fair rate.
The Three Stooges Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Unbeknown to me, this was sitting in a friend’s fridge for several years. Perhaps it was the age, but this tasted like a bock, having a strong malt presence and smooth finish. Would like to try a fresh sometime.
The Three Stooges Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;(bottle - 12 oz) Had this one quite a while back but never rated it. Clear gold color with a very thin white head. Smells like a beer pretty much. Some dry hops and grass mixed with some malts. Flavor is pretty much the same. Dry hops mix with some hay and corn near the beginning and ends with a slightly dry and bitter malt and hop finish. Kudos to the awesome package though.
The Three Stooges Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bought a case to frame for the bar. Bad beer but great pictures. Buy the case and keep the cardboard and bottle caps. Pour the beer in the sink.
The Three Stooges Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Just a plain american macro tasting pale lager, that is sold in a gimic six pack. Each cap has a different Stooge face, whoopie.
The Three Stooges Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bought this for the label (see, marketing sometimes ropes us all in). Pours pale straw with some fizziness. Smells of creamed corn and skunky. Tastes watery with a stray hop or two. Basically Coors Light with a cool label.
The Three Stooges Beer;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Oh man I hate to do this. This beer is VILE, second only to that Birra Morretti crap. I love the 3 Stooges, how could this be sold in their name. I had to pur it after one sip. I can’t possibly describe it in terms of beer, maybe isopropyl alcohol with some finger nail polish remover (acetone) thrown in. Never again, sorry Moe, Larry, Curly.
SLO Olde Highland Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;SLO Brew;Had this beer on 5/2/1998. Color is a medium golden brown with light carbonation and very little head. Aroma is a sweet fresh malt scent. Taste is like liquid ass. It starts off with a light creamy body that goes down cool and smooth. The finish is where this one kicks you’re ass with a heavy malt flavor that is full of some weird smoke flavoring. Its just bad.
SLO Olde Highland Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;SLO Brew;Amber color. Roasty, husky flavor and aroma. Bartender said it wsas like Guinness but was not close - more like a 80 Schilling with some roasted notes.
SLO Olde Highland Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;SLO Brew;a carmelly malty & smokey aroma lifted from the bronz..pretty solid smokiness and very malty w/ some carmel sugariness..pretty good for the style..whatever that may be..but doesnt do it for me...some sweetness in the very end with smoky carmel in the aftertaste
SLO Olde Highland Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;SLO Brew;Decent Scottish style ale, not as rich and complex as actual Scottish examples, such as Belhaven or Traquair House. Lighter in body and lighter in flavor. Still it had a clean malty flavor.
SLO Olde Highland Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;SLO Brew;"Amber Ale, Slightly stronger than the Garden Amber. It has a spicy, smoky flavor- i.e. a scotch ale &#8211; finish is light"
SLO Olde Highland Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;SLO Brew;Nice amber color and decent aroma but the body was lacking and the flavor was not altogether there for a Scottish ale, not enough smokiness or sweet chewiness. Guess they're not bottling this any longer?
SLO Olde Highland Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;SLO Brew;I can see how this can be a favorite for some. It's got some subtlety if you're patient. I found it had sweetness in the aroma that didn't carry through to the taste. For scottish ales, I'm looking for a bit of sweetness to taste balanced by peat, tobacco, and/or wood flavors. This had mild examples of both of these poles and though it had some texture and subtlety, it didn't have enough of what a Scottish ale means to me. Imagine Moylan's Kiltlifter on estrogen.
SLO Olde Highland Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;SLO Brew;Definetely one of my favorites. The hops are present, but not overstated. Good blend makes it a smooth yet engaging brew. whats slo stand for anyway.
SLO Olde Highland Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;SLO Brew;A decent beer, nice malt nose and a fair hop finish, quite clean tasting....

Atlantic Coal Porter;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Porter;Atlantic Brewing Company;Not as bitter as a typical porter, but it is dark as any porter and tastes like a ’typical’ porter,
Atlantic Coal Porter;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Porter;Atlantic Brewing Company;Pours basically black with a decent sized khaki head that settles to a thick fine-bubbled ring and film and leaves some walls and spots of lace.

Lighter bodied, active, a bit oily and slick, finishing somewhat dry with woody, earthy hops.

Grisette Blanche;Le Roeulx, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie St-Feuillien / Friart;Aardig en niet bijzonder, weinig uitdagend maar redelijk vol in smaak. Typisch witbier, iets zuurder, maar naarmate je drinkt ontplooit het graan palet zich. Weinig substantiële kraag.

Grisette Ambrée;Le Roeulx, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie St-Feuillien / Friart;An hazed dark amber ale with a thick big bubbled off white head. Aroma of caramel malt and oxidation. In mouth, a sweetish malt with light fruity esters, ripe apples, and surprinsing hoppyness, compared to other Grisette. Some lactic points developping. Medium bodied. BB 26-10-06. Bieropholie private order.
Grisette Ambrée;Le Roeulx, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie St-Feuillien / Friart;25 cl. bottle. Amber colort with a small white head, Aroma of caramel, fruits and malt. Flavour is sweet and malty.
Grisette Ambrée;Le Roeulx, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie St-Feuillien / Friart;Bottle. Amber colour with a small white head. Fruity aroma and flavour of hops and very watery.
Grisette Ambrée;Le Roeulx, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie St-Feuillien / Friart;Hazy amber with a small white head. Sweet fruit and yeast aroma: really very nice. The taste is dull and watery. There’s a lot of fizz and some subdued sourness and bitterness.
Grisette Ambrée;Le Roeulx, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie St-Feuillien / Friart;Nicely lacing head which leaves large sheets of off-white foam around the glass sides. Otherwise, the pour is totally clear and of an earthy caramel color. Smelling, it does feel rather shy and unexpressive, leaving an impression of cerealic grains, some perhaps underfermented malts comprising a good dose of residual sugars, yet not managing to give anything resembling a caramelly suggestion. In mouth, it feels surprisingly hoppy compared to the other grisettes. A good slicing herbal/leafy aromatic combination does give the impression of increased dryness. The bitterness remains unagressive, imparting a slight lagery character, though the carbonation is obviously too creamy, if active for that. Slightly vegetal aspects, but I can’t say they don’t intermingle nicely with the bready and herbal notes. Simple and approachable beer, but you’re not gonna lift any hearts with that one.
Grisette Ambrée;Le Roeulx, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie St-Feuillien / Friart;Bottle. Nice cloudy amber body topped with a decent off-white foamy head. Fair malty/hoppy aroma with herbal notes. Taste is dominated by hoppiness. It also carries some oaky hints. Ends with a decent bitter finish. OK, but not impressive.
Grisette Ambrée;Le Roeulx, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie St-Feuillien / Friart;Bottle. Nice head but it fades right away. Color is amber. Decent aroma of caramel and malt. Taste is sweet and a bit acidic.
Grisette Ambrée;Le Roeulx, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie St-Feuillien / Friart;(25cl bottle) Purchased through the Bieropholie/SAQ importations. Pours a quick dissipating white head with a hazy, orange amber body. Nose of mild caramel malt and slight whiskey barrel. Flavour of a full palate of caramel malt and thin corn finish. Fairly plain by comparasion and overly malty. Could use some counter balance.
Grisette Ambrée;Le Roeulx, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie St-Feuillien / Friart;Bottled. Light amber coloured. Uncleaer. Dense beige head. Sweetness, yeast, fruity, light spice in the aroma. Flavour is fruity and pruny. Has some cocoanotes. Yeast detectable again. Is a bit thin and bland. In a way its quite perfumed.

Grisette Ambrée;Le Roeulx, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie St-Feuillien / Friart;25 cl bottle. Yeast at the bottom. Amber colour with a weak head. Aroma og caramel, toffee and someway little nutty. Flavour of toffee, sweetness and hints of caramel. Not a beer for me.
Silly La Divine;Silly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie de Silly;The beer has a taste that matches its aroma, not right. It's easy to drink and finishes well. Surprisingly it doesn't leave an aftertaste equal to its initial flavor.

Shipyard Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Wheat Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;Not too shabby, a 3.5... got it in the bargain bin @ Griffs in Watertown, NY. I noted Rochester listed on the label under the micro location, subbed out to Gennesse?
Shipyard Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Wheat Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;This is actually my least favorite of the Shipyards that I tried...close call between this and their Pumpkin. In the middle of my summer brew sampling phase, and this beer is one that I probably won't try again or miss. Thinkin I prefer more towards the Kolsch and Pilsner styles, or a golden ale even...over an American Wheat. The flavor seemed a little rustic and bitter, but not in a good hoppy way. Everything else is pretty much average.
Shipyard Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Wheat Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;Can at the cabin, NH. Pours mostly clear gold, effervescent, with a foamy white cap. Pretty inoffensive stuff, basic bready-doughy law malts, mild bitter straw, hints of citrus. Light bodied with average carbonation. Sweet finish, more pale bread, hay, lemon rind. Simple, enjoyable.
Shipyard Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Wheat Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;Pours a clear golden color with a head the disappears quickly. Aroma of wheat. Taste is watery, almost no flavor.
Shipyard Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Wheat Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;Floral aroma that comes off especially strong from the head. Taste and palate are similar to that of an IPA, the floral notes contained within the beer are its defining factor. A little harsh on the tongue for an ale but that’s ok.
Shipyard Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Wheat Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;Aroma is a bit weak. Taste is just your bland malty light beer. Overall just OK.
Olde English 800;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Initial tasting notes: Rich, malty with notes of sewer rat. Quite similar to a Newcastle that had gone warm and had homeless bathe in it for a few weeks. Carbonation was apparent but did little to improve the drinkability of this thick drunk nectar. A few sips in the taste started to improve. No longer could taste the homeless who chose to cleanse themselves and get inebriated at the same time. By the time I finished the first, it reminded me much more of a crisp coors original. By this time the tape around both my hands was slowly cutting off circulation so drinking these rockets of awesomesauce helped ease the pain. The second was pure gold. 10/10 would recommend to a friend. This should not be drank without one being taped to each hand.
Olde English 800;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours wan clear yellow with a white head. Weak aroma is malty, that's it. Malty flavor has a hint of apple. Texture yields so-so fizz and body. Well, had to try it.
Olde English 800;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can from Hell's Kitchen Brewtique, Manhattan, New York (July 2, 2019). Better than expected - no taste of alcohol. Similar to the basic US lagers. I see now why this might be an option if you want to get drunk. Well, I'm glad this the regular big can not the gigant size bottle.
Olde English 800;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Backlog, decided to add all my gross macro beers i have had over the years. Golden color. Notes are cheap perfume, sweet malt, and ass cracks. Rough finish.
Olde English 800;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Clear yellow color. Thick white head when pouring in a glass. Great for Edward 40 hands (well used to be before these plastic bottles they sell now). Anyways.. Has a bad metallic taste mixed with what I can assume eating straw would taste like but since I’m not a goat I can only assume that’s what it taste like. Overall it’s not terrible and let’s be honest, it does what it is designed for, cheap malt liquor that gets you drunk. Nuff said.
Olde English 800;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);As the great dave chapelle said when he was playing Samuel Jackson in a beer commercial, it'll get you drunk, you'll be f***ing fat girls in no time, you might even fight a ni**a or two, mhmm mm bi**h. Out of the cheap malt liquors its actually semi-tolerable, I'd rank it behind a Mickey's. Flavor is okay, doesnt have that bad of an aftertaste.
Olde English 800;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"16 ounce can into lager glass, best before 5/2019. Pours fairly crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Some fruity corn aromas, but not too overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 5.9%. Overall this is a nice malt liquor. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and pretty refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. Very clean and nicely rich pils malt/grain showcase, with nice earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Not too overwhelming on adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable offering, and impressive style example as expected of Miller."
Olde English 800;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);42 oz. plastic bottle. Pours a medium, off white, well retained head, with slight lacing, over a clear gold (SRM 5) body.......nose is mild malts with corn tones, slight grassy hops, balanced......taste is mild malts with hints of corn sweetness, minimal hop tones, very slight hop bitterness on the finish, balance to the hops......mouth feel, light body, no alcohol, high carbonation. This is a very, very simple beer in both aroma and flavor and somehow comes toward the stated style. BJCP 5/2/5/4/5
Olde English 800;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Gotten past the age where I will have this again. It's straw yellow and tastes awful. Certainly only for quantity drinking.
Olde English 800;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);24 oz. can. Why do I keep doing this? Clear, pale, yellow color, with a big, frothy, white head. The nose is honey, straw, bread dough, and a bit of vanilla. Very sweet, with hardly any bitterness. Smooth and easy. I've certainly had worse.
Santa Fe Wheat;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Santa Fe Brewing Company;This is a light, weak tasting beer. It has that nice white, wheat appearance, with the internal bubbles, but it has a weak head and is overall lacking in taste and character.
Santa Fe Wheat;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Santa Fe Brewing Company;notes: Has the adequate banana clove aspect to the nose and flavor, but is a little too light on the palate to be that great. An ok sessionable brew, nothing more.
Santa Fe Wheat;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Hazy gold pour with a fairly small white head. Not much happening beyond sweet, wheat and citrus but not bad at all.

Santa Fe Wheat;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours hazy light orange with a one finger snow white head. The nose is sour wheat and light citrus. The taste is wheat, grain and light lemon zest. Medium, semi-prickly mouthfeel. Kinda boring, but nothing offensive about it. Refreshing yardwork beer.
Santa Fe Wheat;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Santa Fe Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Clear golden yellow. Thin white head. Sweet wheat malt aroma. Heavenly floral hop aroma. Flavor is a bold wheat malt character. Dry and thirst quenching. Some lemon zest. Some banana. Just a touch of clove. Very well done. What I’d expect a Wheat Ale should build up to be. Very enjoyable. 23 may 09
Santa Fe Wheat;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Appearance: Lightly hazy, yellow body with a frothy, white head. Smell: Very faint nose with only small notes of malted wheat, and even lesser touches of banana and spice. Taste: Lightly tangy malted wheat taste with a fair amount of sweetness gives way to flavors of banana cream pie filling, light lemon, and even lighter spice. Subtly spicy, lightly bitter hops. A few more hints of banana cream, though more cream than banana and a dull, earthy spice accent. Smooth, drying finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Medium-low carbonation. Drinkability: Reasonably decent, but it comes up waaay short in the nose. I was going to say it’s a treat to beat the Santa Fe heat, but at 65°F it’s cooler there than it is in Georgia. So, I guess it’s a decent wheat to indulge in on a fairly pleasant, lightly breezy Wednesday afternoon.

But in any case, I made a point to pick up a 6-pack of this while passing thru NM. This is a nice light amber color. The aroma is rich -- malty and toasty. What follows is a nice caramel-sugar flavor, with a sense of New Mexican baked corn? It’s never as good as you remember, but this was better than most."

Silly Saison;Silly, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie de Silly;Bottle, 330 ml. Dark brown colour, moderate CO2. Smells caramel, apple, christmas spices on the nose. Sweet forest fruits soaked in carameln light biscuit, low IBU, kind of a dessert beer with low alcohol content. It's also citrusy on the palate, so the concept os like sweet notes on the nose and on the palate also, but undertoned with a citrus aromas. Man, i would be very confused on this one on blind.

Otter Creek Copper Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Otter Creek Brewing;Bottle. Pours a copper color with a thin off white head and a bit of a haze. Sweet malty aroma. Malt comes through at the beginning with a some citrusy hop at the end. Balance seems quite good. Its okay, somewhat forgettable but a nice change from the hop bombs populating the scene.

Otter Creek Copper Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Otter Creek Brewing;Bottle from Candia Road Convenience Store. Aroma is mix of bready malt and yeast. Appearance is gorgeous clear copper color (go figure) with beautiful sparkling, one finger frothy white head that dissipates to ring and foamy lacing. Taste is weak and has nothing up front but lightly sweet back end. Palate is light and thin with nice light carbonation on the tongue. Finish is inconsequential. Overall, I’m not sure you’re going to find a nicer beer to look at. But, it’s almost like OCB put all their eggs in this basket and forgot about the other attributes. Not much to recommend it otherwise.

Very clean lager. Slight floral aroma. Nice balance with hops and malts. Nice dry finish. Same style and very, very similar taste to Long Trail Ale. Between this or LT Ale, I think I enjoy LT Ale by a little. I probably couldn’t pick out each beer from each other in a blind taste test. I think Altbiers like this and Long Trail Ale are great beer-beers. Nothing crazy, nothing too intense, good balance and great tasting. I don’t drink a lot of Altbiers, except for LT Ale and OC Copper, but these are solid beer.

Otter Creek Pale Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Otter Creek Brewing;This pale ale is pretty good and uses my favorite hops from the northwest, but they could ramp it up a little.

The smell has good roastiness to it with strong chocolate notes. The taste is of roasted malt with a bit of chocolate up front and some hoppy bitterness comes through near the end but the finish is actually on the sweetish side. All of the flavours I mentioned are on the light side so this is one very smooth American Porter. I'd say, give it a try.

The aroma and flavor have roasted malts, sour coffee, earthy, thin, a strange combination, I noted that I would never drink this again and I was right.
Otter Creek Stovepipe Porter;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Porter - Smoked;Otter Creek Brewing;"Originally rated on 12/10/08. ""A slightly above average porter, stovepipe poured a very deep amber almost black body, plenty of carbontion but not much head or lace. Mouthfeel was a little thin and slightly bitter. Aroma and taste were standard with hints of toasted malts, some chocolate and coffee. O.k. but not great."
Otter Creek Stovepipe Porter;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Porter - Smoked;Otter Creek Brewing;First experienced on tap at Mad Mountain Tavern, this porter convinced me, in a good way, that there was soot in the recipe. One of my all-time favorite porters, it’s with great sadness that I learn it is no longer being produced. For that matter, MMT is closed as well. So goes the impermanence of life I suppose.

Otter Creek Mud Bock Spring Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Otter Creek Brewing;"$5 for 22oz bottle ----Otter Creek first got my attention with their jamaican-style stout appropiately called ""Otter Mon."" The sweet malts are given me chocolate, carmel, and some nut. The hops come through on the aroma, but I can’t really detect them on the tongue. My rating is not off the charts, but I do like the taste and lingering chocolate finish. This one is a maybe buy again."

Creamy off-white head that fades to a thin layer and leaves some lace. Aroma is nutty, woods, some chocolate, some dark fruits like raisins and dates, a bit of vanilla. Flavor is a bit strange. Almost chalky, maybe even a bit oxidized &#40this is a spring release being consumed in the fall... thats not enough time to oxidize is it?&#41. A bit of chocolate and nuttyness, but the astringency seems to override most of the beers ""character"". Meidum body with medium carbonation. Overall: not horrible, but the aroma set a standard that the flavor simply didn’t follow through on."

Pours dark brown with a ruby hue, capped with a medium sized tan head. Aroma is quite sweet, with notes of cereal grain, caramel, cocoa, and lucky charms marshmallows.

Pours a dark brown body with ruby-red highlights and about an inch of short-lived light tan head. Caramel, chocolate and a bit of nut characterize the aroma.

Otter Creek Mud Bock Spring Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Otter Creek Brewing;Bomber - Pours a dark copper brown in color with a medium light tan head that settles to a thick coat over the beer and produces some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is slightly sour and fruity with plenty of roasted malts and a few hops. Flavor is much more sour than I would have expected. Little of the other flavors transcend the sourness. Quite disappointing...
Otter Creek Mud Bock Spring Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Otter Creek Brewing;22 oz. bottle shared by Tmoney99. Pours a deep caramel copper color with a small off white head. The aroma was semi sweet with fruit, some roast, caramel malt, and floral notes. The flavor opened with a sourness that was quite unexpected. Nothing from the nose really made it to the taste. It was thin and not something I would care to revisit.
Otter Creek Oktoberfest;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;Direct pour at the brewery. Comes out dark copper with a pure white head. Exactly what I expect from a good Oktoberfest. Feel like I got this too early in the season. Very young mouthfeel as it is July and the beer is new to tap. Perfect lacing.

Otter Creek Oktoberfest;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;Transfer from BA review on 10-13-13- Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a crystal clear orange-amber color with a one finger pure white head. The head fades over about a three minute time period to leave a good level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma was of a roasted malt smell with a light caramel and toffee sweetness. Along with these smells are some light earthy and herbal hop aromas. Taste – The taste begins with a roasted bready flavor with a bit of caramel sweetness. The sweetness increases toward the middle of the taste with the caramel growing stronger and some other light fruit flavors coming to the tongue. Flavors of a grassy and earthy nature come to the tongue at the end, and with the sweeter flavors increasing a bit, a moderately sweet and toasted malt flavor is left to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the average side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that was on the averages side as well. Both were nice for making a rather refreshing and easy drinking brew overall. Overall – A nice drinking oKtoberfest. Nothing super exceptional, but good none the less.
Otter Creek Oktoberfest;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;It has a hazy appearance with a medium orange amber colored body. The head is just off white in color, small and fades quickly to a light ring of lace. There is a mild aroma of sweet bready malt with an odd ginger like spice and earthy dried leafy hops. It has interesting malty character with some caramel roasted flavors mixed with buttery sour dough bread notes and dry yeast. Hop flavor is in good balance and adds leafy and mildly spicy hop flavors which quickly fade off in the finish. It has a smooth texture, average carbonation and a good medium body.
Otter Creek Oktoberfest;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;Reviewed from notes. The appearance has a dark copper colored body and left a one finger white foamy head, some nice ringy lacing was left around the sides of the glass. No carbonation was seen rising. The smell seemed really off, bland and muted caramel tones with some light nuttiness to it. The taste was basically the same. The palate was a light to medium with nothing harsh on the tongue, sessionable. Overall, I’m not that impressed with this beer. I’ve had better Oktoberfests and this isn’t one of them. I won’t seek this out again.
Otter Creek Oktoberfest;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;Bottle at home.

Otter Creek Hickory Switch Smoked Amber Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Otter Creek Brewing;bottle. Bottled 09/21/01. Aroma: BBQ potato chips, malt, and a bit of caramel. The aroma makes me a little apprehensive about how this is going to taste. Appearance: Very dark red, almost bordering on brown. No head to speak of. Flavor: There is a little hickory smokiness, but the main flavor is malt roastiness. A little bit of caramel flavor...and not much else. Flavors are weak. Palate: Medium-light bodied and watery. Carbonation seemed a little low, as well. Overall: Not good. I’m hoping the fact that this bottle is a couple years old has something to do with it. Weak, watery, and without distinction.
Otter Creek Hickory Switch Smoked Amber Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Otter Creek Brewing;tap at RFD. more roast than smoke...very much not a rauchbier style, which is what i was expecting. black, slight head. medium body, malty flavors balanced mostly by acrid roast. pretty mediocre.
Otter Creek Hickory Switch Smoked Amber Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Otter Creek Brewing;Dark redish brown hazy with a thin head. The aroma is malty with a bit of caramel and a smaller bit of smoked and an even smaller bit hickory, so small in fact, I dont smell it. The flavor of this is also just not good. It lacks anything consistent to make a taste interesting and has a funny aftertaste. The only other smoked ale Ive really has was Rouge’s....which was like 8 years out of date. And it wasnt much worse, it even smelled better.
Otter Creek Hickory Switch Smoked Amber Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Otter Creek Brewing;The concept of a smoked american amber ale sounds good. Too bad this beer does not deliver what its name promises. Watery think weak and a little metallic. Not the best beer I've ever had. Flavor evaporates. which is good and bad.
Otter Creek Hickory Switch Smoked Amber Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Otter Creek Brewing;"Medium-brown, medium head, clear. Smoked sausage aroma is quite nice; flavor on the other hand is quite dull. Smoke present all the way through, but thin and bland and the smoky bitterness isn''t counterbalanced by much of anything. Fairly watery; not OCs worst, but I''m really glad I got just one bottle for under $1.50; I don''t feel TOO ripped off."
Otter Creek Hickory Switch Smoked Amber Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Otter Creek Brewing;"I don't get it. I keep trying this, keep hating it and yet keep trying it every fall. The smokiness is just unsettling, maybe because of the Hickory in lieu of say Beechwood. Just gives it too much ""burnt kielbasa"" flavor. The malts aren't bad they are hidden and only evident when really warm. I'll try it again next year."
Otter Creek Hickory Switch Smoked Amber Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Otter Creek Brewing;Good Gawd, this stuff is awful! I have never had a respectable import like Kaiserdom, but I am sure it is better than this. Tastes like a bad bock beer with liquid smoke drops added to it. Regardless, the stuff is a good seller.

Otter Creek A Winter's Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;The body has a dark appearance with good clarity and very deep brownish amber color. On top there is a huge light tan head that has great retention. It lasts all the way to the last sip slowly fading down to thin cap along the way. Also it makes for some cool splotchy lacing on the glass. The aroma has notes raspberries and rich lightly roasted malt. The base of the flavor is a sweet, lightly roasted malt with light buttery, bready and raspberry that adds a little tartness. Hop flavor is very light and understated. It has a solid medium body and its carbonation is light on the tongue with a smooth almost creamy feel.
Otter Creek A Winter's Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;Draft. An average winter ale. The aroma was a pleasant malt scent with a bitter finish, and the appearance was a medium brown with a decent white head. The palate was a medium body with a bitter, crisp finishing texture, and the taste had a similar bitter finish to it. Malty caramel notes complimented by dry bitter and a touch of hops.
Otter Creek A Winter's Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;Picked up the new winter seasonal from otter creek a raspberry brown, sounds interesting. Pours a dark reddish brown with a stingy beige head that dissipates quickly to form a cap. Smells of vanilla some brown sugar and a sweet fruitiness that I guess could be raspberries. Slight chocolate aroma as she warms. Taste is meh. I found the raspberry to be forward up front and a bit artificial. Think Sam Cherry Wheat but not as bad. There’s a tartness midway through each taste. There’s some brown sugar and sweet malts in the background of a beer that finishes quite dry. Medium body and carbonation with a syrupy/watery mouthfeel. This reminds me of a raspberry wine cooler and ex girlfriend used to drink. If you mixed it with Newcastle you would get this beer. I didn’t really enjoy this one much.

Legend Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Legend Brewing Company;Clear gold pour. Better than your standard swill for sure. Crisp and clean with a nice refreshing bite. Not a standout in the craft world, though.
Legend Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Legend Brewing Company;On tap. Pours a clear light orange with a thin white head.

Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);"I'm with the ""this is a good but forgettable stout"" crowd. Not sure to call it a sweet or dry, but I'd say more on the dry side. The chocolate malt and oat flavors are there, with a semi-creamy texture from the oatmeal. Roast coffee and burnt molasses/sugar give some bitterness. I certainly would not turn this down, but not seeking to buy again. Has potential though. Could see it being better fresh on tap."
Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);02-May-15 (12-oz bottle: Sample bottle from the distributor) This is an Oatmeal Stout that I last sampled in 1998 and I thought it was pretty bitter back then. It pours a dark-brown body with caramel edges. The tan head rises to half an inch before settling to a thin ring and patchy dusting. The nose is noticeably roasty and significantly burnt for an Oatmeal Stout. And on the palate, burnt, very dark-roasted malts dominate, but there's still quite a lot of oatmeal flavor, some dark chocolate, and grassy hops. It's not very sweet at all, and yeah, roasty and hoppy bitterness is readily apparent, so maybe I wasn't so far off back then. The beer is medium-plus in weight, medium in carbonation, and quite dry on the palate. Overall, this is more roasty that I like for this style, but it's still enjoyable for a dark, roasty stout.
Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);12 ounce bottle. Pours dark brown with an average tan head. Aroma of malt, coffee, and chocolate. Taste is roasted malt, dark chocolate, and coffee. Mild bitterness. Thin body. Ok.

Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);23 oz. bottle pours a translucent dark brown with creamy beige head that leaves some lacing. Aroma is all roasted barley, with mild coffee and mild chocolate. I couldn't detect the oatmeal. Taste is initially sweet and malty but the finish is bitter, Body is at most medium with soft carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. OK, but not one I'll return to enthusiastically.
Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Good stout kinda sweet. Refreshing sipper. Would go good with a smoked meat.
Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Creamy flavor and creamy texture. Light body. Malty. Mild coffee (despite claim of boldness). This should be a sweet stout and not regular stout.
Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Roasted barley aroma, black color. Pretty standard. Taste is too dry for me, expected something sweeter from an oatmeal stout, haven’t found signs of oat here. Body is watery with quite acrid rough aftertaste coming from hops probably

Midnight Sun Kodiak Brown Ale;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Brown Ale;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;0.355l can. Definitely a brown one in color, little cloudy and a tall almost fluffy but somewhat fading beige head that leaves minimal of lacings. Smells mild chocolaty. Tones of nuts, dark berries and some darker types of malts. Nice and not too extreme aroma. It has a somewhat high carbonation level wrapped in a mild oily texture. Tastes quite good. Again it’s mild chocolaty with a nice dark caramel sweetness. The high carbonation is kinda disturbing the flavors a tad perhaps. There’s hints of truffles, marzipan and red berries in the finish. All in all its definitely a little dull, but drinks nice enough. 24.06.2015

Midnight Sun Mammoth Extra Stout;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Bottle: Pours a deep brown body topped with a thick brown head. Fizzy at first, but creamy and lots of thick lacing. Nose is an intense coffee, roast, and cocoa blend. Roasty and nutty flavors, light cocoa and some faint bitters. Lots of carbonation, more than desirable, imo. The good thing is a heavy finish of roast and chocolate that brings a seemingly creamy feel into play and helps get past the bubbles. Interesting.

Midnight Sun Mammoth Extra Stout;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Bottle served in a pint glass. Pours black with a good sized brown head. Good retention and nice lacing. Straight stout goodness. Not overly complex, but it is balanced and tasty. Light coffee, cocoa, roasted malts and resiny hops. Mid sweet, medium body and a long roasty and hop bitter finish. If they put this in a 6-pack it would rival the best stouts out there and become a commercial success.
Midnight Sun Mammoth Extra Stout;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Bottle, age unknown. Pours black with a bit of yellow/tan head. Aroma is faint coffee, cheese rind. Taste is hard to describe. Some sweetness from the malt, though its’ more about the chewy texture than the flavor as far as the malt goes. A bit of the hops coming through. Weird interplay with the two. Undecided. Will update once I’ve had another go-round.

Midnight Sun Old Whiskers Hefeweizen;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Bottle:   Dirty golden, pale haze, moderate white head, frothy, fairly decent lacing.   Faint banana, clove, and bubblegum.   Not too shabby in the nose department.   Better than most American examples.   A little more mealy than wheaty on the tongue, but does retain some clove and banana.   Not too heavy, a little lighter.   At least not as filling or heavy as many German examples.   Seems fairly clean, exit is balance between wheatiness and a mealy sort of flavor.   Some dirty ice water like flavors linger tho after the finish.   You know, kinda like sucking on an icicle thats hanging off the roof, yeah that.   Its actually better than I expected though.

Erdinger Pikantus;Erding, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Erdinger Weissbräu;Bottle at home, brought at Waitrose. It's the best of the Erdinger range so far!

Gordon Biersch Blonde Bock;San Jose, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);I didn't know this was 7%. Felt light, but this is what I wanted actually. A nice, smooth, lighter, blond/golden ale. Finding all of Gordon's brews to be fairly solid. Decent hop finish. Semi-clear appearance...tiny bit of cloudiness. Sampling this brewer one beer at a time, but this is something I'd grab a 6-pack of.

Gordon Biersch Blonde Bock;San Jose, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);This is an okay Bock, but leaves a little to be desired. Could definitely be smoother to drink compared to similar beers. Overall, a decent value at most places you go
Gordon Biersch Blonde Bock;San Jose, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Dark gold with coppery tones and a small white head. Rich malt aroma, very much like a German bock. Sweet with a bit of an astringent bitterness fighting for dominance. Not a smooth balance. Too bitter of a finish for an otherwise well done bock.

Aroma is bready, malt syrup, some honey, floral and slightly metallic. Taste is sweet then medicinal / vegetal bitter like some ancient elixir, but not the kind that gives you immortality and thus worthy of the Ill-fated Eternal Drain Pour.
Gordon Biersch Blonde Bock;San Jose, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Draft at San Jose airport. Husky grainy aroma. Faint floral. Clear dark gold with head that quickly dissipated to a collar and dusting, but there is nice patterning down the sides. Tate is moderately astringent with moderate high bittering. Slight alcohol warmth is nice. Really a bit rough and lacking rich maltiness that this style demands.

Gordon Biersch Märzen;San Jose, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Decent all around beer. Second sample from Gordon, and finding them both very drinkable. One of the better semi-economy brewers. Grabbed a few different varieties that I haven't tried on clearance for 1/2 off. One of them is the Festive Ale/Oktoberfest, so curious to see how it differs from this. Light amber color, clear appearance. Smooth mouthfeel. Flavor is mostly caramel malt, but good hop finish. The clearance was because these bottles are almost a year old....but still taste sort of fresh....definitely not spoiled. Liked their maibock, liked this....eager to try the blonde and festive ale next.
Gordon Biersch Märzen;San Jose, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);"Ehhh....nice pour, carmel with 2"" white head, which looks great in glass, especially at an airport spot.

Finish is lightly bitter with a light balancing touch of faintly noble hop back-end that still leave a faintly lingering caramel sweetness on the aftertaste. Not a bad example of a Märzen

Gordon Biersch Pilsner;San Jose, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);This is for the Naptown pils in GB Annapolis. Nice low Saaz aroma with pils malt. The grassy astringent flavor overcomes the rest and make the experience underwhelming. Seems Jim the Brewer is blind to grassy flavors.

It pours a deep reddish brown color, a bit hazy with a tall light tan head. The aroma is full with sweet cherries and red fruit. Light notes of raisin bread and malt. The flavor is a bit disappointing with some metal, light molasses and raisin bread. There’s some cherry cola sweetness as well that lacks depth. It ends on a dry, toasted note. The mouthfeel is pretty thin and fizzy. Could have used a richer mouthfeel and more flavor development.
Gordon Biersch Dunkles;San Jose, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);750ml bottle with a swingtop. Pours a slightly hazy roan brown color with a bif foamy beige head that has good retention. The aroma is soft with sweetened malts and grains.

Gordon Biersch Dunkles;San Jose, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Bottle from Safeway in Los Altos, CA.

Gordon Biersch Dunkles;San Jose, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);A decent beer, nothing too special, but smooth and tasty. Pours a beautiful ruby red with a thick white head. Smells malty, maybe a bit of marzipan. Taste is creamy, sort of empty upfront, with some coffee and toffee coming in, and a lingering sweetness on the tongue. Had in the bottle.
Gordon Biersch Dunkles;San Jose, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a very light brown/dark copper color with an amazingly huge billowy off white head. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading to leave a lighter level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – A big caramel and brown sugar aroma are the bulk of the smell. These are mixed with some nice roasted malt and toasted aromas as well as a little bit of a nutty smell. Rounding out all these is a very light earthy and herbal hop as well, creating a very pleasant aroma overall. Taste – The taste begins with a sweet brown sugar and caramel flavor with a little bit of a toasted malt and a light grainy taste. The grain and malt are very light, largely being dominated by the sweeter flavors of the brew, which intensify even more after the initial taste with some other sweet flavors of a cola and molasses nature coming to the tongue. A little bit of a nut flavor develops right after the initial taste, with it then fading away toward the end due to the advent of the cola and molasses. Just a hint of herb is mixed into the taste leaving one with a very sweet, lightly roasted, and thin flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is quite thin with a carbonation level that is high. A thicker body would have certainly been better for accentuating the roasted and nut flavors of the brew and would have made it a bit less cloying. Overall – A little too sweet in darker sugar flavors with not quite enough malt and roast to really support the sweet. A bit sweetly unbalanced.
Gordon Biersch Dunkles;San Jose, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);750 Swingtop from Bine and Vine. Pours cola color with a beige head - though with lots of light behind it, it’s dark ruddy copper. Warm dark malt aroma. Med body, maybe. Flavor is lightly chocolate, a little darkly malty. Maybe a bit yeasty in the finish. Not much bitter in it. Enough flavor to make it an interesting beer.

Gordon Biersch Maibock;San Jose, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);First sample from Gordon. Maybe a little better than expected. Was not sure if this is true craft or just restaurant brew gone commercial. Still not sure, but the beer is decent. Would not be upset if I got this on tap in Vegas or New Orleans at one of their restaurants. Been seeing 6-packs of Gordon Biersch distributed here, but wanted to sample one or two first. The price seems right, so based on the first sample I am sold. As far as this beer goes, on the lighter side for a bock...almost like an Oktoberfest. Good caramel flavors with a little hops at the end....just enough to notice. Not much aroma. Smooth feel. Nothing really special, but overall above average.

Gordon Biersch Hefeweizen;San Jose, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);"Draft to rocks glass at GB SFO. Looks good for the style; a cloudy/yeasty darker papaya with eggshell head that steadily dissipates into lacing.

Gordon Biersch Festbier;San Jose, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);These samples were from last season, thus the half off clearance sale. I didn't notice a difference really. Haven't tried this beer fresh yet, so would get this again based on curiosity. Found this to be one of the better domestic Oktoberfests out there. Was liking Sammy's, but wasn't that much into this year's version so sampling different brewers in this style. Found this beer smooth on the mouthfeel, flavor is decent and well balanced....maybe a tad on the sweet side but typical of this style. Light to medium orange appearance. Finding all of Gordon's beers to be decent so far.
Gordon Biersch Festbier;San Jose, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Mediocre, not bad, not great. I like all the German styles brewed here, vs. nothing but IPAs, this one was heavier on banana than clove.

Gentle Bens Red Cat Amber;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gentle Bens Brewing Company;Poured up at AZ Strong Ale Fest 2014 where they told me this was an imperial red ale but it very well might be the Red Cat Amber so I’ll put the rating there. It pours with a nice clear deep copper body that has some golden hues and supporting a light tan head of foam. The aroma offers up some pine hops mixing with some malts and a touch of citrus. The taste comes across a little thin and drinkable with tasty hops that run from flavor hops right into a decent level of hop bitterness. I’m getting mostly grapefruit as well as a little bit of pine and then a mixture of sweet fruity esters along with some sweet crystal malts. Pretty nice all-in-all with just enough going on to make it interesting amid the light drinkability.
Gentle Bens Red Cat Amber;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gentle Bens Brewing Company;Closer to brown in color, this was the last beer I had on the 4th of July and it didn’t work with all the others. It just felt too malty and little off.

Gentle Bens Taylor Janes Raspberry Ale;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Gentle Bens Brewing Company;Was concerned that this would be a radler. Thankfully, it’s not.

Gentle Bens Taylor Janes Raspberry Ale;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Gentle Bens Brewing Company;Draft at the pub years back.

Mickeys Fine Malt Liquor;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);After all these reviews I noticed I never did a malt liquor. They didn’t have any 8 ball so I grabbed mickeys instead. Obviously it’s not good but I was able to slam it down. Only hints of funk. It will get you drunk! Pretty sure that’s why the style exists cheap and will get you bombed.
Mickeys Fine Malt Liquor;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Smells very fruity and flowery, tastes kinda light and sweet.

Mickeys Fine Malt Liquor;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);24 oz can, Chicago.

To be avoided or at least not sought out, indeed, though for different reasons than expected
Mickeys Fine Malt Liquor;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);24 oz. can. Very bubbly. A pale, sickly color, and a big, dense, frothy, white head. The nose is mostly corn syrup, with some indistinct hops, wet grass, and bread dough. Sweet and sugary, with a very light bitterness. Light to medium body, with a syrupy, sticky, and very effervescent mouthfeel. Pretty easy and smooth, but not exactly good. And I don't have anyone to blame for this but myself...
Mickeys Fine Malt Liquor;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This is the type of bottle that you throw at a cop's head. Paper bag never required, always preferred.
St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;This is a backlog rating from 2011 from a can, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are sweet, grainy, corn, why?
St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Man, this one brings back memories. Remember those classic commercials? Taste wasn’t as good as Old Gold, but MAN did it have some kick! Haven’t seen it on the east in at least 15 years, but it’s a must try if they still make it. Tasted like a stronger PBR with an aftertaste. Not for everybody, but I enjoyed it.
St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Aroma and flavor is sweetish malts/corn and a mix of alcohol and nasty in the finish.
St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;16oz can thanks to crossovert Pours clear straw golden white a small white head that dissipates quickly, some lacing.

St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Originally rated on 11/1/07. Ah memories.. quick cheap buzz beer. Taste is about what you expect, not the worst for H.G. malt liquiors.

St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;"I love a good punishment beer; clear 40oz bottle into pils glass because I’m fancy yo. Bubbly clear pale golden color with ample white head. Aroma notes of grainy pale malt sweetness, corn flakes and faint grape soda; not offensive but not that great. Taste adds more corn bready sweetness almost and faint cardboard-like/grass bitterness. Light-medium body, heavy-moderate carbonation, crisp, tad sticky with light sugary-corny finish. Best drank very cold, best thing I can say is it doesn’t drink like 8.2% ABV. Overall a below average malt liquor."
St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;"Finally cracked my 40 of this the other day, after sticking it in the freezer for about 30 minutes. The initial swig is awesome, no damn corny sweetness, but a harsh, coughing bite of flavor. You can taste, smell, hear(?) the alcohol in this street malt. At first the taste was met with my disapproval but after I was 1/4 through this, I fell in love with it. I actually recommend not putting this one in the freezer, fridge temperature is more than adequate. I gave the palate 5 stars, allow me to explain: despite the initial ""burn"" this beer grew on me really fast, until I loved it. I instantly wanted more. And not just cause I was drunk."
Coors Winterfest;Golden, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);From Oct 2005 Poured from the bottle, it formed a decent head that lingered for a while then settled into a fine partial layer. The smell of this deep gold brew is pretty malty but not all that exciting. The taste is a decent balance of hops and malt with the malt lingering in the aftertaste quite well. Overall, a good product from Coors that doesn't exactly titilate the taste buds but *is* quite drinkable. PS: This is the first Winterfest I've seen for many years. If memory serves me well, the first editions of this product were much more complex.
Coors Winterfest;Golden, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);From old tasting notes. Brilliant Amber orange color. Foamy white head.

Coors Winterfest;Golden, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Old rating...tastes like being back from college during Christmas break and playing foosball in a friends basement. Slightly sweeter, maltier, and less corny than coors. Still not good.
Coors Winterfest;Golden, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"The 30th Limited Edition of Winterfest; numbered 81596/263520 and as the label states ""in celebration of the holidays"" and ""Sold only in Colorado"". I recall when it initially came out. This one’s much, much, much better. I’d not tried any Winterfests for several years and thought WTF, give it go and recalling the 1st Winterfest batch had that ""Colorado Kool-Aid"" after taste. Recommended; nice light-brownish orange coloring; a refreshing taste. Looking forward to 2015’s batch now."

Slight raisin undertone and toffee.
Coors Winterfest;Golden, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);December 21st, 2014 - With bottle 185153 out of 263520 I feel a little less special than most limited runs might, but good beer is good beer, whether stuck behind a scarcity gate or bursting off of grocery shelves. Winterfest, from Coor’s higher end brewing arm, is a healthy looking auburn brew with tines of carbonation running up my tulip glass, pushing a slightly sweet, honey-ish scent, with a background of malt. The palate is as active as it looks, so I leave it to settle, which reveals some light golden ale notes, but with a clean, clear lager finish. It’s a bit too light, and certainly doesn’t feel seasonal, but the delicate touch might work better for hotter days. March 1st, 2012 - I appreciate tradition, though as a student of history I often read how dangerous or ill-advised it can be. Nevertheless, pedigrees and homages to distant origins fogged and then burnished by marketers strikes a chord with me, which is why I couldn’t help but put a bottle of Coors’ Winterfest in my holiday sampler pack. It’s a Cocker Spaniel brown color, with a thin tan head. Notes of nuts and corn give the aroma most of its character. A powerful carbonation masks the foretaste, which then slowly advances towards a light flavor with pilsner malt and a faint nutty aftertaste. Overall the flavors are light and even a little wan. 6/3/6/2/12/2.9
Coors Winterfest;Golden, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This was the first beer that I couldn’t finish. Tastes like a mixture of dirt, sawdust, and soggy bread. Horrible mouthfeel, leaves you wanted to get the stale taste out of your mouth.
Coors Winterfest;Golden, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle poured a clear redish-amber hue w/ a quickly diminishing fizzy white head and some lacing.

Erdinger Weissbier;Erding, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Erdinger Weissbräu;500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5.3%. Average-ish, so-so-lasting head, poured carefully mind! Light orange colour, but prevented from being genuinely pale by how murky it is - very. Citrus aroma with rusky wheat which develops in intensity. Moderate-medium carbonation. Initial spritz of orange-citrus hops, then monstrous thick-bodied wheat flavours. If you want wheat in your wheat beer, this delivers, with the hops, normally perhaps quite noticeable for a weissbier, here having their work cut out to shine a light through the thickness of body, and just about managing, cutting through every so often when needed. If you've had weissbiers and thought they didn't deliver the wheat, Erdinger has you covered here. Thick, almost frothy mouthfeel. Only hints of that classic banana yeast though, likewise for the other fruity flavours that a really good weissbier can show - they're there, just about, but this one's really wheat-focused. Lovely, thick, creamy and smooth, especially when the carbonation dies down a little. Perhaps not the most flavourful of weissbiers, but there's no duff flavours in here on the other hand, and it certainly delivers the wheat flavour and mouthfeel, while being decently hopped.

Erdinger Weissbier Kristall;Erding, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Erdinger Weissbräu;Bottle from Waitrose. It's a nice beer. But it's a wheat beer that has transitioned into a lager. It's ok, but a little boring. A little flat and uninspiring. Looks, aroma and taste are of a nice clean helles larger or pilsner. It's fine, really. But come on.....

Erdinger Schneeweisse Winterbier;Erding, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Erdinger Weissbräu;Erinnerte mich anfangs zunächst an die Kuchlbauer Turm Weisse. Mit 5,6 % ebenfalls recht hoher (allerdings nicht ganz so extremer) Alkoholgehalt. Recht fruchtige (insbesondere etwas Grapefruit und Limone), leicht getreidige, sämige Note. Der Hopfen kommt auch nicht zu kurz, auch wenn er erst hinten raus voll durchschlägt. Erfrischend und süffig (trotz reichlich Kohlensäure). Ein interessantes und wohlschmeckendes Bier. Man muss aber sagen, nach 2 Halben am Stück ist es auch gut und man macht sich dann lieber was anderes auf. Nur im Winter erhältlich (und dann auch nicht überall) - und dann hol ich mir auch wieder ein paar Flaschen davon.
Erdinger Schneeweisse Winterbier;Erding, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Erdinger Weissbräu;500ml bottle into a Franziskaner Weissbier glass at home on 13th Sep 2019. Hazy dull golden body, full white head with carbonation bubbles rising to replenish it. Not the pronounced banana and clove esters/flavours you usually get from German Hefewiezen, but it's a lovely, boozy version, very pleasant in deed and now one of my highest rated beers in this style.

Pours clear mahogany with a small head. Aroma ripe fruit, raisins, some hops. Sweet with a hint of alcohol. Tears of joy drip into the glass. It's like suckling the tit of a fair maiden. Staring hard at the perfect figure of the female form. The farm party suffers a land slide loss and the beer gets even better. The Finnish Women's hockey team win the world championship (it was a goal) and it gets to orgasmic levels. Sadly I have to go to work tomorrow. Not Bad.

AleSmith Blarney Stoned;San Diego, California, United States;Brown Ale;AleSmith Brewing Company;Brown and cloudy with a sweet candy-like chocolatey aroma with hints of mint leaves and nuts...the flavors were a medley of minty hops and a nutty malty toffee-like chewiness...in sum, toffee candies and mint gum combine in a nicely hopped nutty brown ale with a buttery toffee feel to it and notes of mint popping out everywhere...
AleSmith Blarney Stoned;San Diego, California, United States;Brown Ale;AleSmith Brewing Company;Damn was I glad to finally get a shot at trying this fine beverage. Dirty brown color with some nice moderate head, and it really looks like there is some grey in the color, but would that even be possible. Had a malty, nutty, even some peanut brittle in the aroma. The flavor followed right up the ass of the aroma, only a little bit more of the nutty notes. Damn good combination, I thought it would have some caramel in it, but i could not find it. Actually smelled like a payday.
AleSmith Blarney Stoned;San Diego, California, United States;Brown Ale;AleSmith Brewing Company;very nice. sweet, caramel/toffee/nutty flavors predominate, eventually leading to a nice, somewhat dry finish

I have tried this one off cask and keg and both were fantastic. very well balanced beer in all aspects. the flavor changes in your mouth from slight spice to smooth, sweet maltiness.

OCCASION: coming down after a thrillingly improbable finish to the Vikings/Saints game... GLASSWARE: Hop Devil nonick... pours a dark ruby red body, murky and foreboding--too dense to see through... the thick, creamy off-white head sits like a velvet cake frosting, and it laces like a stormy sky, and plateaus as a two-finger mesa--attractive! Immediate resin, spruce, and earthy malts leave the best impression; secondary scents of toasted malts that suggest soon-to-be-born bread, a little yeast funk, and some vegetable... traces of citric aroma, but not as much as expected... a creamy, frothy, breathy ale that is smooth, soft and extremely drinkable--nothing dead here, though a bit of butter accompanies the finish... a lingering, pleasant experience.... the flavor is resin, mango, peach, and light pine... the caramel promised is secondary, with the sweetness blunted by vegetable and toasted bread malts... I like the overall experience, with its creamy comfortably encouraging the next sip, and each sip lacking a bite at a middle-of-the-road ABV... ultimately, a beer that probably pairs with Autumn well; here in January, it stands well but not out--other ambers have been maltier, sweeter, hoppier.... this does enough to be in the second tier of that conversation..."

AleSmith Evil Dead Red;San Diego, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;AleSmith Brewing Company;Strong toasted wood and molasses aromas along with equally strong hoppy notes from a crystal clear dark amber body with a reddish tinge. The taste is immediately sweet toffee and dark caramel quickly followed by a rush of green grassy and pine hop bitterness that balance each other and also fight each other for dominance. In the end, they do reach an equilibrium and settle to a woody aftertaste with a lingering bittersweet chocolate note. This tastes like a bigger beer than it is and it's one delicious monster. Happy Halloween!

AleSmith Nut Brown English-Style Ale (Bottle and Draft);San Diego, California, United States;Brown Ale;AleSmith Brewing Company;It's a brown ale, if you like browns you should know what to expect. I'm not going into aroma, flavour or whatever as this is another from Ryan Smith, a name always worth looking for and once again bringing a welcome touch of US craft to the handpumps of the UK-wide Spooneria beer fest. Compared to the ubuitous corporate sugar sludge-pit known as Newcastle Brown (and some indie UK browns, sorry) this is great. It seems daft that once again a US brewer has taken one of ours and turned it into what it should be and maybe once was. And that's coming from a man with a preference for hoppier, paler beer varieties. We have great indie companies in the UK but many US breweries are genuinely better with flavours and ingredients. So why can't Alesmith Nut Brown be permanently available? Because it's got 'stuff' in it, that's why. Costs money. Or maybe it's just had more care put into it, either way is fine by me. So come and set up over here Ryan, we're behind you. And if you need someone to look after the UK marketing, Fat Carlo has the stomach of a concrete rhinoceros...
AleSmith Nut Brown English-Style Ale (Bottle and Draft);San Diego, California, United States;Brown Ale;AleSmith Brewing Company;Surprised to find it in the Spoons Fest.

Angel City Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Angel City Brewing Company (A&S Brewing - Boston Beer Co.);Bottom line is not inspiring and probably last time I would drink this beer. The beer is a hazy orange-amber coloring with a thin film of head. Aroma is flowery, with caramel notes in the background. Overall, the nose was a bit muted, and the flavors seemed a bit watery. Very light bodied beer. There were slightly sour malt flavors with flowery and citrus sweet highlights. Slightly sour, again, on the aftertaste, and a mid-lingering finish. A little weak for the style in terms of body and flavor.
Angel City Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Angel City Brewing Company (A&S Brewing - Boston Beer Co.);Brilliant amber color/ fleeting head. Nutty, caramel, pine aromas. medium bodied with soft co2. Decent malty sweet bread, nutty caramel flavors.

Somewhat sweet malty aroma. A hint of hops as well. Fairly crisp and malty. Good hop character. Somewhat grainy for an amber. Pretty tasty though. I’m glad to see they got rid of that sour cream flavor.
Angel City Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Angel City Brewing Company (A&S Brewing - Boston Beer Co.);On tap. Creative name. Color was a dirty amber. Aroma was fruity and bready. Flavor was like HI-C punch, which was quite bizarre. Some yeast and mineral water as well. Very strange, but not terrible.
Angel City Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Angel City Brewing Company (A&S Brewing - Boston Beer Co.);Okay, nothing really to write home about. Subtly hoppy but not over the top. Decent mouthfeel, but underwhelming, just kind of an average decent drinkable, but not noteworthy beer.

Angel City Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Angel City Brewing Company (A&S Brewing - Boston Beer Co.);Pretty decent beer, would like it a little more if it had a bigger finish, it just drops right off of the palate.

Angel City IPA (-2013);Los Angeles, California, United States;IPA;Angel City Brewing Company (A&S Brewing - Boston Beer Co.);20-Feb-08 (22-oz bottle: Purchased 19-Feb-08 for $3.29 at BevMo in La Jolla, CA) So here we are two years later, and having been assured by the brewer that bottling issues have been cleared up, it’s back on the shelves. So, here goes a little quality control... This is what you expect from a West Coast IPA: big, bold and full-flavored with significant punch from hops. Moderately bitter, piney and a little citrusy, the hops are certainly not shy, but there is still sufficient malt backing to keep the beer nicely balanced. The malts tend to show a little graininess in the finish, but the beer well-attenuated, keeping sweetness levels in check. The nose is fairly grainy, but unfortunately, the hops don’t really project much aroma, and the beer smells a little soapy. Medium in body with ample carbonation and a long, crisp, dry finish. Golden in color with slight haze, the beer is capped by a tall, fluffy, off-white head that settles to a thin layer. The head leaves a very impressive, dense, ringed lacing down the entire length of the glass. Overall, the aromatics could use a bit of work, but this otherwise is a very solid IPA has nice flavor, superb balance and looks great in the glass. 21-Apr-06 (22 oz bottle: $3.49 at BevMo in La Jolla, CA) Okay, so when you’re drinking a west coast IPA, but the hops is completely overpowered by off-flavors, you know you really have a problem on your hands. Unlike the infection in their Dunkel which contributed a significant sourness, this is just massive diacetyl. But just like with the Dunkel, this beer smells and tastes like rancid fruit, though here, it’s extremely unpleasant. Really not much point in writing much more, but a beer this brutally awful, so obscenely polluted by off-flavors, has to be put on the record. And I’m gonna talk to my manager at BevMo and get this pulled off the shelf. It should also be noted that this beer was kept cold the entire time because I stuck my bottles in the cooler as soon as the driver delivered them (and he came straight from the brewery, early in the morning). A definite rerate is in order, but not until the bottling line is cleaned up. (2, 3, 2, 2, 2 = 1.1)
Angel City IPA (-2013);Los Angeles, California, United States;IPA;Angel City Brewing Company (A&S Brewing - Boston Beer Co.);Hazy medium brown, no head. Old oxidixed hops, burnt malt. Flavor much the same, past its prime. Dissapointed.
Angel City IPA (-2013);Los Angeles, California, United States;IPA;Angel City Brewing Company (A&S Brewing - Boston Beer Co.);Very bad IPA. Pours a golden amber with thin white head.

Angel City IPA (-2013);Los Angeles, California, United States;IPA;Angel City Brewing Company (A&S Brewing - Boston Beer Co.);"On tap; for the style this is scraping the bottom of the barrel.

How can I like there pale lager better than the IPA?"
Ballast Point California Amber;San Diego, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);One of those forgetable brews. Average all around. Balance is ok, a tad on the rusty side. Typical caramel malts, etc. I am thinkin that I just prefer brown ales over ambers, so naturally these styles get lower ratings from me. Glad that I sampled a single, b/c I wouldn't really want a 6-pack of this.
Ballast Point California Amber;San Diego, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Pours a reddish amber color.

Ballast Point California Amber;San Diego, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);"(Bottle) The hoppiest beer I've ever seen marketed as an ""amber ale"". The commercial description references an ESB, and although I'm getting a little bit of this, it's also hoppier than any ESB I've tried. I like this, but not when I think of it as an amber ale. Aroma has a good balance of malt and hops. This is also a very malty beer and the malt has a sort of depth to it. There's a hint of fruitiness which I found very welcome. Quite sour. Bitter throughout; has a bite and leaves a bitter aftertaste. Slightly metallic quality mid-sip. Like most of what Ballast Point makes, this was a very complex beer with a lot going on. It is not easy drinking though: if you like IPA's I'd imagine you'd like it, but if you want something more like a typical amber ale, I recommend steering clear."

Leffe Vieille Cuvée;Leuven, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Bottle from Beer Supermarket. Aroma started as farty vegetable but moved into classic Belgian strong / Leffe. Still some fart remains. Mahogany colour. I generally am not a fan of Leffe due to its strong sicklyness but this is just disjointed for me. Sickly sweet leffe with too much booze chucked in. Moments of niceness but overall doesnt work for me.

The aroma has sweet malts, bitterness and fruit, with notes of apricot and more bitterness. The taste is fruity and bitter, but there's something artificial about the sweetness that I can't put my finger on. The aftertaste is dry, but sweet. Too fruity and bitter for my tastes.

Leffe Brune / Bruin / Brown;Leuven, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);I went into drinking this with the lowest expectations. As predominantly a real ale drinker, I'd been left thoroughly unimpressed by the Leffe Ruby offering, which tasted like very cheap, bad, alcoholic Ribena, and smelt far worse to boot. It was my first try with any Leffe beer, and regretted it. So, I cracked open this bottle of Leffe Brune/Bruin, which I'd bought at the same time as the Ruby version. First of all, it looked and smelled better. A lot, lot better. The traditional beer type smell gave me some confidence that I may actually enjoy this drink. Whilst I find it difficult to detect any scent from most beers I drink, at least this one didn't smell repulsive like Leffe Ruby did when I took a whiff of that. Nor, thankfully, does it taste repulsive, either. In fact, it tastes rather good. It's slightly more carbonated than say a British real ale, but this isn't a bad thing. It doesn't taste overly carbonated or fizzy, and keeps a good head once poured, all the way down the glass. It has a fairly rich flavour, with mild burnt chocolate notes with some subtle fruitiness. It's definitely not a bitter taste, but has some body and depth behind the flavour. Really pleasantly surprised by this. So much so, I would buy this again.

Shipyard Brown Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;On tap. It poured a brown color with a tan head. The aroma was of toast, malts and bread. The taste was similar to the aroma with more toast, malts, bread and mild carbonation with a mild mouthfeel. Ok.
Shipyard Brown Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Brown Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;I bought this in the captain's collection variety pack. I'd say it was my 2nd favorite in there so far.....with the Blue Fin Stout being the best. This was pretty good for a brown ale. I had a variety pack from them years ago, but forgot the details so waited til now to review. I'd say this is one of their better ones. Has a darker brown appearance but not super-dark. Smell is a little yeasty, sort of like those Dutch Brown or European ales. On the lighter ABV% side, so has some good malty flavors (caramel, chocolate, etc.)....but a decent bitter hoppy finish to it. Can also taste that yeast as well which adds some flavor. I bought a single brown ale from Smutty to compare it to, and curious to try Sammy's Brown Ale as well. But this is something that I would buy again because the price is right.

Buona all’assaggio, sapore di malto, un po’ di caramello, piccole note di cioccolato, amaro quasi assente se non appena nel finale. Molto beverina visto il corpo molto leggero, il basso grado alcolico e la carbonazione minimale. Non da ricordare, ma si difende.
Shipyard Blue Fin Stout;Portland, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Shipyard Brewing Company;I like the new label better than the old one.....picture of a Marlin or Tuna on the front. This was my favorite of the Shipyards that I sampled so far. Lots of chocolate, decent amount of coffee, nicely hopped. This almost reminds me of a porter. I would buy the variety pack again just for this beer, as I haven't seen it in 6-packs yet. I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite stouts, but for just over $1 a beer, I'd say for the price really can't be beat.
Shipyard Blue Fin Stout;Portland, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Shipyard Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 4/20/2016. Pours clear opaque dark brown/black color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky tan head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts.

Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, and toasted dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of nuttiness, smoke, char, herbal, grass, pepper, dark fruit, and roast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and light fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, and toasted dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of nuttiness, smoke, char, herbal, grass, pepper, dark fruit, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/grassy hop and roast/char bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toasted dark/brown bread, nuttiness, light smoke/char, herbal, grass, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a great roast/hop bitter/sweet balance, and zero acrid/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from hop/char bitterness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is a delicious dry stout. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful for the low ABV. Nicely rich English pale/roasted malts, balancing hops, and mild fruity yeast characteristics. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."

Shipyard Blue Fin Stout;Portland, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Shipyard Brewing Company;355ml twist off (Still?) bottle. It is overcarbed, but if it wasn’t it would be a fine looking beer. Cola/bronw color and a large tan head. Aroma is typical dry stout, bit of coffee, bit of cocoa, bit of metal, grain, leafy hops, oxidized licorice. Surprisingly not heavily oxidized as this bottle is about a month past it’s BB, the havy carb might help. Flavor is predictably metallic, fruity though, some oxidation in a sherry form coming through, licorice and coffee, huge carb. It tastes like the stale English imports from years back, they’ve done a good job imitating old english brews with this one, maybe i should try it fresh and properly carbed someday.. It’s nothing to behold.
Shipyard Blue Fin Stout;Portland, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Shipyard Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours black. Aroma and taste are light roasted malts and coffee flavors.
Shipyard Chamberlain Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;Another brew sampled from their Captian's Collection variety pack. I'd say that I like this tied for 2nd with their Brown Ale...with the Blue Fin Stout coming in at #1. This would be a daytime or starter beer for me, or something to come down off a heavy dark. On the lighter side, but has some decent flavor. Mostly caramel malts and some mild hops at the end. I guess I would try this again since the price is right.
Shipyard Chamberlain Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;I got this 12 oz. bottle from a beer club along with three other selections. Pale ales typically do not thrill me and that carries over here. It has a decent pour, a medium yellow liquid and a glorious, strong, bright white head. The smell is grain, dough and a metallic tone. The taste, well, still grainy and some kind of astringency. You try a new beer and sometimes it works and other times it does not.

Shipyard Chamberlain Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;Pours an amber from a bottle, thick white head. Aroma of caramel malt. Not much going on here, except unlike many pale ales the overall mouthfeel is well-balanced. However, little hoppiness, and an over-reliance on caramel malt. Meh.
Shipyard Chamberlain Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;Orange brown with thin tan head. Fruity, butter, hops, malt, toffee in the nose. Malty with notes of butter, grass, hops and toffee. Firm dry bitterness.
Shipyard Chamberlain Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;Bottle - Malt forward with some good hop backbone. Pretty basic and one dimensional taste. I will say it stand up to my cigar that I am smoking with it which is nice.
Shipyard Chamberlain Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;Distinctly mediocre. No head. Little malt and curiously bitter for ABV. Not true to type.

Shipyard Fuggles IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;(Bottle, 0.5 l - BB 30.09.2020, from a Sainsbury's, 20191015) The beer poured deep golden and clear. Its head was medium sized and white. Aroma had grass, sweetness and malts. Palate was medium bodied with medium carbonation. Flavours were grass, sweetness, fruitiness, malts and bitterness. Aftertaste was sweet and bitter. A decent pale ale.
Shipyard Fuggles IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;I found this to be a below average IPA. Balance wasn't really working too well for me. Overly bitter, but not a good hoppy way....more like the metallic semi-swillish kind. First sample I thought it was OK, but on the 2nd try I wasn't feelin it. I found some others in the Captain's Collection variety pack to be worth the try, but not this one. I'll stick to my Bell's Two Hearted Ale, Lagunitas, Sierra Nevadas, etc. when looking for affordable IPAs
Shipyard Fuggles IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;"fantastically hoppy and crisp beer. picked up a whole case of this once marked as ""damaged"" and had piles of it in the fridge for ages. i remember it well for its dark fruity flavours mixed with the zingy, citrus hop burst. deceptively strong/medium strength too."
Shipyard Fuggles IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;Bottled 0,35L. Dark orange color, hazy aspect with good bubbly and short head duration. Soft yeasty and hop aroma, notes of wood and something sweetish malt. Medium prickly mouth, a little bit smooth taste with modest bitterish and unbalanced final.
Shipyard Fuggles IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;Tried this on 2-18-09 the bottle says best before 5-08 so... It pours a slightly cloudy amber orange body. Thin off white cap disappated quickly and left some lace. Aroma and flavor was mostly of caramel malts with the bitter hops showing more in the mid and after taste. Overall it was fairly decent, but i wouldnt mind trying a fresh bottle

Shipyard Fuggles IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;"Drank from a pint glass, poured from a twelve ounce bottle. Not loving the aromas from this brew, (I’m not an IPA guy, but love me some Fuggles!) Would have thought ""Malted Wheat"" would have made this brew a bit more hazy. But I don’t think I would consider this an IPA, not hoppy enough, brewed 3 months ago, but the fuggles shouldn’t have died out that quickly, needs some more hop oomph to be an IPA. All in all, not a bad brew."
Shipyard Fuggles IPA;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA - English;Shipyard Brewing Company;Pours a nice orangish color. Aroma is grassy hops. Flavor of a classic pale, big grassy hop flavor.

Victory All Malt Lager (Dortmunder);Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);All Malt Lager is styled after a classic German Export, a style made famous in the city of Dortmund. Export is a very drinkable, tasty beer, which falls some where in between a Helles and and a Pils. It has a just a touch more malt character than your average Helles, but is a little less hoppy then your classic German Pils. Balance is what defines this beer, and Victory’s example is one of the best domestic examples of this style you will ever taste. It is brew with with 2 row German malts, and whole flower German hops, and comes in at 5.2% abv. Victory All Malt Lager pours to a beautiful, bright, deep golden color, with a bright white head that fades, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic with a very pleasing, spicy/grassy hop aroma. The plate on this beer is so crisp and clean, with really great pale malt flavors, with a smooth, round body. Victory All Malt Lager finishes with more crisp malt character up front, then ends with a quick and snappy, grassy hop bite that balances this beer out to perfection. It is the simple, yet elegant character of this beer, that makes it such a wonderful beer to drink.
Victory All Malt Lager (Dortmunder);Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Poured an effervescent amber with a fizzy white head.

Victory All Malt Lager (Dortmunder);Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Bottle, from New World Beer. I’m guessing that this is the Dortmunder as it has no dating on it and by my taste is closer to others description, anyway. Good nose, fruity and sour. Lemon, popourri spice kinda thing. Orangy gold color got a decent amount of sediment, little to no head. Bitter flavors, tart. Kinda lambic ish, cherry, lemon, hay. Thin body, lite watery mouthfeel, tart dry finish. Interesting brew, not what I was expecting. Not that much into Dortmunder/Helles so I’m a little unsure of this.

Spaten Oktoberfest Ur-Märzen;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu (AB InBev);"Best before May 2020. Good thing I looked at the reviews; I didn't realize that I hadn't reviewed it yet! It pours a lovely clear amber with a very healthy looking head of foam. Smells of bread, caramel malt, some grassy hop notes. Excellent balance imho. Bready malt, grassy hops, working in unison. Sip after sip, a true joy to drink. Light sweetness, which is overdone in quite a few domestics of the style. Not too hoppy, again, I've tasted that in some domestics. Simple, tasty, done right. Smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel. I haven't seen this very often in Casper. This was part of a mixed case of the Premier Lager and Optimator Doppelbock. Cost me around $34. What a bargain!"

Pours medium amber with light tan head that is not persistent. Aroma clean, caramel very light hopping. Taste is dry, light bitterness, sweet malt, clean finish. Not a lot going on here but clean, well made and drinkable (just ordered a second, if you’re counting). The Germans know how to make drinkable beer. The caramel distinguishes this from their Helles in a good way. I love the fall ... leaves turn color, the air turns crisp, Spaten Oktoberfest shows up, yada yada yada.

Laser Malt Liquor;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);These folks speaking ill about Laser are nothing but corporate shills being paid by big beer to distract you from the fact the perfect beer once existed in this dark and lonely world and it was called Laser. Don’t listen to these naysayers for they know they’re lying. They just sold out and they have to live with themselves. I, however, will be butt naked at Walmart drinking the last 40oz Laser in existence when the rapture comes. Hallelujah!
Laser Malt Liquor;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Alcoholics do not even like to drink this swill. It looks like week old pee and the appearance is the high point of the experience. Last time I saw this it was 89 cents.
Laser Malt Liquor;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I used to drink this when I was underage and lived in Green Bay in the late 90s. Don’t really remember what it tasted like too well (I wasn’t as picky back then). But it was cheap and I loved the label. I wish I could find a t-shirt.
Laser Malt Liquor;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Hey, it was 99 cents back when I was in college for a 40.

Laser Malt Liquor;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This beer is AWESOME and tastes like robots and puréed kittens. Nice lingering finish.
Laser Malt Liquor;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);back in college, a friend and i discovered ’Laser’ in a dimly lit convenience store with bars on the windows in the worst part of town. look at the label and that’s all you need to know. smells like napalm, tastes like diesel fuel and cat urine. they should have paid us to remove it from the store. for 30 cents a gallon, we got what we wanted - drunk.

Laser Malt Liquor;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);(bottle - 40 oz) Clear gold color with not much foam.

Third Base Golden Hawk Wheat;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Wheat Ale;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Sampler wheel at the brewery. Holy shit I didn’t realize they’d be 7oz tasters. Now I have 56oz of beer in front of me arranged in a wheel that makes me feel like I’m captaining a pirate ship. Hunkering down because this is going to be a long night. Anyway ... Clear straw pour with white head. Deeply toasted cereal wheat with honey is the impression from the aroma. Also feet. Lightly sweet taste up front with a really harsh, unpleasant bitterness in the finish. So much bitterness it hurts. 7oz is going to be an eternity. Banana flavored wheaties coated in nettles then burned and rubbed with hops. Palate: feels like bitterness coating my entire mouth. Overall: not great.
Third Base Golden Hawk Wheat;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Wheat Ale;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Another unfinished flavor, I.E. low alcohol with a lot of sweetness but no real flavor. Finish was fine but didn't have a lot of aroma. I'm not a wheat beer guy so I'm not the best judge of them.
Third Base Golden Hawk Wheat;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Wheat Ale;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Pours cloudy yellow with white head. The aroma is very grainy with some bread crust and toast, maybe some earth. The flavor is lemon, earth, bread crust, and seltzer. Dryish finish, a little astringent. Meh.
Third Base Golden Hawk Wheat;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Wheat Ale;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;This was by far the worst beer in their line up. There was a slight hint of wet hay in the aroma and the flavor was more akin to a pale lager than anything else. I could barely drink this.

Third Base Golden Hawk Wheat;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Wheat Ale;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. The body was a very hazy yellow with a white head.

Cedar Flying Aces Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cedar Brewing Company;hazy amber with a thin white head. Hoppy nose. Caramel malt and hops flavor, a bit of citrus but the hops overpower it. kind of thin and one dimensional as I didn’t pick up much else from this one. Decent.
Cedar Flying Aces Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cedar Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. This is not retired. Simply the brewpub changed its name. Same brewer, same beer, same recipe. This was the only beer served here with any hop character. However, the malt backbone has whimpered away leaving this an unbalanced watery potion of harsh hop bitterness.
Cedar Flying Aces Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cedar Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Clear light orange color with filmy off white head that left some lace. Aroma is of subdued malty caramel and sprucy hops. tasted of caramel and a touch of brown sugar with a pleasant soft bitter finish.

Cedar Flying Aces Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cedar Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub: Reddish amber with a lightly sticky head. Pretty watery. Sharp citric bite, but no body behind it.

Actually a very nice bitter that approaches an English style pale ale.
Cedar Flying Aces Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cedar Brewing Company;Dark amber body. Caramel and sprucy hops in the aroma.

Third Base Red Rocket Amber Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;"Sample #3 at brewpub. Medium amber with spotty lacing. Aroma of caramel, bread, honey, resin. Taste: moderately sweet with bitter finish (I’d say ""quite"" bitter, but after the last two this is a relief). Palate: medium body, aggressively high carbonation scrubbing my tongue raw. Overall: 3 down. I can do this. Also, yeah sports! And guns n roses. Yeah, I’m pumped!"
Third Base Red Rocket Amber Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a light to hazy red color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. The lacing was somewhat spotty and didn’t arrange itself in any sort of fashion - it just was all over the place in its lacing. The smell had mainly a malty kind of sweet to roasty/earthy bittered but tangy citrus hops. The taste was mainly sweet through the earthy maltiness. A more pronounced caramel maltiness comes out in the taste. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was right on par, as it wasn’t too sharp nor smooth - it seemed just right. Overall, good red ale worthy of having again.
Third Base Red Rocket Amber Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Not bad at all! Kind of a Marzen IPA hybrid flavor. I really like it. Nice sweet start with a light body with the tang of an Oktoberfest but an IPA finish.

If that is true, they must be brewing a million gallon batch. I get no oatmeal smoothness or thickness of palate. It is dark brow/black like a stout, but the head is thin and whispy. Far too watery for the style, this merely musters up a burnt flavor to the taste.
Cedar White Rapids Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cedar Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub: Very light yellow with no head to speak of. Lemon-grassy and shallow sweet candy, almost lemonade-like.
Cedar White Rapids Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cedar Brewing Company;Very light yellow with almost no head. The aroma is white bread with some oranges. The taste is slightly sour oranges with some grassy notes. I guess this is created for the Bud drinkers in the establishment.
Cedar White Rapids Ale;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cedar Brewing Company;Piss-yellow body with not much head. There’s a hint of grainyness or grassyiness in the aroma, but there’s not a whole lot there in the first place. Unremarkable flavor, light malts with pilsener-y hops thrown in.
Third Base Helles Honey Bock;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Had on tap at the brewpub with my fiancee but unfortunately was eating dinner and didn’t take good notes.
Third Base Helles Honey Bock;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Sample at the brewpub. This beer is a mostly clear amber color with a medium light beige head that recedes steadily. Sweet malt and honey aroma. Light body with an unrelenting sweet character. Honey and malt dominate the flavor, with just a touch of fruit in the background. The finish is sugary sweet with a malt aftertaste. Barely average overall.
Third Base Helles Honey Bock;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;amber with a thin white head. Not much in the nose, slight malt sweetness. Candy sugar, honey, a bit of hops in the flavor. Sweet at first, bitter as it goes down. Kind of water.
Third Base Helles Honey Bock;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. This is not retired. Simply the brewpub changed its name to Third Base Bar & Brewery. Same brewer, same beer, same recipe. The beer is served super cold here and has little if any aroma as it is. Hoes not smell like a bock, or even a lager. Light amber in color with a thin white head. I get little sweetness or honey. The beers here vary only in shades of amber and are all watery.
Third Base Helles Honey Bock;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Clear orange-ish color with thin off white head. Aroma was a bit lacking with only minimal brown sugar and honey. Flavor was equally uninspiring with a bit of light honey and a malty brown sugar note. Slightly sweet. Okay beer, but overall it was pretty boring.
Third Base Helles Honey Bock;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub: Golden amber and yet another sharp lemon twinge. Only difference between this and their White Rapids was a slightly darker color.
Third Base Helles Honey Bock;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Clear light gold with a thin head. The aroma is definitely honey with some breakfast cereal. The taste is light honey and some malted oats. There is also a hint of cherries and flowers. A decent light summer type brew.
Third Base Helles Honey Bock;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Golden color. Mild roasty, caramelly malt with a lightness that could be attributed to the honey. Meh.
Cedar Dunkel Weisse;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Cedar Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Muddy brown color with thick tan head that laced the glass. Nutty banana aroma with a healty amount of roasted malt. Flavor was similar. Full bodied, yeasty. Decent beer.
Cedar Dunkel Weisse;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Cedar Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub: Reddish black. Vaguely wheaty, yet still with the now famous Cedar lemon twinge. Decent enough malty sweetness, and probably their best offering while I was there.
Cedar Dunkel Weisse;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Cedar Brewing Company;Dark amber color with traces of head. The aroma is light malt with nuts and bananas. The taste is rich walnuts and some bread. Notes of beef jerky. Decent, but finishes a little sour.
Cedar Dunkel Weisse;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Cedar Brewing Company;Dark brown body. Dry, sort of smokey aroma. There’s also some caramel sweetness. Enjoyable flavor, has dark wheat bread and caramel. Finishes with sharp wheatiness. A good example of the style!
Spaten Münchner Hell / München / Premium;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu (AB InBev);Tap. Clayton Hotel, Manchester Airport. Clear gold. Barely a head.

Poured clear golden with a good size white head. Aroma of hops, malt, fruit and straw. Medium sweetness, moderate bitterness. Moderate body, oily texture, average carbonation. Not bad to go with the meal we had there.

Spaten Münchner Hell / München / Premium;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu (AB InBev);"500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5.2%. Pale golden. Medium, not-too-long lasting head. Aroma somewhere in between pear and sweetcorn. Moderate carbonation. Very straightforward lager. Equal parts grass, sweetcorn and bready malt, but all are so dialed down that it just becomes one flavour, completely dodging eaches potential naffness. Not dissimilar to Heineken (the hop extract connection, perhaps?). Cool and refreshing, with an entirely inoffensive taste (rarer among lagers than you might think...). Nothing to recommend for the beer-savourers; nothing to fault for the thirst-quenchers. Therefore I can't rate this too highly, but certainly not too lowly. Of course, for the price, most wouldn't think it was worth it, but hey ho. Worth drinking a bottle if you want to set yourself a baseline for lager - anything better than this is definitely good lager, anything worse probably isn't."
Spaten Münchner Hell / München / Premium;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu (AB InBev);Can. historical beer as long as I heard. sweet maltiness. can’t feel any dominating hops or aftertaste. Great one for thirst. A bit higher ABV than plain lager beers.
Ruddles Pub Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;From old tasting notes. Bright Amber orange color topped by a thick creamy mousse-like beige head. Mild toffee malt aroma. Soft creamy toasted malt flavor. Smooth and silky.
Ruddles Pub Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;14.9 oz nitro can-A copper body with a of course big foamy white head and an aroma of mild hops and malt. Taste of the same with a little sweetness thrown in. Not bad nor good.
Ruddles Pub Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Vinny and Jen are scary!! They make this beer taste normal... it needs something... like to crazies talking in the back ground!
Ruddles Pub Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;pub can. Yeasty aroma, some malts and a little hop spice. Pours out foamy white ad settles to a rich amber. Rich, thick, some malt sourness mixed with mild hop bitterness. Creamy feeling on the palate. Not a fan of some Greene King beers except for this and Ruddles County Wide mouth.
Ruddles Pub Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;From a can.Metal taste,plastic look,offensive aroma,Greene king,you get the picture.
Ruddles Pub Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Out of a widgeted can - This pours a light copper color with a creamy off-white head. The aroma is malty sweet and fruity. The mouthfeel is a widgeted smoothness, almost a bit too creamy... which is why I’m usually not too fond of things rattling around in my bottles and cans. It’s too much. This, tho’, didn’t taste all that bad. It’s basically a sweet malt drink with a mildly contrasting hops bitterness. Nothing too exciting one way or the other.
Ruddles Pub Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Tinned, nitro widget. Amber with gas induced head. Low impact poor quality tinned beer, metallic taste, thick mouthfeel with the nitrogen. Pants really.
Ruddles Pub Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;14.9 ounce can. Pours coppery with a huge nitrogen-widgeted cremy head, with a Guinness cascade. I just love these N2-widget cans. Aroma of hops, citrus, malt, and fruit. Tastes malty, fruity, hoppy, with a crisp, slightly dry finish. Very complex.
Ruddles Pub Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;This is another typical English nitro can along the lines of Boddington's or Caffrey's. Dark golden amber color with a medium creamy off-white head. Medium thin lacing too. The aroma is mild hops. Medium-bodied and creamy with a lightly malty and hoppy flavor. The bitterness comes through more in the finish which is very dry. Ho hum.
Ruddles Pub Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;typical nitro ale....too thin, underhopped, nice amber color, malty and a bit too sweet.
Hempen Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Consumed from the bottle but not inhaled. The hemp seeds add a unique flavor that might be unpleasant to some, and should not be likened to the flavors of hops as the brewer suggests. Might appeal to some, but I’ll abstain the next time this one passes around.
Hempen Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);The ONLY thing negative about this beer is that it is retired! The wonderful aroma hemp and hops hit you in the face the moment you opened it. No it doesn’t taste like bong water! It’s a good full body beer that’s hoppy and has a beautiful reddish color. The sudsy head even tastes good! I miss it and can hardly wait for it to come back. What a good idea Flying Dog!
Hempen Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);12oz bottle. Had this in 1997 with all of my hippy friends because it was made with hemp. Very weak and watery with a dirty finish. I remember comparing this to a combo of Bud and bong water. Thankfully it is not made any more so other hippies dont have to taste this evil ploy.
Hempen Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Notes on a ticket stub from The Other Ones 1998- Golden brown, fluffy head. Caramel and chocolate malts on the nose. Creamy mouth-feel with notable hints of nuts upfront. Finish’s with malty/hoppy blast
Hempen Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Yep, smells and tastes like hemp. Goes great with Bob Marley and cheez-it crackers. If your are expecting anything better then a pleasant mixture of corona and bong water, you will be dissapointed.
Hempen Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Had this beer on 7/14/1998. Color is a nice golden brown, carbonation looks good with a light head. Aroma is a strong malt scent with good back tones of hops. Taste is full of flavor almost a Pale Ale. It starts off with a creamy body full of a roasted malt feel, this goes down easy. The finish is also full of flavor with a light bitterness and a good floral hop flavor part of which they claim comes from the hemp seeds. It fits the description on the label very well and is a great full flavored brew.

Hempen Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Rating from memory, had a few years back. wanted it to be my 420th rating. Never found this beer to be hoppy at all. It had a sweet after taste almost like bottled iced tea. Aroma was sweet malty with some lingering hop aspects. Don’t know what hemp seeds taste like in order to say if i could taste it but like others have said it is a novelty beer.
Hempen Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Bargain bin at my distributer for $0.79 for a 12 oz bottle. I dont really know what hemp seeds are supposed to taste like but if they did substitue all the hops for hemp bitterness and flavor it kinda tastes just like a regular ale. This is not to say it is bad however, I actually enjoyed it. Deep amber color with a pretty good head. Some spice in the aroma, which is otherwise dominated by malt as is the flavor profile. You can clearly tell they used lots of crystal and caramel malts as well as a hint of chocolate. Just a brief hint of those cascades in the aroma as it warms. Different in its approach, yet very middle of the road as far as overall taste and uniqueness.
Fat Weasel Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottle sample at a tasting at troubles’s place. Thanks Stas. Clear golden. Oxidized aroma with malt, honey, caramel, cardboard, alcohol. Sweet flavor, oxidized, with malt, cardboard, honey, caramel, and a bitter stale hops finish with a bit of alcohol. Medium-bodied.
Fat Weasel Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Purchased at Trader Joe in Vegas. Pours a very slight hazy golden-amber colour with a warm cap, decent retention and lacing. Fruity, sweet, nutty aromas. The taste is pretty sweet, with some hops in the middle blending things, but with some metallic notes. Some oranges and light alcohol. Ugly label and the beer is not that well balanced. Glad I only have one of these.
Fat Weasel Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);12 ounce bottle. Pours a clear orange color with a small white head. A light toast and orange nose. Toasted malts, sweet sugary notes, berries, strawberry especially. Odd one. Like an E European lager. Not really my thing. But it still has a drinkability and sugary sweetness like a cake that is enjoyable.
Fat Weasel Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Had a bottle on the 4th of July. Aroma is brown sugar. Flavor is generic amber ale. Meh.
Fat Weasel Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottle. Pours a copper color with a fair head that fades quickly. Aroma isonthemild side with some citrus, caramel and bit of grain. Taste is also a bit mild with caramel sweetness, citrus and grain. Mild bitterness that lingers in to the finish. Fairly light body, quite smooth but expected a bit of character.
Fat Weasel Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);[Bottle (12oz)] Pours a slightly hazy gold with an average size frothy lasting white head.

Not sure what style this is supposed to be, whatever it is it’s only O.K.
Fat Weasel Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);From the 12 fl. oz bottle. Light amber yellow pour with huge, foamy white head. Clarity is decent. The aroma is a fairly straight forward corny, cereal malt character. A little toastiness. The body is light to medium but also creamy. The taste has a gritty pale malt character that ends clean and crisp. There is nothing exciting about this. It is another Trader Joe’s offering that manages to do the trick but does not stand out as anything extraordinary. But, sure, now I could eat a few hot dogs with it.
Fat Weasel Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);From a 12 ounce bottle. Pours a copper gold, slightly translucent with little carbonation. Smells like meister brau. Bitter and biscuity, can taste the alcohol. Leaves an aftertaste as if from a corroded pipe. Grows on you though. Not the best, nor worst.
Fat Weasel Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bready, slightly-off over-ripe tropical fruit aroma. Color is slightly murky yellow with a one-finger white head. Taste is really not bad. Slight tropical fruitiness, malt sweetness, mild hops bitterness. Very generic, but certainly not bad to the point of a 17, its current score. Perhaps I got lucky? From my local Trader Joe’s. I don’t want to have it again, but it’s definitely not bad.
Fat Weasel Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottle pours gold cloudy with white head. Aroma is slight fruit with malt. Very little other flavors. Taste is light DMS, caramel. Very astringently bitter. Like chewing asprin.
Beach Chalet West End Wheat;San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Beach Chalet Brewery;Pours a cloudy opaque golden with an off-white head. Sweetish fruity nose - but not very banana like. Medium body, sweet fruit with only a discreet edge of yeast. Dry finish, OK as such, just not very Hefe-like.
Beach Chalet West End Wheat;San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Beach Chalet Brewery;Not terrible for a wheat beer, but certainly not great. As far as this brew pub is concerned, come here for the view and food.... not the beer.
Beach Chalet West End Wheat;San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Beach Chalet Brewery;Draft. A light golden beer with a thin white head. The aroma has notes of citrusy and wheat. The flavor is sweet with notes of wheat, leading to a dry wheaty finish. Boring.
Beach Chalet West End Wheat;San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Beach Chalet Brewery;Sampled at the brewpub on 7/10/2009. This wheat beer pours a slightly hazy light gold color from the tap. Small to no head. The aroma is wheat and cereal. A light to medium bodied wheat beer.

Simple aroma- lightly wheaty and very clean with no ester actions. Light bodied and crisp. Clean wheat malt base meshes with a grainy pale malt sweet note. Not much yeast character.

Fischer Hoopla!;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fischer (Heineken France);Nice dark cola color, white head and good lacing. Slightly sticky malt flavor that lasted for a while. Smooth, I like it coming in a larger re-cappable bottle.

Fischer Hoopla!;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fischer (Heineken France);Not impressed with this one. Pours thin, taste is a hodgepodge of malts and hops with no definite direction in mind. Finish is sour and unmemorable.
Fischer Hoopla!;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fischer (Heineken France);"Sour nose. Barely tart at first sip, sweet and light malts quickly fade to grassy, gritty hops. Lingering sourness aftertaste. Strange. The ""quick taste"" is here and gone in an instant with only hints of sourness left over."
Fischer Hoopla!;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fischer (Heineken France);Sour, sour nose, but a mild taste. Pale amber color, with some grass and straw flavors. No real head to speak of. Needed a bit more complexity.
Fischer Hoopla!;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fischer (Heineken France);I found this to be a nice, fairly complex bitter. Nice, mild start with a touch of sweetness, finishing with a bitter taste and a bitter, but not overly so, aftertaste. A nice occasional beer, but not a regular one.
Fischer Hoopla!;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fischer (Heineken France);This beer reaffirms the fact that I don't like French beers. This just doesn't taste good and there's nothing special about it to make me interested in it.
Fischer Hoopla!;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fischer (Heineken France);The notes on this are as below... particularly bland and mediocre...........
Fischer Hoopla!;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fischer (Heineken France);As with most of Fischer’s beers they fail to meet my standards for acceptability and this one falls right into line. The beer pours a limpid gold with a bright white head that is average in size and frothy in texture, the lace a very thin but covering sheet. Nose is crisp and fresh, mostly malt, sweet and the start sweet with a fair malt presence, top is fair to middling in feel. Finish has a brisk acidity, the hops adequate and the aftertaste dry, just average, just to light for me, but not a total loss.

Beach Chalet V.F.W. Light;San Francisco, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beach Chalet Brewery;On tap at Lake Chalet under the Lady of the Lake alias. It pours a pale yellow color with a white head. The aroma has huge notes of buttered popcorn and dough. Uncooked grains. The flavor is the same.

Beach Chalet Fleishhacker Stout;San Francisco, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Beach Chalet Brewery;Sampled at Beach Chalet Brewpub in SF.

Beach Chalet Fleishhacker Stout;San Francisco, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Beach Chalet Brewery;Other than the fact that I was drinking this out of a cheap plastic cup, it was a good beer.

Blue Moon Abbey Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Dubbel;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Serviert aus einer Flasche 0.33 in einem Glas mit einer Scheibe Orange. Es ist lecker, sanft im ersten Moment würzig herb im Abgang. Aber mehr als eine Flasche will man dann auch nicht trinken.

Flavors of watery brown sugar and sour malt extract. A hint of what a good beer starts with but in general a miss.
Blue Moon Abbey Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Dubbel;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This is another light, refreshing beer, like Landshark, that I drink while it’s too hot in Texas. There isn’t much to the taste, but the slight orange under-notes are a nice change and provides an excellent accent for spicy foods, seafood, and even a good stout. One of my favorite things to do with Blue Moon is fill a pub glass about three-fourths full of Blue Moon and top the rest off with Guinness Draught.
Blue Moon Abbey Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Dubbel;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Nice little beer. Earthy nose with notes of toffe on the palate. Thin mouthfeel. Overall good beer nothing special.

Blue Moon Abbey Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Dubbel;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);It’s pretty good for washing down seafood. I don’t get the thing of serving it with an orange slice, though. This stuff tastes like a light lager with tang mixed into it. It’s already too damn orangey. Adding an orange slice to this stuff is like canned laughter in a sitcom... it’s the producer telling you you’re too stupid to figure out what’s going on.
Blue Moon Abbey Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Dubbel;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Ruby pour with a small fleeding tan head, malty sweet taste with an after taste of figs and toffee. I find the body a little light.. 5.6 avb ????

Belmont Top Sail;Long Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Belmont Brewing Company;Pale amber pour with a bit of head and some lacing. Solid malt flavors with a touch of hops to balance. Nice richness with earthy undertones. Pretty will made beer that is a solid performer, but nothing really stands out. I’d certainly put this on an order when I go there. this beer is a bit tought to recall in light of the fact that I tried their Hop Head Red afterwards, which blew it away.

Belmont Strawberry Blonde;Long Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Belmont Brewing Company;On tap at the Bonaventure brewery as their strawberry blonde. Pours a clear gold with a thin white head. Big fruity strawberries, smells artificial though, a bit like strawberry bubblegum from my childhood. Medium bodied, grainy and sweet, tastes a good amount like how it smells, fruity and gum like. If someone told me this was a radler, I’d believe it. Too sweet for bulk drinking, but the sample in my flight was doable, and I’m not ashamed to say I’d drink a full one by the pool on a hot day. I might not brag about it, but I’d definitely do it. Too sweet and gummy, but certainly drinkable.

Bison Pale Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bison Brewing Company;Perfectly trusty pale ale with more malt than hops (the old-school way). I like hoppier pales personally though.

Bison Pale Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bison Brewing Company;"Pours a nice dark honey color. Head quickly disappears into a halo of tiny bubbles around the edge of the glass. Nose is biscuity with very little hop presence. Flavor is disappointingly middle of the road as is the body. Reading the label led me to think I was in for a colossal ""C"" hop bombing. Unfortunately I got an average APA. Nothing special."
Bison Pale Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bison Brewing Company;This one poured a very fiery orange color with very light carbonation and a thin but creamy froth white head that laced moderately on the glass. Heavenly aromas of malt, grain, fruit and citrus, with the grain aspect dominating. The taste begins with an excessive malt front followed up by a nice Cascade hop bittering which dries the palate and allows the sweet malt to really work its effect in the aftertaste. Those Cascade hops are just everywhere these days. Nice palate feel, low carbonation, and nice dry ending sweetness. A nice pickup, thanks to beerguy101 for sending it my way.
Bison Pale Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bison Brewing Company;one of the few pale''s i can stand. nice malty flavor. helps that it is straight out of the tap.

Bison Pale Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bison Brewing Company;Semi hazy amber. Creamy off white head. Steady carbonation. Piney hop aroma with caramel and light toasted malts. Crisp. Citric yet sweet, bitter yet with burnt caramel notes. Solid lacing. Turns mellower as it sits. Nice overall flavor, kinda ESB-ish if not for the Pac NW hops. A decent pale ale. Not eccentric like their other brews.
Bison Organic Chocolate Stout;Berkeley, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Bison Brewing Company;Pour is a dark brown with a small tan head.

Bison Coriander Rye;Berkeley, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Bison Brewing Company;Interesting beer! Dark Copper color, small head. A spicy light bodied ale. The question is the spiciness from the coriander or the rye? Probably a little of both. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is hoppy and spicy. A different taste. I like this beer a lot.
Bison Coriander Rye;Berkeley, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Bison Brewing Company;Horrible. This was absurdly overcarbonated. The liquid (most was fizz) tastes like lemons/lemon peel--I don't think this is a good way for beer to taste. The coriander provides artificial bitterness and causes coughing. Different and good aren't synonymous. I'd drink Budweiser over this.
Bison Coriander Rye;Berkeley, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Bison Brewing Company;Very aromatic with hops and lemons dominating. A nice tart/crisp mouthfeel with a balance of lemony coriander and tons of grassy hops. Lovely brew. Thanks us_ex.

Bison Organic Gingerbread Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Bison Brewing Company;This grew on me a little towards the last sample of the 4-pack. A little thin for a porter. Flavors kind of like a sour. Has potential to be an 8 in that category, but the balance not quite there. A little too much spice for my preference though, as it overtakes the chocolate malty qualities that represents this style.

Bison Organic Gingerbread Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Bison Brewing Company;This is one of my favorite holiday flavors :) It has a very rich toasty flavor while the gingerbread in it is very distinct while not overdone. It’ll pour dark but isn’t as bitter as some of their other brews :)
Bison Organic Gingerbread Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Bison Brewing Company;Drank a bottle shared with the family. Smells like mild stout, dark too.

Beli Saazer Doppelkaramel;Lohnbrauhausen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Unknown Origin - Germany (Brauerei Nemo Namenlos);Sweet, sweet and more sweet. Heavy malt components in the nose and flavor. OK for a malt beer, particularly compared to Pinkus Malz (see my rating). Needs something to balance the sweetness.

Oggis Black Magic Stout;San Clemente, California, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;"March 31st, 2015 - Last on the list here at Oggi's is the Black Magic Stout. Predictably dark, the nose has some heavy charcoal and a little teriyaki but the smell is mild and mild mannered. The flavor is rich with soy and teriyaki, and a little jerky spice, but the body is just a touch thin. I lean back and feel that the beer is ""okay"" which is better than some of the brews from today's tasters, and worse than others."

Slammed this because we had to leave and I found the need to stuff in an extra pint. Also cuz it was average and required no thought but ’consume’. Roast, choco, bit o’ coffee, slight ashy thing, sweetness close to licorice but not close enough. Off to find any shitty store that sells liquor and without doubt will carry a small selection of eye opening craft at prices that will make me weep.

Oggis Sunset Amber Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;March 31st, 2015 - The Sunset Amber invests all in on honey as an attractive aroma and scent. Colored like honey too, it smells deeply of mesquite honey and...honey, and more honey, drizzled with honey. The flavor is also dominated by the honeyed taste, though it is tempered by a slight nuttiness and a good carbonation. The mouthfeel remains a little flat, but it matters little when the flavor is so strong.
Oggis Sunset Amber Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;My third and final 16oz pour at Oggi’s Encinitas outlet on 8th May 2016. Asked for it not to come in a frosted glass, still arrived so cold it had no aroma foe ten minutes and no taste for even longer. Amber blend with not a lot going on to be honest, knock up the temp by 15 degrees and it might have been decent. Scored kindly and objectively.

Oggis Sunset Amber Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub Of all the beers that were brewed to some style this may have come the closest to being true to itself. A lightweight memorable bitter would fit in well with the tons of average casks at small pubs dotting the English countryside. Aroma / Appearance - A rich caramel base is the color of melted chocolate bars. Calm malt and earthy hops float in the air like a light mist. Iced tea and semisweet chocolate provide some depth but overall this is a simple draft. Flavor / Palate - Almonds, walnuts, and iced tea refresh the palate. The transition is mildly bitter and soon fades in the back of the throat. A decent amber / ESB is fairly mundane and something to pass the time over lunch.
Oggis Sunset Amber Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;On tap @ Eastlake location: I took very little notes about this beer and that’s a sign to me that it wasn’t that important. Appearance was a dense mahogany color that looked as though it did have some artificial coloring and was able to create a nice frothy head. The flavor and aroma both seemed to have more hops present then malts, but the flavor was nicely balanced and seemed to stand out to me as a decent amber ale.
Oggis Paradise Pale Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;March 31st, 2015 - Oggi's Paradise Pale is not a complex brew, but not bad either. There's a slight happiness with a bit of grapefruit at most. The carbonation is strong and supportive, with a good depth of hops. As the taste proceeds in gets a little sweeter, bringing in bubble gum and grapefruit. And that's about it. Minimal but tasty, it works well with the smell of pizza in the world.
Oggis Paradise Pale Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;Draught at Oggi’s in Vista, California. Hay golden/orange beer with a decent offwhite head. Hoppy bready aroma, caramel, citrus notes. About the same in the flavor, rather blend and boring.

Oggis Paradise Pale Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;"A completely milquetoast pale ale. The adjustment of hops feels muzzled and the nose is near-absent. The appearance is hazy gold with light piping on the head. Best as a filler for a sampler; skip the pint."
Oggis Paradise Pale Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;Tap. Clear pale amber, medium white head, great lacing.

Oggis Paradise Pale Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub Meh. This is a fair to middling pale ale that hints at much more. This felt like par for the course for Oggi’s. As a brewery they would be a fine place if not for so many other world class options just around the corner. Even so I have had plenty of worse beers. Aroma / Appearance - A caramel foundation supports a thin veil and icy legs. Cream, vanilla, and low key malts contrast with fresh earthy hops. The overall profile is middling to below average. Flavor / Palate - Creamy vanilla yogurt tickles the senses. After a few seconds it morphs into a mixture of malts and clean noble hops. The bitter finish of fresh brewed iced tea lasts for only a fleeting moment. In other parts of the country this would be normal. For southern California it sinks to the bottom of a crowded field.
Oggis Paradise Pale Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;18 jan 2014, tap at Oggis in Fullerton. Light gold, clear, no bubbles. Nose is pine and lemon hops. Odd body for an American pale ale. Reminds me of British cask ale, just slightly fizzier. Medium-ish body and faintly fizzy. Lemon rind and cereal malt with some bitter finish. Mediocre. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Oggis McGarveys Scottish Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Scottish Ale;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;March 31st, 2015 - Scottish Ale in name, the McGarvey's tastes a great deal more like a low ABV amber. Expecting heavy scents and dripping malty flavors, the aroma is more like a sweet toast, alongside some coffee beans. Where it really suffers is in the flavor, which is muted, though shows off some caramel and a little smokiness. But the flavor is a little flat, with only the mouthfeel any flatter.
Oggis McGarveys Scottish Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Scottish Ale;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;Not a bad Scottish Ale from a chain restaurant. Nice color and maltiness. Prety easy drinking.
Oggis McGarveys Scottish Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Scottish Ale;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;I thought this was a pretty nice Scottish ale. Not as sweet as many, gives it a nice smooth finish. tasty.
Eel River Ravensbrau IPA;Fortuna, California, United States;IPA;Eel River Brewing Company;Pours an amber color with a nice head from the bottle. It smells sweet with a bit of spices and herbs in the nose. It is a thick IPA and a bit bitter. I found it to be very balanced.

Eel River Ravensbrau IPA;Fortuna, California, United States;IPA;Eel River Brewing Company;"Nice amber color with a rocky and frothy head. Sweet, biscuity-yeasty nose.

Eel River Ravensbrau IPA;Fortuna, California, United States;IPA;Eel River Brewing Company;On tap GABF '02: Amber color, flowery/spruce aroma. Starts sweet and ends even sweeter.
Eel River Ravensbrau IPA;Fortuna, California, United States;IPA;Eel River Brewing Company;I love this beer, a wonderful dark (I know) and the hops! This is a great beer, all hopheads must go to Fortuna and give this a try.
Eel River Ravensbrau IPA;Fortuna, California, United States;IPA;Eel River Brewing Company;Dark for an IPA with some amber, excellent floral aroma with a hint of vine. There's some significant sweetness -- what if it aged longer? Still very expansive with bursting hop and a hin of dark roast finish.

Eel River California Blonde Ale;Fortuna, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Eel River Brewing Company;Sampled on draught at nFuse at the Marriott at the Anaheim Convention Centre. A pale blonde ale, with a light malt flavour and mildly bitter, light hop taste. Very easy drinking and refreshing. Surprisingly tasty, but just a little on the bland side.
Eel River California Blonde Ale;Fortuna, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Eel River Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy medium golden yellow color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, orange, peach, pear, melon, red apple, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light pepper, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of citrus/earthy hops, pale/wheat malt, and fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, orange, peach, pear, melon, red apple, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light pepper, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light herbal, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of lemon, orange, peach, pear, melon, red apple, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, pepper, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of citrus/earthy hops, pale/wheat malt, and fruity yeast flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Not as crisp/clean as expected, a bit too malt heavy. Zero warming alcohol for 5.8%. Overall this is a nice American blonde ale. All around nice robustness and balance of citrus/earthy hops, pale/wheat malt, and fruity yeast flavors; smooth and pretty refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. A bit too fruity/yeasty, but not overwhelming. A nicely enjoyable offering, and good style example otherwise."

Eel River California Blonde Ale;Fortuna, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Eel River Brewing Company;12 oz bottle into a La Chouffe stemmed tulip on 2nd Jan 2018 at my daughters in California. Slight haze to the golden orange body, full white uneven crown of foam on top which sadly soon turned into a wisp and collar. Not a lot going on aroma wise, some light grassy floral notes as the beer warmed maybe, otherwise nothing. Taste was fairly bland too, or subtle, depending on your kindness. Refreshing but boring.

Eel River California Blonde Ale;Fortuna, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Eel River Brewing Company;From can it’s clear orange-gold with a short and unsustained head. Smells of grain ethanol, gunpowder, cake frosting, fabric, chemicals, not much in here that resembles hop or malt. In the mouth it’s light bodied, sweet and filmy, tangy and hooch-like in the finish with a poor malt liquor-like representation of pale malt (tasting of corn, saccharine, alcohol). All sorts of technical problems with this one.

Eel River Certified Organic Extra Pale Ale;Fortuna, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Eel River Brewing Company;Poured into a pint glass. Bought this for a buck at local place. I was only going to have one beer tonight, but the last one sucked so bad that I needed to drink this as well. 2.0 A: Hazy brownish yellow color. Agressive pour resulted in half a finger of head that fell quickly, but surprisingly left a decent amount of lacing. 2.0 S: Slight (as in zero + the smallest discrete unit of measurement) floral hoppiness and nothing else. 2.5 T: Slight bitterness along with the meagerest of citrusy hops. Nothing else really going on other than musty vegetal-like flavor. 3.5 M: Not as horrible. Medium body, but it lays heavy on the tongue (like carbonated lead or something like that). 2.5 D: The worst part about tonight is that this wasn’t even the worst beer I’ve had.

Some orange and vanilla in the aroma, in an off or old sort of way. Solid straightforward crisp bitterness, oddly characterless, with a sweet sugary aftertaste. An interesting variation, I’m sure it fares better brewery fresh. As for the bottle, definitely sub par stuff. Soapy, gross sugar syrup aftertaste.

Nose of light malts and hops with hints of citrus and flowers. Mouthfeel is very clean and it has a refreshing taste, and flavors are very nice for a pale lager. According to the brewer this was their first brew. I do not know how old this one is, but it tasted fresh and clean, and was pretty darnn good for a pale lager. While this type of beer is dominated by some of the worst beers in the world, this one stands out from the pack for me and it the best example oI have tasted.

Eel River Ravensbrau Porter;Fortuna, California, United States;Porter;Eel River Brewing Company;"From a 22 oz bottle purchaed directly from the brewery at the brewpub. Poued into my Duvel glass it was a very dark brown that rose into a big tan head that left large chunks of lacing as it settled. I generally find dark beers show their best if not served too cold so this one came directly from my 55 degree ""beer cellar"". Solid nose of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, with a touch of sweetness that was both caramel and fruit. Very rich and smooth tongue-feel and nice and oily going down. Flavors were like the aromas only with a little hops and a bit of exta sweetness that adds to its character. This is an exceptional Porter It it too bad Eel River brews don’t get wider distribution. I notice that this is the first rating in 3-1/2 years. I believe they are going to expand their brewing capaciy soon so maybe this will become more available to beer lovers everywhare. It sure deserves it.. It is great."

Pours a clear very deep orange-red with an average size off-white head. Mild aroma of hops, some mild roastness and a hint of smoke (didn’t expect that). Flavour’s a little toasty, less sweet and fruity then most of the Bitters I’ve had here which is a refreshing change, more bitter as well. Some caramel malt and nuts in there too. Medium bodied. Pretty enjoyable stuff.

Tetleys Imperial (Pasteurised);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;On tap before a trip to White Hart Lane.

Tetleys Imperial (Pasteurised);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;"Slightly aged sample Medium but dense, creamy off-white head; orange-foxy beer with a slight haze all the same. Bit of caramel or even toffee, yet not overly sweet nose. Some extra smell that reminds me both of honeysweets and... stinging nettles? Caramel, and a discreet hoppy bitterness that has a metallic, even galvanic tang to it. Bit smoked, but not as smoked malt nor ashes. Reasonably refreshing, bit gassy. Something vaguely (hazel)nutty in the aftertaste. The ""Imperial"" name is less than clear. It’s a decent bottled ale, for sure. Thanks to podge, who yielded to my stubborness."
Tetleys Imperial (Pasteurised);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Bottle. This is actually a very nice bottle of beer. Tastes of confidence and experience. Nice brown sugar flavours, caramel and toffee with a gentle balance of hops. Very drinkable. [2.8]
Dinkelacker Dark;Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Dinkelacker-Schwaben Bräu Stuttgart;It was ok, but had a thinner body, mouthfeel and taste than Hof Brau Dark which I had had a night or two before. I would not order this particular Dinkelacker again.

Dinkelacker Dark;Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Dinkelacker-Schwaben Bräu Stuttgart;11.2 oz green bottle, I’m hoping for no skunkage. It pours a dark brown with a hint of reddich/orange/gold. The head is fizzy and off-white. The smell is classic, no skunk here. It has caramel, cocoa, and dark bread. Along with this is some honey and some light husky grain. I’m not really smelling any hops. The flavor is excellent, everything you want in a dunkel. It is smooth and caramally with some cocoa, raisin, and munich malts. The hops are present in the flavor and add a little zest to it. It is extremely drinkable. A winner.

Dinkelacker Dark;Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Dinkelacker-Schwaben Bräu Stuttgart;Like a slightly thicker Warsteiner Dunkel in every way, a little bit better malty flavor, just not anything better than a little better than average.
Dinkelacker Dark;Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Dinkelacker-Schwaben Bräu Stuttgart;12oz bottle. Translucent amber-brown color. Minimal soda-like head. I’d have to guess the bottle was old. Pungent, devolved dark malt tones. On the light side of medium bodied. Some toffee tones. Cheap Eastern-European dark beer. Probably way better fresh, certainly not one to age.
HopTown IPA;Pleasanton, California, United States;IPA;HopTown Brewing Company;O-town throwdown III 2007. Bomber shared by hopscotch. Pours a hazy peachy amber with a thin head. Aroma is loaded with DMS- tons of cream of wheat doughiness, yeasty dirtiness, grass, chalky and mineral with stale cheesy hops. Flavor is more doughy yeast, corny dms, wheat dough, pastry dough, grass, stale cheesy hops, light toast and a light bitterness- lots going wrong here. Sucks cuz it seems they have probably fixed these problems. My notes are from 3 years ago, but hey are pretty detailed. Ill try to find a bottle and re-rate.

HopTown IPA;Pleasanton, California, United States;IPA;HopTown Brewing Company;Bottle shared by puzzl. Pale amber beer with a nice clean crisp hoppy aroma. Orange and grapefruit over a fairly clean malt base. The aroma is more impressive than the flavour and the beer doesn’t taste nearly as hoppy as it smells. Light breadiness. Still, quite good, if indistinct.
HopTown IPA;Pleasanton, California, United States;IPA;HopTown Brewing Company;Bottle, shared by puzzl. Gold / amber pour, some haze. Aroma is nice, citrus hops, fresh, some caramel malt. Flavor is decently balanced, medium bitterness, same citrus and malt presence. Good but nothing to set it apart.

HopTown IPA;Pleasanton, California, United States;IPA;HopTown Brewing Company;Hazy orange color with nice sized off-white head. Nice nose of citurs and pine. Flavor is more hoppy than the nose leads on. Big hit up top, then the slight malty flavor rounds out this medium body brew.
HopTown IPA;Pleasanton, California, United States;IPA;HopTown Brewing Company;Cloudy orange, moderate head with good lacing and retention. Aroma is citrus, pine, some wood, some grass. Medium bodied, moderate to low bitterness. Somewhat light, doesn’t bring the big hop flavors I expect from the C hops.
HopTown IPA;Pleasanton, California, United States;IPA;HopTown Brewing Company;On tap. Nose is nice citrus hoppiness. Decent looking beer with a full head. Flavor is a good blend of the pineapple hops and a sweetness from the malt, that subsides to a clean bitter finish.
HopTown Golden Ale;Pleasanton, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;HopTown Brewing Company;Pours cloudy yellow with a massive white head that fizzled away quickly. There is a floral aroma and a substantial, slightly bitter caramel malt flavor. A pretty good light beer.
HopTown Golden Ale;Pleasanton, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;HopTown Brewing Company;I am going to bump this one up. As far as Golden Ales go, this one is one of my favorites.

HopTown Golden Ale;Pleasanton, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;HopTown Brewing Company;A great big thanks goes out to cquiroga for the bomber of golden ale. Beautiful pour in a big 22 oz clear mug. Looks like a hefe with an unfading tall rocky head. Very appealing look to the sparkling carbonation. On the tongue it’s also quite zesty. Uh oh, do I smell a little butter? Can’t taste any butter in it. Has more of a citrusy bite. Tho a bit hoppy, quite an interesting experience. Some bitterness builds on the top back of the throat during the finish. Appears to be quite fresh, S4L4F3T4O10 hoptown golden
HopTown Golden Ale;Pleasanton, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;HopTown Brewing Company;Very hazy straw gold, big white head with decent retention.

HopTown Golden Ale;Pleasanton, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;HopTown Brewing Company;In the bomber bottle from HyVee CB. Pours a cloudy, yeast chunky deep overnight pee gold. Has an incredibly thick as a brick white concrete head. This has a very solid yeasty and bready aroma. I really love this beer because it tastes just like many homebrewed golden ales that I have made. It is thick and has lots of lemon-yeast flavors at the finish. Plenty of hop presence without seeming bitter at all. Just a great homestyle beer.
HopTown Golden Ale;Pleasanton, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;HopTown Brewing Company;"Bomber from Bottle Barn; Nose of sweetpeas; very floral and sweet; lightly hazed gold with a huge white head; flavor of light hop bitterness, and some lemony citrus."
HopTown Golden Ale;Pleasanton, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;HopTown Brewing Company;"Hazy straw color, tons of sediment kicked up in the bottom of the bottle, a little of which made it into the glass. Very carbonated, producing a massive, yet short-lived head. Lightly perfumey grainy aroma, a little bit of lemon essence; moderate yeast presence. Fairly sweet opening, segueing to a somewhat flabby grainy body, more sweetness, more lemon and perfume. Pretty clean finish, light yet prickly hoppiness. A little low on the hops for my tastes - I like this beers pretty dry with some refresing bitterness. Very sharp carbonation, which I actually like here, but it’s still a bit too much. I keep thinking I shouldn’t like this style, but yet I do."
HopTown Golden Ale;Pleasanton, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;HopTown Brewing Company;22 oz bottle given to me by heermer77. Thanks Eric. The bottle said 5% AbV. Served at cellar temperature. There was some nice yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Poured a hazy golden color. Head was rocky and white with pretty good retention. Aroma was mostly of cereal grain and light citrusy hops. There was also a whiff of caramel. Dry and effervescent on the tongue with carbonation on the higher end of the spectrum. The flavor was dominated by bitter citrusy hops without much of a malt backbone (other than some light cereal grain). The bitterness peaked at about 6 out of 10. Overall, this one was light and easy to drink.
HopTown Golden Ale;Pleasanton, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;HopTown Brewing Company;Bottle from Johncy’s in North Liberty, IA. Cloudy gold body with a bright white head. I smelled soap, watermelon and some light grapefruit in this one. The taste has light hints of grapefruit rind with some roasted peanut shells. There are also some strange notes of pears and black pepper spice in the finish. This is a brew that seems to me to be halfway between an amber and a Belgian Golden strong ale.
HopTown Golden Ale;Pleasanton, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;HopTown Brewing Company;From a 22 oz bottle poured a hazy gold with a huge foamy head the just would not quit.

HopTown Old Yeltsin Imperial Stout;Pleasanton, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;HopTown Brewing Company;Sample at the Most Honorable SuperHappyFun Stout Tasting: After reading the label, I think if it were me vs. a long Russian Winter, this wouldn’t be a bad beer to have along for the fight. This beer smells like it might keep you warm on those long, cold nights. Aroma is booze and vanilla. A very syrupy quality that leaves a coating on the tongue here. Dark sugars. Did I mention booze? This tastes stronger than 9%.
HopTown Old Yeltsin Imperial Stout;Pleasanton, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;HopTown Brewing Company;This was a 22 oz bomber i had for a while and it was not bad at all with a lot of roasted malts and hints of coffee and chocolate as it warmed the abv was apparent and it had a nice rich taste to it.CHEERS!
HopTown Old Yeltsin Imperial Stout;Pleasanton, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;HopTown Brewing Company;Sample at the Most Honorable SuperHappyFun Stout Tasting. Bottle from Park Lane Liquor in Lancaster, CA. This beer pours black with a medium beige head that recedes steadily. Stringy lacing. Aroma of roasted malt and coffee, plus some hops. Rich body with a chewy mouthfeel and flavors of roasted malt, coffee and hops as well as some dark chocolate. The finish is rich and smooth with sweet malt and coffee lingering in the aftertaste. Pretty good overall.
HopTown Old Yeltsin Imperial Stout;Pleasanton, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;HopTown Brewing Company;Vintage 2005 Pours opaque black with mahogany edging, and barely a quarter-inch of beige head. The whisp of foam dissapated quickly leaving a placid surface and few small streaks of lacework. Aromatics are full of dark chocolate, Kahlua, and espresso-drizzeled fudge. A hint of tart vineousity follows though along with a trace of nougat. A bit short of full bodied, but still chewy enough. Velvety, slick and oily. Lowish carbonation. Rich, dark chocolate leads off the pallet, with coffee infused fudge and charred cocoa nubs. Black forest cake batter drizzeled with a Kahlua reduction. Bitterness is balancing, and hopping in general is without a trace. Alcohol is barely warming and an afterthought at best. Finishes quite mellow and rounded, with a hint of vineousity. Very much like a aged Baltic porter. Great stuff and very well could be peaking at three years. Still quite fresh tasting and bold, but plenty of aged complexites and mellowness.
HopTown Old Yeltsin Imperial Stout;Pleasanton, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;HopTown Brewing Company;Bomber. Poured clear, very deep brown with a shorter cap of dense toffee head. My first impression on the palate with burger grease.. thankfully that dissipated promptly.. became molasses with some dark chocolate and coffee character.. roast was moderate in the aroma, and much more pronounced in the flavor department.. deeper, and it really hid the alcohol well. As mentioned, the flavor was more roasty with molasses, licorice, and coffee represented.. sticky licorice and soy with some coffee bitterness at the finish.. just too roasty without enough flavor development to make it really good. Heavier-bodied and slick with low carbonation on the palate.. the heavy roast stuck at points, and this never developed as I would like.. overall a decent and drinkable, but far from great imperial stout.
HopTown Old Yeltsin Imperial Stout;Pleasanton, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;HopTown Brewing Company;Pours black with a brown sheathing. Great smell of pit tree fruits, vanilla and blackened malts reminds me of a buttered sweet roll. Velvety smooth mouthfeel and way too easy to drink. Good taste is well balanced with sweet ripe pit fruit up front then bitter blackened malts to finish. Good stuff. 012606

HopTown Old Yeltsin Imperial Stout;Pleasanton, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;HopTown Brewing Company;22oz, I think from HiTime. Thick black pour, looks oily, with very minimal head. The aroma is fairly rich and chocolatey, with some roast coffee coming through. First sips are quite pleasant, with a pleasing balance of roast and somewhat dark fruits, like overripe plums or even prunes. A pleasant mix, but somehow I feel this beer would be better with a richer, creamier mouthfeel. The taste just isn’t quite deep and intense enough to carry it as is. Still, a very solid RIS that I’d be stoked to drink again.
Lake Tahoe Crystal Bay Red Ale;Crystal Bay, Nevada, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lake Tahoe Brewing;"""this beer is way dark for an amber...but it’s not really a red either. i think they just did what they wanted with this one. it’s malty all the way, like a brown but sweeter. it’s actually an unbalanced mess (no hop presence whatsoever) but for whatever reason i’ve always really enjoyed it. the caramel malt flavors are great, and it is refreshing and highly drinkable, just not true to the style for an amber or red."""

Lake Tahoe Crystal Bay Red Ale;Crystal Bay, Nevada, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lake Tahoe Brewing;This amber ale pours a dark amber color from a 12oz bottle. Small sized white foamy head. The aroma is caramel and sweet. A medium bodied amber. The malts are caramel and sweet. The hops are earthy. This amber is more caramel malt, than fruity and sweet. It is not as sweet as most ambers. Good carbonation. It is an amber, but not that objectionable. It looks like the brew pub is closed, but this beer is still being produced. This bottle was purchased within a couple days of sampling and seems fairly fresh, so where is it being brewed? Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.

Lake Tahoe Crystal Bay Red Ale;Crystal Bay, Nevada, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lake Tahoe Brewing;12 ounce bottle courtesy of Grant. Peaty, floral, caramel, musty, malty aroma. Definitely different and quite aromatic. I also detect some chewing tobacco in the aroma as well. Transparent dark amber/light mahogany body with a light tan head that is rather small with nice lacing present. Mossy, peaty, strange swampy malty flavors to start. I also detect some band aids as well. Turns a bit more coffee-like in the mid-late area. There is a weird astringent sourness later on, which seems more like a flaw to me. I am not a fan of this beer.

Magnolia Jubilee Ale;San Francisco, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Magnolia Pub and Brewery;I was pleased to be able to get this when I was visiting (on June 16th, 2007). I had it on the cask version. But...I didn’t care for it. Another hop-driven beer with none of the virtues of the Proving Ground. Amber in color, somewhat subtle hops (struck me as Maris Otter, but I see now that it was actually Cascade)--at any rate, a restrained vegetal flavor that didn’t suit me (but I don’t care for this style so much anyway). (on cask at brewpub)

Lost Coast Downtown Brown;Eureka, California, United States;Brown Ale;Lost Coast Brewery & Cafe;Bottle poured in tulip Aroma: light to medium roast coffee, a little roasty, a little sour (like Ethiopian coffee) Appearance: amber body with thin head, head retention is low. (The bottle was from 08042018 so there was a significant of precipitate in this bottle. When I poured, I was trying not to get all the precipitate into my glass, so the head was thin, but I still saw silky precipitate in the body in my glass. Donno if this is normal) Flavor: coffee, with a sour hint, but not nearly as strong as the scent indicates. Some level of sweetness, like caramel or maple syrup. Low level of bitterness, well-rounded taste profile with some hint of roasted nut and butter-y note, in a pleasant way. Mouthfeel: not too bubbly, not too fizzy, moderate level of CO2 in the body. The body is very smooth, and this beer is easy to drink. Overall: I think this is a very good and very unique brown ale with its focus on the roasted coffee profile in the flavor.

Mount St. Helena Imperial Stout;Middletown, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Mount St. Helena Brewing Company;Bottle:   1999 vintage from brewandbbq.   Still black after 12 years.   Thin sudsy brownish head, dies as I pour it, with no lacing.   Yeah, that too is expected.   Still some roasted malts and graham cracker on the nose, despite the aroma of oxidation.   Very musty and basement like on the tongue, super dank, with a soft roasted malt background.   Seems a little gritty and dirty.   I guess whats to be expected after 12 years.   There is a slight hint of sourness to this one, but its minor.   Body has a lot left to be desired.   Again, I am surprised that a beer this old isnt worse than it I thought it would be.   Any bitterness has diminished, leaving only a small roastiness with a hint of sweetness.   Otherwise its dank and musty, like a basement full of old coffee bags.   I gotta say that I am actually somewhat impressed that this isnt completely sour.   Seems like most brewers today can’t brew an Imperial Stout that doesn’t sour after a few years.   I opened this thinking I would be pouring most if ot down the drain, but its quite the opposite.   I am totally over analyzing this one because its held up extremely well.   This is one of those gems in the bunch that you never expected.   Damn...

Mount St. Helena Imperial Stout;Middletown, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Mount St. Helena Brewing Company;"As the foam shot down the sides of teh bottle from underneath the cap which was not yet fully removed, I though, ""yep, this one is shot."" Quick reflexes managed to get the the bottle to the other side of my narrow kitchen and into the sink with only minor splash damage to the counter and dishwasher near the sink. Still highly carbonated, it took forever to pour what remained of the 12oz bottle into my .75 liter glass. As I waited for the head to subside between pours, I drank the Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout. I was actually afraid to go back to this, fearing that it would be badly infected. Instead, it comes out very nice. The aroma is nice, melon, a hint of fresh grapes, bananas over the mellow warmth of the malt. The flavor is milky, more of the banana esters, chocolate, caramel and just enough coffee and char to be noticed. The beer is quite attractive with it's large, lasting head and dark body, but I have to count off 1 point since you have to wait for it. I'm also counting off for the overcarbonation in the mouthfeel, although after it had been sitting in the glass for an hour it was just creamy instead of overcarbonated."
Mount St. Helena Imperial Stout;Middletown, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Mount St. Helena Brewing Company;Riveted pockets of pillowy tan head preside over a hazy dark, dark brown body. Aroma of prunes, espresso, grapes, and hazelnut. Flavor is quite smoky, interesting and not off-putting hint of metallicness, tar-like malts. A little bit of bubblegum and a pleasant bitterness help obscure the raucous alcohol taste. Not too bad.

Rubicon Irish Red Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Rubicon Brewing Company;March 15th, 2013 - Here’s the second beer of the day here at San Diego’s Epic Beer Festival - a malty, Irish red. It’s got the flavor, but not the mouthfeel, weighing a bit too lightly on the palate, and more closely imitating Killian’s Irish Red than a brew with a bit more body. Give this a little more muscle mass and and I’d really dig it, but as it stands it’s a touch too light for my personal preferences.
Rubicon Irish Red Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Rubicon Brewing Company;"vast amount of hops that are present in this beer (given the style). way hoppier than an irish red should be. definitely an ""american"" red ale, no matter what they call it. the hops and carmel and slightly nutty malts pair well together, and this is indeed a nice session ale. just don’t expect a traditional irish."""

Hoppy nose dominates malt scent, lot of grapefruit and pine. Taste is super hoppy (more grapefruit and pine, plus orange) for an IRA, which I personally find extremely yummy, but with a robust, earthy caramel malt presence that stands up to the hops very impressively. Very easy to drink. Maybe too hoppy for the a traditional IRA, but a very good offering by Rubicon.

Rubicon Irish Stout;Sacramento, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Rubicon Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. It pours dark brown with a tan head. I can see a little light through this one. The aroma is pretty standard with some coffee and cocoa, roasted malt, hint of black licorice. The flavor was the same, although a bit muted. Also, the body was very thin, even for a nitro stout. Roasted malt was very weak. Nothing really wrong with this brew, just a bit substandard if you ask me. I’d stick to their lighter colored beers which are very good.

There also is some roastiness present in the background. Smells good. Moderately transparent dark mahogany body with a fine, nitrogenated light tan head. A little too transparent for my liking. Starts somewhat metallic with scant, sweet choco malts. This then becomes very roasted, burnt, and even ashy with some patent malts. Some anise is also present. Finishes bitter and metallic.

San Francisco Alcatraz Stout;San Francisco, California, United States;Stout;San Francisco Brewing Company;Enjoyed a few pints of this one at the brewpub on a trip back to San Francisco, CA in July of 06.

San Francisco Andromeda Wheat;San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;San Francisco Brewing Company;"...draft, at the shithole. What a poor excuse for beer.

Tons of banana in both the aroma and the taste. This is a very fruity beer, and I think the sweetness would not be as pleasant over a whole pint. A very decent brew though.

He'Brew Genesis Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Labeled as a brown ale. Labeled here as an APA. I'd say a cross or somewhere in between. Appearance is semi-cloudy light brown. Balance is more on the hoppy side, but good caramel malt content. I am liking all of the Hebrews. Sampled a single first, but would get a 6 of this.
He'Brew Genesis Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Visual: (cellared for 4 years). Pours clear brown with no significant head, thin hazy ringed retention, some bubbles here and there, minor lacing. Nose: sweet nutty caramel malts (lvl-5)-pungency Attack: crisp-thicker mouthfeel Mid-palate: tingly CO2, toasted barley malts, bready-biscuity (lvl-5-sweetness) Finish: background gentle bitter hops, mild sour-tangy astringency. Summary: A good thick mouthfeel akin to their other beers, but this one having some astringency in the background and emerging in the finish. A bit above average.
He'Brew Genesis Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Dark orange hazy and no head. Flavor is bland but not infected or tart sour acidic just and real nothing brew. Good cold on fishing trip I guess.
He'Brew Genesis Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Rated from old notes. An easy going amber ale with a pleasant if non-distinctive taste. Poured with a foamy head that rapidly dissipated. Hints of malts, but for the most part rather bland. Best had with food.
He'Brew Genesis Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Pours a hazy dark golden orange color with apricot edges and a one finger white head that quickly settles into a thin, lasting ring. Spotty lacing left behind. Slightly earthy floral hop aroma with hints of pine needle and fresh cut grass countered by caramel malt sweetness, toffee, and biscuit. Kind if bland without much else going on. One dimensional hop profile and the malt presence is stronger than I prefer. Light bodied with delicate hop bitterness that lingers over the sweet malt backbone into a slightly dry finish. Light and easy to drink but not very complex or interesting. Dry, grassy bitterness countered by caramel malt, biscuit, toffee and a touch of dark fruit. Hop profile is one dimensional but has decent flavor. Malt presence is stronger than I prefer but provides some needed balance. Sessionable but kind of boring.
He'Brew Genesis Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Old rating. Bottle from Old Town. Slight hazy amber color with a big soapy head. Strong burnt caramel malt aromas with a touch of pepper and honey. Bitter on the palate and not very well-balanced. Leans toward the bitter side. Malts are there but seem burned and astringent. Finish is bitter and astringent.
He'Brew Genesis Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shmaltz Brewing Company;I don’t know about this one. It’s not very good and just a pain to describe. It’s basically a bad amber ale. The flavors are kind of weird and I can’t decide if this is a novelty beer or not. I don’t think it is. It’s kind of malty.
He'Brew Genesis Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shmaltz Brewing Company;"far more bitter than malty. a good, complex beer for the style, but it comes off just a bit harsh. like i said, more bittering hops, and maybe not enough citrusy high floral aroma hops. pretty good still."""
He'Brew Genesis Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Definitely more of an amber than a hoppy pale ale. Awful pour, tons of head with no lacing. Lots of malt flavours. Meh.
He'Brew Genesis Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a decent amber/red color with a slight transparency to it. The head was about a finger’s worth of white foaminess that dissipated within less than a minute. The smell had some crisp caramel malts coming through in a slightly dry sort of way. The taste was fairly sweet through the malts. On the palate, this one sat fairly light and had a fairly good sessionability about it. Overall, this was a decent Amber ale as its nothing to go bonkers about.
Southern California Screaming Lobster Lager;Torrance, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Southern California Brewing Co.;Clouded pale yellowy appearance, Heaily carbonated, moderate head formation. Malty, honey aroma, slightly skunked (albeit sold at the source). Sweet malty palate, not much bite. Unspectacular.
Southern California Buckhorn Bock Beer;Torrance, California, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Southern California Brewing Co.;Pretty good stuff. The higher alcohol content packs a punch that would cause you not to want to drink too many, but for a bock beer, this was decent. I'd have rated it higher, but bock beers just aren't really my thing..
Hofbrau Premium Light Beer;Torrance, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Southern California Brewing Co.;Straw yellow color with a grainy aroma. Flavor of grain and malt. Not much of a difference between this and the regular lager.

Birra Moretti;Milano, Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Heineken Italia;660ml bottle brewed in UK at 4.6%. Decent, fairly long-lasting head. Pale, washed-out lemon/straw colour. Medium carbonation. Grassy aroma. Brewed by Heineken, and isn't too dissimilar to Heineken, hop extract and all. A little lemony and grassy hop taste, then some somewhat-savoury malt, and that's your lot. A straightforward lager that manages not to offend the palate - nothing exciting for the beer lover, but could be so much worse. Not bad at all with a meal.

Razor Edge Australian Style Lager;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);From old tasting notes. Bright yellow gold color. Fluffy white head. Tart, malty nose. Dryish malt flavor hints at grain. Clear and crisp. Refreshing and drinkable.
Razor Edge Australian Style Lager;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);I found this in the back of my cellar behind some aging Lost Coast Eight Ball. Not sure how long it has been there or when I got it but if must be over three years old. Poured gold with almost no head. Nose of stale malts and floral hops. Fizzy mouthfeel. Flavor was bland. I suspect this was a crappy beer to begin with, and made no better or worse by age. I wonder if this was something Trader Joes once sold.
Razor Edge Australian Style Lager;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);(12 oz bottle: Wine Time in La Jolla, CA) Oh my God, look what I found in the 99 cent section of the beer cooler in this place. This store is always good for finding some obscure, retired, (supposedly) crappy beer, and that’s what I’m expecting with this beer too. Okay, well it pours a hazy, medium golden color, so that’s darker than I expected, but there’s also some nasty-looking brown sediment that’s not precipitating out of the beer. The head is small and whitish in color, but it is managing to hold onto a thin, partial layer atop the beer. It smells like a pretty awful lager that’s seen too many years in the bottle, which of course is entirely appropriate. But at least the flavor isn’t hideous. Well, actually, it’s pretty bad. It’s mostly just cheaply grainy, but also lightly sweet, strangely spicy, and a slight bit earthy. Body is light, but not crisp because of the age. Sorry for some disappointing news, but I think I bought the only bottle of this rare gem, so there’s no need for my local buddies to run over any grannies trying to get this beer.
Razor Edge Australian Style Lager;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy medium yellow, particles of all sizes, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (cookie), lightly hoppy (flowers). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter, slightly husky. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. A bit grainy in the finish, and the sourness isn't to my liking, but the aroma is pleasantly malty and floral. Reminds me of a cream ale...smells/looks like an ale, tastes/feels like a lager.
Razor Edge Australian Style Lager;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);"Sugary, ""cake-frosting"" nose. Cloudy, murky-gold with floaties - not inline stylistically. Very little head. Soft and sweet malt with chocolate-chip cookie dough flavors. Mild carbonation. Slight bite of hops in the middle. Semi-dry finish; chewy sweetness lingers - raw bread flavors. Overall, seemed ""green"" and unbalanced."
Razor Edge Australian Style Lager;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);Faint metallic aroma. Weak and thin but refreshing. No real flavor. Slightly bitter on the aftertaste. Overall, a boring beer.

Dorada Draft;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Bottle in Guatemala City. Paler and yellower than other Guatemalan lagers, I actually liked it less, even less flavour and more of a corny sweet skunky thing going on.
Dorada Draft;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;330 ml Dorado Draft Edícíon Especial - A limited edition fancy wrap around label on the bottle could no hide the otherwise carbonated watery taste. Very weak on taste, palate and aroma. Little to dislike but even less to describe.
Dorada Draft;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Bottle sample at a tasting at Beer & Beyond, Tel Aviv. Thanks DSG. Very light yellow with no head. The aroma is skunky, floral with notes of corn sugar and urine. Sweetish flavor, sugary, skunky, light bitterness, watery. Moderate carbonation, light-bodied.

Monte Carlo;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Bottle @ monthly tasting, Chez Sophie, Jan 19. Thanks Simon for this. Pours clear gold, small white head. Aroma is corn, sweet malt. Taste is sweet malt, cardboard, corn. Not too bad. There are worse.
Monte Carlo;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;"Green bottle share between four of us at the Jan 2019 Shrewsbury Beer Exchange group meeting; cheers to Simon's dad for sourcing this one. Poured a light golden colour, clean and clear, on top a decent enough white crown that tried to linger for a while. Fairly sweet in nature with not a lot of hop action going on, but a better beer that I was expecting."
Monte Carlo;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Tasted on 23.11.17. Small head disappearing to thin layer. Clear light golden colour. Weak malty aroma with hints of basement. Unpleasant malty sweetness with no bitterness.
Monte Carlo;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Bottle in La Havana, Cuba. Common Lager, with nothing special. Halped refresh on the Malecon
Monte Carlo;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;(12oz bottle) AROMA: a little floral and honey, sweet malt, hint of pils hops, smells a german-ish. APPEARANCE: pale straw yellow, light white head that fades quickly, clear, good carbonation. TASTE: sweet corn and a little tropical fruit, a touch of barley and coffee, hints of Bavarian Pils, some dryness on finish. PALATE: light and crisp, more body than your average mass market lager, some bitterness on finish in the cheek/throat. OVERALL: a very non-American style lager, more flavor and substance than what you’re probabaly used to from pale lagers, no bad flavors, I’m surprised at the low ratings.
Monte Carlo;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Bottle. Clear pale yellow with very small frothy white head, sweetish bread aroma, high carbonation, very little malt taste, weak watery body, abrupt finish. Slightly more tasty than water.

Monte Carlo;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Yet another example of brand proliferation from the mighty Cerveceria Centro Americana, this one appears to be a premium brand commanding roughly a 5 quetzal premium over Gallo. Not worth it. Tastes of nothing really, ever so slightly sweet.
Monte Carlo;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;355 ml bottle - Monte Carlo is quite hard to describe. Firstly I’ve had water with stronger tastes than this but despite its lack of taste, non-existent aroma and palate it is actually refreshing. Sampled twice now in 27-34c Guatemalan heat, it is really refreshing. Perhaps looking at it purely from a domestic market it makes sense, and on top of this it is actually sold as a more premium alternative to the mainstream Gallo. Having said that the Gutemalans I’ve asked prefer either Gallo Ice or Moza to Monte Carlo.
Ayinger Bräuweisse;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Aying;Bottle from Beers Of Europe. Hazy golden body with a white head. Lively carbonation. Faint lacing. Aroma of straw, white pepper and coriander. Flavour of grass, underripe pear and pithy lemon. Thin body with a slick texture. Very fizzy. Crisp and clean.
Ayinger Bräuweisse;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Aying;"500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5.1%. Dull murky orange, not too much yeast in suspension even with the lot poured in. Citrus, banana and wheat aroma, melded together. Smallish so-so lasting head. Moderate-medium carbonation. Citrus hops, bit of pear as well as banana in the yeast, and nice lingering nuanced wheat malt to round off. Fairly light body for a weissbier, but still has just enough of that foamy mouthfeel to deliver the goods. If you want plenty of flavour but not Erdinger-style super foamy mouthfeel, this is your bag. Ayinger as usual make a distinctive variant of a style while resolutely ticking all that style's boxes. Quality brew, if perhaps with not quite as much body as some fans of the style would prefer; it certainly doesn't fall short on flavour."
Ayinger Bräuweisse;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Aying;Der Geruch erinnert mich etwas an Most. Geschmacklich fruchtig, spritzig.

Ayinger Bräuweisse;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Aying;Cloudy golden, creamy ivory head. Gentle banana smell, light spicy, maybe some paper but clean otherwise. The taste is a pretty regular clean but not outstanding weizen with a touch of cardboard. Ok.

Ayinger Bräuweisse;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Aying;Bottle. Pale cloudy yellow/orange with a massive white head. Aroma of clove, banana, wheat, honey and yeast.

It's alright and really süffig but not my favorite Weizen.

Ayinger Bräuweisse;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Aying;I never tire of drinking a good Weizen. This time the honors were for Ayinger Bräuweisse. The first impression is that the beer isn't that yeast-cloudy. And the usual large foam head didn't make her appearance. The smell was a typical weizen though and the taste... It is a good one!

Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Aying;Served on keg, the Grove, Huddersfield, bronze coloured lager, with thin white head, (nice lacing on the glass), slightly toffee in aroma and taste. Does not taste it's strength.
Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Aying;Bottle pour into nonic pint glass from Total Wine & More, Burlington. Appearance is clear light orange/amber with beautiful sparkle, finger-width off-white foamy head with fair retention and no lacing. Aroma is wheat cracker, toffee and pear. Taste follows aroma. Mouthfeel is light side of light-to-medium bodied with mostly smooth but late frothy texture, soft-to-average carbonation and finish as taste with lingering sweet malts over mild bitter. Overall, about as interesting as this style can get and certainly well made.
Ayinger Urweisse;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei Aying;Dirty brown with a frothy head. Smell of banana and clove. Unbalanced taste with an acidity peak. Medium carbonation, banana aftertaste.
Ayinger Urweisse;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei Aying;"500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5.8%. Good-sized decent-duration head. Very dark murky orange, almost tan. Pretty focused aroma, citrus hops fused firmly with some wheat rusk with some yeast fruitiness underneath it all - slightly smoky, even. Moderate carbonation, fading fairly soon. Somewhat dark citrus orange hop notes, slightly muted but recognisable banana yeast joining them with a firm and tasty rusk wheat/barley brown bread-crust malt combination that underpins the beer and lends it a character distinct from a non-dunkel hefeweizen; there's a pretty tight flavour profile and while all flavours are good, none quite get to sing as I'd like - in particular the malt keeps its head down while it's working. Good creamy body, almost chewy, so it is perhaps the mirror of Ayinger's Brauweisse which is high on flavour but perhaps a tad thin for some drinker's tastes - not that either could be said to have poor flavour or body, mind. Don't let me make you think this beer lacks flavour - it doesn't - but it's just somewhat to-the-point for a style that can be so indulgent at its best. If you're not concerned with flavour developing lengthily on the palate, or demanding of a broad taste profile, this may be a perfect weissbier in your book, especially if you like its more compact, darker, slightly caramelesque malt than the typical lighter and airier offering. For me it's just a little tight, or to-the-point, even if only somewhat - I want it to stretch its legs and indulge damn it! Then again, that's only because it has such good flavours to begin with, so I can't exactly rate it poorly. You should definitely let this one stand a while and lose most of its chill for maximum flavour - perhaps even eschew chilling it at all if in cold climes..."
Ayinger Urweisse;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei Aying;Dark orange in colour. Smell and taste of banana. Quite good. Will recommend this. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Ayinger Urweisse;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei Aying;"Erinnert an die helle Variante ""Bräuweisse"". Der Geruch hat etwas von Most, allerdings mit dominanten Malznoten. Geschmacklich fruchtig, spritzig, süffig - deutlich malzbetonter, mehr Substanz und runder als die helle Variante. Eine bittere Note fällt auf - die ist sogar noch stärker als bei der hellen Variante ist (noch angenehm - mehr dürfte aber nicht sein). Erwähnenswert: Sehr stramme 5,8 % Alk. - hier wird die helle Version deutlich übertroffen. Gefällt mir sehr gut, sogar besser als die bereits sehr ordentliche helle Variante"

Stoddards Pale Ale;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Stoddards Brewhouse;Quite pale in color with medium head. This beer just didn’t do it for me. Subtle hops, subtle malt, sublte alcohol. Everything about this one was just a bit to subtle. It’s not bad, but there’s just nothing good about it.
Stoddards Pale Ale;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Stoddards Brewhouse;Colored a golden yellow with a lacy white head, the Pale Ale was quite attractive in the glass. Subtle bitter aroma. Hoppy and light flavor with a bit of a zing to it. Mild bitter leave. (submitted from the restaurant via my Treo)
Stoddards Pale Ale;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Stoddards Brewhouse;"Arrived in Sunnyvale on the 17th, and headed straight to Stoddards based on a recommendation from the kind peeps in the Ratebeer forum. This would have been my ""desert"" selection. This brew pours from the tap a light sparkling amber with a very thin white head. Something on the glass must have offended the lacing because it didn't show up for the party. The nose is faint citrus and spruce. The taste is mostly floral and toasty with a very british feel. Could use some dried fruit tones in the finish. The palate is medium to full, dry and lively. The finish feels chalky."
Stoddards Pale Ale;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Stoddards Brewhouse;Tap. Medium golden color. Crisp malt and hop aroma. Slightly bitter and grainy. Good malt aftertaste.
Stoddards ESB;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stoddards Brewhouse;Pours a deep brown color with thin head. Lots of sweet carmel malt in this one, not that bitter. Tastes a bit more like a brown ale to me. Not bad.
Stoddards ESB;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stoddards Brewhouse;Medium orange color. Small head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. A medium bodied ESB. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are slightly bitter and citrusy. Nicely balanced, medium bitter ESB. Touches of orange and citrus. Nice session beer. Mouthfeel is full and round.

Stoddards ESB;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stoddards Brewhouse;Draft. It's a beautiful reddish-brown color with a nice head. Lightly bitter and easy to drink. Sweet malt backbone with some fruitiness to it.
Stoddards ESB;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stoddards Brewhouse;Poured a nice dark amber with a creamy tan head that lasted quite some time. Subtle hoppy aroma with hints of sweetness to it. SMOOTH subtle flavor that just creeps up on you. Hoppy taste with overtones of wood and honey. Excellent beer.
Stoddards ESB;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stoddards Brewhouse;Arrived in Sunnyvale on the 17th, and headed straight to Stoddards based on a recommendation from the kind peeps in the Ratebeer forum. My first selection was this brew. Pours from the tap a medium copper. The fizzy white head is mostly diminishing with fair lacing. The meek nose is spicy and floral. The taste is balanced and fairly complex. The finish is long enough with a nice toasted bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium, dry and lively and feels very astringent at the finish. Not bad, but I knocked the overall down a point because it didn't meet my expectations for the style.
Stoddards ESB;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stoddards Brewhouse;Tap. A dark amber to almost brown. Malty and a little raisin or tea flavor. A hint of fruit in the aroma. Light body.
Stoddards Porter;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Porter;Stoddards Brewhouse;This was quite a decent beer. Lots and lots of roasted malt in this one. Coffee, burnt, and chocolate flavors are all over the smell and the taste. Nice full, smooth body. Easy to drink.
Stoddards Porter;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Porter;Stoddards Brewhouse;Dark and ruddy in the glass with a fluffy tan head. Faint malty aroma-nothing to write home about. I was expecting this to be yet another California watered down porter, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor of this one is VERY layered, with hints of roasted malt, sweetness, anise, and something else that I can't identify... almost an evergreen taste. Drink this beer.
Stoddards Porter;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Porter;Stoddards Brewhouse;Tap. Brown with plenty of clear spots at the edges. Great light brown head. Nice roasted malt aroma with hints of chocolate. Somewhat dry. Leaves a nice malty aftertaste.

Stoddards Kristall Weizen;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Stoddards Brewhouse;In the glass, it almost looked like a urine sample, unfortunately. Bright yellow with just a slight haze. The aroma was overpowereed by the lemon in the glass, but there seemed to be some serious sweetness to it. It tasted mild and wheaty, with a creeping bitter that lingers pleasantly afterwards. So apparently looks CAN be deceiving.
Stoddards Kristall Weizen;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Stoddards Brewhouse;Tap. Golden yellow with a well laced white creamy head. Solid body and simple aroma. I thought this looked and tasted more like an American Wheat. It had none of the haze or spice I expect in a German Wheat.
Sudwerk Northern Pilsner;Davis, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sudwerk Brewing Company;Not a whole lot to this beer bet a decent refreshing Pilsner. No bready Pilsner German taste.
Sudwerk Northern Pilsner;Davis, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sudwerk Brewing Company;Pours a a yellow color. Pretty good carbonation. Two finger white head. Good retention, great lacing. A little paler than typical pils. Aroma is light lemon and light butter. Lots of cracker malt. Zesty hops. Taste is malty. Lightly spicy hops. Good balance. Light lemon and pepper. Mouthfeel is medium light body. A touch of slick bitterness. Slides right down. Overall, this is a great pilsner. Not much more to say. I would recommend it and I would buy it again.
Sudwerk Northern Pilsner;Davis, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sudwerk Brewing Company;On tap at Venice Ale House on 15 October 2017. This is a clean and crisp beer that reminded me that Pilsners can have some flavour. While it looked a bit pale in the glass there was a lot more body and substance to this beer than I was expecting.
Sudwerk Northern Pilsner;Davis, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sudwerk Brewing Company;Bottle at Sunset Beer (17178 stamped...178th day of 2017? end of May?). Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy light to medium yellow. Aroma is moderately malty (grain, dog food, wort), lightly hoppy (herbs), with a light note of soap. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter, slightly unclean. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Could be a bit old at this point, but the malt seems really clunky/raw. A total dumper.

The smell has some sweet malt, hops and grain but it's light on the nose. The taste on first sip....very smooth was my initial impression. Light flavours of citrus hops and caramel malt with a bit of grain. Very buttery mouthfeel to it with medium carbo. A few more sips in and I notice a lot of bread and the hops are more noticeable. It finishes slightly bitter and has a short aftertaste. In my book, this is a good APA that maybe could benefit from kicking it up a notch or 2 in the flavour department. It went well with the pizza I had. ;^)"

CooperSmiths Punjabi Pale Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;From Sep 2007 On Cask This poured a clear, well, slightly hazy gold with a good 2 finger head of foam with lots of lacing. I love to watch the cascading head and, quite frankly, that gives it a good edge when it comes to my scoring on appearance. The smell has strong notes of grapefruit *and* caramel malt. One of the best balanced noses for brews of the style. First sip and the grapefruit just jumps out at me and is absolutely delicious but, in the background and swiftly moving in to share center stage, is that very tasty malt. Further sips and I find a complete harmony with the hops, which now also take on a floral presence, and malt and I reaffirm my belief that this is one of the best balanced IPAs out there. It finishes bittersweet, the carbo is very light, and the mouthfeel is silky smooth. Wonderful stuff! Bottom line: My favourite brew from Coopersmith's and it's going to take a hell of a brew to knock it off its thrown. Highly recommended!

Glenwood Canyon Red Mountain ESB;Glenwood Springs, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company;The name does not ring a bell, but the website says it is one of their 6 year round house brews. No doubt I had it, if not in a growler, than as a sampler, or sipped someone elses. Did not leave a lasting effect on me (on my memory (ok, that doesn’t help my point either)). Beer.
Glenwood Canyon Red Mountain ESB;Glenwood Springs, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company;The mountains of Colorado harbor many niches, nooks and crannies, within which lie a bounty of hidden mines, towns and even the occasional bakery (Silver Plume). Glenwood Springs is not what you’d call a quaint mountain town, exactly, but it’s not a global tourism destination either. Home to a therapeutic hot springs, it sees its fair share of visitors, and those who do go get a chance to visit the local brewpub: Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company. It is by no means an infamous brewery, or a landmark in craft beer, but it provides better beer to a town with one foot still in the past, and that makes it all the more charming. My family and I ordered a sampler to get a well rounded taste of the offerings, and I came away reasonably impressed, considering my expectations. The Red Mountain ESB took the third spot, in line with the chromatic scheme of light to dark, lucid to obscure. It is a very dark bronze color, rustic and burnt, a bit like Sicily, with a thread-thin head. The smell offered a great deal more, blasting the nose with a feast of caramel, sweetened-condensed milk, chocolate and the distinctive aroma of a temperate forest in the midst of a heavy rain. The taste is far less sweet, retaining the solid core of caramel, but replacing the sweet from the aroma with a metallic, cupric bitterness. In a broader perspective of the taste, it is still sugary and satisfying, overflowing with a shining caramel flavor profile, balanced with a less-than-ideal metallic contrast. It is refreshing, easy to drink, and relaxing – an excellent choice for a session beer, and a beer entirely matching with Glenwood Spring’s mountainous, pioneer feel. Slightly rugged, but comfortable and full of character: a beer befitting the town.

Glenwood Canyon Shoshone Stout;Glenwood Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company;I used to buy this stuff in growers. Big old gallon and a half (or maybe just half gallon, who knows?) and get it refilled for free whenever i took it back. Shoshone Stout was always my very favorite.
Glenwood Canyon Shoshone Stout;Glenwood Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company;The mountains of Colorado harbor many niches, nooks and crannies, within which lie a bounty of hidden mines, towns and even the occasional bakery (Silver Plume). Glenwood Springs is not what you’d call a quaint mountain town, exactly, but it’s not a global tourism destination either. Home to a therapeutic hot springs, it sees its fair share of visitors, and those who do go get a chance to visit the local brewpub: Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company. It is by no means an infamous brewery, or a landmark in craft beer, but it provides better beer to a town with one foot still in the past, and that makes it all the more charming. My family and I ordered a sampler to get a well rounded taste of the offerings, and I came away reasonably impressed, considering my expectations. The Shashone occupied the very last spot, ostensibly as the thickest, darkest offering from the brewpub. They’re right – but the Shoshone Stout is not a big, heavy, burly stout by any means. It’s sweeter than most, lighter than most, and a fine way to top a meal in place of a dessert or coffee. By appearance it is dark and opal, much like Guinness, but the aroma immediately indicates something special. The sweeter side of oatmeal rushes into the nostril, reinforced in its dulcet breakfasted theme with a hefty spoonful of brown sugar, peat, rich roasted coffee and the distinct scent of a greenhouse. The texture is smooth as silk, or better yet, smooth and soft as velvet, but not as dense or as decadent. It’s actually sort of weak and watery following a motif through Glenwood Canyon’s brew line-up. But, like the contemporaneous Nut Brown Ale and ESB, it makes for a calm, effortless drink, and a fine conclusion to a good meal at the brewpub. I think there are dozens of stouts like this one out there, but it’s nice to see it offered in the context of a restaurant and available to a community should they so desire something sweetly drinkable to shake off the chilly spring mornings in the mountains.

Smugglers Ingrams IPA;Telluride, Colorado, United States;IPA;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;on tap in montrose 7/19/10. golden color with a white cap. faint bitter aroma mixes with orange, grass, mild spice, malt and a little skunk. the flavor is the same... citrusy sweet in the middle with dirty earthy hops on the end. crisp. medium body with a little slickness. not bad. 6/3/6/3/13/3.1
Smugglers Ingrams IPA;Telluride, Colorado, United States;IPA;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;Draft. Mostly clear. Soft centennial nose, pine, some small amount of tropical fruit, light grassiness. Pale and weak flavor, needs depth and boldness. Body is unremarkable but there’s really no brewing flaws picked up, just a stale recipe that could benefit from more fresh/juicy/citrus hop character and more crispness.
Smugglers Ingrams IPA;Telluride, Colorado, United States;IPA;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;Salida Brewers redevous 2008. Appropriate to the style, nice color, reasonable hopping, pleasant finish but nothing outstanding.
Smugglers Ingrams IPA;Telluride, Colorado, United States;IPA;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;Draft at the brewpub during Telluride Blue and Brews Weekend 2006: Orange-red with a big grapefruity aroma. Chewy pine-cone hoppiness. Unfortunately there’s little body or base malt to back it up.
Smugglers Ingrams IPA;Telluride, Colorado, United States;IPA;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;"Slightly hazed; mostly orange color; nice head. Chewy malts, but with just a light sweetness. Quite a bit of flower juice. Big sourness, too. Moderate bitterness. Slight metal in the finish. Pretty good IPA, but kind of let me down, as I expected more."
Smugglers Strong Scottish Ale;Telluride, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;on tap 7/19/10 in montrose. clear auburn/dark brown with an off white head which drips a lot. it smells like a rich, sweet, smokey mix of caramel and chocolate creme candies. combined with citrus and grass it tastes the same... nice and malty with lingering smoke and sourness. medium bodied. crisp though rich. highly quaffable. 7/4/7/3/15/3.6

Smugglers Strong Scottish Ale;Telluride, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;Tap. Heavy malt aromas of toasted, strong coffee and molasses, light resin and earth for the hops and yeast, with cola, smoke, raisin and boiled root vegetables in the background. Head is small, bubbly, white with almost no lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is clear dark brown with a deep red tint. Flavor starts moderately sweet, and has a moderately sweet and lightly acidic and bitter finish. Palate is medium to full, creamy almost syrupy in texture, has a soft carbonation and finishes sticky yet slightly dry. A very good, well rounded Scottish Ale.
Smugglers Strong Scottish Ale;Telluride, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;Dark porter with an initially bitter taste, and a nutty aftertaste. Really great beer.
Smugglers Strong Scottish Ale;Telluride, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;Draft at the brewpub during Telluride Blue and Brews Weekend 2006: Dark, almost brown/red. Big and sugary malt with a hint of smokiness but a sweet swirly finish.
Smugglers Strong Scottish Ale;Telluride, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;Deep burgundy with a yellowish-tan head on my palette. Very smooth and creamy on my palate ... kind of chewy, even. Malts were nice, with roast, peat, chocolate and toast. Pinch of smoke, too. The aforementioned drifted into the aroma. Hops were in the background, nicely. Pretty good beer.

Smugglers Two Planker Porter;Telluride, Colorado, United States;Porter;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;on tap in montrose 7/19/10. typical porter color along with drippy off white lace. the aroma is pretty spot on... toasted nuts, coffee, cream, damp wood, roast and a little ash. the flavor is the same though a bit watered down. there’s a nice tartness on the finish. the mouth feel is off... maybe low carbonation and flavor? it is however tart, crisp and dry. 7/3/6/2/13/3.1
Smugglers Two Planker Porter;Telluride, Colorado, United States;Porter;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;Dark black porter with a light head that remains. Malty and pleasantly bitter taste with a slight chocolate aftertaste.
Smugglers Two Planker Porter;Telluride, Colorado, United States;Porter;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;Draft at the brewpub during Telluride Blue and Brews Weekend 2006: They actually had two porters on and I got the wrong one. This is black, but it’s really thin. It’s very, very bitter, like chewing on carred wood. Should’ve had the espresso porter ... never remembered to correct the error.
Smugglers Two Planker Porter;Telluride, Colorado, United States;Porter;Smuggler Union Restaurant and Brewery;Deep and dark brown. Very roasty and toasty. Sweet molasses base provided quite the anchor for this beer’s soul. Rich chocolate and some toffee gave it personality, with a little burntness to give it an edge. Very tasty, with decent aromas surfacing surprisingly often. Bitterness was mild, but surely there to try and balance things out. Pretty good porter.
Bank Street Safecracker Stout;Stamford, Connecticut, United States;Stout;Bank Street Brewing;Please note that on my older reviews I used a 100 point scale. To make up for any scoring discrepancies, all palate and apearance scored are assigned a neutralized 3/5. Undated 2001?: This looks just like guiness in the glass and has that cool bubble feature you see when a Guiness is poured. It tastes much more hearty than Guinness with a lot of sweet malty flavors and some bitterness.
Bank Street Safecracker Stout;Stamford, Connecticut, United States;Stout;Bank Street Brewing;Opaque with a creamy tan nitro induced head. Nice espresso and chocolate nose with strong hints of roasted barley. Oaty smooth body loaded with dry chocolate and roasted coffee. Lighter in body than I'd like, perhaps from the nitro, but solidly flavored none the less. Long aftertaste.

Willimantic Air Mail Strong Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Strong Ale - American;Willimantic Brewing Company;Growler. In the current world of beer-geekery, this beer is an imperial porter, no doubt about it. It just happened to be concocted without the existence of such a term, and since it’s a made up style anyway, there’s nothing concrete to warrant such characterization here. But it is what it is. In any case, chocolate, toffee, nougat, maybe some circus peanuts, and odd musty fruit sum up the beer. The first three, more traditional notes would be nice, but the weirdness creeps in too much for me here.
Willimantic Air Mail Strong Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Strong Ale - American;Willimantic Brewing Company;Growler from the brewpub. Pours a dark brown with a small light tan head. Aroma of roasted nuts, oak, roasted malt, and a sweetness that is hard to describe. Flavor is also a bit difficult to describe -- roasted notes, sweet malt, and some citrusy hops. Definitely an interesting beer -- part brown ale, part ASA, part porter, part IPA. But certainly drinkable, enjoyable, and worth a try. 7/4/7/4/15 [3.7/5]
Willimantic Air Mail Strong Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Strong Ale - American;Willimantic Brewing Company;Pours brown with a tan head. Smells of sage, spice pepper, caramel. Tastes of sweet malt, some nice spicy hints and a bitter finish.
Willimantic Air Mail Strong Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Strong Ale - American;Willimantic Brewing Company;3/10/08 notes: on tap, from Bram. This beer poured a deep red-brown, and thus was difficult to categorize by style. I thought it was kind of like a doppelbock, or a dark brown ale. Taste was full-bodied, creamy, smooth, nutty, with very slight hops and a nice malty-sweet undertone. Reminded me of offerings at Gordon Biersch (Winter Bock) and L’Amere (Bock). High Alchohol hidden very well, definitely a well-made beer.
Willimantic Air Mail Strong Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Strong Ale - American;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Tan head with a dark brown body. Very delicious. My bartender described this as a stout/porter hybrid, and I kinda agree with this comparison despite the fact that its a strong ale.
Willimantic Air Mail Strong Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Strong Ale - American;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Very dark brown with a thick beige head - a beautiful beer! Sweet, chocolatey nose tinged with earthy hops, some toffee. Thick, silky mouthfeel. Big toffee and caramel flavors, earthy. Not a sharp bitterness, restrained but firm. Excellent.
Willimantic Air Mail Strong Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Strong Ale - American;Willimantic Brewing Company;Served in a willibrew pint glass, pours a very dark brown with a thin tan head. Aroma is very sweet, chocolatey, sweet strong caramel, toffee, and figs. Mouthfeel is wonderfully full, thick, creamy and smooth, feels almost silky on the palate. Flavor is sweet all the way through, with some great complex malt flavors. Toffee, caramel, molasses soaked raisins, and strong surges of sweet chocolate. This is defintely worth a try, I’m sorry I passed up on it a week earlier when it was on cask. Damn.
Willimantic Air Mail Strong Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Strong Ale - American;Willimantic Brewing Company;Low smokey note to the malty sweet aroma. Almost opaque dark brown with a decent tan head that recedes to cover with some nice lacing. Round, full, thick and malty flavour with some spicy hops and fair fruity esters.

Small tap sample at the brewpub. Thick molasses with a lasting touch of creamy head...very slight malty nose, I just couldn’t get much out of it...sweet, malty thick body, molasses and nuts, vanilla and some stickiness...wish I could have smelled more.
Willimantic Air Mail Strong Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Strong Ale - American;Willimantic Brewing Company;Coca-cola color, nice off-white head is foamy and sticky. Another highly aromatic beer from Willimantic, smoky, beany and earthy, yet salty, caramelic and leathery. It’s nice to see that the brewer can handle the malt interplays as well (or almost) as it can move the hops around like a scalpel. Fully malty palate, earthy and anise reminiscent at first, yet the second part of the taste gears toward a far fruitier and sweeter finish, very grape like. Smooth medium to full bodied, rounding low carbonation. Another great mouthfeel for Willy.
Willimantic Mail Carrier Maybock;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Willimantic Brewing Company;Served in shaker golden, clear, no head. Medium bodied with mild hops flavor up front and a malty finish. Disappointing as Willibrew beers go, but not unpleasant.

Dogfish Head Shelter Pale Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dogfish Head Brewery;"From Aug 2007 I got this in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks, John! It pours from 12oz bottle a clear gold with a good head of foam that shrinks to a fine broken layer by the end of my session. The smell is rather delicate. I get a bit of floral hops but that's about it. The taste has some good malty graininess up front with a touch of bitterness that moves in about midway through and that's, pretty much, the highlight of this APA. I won't mention the ""D"" word but yeah, it gets overpowering for my taste buds and I'm having a rather tough time drinking this brew. In fact, I can't finish my glass. Dogfish Head makes some great brews so my not liking this one is neither here or there, if you catch my drift. ;^)"
Dogfish Head Shelter Pale Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dogfish Head Brewery;Bottle from Old Town. Pours a hazy gold with a finger of foam that lingers.

Dogfish Head Shelter Pale Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dogfish Head Brewery;on tap @ Vino Bellissimo / Lima OH --- Aroma of citrus and malt. Slightly hazy light-medium amber, white head that drops to a full cover, curtain of lace. Taste is malt with a heavy-handed bitter citrus in medium fizz, then all fades quickly in a short finish. Too much bitter. Poor balance, uneven performance.
Dogfish Head Shelter Pale Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dogfish Head Brewery;Bottle in 2011, clear or lightly hazy gold color with average sized head. Lacing wasn’t much. Notes of lager skunk, toast, toasted hop, and grain. Nothing going on with this beer.

Dogfish Head Shelter Pale Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dogfish Head Brewery;Bottled. Fondly remembered from back in the mid. 2000s when I thought 60 minute IPA was a really hoppy beer. Good times.
Dogfish Head Shelter Pale Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours a cloudy sparkling amber with an average size frothy tan head. Looks really good. Aroma of sweet malt and floral hops. Flavour of malt, hops and citrus isn’t hoppy enough -- in fact as it gets warmer it gets sweeter. Light bitter finish.

Dogfish Head Immort Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours cloudy mahogany with ultra-thin, light tan head. Aroma is maple, vanilla and molasses. Taste is light brown sugar and maple syrup (sweet, but not cloying), moving to wood and vanilla. Finish is smooth maltiness with a touch of an alcohol burn. A good barleywine.

Dogfish Head Immort Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogfish Head Brewery;"From Aug 2007 I got this one in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks, John! It pours from 12oz bottle a hazy deep amber with a very small head of foam with a bit of lacing. The smell is huge on the caramel malt...reminds me of taking a whiff of a JW Lees Harvest Ale or similar brews. The taste is as big on the caramel malt as the nose. Sweet? Yes it is. Too sweet? Not for my palate. There be big Oak flavours here as well and some vanilla.(says so on the label and it's true) There's also a good presence of dark fruit like fig and a touch of plum and it has just a wee bit of hop bitterness that shows up right before the finish. But as far as the style goes, I don't *want* much of a hop presence; the malt is king here and rightfully so. Great sipping brew and at 11%abv, that's the way to handle this baby though, I have to say, DFH has done a remarkable job of keeping the potent alcohol out of the taste and it doesn't really warm me at all as I swallow this nectar.The mouthfeel is thick and chewy and the carbo is light, just right for the style. I've had this one before, years ago, and I'm *still* enthralled with how well of a crafted brew this is. Ok, I'll go ahead and say it. It's one of my favourites. Thanks again, John!!"
Dogfish Head Immort Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogfish Head Brewery;"Not sure I'm on board with using juniper berries in a style as sweet as barleywine, especially one with the added touch of maple syrup. Starts with a nice, breakfast-like friendliness, the syrup and vanilla giving off a waffles-n-whipped cream vibe backed up by notes of apple and smoked tea. Bitterness on the back end shores up any cloy notes, but the juniper takes the brew in an odd herbal direction, like somebody stashed some pine needles in between your pancake stack. I'm a fan of hoppy-as-hell barleywines and juniper beers, but mixing the two ain't for me. Nose is caramel and toffee and juniper. Pour comes out a viscous, opaque brown with a modest off-white head and little lacing. Good texture; a year in the basement takes away any boozy heat. Too bad I can't reconcile the juniper and the sweetness."
Dogfish Head Immort Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours dark, orange/amber-whiskey color and nearly opaque with a 4 finger off white to tan head with an aroma of malt, vanilla and maple syrup. Tastes of malt, vanilla and maple syrup with an oak and Belgian yeast, clove finish with perhaps resin and bitter pine taste from the juniper berries. It has a sticky, viscous palate with little to no carbonation. It's full-bodied and exceptionally complex and a little smokey.
Dogfish Head Immort Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogfish Head Brewery;Deep brown with tan lacing head. Aroma is maple wood and berry. Taste is like a raisin liquor followed by some bitterness, ashy wood and alcohol burn. Like it.
Harrisons Black Diamond Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Dark brown color with an earthy, smokey/char aroma. Tan thin head that dissipated quickly. Flavor is burnt coffee, reminiscent of a fire that’s been out for awhile. Somewhat flat/low carbonation. Not at all one of my favorite stout samplings.
Harrisons Black Diamond Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;dark brown, coffee with cream head. aroma is coffee and sweet roasted malt. flavor of coffee and chocolate, not as sweet as i feared. medium bodied with a slightly bitter finish. the bartender said it ’is like guinness’, but i didn’t find it half as sweet.
Harrisons Black Diamond Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;On tap at Harrison’s. I think like most small brewpubs they want to appeal to the Guiness drinker. So here is their dry stout. Pours a dark brown with a frothy light brown head. Nose is surprisingly smoky and a touch of spice with all the roasted chocolate grains underneath. Mouthfeel is creamy. Chocolate roasted flavors are present but kinda weak and fading quick. Meh. Not good beers, but this huge place was full for a freezing thursday night. So I guess you don’t have to make good beers to survive sometimes.
Harrisons Black Diamond Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Had this one on draught at the brewpub in Orland Park, Illinois. Opaque, dark brown pour with a thick, medium brown head, soy sauce and smoky nose, bitter chocolate and more smoke throughout. Nice dry close. Outstanding example of the style!
Harrisons Black Diamond Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;On tap at Goose Island Stoutfest. Poured a deep mahogany with almost no appreciable head. Nose was oddly soapy with lighter fruits, some roasted chocolate, and it had a grainy aspect to it. Some dark, roasty malts were muddled in the flavor (fruits and coffee primarily)... with oddly-placed bitters. Astringency was rather high, and alcohol made its presence known. Palate was lighter-bodied with sharp fruity notes around the edges. Carbonation was low, resulting in a flat cola feel. I really got nothing good out of this one.
Harrisons Black Diamond Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Draft sampler. Let’s see. Sufficiently black color with a thin tan head that’s lingered after 20 minutes in the sampler tray. Good roasty smell. Taste? Surprsiingly smooth low-carbonation stout pull. A bit of Guinnessy sourness and a kind of creamy mouthfeel that works with the carbonation. Not very complex, but a beer that seems to be improving since last time I tried it.
Harrisons Black Diamond Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Opaque and midnight brown in color with a creamy tan head. Medium, erring on the thinner side of, viscosity. Oatmeal, dark chocolate, medium roasted coffee bitterness and roasted malts give it a trademark nose. Hershey’s chocolate syrup overrides other flavor elements, with other accentuations of semi-sweet chocolate chips meeting dark chocolate morsels. Resonating qualities akin to a chocolate laden iced mocha on the underbelly. Smooth, denser palate feel and much better than expected.
Harrisons Black Diamond Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;"More a ""sweet stout"" than a dry sout, Black Diamond has a strong chocolate presence and a sweet finish that I didn’t find as cloying as others have stated. Dark, dark, dark with a medium-brown, oily head. Satisfying."
Harrisons Black Diamond Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Probably the best beers that Harrison’s has to offer. Black pour with a light brow colored head. Some chocolate and roasted grain in the nose and the body. Fairly easy to drink. A solid stout but nothing to rave about. Pretty good atmosphere in the bar on a weeknight which helps.
Harrisons Black Diamond Stout;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Best of a sorry lot! But you gotta stand in line to get into this place, so they obviously don’t need my advice. Stand at the bar on a Friday night and you’ll see at least half of the patrons ordering bottled beers (Miller).

Caledonian Edinburgh Strong Ale (Cask);Edinburgh, Scotland;Strong Ale - English;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Tasted this in the Saltcot, Saltcoats (JDW) in November 2004. Cask, handpump dispense. Dark copper in colour with a thick creamy white head. Strong malty aroma of vinous fruits and caramel. Robust creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt complex gives rich moist maltloaf with dollops of raisins, figs, banana and maple syrup. Slight note of dusty hop resins but short lived as the aftertaste becomes dry and vinous. Finish has an alcoholic brandy like warmth with hints of christmas spices to it. A Scottish strong ale in the tradition of Broughton’s Old Jock. Well recommended.

Caledonian Edinburgh Strong Ale (Cask);Edinburgh, Scotland;Strong Ale - English;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);"[Cask at the Monks Retreat (JDW), Reading] Deep copper with a small off-white head and a slight fizz. Inviting malt and toffee aroma. Sweet toffee taste with a bit of cough mixture, some peardrops and a hint of vanilla and herbs. Comforting, lasting buttery finish - I know some people here moan about ""diacetyl"" (what’s wrong with ""butter...?""), but personally I think it works rather well in some of the stronger UK ales. Overall it’s a decent winter warmer."

S: sweet aroma of grain. in some unusual way it reminds me of breakfast. T: some honey tones from the sweet malts. decent bitters from the hops, but nothing that reaches out and grabs you, which is hit and miss with the Kolsch style. slight metallic tones in this as well, which is turning me off. M: leaves the mouth a little dry, and the palate a little bitter. has somewhat of a chalky aftertaste. D: its a good session beer if you are into Kolsch beers. I am not a huge fan of the style, but I do respect it. There are other Kolsch beers that I prefer, but it isn’t a bad beer either.

A rich caramel and slight fruitiness build right at the midpoint and recede into a grainy pale malt character. Tasty beer.
Dunedin Oktoberfest Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dunedin Brewery;Thanks to Degarth for this. Pours coppery with 1-finger off-white head. Aroma of caramel malt, brown sugar, vinous fruit, peaty earthiness, with a flvaor of peaty malt, caramel, some honey, brown sugar, and earthy notes. Finished slightly dry with some backdoor hops.

Dunedin Oktoberfest Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dunedin Brewery;Mildly hoppy with a slight caramely touch. Honestly, it’s pretty thin and bland. Oktoberfests just aren’t my thing.

Dunedin Christmas Farm Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Flavored - Other;Dunedin Brewery;Bottle from Degarth. Thanks Joe. Pours a copper-amber color with a bit of off white head. The blend of aromas come together to resemble a Christmas pot pouri or some dessert cooking in the kitchen. Not heavy notes at all but rather hard to define. Taste was the same. the flavors were subdued but still not bad.
Dunedin Christmas Farm Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Flavored - Other;Dunedin Brewery;16 oz bottle. Poured a clear copper color with thin white head. The aroma is on the light side with slight malt sweetness and hints of wintry spices. The spice flavors are bright with nutmeg, cinnamon and maybe even coriander. Behind the spicy veil is a murmur of sweet caramel malts. Lighter still is the note of hops. Too subtle for my hop stunted palate to discern. Nice tasty winter brew. The only negative I have for this low gravity ale is that the spices could be a bit softer. Sure wouldn’t want ‘em too soft though.
Dunedin Christmas Farm Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Flavored - Other;Dunedin Brewery;22 oz cl Bottle via Mystery swap from Degarth (thanks!). Pours a clear amber with a massive head that hangs around for almost forever. Nose is nice with some toasted grains, vanilla, honey, ginger. This doesn’t really come out in the taste though. Mostly just the toasted grains, way too much ginger, some malts, and some citrus hops. Chalky finish and tart aftertaste. So-so...
Dunedin Christmas Farm Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Flavored - Other;Dunedin Brewery;"the aroma is quite festive and strong! I can smell the cinnamon and ginger from at least a few inches from my nose. There is a strong pine presence as well. The flavor is filled with spices, but it is pleasantly earthy and not too sweet at all. As a ""winter warmer"" it is a bit too low in the alcohol, but nonetheless it is a pretty well-balanced and decent beer. Almost chewy mouthfeel, smooth."
Dunedin Christmas Farm Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Flavored - Other;Dunedin Brewery;Bottle from Santa - cloudy copper pour (hurray for unfiltered beer!), with a huge, frothy head - strong gingerbread aroma, with some doughy/yeasty hints - quite an earthy smell - quite sweet, but not overpoweringly so - the honey is quite evindent, and it mixes quite well with the ginger and nutmeg - bread/dough character from the yeast - it gets a nice zing from the orange zest near the end, before closing with a long finish of clover honey and herbal flavors - a nice change of pace from most Christmas beers.
Dunedin Christmas Farm Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Flavored - Other;Dunedin Brewery;Bottle at Cock & Bull, Sarasota, FL.

Heavy sweet spicy flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration.
Dunedin Highland Games Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Porter;Dunedin Brewery;A: The beer pours almost black with a finger or so of tan colored head. S: A mild smoke to the aroma. Some dark chocolate and roast, and maybe a little of dark fruits. The roast becomes more intense as it warms, maybe becomes a bit ashy. There are some definite problems here, especially a noticeable acidity. T: Slightly watery, but quite a lot has gone wrong here. Chalky and astringent with a strong roasted malt bitterness. Ash and roasted malt, a hint of coffee, a little bit of dark chocolate, too. M: Medium in both body and carbonation. O: Can’t say that I was too big a fan of this particular beer.
Dunedin Highland Games Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Porter;Dunedin Brewery;Bottled. A dark amber beer with a fast disappearing brown head. The aroma is sweet and acidic with notes of brettanomyces, smoke, fruit, and wood. The flavor is sweet with notes of smoke, brettanomyces, fruit, and wood, leading to a dry finish. Had it blind - my guess on a style was a thin smoked Flemmish sour - hmmm. Thanks Papsoe for sharing.
Dunedin Highland Games Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Porter;Dunedin Brewery;Draft and redlight. This would have been much better I think if I would have had a half of a glass. Just got to be too much towards the back half. Tobacco...really tobacco. Nice smoke to it...really liked the mouthfeel, but it should have been in a smaller glass.
Dunedin Highland Games Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Porter;Dunedin Brewery;Draft at Redlight Redlight. I almost feel bad reviewing this so poorly. It just wasn’t a flavor I like. I can understand people liking it, though. The aroma was smoked pipe tobacco. Flavor is lightly smoked with some mint and loaded with tobacco. It really reminded me of chewing tobacco. I had to pour it out.
Dunedin Highland Games Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Porter;Dunedin Brewery;Draft at Redlight Redlight. Dark brown pour with a thick creamy head. Sweet malt, tobacco and hints of peat aroma. Taste is smooth malt, smoky, tobacco and hints of fruit sweetness. Decent brew.
Dunedin Highland Games Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Porter;Dunedin Brewery;Draft @ redlight redlight. Pours a semi-transparent brown/black with a fuzzy brown ring of head on the edge of the glass. Some chocolate, tobacco, a touch of roast, malty caramel with a bit of peat smoke in the nose. Very tobacco-like in flavor, mildly roasty with hints of chocolate towards the finish. Towards the thin side of things, chocolate/roast notes are toned down for a porter, but still enjoyable.
Dunedin Highland Games Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Porter;Dunedin Brewery;Draft at Redlight Redlight. Pours a dark chestnut color with a slightly reddish hue. Mostly clear and translucent. A small, khaki colored head leaves a soapy wash behind. Aromas of sweet caramel malts and lightly pungent pipe tobacco are permeated by a distinct, meaty smokiness, while overly ripe, dark fruits and spices lend earthy depth. Flavors follow suit, mostly sweet and earthy, with a big dark caramel malt presence, and perhaps just a bit too tobacco forward for me. The smoke level is nice, and it really ties all of the varying elements together well. Medium bodied and balanced on the tongue, the mouthfeel doesn’t detract. Nice brew, but not something to go crazy for.

Dunedin Highland Games Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;Porter;Dunedin Brewery;Draft at Redlight Redlight. Pours black with a small light tan head. huge peat comes through in the nose, which really surprised me. Got some roasted malts, and coffee as well, but the peat overpowered them mostly. The flavor was much of the same. It says a hint of smokiness in the description, but its definitely a big hint of it. Made the beer more interesting for me, because I wasnt expecting that. Pretty tasty, maybe a bit underrated here.

Hops Clearwater Light;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Standard light watery pale lager aroma and smell. Very very generic, but to its credit, lacking the skunk factor of some mass protests diced swill.
Hops Clearwater Light;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Tap. Pours clear straw, small white head, some lacing. Aroma is light, grainy, lemon. Flavor is oddly sweet, lemon lime, grains, very light bitterness. Light body, soda like carbonation. Is this a shandy??
Hops Clearwater Light;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);So begins a lovely week of lagers. Waiting around outside Reagan for a flight that doesn?t leave to Honduras for a while. Golden, crisp. This is not terrible for a light Mcbeer. Tap at Alexandria brewpub.
Hops Clearwater Light;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Draft Flight 9/1/03 (FLL)-Pours a clear golden with a small head. Aroma of corn and sweetness. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew was not too good.
Hops Clearwater Light;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);"About 4 oz. served into a tasting glass. From notes. A: Pours a pale straw color with only a small white film. No real lacing, as expected. S: Almost nonexistent. There’s a touch of corn sweetness, and MAYBE some crackery malts...that’s it. Inoffensive, at the very least. T: The flavor - though minute - actually isn’t bad. A bit of mild graininess to start, only to finish with faint lemony hops. As a light lager, it’s actually a success - it lacks the sickly sweetness most of its BMC brethren have, due to its hop presence. Still, it IS a light lager, which means it’s boring. M: Very crisp, light, and easy to drink. This is pretty much how a light lager should drink. O: For a light lager, this is actually pretty great. Key words being ""for a light lager"". It’s still really bland and lacking in flavor compared to even an average pilsner. If you absolutely must have this style, this would probably be the one to seek out."
Hops Clearwater Light;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);This beer screams generic. Drink this instead of your water. No head, no aroma, no flavor worth mentioning.
Hops Clearwater Light;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Man, this is one of the palest beers I have ever seen. Mind numbing. Metallic and grainy. Kind of ’assy’ if that makes sense. Very light body with no hop character.

Hops Lightning Bold Gold;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);"Liked the light better than this garbage. While that was barely beer flavored water, it wasn’t as inherently unpleasant as this. This was ""bolder"" in that it had more of a flavor kick, but it was bitter and unpleasant."
Hops Lightning Bold Gold;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Tap. Pours clear yellow, small white head, some lacing.

Hops Lightning Bold Gold;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);About 4 oz. served into a tasting glass. From notes. A: Pours a golden straw color with a small white film. Looks pretty unremarkable. S: There’s a touch of caramel sweetness, and the mildest kiss of hops. T: This is pretty much a bigger Clearwater Light to me - which means the flavor is still low, but there are some noticeable lemony hops to balance the crackery malt. Actually, it goes too far into the other direction and ends up being soapy on the finish. M: It’s light with good drinkability, but a little low on carbonation. O: Honestly? Clearwater Light was better than this. This may have a bit more flavor, but it’s also too soapy. Not one I’d bother with again.
Hops Lightning Bold Gold;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Draft. Another pointless offering. A small white edge head gives this one an extra point for appearance, otherwise it’s wasted space in the glass.
Hops Lightning Bold Gold;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Meh. Almost average, but just lacking in all respects except clarity and clean character.

Hops Hammerhead Red/Thoroughbred Red;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Very generically malty and sweet, watery caramel - but not really hateful in any way. Just something you’d expect from a kit.

Hops Hammerhead Red/Thoroughbred Red;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);About 4 oz. served into a tasting glass. From notes. A: Pours a cola color with a thin khaki film. This is a red ale? S: I note some toasted caramel and a touch of citrusy hops. It suffers from the same problem the others beers in the flight did, the aroma was dreadfully weak. What was here was acceptable, though. T: Actually, this one seemed pretty roasty in its flavor. The roasted, toasted, burnt-to-a-crisp malts are followed up by touches of fruit esters and a very mild hop finish. Not bad. M: It’s thin, easy to drink, and with a dry finish. It feels a bit insubstantial, though (it’s not a light lager, so it can’t get away with it) O: A drinkable brew without flaws. Though it’s pretty bland regardless. I at least liked it enough to where I’d get it again on a future trip.

Ybor Gold Brown Ale;Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Brown Ale;Florida Beer Company;"12oz bottle Courtesy of Degarth. Pours a clear chestnut brown with a small ring of head; looks a bit like flat Pepsi. Gives off a mostly pleasant aroma of toasted grains and brown sugar punctuated by alcohol and a slight tartness. Smells stronger than its indicated 4.4%ABV. Flavor is nutty dry grain at first, then the ample malt comes forth to smooth out the dryness a bit. The slight tartness that showed up in that aroma also makes an appearance on the palate. Body is medium-full with a pretty thick palate. I don’t know if the tartness was by design as some English browns feature a slight tartness or if it’s from the fact that this sample is well over 3 years old and wasn’t always stored in optimal conditions. But in either case it held up pretty well considering I figured it might be undrinkable by now."
Ybor Gold Brown Ale;Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Brown Ale;Florida Beer Company;Extra in trade, from i forget? BM me. Dark amber, decent off-white head. Aroma is full of toffee. Smeels like the house, when boiling a starter. Flavor lacks a little compared to aroma, but decent. Toffee and faint buttery (not infected) nuts. Creamy smooth mouthfeel. Decent brown for sure, easy drink, make a nice fall session. Actually going to finish the bottle, which is more than I can say for most browns.

A medium bodied brown ale. Malts are malty and sweet. Touch of toffee. Slightly spicy hops. Nicely balanced. A lighter tasting brown ale. A touch thin in the mouth and kind of mild in flavor. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Ybor Gold Brown Ale;Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Brown Ale;Florida Beer Company;Clear brown with an off-white head, little retention and lacing.

First taste is a little light, but some nice sweet flavors come through quickly and finishes with a bit of nutty flavors. Medium carbonation and body. Thanks to Degarth for the bottle.
Trail Stash Amber Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boston Beer Company;12oz bottle. Had this in college between 1997 and 2000, then I dont know what happened to it. Nice and smooth easy hop drinker. Was a weekend beer that had regularly. Where did it go and whjen did BBC brew it?
Trail Stash Amber Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boston Beer Company;I know I’ve had this because I am looking at the bottle. So I will rate the bottle. Nice artwork but the backpack leaning against the tree looks like it could be uncomfortable if over packed. Would probably opt for an interior frame. Twist off cap with a descent drawing of the afformentioned pack. Bottle smells as though it used to hold beer, i do smell malt. Label says best enjoyed by Nov of 2000. So I hope I enjoyed it.
Trail Stash Amber Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boston Beer Company;Had this beer on 5/12/1999. Color is a deep rich brown with low carbonation and head. Aroma is a sweet malt scent. Taste is refreshing, clean and dry. It starts with a medium body that goes down with a medium malt flavor. The finish is a somewhat dry hop flavor and a mild bitterness. The finish does get a bit stronger as you drink. It’s not a brew I would go out of my way for but it is somewhat refreshing.

Trail Stash Amber Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boston Beer Company;Sweet and toasty - almost buttery. Pretty much on the side of too sweet - very little hop flavor or aroma. Very average at best.
Trail Stash Amber Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boston Beer Company;I had no idea this was made by BBC - is it still made? WHen I was a newbie beer geek, this had become a standard for my weekly drinking sessions. Lightly hoppy and generally clean. Some full soft sweetness bordering on caramel and crisp somewhat herbal hop flavor. A bit light in color for an amber.
Trail Stash Amber Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boston Beer Company;Redbrown, roasty and rather bitter beer. Harsh. ...........................

Cannon Ironclad Stout;Columbus, Georgia, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Cannon Brewpub;Very nice roast on the nose. Unfortunately, that roast transitions into slightly astringent ash in the flavor. That being said, this isn’t a bad beer by any stretch.

Max Gold;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Max Lager's;"Some servers at the brewpub will aim you toward this as Max’s lightest offering - making one think maybe this ""Gold"" is a ""training"" beer. Don’t be fooled! If you love a HOPPY as hell PILSNER, the current version on tap now is one of the best I’ve ever had. YES...it rivals Victory Prima Pils- Huge aroma, delicious hop flavors - fantastic! Now is the time to try this beer again."

Max Gold;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Max Lager's;Draft at pub. Pale gold, decent head. Pleasant floral hop aroma. Some diacetyl in the flavor, over a crackery pils malt, bitter finish. Lacked the promise of the nose. As it warmed, the faintest note of infection became present as well. Too bad, as that is probably what was muting some of the flavor hops along with the diacetyl.
Max Gold;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Max Lager's;Pale yellow, white head. Aroma is sweet, corn, pear, apple fruitiness. Taste is corn, sweet, lightly fruity.
Max Gold;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Max Lager's;Appearance: Served up a clear, yellow body with a smallish, white head. Smell: Max Gold is sweetish and spicy on the nose, with hints from the light pale malts and spicy, floral hops utilized. Taste: Sweet, lightly grainy malts impart a small hint of honey. Particularly spicy Noble hops with a medium-light (though perhaps not quite the purported 40 IBU’s listed) bitterness. Drying finish with a light, lingering spiciness. Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Lightly carbonated. Drinkability: A self-described Bohemian Pilsner, it suffers from a case of undercarbonation. Instead of even reasonably crisp, it falls flat and flabby on the tongue.
Max Gold;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Max Lager's;Location: On tap at the downtown Atlanta location 4/16/09 Overall Impression: Found this one to be an accurate example of a style that is usually pretty boring. I didn’t enjoy this one much at all. It’s a drop better then most of the macros, and that’s about it.

Max Pale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Max Lager's;On tap at the brewpub, 4/24/08. Golden amber colour with a mostly lasting creamy off-white head. Initial “green” character is taken over quickly by a bready, fruity, citrus, and woody aroma. Bready malts with a citrus, fruity, and woody bitter finish. Medium bodied, soft, but very nearly flat mouthfeel. Enjoyable pale ale.
Max Pale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Max Lager's;on tap at the brewpub. This is very cloudy and on the darker side of IPA’s, kind of a murky dark copper. Good head here. I am surprised by the hop definition in the aroma. It’s very bright, sharp with grapefruit and pine with a dash of caramel. Palate is smooth with just enough blatant malt sweetness. Citrus is throughout with a dry, bitter finish and a tiny sour twang. I can’t believe what a drinkable beer I’ve stumbled across. Props.
Max Pale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Max Lager's;Location: On tap at the downtown Atlanta location 4/16/09 Flavor: Nice bitterness, decent flavor Palate: Medium-Light body Overall Impression: I thought this was a solid APA, I’m not sure if this is a new beer, but from reading the ratings of the Max Pale I have to believe this is a different beer, as it was definitely not an IPA.

Max Pale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Max Lager's;The best beer of the bunch, but the more I had, the less I liked it. I think a lot people may have only had the sampler and thus overrated it. IT truel y got worse as it went on, IMO. It had a nice enough head, which was the only thiing from keeping this a 2 in appearance as it looked almost like a hefe with hazy hues and light colors. Not what an IPA shoudl look like. The aroma wasn’t bad. A lot like an American IPA should, citrus, grapefruit, pine, floral. The flavor was good, but like I said seemed to lesen over the pint.
Max Pale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Max Lager's;On draught at Max Lager’s on P-tree. Nice light golden-amber appearance with virtually no crown and light lacing. Aroma is very prominent with citrus hops, moreso than the Imperial IPA they had on tap. Nice bitterness throughout and nice hoppy finish. Good subtle malt backbone provides a nice balance between the hops. Mildly carbonated and overall a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. It would be great with some white or common fish.
Max Pale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Max Lager's;tap at ewery. top ten in atlanta isn’t saying much if this is in it. straw color pour. hop and grapefruit. too much fruit. As I found with many of their beers the finish is too tart.
Max Pale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Max Lager's;Draft......Very strong citrus-hop aroma, mostly grapefruit. Disappointed in the appearance, light orange, with absolutely no head or lacing, but had a . good taste and finish. Drank this outside in 80 degree weather, a perfect fit for a warm May evening.
Max Pale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IPA;Max Lager's;Pours a clear pale golden with a frothy, nicely-lacing white head. Earthy, lightly bitter hoppy aroma has some pale malt presence. Grainy semi-sweet flavor has some mild floral bitterness before a dry bittersweet finish. Doesn’t have that big fresh hop presence and malty balance I like in IPAs.

Max Maibock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Max Lager's;Draft....Pours to a golden orange color with medium white head and good lacing. Not much aroma that I could detect. Good taste, starts out on the malt side, with the hops becoming more evident at mid-glass. Bland finish. Not a bad beer, but I enjoyed the Max Pale more.
Max Maibock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Max Lager's;Medium amber, edging on copper with a lovely bubbling soup of a head. The body is not quite perfectly clear, but the hazing is only slight. Great lacing. Slightly hoppy on the nose. There is a surprising burst of malt up front on the flavor, but it fades to a nicely balanced lager after a few sips. Nice and clean without being bland, but not as crisp as some.
Max Maibock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Max Lager's;Golden color, good head and medium body. Good balance between malts and hops. Clean aftertaste. Pretty good offering.
Max Maibock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Max Lager's;Golden brew without much of a head. Aroma is yeasty, sweetbread and slightly peaty. A sweet beer with a clear orange gel flavor. Clean finish, perhaps a little on the thin side. (Personal Note: FH Relay trip with Wayne & Leo)
Max ESB;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Max Lager's;Quite confusing the place searching in Atlanta. This beer was fine, not much os bitterness and quite drinkable in every weather.
Max ESB;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Max Lager's;22 ounce bottle - $7.69 at Barrel and Barley in Woodstock, Georgia. Appearance: Pours a ever-so-slightly hazed, bright orange-gold body with a few fingers of white suds. Effervescent. Smell: Agreeably citrusy, though scantly soapy with a varied range of spiciness, cut wood, and pepper. The malts underneath are understated, at best, with only present mild, subtle crustless bread notes. Taste: Pale, wheat malts with a slight breadiness, light graininess. Very little sweetness. The addition of the white peppercorns is boosted by the earthy coriander, robust hopping, white ash aging, the orange peels, AND the alcohol. So, the spiciness hits and wraps around the tongue like an old slap bracelet. Lemony hops, also some tangy mango hints, and a slight grassiness. Medium-high bitterness. Drying, citric, bitter, and still fairly spicy on the finish, with a lingering spiciness and bitterness. Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-plus carbonation, sudsy mouthfeel overall. Overall: Goes beyond complex and does become a bit jumbled.

Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.
Whalers Tutus Guava Wheat;Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii, United States;Wheat Ale;Whalers Brewpub;Fresh, fruity nose and an orange-pink color. Interesting - fruity and lambic-like, but the beer comes through. Thin body, but appropriate and refreshing. Hey, when you're in the guava capital of the world, why not a guava beer? Though this is just guava syrup mixed into their wheat offering, I liked this.
Whalers Tutus Guava Wheat;Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii, United States;Wheat Ale;Whalers Brewpub;Hoppy but weak aroma with a hint of guava. Wonderful orange colur with a little orange head. Flavor guava and hoppy - makes nice mixture. A little bit to bitte for my taste. Refreshing summer beer.
Whalers Heepa Heepa IPA;Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii, United States;IPA;Whalers Brewpub;Draught at the brewery. Drank this years ago on our honeymoon but I found out Whaler’s is now closed. This was a little below average IPA but I can imagine that quality hops are hard to maintain in Hawaii.

M.J. Barleyhoppers Bock at the Moon Maibock;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Tap @ Brewery: Caramel amber color, light head and lacing.

M.J. Barleyhoppers Bock at the Moon Maibock;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Brown pour with light tan head. Aroma of sweet malt, some roast, and a hint of chocolate. Flavors are sweet, malty, and roasted. I small a mount of hops. Flavor and body are fairly light. Nice and easy to drink.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Bock at the Moon Maibock;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Medium brown, amber colored pour with a minimal head. Aroma is malty, mild in intensity. Taste is also malty, with some balanced hoppiness. The flavor was not as strong as I had expected - this is a medium bodied beer with a moderate flavor.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Snake River Porter;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Porter;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Dark brown with mahogany edges. Foamy head and good lacing. Chocolate aroma leads to a mocha touch. Small amounts of bitterness. Flavor again is touched with chocolate and bitter hops. Creamy mouthfeel finishing dry.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Snake River Porter;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Porter;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Tap @ Brewpub in Lewiston, ID<BR>Black, tan head and lacing. Nose of light maple, very little roast or coffee. Lots of chocoalte, sour and acidic flavor, some kind of infection thing. Very little porter flavor left.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Snake River Porter;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Porter;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Very drinkable porter. Body is more mild than medium, hints of chocolate, nuts and roasting. Sort of a stock porter for the majority of beer drinkers. I liked the finish the best, it shows character with a modest sense of bitterness.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Snake River Porter;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Porter;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Reasonable-modest roastiness make this a pretty standard tasting porter. As the beer warmed the roundness of the beer increased a great deal, making it rather tasty: coffee and nuts. Nothing too special though: this was good, but one of the most nondescript porters I''ve ever had.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Snake River Porter;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Porter;M.J. Barleyhoppers;This porter came off a little thin and wasn''t backed up with a huge taste. Not much of a head or lacing on this beer. A smooth porter ready for the minor leagues.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Harvest Weizen;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Tap - Very light in color, almost like the micro-brewery had to make something that would appeal to the Bud and Coors light crowd. I guess this is part of having a full selection, but I will pass on this one in the future.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Harvest Weizen;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Gold with a foamy head. Wheat and some citrus in the nose. Slight wheat in the flavors followed by a slight nothing. Leaves me with a blah feeling.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Harvest Weizen;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Tap @ Brewpub in Lewiston, ID<BR>Same appearance as the Huckle. Nose of husky light malt, some hop notes. Bland musky malty flavor, finishes light, decent body, ho-hum. This is what they push onto the bud drinkers.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Harvest Weizen;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Medium in body & hops, less than satisfying in taste. If I was new to micros, I’d stick to iced tea. This brew is MJ’s black sheep and should be kept in the closet.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Harvest Weizen;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;M.J. Barleyhoppers;"Hahaa...this is kind of funny. If ever you are in Lewiston you will understand what I am about to unfold. There is a paper mill on the Snake River that creates an overwhelmingly terrible smell similar to burning ham and cow pastures. The makers of the plant didn''t give much thought to the fact that Lewiston is in a valley so the entire place is just basking in this ""odeur de shiznit."" Upon entering this bar I thought I had finally rid myself of these toxic fumes, until I tried to Harvest Weizen - the smell came back in the aroma and taste; the wheat used in the beer must be grown in that valley."
M.J. Barleyhoppers Harvest Weizen;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Not good. Came off skunky and offensive. I can see why the Bud swiging locals love this stuff.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Barleyhopper Brown;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Brown Ale;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Brown with amber edges. Caramel and cardboard in the nose. Not too special. The flavor is full of caramel and some hops. I wasn’t overly excited about this one.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Barleyhopper Brown;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Brown Ale;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Tap @ Brewpub in Lewiston, ID<BR>Brownish color, tan head, light lacing. Nose of light plum, chocolate and strong caramel malt. Near a schwarzbier ale. Toffee. The flavor is grassy and chewy. Balanced and a sticky dull mouthfeel.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Barleyhopper Brown;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Brown Ale;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Another brown ale with typical tones of maltiness and a bit of nuts. Rather smooth with medium body and average taste. Didn’t notice any of the chocolate malt, but kept tasting the walnut and pecan tones.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Barleyhopper Brown;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Brown Ale;M.J. Barleyhoppers;The flavor is traditional brown: malty nuts and toasted sugar. I think Portlandrunk and I had very similar reactions to this, as I also think there was nothing special with this - just a good brown ale.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Barleyhopper Brown;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Brown Ale;M.J. Barleyhoppers;A fair brown ale. Nothing that really jumps out at you, but drinkable none the less. An agreeable beer.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Steamboat Stout;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Stout - Dry;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Tap @ Brewpup. This has amazing visual character with a rich black color and a big creamy head. The flavor has heavy coffee overtones but is smooth with mild bitterness.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Steamboat Stout;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Stout - Dry;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Black with lighter edges. No head or lace. Chocolate and roast aromas with some bitter coffee notes.

M.J. Barleyhoppers Steamboat Stout;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Stout - Dry;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Dark brownish, near black pour with an amazingly creamy head. Aroma aplenty and it is full of coffe tones ( I couldn’t taste much else ). Medium in dryness, a very versatile stout overall.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Steamboat Stout;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Stout - Dry;M.J. Barleyhoppers;"Very dry and full of coffee goodness. The first time I had a pint of this was with an enormous seafood buffet the restaurant associated with MJ''s has; that seemed to taste a lot better: rounder and more flavorful, but it isn''t unheard of for a dinner like seafood to affect your beverage...for the better even."
M.J. Barleyhoppers Steamboat Stout;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Stout - Dry;M.J. Barleyhoppers;This beer pours with a huge grey head that must be slurped away. Tastes very creamy as it enters the mouth and finishs with hop presence. Coffee flavors dominate the palate. Not too dry although listed as a dry stout. A beefed up Murphy''s.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Huckle Weizen;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Well this one was not half bad for a fuity beer. It would be great on a super hot summer day, but in the middle of fall was a little out of place. The beer is crisp and has a nice palate. If you are not a big fan of beer flavor and want to enjoy a cold one, go for this one.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Huckle Weizen;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Golden with a filmy white head. Chock full of huckleberries in the nose. I do so love huckleberries. The flavor is not so intense in the usage of huckleberries. Some maltiness there as well. Berry finish.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Huckle Weizen;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Tap @ Brewpub in Lewiston, ID<BR>Pale gold, light head and lacing. Nose of huckleberry, light malt, simplistic. The flavor is more malty and husky with light chemicals and more fruit. Decent but they could have used a better base beer.
M.J. Barleyhoppers Huckle Weizen;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Huckleberry is present in mild amounts and certainly doesn’t dominate this beer. Normal amount of hoppiness for a German Hefeweizen meshed into a fruit beer. The best fruit beer I have tasted to date. Very tasty and possibly underappreciated?
M.J. Barleyhoppers Huckle Weizen;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;M.J. Barleyhoppers;"Portlandrunk and I went to this brewery together, and although neither of us said anything (due to the presence of the bartender) we were both waiting for the other to try this before submitting ourselves to the horribly sweet world fruit beers exist in. This was actually quite good. The ""hint"" of huckleberry was just that, and not only was the flavor pleasing, but there was this very apparent grassiness that added a lot to the beer. It may be the lightest beer at MJ''s but it certaintly isn''t the worst."
M.J. Barleyhoppers Huckle Weizen;Lewiston, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;M.J. Barleyhoppers;Interesting fruit beer. Great huckleberry flavor highlights the beer and is followed with a tinge of bitterness. A very leafy as well as fruity palate to the beer. They have captured the taste of the entire huckleberry plant in this one. First class for a fruit beer.

Very light and easy to drink.
Upland Pale Ale;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Upland Brewing Company;Bottle from Bloomingfoods, Bloomington (among many other places over the years). Not quite as solid as Helios in my opinion, this one always had a raw homebrew kind of character to it. Dry, brashly citric, but with a slight overdose of sweet malts here and there depending on the batch. Crisp and refreshing wins the day, though.

Upland Bad Elmer's Porter;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Porter;Upland Brewing Company;A rather fizzy pour that thins off the head in this dark brown bounty. Aromas boast of chocolate, biscuit and cheap smoke. Flavors light roasted malt, slight wood, slight smoke in the finish. Lacking in complexity and a charater that defines a real porter. To light and east for my taste of a porter. Medium sweet with just a light smoky aftertaste.
Upland Bad Elmer's Porter;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Porter;Upland Brewing Company;Pours opaque coffee with a fair buff head. Aroma delivers roast malt, molasses, and subtle coffee notes.

Aroma is mild chocolate and coffee, mildly roasted (shall I call it ’toasted’?)...some nuts. Pretty good, though not intense by any means. Flavor is even more mild - roasted malt, coffee, mild bitter chocolate - not bad, but not as good as the nose. Medium to light bodied - seems appropriate for the drink. Not bad, but nothing to come running back for!

Court Avenue Capital Raspberry;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Court Avenue Brewing Company;Faintly cloudy golden lacing creamy white head like most of their beers. Potent raspberry aroma and flavor, being medicinally sweet and tart in the mouth. Lacks any richness or clove character. Not too good I did not finish this sampler. Did have a nice creamy feel.

Court Avenue Capital Raspberry;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Court Avenue Brewing Company;Lightly hazed, muted yellow with a creamy cloud of a cover. Nice little berry aroma. Sweeter than I expected, more sugary than berried, but OK.
Court Avenue Capital Raspberry;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Court Avenue Brewing Company;Everyone at our table of legal age had this beer. The aroma of raspberries was there, but not overpowering. Appearance was nothing special, with no head by the time it got to our table. This could be a function of many things. The taste was consistently good from the start to the end. Not overdone with any syrupy level of raspberry, but just the presence. I could drink a couple without growing tired of the raspberry taste. Palate was a little thin, with not a lot of mouthfeel, but adequate to not detract from the enjoyment. The beer was of a dark golden color

Peroni;Roma, Italy;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Birra Peroni Industriale (Asahi);Helder lichtgeel bier met weinig schuim. Smaak is licht bitter en enigszins zoet met een wat rare muffe bijsmaak. Valt zwaar tegen.
Peroni;Roma, Italy;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Birra Peroni Industriale (Asahi);First time I’ve ever seen a canned Peroni so I had to try if there is any difference between a bottle or a can. To be honest it tastes fresher, it seems more crisp and also smells better. Although it’s just a “regular” macro-brewed beer it’s quite good and well balanced, I like this wayyy more than Heineken and Amstel for example. But Hertog Jan still is my number 1 easy-to-drink pale lager/pilsner!
Peroni;Roma, Italy;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Birra Peroni Industriale (Asahi);Blik gekocht tijdens vakantie in Italië. Goudgeel helder bier met een vreemde geur. Schuim trekt snel weg. De smaak is licht moutig. Voor mij is dit een pilsener in de lagere regionen.
Peroni;Roma, Italy;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Birra Peroni Industriale (Asahi);Pours golden with a thick white head. Aroma of rich malt, grass. Taste has floral malt, rich. Palate is much of the same. Much better than a typical international lager.
Peroni;Roma, Italy;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Birra Peroni Industriale (Asahi);Nice refreshing lunchtime beer. Doesn’t taste as strong as its big brother, but we shall see.
Peroni;Roma, Italy;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Birra Peroni Industriale (Asahi);It tastes more like some kind of a corn syrup than beer, but, all in all, I found it very refreshing on hot summer days. It's fine with the Serbian barbecue specialties.
Yellow Rose Bubba Dog;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Bottle. Light sweet malt and paper aroma. Yellow with moderate head. Bland wheat flavor - really nothing unique. Wasn’t really offensive when I drank it but looking at the other ratings, it must have went even more down hill before they went out of business.
Yellow Rose Bubba Dog;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;If this were my dog, I’d friggin’ shoot it. If this were a dog in the pound, I shut the lid on the euthenasia tank myself. Absolutely horrid, with an adjunct that has to be wood chips. The malt tastes like fresh dirt from a junkyard, and the hops scream rancid potatoes. If this is an American wheat, let’s all move to Canada.
Yellow Rose Bubba Dog;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;so when you finally realize that the woman you have been after is just going to keep rejecting you, partly due to some asshole friend who introduces a smooth talking pretty boy into the situation you start thinking you need to suffer, no, you deserve to suffer. because apparently you are not good enough for anyone, so grab a bubba dog, hate yourself, treat yourself like the broken piece of empty crap you feel like, ahh, nothing like a bubba dog with its amber pour and ring of white head to make you feel like you are really paying for your sins. so when you decide you don’t deserve anything good, stick your nose in a glass of this and take in grainy aroma of dead bananas and self pity. oh yeah, now your paying, now you feel the same pain physically that you do emotionally, yeah balance is cool, just take another drink of this twinge inducing beverage. tastes like wood shop. rancid pop tart finish. lingering finish of caramel and slick oily clay. yeah, i’m a worthless piece of crap and this beer goes great with that outlook. but i’m gonna drink the whole damn thing.
Yellow Rose Bubba Dog;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;The name is reasonably befitting for this beer--a Golden Retriever is a dog that is friendly and familiar, if not exceptionally unique. This is a straight-up American wheat, pouring a standard bronze/brown with a middling head. Unremarkable and reclusive aroma, perhaps a bit cardboardy but otherwise lacking the sour edge that sometimes troubles Great Grains beers. Some malty hints, slightly caramel, watery, with a late metallic twinge. Decent carbonation, giving it a bit of life. Not a terrible beer at all, just run-of-the-mill like your average Golden Retriever.
Yellow Rose Bubba Dog;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Poured hazy brownish amber with mild off white head...smell is malty and is indeed of cardboard...taste is thin and watery and nutty...metallic and fizzy...not good at all...
Yellow Rose Bubba Dog;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;"Bottle pours a very cloudy unfilterd honey color with a huge coarse foamy white head that is maintained very well. Aromsa are of honey and cardboard, light malts and a little fruity hops. The flavors leave much to be desired. Metallic, rusty burnt. Just all around not good. ""This award winning beer"" WTH !?! Still, thanks to Kaggie97 for this unique brew. Hey Cool! My new loest ever rating. W00t"
Yellow Rose Bubba Dog;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Bottle. HUGE foamy head on a hazy gold body. Smells like really sweet roting fruit. Taste up front is simpily of a bad wheat, but the aftertaste is bad wheat plus vinegar. This is the last straw. Great Grains needs to throw the towel in. Their beers suck ass.
Yellow Rose Bubba Dog;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;"Hmmm, I never would have guessed that something called ""Bubba Dog"" would be my 100th brew. As the bottle states, this is a foggy pour. It is decently heady and is not overpouring to the nose. It has decent taste, however it is noticeably hollow. An OK lawnmower beer, but not a recommended beer for body and unique palate."
Yellow Rose Bubba Dog;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Pours like apple cider with no head or lacing. The aroma is sourish and fruity. Slick and undercarbonated body, with a really unpleasant flavor. I didn't even know this was supposed to be a wheat beer. The flavor is kind of what a Flemish Sour would taste like if it sat out for a couple days. It is just sour and fruity throughout. The finish is fruity like cider and the tart sourness lingers. So far the Yellow Rose beers have been thorough disappointments.
Yellow Rose Bubba Dog;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Smells like a compost heap full of old rotting vegetables. Thin as hell, mouthfeel (not taste) like weak coffee, with no carbonation.. seems like a mixture of 1/2 beer and 1/2 water. Tastes like bland notebook paper and tobacco, with an absolutely empty and awful finish. Tastes like dirty dish water left in a sink.
Free State Ad Astra Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Bottle poured i to a shaker. Pours caramel color with a quickly dissolving off white head. Mostly caramel on a very light aroma. Initial taste is a hint of caramel malt with watered down pine hops. Aftertaste is mild, toasty, and unremarkable. Watery palate and light carbonation. Well, it's beer...
Free State Ad Astra Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Free State Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle. Poured dark amber with an off white head. Aroma was caramel, toast, brown sugar. Taste was light sweet, toasted grains, malty, caramel malt, light burnt sugar. Okay.
Free State Ad Astra Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Free State Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Filtered amber-brown-red body. Foamy, glass rimming head. A pretty classic, doughy Amber. Most brewers don't even attempt this style anymore, and this has more of a feel of a good amber of 15 years back than most on the market in 2017. Big caramel malt tones, could benefit from a little more aggressive hopping. OK.
Free State Ad Astra Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Free State Brewing Company;12floz bottle with a BBD 05.31.2017 imprinted on the neck. Looks about as amazing as a beer can get. A one-finger head settles to a frothy half-finger leaving webs as the dark-copper body lowers with each drink. Smells good too, consisting of toasted caramel and mossy earthiness. This is carries through in the easy going palate. An excellent American altbier/amber ale as it is a very well composed malt centric ale.
Free State Ad Astra Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Free State Brewing Company;From a bottle into pint glass. Amber color, big beige head. Mostly molasses on the nose. sweet, well balanced, medium carbonation. Solid satiated, solid beer.
Free State Ad Astra Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Free State Brewing Company;I get it, there’s lots of American Amber Ales out there, but to my mind, Ad Astra is underrated. Deep amber pour with a light brown head and lacing. Biscuit and toffee aromas from the toasted malt. Flavor goes with what you smell. You also get some caramel. Tea and apricot hop flourishes, too. The hops are present, but the bitterness is kept low. Smooth and partially creamy mouthfeel. A paradigm-shifter? No. A tasty beer? Absolutely.
Free State Ad Astra Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Pretty good Amber. Malt, caramel, toffee, biscuit, some fruitiness. Down the middle of the plate.
Free State Ad Astra Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Free State Brewing Company;APPEARANCE- Dark amber color, in the darker range for an Amber ale, which like. Head is nice, and laces well. FLAVOR- clean drinking ale flavor. Very little hop is evident (bittering or aroma).NOTES-This one surprised me a bit. It?s better than I anticipated.
Free State Ad Astra Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Free State Brewing Company;"Weird mineral, slightly astringent aroma with some Sugar Daddy caramel lurking within; amber color, pale beige crown; toffee and caramel, brown sugar, fruity/berry quality in the middle, dried dates and other fruits; earthy bitterness in the finish, balanced overall; light medium body, ample carbonation; tastes far better than it smells, solid amber ale."
Free State Ad Astra Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Pours an amber brown color with a khaki head. Caramel, toffee, biscuit, toast and light fruit aroma. Caramel, toffee, biscuit, toast, floral, slight fruit and nut flavor with a bit of astringency. Medium light body and medium carbonation. Astringent caramel finish.
Free State Belgian Wheat;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Dark yellow with a fluffy white head. Sweet malty cereal grain citrus and light earthy spice aroma and taste.
Free State Belgian Wheat;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Growler, purchased for me at the brewpub by Gregis. I brought this to a friend’s BBQ Saturday night, and shared a few glasses around. The beer was generally well received, with a few people pretty excited about how distinctive it was. Pour is a very hazy golden auburn with a very white head. Really nice lacing left behind on the Pils glass I was using. Aroma is cloves, coriander and a bit of Belgian yeast sweetness. Nose was somewhere between a Wit and a Hefe for me. Taste is light and refreshing with the spices represented in the nose along with a full wheatiness. This beer worked really well on a hot summer evening. However, the lighter body led to a bit less definition in the taste. As with the nose, the taste was somewhere in between a Wit and a Hefe, which I liked. Thanks for bringing this one from Lawrence for me Greg, always appreciated.
Free State Belgian Wheat;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Poured from a growler. The pour is hazy dark straw yellow with a snow white head. Nice lace. I get coriander up front in the nose. Every now and then I pick up a whiff of the orange peel. There’s some other spice notes that I’m guessing is from the yeast. The flavor is pretty light, and I must say uninspiring. Some coriander and orange are there, but they seem kind of muddled. Not as sharp as I’d like them. Even a bit soapy. Medium body with lots of carbonation. This isn’t all that bad of a beer, but its not all that good either. It just left me wanting more.
Free State Belgian Wheat;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Free State Brewing Company;"On tap at the brewpub.. Pours a hazy lemonade yellow with a thin cap of white head. Citrus, wheat and a faint coriander on the nose; less citric than many wits. The mouthfeel is thin, soft and lightly dry; noticeably smoother than a lot of the wits that I’ve sampled. The flavor also deviates a bit from the typical formula for this style. Not as sweet as I’d expected, the flavor is wheat, orange and coriander with a dry coriander finish. Rather than leaning on the citrus, this beer goes more towards the spice and ends with a slightly funky finish. I found it a decent witbier but I won’t order it again."
Free State Belgian Wheat;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Decent, makes for a nice beer to drink during the hot summer days. A bit of a sticky soapy flavor, with some really nice fruitiness, rinds perhaps a bit of corriander and clove. Nice!
Free State Belgian Wheat;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub, 7/3/06: Hazy yellow with a foamy film. Yeasty to be sure, this is slippery smooth with a light orange-iness shining through. OK.
Free State Belgian Wheat;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Free State Brewing Company;On tap: A great summer beer, I also thought it had a little more flavor than your typical Belgian witbeir. I really enjoyed this, another winner from Free State. The oargne and coriander are very noticable, the honey is a nice undertone. A little bit mild, or plain dispite the notes of spice mixed in there, but overall another very good brew from Free State. Some serious bubble gum flavors and aroma.
Free State Belgian Wheat;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Draft. Hazy gold, off white, somewhat rocky head. Nose is corriander, wheat, with some muted yeastiness. Taste is spicy with soft wheat flavors and some mid and late citrus. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth. I didn’t know that oats were added until after I had it, that would help explain the great mouthfeel. Nice wit.
Free State Belgian Wheat;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Draft: Dull lemon. Ever so hazy. Retentive, rocky wisp of foam. Flowery hops, orange peels, and rose petals in the aroma. Hint of hay as it warms. Juicy texture mirrors the grittiness. Notably creamy carbonation. Early toasted hay sweetness tempers the honeydew melon onrush. Sensuously soft orange peel, floral hop, and rose petal mélange. Glimmering grassy herb notes, as well, and a restrained note of crushed coriander. Quenching lemony acidity cuts the starchy wheat and filmy oat notes before finishing with a balanced flurry of floral hops, chalky yeast, and fresh dried orange peels. Rather plain-spoken, but the degree of refinement, cleanliness, and dryness largely distinguish it from last year’s catastrophic example.
Free State Belgian Wheat;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Citrusy aroma, cloudy pale appearance, a little to sweet....................
Free State Bison Dark Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Old Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Draft: Clear walnut with ruby highlights. Frothy light caramel head. Elegant aroma equally loaded with fruity esters, chocolate, caramel, nuts, and cream. Substantially hoppy with a hint of maple and buttery yeast. Soft and mellow on the tongue. Fruity start is balanced by a healthy fresh hop tingle and a long pale malt, caramel malt composition. Ringwood yeast hints. Persistent caramel malt, dark malt finish with a coarse hint of leather and accompanying hop belches. Exactly what I seek in the style.
Free State Bison Dark Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Old Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Medium dark brown with and orange hue at the edge of the glass. Frothy tan head... hoppy, rich and creamy, very sweet and rich, like drinking espresso or french roast. The roasted malts are picked up, and the roasty chocolate flavor coats the mouth. A great beer from Free State. Enjoyed this with lilannie, ChimayBabe and TAR passing through on my way to Chicago.
Free State Bison Dark Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Old Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Free State does so many different styles well. This ale is no exception. Caramel-fruit flavor and huge hops balanced by a ton of nutty, dark malts. Some banana-y esters noted. Quickly disappearing head with average lacing. Nutty dark malts with some fruity caramel. Bit of fitting diacetyl.
Free State Bison Dark Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Old Ale;Free State Brewing Company;"Nice strong ale. Very fruity for such a dark beer; I tasted raisins, and, discordingly, lighter fruits such as peaches and apples. The hop varieties I have honestly never heard of, but finish off the tremendous malt complexity that this beer offers. Looks simply great in the glass."
Free State Bison Dark Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Old Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Dark red in color, roasted carmel, full body, not much head................
Free State Bison Dark Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Old Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Great dark, slightly strong ale. Deep, dark red color, slight head and relatively low carbonation, Great marriage of maltiness and hop spiciness. Incredible bittersweet aftertaste. Well done again, Free State.
Free State Brinkley's Maibock;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Free State Brewing Company;I had this at Flying Saucer in KC. Pours copper with thin white head.

There was a very small white head that didn’t linger long nor leave any lacing. The aroma is good, with notes of the malts, fruits, grass and some earthiness. The taste is good. Malty, with a good hop balance. Fruits and some mustiness to the taste. An easy drinker. I would definitely buy again!
Free State Crimsonberry Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Free State Brewing Company;Had on tap at the brewpub while visiting the university. Nice. Probably their best beer while I was visiting.
Free State Crimsonberry Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Free State Brewing Company;12 oz draft at the 20th anniversary party for Free State. Pour is hazed golden with a 1/2 inch white head. Nice lacing. Aroma of sweet blueberry, cranberry and raspberry. Bit of lemon with some sugar. Some wheat behind that in the nose. Taste is syrupy berry (the same as the nose in this order) cranberry - raspberry - blueberry, all with more sweetness than tartness. Not really natural tasting, after the sweetness is the grainy earth wheat, which was actually quite nice. Some tart sour jumps out at the end. Grassy grainy thin medium palate. Clean finish.
Free State Crimsonberry Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Free State Brewing Company;Excellent aroma and appearance. Best fruit beer I’ve had because the fruit flavor is a perfect balance between sweet and tart. The right amount and mixture of berries make for a pleasant fruit flavor and excellent level of alcohol.
Free State Crimsonberry Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Free State Brewing Company;5oz sample. Hazy gold with a finger high, off white head. Aroma is berries, in fact pretty much a good combonation of the berries used (cranberry, raspberry, blueberry) Mouthfeel is not too bad at first, but thin at the back. Initial taste is mildly tart berries, mostly cranberry, with a touch of wheat. The finish is sourish and a bit tart. Not bad, but not good.
Free State Crimsonberry Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Free State Brewing Company;On Tap: Loved the aroma and taste, I was very suprised by the tartness of the cran and raspberries. Probably the best fruit beer I’ve had, if not best, the best redberry. Also a very pretty beer. Standard gold color with just off-white head.
Free State Crimsonberry Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Free State Brewing Company;Nothing crimson about the color- light with a foamy head. Aprreciable wheat content, but the gravity makes it a little underpowered. Seedy aftertaste would suggest that they use real berries and not fruit extract.
Free State Crimsonberry Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Free State Brewing Company;Very natural aroma and flavor. Much more subtle and upscale than the other cranberry-based beer I've tried (Sam Adams Lambic). Delicious and slightly creamy.
Free State Crimsonberry Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Free State Brewing Company;An amazing fruit wheat beer with a great balance of sweet, sour, yeast, and hops. It’s hard to beat Free State wheat beers. A great biergarten selection from a wonderful brewery!
Free State Crimsonberry Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Free State Brewing Company;"If there's a better fruit wheat out there I haven't met it. Many of these kinds of beers get so bogged down with fruit that it winds up tasting like vaguely yeasty kool-aid; this one gets it right. A great, crisp wheat, with just enough berry to make it incredibly refreshing. Great carbonation, too."
Free State Crimsonberry Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Free State Brewing Company;Lightly tart, fruity and flowery aroma, quite berryish indeed with just a hint of wheat. Faintly hazy lighter golden color, head is slight but leaves some nice lacing behind. Flavor is citric, sweet, tart and juicy, again plenty of berry flavor coming through. Refreshing and lightly acidic on the palate, light-medium bodied. Not too sweet, plenty of real fruit flavor to accent the light wheat ale base. Very little hops or bitterness. Nice fruit beer, very refreshing.
Free State Cyclone Black Lager;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Free State Brewing Company;"Fresh growler from the brewpub. Pours a deep, deep brown with two inches of thick tan head: a creamy pillow from the top with large pits when viewed from the side. I’ve never seen a schwarzbier with head retention like this one. When it eventually recedes, it deposits patchy lace in its wake. The nose is a blend of toasty cara-Munich and chocolaty malt notes with supporting spicy/herbal and floral hop notes. Light-bodied and fairly thin with a drying, roasty and mineral-forward finish, the palate is not at all what my brain was expecting, especially given its appearance. It’s a bit sour and a touch astringent at the finish, as well. The flavor is equally ""off"" from the expectations created by the pleasant aroma: up front, there’s a heavy mineral-water base that gives way to a roasted malt (burnt chocolate and Munich) and ""green"" hop combination that remains a bit disjointed even as my tongue acclimates to it toward the bottom of the pint. I’ve come to expect Free State to produce ""above-average"" to"" truly stunning"" examples of whatever lager style they attempt. While I’m sure that skewed my expectations for this beer, the bottom line is that I’m just not diggin’ this one."
Free State Cyclone Black Lager;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Free State Brewing Company;Black with a fizzy tan head. Roasted grain and light chocolate aroma and taste with a big coffee bite.
Free State Cyclone Black Lager;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Free State Brewing Company;10 oz draft at the brew pub in Lawrence, Kansas. Pour is black, touch of brown with a well formed 1/2 inch light khaki head. Nice lacing coats the glass as it drinks down. Aroma is roast malt, along with some light cream chocolate sweetness. Taste is the lightly sweet cream chocolate, followed close behind by a muted char taste, finishing with dry pine and mineral. Palate is medium bodied, coats the mouth initially than clears with the drier finish. Decent Schwarz, not quite as clean as other recent Free State Lagers.
Free State Cyclone Black Lager;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Free State Brewing Company;Draft: Light prune liquid. Spiderweb lavework. Lovely aroma of raisin, toffee, glazed pecan, cocoa, and concord grape. Undertones of earth and chocolate. Firm, snappy carbonation. Very toffeeish. Starts mildly roasted with notes of toasted marshmallow, followed by a green, floral german hop snap. Big notes of caramel-coated coffee bean, nutty bread aspects, chocolate, toffee, and vanilla in the resounding finish. A truly impressive piece of work.
Free State Cyclone Black Lager;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Free State Brewing Company;Chestnut color with a a stable light tan head. Aromas of griany malt and a hint of cocoa. Grainy extract flavors with a small hops bite near the end.
Free State Cyclone Black Lager;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Free State Brewing Company;"Malty goodness, cherry cordial colored. Caramel taste and texture...very smooth.

Free State Grace OMalleys Irish Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Free State Brewing Company;Malty. A heavy beer for it’s size. I’m getting some scottish taste to this, but not enough to turn me off. A nice seasonal to have in March.
Free State Grace OMalleys Irish Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Free State Brewing Company;Draught @ Brewpub: Interesting pour. It has a bit of the Guinness-like cascade going on with it. It pours a coppery-amber color, which ended up being almost clear. Needless to say, it ended up with a decent size off-white head that leaves some lacing. There is a hint of roastiness to the nose. Earthy, grassy hops predominate the aroma, with some caramel also. It has a decent malt body, with a slightly dry taste. Very little sweetness to it. This is a very good beer!
Free State Grace OMalleys Irish Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Free State Brewing Company;Growler shared with theisti. Pours reddish-brown with a thin skin of off-white head. On the nose are: caramel, flowers and a faint peat note in the background. Light to medium-bodied and slick with a clean, lightly dry finish. This one tastes like a blend of about two-thirds Irish ale (caramel malt base) and one-third Scottish ale (peaty smoked malt). This is a solid and tasty session beer.
Free State Grace OMalleys Irish Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Free State Brewing Company;Growler generously shared by Gregis. Pour is clear orange amber with an off white 1 inch head. Some pretty lacing on the glass. Aroma of malty, earthy, floral hop with some distant sweetness - brown sugar. Taste has the smokiness from the nose, but none of the sweetness. Some bitter, almost ear waxy hoppiness to the body / finish. This was interesting, nicely made. Thanks for bringing this one over, Greg!
Free State Hefe Weizen;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Free State Brewing Company;A middling hefeweizen. It has a bit more hop bite than the standard banana and clove bomb, but otherwise standard. Tried for the first time back in 2008.
Free State Hefe Weizen;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Free State Brewing Company;32 ounce growler. Pours a mostly clear pale gold with a decent white head. Mild aroma of fruit, malt, and spice. Taste is lemon, spice, malt, and grain. Hardly any banana. Very, very mild.
Free State Hefe Weizen;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Free State Brewing Company;Draft in a sampler at the brewpub. Pours a hazy, pale yellow-gold with a finger of soft, resilient bone white head. Aroma of bready malts, banana, bubblegum, coriander, and wheat. The flavor is identical, with just a hint of lemon citrus. Light-medium bodied, with a soft, bready, wheaty, estery mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Sweet take on a hefe.
Free State Hefe Weizen;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Free State Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub - looks like a hefe alright - sadly, that’s as good as it gets - aroma and flavor are very sweet and sugary for a hefe - loads of banana and fruity esters - some undercurrents of off phenols - just a touch of spice, but overall really just too sweet to be enjoyable.
Free State Hefe Weizen;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Free State Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. On tap in August 2009. Pours a hazy light apricot color with a white head. Starts out at about two fingers but dies down quickly without all that much lace. The nose brings a lot of clove with just a bit if banana. The yeast is a bit more quiet in the taste with a light amount of semisweet malt. Pretty good body and nice drinkability on a hot summer day. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 11-11-2010
Free State Hefe Weizen;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Free State Brewing Company;Growler filled five days prior (at the brewpub). Pours a hazy dark straw with a dense, fluffy, meringue-like white head with sticky cascading lace. The nose is of big banana esters and soft, sweet wheat. The banana note is so pronounced it’s almost like straight banana extract or banana Now & Later candy. Light-bodied and wheaty with a lightly astringent sourness at the back sides of your tongue. Soft, light, sour wheat with a solid, yeasty, banana backing and a touch of spiciness (clove?) at the finish. This is a solid hefeweizen. I’d certainly order it again.
Free State Hefe Weizen;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Free State Brewing Company;Pint @ brewpub. Pours a completely hazy, cannot see through it, golden/thick yellow color. Has a nicely sticky lacing as well. Aroma is candy sweet bubblegum. A bit sweeter smelling than standard Hefe. Taste is slightly less bubblegum and more just sweet candy. With a light herbalness in the aftertaste. Hey I like estery brews and this is definitely got plenty of that.
Free State Hefe Weizen;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Free State Brewing Company;Poured from a growler into my ,4 liter Kulmbacher glass. Growler was generously transported from the brewpub to my house by csbosox. Pour is hazy straw yellow and orange with a big white head. Nice thick lacing left behind as the head retreats. There are a bunch of carbonation bubbles clung on all sides of the glass. Bubbles rise to the top as well. Aroma of bready wheat toast, perfumey lemon citrus and bubble gum. The bubble gum comes on last but certainly is the strongest. Taste is the wheat, with a touch of lemon citrus and standard Hefe yeastiness. Palate is medium. Overall a nice hefe. Thanks for being my Free State mule, Chris.
Free State Hefe Weizen;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Free State Brewing Company;Hazy straw yellow with a big white head. Very corny nose. Some spicey phenols, but where in the hell is the banana? Grassy and some pepper flavor. Dry finish. Blah.
Free State Hefe Weizen;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Free State Brewing Company;Overall pretty mild in the typical hefe spice notes. Not really memorable at all.

Free State Hop Jack Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Free State Brewing Company;Citra version 10oz long thin tulip glass. Beer pours beautifully with a frothy head and a definitely unfiltered, dark orange color that allows little clarity. Aroma is fresh and crisp with tangy, light, citrus hops. The hops are accompanied well in the flavor with a malt backbone that is present but does not get in the way of the hops. Goes down easy. German Norther Brewer Similar score, the floral/herbal hops work well with this malt bill as well. Calypso This was by far the least interesting. It felt like there were less hops or the hops were more subtle, can’t pinpoint exactly the defining character of this hop.
Free State Invigorator Doppel Bock;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Free State Brewing Company;Not bad, though it can’t compare with the top shelf doppelbocks. Doesn’t have the same rich, thick flavor. This has a nice caramel and toffee background. Tried at the brewery.

Initially tastes sweet and full-bodied, but as the flavour develops the sweetness is balanced by a nutty hop character, lots of malt, a hint of roastiness and a dry alcoholic bite. The finish is dry and gently bitter

The nose is a sweet, malty brown sugar and raisin. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium-bodied with a lightly metallic feel on the tongue, transitioning to a fairly dry and mildly astringent finish. Sweet malty raisin and caramel with a hint of alcohol at the finish. A solid Doppelbock but it’s probably not one that I’m inclined to order again. My opinion is probably tainted by the fact that I drank a Paulaner Salvator and Sprecher Doppel the night before sampling this one, but I just wasn’t blown away by this one.
Free State Invigorator Doppel Bock;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Free State Brewing Company;On draught at the brewpub, pours a clear dark amber with a slight head.

Free State Ironman Imperial Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Free State Brewing Company;"Aroma is a little weak. Standard Imperial Stout scent, but muted and with a strange red wine vinegar characteristic. The appearance is nice - flat black color with a tiny cap of tan foam that leaves a lot of lacing. Nice creamy flavor with a welcome sweetness that opens up before giving way to hops and roasty bitterness. Booze burn in the aftertaste; I have never taken away points from a beer for that. Great palate, thick yet smooth. This beer was good, not great."

Free State John Brown Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Brown Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Pretty mild brown ale.

Aroma of toasted and caramel malts, brown sugar-tosted nuts, vanilla, and chocolate. The flavor hits pretty much all the same notes, getting sweeter as it warms.

Free State John Brown Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Brown Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Pours a dark brown with a very malty aroma. Taste is slightly bland with not much going on flavor wise.

Free State Janes ESB;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Free State Brewing Company;Very nice tatse of hops in this ESB. Finish is very smooth. The here is very good to and goes well with the beers!!
Free State Janes ESB;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Free State Brewing Company;This is a fine beer, but as the commercial description implies, this really is not that different from Copperhead. A bit too citric in character to be a proper English ESB. BTW, the hops recipe has changed: They use Fuggles and Horizon hops now.
Free State Janes ESB;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Free State Brewing Company;I don't like the sour edge this one seemed to have. It goes beyond bitter and tart, into the nether regions of sour. I like the Copperhead more, the hops in that brew seem to be better balanced.
Free State Janes ESB;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Free State Brewing Company;Mahogany/dark amber color. Filtered. Nice carbonation, a slight yet uneven head and some rather thick lacing. The aroma is very slightly fruity, but is mostly hoppy. I believe the recipe for this brew has changed slightly, as in the description above it is stated that only E. Kent Goldings are used, whereas on the menu last night the mix was noted to be Goldings, Fuggles, and Victory. Anyhoo, there is a certain caramel sweetness to this beer, along with the same slight fruitiness found in the aroma. This beer has great balance. The hoppy flavors come in right at the right time. Medium-bodied beer. Finish is quite smooth, with a slightly spicy aftertaste. O.G. - 1058, 50 IBUs.

Free State Lemongrass Rye;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Free State Brewing Company;From fresh Growler, Bright yellow with a thin white crisp head. The rye adds great thick mouthfeel which is hides the lightness of this beer. Not super lemony but enough to bring out the spice of the rye. Super refreshing for a hot day of mowing the lawn while still having enough bite and weight to make it worth it
Free State Lemongrass Rye;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Free State Brewing Company;"Growler procured by beastiefan2k. Thanks for snagging this for me, Eugene. Pours a surprisingly clear dark gold with a creamy white head and nice lacing. This looks nothing like any other rye that I’ve sampled. The nose is of pale and biscuity malt with a touch of rye spiciness and some citrus and herbal/floral notes in the background. On the light side of medium-bodied, the mouthfeel is silky soft (almost like it came off cask) with a touch of light spiciness at the finish; super drinkable. The flavor is of pale and biscuity malt with a supporting rye spiciness and a bright yet well integrated lemony floral note. Time and again Steve puts out supremely drinkable session beers, and this one is no exception. This is one growler I will have no troubles polishing off by myself. :)"
Free State Lemongrass Rye;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Free State Brewing Company;Cloudy amber with a off white foam,fruity esterey ,wheat like I didnt get the rye but the lemongrass was nice citrusy and clovery I bet they had tamed it down from previous batches.Easy drinking and my wifes favorite of the day

Free State Lemongrass Rye;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Free State Brewing Company;On Tap: This was one of my favorite Free State beers. Very easy to drink, and quite enjoyable. The appearence is a light golden color with a tiny white ring around the top and some nice carbonation throughout. The aroma is lemony, grassy, (not to sound too stupid considering the name), hops, citrus, etc. The taste is a touch of malts, just enough to offset the hops, citrus and other great flavors. I enjoyed it.
Free State Lemongrass Rye;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Free State Brewing Company;Nothing offensive about this beer at all. Crystal clear. Golden. Light lemon. Soft on the palate, with some rye spice. I’d love to have this available all the time.

The aroma is sweet roasted oats and chocolate malt. The flavor is sweet roasted malt and some black licorice and fruit with an ashy bitter finish. The mouthfeel is rather thin and watery and nitro like. Overall, a nice oatmeal stout. I remember liking this more last time I had it.
Free State Oatmeal Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Free State Brewing Company;"Drank right from the bottle; big thanks, moody. Has a big dark presentation. Could be a sweet stout but it tries to get into the more bitter stout or even looking at impy stout with its 6% and all shit. Yes, big and almost bold, but never quite gitz-thar. Goes down pretty easy, somewhat bitter burnt damp wet fire wood that was put out a couple of days ago, just not quire charcoal. Even has some attributes of baltic porter. Gets better as the session continues thru the middle but becomes a tad medicinal in the end."
Free State Oatmeal Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Free State Brewing Company;Bottle, thanks to Unclemike.

Free State Octoberfest;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Free State Brewing Company;Taster at brewpub. Pours light brown with a white head. Leaves trace lacing in the glass. Solid malt notes on the nose. This beer seems to coat the tongue with a thin layer of maltiness. Finished clean. Not my favorite style but it’s very quaffable.
Free State Octoberfest;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Free State Brewing Company;Draft @ Free State - clear copper with a white head. This might be the best Märzen I’ve ever had. Great ready malty sweetness, spicy bitterness, but not too much. Very nice!!
Free State Octoberfest;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Free State Brewing Company;Reddish, mostly clear pour with somewhat lasting foam. Bread and malt in the nose with some richness, perhaps chocolately. Flavor follows, but the spice gives the finish some bitterness. Medium body, mild fizz.

Free State Old Backus Barleywine;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Free State Brewing Company;Fully depends on the year. Last one I had was from 2016 (I think) and it was undrinkably sweet. Prior years had been awesome, though.
Free State Old Backus Barleywine;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Free State Brewing Company;Pours a dark copper with off white head. Malty forward aroma, sweet.

Good stuff. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Free State Old Backus Barleywine;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Free State Brewing Company;I didn't get the burbon taste at all. Strong toffee taste. Just a little bit of a head. Tried this because i was told it was a very popular beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Free State Old Backus Barleywine;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Free State Brewing Company;Free State’s Old Backus is a malt bomb with lots of class. It pours brown. It has a nose that leans heavily toward toasted malt sugar - brown sugar, caramel, and cooked fruit. Caramel, molasses, butterscotch, vanilla, chocolate, stone fruits, and dark fruits make up the flavor profile. While this definitely leans more toward the English malt-forward style, you still get some zesty hops toward the finish. Gorgeous stuff.
Free State Old Backus Barleywine;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Free State Brewing Company;6 oz pour from chilled bottle into sniffer. Deep burnt orange, opaque, weak off-white head. Nose of plum, stone fruit, raisin, a little apricot, caramelization. Body is syrupy, thick, a little carbonation on the finish.

Free State Owd Macs Imperial Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Free State Brewing Company;2013 22-oz. bottle. Solid nose of charred oak, molasses, mild bourbon, and heavy milk chocolate. Pours flat dark brown. Nice, balanced taste of whiskey (solid heat to start), cocoa, oak, light vanilla, a touch of raisin, and some tobacco. The alcohol burn increases as the beer warms but never hits overpowering levels. Medium body with a slightly prickly texture. A delicious top-drawer barrel-aged stout.
Free State Owd Macs Imperial Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Free State Brewing Company;Bottle shared by Eugene as part of a blind BA imperial stout tasting. Dark reddish brown pour was the lightest of the bunch. Nose brings chocolate, vanilla, touch of oak, and with perceptable alcohol. Some oxidation, more chocolate than roast, but pretty much right at the center of the flavor profile I’d expect from an imperial stout + barrel. Just doesn’t really gel for me the way I’d expect -- like all the parts are nicely there, but somehow the sum is less. Wish there was still some left this morning for me to give it another shot, though.
Free State Owd Macs Imperial Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Free State Brewing Company;Growler during RBWG Grand Tasting. Pours a very dark brown with medium tan head that lasts. The aroma is roasted malts, cocoa, and booze.

Free State Post Rock Pilsner;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Free State Brewing Company;Pours a clear golden yellow with a white head. Aroma of light floral hops, sweet fruits, and malt. Flavor is sweet, almost tangy with lots of fruity notes, also some pale malts. A good albeit unusual pilsener.
Free State Post Rock Pilsner;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Free State Brewing Company;12 oz bottle pours golden with a white head. Aroma of grass, grains and caramel. taste is malts and grains
Free State Post Rock Pilsner;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Free State Brewing Company;This is a pretty solid pilsener by any standard. Golden and hazy. Thin, white head. Aroma is super light lemon. Has a very nice, grassy hop body. Nice amount of bitterness. Tried for the first time years ago at the brewery. Now they're bottling it and I can't believe I've never rated it before.
Free State Post Rock Pilsner;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Free State Brewing Company;12oz bottle. A solid offering. Grassy, dry, with a crackery clean malt backdrop. Almost has a touch of lemony Sorachi Ace type of a feel..but I guess it is all Saaz. There is something not quite perfect about it...doesn't really have any nice lagering tone. Better than a typical US Pils, would like to try it on tap.
Free State Post Rock Pilsner;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Free State Brewing Company;Sampler at brewpub. Pours golden and clear with a white head. Leaves some lacing in the glsss. Has some grass notes on the nose and tongue. Finished clean. Solid example of style.
Free State Post Rock Pilsner;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Free State Brewing Company;12floz bottle, BBD: 09.22.2017, paid $9 for a six-pack, and poured this bottle’s contents into a nonic glass. Bubbles rise in the middle of the golden body to support a thick half finger of foam. Very nice nose consists of herbs, grass, and hay. This is a very fine Americanized pilsner. The hops are fresh providing vibrancy, and cereal grains provide just enough of a base to to lend a bit of grit. The body is light, but flavor flavor is maximum in this pilsner. More traditional than what most American craft brewers produce as pilsners. I approve.
Free State Post Rock Pilsner;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Free State Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Comes a clear light gold with a nice white head. Aroma of malt, grain, and grass. Taste is sweet malt, grain, grass, and citrus. Nice Pilsener.

Free State Post Rock Pilsner;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Free State Brewing Company;On tap, minimal smell, some sweet maltiness. Smooth malts and a little floral hops go down easy. There is some herbal dryness in the finish with a rough grainy palate. As it gets warmer it gets more grainy and oily and less smooth. ok beer.
Free State Populist Porter;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Porter;Free State Brewing Company;"On tap at the brewpub. Pours dark brown with a thin creamy head that laces nicely. On the nose are roast, chocolate, nuts and citric hops; an interesting blend. Light to medium-bodied and oily with a slick transition to a roasted and mildly bitter finish. Medium roasted malt, nuts and light chocolate with moderately earthy and citric hops at the lingering finish. This is a nice porter, one that I’d recommend it to any fan of the style."
Free State Populist Porter;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Porter;Free State Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Brown in color with a tan head. Nice chocolate and citrus aroma. Same with the flavor. Sort of thin palate. Really a nice beer. Could have drank several pints.
Free State Populist Porter;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Porter;Free State Brewing Company;The beers at Free State change. The beer I had today was different than the beer Indra had in 2001 and is probably closer to the beer cb and grant had in 2003. This beer just went on tap recently and I loved it. On to the review. Dark brown with reddish tints. Aroma is hoppy! The hops seem to be citrusy, they smell great. The taste is roasted malt -> hops flavor. The hops flavor lingers with a slight bitterness. Nice finish. Mouthfeel is nice, about right for a porter. I kinda think they got it right here. I like hoppy porters, this isn’t by any means a super hopped beer like a Alpha Klaus, but the hops really go weel with the malt.
Free State Populist Porter;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Porter;Free State Brewing Company;A mediocre offering from FS. Not bitter, but sour. A citrus flavor overwhelmed everything else good about this beer, except the aroma which was the consummate coffee/chocolate. I don't think I'll be getting this one again.
Free State Populist Porter;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Porter;Free State Brewing Company;"This is an oddball beer: not really a porter at all. At first ""sip,"" one tastes the maltiness expected in a porter. Then the hops hit you. This is, first off, definitely overhopped to be a ""porter."" This is not really a problem; I like dry, hoppy porters if they're done right. It just doesn't seem to come together in this beer. The aroma is GRAPEFRUIT, the flavor is GRAPEFRUIT. It seems like they used a lot of one kind of hop. Body and mouthfeel is a bit thin, although the appearance is quite satisfactory. It's an alright beer, but not nearly as good as Free State is capable of producing."
Free State Populist Porter;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Porter;Free State Brewing Company;"Very chocolatey aroma. Filtered; very dark red-brown. Somewhat minimal head and carbonation. Very nice roasty chocolatey, coffeeish flavors, with a somewhat chewy mouthfeel. Aftertaste is roasty as well, with the hop flavors being pushed way to the back. I kind of wish more hops were there to give it a more interesting character, but it's smooth. Good porter."
Free State Prairie Pale Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;IPA;Free State Brewing Company;Thanks to hopdog for sharing this from a growler he got in a trade with mreusch. Pours a lightly hazy golden orange with a bubbly/creamy off white head that left some lacing. Aroma of cereal grains, floral and citrus hops, bready and hints of iced tea. Flavor of hop flavor, bready/cereal malts, some caramel and citrus.
Free State Prairie Pale Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;IPA;Free State Brewing Company;Growler acquired in trade with mreusch (thanks!). Poured a medium and hazy orangish color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas of citrus, floral, tea, and lightly spicey. Tastes of citrus, orange peels, toasted caramel, and lightly earthy.
Free State Prairie Pale Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;IPA;Free State Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Suprised by the lack of aroma in this beer. The flavor was, for me, better balanced than the Copperhead I had just prior. Stong hop flavor with all the citrus, piney notes but strong mouthfeel and toasty malts as well. Quite good.
Free State Prairie Pale Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;IPA;Free State Brewing Company;"Tap @ FS, pours a clear golden with a slight amber tint, nice white head and good lacing. Hoppy aroma is pine/resin, grass, citrus, and slight lemon. Flavor is a nice bite that lingers, with more fresh hops, and a lively palate. Another well done IPA from FS; well received on a hot and muggy summer evening."
Free State Prairie Pale Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;IPA;Free State Brewing Company;Draft (Styrian Goldings version): Light golden color. Sticky, finely layered bright white foam wisp. Toasted malt husk, peppery/minty hop aroma with apple hints. Silky carbonation. Moderately grainy. Brash hop textures clash with the buttery yeast. Overt huskiness wreaks havoc on the palate. Unbalanced with only a sparse amount of florally-juicy/honeysuckle Styrian traits. Ends dryly woody and coarsely earthy with dirty yeast flavors muddling the soft hop whispers. The mere trace of bright hop burps fails to offer any redemption. Good, but with Styrians being one of my favorite hops, this was a letdown.
Free State Prairie Pale Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;IPA;Free State Brewing Company;O.G. 15.15/1061, 55IBU. On tap at the bar. Orange-gold color with a thin head. Nice lacing. Nice hoppy aroma. Citrus peels, some honey? notes. Taste is a nice, intially sweet malt base that get overtaken quickly by the hops. Resiny, piney hops flavor. Finish is dry, piney. Nice mouthfeel. Ths hops changed for this batch. They used Styrian Goldings along with another that I neglected to write down.
Free State Prairie Pale Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;IPA;Free State Brewing Company;Good. Drink this when they don't have barleywine at the pub. Had this on tap. Strong hop character, both boiling and finishing, but not an over hopped beer. Good balance. Pleasing malt body.
Free State Prairie Pale Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;IPA;Free State Brewing Company;Fruity, citrusy, hoppy aroma, with some light malt sweetness. Medium-dark golden color, hazy, with a lasting, creamy off-white head and plenty of lace. Flavor has some biscuity Pale malt flavor and a small amount of caramel sweetness, but overall the citrusy spicy, juicy hop flavors are most prominent, and features some pineapple and herbal tones underneath. Medium bodied, lightly creamy palate. Aftertaste also very hop-accented and satisfyingly bitter. Fresh and tasty.
Free State Prairie Pale Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;IPA;Free State Brewing Company;I could taste the hops the way they smell right out of the package...aroma was conspicuously absent though. Initial bite strong but quickly and sadly diminished.
Free State Prairie Pale Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;IPA;Free State Brewing Company;"This beer seems unfinished somehow, and is not nearly as good as Free State''s Copperhead Pale Ale (also an IPA). Bitter and malty enough for the supposed style (English IPA), but the hop aromas and flavors are prominently absent; the bitterness is the only aspect that really shines through. Not bad, but I''ve had much more complex IPA''s, from Free State alone."
Free State Wakarusa Lager;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Free State Brewing Company;On tap at Free State. Pours a copper color with white head. Clean, grainy, earthy, cereal aromas. Slightly bitter, grainy, earthy, slightly tangy flavors. Not bad lager.

Free State Wakarusa Lager;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Free State Brewing Company;Shakers at the brewpub. Pours a clear pale copper with a small beige head. Clean, somewhat biscuity malt with a solidly balancing earthy/citrusy hop note. On medium side of light-bodied with a nice soft mouthfeel and a tight bitter finish. Biscuity malt dances with a significant earthy, grassy, and slightly critic hop note and finishing bitterness. This is a really nice beer. Free State makes some of my favorite lagers ever.
Free State Wakarusa Lager;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Free State Brewing Company;"Shaker @ the brewpub. The beer is a copper color with a strong sticky head. The head has good retention and rings are formed as I gulp the beer down, akin to the age rings on a tree stump. Aroma has a great bitter, herbal hop aroma. I love it. Its a clean lager with bitter herbal hops; awesome. The slight difference here is a bit of sweetness, just a bit coming off the malt. Flavor has a great bitter herbal hop flavor as well mixed with that light sweetness. Otherwise it is all clean, nothing else coming off the malt. Bottom line: Just a simple, clean beer with an herbal hop center and a light malt sweetness."
Free State Wakarusa Lager;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Free State Brewing Company;On tap at Free State. Pours a crystal clear, golden-copper colored body with a finger-width, off-white, creamy head that dissipates quickly and leaves lots of lacing. Aroma is malty sweet with a light citrus hopping. Smooth caramels, lemon, earth, straw, and a faint spicing I can’t seem to put my finger on. Flavor has a much more pronounced hop character than the aroma. Sweeter caramels up front before an earthy, straw-like lemony hoppiness comes in. The hops grow into the finish where this dries with a moderate bitterness and a clean, caramel sweetness. Lengthy aftertaste of earthy lemons after a smooth, medium, very clean body. Overall, a solid beer. Fairly simple, but balanced with a good amount of hops and a sweeter, smooth malt body. Very clean and easy drinking.
Free State Wakarusa Lager;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Free State Brewing Company;10 oz draft pour at the brewpub. Pour is a clear golden amber with a smallish white head that falls with glass coating lacing. Aroma of not too much, some straw some hay, maybe a touch of earthiness behind that. Taste is mild sweet malt followed quickly by really drying straw mineral hops. Palate has light to medium body with lighter carbonation and the aforementioned dry finish. This was clean and easy to drink, nice, well made, straight forward beer.
Free State Wakarusa Lager;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Free State Brewing Company;Fruity, hoppy aroma, some citrusy orange and caramel malt sweetness with lighter notes of of mint, spicy hop and apple skin. Medium-dark copper color, clear, with a slight, subsiding head. Fruity and sweet up front, becoming hoppier as the flavor progresses and with lightly spicy, lemony finish. Moderate amount of bitterness throughout. Medium bodied, palate is quite lively. A lager that drinks like an IPA.
Free State Wakarusa Lager;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Free State Brewing Company;"Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit. The aroma and flavor practically hollared this to me. Beautiful deep amber shade, little head. It was ""super clean"", a little much for me though. The palate belied a slightly wheaty and complex malt character. But this was only after the grapefruit orgy faded to silence."
Free State Wheat State Golden;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Free State Brewing Company;"Bottle poured into a shaker on 7/3/18. Labeled only as ""Golden"". Gold color and a massive, thick, off white head. Aroma is wheat and citrus. Initial taste is rather bland... a little wheat and lemon. Aftertaste is much the same... very bready.

Golden shade and pure white suds. A clean, malty nose. Bread flavors with a hint of citrusy hops. Light-bodied and lively carbonation that’s just south of prickly. A nice brew for hot weather.
Free State Wheat State Golden;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Free State Brewing Company;Nothing special here. The dryness stands out. Having this in the cold of winter, seems better suited to have outside on a hot summer night. Rating would be higher if the timing was right.
Free State Wheat State Golden;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Free State Brewing Company;Golden beer with a foamy white head. Crisp cracker nose with hints of lemon.

Pours a glowing rich orange amber hue, transparent hue is fiery sun and amber sap glow. Frothy whitish head atop stays as a decent layer, mellow lacing from the ringer atop. Aromas are a bit of flaked wheat, some dust and dry straw meeting a mellow earthy hop. A faint underlying fruitiness hits the nose. Touches of earth,,dryness and spice, grainy flaked wheat and cereal elements. Initial is lighter end of the fold in body but not without some substance to it. Gentle bready malts, a flinty kick of estery fruit shows some life with some decent hop bitterness, grainy malts, earthy hops and gentle straw. Backend is a touch fruity, gentle flashes of lemon with some earthiness, florals and a bit of spice. Smoothed out backend with a touch of dryness, earth, lingering bread and that subtle kick of lemon juice making it a bit refreshing. Lighter, pretty crushable with a coolness to it on the palate. Nice.

Bluegrass Kolsch;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Bluegrass Brewing Company;"On tap. I can only assume the ratings of this beer are coming from bad or old bottles/kegs, or from people who can;t appreciate the subtleties of this style. This was one of the better Kolsches I have ever had, and usually I am pretty skeptical and judgmental of BBC. It pour a very nice copper color. Crystal clear, nice white head and lace. It exhibited a very nice hop profile on the nose and flavor. The hops are most certainly there, but carried out with a nice subtlety, making them very on point with the style. Medium to light bodied with minimal carbonation. Nice and smooth. Overall: I could session on this beer all day."

Nice aromas of floral hops, citrus and resin with some malt in there as well. Fairly well-balanced between caramel malt and bitter hops on the palate. Biscuity malt flavors appear is it comes to room temperature. Nice bitter finish.
Bluegrass American Pale Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;12oz bottle. It took more than 20 minutes, one foam-over, and four different attempts to pour this beer. The head never diminished, it just got chewed. Aroma is all hop resin and just enough malt sweetness to pull it together. The flavor is cloying hop resin. Absolutely no balance. Nothing I would drink again.

Bluegrass Oatmeal Stout;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Stout;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Cask at the brewpub. Pours dark opaque reddish brown with large red-brown head. The aroma is bourbon, oak, vanilla, and soy sauce. The flavor is quite oaken, with a touch of bitter coffee, just a brief note of soy sauce, and an ashy finish. Some smoke comes out increasingly in the aftertaste. Satisfying.

Nose is pure holiday spices, with lots of nutmeg upfront, and a little cinnamon. Flavour is the same, with lots of nutmeg and cinnamon, maybe a bit of clove too. Not very thrilling, but it’s done well for what it is.

Bluegrass Summer Wheat;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Wheat Ale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Pours clear golden with a thin eggshell head. Crisp aroma is more malty than wheaty.

Bluegrass Summer Wheat;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Wheat Ale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Tap @ Bluegrass: Pale straw color, cloudy & topped with a soapy, bright white collar. Bubbly. Grainy & wheat filled aroma with some cereal grains & faint pale malt sweetness. A little bit of hop leafiness in the flavor with more heaps of wheat & cereal grain. Slight flavor of buttered crackers in the finish. Very mild, light, & kind of vapid. Easy drinking but a little boring.
Bluegrass Summer Wheat;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Wheat Ale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;10oz pour just to see what it was about. poured clear bright yellow with white head. minimal lacing on the glass...found it disturbing that I couldn’t get any type of nose on this one...nothing. flavor was mild to medium malt and wheat and there was almost a mid bitterness from the wheat. not much here to tell you the truth. not bad but not anything to write home about.
Stone Coast Sunsplash Golden Ale;Bethel, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Reviewed from old notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a decent golden color with a film of thin white head. The smell had an ample amount of sweet corn lightly dosed with a slight caramel edge. The taste was pretty much the same adding a light biscuit-esque glaze over my taste buds. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a decent sessionability about it. The carbonation seemed ok for the style and for me. There’s a nice carbonation about it. Overall, this was a decent golden/blonde ale I could do again.
Stone Coast Sunsplash Golden Ale;Bethel, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Pours gold with a white head. Smells of some fruit, floral hops, dry pilsner malt. Tastes of toasted malt, some crisp hoppy notes and a floral finish.
Stone Coast Sunsplash Golden Ale;Bethel, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;20061007 After Kennett. Clear and pale gold. Big white head. Aroma it tinny and bretty, mineral, touch of bandaid. Flavor is mostly bland, mucho dry, seemingly infected. Late metallic notes and funk. Very thin and dry. Something I oddly enjoy with the flavor.
Stone Coast Sunsplash Golden Ale;Bethel, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Can sampled. Pours a golden yellow with a off-white head. Aroma of lemon, grass, and some grain. Flavor follows the aroma and is malty with a hint of citrus.
Stone Coast Sunsplash Golden Ale;Bethel, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;12 oz Can - Poured a somewhat cloudy golden yellow in color with a big foamy white head that faded fairly quickly. Aroma was somewhat malty and skunked (from a can?). Flavor was not as malty as I anticipated and there was more hops than I expected too. Finish was mildly bitter and short... finished cleanly. Not real good...
Stone Coast Sunsplash Golden Ale;Bethel, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;poured into tulip. pours a clear gold, with mild white head. a fresh golden malty aroma, not too much hidden. smooth and clean golden ale, light finish. not complex but serves its purpose, a good light sessionable quality.

Stone Coast Sunsplash Golden Ale;Bethel, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;"12 ounce can from the Beverage Warehouse in Winooski, VT (July 2007) served at cellar temperature in a Samuel Smiths pint glass. Huge, creamy-foamy white head erupts from the can, slowly decaying about the very bright, lightly hazy golden body and leaving thin spidery lacing....honey-biscuity aroma, light floral-perfumy hops, a touch of jasmine and lavender and then on a second nosing, beautiful ripe apricots.....not nearly as entrancing upon tasting, however: very thin and watery, with pale malts barely distinguishable in the bitter, slightly burnt and somewhat chemical-adjuncty flavor profile; at the finish a fuesel plasticy quality dominates and the experience is basically ruined....light to moderate carbonation, some mineralic and metallic notes also evident at the finish. This brewery has been frustrating to me, a couple of very high quality beers and everything else quite mixed....this one I’ll try again based mostly on Clark’s rave, but for now it’s not worth it."
Stone Coast Sunsplash Golden Ale;Bethel, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Light and fruity. Citrus, but not in a hoppy way. Reminds me a lot of the rind of a citrus fruit. A little bubble gum. Actually more bitter than I would have expected. Has some sort of harsheness that I can’t place. Really a strange beer that I can’t make up my mind on. It’s light and refreshing, but somehow that harshness prevents it from being an easy drinker.
Stone Coast Sunsplash Golden Ale;Bethel, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;On tap at David Copperfield’s in NYC. A minimum head on yellow body. Lace and creaminess, drinkable but a high carbonation. No aroma to speak of. Drop of cirus taste, more malt than hop.
Stone Coast 420 IPA;Bethel, Maine, United States;IPA;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Fairly thin head with staying power, spotty lace. Light amber/dark golden in color, barely perceiptable haze in the liquid. Dark earthy hops is the predominant aroma, no real floral touch. Slightly yeasty, malt is present with a caramel sweetness. Overly hoppy even for an IPA--not that I’m complaining, my tastes lean this way. Very astringent aftertaste, really bitter, long lasting. Malt flavors are brief and fleeting. Full bodied with good carbonation. This would be a great beer to try last in a flight of IPA’s. Too bitter for regular consumption.
Stone Coast 420 IPA;Bethel, Maine, United States;IPA;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Reviewed from old notes. This was poured into a pint glass at the brewpub. The appearance was a fairly nice looking glossy/hazy and somewhat golden to amber-ed orange color. There was a light foamy stringy lacing sticking and then sliding into the beer. The smell had a super nice aromatic citric/slightly piney aromas. The taste was there. It took the citrus with the pine to make a fairly nice bittersweet combination to taste. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat there but honestly, nothing overbearing and nothing far out. Overall, I say this was a good IPA I could bang again.
Stone Coast 420 IPA;Bethel, Maine, United States;IPA;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Poured into a snifter. 420 IPA pours a hazy, yellowish orange with a hint of red to it. Atop the brew is a nice off white head, with decent retention which leads to some light lacing. The aroma is a strong, sweet floral smell, with some hints of citrus, as well as some sweet grains. The beer tastes like tea with wet hops. Tastes dry-hopped eventhough the bottle didn’t say anything. The taste is a little light on the flavor compared to the aroma. Mouthfeel is smooth, yet a little dry. Mild to high on the carbonation level. At 6.9% some may not call this a session beer, but I beg to differ. It is smooth and has a different flavor than most IPAs, which makes the drinker take their time a little more, but not like a big beer.
Stone Coast 420 IPA;Bethel, Maine, United States;IPA;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;2006: Orange-gold appearance. Nice full amount of head that isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Cloudy and opaque. Overwhelming fruity scent. Overpowers any malt or hops that might be present. It’s a good smell, but doesn’t seem like it’s going to be an IPA. By smell alone, it seems like it would be an Apricot ale or some such madness. Malts and fruits dominate the bouquet. Has a very fruity, hoppy flavor. Unusual. Not quite anything I can remember having before. The fruit is actually much more prominent than the hops. I was expecting a bit more of a cannabis flavor given the name, but alas it is nowhere to be found. Tastes more like an apricot ale than an IPA. Or rather, an apricot ale with a heavy hop presence. A bit too fizzy and carbonated for my taste. I would prefer something a little smoother. The fizziness on the tongue makes it a bit of a tough sell. Harder to drink than many of the smoother IPAs. In fact, I would say that this beer is smooth as sandpaper. Not bad, just not one I crave.
Stone Coast 420 IPA;Bethel, Maine, United States;IPA;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Pours gold with a nice white head. Smells of grass, hay, floral. Tastes perfumy and bitter with a caramelly finish.
Stone Coast 420 IPA;Bethel, Maine, United States;IPA;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;"Nice hazy golden orange coloured body with a light amber tint and a frothy off-white head. Aroma of fresh hops, sweet sugars, oranges, grasses and green apples. Medium-bodied; Strong grassy hops with some floral hop quality and a plentiful potency of malt and caramel. Aftertaste shows more malt than hops and not a lot of hops at all. Overall, I thought this one would be more hoppy and well-rounded, but this one tasted like an APA. I sampled this 350 mL bottle purchased fresh from Oliver’s Beverage in Albany, New York on 08-October-2006."
Stone Coast 420 IPA;Bethel, Maine, United States;IPA;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;A very hazy appearance to it with a bit of fluffy white head. Lacing is minimal but present. The smell is of earthy hops and fruit. The most present taste is grapefruit with a bit of an additional bite form the hops. This is a pretty hefty IPA on the tongue with a grainy kind of texture. This is a highly drinkable brew. I probably couldn’t have too many due to its fuller body, but I’m good for a few. I’m usually more of a stout person but I enjoyed this brew and it was very different from other IPAs that I’ve had. I may become a hophead yet. Reviewed on: 05-23-2007
Stone Coast 420 IPA;Bethel, Maine, United States;IPA;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Pours a murky rust orange with a sturdy, dense off-white head. Much of the hop aroma is muted, with light citrus, fruits and nothing else. The flavour is has a nice orange citrus flavor with peppery citrus and honey sweetness. This is a very straight forward, toasty and easy drinking IPA, but nothing worth buying again in my opinion. The aftertaste is bitter in a non-medicinal way, which is nice. The mouthfeel is medium-thin, sticky and mildly carbonated.
Stone Coast 420 IPA;Bethel, Maine, United States;IPA;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;12oz. Bottle: Bottle exploded upon opening coating me half the beer. Lightly sweet aroma. Smells of fruity hops, peach, tangerine, apricot, pale malts, and slight citrus. Poured amber in color with a small, creamy, dense, off-white head that lasted throughout. Cloudy. Sparkling. Full of tiny and small particles. Very good lacing. Flavor is lightly sweet and medium bitter. Tastes of hops, fruit, grapefruit, resin, berries, and some other fruit I cannot identify. Medium body. Smooth, then chalky texture. Average to lively carbonation. Bitter, hoppy, resinous finish is medium dry.
Stone Coast 420 IPA;Bethel, Maine, United States;IPA;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;I was lucky enough to get one of the last kegs of this and had it on draft at my house. The head was massive and i had to wait a while for it to settle untill i could even drink it. The color is a bit cloudy with a redish amber color. The nose is full of light fruits and pepper spice. The flavor is nice and bitter leaving a tingle in your mouth after eash sip. There is some nice traces of caramilized malt with some toasted malt but overall it was a refreshing beer and it is a shame they will not be produceing it any more.
Sunday River Alt;Bethel, Maine, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Quart can via PUB'R. Pours hazy dark brown with fluffy head. Nose was corn flakey malt, earthy caramel. Tastes earthy, caramel malty, nutty, with a smooth finish and medium body.

Sunday River Black Bear Porter;Bethel, Maine, United States;Porter;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Drunk straight from a quart can, now thats something you don’t get to say very often, while floating on a Maine pond so I may be projecting a little bias onto this beer but wow this is a good one, coffee but not overly so, tasty rich malty
Sunday River Black Bear Porter;Bethel, Maine, United States;Porter;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Good flavor in a big (32oz.) can. Requisite dark coffee notes. Reliable roasting and a bit of bitterness makes for a fun drink.
Sunday River Black Bear Porter;Bethel, Maine, United States;Porter;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Reviewed from old notes. At the brewery, this was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a bar pour’s kind of slim white head. There wasn’t any lacing. The smell had a dark roasty coffee aroma with a robust quality to it. The taste was basically the same. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed somewhat subdued but mainly good for the style. I have to admit there does seem to be a fair amount wateriness about this. Overall, not a bad Porter, I’d have this again.
Sunday River Black Bear Porter;Bethel, Maine, United States;Porter;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Watery porter, whose smell is deceving, it has the right smell and smokey taste but the mouth feel leaves you disappointed
Sunday River Black Bear Porter;Bethel, Maine, United States;Porter;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Alpine Porter! Black Bear with the addition of juniper breweries. Aroma is a little funky - a bit like Lindburger cheese. Classic porter mouthfeel. Root beer coloring.
Sunday River Black Bear Porter;Bethel, Maine, United States;Porter;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Draft at Sunday River Brewing. Pours black with a thick head. This is a very good traditional porter. The roasted barley comes through and there is a nice dry hop finish. The beer is dry overall and easy to drink.
Sunday River Black Bear Porter;Bethel, Maine, United States;Porter;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Pitch black darkness. There are specks of yeast-sediment floating in the stagnant, tar-like body. Absolutely a black hole. Malty but with a surprising hop flourish. Fresh, flowery scent. Mild coffee flavor, but has an underlying sweetness. Has a nice hop kick that offers an excellent balance. Great balance of sweetness and hops. Nice thick flavor and fee. Has a nice, smooth feel afterward. A bit chalky but in a good way. Excellent, balanced porter. Has a nice, strong flavor,, but not overwhelming. A good combination of different flavors.
Sunday River Black Bear Porter;Bethel, Maine, United States;Porter;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Pours dark brown with a thin tan head. Smells of sweet malt and mildly roasty. Tastes of roasted malt and chocolatey, but a bit thin on the mouthfeel.
Yellow Rose Wildcatters Crude Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;This is to beer as oil is to beer. This is horrific crap, with hints of cauliflower and rotten roasted malt. Water, water, everywhere in this beer, and not a drop fit to drink.
Yellow Rose Wildcatters Crude Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Joe made me do it. I swear! I didn’t want to buy it, honest. Actually had this before and thought it was okay, but as I have no respect for the allowance of outdated bottles filling space that could be used for better product and the fact that unsuspecting souls may easily be lead to believe that this isn’t as rancid as it is, I will not mince words. Lactic, acidic - but not in a pleasant way nor is the oxidized matter that I almost made myself finish before I said the punishment was enough. Sad.
Yellow Rose Wildcatters Crude Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;"Still available...bottom of the coolers at S & K’s in Plano, among other places. And you know, I’ve had worse. This was especially palatable when it was relatively cold from the fridge. It poured a dark ruby-black with a bountiful dark beige head. The aroma, when cold, let out coffee, roasted essences with notes of grape, vinyl, and licorice. The flavor was similarly roasted and relatively pleasing--at first--although the palate is quite light. It is to stouts what something with Woodforde’s Norfolk Nip is to barleywines: you’re expecting thick, but you get an explosion in the mouth. That’s not bad, actually: not every stout has to be thick and oily, although with a name like ""Crude Stout"" I was expecting something more akin to a viscous fluid. Unfortunately, as it warmed, I started to get more sour notes from it, not exactly lactic, more just subtly vinegary, and then it got too much. So, I would say, keep it cold and drink it fast. But even with these problems, if you haven’t had it and you see it around, I would spring for it--at $2.50 for an unfiltered, unpasteurized beer, if it has been well kept it has the potential for having evolved a bit, and it isn’t terrible."
Yellow Rose Wildcatters Crude Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Not too bad, but not one of my favorites. The dark color is reminiscent of an oatmeal stout , but the flavor lacks the sweetness. It has hints of coffee and roasted chocolates in both the aroma and the taste. I’d give it a B+.
Yellow Rose Wildcatters Crude Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;"Had this from a pint bottle. This black beer came flowing out of the bottle with a ton of carbonation. Aroma was roasted and chocolatey; very pleasureable. The flavor had lots of deep rostedness and chocolate but the zing from the carbonation really detracted from the flavor. Some acidity in the aftertaste."
Yellow Rose Wildcatters Crude Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Appearance: deepest, darkest black, with significant speckles floating throughout, and a sturdy brown head above, similarly dotted, and heroically long-lived. Aroma: briskly bitter, distinctly espresso-ish, rich and roasted, velvety, divine. Taste: smooth deliverance on the tongue, and full of flavor, very sweet, chocolatey, caramelly... A bit lighter in body than I like my stouts, but otherwise, an excellent example. I enjoyed this all the way down the big, bad bottle!
Yellow Rose Wildcatters Crude Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Poured opaque black with a thin tan head and BIG floaties...by big I mean physically they were big....not a lot of little ones like some bottle conditioned Belgians, LARGE 1/16-1/8 of an inch stuff...some you could feel actually pass your lips...I am honestly not sure the age of this bottle...I know it is brewed by Great Grains now, but my bottle still says Yellow Rose and the phone number on the bottle was answered by a slightly irritated lady when I called to just see what would happen (since YR closed [also it was 1 AM, I guess I’m just rude])... Smell is roasty with some chocolate...taste is rather bland...there isn’t a whole lot going on at all...just roasted maltiness, some nuts, chocolate and coffee...finish is acidic and a little bitter...
Yellow Rose Wildcatters Crude Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;dark almost black color with a fluffy tan head with yeasties or some other specks floating in it. roast chocolate aroma. taste is oil and low grade chocolate malts. doesn’t start well, and ends the same way/ best great grains product yet, but that is not saying much. this does not compare well with other stouts and finishes bitter and watery
Yellow Rose Wildcatters Crude Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Bottle. Oily pour with LOTS of yeasty floaties. Do you remember what it looked like out the window of the Milinieum Falcon when they went into light speed? That is what my glass looks like. Too many floaties. Slightly sour nose. Taste like a really good stout with paint thinner mixed in. The best Great Grains beer, but what is that worth?
Yellow Rose Wildcatters Crude Stout;Dallas, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;"On looks alone this brew should be a winner. When poured out of the bottle it errupted with a hugh head. But then I had to sip it and as they say in Texas ""all hat and no cattle""."

Portland Brewing WheatBerry Brew;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Golden Color, berry aroma (Marion berry and other berry flavors). Slight berry taste, more bitter than sweet. A wheat beer flavored with berries but still has maltyness to it.
Portland Brewing WheatBerry Brew;Portland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Very strong fruity flavors, but not very sweet, which is a plus. On the other hand, I don't think I like marionberry. It tastes, well, funny. It's not a bad idea for a beer, just not my cup of tea (or, mug of beer, as the case may be). Looks and smells good, though, and easy drinking.

HardCore Black Cider;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Apple Cider;HardCore Cider (Boston Beer Company);"Pours a deep ruby/mahogany with a slight fizz, but no head whatsoever. Apple aroma with light vinegar notes. Flavor is crisp apple tartness with a kiss of cherry and a drop of honey. No ""wooden"" notes... the only evidence of barrel-aging is in its smoothness - it holds light astringence, but its sourness isn’t upsetting. Found in my sister’s fridge."
HardCore Black Cider;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Apple Cider;HardCore Cider (Boston Beer Company);Golden in color with a small white head that quickly disapates. Aroma of applesw, slightl sweet finishes dry.
HardCore Black Cider;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Apple Cider;HardCore Cider (Boston Beer Company);Why is this brew rated so low it great stuff.Nice amber color,nearly no head,strong apple aroma.Sweet/sour apple taste that is quite pleasant but i fear will lead to some hard core after effects as many of my fellow raters have posted.Over all i don't think this brew is rated very well i think it deserves a higher place.Hard to say what is the best cider since i'm not an aficciando(spelling problem) but i know what i like and this is a pretty decent cider and worth a decent rate.
HardCore Black Cider;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Apple Cider;HardCore Cider (Boston Beer Company);as ciders go this is definitly one of the more palatable ones. Not too sweet for once!
HardCore Black Cider;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Apple Cider;HardCore Cider (Boston Beer Company);Yikes! This stuff ranks right up there with Mad Dog 20/20. Just like drink cheap apple wine. Whew, I cannot describe the head ache pain I had the next morning after drinking this one night. Stay away from the Hard Core.
HardCore Black Cider;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Apple Cider;HardCore Cider (Boston Beer Company);Re-rate 6/4/02: No, I wasn't foolish enough to drink this again, but I was reading through my ratings when I saw this and cringed. I was dismayed to see that I gave this a 0.8. This is on a short list of things that I will never drink again, unless I'm stuck on a desert island for life or in Hell. First rating: Holy shit! I'll be lucky if I'm alive in the morning, never-mind finishing this. Sweet and sour in a really bad way. No head. The dark color is the ONLY thing going for this.

Fischer Bitter;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Heineken (France);500mL swingtop bottle poured pale golden color with big white head settling quickly to some fine lacing. Aromas of hops and more hops. Taste is predominantly hoppy bitterness with a light malty sweetness in the background. Decently balanced for a bitter and has nice carbonation and mouthfeel.
Fischer Bitter;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Heineken (France);Beer no longer available for Fischer products, was sell in France in the typical Fischer bottle but with a green color. The smell was intense on hops and grass. Aroma was very bitter at the beginning followed by a very perfumed aftertaste. One of those beer we really miss.
Fischer Bitter;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Heineken (France);16.6 oz swingtop bottle 9/01-Pours a medium golden with a decent white head. Aroma of caramel and fruits. Taste of dryness, sweetness, and bitterness. This light to medium bodied brew was different but OK to drink.
Fischer Bitter;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Heineken (France);This one was kinda too much at first, had a rough front and sorta dry and middle, and definatly hopppie at the close, no exactly my bag, but good for the fans and those who like british type of beers~
Fischer Bitter;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Heineken (France);650 ml green swingtop. Pours a slightly hazy, orange-gold with a four-finger, creamy sticky head. Nice aroma of caramel, fruit, honey, and slight grass. Flavor is amazingly balanced between sweet and dry, having a big dry cereal flavor that is dried by some grassy-herb hops into a mildly sweet and tart caramel apple taste. Light-medium body is refreshing and dry. Nice caramel aftertaste. Seems more like a British style bitter ale than a pilsener, but gets high marks nonetheless.
Fischer Bitter;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Heineken (France);A very average beer. I was disappointed considering the cost. This is a transfer from an old account.
Fischer Bitter;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Heineken (France);"Pours a slightly hazy deep gold with some off white head. Nose is heavy towards apple. Flavor is quite smooth with, yes, a bitter tone in the background, though not predominately so. At the start you get what seems like a bit of a sweetness. Feel is slightly watery with a slight carbonation to it. Very drinkable, though for some that ""bitter"" might detract. For it being this style, I am impressed. Worth a shot."

Beer Works Beantown Nut Brown Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Beer Works;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a dark brown color with a finger’s worth of eggshell white foamy head that fell off at a moderate pace. Light messy lace. The aroma had some strong notes of roast, chestnut/pecan, toast, cocoa powder, light coffee grinds and ends with a little bit of earthy hops. The flavor lent a hand to the sweetness initially and then mildly brings in the roast slightly. Some of which blended into the aftertaste and rubs the finish in the same sort of way. The feel was about medium bodied, perhaps just a tad under. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt good too. Overall, good brown ale worthy of having again.
Beer Works Beantown Nut Brown Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Beer Works;Draft. A dark brown beer with an off-white head. The aroma has notes of roasted malt, caramel, and bread.

Beer Works Beantown Nut Brown Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Beer Works;Pours a nearly opaque dark chocolate brown with a fairly thick tan head. Aroma has a malty core with notes of caramel and cloves and a snippet of cinnamon added to it. Roast malt flavor trots cinnamon, caramel, clove and even slight molasses notes across the palate. Lively, fizzy texture is fairly firm, and leaves a tingly feeling on the palate and on the pipes as it heads downstairs. Beans, beans, the musical fruit...

Beer Works Beantown Nut Brown Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Beer Works;12 oz draft pour for about $5. Brown with almost no head. Aromas of malt and beer. Fairly interesting flavor, it has a fruity bittersweetness I associate with really dark chocolates. Maybe a bit overboard on the dark malt however, tastes almost burnt. This is a totally inoffensive and OK brown ale, nothing to seek out but nothing to avoid. If you’re at Beer Works and want a brown ale go for it.

Woodchuck Granny Smith Draft Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);Tried this a couple years ago. Remember it being one of the better standard ciders that I had at the time, until recently I just tried the pear which seemed smoother. The green apple had that tart flavor whereas the pear was a little sweeter. Starting to get into ciders more, but this is something somebody else usually brings that I'll sample a single from. I would like to try them both again to compare, but I know there are better ones out there.

Woodchuck Granny Smith Draft Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);"Pours a very clear light lime color. Sort of like you took water and squeezed a lime into it. No head, no lacing. Aroma is light apple skin and tart. Taste is sweet tart. Perhaps a little too sweet. Tastes like Granny Smith apple skin. A little too watery. Mouthfeel is light. Tart. Sharp dryness, which may be the only thing that saves the cider. Overall, it’s not great. I guess it would beat NOT having a cider. But if I had to choose between this and another one; I would choose the other one."

Woodchuck Granny Smith Draft Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);12 oz. bottle. Thanks Thomas! Pours clear, pale green, with no head. Distinct tart apples, vanilla, cloves, and light lemon. Sweet and fruity up front, with a good tart bite in the finish. Light body, with a crisp and acidic mouthfeel. Not a bad cider.

Brew Moon Mayberry Wheat R.F.D.;Honolulu, Hawaii, United States;Wheat Ale;Brew Moon Restaurant & Microbrewery;Tap (listed as Moonberry Wheat). Raspberry wheat malt aroma. Pale yellow color with small head. Light raspberry wheat malt flavor. Nice frutiy flavor but very light.
Brew Moon Mayberry Wheat R.F.D.;Honolulu, Hawaii, United States;Wheat Ale;Brew Moon Restaurant & Microbrewery;On tap. Bad sign when even my girlfriend claims it is just too “weak” in flavor. Pours a cloudy light yellow with a cream-white head. Served with a lemon in a pint glass that is chilled in the fridge. Nice touch, but how much pizzazz do they need to throw in to mask a mediocre beer? Flavor is primarily wheat notes, light spice, and then a raspberry-sweet flavor. Not entirely bad, but where this beer really loses points is the finish. It seems like before the beer even goes down your throat, it has lost ALL of its earlier flavor and replaced it with strangely astringent cut-grass. Seems a bit gimmicky.
Brew Moon Mayberry Wheat R.F.D.;Honolulu, Hawaii, United States;Wheat Ale;Brew Moon Restaurant & Microbrewery;Taster - Brew Moon Brewery - Honolulu, Hawaii 2008 - Hawaiian Beer Run Aroma – Light ale aroma with the smattering of berry aroma also. Appearance – Golden yellow color, hazy with a nice head. Flavor – This had a good wheat flavor with the smallest amount of fruit that I could possibly taste. It was light but over all ot a bad beer. Palate – Nice wheat Mouthfeel with a nice easy dry finish. Overall – A very nice wheat beer this could use a tad more fruit. The bee would sell like hotcakes if the fruit was really more present. The ladies would go nuts.

Brew Moon Mayberry Wheat R.F.D.;Honolulu, Hawaii, United States;Wheat Ale;Brew Moon Restaurant & Microbrewery;I don’t know if this is the Moonberry (raspberry) Wheat, but that’s what I had.

Woodpecker Cider;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);"275 ml bottle at abv 3.5% bought at 517 Food Place in Tsuen Wan. Clear light golden colour with orange hue; Near zero head with residual soapy white foam which fades in 5 seconds; Poor sticky lacing with near zero carbonation; Quite fragrant aroma of light apple wine, with yoghurt, light mustiness, apple juice and sugar; Close to medium sweet taste of light apple juice, with alcohol, fair yoghurt, soda, sugar, and light tannin; Light body. Watery palate; Mouth feel is watered-down apple juice with pretty naked light booze, some apples, yoghurt and mustiness. White washed, very soda-ish with fair sweetness. Light tannin finish. Bad!... Slightly dry after taste. Very easy to mouth. Comments: Another macro cider nightmare, probably being cut from some the same cloth with Babycham - over-diluted fruit juice, too soda-ish, naked light booze - in this case there's at least a hint of apple juice and yoghurty characters, but not enough to write home about. I rather have apple juice than this!"
Woodpecker Cider;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Bulmers Cider (Heineken UK);Looks a lot like Lucozade in a glass.

Tried on draught many years ago.
