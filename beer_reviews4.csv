Ales of Kent Defiance!;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ales of Kent Brewery;Defiance! is the most recent offering from one of Kent's most recent microbreweries. An extremely pleasant, softly but interestingly hopped pale ale with a good fruity body. A very satisfying and refreshing drink, full of flavour, but gentle and well rounded. The bottle has a Latin motto: 'Scienta giducia plena provocone' which roughly translates as - The wise have the confidence to challenge! Footnote: The brewery has now closed.
Four Alls Smugglers Glory;Richmond, Durham, England;Porter;Four Alls;Cask conditioned - no sparkler. Black beer with an off white head (I would have thought this a porter rather than Brown Ale!).

Badger IPA;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Old notes from way back when. Before 2003 certainly. Don’t usually enter pre-RateBeer notes but, since this is retired and I won’t get it again, what the heck. Cask (handpump), tight sparkler. A soft, thin, amber-coloured session bitter of little distinction. Too bland to find glaring faults. Probably dumped in favour of the similar strength King & Barnes Bitter so that Badger could say they hadn’t axed K & B beers altogether. No great loss.
Badger IPA;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask Handpump at the Pig & Porcupine, Manchester 31/08/2002 Amber golden coloured slightly pale and fruity. Acidic taste. Hop finish.
Badger IPA;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);This beer doesn't seem to react well to bad handling, I have had very good pints, but also very poor ones. The rating is for the better pints, but only give it a try if you trust the Landlord.
Badger IPA;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);"Hoppy aroma, bit fruity. The beer looks like applejuice. No head. And it's not just the looks; I was amazed I actually tasted apples in the beer, furthermore hoppy and bitter taste. palate is moderate bitter. Not impressive."
Badger IPA;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Clear orange color, hardly any foam. Hoppy aroma. Light hoppy and bitter taste. Not a drain pour, but i would not order it again.
Badger IPA;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Original Rating 4th May 2002 - Had this on draught in a Badger pub. Very out of condition.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Mid brown, thin head and limited aroma. Traditional English bitter, without being bitter enough for my taste.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask @ St Stephen’s Tavern, Westminster London. As Badger Best. Golden with a thin head. Mildly sticky-sweet texture, not a ’best’ bitter, but drinkable.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Had this twice, first in Salisbury at The New Inn then later in Chipping Campden. Mild and a bit thin noticeable hops. Best thing was I got a glass.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);A bit watery and not packed with flavour, prefer the tanglefoot, but this is a standard brown bitter. Slightly boring.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask at St Stevens Tavern, Westminster. Copper coloured bitter, main character a slightly spicy fruitiness, medium finish. A good example of west country bitter i guess, but have to say it isn’t my favourite part of the country for local beer.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Unassuming mid-brown ale in which neither malt nor hops dominate. Head retention is generally close to zero - not a problem if you like it that way. Just isn’t a beer I can get excited about.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);On cask. Another Badger beer and this one seems quite strange. What can I say the lack of sugar is rather noticeable I mean why have such a sour tasting beer as this. At 4% abv your not gonna get drunk on it that easy but its far from exciting this ale to be honest i’d rather drink some lemonade.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask conditioned at the Ship & Shovell, Charing Cross. Amber coloured with next to no head. Aroma had a touch of caramel and a hint of grassy hops. Flavour was slightly sweet before a decent enough bitter finish. Ok, but not memorable.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask (Tasted in London) Amber clear colour with a little head. Light aroma of floral and caramel. Light flavour of caramel and flower notes, nothing special at all, very common cask.
Badger Dorset Best / Badger Best (Cask);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask, handpump @ the conveniently named King’s Arms Inn, Mickleton. Bright and still in the glass and a tawny copper in colour. Head was there then it wasn’t, but I can’t say it was the gravity of the brew (unclean pint glass!?!). Burnt caramel and burnt toast aroma that was sharp and a little unpleasant. Rather dull in the mouth with a flat, filling but lifeless body in desperate need of flavour. Bitter, burnt caramel and toffee shines through with a flavour I can only best describe as burnt, soggy newspapers. Finish is tannic and claps out with nothing showing in the aftertaste. This was as boring as hell and any characteristics it showed just did not work. A wishy-washy bitter!!!
Badger Tanglefoot (Bottle/Can);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Aroma of fruits, malt and a hint of hay. Golden with a white head. Medium + sweet and medium bitter. Medium + body with average to soft carbonation. Slightly dry and bitter finish. Overall a decent Strong Bitter.
Badger Tanglefoot (Bottle/Can);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Yes, can. Unlike the cask that I tried 4 years ago which I remember extremely well. (Actually I have no idea). This pours with a bleach white foam and medium gold body, with nothing but rotting grain on the nose. The flavour is soft Hallowe'en candies, those chewy caramel types, and a fair bit of tin thrown in. Cloying sugariness. Wow, just.... I can't even, as the reddit incel moderators say. Just a pile of caramelly junk.
Badger Tanglefoot (Bottle/Can);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);0,5l bottle @ Vihreä Haltiatar. Pours clear golden with a medium head. Aroma is sweet malts. Flavor is sweet malts with some hops. Decent.
Badger Tanglefoot (Bottle/Can);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Bottle from Waitrose. #4 MJ 500 beer of this 2019 summer trip. Medium gold with a tall, fine head. Nose is lightly citrus hops, bit of bread, touch of cardboard and pear. Lightly spicy hops. Rather plain. Falvor is lemony, almost a touch of candy in there, tart from the hops. Some white bread and sweetness. interesting hops. Prickly, lightly bitter finish. Rather fizzy, lager-like. Ok but certainly not all that profound. This was probably one of the first wave of UK golden ales that went for the lager market, but it has been surpassed abundantly by this time. Not up there with Summer Lightning even, I would say. Still drinkable but would not be in anyone's 500 today.
Badger Tanglefoot (Bottle/Can);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Bottle 5% Pours great with a lovely head caramel taste in the background, But not as I remember it, no body and weak and watery No substance or hop taste either.
Badger Tanglefoot (Bottle/Can);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Can brewed in England. Aroma of pear and a little hops. Gold in colour. Large, moderately-lasting head with a fair few bubbles. Moderate-light carbonation, taste is earthy malt with some grassy hop lurking in the background. A touch metallic at the end, but then a lingering biscuity maltness. Something of an indoor, slightly later in the day beer.

Ballards Nyewood Gold;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ballards;500ml bottle. Felt slightly over carbonated on opening but then its bottle conditioned and a bit livelier than filtered ales. Yeast profile was the most discernable element. I brew my own full mash ales and this was remeniscent of ales I’ve brewed in the past. I’ve had this on tap before and its alot hoppier from the barrel. Doesnt really work from the bottle.

Ballards Wassail;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;Ballards;3rd beer on a ’random tasting evening’ with myself on 21st July 2017. 500ml bottle BBE July 2017, obtained from the English Heritage site at Roman Wroxeter (Shropshire). Poured slowly into a lovely vase shaped pint glass, badged for ’Old Speckled Hen’. Misty light brown pour, a dirty amber maybe: full and deep off-white blanket of foam on top. Shit, it’s been skunked, left in the sun on a shelf for too long: can’t drink it: bollox! I hate pouring beers down the sink, but this is undrinkable. Scored as I found it.

Aromas are bretty, this has clearly picked up a wild yeast somewhere along the line. Loads of sherbet, wood, funky yeast and forest floor. Unintentional, I’ll bet, but actually not bad. Taste is red fruit, wood, horse blanket. Dry finish. Better than expected, for a bottle that’s probably sat on the shelf in a warm gift shop for nearly a year.

Yards Old Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Yards Brewing Company;Sweet, roasty and vinous. The plummy dark fruit flavors blend with a little bit of toffee and maple and there are blackberries and acidity in there too. Ends witha dry (tobacco?) note and a hint of smoke/char. May be past its porime (’99 bottle) but still quite tasty.
Yards Old Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Yards Brewing Company;1999 Vintage (tasted on 1/5/05). Poured a dark reddish-brown with a huge (almost 5 finger) off white head. Aromas and tastes of dark fruits (raisins), chocolate, licorice and a little smoky. Some sour cherries lurking in the background and at the finish. Lightly sweet. Lively carbonated body with a nice dry finish. This one aged well and I’m glad I picked it up.
Yards Old Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Yards Brewing Company;(Vintage 1999) Huge light brown head of tiny bubbles. Settles very slowly. Great carbonation which keeps a thin foam on the surface. Rich aroma of raisins, chocolate covered cherries, tobacco and a dusty dryness. Color is a deep dark brown/red. Bit of sweetness and a good helping of raisins, dry smoky tobacco and a nice bitterness. Finish is dry and a little bitter. Very good old ale that has aged well. Little strange flavor in that it is very dry and dusty. Still quite good though.
Yards Old Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Yards Brewing Company;Pours with a huge, rocky head that refuses to settle down. It leaves an impressive lace, actually more of a sea foam impression than lace. The aroma is mostly malt sweetness with a hint of cherry. The taste is interesting. Very prominent malt flavors which remind me of a good bourbon's sweetness. Some fruitiness is also apparent, but it doesn't seem to be a single flavor. The alcohol is noticable, and the finish is a touch too bitter in that the bitterness seems to linger. And with all the sweetness, there is a slight sourness on the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little edgy, with strong carbonation attacking the tongue and gums. This may help offset the sweetness a touch.
Yards Old Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Yards Brewing Company;This is a strong beer with a sweet flavor. It can be cranky at times. It's at its best if you get it cask conditioned.

Poured a light orange or dark yellow with tiny body particles of average thickness and a very small, fizzy, off-white head that mostly diminished. The aroma was light citrus hops, light doughy yeast and vanilla. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and lightly acidic; while the finish was heavily acidic and very sour with an average duration. there was citrus, slight vanilla and a little funk then a ton of sour lime. the light to medium body was watery then dry with tingly carbonation and a moderate to heavy astringent finish."

A sophisticated accent .. poured out glowing burnt peach with a small’ish beige head . this feels more robust and potent than 8/5 %.. which is a inevitable at this age . It is pretty soulfull on the palate . Loads of rich malt , earthy muddy hops , bitter nutty roast , cherry covered caramel dimensions that become burnt .

Deep mahogany colour creamy tight head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt and fruity plums hint of spirit. Taste to follow classic sweet scotch beer style with fruity/bitter balance. Very Nice.

Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);From old tasting notes. Bright yellow gold color. Big creamy white head. Assertive sweet malt nose. Soft malty flavor has buttery notes. Light dry finish. Nice lacing as well.
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Aroma and flavor is caramel/malts, a bit of earthiness and a fruit/slightly hoppy finish.
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);"Bottle. Orangey Gold. Malty; biscuity malts, caramel. Fruity; light grapefruit-citrus. Hoppy; slight grassy hops. Sweet malty fruity. Quite dry. Drinkable. OK. (2008)"
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Bona cervesa, bastant equilibrada i gustosa. Buena cerveza, bastante equilibrada y sabrosa.
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Bottle. This is a decent golden ale but nothing worth seeking out. Straight forward simple brew.
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Light hazy yellow. Aroma of fruit and butterscotch. Taste is thin, a bit sweet, a bit sour, and some bitterness late in the aftertaste. Not much flavour.
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);I think that many of the previous reviewers may have had out of date bottles, hence odd aroma and taste. My bottle was fresh (@ Sergio’s World Beer Bar in Louisville) as it was recently obtained and brought over from the brewer. Pours a hazy dirty orange with a good bubbly white head, big streaks of lace. Yes, the taste is full caramel malt (as are many British session ales), and there is some candied fruit in a mildly hoppy finish, but I could find nothing wrong here. It is a good example of the style, and, as such, I recommend it.
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Claims to be the first ever organic beer brewed (back in the 1990’s). Good for Spock and other Vegans I suppose. This 500ml brown bottle had a best before date of 26 Sep 2008, I drank it a month later. Poured into a Batemans pint glass, it was a golden slightly hazey colour with a good sized white head which slowly faded to a collar and a wispy covering. The aroma was of flowers and cut grass, very floral indeed. The beer was spritzy more than fizzy, a twang of citrus fruits in the taste. Unlike most UK brewed beers I’ve had. Sadly there was something missing, where was the 5% alcohol, where was the bitterness I was expecting and like? Overall not too bad, it just lacked that bitterness I require in a UK pint.
Caledonian Golden Promise (Pasteurised);Edinburgh, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Bottle pours a murky dark gold with a tiny off white head. Scent is yeast and earth. Taste is same.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Tasted this in the Saltcot, Saltcoats (JDW) in January 2000. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear mahogany in colour with a thin creamy white head. Strong distinctive Caley aroma of soft toffee. Thin but creamy texture to the mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt complex gives a robust maltloaf base with sweet notes of velvet butterscotch, dates, maple syrup and rum soaked raisins. No strong hop presence noted in the short aftertaste as sweetness continues into the toffee laced malty finish. A cracking take on the old ale style and ticks all the right boxes for me. Excellent session ale to celebrate the national bard.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask Handpump at the Beer House, Manchester 25/01/2003 Golden coloured and slightly rich on the palate. Lasting malt hop finish.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Bottle Conditioned. Dingy brown with short head. I have been looking forward to this for a while, after all a Scottish (for now) Brewery producing a beer in the name of its favourite poet (some might say), it must be good. Well this is a real stinker, sweet and plummy are the best adjectives I can give it, other than that a total waste of time, no body, no interesting asides, a flabby raw ale as R.B would say.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask at The Anchor, Birmingham. No head, some lacing, pleasant caramel aroma. This was a nicely sweet brew, with big dollops of toffee and lemon. Very slight bitterness on the finish, but fairly restrained. A rather nice brew.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Handpump, Head of Steam, Euston, London. From previous comments, it seems this might be rather better from the cask than from the bottle. Mid brown colour. Malt dominates the aroma, as expected. Although it was smooth and slightly sweet in the mouth, in the Scottish style, there was also plenty of bite to balance that out and, if fact, it finished quite dry. Medium bodies, well balanced and easy drinking. A nice drop.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);This beer started life as bottle conditioned, then became pastuerised. The claim on my 2002 version is that it has become bottle conditioned again. This is a pleasant brew with a nice yeasty/brown bread after taste - but slightly spoiled by the straight ahead sugar sweetness.
Caledonian Robert Burns;Edinburgh, Scotland;Old Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Supposed to be bottle conditioned but was as clear as a bell and no sediment in bottle. Citrus hops on the nose followed by a hint of malt. Chewy body with hints of caramel and toffee backed up with a yeasty bite in the finish.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask at Sports Bar & Grill, Crossrail Place. It pours a clean amber color with a small off white head. Aroma is nutty and grassy with notes of bread and custard. Taste is also medium crispy bready with more notes of caramel, straw and grass. Light bodied with soft carbonation. Overall, quite nice
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Tasted this in the Last Post, Paisley (JDW) in March 2000. Cask, handpump dispense. An interesting mahogany brown in colour with a thick creamy off white head. Strong caley toffee really evident in the lingering aroma. Thick creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt complex gives thick chewy mouthfeel of maltloaf and sweet butterscotch. Slight citric taint of hop flowers but sweet toffee malt floods the finish with chewy biscuit flavours. An enjoyable session ale this but maybe too sweet for some.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);A ruby coloured ale, with a malty nose ,and a wattery smooth full sweet flavour with toffeish tones and bitter linger
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Pint off pump. Poured a thick reddy brown with a good and sustained off-white head. Aroma was faint, with hints of malt and fruitiness. A pleasant beer but not all that much flavour: a little hoppy with hints of malt and fruit. Sweet. Extremely smooth and goes down well. Not bad, but reminds me of a lot of ’rugby themed’ beers.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask at Charlies. Amber coloured. Fruity aroma. Fresh and fruity flavour with malty notes.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask at Charlie’s. Pale / amber appearnce. Flavour is sweet and slightly stickky. Some butter in the falvour adds character. Finish is bitter with hints of prunes?
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask conditioned @ Humble Plumb, Soton. Pale copper colour. Citrussy hops and sweet caramelised malts. Some fruitiness in the body but balanced by a smooth bitter finish.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask handpull at Thomas Ingoldsby, Canterbury. Golden with lasting off white head. Soft but minerally, some sulphur, like many Caley beers. Creamy, citrus finish with soft, creamy floral caramel aroma. Soft and eggy in mouth. Finish has some tingle to it.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask conditioned @ ’The Freshie’ Formby. Golden coloured beer. Quite sweet with some fruitiness. More malt than hops but finishes with a strong hint of bitterness.
Caledonian Six Nations;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Interesting flavor, it is like creamy and sour. But stills being bitter, I like this kind, makes me not dislike all ales.
Caledonian Murrayfield Grand Slam;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask Conditioned at The Lampett Arms, Tadmarton. Dark brown beer with bubbly head. Strange mixture of weak ingredients and sour grapes. Sold just as Murrayfield in England as their last grand slam was a while ago.
Caledonian Flying Scotsman (Retired);Edinburgh, Scotland;Mild Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask at the Goat and Tricycle, Bournemouth. Retired? Clearly not. A clear reddish brown pour with a white frothy head. A rather spicy aroma which leads to a very refreshing spicy malty taste. The spiciness sticks around for a while too. Quite an unusual ale and I'd love to know the hops they use! A really great beer suitable for any time of the year. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Caledonian Flying Scotsman (Retired);Edinburgh, Scotland;Mild Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);First tasted this ruby ale in the Bull Inn, Paisley in December 1996. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear ruby in colour with a thick white creamy head. Caley trademark of highland toffee in the lingering aroma. Creamy smooth mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt complex gives a moist maltloaf flavour with rum soaked raisin notes and toffee. Slight prickle of hop resins in the short aftertaste. Malt is dominant in the fruity finish with caramelised strawberry evident. An excellent Scottish ruby ale and sadly missed.

Caledonian Flying Scotsman (Retired);Edinburgh, Scotland;Mild Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask conditioned - handpump - JDW Northampton. A dark brown beer with a slight ruby hue. The aroma has some fruit, some mocha but also some typical Caledonian diacetyl. The taste is malty with caramel, coffee and more diacetyl. Could be really good but let down by signature notes.
Caledonian Flying Scotsman (Retired);Edinburgh, Scotland;Mild Ale;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Dark looking, heavy tasting and gorgeous. Hamilton Hall, Liverpool St., London. Tasty as hell. The type of thing I want on at any festival.
Caledonian 125;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);First tasted this ale in Coanes, Johnstone in September 1995. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear amber in colour with a thin white creamy head. Strong aroma of highland toffee, long in intensity. Creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a smooth creamy toffee flavour through the chewy digestive biscuit base. Slight dusty hop prickle evident but does not impact on the sweet malty finish. A cracking session ale and sadly missed.

Caledonian Golden Pale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);500ml bottle from Shropshire. Vintage 1997. Some carbonation, soon fading. Stale/vintage flavours and aroma- cardboard and stale bread and some mould. Few hops. Some soggy biscuit sweetness. Not a lot happening here.
Caledonian Golden Pale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);My wife and I really disagreed on this. She liked it quite well, but I wasn’t so sure (of course I’m writing the review, so I win). It had lots of flavor in it, but it also had a skunky, musty side to it. A fairly standard english style bitter, a little too carbonated.

Caledonian Golden Pale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Small head from a vigorour pour with large, fluffy,soapy bubbles on top. Grape and pear aroma with a bit of spices. Very interesting and good aroma. Some raisins in there also. Color is a medium orange/brown. Bitter, rusty, gritty flavor and mouthfeel. Not very plesant. Nice roasted character develops after the swallow. Thin body with some hops. Beer started off pretty damn good but fell flat on its face.
Caledonian Golden Pale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Hazy amber body topped by small beige head. Aroma is earthy, peach and light orange. Taste is earthy, medium sweet, light orange. Watery, undercarbonated medium body.
Caledonian Golden Pale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Bottled. Golden with a hint of orange. Nose is malty, some caramel notes, bit of zippy spice. Odd, odd, flavor. Definite maltiness, nutty quality I tend to associate with British ales. Has a very noticeable whiskey flavor, like a bottled boilermaker. While the abv is low, it actually seems to have a whiskey burn to it, very subtle, but definitely some odd harshness going on. Also quite yeasty in the finish, perhaps some kind of brewing problem here? Really enjoyed the creaminess of it, but too many odd things going on flavor-wise to really like this one.
Caledonian Golden Pale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask: Reminds me much of their IPA with its citrussy palate. A touch of spice and sweet malts add a nice level of complexity.

Castle Eden Ale;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Camerons Brewery (UK);Production of Castle Eden has now ceased at Camerons, and the brewery at Seaham that bought the name have started to make it. The first batch (this is at the Dun Cow in Durham City) was dreadful and had to be returned, very pale and thin bodied with bitterness in the aftertaste, nothing at all like CEA. Camerons stepped in and made an “emergency” batch, but the Seaham brewery then brewed again and I never tasted that as it too was rejected. Watch this space. Update. 19th Oct 2017. The Seaham brewery made a batch that was drinkable, and CEAesque, but still not the body and still lighter in colour. Update. 23rd Oct 2017. Still being made at Hartlepool by Camerons. The Seaham lot still can’t get it
Camerons Nimmos XXXX;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Camerons Brewery (UK);I’ll have to re-rate this, I thought it was ok but I was so thirsty I couldn’t even blink. Caramel,fruity hoppage, watery finish, some bitterness. Not bad I suppose.
Camerons Nimmos XXXX;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Camerons Brewery (UK);Golden, quickly disappearing head. When I pour this one, the notes of hops and flower spreads around the table. The flavour has floral, hoppy notes of fruit. The bitterness is medium, but develops in the finish.

Camerons Nimmos XXXX;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Camerons Brewery (UK);"Quite hazy, dirty-orange beer with greenish shine; no head to speak of. Vague parsley nose, and a bit nutty (slightly ""overdue"" bottle). Both nutty and slightly grassy taste, some caramel apparent, even a bit toasted. Finish is metallic, but not really bitter. Very empty palate, watery MF, just a little burning sensation. If this ""gave the Northeast a reputation for strong flavoursome ales""... Oh, well, I’ve had TTLandlord aplenty, and I suppose it must be better on cask."

Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;always knew where we had gone to drink this when I was a kid. We just followed the trail of puke. Has to be drunk cold and fresh. Gets the job done but ditch the flat backwash no matter what. Only American beer I could get my cousins from the UK hammered on. Does taste like booze, oily and burns the roof of your mouth but has improved flavor over I remember it.
Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"12 oz. can. When I was in college, we used to drink these and say ""let’s go out and maximize."" Twenty five years ago, this was the strongest beer you could find. The alcohol is not at all hidden, there is a definite burn.

Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Oh, god. What a beer this is. I can feel my head pounding in the morning after splitting a 22 oz. of this and moving on to utica club. I believe that the exact flavour profile of this beer has become completely blurred in my mind due to a painfully high number of cigarettes smoked that evening. In short, this beer exists to get you drunk. The $2.18 plus deposit and tax that two of these babies cost you will bring you a morning of pain, regret and blank shame.
Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;I actually liked this malt liquor when I tried it. Then again I was on a drinking binge with a bunch of like minded Neanderthals. Goes great with chocolate cake for breakfast. Well, maybe Matt won’t be using that in their next ad campaign.
Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;8.99%, three of these 24 oz bottles and you will be swinging from the trees. This stuff really blew me away. Taste is a little overpowering, but when you're good and banged up, does it really matter?
Matt Maximus Super;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;While doing my Colt 45 review I remembered this beer from the 80's. It was harsh, but the fastet buzz from beer I ever had. I'm glad I have not seen it since.

City of Cambridge Boathouse Bitter;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;City of Cambridge Brewery;23rd April 2015: 500ml bottle shared with my wife in bright sunshine on our patio.

Bottle sampled at the Country Inn with beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, Rastacouere and Yowie.
River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy golden color with a ring of white lace. Aroma of malt, fruits and yeast. The flavor feels a bit off with a package of fruits and yeast. The body is light with a creamy texture and soft carbonation.
River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;The Lure: Fruity esters and wheaty cereals personify a Belgian origin. Soft caramel and honey sweetness benefits from some orange pith to diversify its reach. Interesting, but definitely not what is expected from the style designation. The Festivities: Rich caramel and honey combine to coat the phenolic haystack. Their slick sweetness works well with the pears and other fruity esters of the apparently Belgian yeast. Few hops can be detected, and raw grain keeps things fresh. Good, but I thought I had ordered a bock? Transcendence: Clothing can mask true natures easily.
River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;Hazy pale gold appearance, almost no head. Tartish sourdough and cerealic bready and floral nose. Banana touched doughiness is tamed by bandagey phenols and a beginning of cardboardy oxidation. Medium bodied, watery mouthfeel, rather sweet. Not very exciting.

River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;Same lame labels from this brewery - when will they realize that using a home inkjet printer for their beer labels just won't cut it? As for the brew, the aroma is sweet, yeasty and just plain terrific. I enjoyed the malt flavor, but the alcohol could have been more well-hidden. Overall, a decent effort and I'm glad to see them try to brew a challenging style.
River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;Hazy golden body with small off-white head. Aroma is fairly light, apple and light straw.

River Horse Roebling Bock;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;River Horse Brewing Company;Lightest looking bock I've ever seen, more like a hazy-orange wheat beer in appearance, with almost no head. Not promising. Nose is one-dimensional candy-sweet, all right but my hopes aren't increasing. Flavor also very sweet, sticky, tiny bit smoky, rather boring. This was really a nothing for a bock, a style I usually like a lot.
Mad Crab Sturgeon Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout;Mad Crab Restaurant and Brewery;Warm coffee & cocoa aroma deceives you for what you are about to taste - sour, stinging - very unpleasant.
Mad Crab Sturgeon Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout;Mad Crab Restaurant and Brewery;My 200th beer! Unbelieveably nice aroma, very strong roasted coffee smell. Thick, tan head that lasted. I was shocked at the dichotomy between the aroma and flavor though. It tastes very sharp and sour, not what I was expecting at all. It was very hard to drink.

Mad Crab Buzz Beer;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mad Crab Restaurant and Brewery;Obviously borrowed the name from the Drew Carey Show (Strongsville is pretty close to Cleveland).

Mad Crab Pirates Pilsner;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Mad Crab Restaurant and Brewery;Huge bubbled foam atop a light golden liquid. Fresh, dry aroma including sour apples, plaster, and oxidation. Far too much carbonation, bottle conditioned, to make this work. Finishes extremely dry and numbing. Why waste time on such a beer? Practically worthless.
Mad Crab Pirates Pilsner;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Mad Crab Restaurant and Brewery;I don't know if it was the glass or the beer - but I smelled vinegar. The taste wasn't bad - but I still don't care for pilsners.

Theakston Prince of Ales;Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Theakston;Bottle conditioned. Bottled in 1981. This is a hearty ale with plenty of biscuit, rum and raison and burning alcohol. It has stood up well. One of those moments when your mouth is both appalled and delighted. This is disgusting and wonderful at the same time.
Darwin Evolution Ale;Sunderland, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Darwin Brewery;500ml bottle, Bowes Christmas Market. Golden amber colour, white foam head and malty, yeasty aroma.

Darwin Evolution Ale;Sunderland, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Darwin Brewery;Tasted this at the Paisley Beer Festival in April 2001. Cask, gravity dispense. Clear dark amber in colour with a thin buff head. Stunning aroma with burning peat hags and carmelised orange notes - wonderful stuff. Smooth oily mouthfeel and good lacing. Mixed malts give a robust maltloaf base with caramel, molasses and orange peel notes evident. Citric hops give a dry fruity aftertaste long in intensity. Malt returns in the toffee and orange oil finish. An excellent session bitter and well recommended.
Darwin Evolution Ale;Sunderland, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Darwin Brewery;A Mes rate: Cask at the Wenlock (I think). Fresh and hoppy all round with some grapefruit and a crisp and very bitter finish. Very dry but not in a bad way. Decent beer.

Darwin Killer Bee;Sunderland, Tyne & Wear, England;Strong Ale - English;Darwin Brewery;I'd actually like to speak a bit about a different Killer Bee than is listed - the one from Tin Whistle of Penticton, BC. This dark honey beer has an understated complexity, where you can find such diverse flavours as tobacco, chocolate, coffee, malt, smoke, and honey. The beer has that honey-ish crispness, and is made from 5 malts, 3 hops, 4 honeys and some spice.

Lancaster Amish Four Grain Ale;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lancaster Brewing Co.;"Transferred from BA reviewed on 2-1-12 - Poured from bottle into pint glass. Appearance - Pours a rusty–copper color with a off white head; the color not quite so” pale” as the categorization implies. The head fades leaving very little lacing. Smell –Rye maltiness is the main aroma detected. This maltines however is mixed with a fair degree of sweeter aromas as well; mainly some caramel and toffee as well as some wheat and an ever so light toasted nut, which seems almost none existent in the beginning, but shows up at the end. Taste – Sweet caramel and rye malt are the backbone of the brew and seem ever present. A very light hop spiciness, mostly earthy in , is present at the start, but seem to fade quite fast, giving way to an even greater level of sweetness, with the caramel flavor mixing with some lighter fruit flavors,;a bit of banana, and some other sweeter flavors of vanilla. The taste transition is light and very smooth. Quite nice!! Mouthfeel – The rye flavor seems to blanket the tongue with a nice creaminess; a much creamier tongue feel then would have been expected. The carbonation level seems to be right on par, making it a very easy drinking and enjoyable brew. Overall – This is quite nice and very flavorful brew. The rye and sweet flavors and aroma are all quite smooth and enjoyable."

This is a good IPA, but the flavor is pretty mild to me. Kind of an empty finish as well. What I do taste is all good, but I’m left wanting a little more. Overall this is a good beer though, very drinkable. Smooth flavor. Good stuff.
Big Time Baghwan's Best IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;Draft at big time. My 3rd attempt to rate this. Clear amber pour. Citrus (lemon), toast, sweat, even some bubblegum. Lightly sweet, no caramel, bitter finish. Pretty okay.
Big Time Baghwan's Best IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;Rating the cask version, which is a lot better than the standard. Super hazy orange color with a thick long lasting head. Well done appearance for a cask. Very fresh bouquet of C hops with the yeast and malts of a British IPA (tea, biscuit). As is often for their beers its like London but with fresh American hops.
Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Hazy orange brown with a decent meringue tan head. Nice hoppy aroma of citrus and pine. A touch of toasty malt. Flavors of bitey hops move nicely into a pleasant maltiness that adds a fruity characteristic to the brew. Finishes with a nice moderate citrus and floral hop profile. A touch of dry resins in the finish.

Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Dark amber with thin head. Nicely balanced with notes of caramel and light grapefruit hops in the finish. Not very sweet. Good session beer, and would be a nice cask selection. Not bad, but not the most memorable beer either. Just another solid seasonal from Big Time.
Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Cloudy amber body with a soft white head. Light, pale malt backbone with soft fruit notes and a soft, citric hop presence. Very soft mouthfeel and a nice, floral hop note on the finish. A tad watery but overall a nice example of the style.
Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Draft at Brouwer’s. Looks like this one is back with a vengeance. Pours a somewhat grainy and fairly opaque dark brown with caramel highlights. Thick and creamy dark tan head. Smells biscuity with a little bit of crackers there as well. Creamy medium body, very soothing and quenching right off. Biscuit, a bit of iced tea, and some light woody hop on the mid-palate. Definitely a very smooth and drinkable beer, easily a session champ. The flavor profile doesn’t look like much in print but it’s a nice one.
Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Hazy, dull amber. Almost anisey note in the otherwise fruity aroma. Lightly bitter with a sweet malt kiss. Light apricot, pear, and lime fruitiness. Malts are mainly pale. Subtle character. Finishes with a little bit of late acidity.

Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Bright red-amber beer with a creamy thick off-white head. Nice herbal, spicy hop aroma. Nice sweet malts, a bit of cherry fruitiness. Very woody hop flavour, fairly sweet with a nice resiny hop flavour. Lingering chewy bitterness. A nice pint.
Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;On tap at the Big Time Brewery in Seattle Pours dark orange-amber with a limited head. The aroma is dominated by the hops, but the flavor itself is surprisingly driven by sweet dried apricot and caramel malts, to the degree that it seems somewhat out of its listed category, ESB. This is a reasonable enough beer, and it made for pleasant drinking, though it’s not an outstanding offering.
Big Time Rainfest ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Copper. More hops than malt in the aroma. Very hoppy and malty flavour. Similar to Matts IPA, again with a lot of sweetness.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Draft at BT. Clear gold pour. Aroma: green apples overwhelm the nose on this. Taste of honey, alcohol, apple, perfume. Sweet, with slight bitterness in the finish. Full body, soft carbonation, syrupy texture.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Tap @ the brewpub. Nice head with good duration. Color is golden. Aroma and taste are yeast, fruits, sugary notes, malt and hops.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Pours murky golden with minimal head. Smell is clove, a bit of banana, gum, and citrus. Taste is sweet and hoppy, a bit like La Fin Du Monde, but more hops, strong orange flavor on the finish. Decent.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Hmm...smells okay, but unfortunately this actually is a bit more alcoholic in flavor than I’d like. Some spices later, but not too strong, and not enough to cover the alcohol taste.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;2011 Belgianfest – Seattle, WA Golden yellow in color, clear with a thick white head.

Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;On cask at San Diego Real Ale Fest, Carlsbad (6/12/09): Pours a hazy golden bronze with a well-lacing frothy white head. Aroma of sweet fruity esters and toasty pale Belgian malts. Starts with good fullness and rich Belgian malty complexity with some doughy balance and coriander spice before a semi-sweet, drier finish. A pretty good and enjoyable Belgian strong ale.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Hazy dark golden with a lingering white sheen. Big yeasty, candi sugar, light pit fruit aromas. Medium body. Sticky sweet flavors of light pit fruits candi sugar and earthy yeast. Too sweet but still tasty. Draft@ Big Time.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Poured on draft at Naked City. Hazy, muddy orange, with a small, off-white head. This may have some of the notes of a tripel, but this is extremely undercarbonated for that style. Almost flat. A big hop presence, but not as crisp or fresh of hops as I’m used to - more like a subdued amount of something you’d find in a Port anniversary IPA. The aroma is very mild, and the flavor - while it has some of the characteristics of a tripel (spices, yeast, citrus) - falls miles short of what I expect of the style. If it didn’t claim to be a tripel, I might like this a bit more. It’s tasty, but something of a disappointment.
Big Time Trombipulator;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Big Time Brewery;Clear golden with a dense white head. Sweet yeasty aroma balanced with some spices. Lots of banana, clove and citrus in the flavor, finishes off dry.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;Poured a dark copper brown, with a little haze, and a light head which quickly dissipated. It had a great malty, smoky aroma. With a hint of fruit, apples plum, dates. Taste was a disappointment. The start hits with a big malt/grain blast super sweet, and some carmel and fruit notes. In the middle the sweetness takes over the flavor, and that follows through the end. I am far from a hop head, but where is the bitterness, and balance to the beer. The mouthfeel was as expected for a quality brewery, and the drinkability suffers from the poor balance of the beer.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;Tawney auburn colored with a small light tan head. Big banana and light brown sugar aroma. Moderate body, livly carbonation. Rich malt slighty sweet. Complex bus atertaste. Very nice.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;A little tangy in the aroma. Dark muddy color. Red/brown. Smokey interesting flavor but nothing out of the ordinary. A little light.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;Probably totally mislabelled by Big Time as a weizen bock, but still an absolutely fantastic wheat. Murky dark brown, OK head, but perfect lacing. Big spicy clove nose. Flavor was a great balance, caramel and a wonderful burst of esters, restrained bananas, and clean clove flavors. Spicy bitterness on finish. Top notch, I really liked this. Tap at pub.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;Draught End-of-scale dark brown with a red & olive shine. Very dense small head, yellow. Banana, cloves, sweet apple, the whole shebang. Even some bread. At least, it’s true to style. Sweet, fruity esters, yeasty with a very high level of restsweetness. Fusels and even phenols, coloured malt. Full bodied, slick but a bit cloying. Just OK Dunkelweizen. 5% ABV is not a Bock, and neither was it announced as such in the pub.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;Another one of my favorites, not quite as big as I like in this style, but still a tasty session sipper. Rich and slightly spicy, with a heavy mouthfeel, that has kind of a chewy maltiness. Fruity with a somewhat sour finish.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;"On tap at the brewery. Pours a muddy light brown;the aroma is pungent with sizzling bacon. The taste is strong, rye-spicy, and idiosyncratic; lots of yeast with a bitter if slightly metalic finish. Palate is thick, hard to believe it’s only a 5% beer; the overall drops slightly short of the sum of the parts."
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;draft. very thin head an what was there had a combination of large and fine bubbles, full rich aroma, cloudy brown red, unique flavor and finish.
Big Time Slam Dunkel Weizenbock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Big Time Brewery;Dark and unfiltered, but with a light body look as well. Nice, full wheaty taste with a bit of bitterness on the finish. A solid beer for all seasons and one of the better beers of the dunkelweizen style. Rerate: 5-06-03: This time the beer had a barrel aged quality with the appearance of complexity adding vinegar notes in aroma and taste. This shaped the beer differently, in fact, maybe it was a different recipe, but just as good.
Big Time Beam Me Up Scottish Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Big Time Brewery;(Draught) Sampled at Big Time Brewpub in Seattle on March 2, 2007. Lasting white head with a light mahogany body. Another milky smell with strong malt basis. Initial scotch flavour with a heavy malt finish. Average beer.
Big Time Beam Me Up Scottish Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Big Time Brewery;My impression of this was that it tastes like they threw a few bottles of cheap whiskey into a pale ale. I like Scottish ales alot, too, and this one was just so one dimensional. No body, too pale and dry, and really just not a very good example of the style, if nothing else.
Big Time Beam Me Up Scottish Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Big Time Brewery;A good peaty, malty, earthy scottish ale with a slightly nutty finish. Slightly thin

Big Time Beam Me Up Scottish Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Big Time Brewery;This is odd.Almost perfect texture in mouth - chewy, heavy viscous - but lacking in flavors. Tastes almost like an English brown.
Big Time Beam Me Up Scottish Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Big Time Brewery;Cloudy brown with an off-white-yellow head. Sweet floral/fruity aroma. Semi-sweet favor with quite a bitter kick (for a scottish ale anyhow). Mouthfeel somewhat on the thin side, but smooth. Good brew.
Big Time Beam Me Up Scottish Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Big Time Brewery;"This cola-brown ale was a little disappointing at first sight: slightly hazy with a fairly light, fuzzy head---aroma slightly sweet, slightly fruity, but the watchword here is ""slight."" As for flavor, the keyword is ""subtle."" Malt is detected mostly in the body, and contributes to a very nice mouthfeel. Hops, meanwhile, stand out most in the medium dry finish, which fills the back of the palate. There is nothing wrong with this ale--but it is almost annoyingly plain...Smooth and full-bodied it is, but somehow the character of this ""Scottish"" ale got lost in the transporter beam and landed somewhere else--unfortunately, far from the land of kilts and cabers."
Big Time Old Wooly Barleywine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;Copper. Powerful sweet booze up front. Caramel, sweet ripe fruit, dough, toffee, and more booze. Finish is lingering boozy heat and a sweet toffee note forms, as well. Medium to full bodied. I wasn’t expecting quite the boozy profile but once I got past that it was really a nice BW.
Big Time Old Wooly Barleywine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;On tap at Hopvine. Impressive, even to my two friends who don’t usually care for large beers but found this one complex and clean. Has that crispness so more the spirit of a cocktail than a beer. Tasted like it was barrel aged but it wasn’t--alcohol and wood, hops largely int he background but not much overt sweetness either.
Big Time Old Wooly Barleywine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;[3/2/15] Draught at Big Time Brewery in Seattle. Clear amber.

Big Time Old Wooly Barleywine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;2008 Bottle (from box) Courtesy of Edmund Edmunds Pours a deep red color, plenty hazy with a really small wispy ol’ head. The aroma is rich, it’s got lots of caramel, some cooked fruit, some brown sugar... invitingly sweet smelling. The flavor is rich & sweet, it’s got loads of toffee, lots of fruity cherry and apple bits. There is a touch of bitterness left in it, but that’s pretty light. Some vanilla rounds it out well. The mouthfeel is big, but lightly sharp. A real chill boost.

Tastes of all the same things in the smell with slight dark fruit in the flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy but slight chewy with ok carbonation and a dry finish. Overall its pretty average for a barleywine. I was expecting a little more out of it it seemed a little off balanced Maybe it will taste better with age.

A nice way to finish the quarter. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Big Time Old Wooly Barleywine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;Bomber of 2012 Vintage. Pours a dark burgundy and amber color with a layer of light reddish brown foam. Lots of orange, grapefruit peel and pine resin in the aroma followed by some caramel, malt and dark fruit in the background. The flavor is heavy on the hops resin and citrus rind upfront leading to notes of brown sugar, honey, raisin and toffee. The body is moderately thick and creamy with low carbonation and a citrusy, alcohol-warming finish. Overall, it’s significantly hoppy fresh but should be a lot maltier and smoother with a few years of age on it. Well done.

Big Time Yulefest Christmas Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Time Brewery;Draft at Big Time. Pours dark brown -- I’d like to say there was a reddish tint to it, but I’d be making that up. Aroma: dark fruit mostly, along with a little Christmas spice. Taste: Sweet up front, light bitterness, short finish. Palate: medium body, slick texture. Overall: I’m sticking to Old Rip for the next round, but this is nice enough (I feel like I use that phrase a lot with Big Time, but it sums up a lot -- solid beers that are executed nicely enough, with really nothing to complain about).

Big Time Scarlet Fire IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Clear darker yellow pour with a white head. Hard to describe the hop notes, perhaps citrusy. Good body, balance, and mouthfeel.
Big Time Kingfisher Best Bitter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Big Time Brewery;(Draft: Big Time Brewery and Alehouse in Seattle, WA) So, the beers here tend to have a funky aroma. Again, a stinky feet aroma creeps into the nose, though not as obvious as the Blonde. Otherwise, it smells somewhat sweet and grainy. Flavor is sweet and caramely, somewhat grainy, mildly bitter. Light golden colored body, small off-white head. Some patchy lacing is left along the top of the glass as the head fades to a ring. Not bad, but it’s basically just generic microbrewed beer to me.
Big Time Kingfisher Best Bitter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Big Time Brewery;A slant of brilliance, like slits of light through slats of the roof. Good times. Yeah, bitters.
Big Time Snowmelt American Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;Nitrogen tap at pub. Light orange, nitro cream head. Fresh PNW hop nose, definite bit of spruce. Very smooth, fruity, orange, grapefruit, sight pine. Malts balanced bit didn’t really do much for the flavor. Tasty overall, an excellent APA.
Big Time Snowmelt American Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;"Draught Good, very fine yellowish & dense head; hazy orange-amber ale. Very grapey-hoppy nose, grapefruit, sweet-bitter, even in the nose. Sweetish, with a building-up bitterness, fruity, but less outspoken grapefruit flavour. Even more hops in the finish, balance however remains right. Creamy, the nitro helping, smooth but not cloying. OK, I’m not a big fan of nitrokeg, but here it seems to help the brewer fight the yeast/balance control problems. So why should I complain?"
Big Time Snowmelt American Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;A very nice fragrant floral aroma, hoppy but also tame, not aggresive and over the top, just right. Has a very pleasant honey, graham cracker maltiness, very light bodied, just light overall, this could be a great APA, if it was a little bigger.
Big Time Snowmelt American Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;"On cask at the Big Time. The beer pours a cloudy honey. Great big wonderful nose of floral cascade hops; this beer has an out-of-this-world hop aroma. Unfortunately, the flavor and mouthfeel simply can’t back up the promise that the nose offers; they’re too weak on the malt, too hollow, too thin to come through with anything like what one is anticipating given the nose. On the other hand, I might have been somewhat less disappointed had I realized this was a 3.6% beer and adjusted my palate expectations accordingly. I’d certainly drink it again happily, especially at lunchtime if one doesn’t want a beer pack the full punch of one of their better 7 or 8% strong ales. Coming back to this beer a second time on cask (and yet again on tap) and knowing that I was getting a 3.6%, I was even more impressed. I’ve bumped the rating upward a few points accordingly. If this beer tasted half as good as it smells, it would be darn near unbeatable under 4%. Unfortunately, even the foreknowledge that you’re dealing with a 3.6% beer doesn’t entirely cut the watery disappointment that follows the sublime aroma."
Big Time Snowmelt American Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;On Nitro: My rating may be effect by this. Orangy colour with a typical creamy nitro head. Nitro probably took some of the hop flavour but it did still have some nice hop aroma. Flavour was slightly bitter with the hops but balanced nicely with malts. Would like to try it without nitro some time.
Big Time Snowmelt American Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;The pub was serving this on nitro when I went, but I'm not adding the nitro version as a separate beer because I can't figure out that rule. It was served to me in full cascading mode and it took a while for the show to end. Clear orange with a creamy head typical of nitro beers. I was expecting all the hop flavors to be washed out by the nitro, but not at this place. The Cascade hops ride high on a strong, malt backbone. Great use of nitro.

Big Time Snowmelt American Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;Was called bitter the first time I had it.Lightly spiced hop nose. Flavor is also lighlty spiced but seems lacking in hops. Rather light and thin.
Big Time Snowmelt American Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Time Brewery;Hints of spiciness in the bouquet are what is expected of a winter brew. Honey-colored, with a pleasantly spicy body that is smooth, but a little light on the underside--with a finishing hoppy piquance. Rerate: Much better than I remembered (this is on nitro)--bronze with a creamy head--and honeyed hops. A nice APA to encounter in the winter.

Big Time Frostys Spiced Winter Warmer;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Time Brewery;Deep ruby color with a root beer head. The nose hinted at the spices to come, but it did not give any indication of the size and scope of the flavor. Tons of ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and other spices that seemed backed up by an almost chocolate sweetness. The hops were only allowed to come out at the very end. Very smooth mouthfeel but very aggresive spices. I bet it would mellow nicely, but there is no way it will last that long.
Big Time Frostys Spiced Winter Warmer;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Time Brewery;This refreshingly winter-redolent beer is remarkably true to its name.

Big Time Matts Red Eye IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;"Draft at the brewpub. Pours deep leathery brown and quite hazy. Thin sudsy tan head. Very neutral nose; inoffensive. Medium body, active carb, resin-forward attack. Piney burny resiny bitter body and a long tobacco resin bitter cling finish. Barkeep mentioned that it has some roast malt in it; maybe under all the flavors I’m picking up is mainly roast. Nice stuff. Maybe not the most refreshing IPA in the world, but complex and satisfying and drinkable,"
Big Time Matts Red Eye IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;"Dark red, cloudy (of course), with a rocky head. Rich woody aroma, lots of subtle grapefruit and orange underneath. Slightly caramel-accented malt aromas. Rich and supple caramelly, woodsy malts and soft but insistent bitterness. Beautiful woody notes, light citrus, and faint chocolate. Excellent brew - almost the caramel taste of a great ""Irish"" red but with IPA hops."
Big Time Matts Red Eye IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;Tap at the brewery. This is IPA #100 for me. Pours dark, dark orange amber for an IPA. The aroma is a lovely, classic centennial IPA: grapefruit and peaches and a bit of spicy pine. The flavor is equally nice: not heavily burnt-malted despite its dark color, just tasty hops not hitting too hard, almost like a Drakes Expedition or similar heavily-hopped amber ale. Mildly sweet but not sticky, a very characteristic Big Time flavor to this one. Fairly light body and palate, but that just makes this one wonderfully drinkable. A very nice beer and worth trying any time it is on tap.

Big Time Powderfinger Rye Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Time Brewery;Decent tap beer. The rye is not showing a typical spicy character, nor do we get much IPA/hoppy profile. A quaffer.

Pretty good Irish Dry Stout.
Big Time Buck Mulligans Dublin Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Big Time Brewery;Cask-cond’d version @ brewpub. Not much head on an opaque black beer. Aroma of simple coffee, some creamer, butter, and Coffee Crisp candy bar. Hardly any co2 but has a nice silkiness. Good smoky flavors and love the sweet soft licorice in the background.

Big Time Buck Mulligans Dublin Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Big Time Brewery;Sampled @ Big Time, April 2007 Pours with a rich, creamy, nitrogen generated head that has a brown tinged, tan color. The beer is simply black, when analyzed in this pub atmosphere. The aroma is rich with notes of toasty malt, chocolate, a touch of coffee aromatics and a hint of burn raisin adds some unexpected fruitiness. The beer tastes dry and fairly bitter in the finish. The bitterness seems to be driven by the burnt malt notes rather than by hops. A touch of coffee flavors are here, focusing on roast bean flavors. This has a very creamy mouthfeel to it, which is typical of a degassed nitrogenated brew. The finish has a lingering, toasted, dry grain character to it. This is a good easy drinking brew, and a definite step up from draught Guinness.

Big Time Neighsayer Oatmeal Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Time Brewery;A lover of oatmeal stouts--this was a bit of a twist. Rich amber in appearance with a cream head giving off a feint, but pleasant oatmeal odor and tasting silkily and gently of oatmeal. A cross between a stout and a cream ale, althought the commercial description tells it is really an English bitter.

Big Time Hopfest;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;"Crystal. On tap at the brewery 12/30/05.Pours a pale, slightly cloudy amber with a modest head. The malt stays in the background, showcasing the cops but balancing nicely; the hops themselves offer with a lovely dry bitterness without the strong citrus-and-pine of many of the popular PacNW varieties. The mouthfeel is good, and the beer is superbly drinkable. (As an aside, I’d call this an American Pale Ale rather than an IPA.) 7/3/9/4/17=4.0. Amarillo. On tap at the brewery 7/22/06. Pours cloudy amber orange with a nice fluffy head. The aroma is divine, a piney, citric wonderment of Amarillo hops. The flavor - well, let’s not pretend that this is a complex or subtle beer. It’s not. It’s hop juice, and I mean than in a good way. This one is plain and simple a showcase for the hops, and with lovely hops like these, that actually works quite well. I pick up a bit too much alcohol and resin in the flavor (and the malts are hiding like scared fieldmice) but the hops come through with more big juicy flavor than bitterness, despite the fact that this is not a particularly sweet IPA. On the whole it works very well, and makes me glad to work just a few blocks from the Big TIme so that I can sample this sort of thing regularly. 9/4/7/3/15=3.8. The batch I sampled 6/18/09 was better rounded, less over the top than my notes indicate about the first go-around -- though some of this may have been that it was on cask. Mt Rainier. Tap at the brewery 7/4/2007. For me, this was a first encounter with this Hallertau-family hop variety. The aroma is modest but enjoyable; the flavor comes through not powerfully but with a pleasant complexity that compensates for the relatively thin malt backbone of the beer. It’s not at all a pine and orange blast like most of the Big Time IPAs, but rather we get a somewhat resiny, mildly floral, mildly spicy, well-balanced hop flavor that renders it a delicously drinkable beer, lighter in feel than Scarlet Fire or Baghwan’s. Nice! 7/4/8/4/15=3.8 Liberty. Tap at the brewery 12/21/07. Pours a cloudy amber with a nice head and strong lacing. Sweet, gentle nose of candied gummi peach and overripe bartlett pear. While the opening flavor is likewise sweet and soft, orchard juice warmed by gentle candied malt, it quickly turns to a bitter and somewhat astringent finish atop a noticeable diacetyl . The hops close soapy with a bit of grapefruit pith. Spot-on mouthfeel, the carbonation textured but not aggressive. Pretty good, but not among my favorites of their IPAs or even of their their hopfest varieties. 7/3/7/4/14=3.5 Ahtanum. Tap at the brewery 7/16/08. This hop makes for a really nice fruity IPA, on the sweet side but not sticky, just not aggressively bitter. Citrus and amarillo-like tropical fruits/peaches, a hint of wood. I really like this stuff. 8/4/8/4/15 =3.9"
Big Time Hopfest;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;Murky red-amber with a foamy white head and nice lacing. Light citrus and pine hops in the nose. Toasted malts.

Big Time Hopfest;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Hazy amber. Fruity and sweet with soft mouthfeel.

Big Time Hopfest;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;(Draft: Big Time Brewery and Alehouse in Seattle, WA) I’ve liked every single-hop beer featuring Simcoe hops I’ve tried, and it continues with this offering. It’s citrusy, grapefruity, but somewhat mild mannered. Lightly sweet pale malts provide a solid yet gentle base for the hops. Grapefruit really takes ahold of the finish. Similar characteristics in the nose, it’s grapefruity and hoppy, with a lightly sweet maltiness. Seems every bit as bitter as their standard IPA. Hazy amber color is darker than the IPA but the off-white head shows the same fade to a ring, and intricate lacing seems limited to the top part of the glass. Nice tasting beer that does a nice job of showcasing the Simcoe hops, but it doesn’t excite my senses.

Ingos Hammer Lager;Halmstad, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Krönleins Bryggeri;[Bottled, rating from 1998] Ingo, that is the former world heavyweight boxing champion Ingemar Johansson, was given the dubious honours to have a beer called after him. As all beer with this kind of trendy marketing most of it’s character is on the outside bottle rather than inside, because this was one of Krönlein’s more boring offerings. It still has a little bit of that freshness that I like with Krönleins though. It poured pale yellow. The body is extremely light (for a heavy weight champion), and had no bite at all.
Three Hearts Julöl Extra Strong;Halmstad, Sweden;Bock - Doppelbock;Krönleins Bryggeri;"Rating from way back. A dark brown/red-coloured beer.

Aroma of caramelized malt with light toffee notes is enjoyable. Taste is also a mix of caramelized malt notes, some toffee with some residual sugar notes. Body is about average with good carbonation.

Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;30-Jul-17 (12-oz bottle: Purchased 09-Apr-07 for $5.58 at Liquid Solutions in Tigard, OR) This aged Barley Wine pours a very hazy, amber-brown body, but just a ring of large bubbles because when I popped the cap, there was no carbonation rush. So, yeah, it's pretty close to flat. The nose is earthy and very caramely, with aromas of wort, decayed logs, toffee, and some milk chocolate. On the palate, lots and lots of caramel, but it's not nearly as sweet as expected. Earthy logs, lightly toasted bread, fig, and dried apricot, but the finish is strangely reminiscent of a slightly smoky Pilsener like the famous Urquell. The beer is medium-full in weight, low in carbonation, and because it's not that sweet and there's a touch of earthy acidity, it's not heavy or cloying in the least. Overall, with the exception of the low carbonation due to the twist top, this is very tasty and enjoyable.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;Boozy with lots of caramel. Pours hazy orange with good head and lacing. Bittersweet boiled down with tobacco. Tap at brewery.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;August 8, 2014 - with blankboy, gregclow, jercraigs and mabel. Bomber. Ruby-copper pour, nice creamy tan mottled head. Hoo yeah, US barleywine aroma all right - alcohol, floral/resin bitterness - lots of sweet cereal/gluten grain. Taste follows - strong, malty and big bitterness to match - just the thing (8+). Solid body, chewy, decent carbonation - big mellow bitter/boozy/malty finish ... I would grab this again in a shot.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;Bomber, 2012 vintage. Caramel malt aroma with notes of peaty smoke, dark fruit and grassy and floral hops. Pours cloudy caramel colored with a thin tan head that has little retention or lacing. Starts with caramel malt and dark fruit flavors with peaty smoke notes. Finishes dry with grassy and floral hops as well as light citrus hops. Pretty good barleywine.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;This gets worse as it goes along. Smells nicely of grass and molasses, with a nice similar first flavor. However, it gets sweeter the deeper in the bottle get, which, for a 2-year old bottle isn’t great. Maybe it’ll mellow out even more as it gets older, but I was hoping for a bit more here.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;It pours cloudy medium brown with a tinge of orange and a light brown head. The aroma has plenty of sweet malt with bread and caramel. It also has aroma of plums and floral elements. It also has hints of citrus that is orange like. The malt is predominant with a balance between the esters and hops in the background. The malt flavors are sweet with the hop balance being somewhat aggressive with a moderate alcohol element in the taste. It has bread and caramel malt richness in the flavors with floral hops and citrus that in orange like. There are also hints of plums and the alcohol does has a hint of whiskey element in it as well. It has a chewy body with moderately high alcohol warming that is a slight tinge hot, but not unpleasant. It is somewhat dry and the floral hops and dryness linger on the palate. Overall, this is a malt forward barley wine that is moderately hop aggressive as the beer warms.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;2013 vintage. Nice maltiness, caramel and clove. Was a bit of medicinal taste on first sip. Pretty rounded as you might expect with a three year old barleywine.
Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;22oz bottle, winter 2015 edition. Hazy dark amber, with a thin but lasting head, and spotty lace. Aroma is malty, caramel, smoke, peat, raisin.

Pike Old Bawdy;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pike Brewing Company;Pours a hazy reddish brown. Aromas of hops, caramel malts, kind of medicinal. Flavor is to strong for me, big alcohol taste, malty with a citrus taste.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;Draft at Pike Pub in Seattle, WA. Dark body, small head. Alcohol noticeable for such a light brew. Good deal of hops with some lingering woodiness.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;For those with a zest for dark porters, the Pike Old 89 is a wise choice. Pours a dark amber-brown body with a handsome tan head. Described as a modern version of an old world beers, Old 89 heads out much like an English stout, while coming at you with rich coffee tonus and closing with a particularly malleable, lightsome finish.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;on tap at the brewpub. quite dark with a thin, lasting off-white head. some cocoa powder and whipped cream in the aroma, smooth and drinkable, faint tartness and a little after dinner mint
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;Tap at brewpub. Good nose, choc/coffee/mocha. Little egg or salty too. Classic brown/ black color. Good head that faded. Sweet and bitter flavors, chocolate/ soap/ tinny. Thin bodied, sweet dry finish. Slightly off from a classic porter. Just alright.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;hat this on tap and it was pretty good, I compare it as a tasty version of guniess. It was very creamy with decent lacing, and the taste was very full, very much a decent porter. I will go with this one again if I go back.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;Had it on Tap, was supprised on this rendition of the old classic. My buddy thought it was better than a good Guiness I didn’t agree but still thought it was a damn good nitro brew. I did pick up a bit of ’wateriness’ that was a bit dristracting and the creaminess wasn’t up to par with what I look for in a Guiness style beer. But all in all this is brew can stand w/ the best of what I normally find of tap in Washington.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;Dark brown/ruby, tan light head/lacing. The aroma is chocolaty with some mocha & coffee. Watery, metallic. The flavor is salty with some astringent malts. Very light and too dry.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;Bottle(sample bottling) pours black with brown highlights, nice cream colored frothy head, with clingy lacing.   Roasted malts and a major amount of butter on the nose.   Forwardly butter like with minor roasted malt flavor.   By the middle and through to the finish the flavor falls off the boat and is completely gone after I swallow.   Maybe a light flavor of coffee or dark chocolate on the exit, but VERY light.   Body and mouthfeel are decent, but this is one that I will soon forget.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;Tap@Pike. Sweet caramel and toast, some roasted malt, soft and light. Also noticed odd aromas of sweat and nappies, which made it a bit more interesting.
Pike Old 89 Nitro Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Pike Brewing Company;This actually surprised the hell out of me. I tend to find nitro beers watered down beyond belief and aching to be gulped...not this one. This was wonderfully balanced between the roasted barley and great chocolate notes. I would be lying if I said this didn't carry with it the nitro characteristic of a less-than-full aroma, but the appearance makes up for it right?
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;Nitro tap@ Pike. Clear golden color with lasting white head. Light apricot, dusty pale malt, wheaty yeasty aromas. Super smooth medium body. Lightly tart wheat flavors with mild clove, banana yeast, and mild earth____smooth easy finish---not bad.
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;"""there were only a couple brews at Pike that i DIDN’T like, but this was the worst of em. A weak ass beer, even for a hefe. a muddled slightly unpleasant aroma atop an unassuming beer in both body and flavor. one to avoid."""
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;Not included in the Sampler, so I ordered a glass after I tried all the rest. It was a good decision as this is a decent Hefeweizen.

Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;2010-07-05. Crisp dark yellow with a small white head. 3+ Mild aroma is lightly estery, touch of wheat. Flavour is thinner than hoped, fruity esters, tart grainy wheat in the finish lingers in the aftertaste. Average palate. bit dull but okay. On tap at Pike Place brewpub, Seattle
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;Draught at Brewpub, Seattle, WA, USA. Slightly hazy pale golden colour with small white head. Citrus, wheat and spices in aroma. Wheat, sweetish fruits, citrus and some mild hops in flavour. Slightly thin.
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Served with lemon, which took over the nose. Some banana, clove, and ginger in there too. A bland American wheat ale cum weizen. Banana, lemon, and ginger in the mouth. Not very crisp or refreshing. Mediocre.
Pike Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;"Tap at the brewpub. I suggest this is more of a wheat beer than a hefe. Eh. Hazy golden amber with a creamy white head. Mild malt/wheat aroma. Medium body; mild carbonation. Flavor is light wheat/malt with a little Belgian yeast/spice. Hints of fruit. Very refreshing. Might be some citrus, but they stuck a lemon on it. So?"

Pike XXXXX Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pike Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery. Opaque with a frothy, tan head. Aroma of chocolate and dark roast coffee. Smooth and creamy.
Pike XXXXX Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pike Brewing Company;65cl bottle at home (27 IV 2019), as Pike XXXXX Stout. Allready shared such a bottle at a beer geeks gathering, now let's have this world class stout a go at a more convenient pace. The black tanned brew with orange-red to even brown gloom - never being sticky, whatsoever - comes with almost no foam. The beer is pitch-black at its core. The nose has a typical dry stout character, with a herbal and even creamy body. Think of black chocolate, of course, but also several hints at cacao, cigar, chocolate ice cream topping. The roasted malts are omnipresent. The mouthfeel is very soft, with just a hidden carbonation at best. The body is a sour, with different bitter chocolate and smoked malt features. Sweetness is unresponsive, which is nice. This continues being a good-old stout, so don't expect an explosion of taste sensations. The warming alcoholic touch is smooth and restrained. Here again, one can just feel those creamy, yeasty dashes. At the end, a caramel feeling drops in - making this a great treat.
Pike XXXXX Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pike Brewing Company;Ingredients: Water, Malt, Hops, and Yeast....Plain and simple. A nice chocolate stout with good hop finish. Balance close to perfect for this style. Similar to the new Guiness Foreign Extra. This is my first sample from Pike and is a nice start. Solid beer that I would try again.
Pike XXXXX Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pike Brewing Company;19-Aug-17 (22-oz bottle: Purchased 14-Mar-07 for $4.30 at Liquid Solutions in Tigard, OR) This Stout pours a black body and a thin, tan head due to lower carbonation from the extended cellaring. The nose is very roasty with lots of licorice, scorched earth, char, molasses, and old wood. On the palate, aged, earthy character and dark-roast dominate, with notes of chocolate, cocoa, some coffee, and molasses. The beer is medium in weight, medium-minus in carbonation, and very smooth on the palate. Overall, despite the long cellaring, this is still a very tasty and enjoyable Stout.
Pike XXXXX Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pike Brewing Company;Roast and dark chocolate. Light caramel but properly subdued. Pours black with good mocha head. Rich and fairly dry. Velvety texture. Bottlr.
Pike XXXXX Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pike Brewing Company;Excellent stout. Lots of bitter chocolates some dried fig and molasses but not too sweet. Typically all the stuff u want in a stout especially if u don’t like the too thick and syrupy type. Liking it more as I sip. Great balance of alcohol and fruit. Sexy beer!

Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;Somewhat grainey and rather dull, this beer sports a hint of roasted nuttiness, some sweet maltiness, but is overall pretty bland and boring.
Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;Deep brown beer. Very faint aroma. Some light nuttiness over the sweet caramel and a light cocoa note. Flavour is pretty bland and watery though. Light sweetness and a touch of nuttiness. Meh.

Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;on tap at pike. pretty decent brown ale. browny amber, caramel aroma, lightly nutty with a pleasant late saltiness in the finish
Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;Nut Browns tend to be smooth, but this was very much so. Mild malt, not so overwhelmingly flavorful, but loaded with caramel and slightly toasty nuttiness. Not the most palatable brown, with a malt loaded beer like this the palate should be a given, but this was a touch thin. Overall average, although tasty.
Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;Tap at brewpub, ok nose, lite roasty, carmel & chocolate with a touch of orange. Clean orange brown color.

Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;Amber mahogany with no head & some lacing. The aroma is like musky hop dishwater. The flavor is watery with some thick malt & a finish that really cries out for some hop or alcohol balance.
Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;Tap@Pike. This wasn’t too bad for a brown ale. Not too sweet or sickly, nice nutty malts and not much else, simple, but it tasted OK to me.
Pike Bootleg Brown;Seattle, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Pike Brewing Company;"On Tap Pours a bit darker than the Pike Pale Ale but is similar in taste. Floral with a small hop undertone and sweet malt. A slight ""woody"" aftertaste."
Pike Auld Acquaintance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pike Brewing Company;"Glad that I got this on clearance. 2nd sample from this brewer and liking what I am seeing so far. This is one of those simple beers. Description says ""lots of malt"", but the ingredients say ""malted barley, water, hops, yeast ......"" along with the other spices. Balance works well for me and is a nice representation of a winter ale. Does not seem that malty, and like a lighter version of a barleywine...or has that pale ale feel. Will look for this again next season."
Pike Auld Acquaintance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pike Brewing Company;Deep orange. Spice and orange zest with some caramel. Fruity, lightly toasted, medium bitterness. Light citrus tang. Decent.

Pike Auld Acquaintance;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pike Brewing Company;22oz bomber, this is the 3rd time I am buying this beer just to rate it. And you know I really want to rate it because its not a very positive review. Dark orange amber color. Head fades quickly. Aroma is sweet fruity and toasty. Nothing about that is fun or good. There are some poor spices, just a mix of bad stuff.
Black Horse Premium Lager;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pints out of the bottle at Harbour View Restaurant. Soaking wet cold and miserable with 4 hours before the ferry leaves Port Au Basques. Clear yellow lightly sweet and a bit grainy, cold and crisp. Its a macro lager, not anything you wouldn't expect cleanly made. The first one went down in record time as I slowly returned to somewhat normal. The next two paired well with the Greco pizza I savored before heading getting on the ship to head back home.
Black Horse Premium Lager;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottled. Clear yellow body with small white head. The taste is mellow and yeasty and there almost no finish.

Pours a light, clear straw with a large, light, white head. Aromas are too faint when cold. Tastes are standard macro lager (light grain, corn) with only a subtle hint of hops. Light body, crisp, fairly assertive carbonation and a medium grain finish. Inoffensive and easy drinking but not interesting. ---Rated via Beer Buddy
Black Horse Premium Lager;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Sampled from the tap at Maxwell’s Plum.

Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);This is inferior in all ways to any black and tan that you could possibly concoct on your own. Too sweet and watery by half for my tastes. More lager than Porter.
Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Bottle. Found some old notes. somewhat of a muddy brown in color, next to flat pour. It had somewhat of a roasted coffee aroma. Tasting revealed somewhat of a bitter lager porter mix. It had a watery body, and somewhat of an oily character. Not very good.
Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Bottle Poured a dark brown. Had aroma of grain and bubbles. Did not taste like a mix but rather a weak bock. Not awful but its gone now anyway.

Michelob Black and Tan;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I want to say this was the precursor to Amber bock, but this is terrible. No separation between the dark and the light, just an amberish dark brown color. Light and grainy and not quite horrid, but close.

Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;12oz bottle share in 2013. Deep brown with a tan head. Aroma of raisins, prunes, dates, dark malt and caramel. Fantastic mouthfeel in the beer. So much wonderful dried fruit and Christmas pudding flavour. Not too sweet, though. Such a shame you don’t see Dogfishhead in the UK anymore.
Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;2008 bottle reviewed on 4/5/19. Dark brown pour with a short-lived khaki head. German alt or maibock pruny esters on the nose. Prune and brown sugar flavors.
Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;2009 bottle, at a tasting in 2018. Hazy reddish amber with very small frothy beige head, woodsy sweet rum aroma, low carbonation, very boozy sweet taste, thin body, long finish. This is like drinking pure spirits!
Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;From May 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! The pour reveals a clear reddish amber liquid with a 2 finger head of foam and plenty of lacing. Very good head retention. The smell has notes of wood, bubblegum, candy sugar, and a fruitiness. The taste is....different. I get a musky flavour mixed with some caramel malt, along with bubblegum, some candy sugar, but, I can't get over the muskiness, if that is the proper way to describe it. Whole lot of alcohol going on in the taste as well, and too much warming for the abv, imho. I'm drinking this at near room temperature and maybe that isn't the way to go but under these conditions, it's not working for me at all. The body is definitely on the watery side for me.. I'm glad I got to try this brew but it just doesn't do it for me, unlike the majority of DFH's brews. 1 bottle is more than enough and I wouldn't seek this out again, for sure. To me, the flavours are a mess.
Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;May 28, 2017. Flight selection at DFH brewpub in Rehoboth. Outstanding Belgian strong...smoky, oak flavor...long caramel, sugary finish. Will be looking for this in the future.
Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;Originally rated on 1/2/2009.A nice deep brown with a slight reddish tint body, off white head that left plenty of lace. Flavor was a disappointment with mostly a metallic presence that dominated the other flavors. I guess this was a bad bottle, maybe i might try it again someday.
Dogfish Head Raison D'Etre;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Dogfish Head Brewery;Dark clear, brown / reddish pour with thick beige foam. Full body with less fizz and a thick, sweet finish. Dried fruit in the nose and caramel, nutty malts, burnt sugar. Some light bitterness, but this is all about the malt mingling with the fruit. The finish has a little yeast and alcohol. A strong, complex approach to a Belgian that would compliment a range of flavorful foods.

Dogfish Head Chicory Stout;Milton, Delaware, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dogfish Head Brewery;Had on April 3, 2019 from a bottle from 2007. Pours a very dark brown with a quickly evaporating khaki colored head. Sorghum and chicory on the nose. Moderately thick male feel. Drinks more dryly than the nose would suggest. Chicory earthiness and bitterness dominates the sorghum flavors.
Dogfish Head Chicory Stout;Milton, Delaware, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dogfish Head Brewery;From Aug 2007 I got this one in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks, John! Pours from 12oz bottle a very dark brown with reddish hues and a small but tight head of foam that shrinks to some islands and it has some good sticky lacing. The smell is of sweet malt, roasted malt, vanilla and wood. The taste is of caramel and roasted malt, some vanilla and woody notes. Further sips give me a bit of chocolate and a wee bit of fruit and sharp bitterness just before the finish and the finish itself is semi sweet. This is a good taster and easy to drink and it has a smooth mouthfeel and the carbo is light. All in all, a solid American Stout that should please most palates.
Dogfish Head Chicory Stout;Milton, Delaware, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dogfish Head Brewery;Backlog, bottle from Canals West Deptford. pours a dark brown color with a medium head and plenty of lasting lace on my glass.

Dogfish Head Chicory Stout;Milton, Delaware, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dogfish Head Brewery;12oz bottle. I just had to rate a DFH beer after all the anger about AB this week. Pours out dark brown almost black topped with a tan head. Nose is light chocolate some roast malts and a little hop bitterness. Taste is more like sadness as you can see my shity same old reviews are still mine and not a AB robot. Sure hope this blows over at some point but I am sure the scares are deep.

Dogfish Head Chicory Stout;Milton, Delaware, United States;Stout - Flavored;Dogfish Head Brewery;Rated from old notes. A workmanlike stout, rich, hints of chocolate and licorice. Served too cold at the time so some of the flavors were probably dulled. Definite candidate to re-rate.

Rodenbach Grand Cru;Roeselare, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Rodenbach (Swinkels Family Brewers);Really sour:)) teasty, but actually seems to me very simple, tastes like black bread, Russian “Kvas” like. Red Ale from Rodenbach much-much better:)

Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);On keg at Matlock Town FC - Thought I’d had this, a very familiar feel to it. Typically good looking nitrokeg look, amber body, solid white head. Nose is a sweet caramel, a bit of malt and the taste has a similar feel too. Nitro helps this have a good mouthfeel, smooth and creamy. Very refreshing for its style.

Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Two pints poured into UK pint sleeves at the Wellington cricket club bar on Sunday 9 Oct 2011 during a Christening party. Bright semi-dark amber body with a creamy foaming topping. This beer is cold when it comes out, it is also creamy, the nitrogen sees to both the temp and creaminess. No smell and the whole deal is weak, with only a slight bitterness in the taste. OK for none cask bitter men maybe, but not for me.
Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Keg at the Dudley Sports & Social Club. Pours orange with a medium head. Aroma is some orange and bready malt. Taste had a hint of orange and watery bready malt. Got better as it warmed.

Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);On keg in a Burtonwood pub in Yorkshire - can’t remember where or when (old notes). Ventured into a Burtonwood pub because W & D bought the pub group and the days of finding Burtonwood beers in pubs bearing their name may be numbered. Unfortunately only W & D beers were on offer. So I took the tick rather than drink a Banks’s beer I’d had before. Amber colour. Certainly smooth and creamy. Unfirtunately its entirely devoid of flavour. Except a rather metallic aftertaste. It could hardly be called horrible - it doesn’t have enough character for that - but I surely won’t be seeking this one out again.
Mansfield Smooth Creamy Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Keg at The Pepperpot, Banbury. Orange amber with masses of nitrogen, white head. Crikey Ratebeer has messed my drinking habits up, there was a perfectly acceptable Pedigree to be had, but I opted for this. Cardboard notes to the fore with a flat malt taste. The creaminess comes from a thick primeivel soup of nitrogen awaiting to be released from the freezing liqued. Me not like.

Not seen this beer for years, so thought I would have one for old times sake. Golden syrup coloured with a good, steady white head.

Mansfield Original Bitter;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Can from my local offy. Miserable fucking bitch in The Last Oasis, Macclesfield. I boycotted her right after this the nosy fat cow. Clear amber gold with thick soapy white head. Just like her. Dripping in shite gold, thick fat swede on her. I might have to rate it again in case her evilness seeped into the can. I doubt it. Low carbonation, malty, tea. Don’t like it. Never buy from that evil donkey faced old fish wife again.
Mansfield Original Bitter;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Nice smooth session bitter - good colour, nice head, fruity, nice malt but not overpowering.

Mansfield Original Bitter;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Can, Sainsbury’s, Kidlington, 31-10-06. Mmmhh difficult to think of many positives about this, I only picked it up because it had been split from a multipack and was cheap.

Mansfield Dark Smooth Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);18th July 2015: keg pint at The Robin Hood just outside Baslow, Derbyshire. Dark, deep brown with a red hue the head a thick creamy affair. Served very cold, so no smell for at least 5 minutes. Roasted/toasted malt aroma once it was allowed to have one, I already knew it would have a promise of a mini sweetness to come in the taste, which it did. The taste was dominated by the malts and as it’s name suggests it was smooth in nature. Not really a keg bitter man but this was a whole lot better than the pint of cask Pedigree I had before it in the pub.
Mansfield Dark Smooth Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);On tap at a hotel outside Mansfield. Deep brown colour colour with a tick cream head. Roasted malt aroma, but rather dull. Taste slightly sweet, but a touch of bitterness at the finish.

Mansfield Dark Smooth Ale;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);"A Mes rate: Ok I have to describe this scene. Sim and I were driving to my brothers house in deepest darkest Macclesfield. It’s lashing down with rain and we are both busting for the loo. Eventually we can go no further, pull up the car and run over the road getting soaked into the nearest pub. Before I knew it I was in the gents and Sim had disappeared down a corridor hopefully to find the ladies. All of a sudden it occurs to me that we have just run through the pub not saying anything and the place was TOTALLY empty and the only three people in there had given us such a stare when we ran in. So being the good chap that I am I decide to buy a beer (don’t be cheeky and not use the toilet without buying anything, small pub struggling for business etc....) I’m done before Sim so I go straight to the bar and order a swift one of this as I have never seen it before. The well poured and conditioned beer was on the bar straight away and there I am, on my own with the three people who were now at the bar. Oh one of them is the landlord behind the bar by the way. Sim returns from the loo and we sat there and shared the beer and rate it infront of them into my phone. They honestly barely spoke and if they did it was just grunting. Instead they spent their whole time looking at us and my phone. If you have ever seen ""Withnail and I"" (and if you havent, you should) it was just like the pub near the cottage where the poacher comes in and serves himself at the end of the night. We left and stoped just around the corner to pick up a chinese meal from what was the exact take away equivalent of the watering house up the street. Imagine how pleased I was to get home and find out the beer was retired and the last rating was well over two years ago. The beer was decent but what do you care, you can’t get it anymore. Long rate very sorry."

Nelson Hardy's Kiss;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;(cask @ The Coopers Arms , Rochester) A rich -malty sweet dark ale , that had some ’Old Ale’ character and tendancies . The ale drank down with notes of caramel and what felt like chcolate malt had been used. A little winey , fruity and bloody like old peculier or something. The palate , while treacly , did offer some late light musty dryness. Full bodied ale that feels more boozy than 4% . Drinkable and somehow comforting
Nelson Hardy's Kiss;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask handpull at Simple Simons, Canterbury. Amber with lasting beige head. Yeasty, malty, fruity best bitter.

Nelson Hardy's Kiss;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Good solid beer this, the very first at the Lock last Friday. Lovely amber coloured body with as white head. Hoppy with moderate bitterness, the malts play a secondary role in what is best described as a full classic bitter. Initially there was some confusion, SilkT et al, thought that this beer was Harvey’s – Kiss Ale but my notes didn’t say that. Committed as I am to rating quality, I returned to the Wenlock on the Saturday to double check with Dave. Flagship (Nelson Brewery) is what it was. Just to make doubly sure of everything I fronted up on the Sunday as well…..to find the absolute gem, Adnams Oyster Stout, just out of retirement. Wow!!
Nelson Hardy's Kiss;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;April, 2003: Three Daws, Gravesend. Sweet malt dominates - a mollases taste which coats the roof of your mouth. Hops are in the background. [2.4] March, 2004: The Rising Sun, Kemsing. Badged as Hardy’s Kiss. Amber bitter. Fresh on, but a bit cloudy. Fruity notes with just enough bittering hops to provide a neutral palate. A restrained and undeveloped beer that somehow manages to produce some oaky character, plus some brown sugar and watery caramel flavours. Undeveloped malt aroma. Nelson’s yeast seems a slow acting yeast which does not fully attenuate resulting in an interesting oaked malt quality which sadly does not quite suit my palate. [2.1 Feb, 2005: Three Daws, Gravesend. Light orange flavours. Drier and more gulpable than on previous samples. Enjoyable. [2.7]

Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"Bottle. Very smooth, malty lager. Definitely sweet. Clean finish. Very well finished with no off-flavors. Many of the current IPA microbeers have a punchy, hoppy hook. They create a ""wow"" at the tasting, but they quickly fatigue the palate, and are ultimately not a drinking beer. This one is the opposite: unassuming at first, but so smooth and drinkable. Extremely well finished, and one of my new favorites!"

Nelson Crows Nest;Chatham, Kent, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask Conditioned, at The Frog & Todd, Gillingham. Bright as can be, golden honey colour, charming. Strong volatile aroma, that dominates the entire experience. Alcohol, perhaps paint thinner, permeates this beer. A fight with one of the looks was narrowly avoided as I quickly explained we were not beer wankers but just two guys doing our job, sure I said ‘you can make a living our of drinking beer, but some days it just hard work’ the guy loved us from that point on. The second funny thing was that the brewer walked in whilst we were drinking this, Silk quickly collars him about the poor quality, that was a mistake….I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone say so much which meant so little, including some of the greatest politicians. Part of the life threatening SilkTork Gillingham Magical Mystery Tour.

[1.9] April, 2004: Frog & Toad, Gillingham. Orange-gold possibly premium bitter. Served slightly warm. Pale malt aroma. Fruit with a late hop bite. Chrissie finished this. Good girl. [1.9]

Great Lakes Holy Moses White Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On tap at The Old Town Pour House in Oak Brook, IL., dispensed to a tulip displaying a hazed, golden color, a persistent finger's width of soft white froth, with wavy spots & strands of lacing. The nose needed a bit of warming to expose soft grain/wheat, light fruitiness as lemon, pit variety, and orange peel, with subtle spice, mainly coriander. Light to medium bodied, with lively carbonation, the taste was similar notes, with some tartness & tanginess, a touch of earthy & rind-like bitterness, and dryness to the finish. Not too spiced or sweet. A decent style representation.

Great Lakes Holy Moses White Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);12 oz bottle pours a hazy golden color with medium white head. There's almost nothing to smell. Aroma is faint and wheaty. Flavor is dominated by coriander, over a base of floral hops. Taste is slightly bitter. Body is light to medium with average carbonation. A decent witbier, but not one I'll seek out again. This is the only Great Lakes brew that has disappointed me.
Nelson Spanker;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Sampled at the red cow, Sandwich. No head and a clear brown color. Small aroma of an ocean beach with sea weed. Light acidic ( lactic) taste that over powers malt and hops. Medium body and a low bitterness.
Nelson Spanker;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;"July 2017 - Cask handpull at The Crosse Keys London on a warm day in London after crushing my new iPhone under weights at the gym. As ’Nelson Spanker’, 4.2%. Dark amber brown with an orange hue, still with a very small ring of head. Aroma is light bready malt and apple peel. Smells a bit dodgy. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is watery with some Brighton rock sweetness, ""candy cane"", light red apple, very light malt, minerally, subtle floral hops. Not much to it but it’s a subtle old school bitter in good condition with malt, water, yeast and hop nuance all in tandem. The flavour is actually pretty good, well balanced. Could drink a few pints of it. (5-4-7-3-14=3.3)"

Nelson Spanker;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask handpull at County Hotel, JDW, Ashford. Copper colour with lasting beige head. Rather a lovely biscuity bitter.

Nelson Spanker;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;1/2 pint cask, Cloisters. Deep reddish golden colour and a creamy medium-sized off-white head that seems like it wants to disintegrate. Nutty rich malty aroma without being sweet. Prickly toffee-like malty flavour with a crisp minty bite. Mouthfeel is slightly acidic with a crisp hop bitterness. Interesting use of malts. It is quite unlike the other cask ales I’ve had the last few days. Smooth texture. I suspect there to be some oxisation introduced during the brewing process.
