Bitter End Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Ahhhh, the pilsener. Does it have one ""e"" or two? So I''m sitting at the bar at this brewpub, waiting for my wingman to get there. On at least three times over 20 minutes, I heard someone come up and ask for a budcoorsmiller Lite. When told that they brew their own beers, they would just ask for ""The lightest thing you got"". I mean, are they *trying* to drink bad beer? This is maybe a little above average for a brewpub pils...slightly skunky, fruity, blah finish. Not as fun as screwing your ex, especially when they''re serving the rye atout at the same time."

Haerlemsch Old-Ale;Haarlem, Netherlands;Old Ale;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;Quite a yeasty nose, sweet caramelly start. Yeasty finish, with a lot of alcohol showing. Some appley, plummy fruit, but too sweet and too much alcohol for me. (bottle GBBF 03')
Haerlemsch Old-Ale;Haarlem, Netherlands;Old Ale;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;My last purchase of the GBBF, and as the festival was closing down this was the last bottle to open and share. Deep dark head--as dark as I've ever seen?--and a deep, rich, stout-like aroma. I pick up a fruity aroma as I drink it, and then get some musty flavors. Flavors of alcohol and plums come through but there is a sharp edge to it as well. Interesting and enjoyable beer. (bottle at GBBF 2003)

McMenamins Shinty Export Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Scottish Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;A pacific northwest style scottish ale a bit hoppier than Bert Grants Scottish Ale. Bronze amber carrying a crisp head the aroma was a subtle scotch barrel malt and hops. Excellent interplay of malt and hop in the flavor--though hops do prevail. Springy and lambent beer that is a good refreshment.
McMenamins Sunnybrook Wheat;Portland, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On tap at the Sunnyside Mcmenamins. Pours very light yellow/gold, very clear with a faint fast falling white head. Very light wheat in the aroma mixed with a subtle hop blend, nothing really stood out, and a touch of fruity yeast esters showed up for a bit. Taste was very watery and bland with veyr mild wheat, no spicing, and a light hop finish. Very mild american wheat beer.

McMenamins Sunnybrook Wheat;Portland, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Blonde with a crisp head and light hoppiness in te aroma. The wheat flavor is present, but clean and reserved making way for hops. A well balanced wheat--akin to an APA and one that I would appreciate more if I had enjoyed this in the summer.

Keiler Urtyp 1878;Lohr am Main, Bavaria, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Keiler Bier (WÃ¼rzburger HofbrÃ¤u);Bottle from IxI GetrÃ¤nkemarkt in Frankfurt.

Keiler Urtyp 1878;Lohr am Main, Bavaria, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Keiler Bier (WÃ¼rzburger HofbrÃ¤u);"500ml bottle bought at Great Food Hall in Pacific Place, Admiralty. Clear deep amber brown colour; Three-quarter finger head and off-white foam which fades in 40 seconds; Moderate sticky lacing with fizzy carbonation; Light aroma of malt, with caramel, light musty, dark bread, faint lemon and strong grass; Very light sweet taste of full malt, with light caramel, light molasses, dark bread, yeast, light lemon and very light grass; Light body, watery and slightly slick palate; Mouth feel is watery thin but quite malty amber lager, with some notable notes of caramel and molasses. Tasteof dark bread and yeasty. Hmmmâ€¦. Hoppiness is very grassy nose, faint lemony grassy hops in taste. Minimal bitterness, just malty dark bread finish; Fairly dry after taste, very easy to mouth. Comments: This one has the traditional dark colour of Maerzen, but other than that, its weak body which affected the maltyness, and lack of hoppiness are real downer. Feels like a malty macro Amber Lager. As a Maerzen, it doesnâ€™t work. Disappointing."
Keiler Urtyp 1878;Lohr am Main, Bavaria, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Keiler Bier (WÃ¼rzburger HofbrÃ¤u);Bottle from Germany thanks to a friend: Pours a dark autumn orange topped with a short lived foam cap head. Aroma is tame and only allows for a slight whiff of caramelized malts and cereal grains. The beer drinks smooth across my palate with some heavy carbonation bubbles. As for the taste, there isnâ€™t much happening other than a medium-bodied Oktoberfest with hints of caramelized malts. The finish has a bitter taste while also leaving behind a taste of sour residue around my lips.
Keiler Urtyp 1878;Lohr am Main, Bavaria, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Keiler Bier (WÃ¼rzburger HofbrÃ¤u);Serving: from bottle--purchased at AllendÃ¶rfer. Aroma: lightly malty. Appearance: average-sized, frothy, off-white, initial head with no lacing and fully diminishing longevity. Clear, dark-amber body. Taste: lightly sour, lemony initial flavor and lightly sweet finish with short duration. Palate: light body, watery texture and soft-to-lively carbonation. Overall: very good. Great taste, easy to drink. I would gladly drink this again.
Keiler Urtyp 1878;Lohr am Main, Bavaria, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Keiler Bier (WÃ¼rzburger HofbrÃ¤u);Thanks to John for this one! 500 ml bottle into a pint glass. 5.2% indicated on bottle, and a 2009 best-by date. Ah well. A: Pours a darker amber color. Thereâ€™s also a lot of unattractive sediment in the pour, also. The head is a two finger white shade with a fairly bubbly yet creamy texture. S: Sweet - like a good dunkel, really. Notes of caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, banana, bubblegum, and wheat abound here. T: Interesting how Ratebeer calls it a marzen: Iâ€™d be more in tune to call it a dunkel. A sweet, caramel-forward opening is balanced somewhat by its crisp wheat finish. I even notice the slightest hint of hops - not bad for something that has to be 5 years old. Tones of musty cardboard indicate its age, though. Still, itâ€™s held up well. M: It has a decent body, with a wet lingering finish. A bit sweet and (perhaps) undercarbonated all told, but I can forgive that taking its age into consideration. O: Given how old it is, itâ€™s actually pretty good. Iâ€™d even seek out a fresh bottle, provided they exist.
Keiler Urtyp 1878;Lohr am Main, Bavaria, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Keiler Bier (WÃ¼rzburger HofbrÃ¤u);Brought home from Germany. Overall, a nice Marzen. A little weak on the scent, just some faint grain, but the pour was a beauty, copper with a bubbly white head. The mouthfeel was light and crisp, and the taste held a nice caramel hint over the grain. Well done.

Bitter End Pils;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Ahhhh, the pilsener. Does it have one ""e"" or two? So I''m sitting at the bar at this brewpub, waiting for my wingman to get there. On at least three times over 20 minutes, I heard someone come up and ask for a budcoorsmiller Lite. When told that they brew their own beers, they would just ask for ""The lightest thing you got"". I mean, are they *trying* to drink bad beer? This is maybe a little above average for a brewpub pils...slightly skunky, fruity, blah finish. Not as fun as screwing your ex, especially when they''re serving the rye atout at the same time."

Saint Arnould Muchacha;Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Microbrasserie Saint Arnould (Coop Brassicole des Laurentides);"Originally rated April 2005. Bought a six-pack of this at the ""Trappe Ã  Fromage"" in Gatineau, Quebec, containing five 341ml brown bottle and one Saint Arnould glass. This is really a micro, as the bottle caps are the generic you buy at the homebrew store and has that dent in it when you do it by hand. Looking forward to my first Saint Arnould experience. Pours a hazy yellow-white colour with a very white silky head, and foamy lacing. The nose is yeasty like a witbier, but nice and light. The carbonation is heavy and the taste is quite different at first, as it is very sour. The aftertaste then turns grainy and smooth. Interesting... a mixture of pale lager and witbier it seems to me. Worth a try !"

A solid but unspectacular pub ale. Orange-copper body with a very little white head. Typical Pale Ale, light caramel touch followed by a nice long hop bitterness after-taste. No funky spices or anything. I canâ€™t praise it for anything but I canâ€™t complain about anything either (besides the disappointingly small head). Good enough to justify a pit-stop on my way to the much superior Dieu Du Ciel.

RÃ©servoir Pale Ale (d'Ã‰tÃ©);MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;RÃ©servoir - Brasseur;I think this is probably the best beer they do, but that realy isnâ€™t saying much. Clearly an atempt to make a bass replica. Pours a slightly orange, crystal clear amber with a thin offwhite head that stays solid all throughout. Carbonation is a little high but not overly so, and there are some nice laceings. Aroma is sweet toffie and lemmony hops. The mouthfeel is slightly viscous with a creamy medium thick body. The taste is mostly earth and roast nut, with a nice grassy note. Some undertones of plumb, dry pine, and a tiny bitter splash. aftertaste is a spicy bitterness, with a tiny bit of grapefruit and a splash of spruce. Not bad, but canâ€™t compare to the pale ales of varios types at the other brewpubs in this city. Cheers

RÃ©servoir Pale Ale (d'Ã‰tÃ©);MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;RÃ©servoir - Brasseur;A charming shade of copper, with a compact head that stuck to the walls of my shaker pint. My first pint had a light, refreshing citrus hop aroma, with a herbal finish, the second one kinda smelled infected. How can that happen on the same keg? Decorous astringency, with a grapefruit aftertaste, but the middle felt a little too aqueous. Not enough malt profile for the style (and to my liking).

McCoys Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;McCoy's Public House;Shaker pint draft at the brewpub. Pour is a clear golden and ruby with not much of an off white head. Aroma is a touch metallic, than shows nice toasty malt, mildly sweet and herbal. Taste is the malt, honey sweet and toasty. The grass and herbal element kicks in half way and carries through to the finish. Palate is medium, coats the mouth a bit, lower carbonation.
McCoys Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;McCoy's Public House;On tap at McCoyâ€™s in KC. Pours a lightly clouded, deep red-orange-amber body with a frothy, finger-width, beige head that dissipates quickly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is some bready caramels with a light toast. A light nutty and fruity hop barely creeps in here too. Flavor is a moderately sweet, light caramel and toasty toffee with a small amount of resiny, fruity bitterness. The hops come out more than the malts at the end and give this a nice, drying, light leafy bitter finish. Medium length aftertaste of lightly sweetened caramels, a hint of toasty toffee, and an even bitter fruit flavor. Medium bodied with a bit of a crisp carbonation. Overall, not as malt forward and toasty as most Oktoberfests, but tasty and balanced. The hop profile makes this somewhat different, which I found enjoyable.

Very dark brown with just a hint of head, muddy/dirty looking....smoky, sweet, low-powered malty aroma, little to no hoppiness.....thick, sweet, a bit syrupy with tarry/burnt caramel malt dominating, the mouthfeel curiously too sticky at first but getting rather too dry and papery at the finish....like the other beers I sampled here itâ€™s the mouthfeel/finish that really undoes things.
McCoys Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;McCoy's Public House;Darker red, but still held onto some copper notes. Thin head but solid and lasting with an off white colour. The aroma was somewhat dull but held a bit of caramel, a bit of spice. The palate was a bit chewy and nice. Not sticky or creamy, or even heavy. Just a good feel in your mouth. The flavour was mostly caralmel like malt with some toast as well. The flavour is mostly sweet but still well balanced. Well done, not overly exciting but very very drinkable.
McCoys Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;McCoy's Public House;Absolutely gorgeous copper color. Otherwise an average Oktoberfest--somewhat malty, slightly sweet.
McCoys Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;McCoy's Public House;Malty aroma, lightly bready and toffeeish, with hints of hop spice (Hallertau?) and toasty barley. Medium copper-red color, with a lightly creamy, fine head. Caramel malt flavor, some brown sugar sweetness but nicely balanced by spicy hop bitterness, even some faint peppery notes at the end. Prickly finish. Good Fest style.
McCoys Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;McCoy's Public House;A very suprising offering from an average brew pub. Big beautiful biscuit like head topping off a sweet, malty, rich amber colored body. A well balanced Oktoberfest that can rival Goose Island and many other better known breweries.

Laurelwood Organic Free Range Red;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);Ha! Canâ€™t recall how many times Iâ€™ve had this and yet havenâ€™t rated it til now. Colour...deep, clear amber with a corpulent off white head. Nose...pretty hoppy for an amber, with hints of biscuits and spent grain. Palate...crisp and slightly sweet, but definitely hoppy. In fact this is likely the hoppiest amber I ever had!

Laurelwood Organic Free Range Red;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);12oz bottle from a six pack that was gifted to me. Unfortunately, I always steer clear of hoppy and malt beers that have a penchant for caramel flavors. Hey, guess what, this is exactly that and I really donâ€™t like that flavor combo. Who does? Who do I give the rest of these beers.

High Noon Roundup Rye;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;Spicy, malty and rye aroma. Medium golden in color with a hint of amber. Good draft-style carbonation and head. Flavor is more sweet and light than the aroma or style would indicate initially. Light grain moving to a slightly honeyed finish, not much bitterness to be found here nor there. Boo for that. Not much going on here.
High Noon Samuel Colt Kolsch;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;Pale golden color. Faint carbonation and head, surprisingly. Dryish malt aroma. Flavor is very bready, grainy and malty. Not a lot of sweetness here and just a little bitterness. Not too flavorful, but not offensive. I thought I detected some wheat malt a time or two, somehow.
High Noon Wee Willies Kilt Lifter;Leavenworth, Kansas, United States;Scottish Ale;High Noon Saloon & Brewery;I was looking forward to trying this glass of Scottish-style ale, it looked really nice in the glass, all deep red, nice off-white head and promising maltiness. When I appraised the aroma, though, I knew I was not in for a treat. Aroma is faint, lightly fruity with some toffee. The malt flavor is very lightly smoky and vinous but is anything but assertive. Not much hop to speak of, either. Light and watery on the palate. Dang.

Bitter Root Nut Brown Ale;Hamilton, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Bitter Root Brewing;Draft pour. The beer is a clear brown with a beige head of foam. The beer has a fairly muted aroma. Taste has more roasty aspects and bitter dark chocolate. Medium body and medium carbonation.
Bitter Root Nut Brown Ale;Hamilton, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Bitter Root Brewing;Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance â€“ The beer pours a dark brown color with a one finger head of cream colored foam. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a moderate level of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell â€“ The aroma of the beer is rather sweet with the biggest aromas being a mix of toffee and caramel. Along with these smells comes some more roasted malt smell and a nice hazelnut like smell. A little bit of chocolate is there is well, complimenting the sweet, roasted and nut nicely. Taste â€“ The taste begins with a sweeter flavor of caramel with a hint of toffee as well as a decently strong showing of a roasted malt taste. Right from the start there is a nice nutty flavor that grows stronger as the taste moves on forward. All the while the roasted tastes initially grow stronger in flavor and then end up later fading. With a little bit of earth and more caramel developing at the end, one is left with a smooth and sweet roasted nutty taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel â€“ The body of the beer is on the somewhat thinner side with a carbonation level that is on the average to slightly higher side. A little thicker body and a lower carbonation level may have been slightly more appropriate for the nut and roasted flavors of the brew, but overall the feel wasnâ€™t too bad as it did make for an easy drinking feel. Overall â€“ A somewhat sweeter and nicely nutted brown ale that was rather easy drinking. Rather enjoyable overall.
Bitter Root Nut Brown Ale;Hamilton, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Bitter Root Brewing;Poured from 22 oz bottle. Pours a rich brown 1 finger head. Aroma malt, chocolate, coffee, subtle hops. Taste follows same way. A little more coffee than I expect from nut brown.

O'Fallon Smoked Porter;Maryland Heights, Missouri, United States;Porter - Smoked;O'Fallon Brewery;Nice smoked porter. This beer is all about the smoked flavor. From the very first sip to the very end the smoked flavor is there. Dark fruits with some chocolate form the body of the beer. But it is the smoked flavor that reigns over everything else. Best smoked beer for sure!

Drinking and making an opinion about this beer, at home, at Epalinges, during the meal. The color is black, opaque, thin white and brown foam, regular carbonation for the style.

Just doesn''t fit my idea of an Octoberfest, more like a dry undermalted IPA. Pass."

Ottos Black Mo Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Otto's Pub and Brewery;"Transfer from BA reviewed 1-19-12 - Had on tap at the brew pub served in a pint glass. Appearance â€“ The black as night nitro driven beer forms a beautiful white head which cascades through the dark brew giving a nice, just off white, foam head with very nice retention. A thing of beauty in a beer. Smell â€“ Roasted malts and dark chocolate are the first to be encountered. While the two dominate the nose, a faint bit of sweetness works its way at the end. Taste â€“ The flavor of roasted malts give a nice very nutty-toasty taste. The cocoa flavor then develops shortly after, complementing the roasted notes very nicely. The nutty, toasty malt with chocolate overtones then sweetens ever so slightly toward the end of the tasting, with hints of vanilla swirled into the other more dominant flavors. A very nice balance. Nothing overpowers too much, but the important flavors shine at just the right time. Mouthfeel â€“ Creamy to say the least. The perfectly formulated nitro driven body combined with the wonderfully balanced and non overpowering lighter malt body makes for a very smooth drinking experience. So wonderfully smooth, light and refreshing; the silk of the beer world. Overall â€“ This is one great beer. I have tasted this many times before and every time I have it I am surprised at how wonderfully creamy, tasty, light and satisfying it is. For anyone out there this is a must try."

Ottos Oktoberfest;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Otto's Pub and Brewery;A solid well-balanced Octoberfest - clear orange color, malt sweetness just barely balanced out by some faint European hop backbone.

Ottos Oktoberfest;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Otto's Pub and Brewery;"Transfer from BA review on 9-30-12- Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance â€“ Served an amber colored beer with a slight orange-red hint. Upon serving there was almost no head at all. With almost no head, there was really no lacing at all either. Smell â€“ The aroma of the beer was a nice blend of sweet caramel and toffee mixed with roasted malt and a very light fruit aroma. With these aromas, is a very light spice aroma which rounds out the aroma of the brew quite nicely. Taste - The taste begins with a flavor of caramel and some roasted malt. As the taste advances through the middle to the end it dries then sweetens up again. In the middle the taste dries as more roasted, light spice, and a very light nuttiness comes to the tongue. While these dry out the beer, it is only temporary. At the end of the taste the sweet strikes back; a caramel and toffee flavor come to the tongue and when combined with the roast leave a very pleasantly sweet roasted flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel â€“ The body and the carbonation of the beer were both rather average. Both were nice for the style as they made for an easy drinking and refreshing beer without compromising any of the flavors by being over carbonated and light. Overall â€“ This beer, in my opinion, is a very nice example of a Oktoberfest. It has great flavors, is very drinkable and smells wonderful. Besides its lack of a great look (due to lack of head) it is a fantastic brew."
Ottos Oktoberfest;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Otto's Pub and Brewery;The beer appears average with a clear orange hue, a one finger white head, and decent lacing on the glass. The beer smells average as it has a mild malty/caramel blended nose. The beer tastes great as you get a decent malty flavor that is followed by a toffee/caramel finish, very strong flavors as opposed to the nose. The mouthfeel is decent as the beer is well carbonated and leaves you somewhat dry. Overall, the smell lacked and the taste didnâ€™t...not a bad marzen.
Ottos Oktoberfest;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Otto's Pub and Brewery;One of the better marzens Iâ€™ve had over the years. Nice amount of sweet caramel malts. A lager that I would order more than one of is saying something, and this is one of them.

Aroma is a light malt sweetness with some grains and a bit of a bland fruit. Flavor is better. Somewhat grainy, lightly toasted malts with a touch of toffee-bread sweetness. Very light earthy hopping comes in to balance with a light fruit as well. Finishes clean and mostly dry with a very light bitterness before leaving a medium length aftertaste. Medium-light body and a soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, an alright Oktoberfest. Nothing special, but easy drinking and well balanced.

Taste half-smooth and half-crisp, medium-full body not overly malty but nicely struck with a bit of bread in the finish. The apricot experience is much nicer in the mouth that at times it more resembles bramble berries than stone fruit. Clean and quenching, maybe a touch too sweet for two or three, but possibly correctable by mixing with seltzer. Absolutely worth going out and getting. [2018.07.10: 3.2]
Ottos Apricot Wheat;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Poured into a nonic pint glass, the appearance was a semi-hazy copper/amber color with a little white head that swiftly dissipated. No lace. The aroma had sweet apricots up front, light grassy hops at the end, not much else. The flavor was the sweet apricots with a sweet apricot aftertaste and finish. The feel was light bodied with a decent carbonation and ABV. Overall, I think I got enough words in for this so called review, but I didnâ€™t get any wheat. Decent for what Ottoâ€™s wanted to do. But I will have to disagree and say this is more of Spring/Summer beer, I wouldnâ€™t want this in the dead of Winter. Iâ€™ll stick to my big stouts in the Winter.
Ottos Apricot Wheat;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Aroma and taste is very much apricot. Unfortunately, thatâ€™s not a taste I enjoy.

Ottos Apricot Wheat;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;12oz bottle pours a clear orange with some cloudy, white head.

Ottos Apricot Wheat;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Apricot aroma. Hazy amber, thin head. Apricot dominated flavor. Light body. Tasty, but singularly fruited. Should be re-classed as a fruit beer.
Ottos Helles Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Otto's Pub and Brewery;"Draft at KClingers. Bronze color makes me wonder if I got the right beer. Light hoppy aroma; drinks with an even malt keel. Drinkable. (#3911, 5/23/2010)"
Ottos Helles Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Rated 9/15/07 - Draft Sample at brewpub. Light golden color with small white head. Sweet, normal malty lager taste. A bit muddled finish, hoppy and lingering. not bad.
Ottos Helles Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Aroma, what aroma? A plain weak malt falters into the room, barely noticed. Pours a polished bronze, golden in hue, rimmed in white. Flavor is even less descriptive than the aroma, thereâ€™s a palatable seltzer water quality and a particular derision of light corn, but mostly a bland malt figure, with nips of old lemon, salty grain and sweet honey. Body runs somewhere between thin and full. Maybe satisfying, but somehow not thirst quenching. Finishes dry with maybe a little bit of grain crispness. Totally forgettable. Seems a shame to waste this style as the BMC look a like.
Ottos Helles Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub on 4/9/07: Pours a transparent bright golden with a thin, frothy white head. Aroma of slightly sweet pale grainy malt and a touch of floral noble hops. Body starts lightly malty turning more bitter and thinner toward a crisp finish. True to style and drinkable.

Ottos Helles Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Re-Rate. Tap at the brewpub. Poured into an imperial pint glass- nice clear gold with lively carbonation, a nice lasting fluffy head and some nice lacing. Aroma is grainy, fresh pils malt, bready, lightly sweet and very light herbal german hops. Nice slightly sweet, with a dryish grainy flavor with more bready fresh pils malt, and a nice crisp quenching finish. This was a lot better than the first time I had sampled this at the brewpub a couple years ago.
Ottos Helles Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a medium golden color with a small white head. The aroma is light sour malts with a hint of floral hops. The flavor is your typical sour tangy lager with a hint of dry nut on the finish. Fairly basic.
Ottos Helles Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Draught at the brewery. Clear solid yellow color, a bit darker than most, with light trails of bubbles rising quickly through the body, with a thin white head. Light, syrupy flavors of corn and hay, with a moderately peppery nose. Simple tasting overall, crisp and refreshing, but still simply made.
Ottos Helles Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Clear yellow-straw body with moderate visible carbonation and a loose, sudsy white head. Aroma is fresh with pleasantly buttery malt qualities plus floral and honey notes. Good malt character in the flavor with light residual sweetness and some lightly crisp, developing bitterness. A nice, clean helles after a long drive.
Ottos Helles Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Draft. Decent aroma, light hoppy appeal. Light lager color with minimal head. Flavor is smooth with very little bitterness. Very drinkable and one that goes well with all of the food at Ottoâ€™s especially the hadok.
Middle Ages White Knight Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;From old tasting notes. Hazy amber orange color topped by a rocky beige head. Spicy malt nose. Crisp dry malt flavor balanced by a bitter hop finish. Lacks depth.
Middle Ages White Knight Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;You know... Iâ€™m not sure if this beer is labeled right based on other reviews. It definitely is called this... but this review will be a lot different than a few Iâ€™ve read. First of all... MY GOD. The cap was capped so tightly that the bottle FREAKING BROKE. This brewery has already killed one of my openers, and luckily this one wasnâ€™t gonna break. After I carefully poured it and avoided glass shards it gave a cloudy dark amber body with a small head. Didnâ€™t seem much like a light ale to me. The beer itself was fairly one dimensional, but certainly enjoyable. Big vanilla aroma. Flavor was the same. Maybe some hints of lighter fruits in there. Really... Iâ€™m totally baffled by this one. It wasnâ€™t that light bodied. It certainly wasnâ€™t golden or blonde in color. Perhaps they changed what they put in this because most of the previous reviews say this beer sucks. In this case Iâ€™m more confident itâ€™s a different beer than me losing my mind. Usually itâ€™s the other way around.
Middle Ages White Knight Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;"Clear golden colour with a thinnish white head. Aroma of subtle American hops with some rice & sugar and nothing else. Light-bodied (as expected); Mild hop flavour with some sweetness & not much else. Aftertaste bland and not pleasant at all. Overall, horrible-but I wanted to try another inferior beer from this brewery, because I was leaving from New York a week later. I sampled this 12 ounce bottle purchased from Premier Gourmet in Buffalo, New York on 30-July-2004 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia."
Middle Ages White Knight Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Golden ale with a maple syrup aroma. Dry in mouth. Fresh malt and maple sweet tatse. Lighter bodied.
Middle Ages White Knight Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Cask: Had this at the Old Toad, Rochester. Mostly clear, blonde yellow color with a minimal white head that disappears. Thereâ€™s almost no aroma coming from this beer albeit some light malt and floral notes. As much as I love ales on cask, it just doesnâ€™t do anything for this beer. Simply put, itâ€™s bland. Thereâ€™s nothing offensive in the taste whatsoever, but thereâ€™s nothing really great there either. Some very mild hops, light malt characteristics, light carbonation, and a watery mouth feel. Inoffensive is about all I can say. Why would they bother putting a light ale on cask? Hmm.
Middle Ages White Knight Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;"On tap at Middle Ages Brewery, Syracuse NY: This tastes like a cream ale/blond ale hybrid with no redeeming quality of either.; cabbage/corn aroma, weak flavor, and generally unappealing."
Middle Ages White Knight Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Pours a hazy blonde color with little to no head, and what head there is is gone fast. I can't really smell anything. High carbonation, mild hoppiness, maybe a little fruitiness from the hops. A decent light beer, I mean there is a little flavor at least.
Middle Ages White Knight Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Pours slightly hazy blonde with a minimal quickly dissipating white head. Aroma is very faint--maybe some mild maltiness. Start and middle are massively carbonated to the point where you have trouble tasting anything. Finish has a nice little hop kick to it. Pretty good for a light beer. Was much better than I expected.
Middle Ages White Knight Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;"This one looks like some kind of old-person fiber-boosting drink to keep you ""regular"". The aroma was slightly malty with a light malty taste."
Middle Ages White Knight Light Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Orange in color with a small white head.Hoppy,floral,yeasty aroma with a bitter finish.
Turonis Blue Eyed Moose IPA;Evansville, Indiana, United States;IPA;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;Interesting that the description says malty as I am not a fan of malty IPA's. Does not have that strong of a malt aroma or taste. Very smooth. Will definitely get again. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Turonis Blue Eyed Moose IPA;Evansville, Indiana, United States;IPA;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;Orange pour with creamy off white head and lace. Caramel malt and citrus hops on the nose.

Turonis Blue Eyed Moose IPA;Evansville, Indiana, United States;IPA;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;tap at the brewpub - Grapefruit hop character dominates the aroma of this IPA. The flavor is of sweet malt with a hint of caramel up front and some good citrus accented bitterness. Itâ€™s medium bodied and pretty tasty.
Turonis Blue Eyed Moose IPA;Evansville, Indiana, United States;IPA;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;Got some dinner at Turoniâ€™s staying at a nearby hotel on our roadtrip. IPA was served in a pint glass, copper-amber color with off-white head. Aroma of floral/earthy hops and caramel malt. Taste leans more light citrus hops balancing well with the caramel malt. Medium body, average carbonation, light hoppiness with slight bitter aftertaste. I wish it has been a little more hoppy but very drinkable and enjoyable.
Turonis Blue Eyed Moose IPA;Evansville, Indiana, United States;IPA;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;Actually, this is a pretty good IPA. I really prefer more of a citrus hoppiness but all things considered, itâ€™s very drinkable. I always make sure I have a growler on hand to get filled when I pass by the Newburgh, IN location.
Turonis Blue Eyed Moose IPA;Evansville, Indiana, United States;IPA;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;Draught. Pours dark amber with a good sized soapy off-white head that leaves a sheath of lacing down the glass. Sweet floral aroma with a crystal malt extract xharacter. Flavor is quite sweet and malty with less bitterness than would be expected.
Turonis Blue Eyed Moose IPA;Evansville, Indiana, United States;IPA;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;Draught at brewpub/pizza place. Slight malt build. Some ok hops and aroma. Drinkable if not very impressive.
Turonis Blue Eyed Moose IPA;Evansville, Indiana, United States;IPA;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;Tap and served too cold: Coppery hue with a fading frothy head. The aroma has notes of citric and grassy hops, caramel and toasty malts, some grainy pale malts, and mineral water. The taste is a bit twangy and mild sweet malts with lead to a nutty and house yeast characteristic. There is a medicinal note that is a bit off putting. The mouth feel is soft yet biting. A okay beer with pizza but not as hoppy as I would have liked, the hops did appear a bit more as it warmed.
Best Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Not the best. Sticky artificial sweetness. Light and crisp bitterness. Tried with Laurens, Paul, and Dave before the Rye-union in 2019.
Best Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Moutig met een licht zoetje en een redelijke bitter. Ruikt moutig, drinkt lekker door en ziet er gewoon goed uit voor een pilsje. Doorzichtig geel met genoeg schuim. Eerlijk gezegd had ik met zo'n foute naam en vreselijk lelijk logo een slechter biertje verwacht. Maar deze is gewoon oke voor pils Proefglas

Best Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);From a 0,33 cl bottle. Clear yellow without Smallingerland head. Easy to drink beer. Exactly what you would expect from a cheap supermarket beer, but not bad.
Best Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Straight from the can. Some sweet malts, bread, light fake honey. Weird light bitter finish. Cheap macro lager but drinkable just like the rest.
Best Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Can. This really, really is not the best bier, actually more like some of the worst beers. Sweet and malty, nothing else. They even used maltose, which is a very bad sign. Yak.
Best Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Lichtgeel bier met schuim. Smaak is vlak en weinig bijzonder. Gewoon supermarkt bier.
Best Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Can: Served in a shaker: Medium sized fluffy white foamy head on top of a clear lighter yellow colored beer. Aromas of malts, pils malts, light wood, some oat, some cardboard and herbs. Flavours are quite low: some malts, herbs, mineral, bitters, grains, pils malts, light cardboard and some very light woody tones. Aftertaste is even lighter, some malts, light bitter, some herbs... Low carbo, creamy mouthfeel, low bodied and a watery to light creamy mouthfeel. Meh...
Best Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Some supermarket in Rotterdam: Pours golden yellow with a fizzy white head. Aroma is grainy, grassy, and cheap. Taste is slightly sweet, a tad hoppy, but mostly cheap and grainy. For a cheap-o beer with a funny label, this isnâ€™t bad.
Bristol Edge City Pilsner;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bristol Brewing Company;(2008)This was a very tasty pilsner. It was light and refreshing. This would be a great beer on a nice hot summer day. I would definitely buy this beer again.

Color is a bright yellow/gold with good carbonation and thin head. Taste is clean and bitter. Starting with a light body it goes down with a crisp feel. Finish comes on with a smooth malt flavor backed by a faint hop flavor and a bold bitter end. This may be one of the best and most well rounded Pilsners I have ever had.
Bristol Edge City Pilsner;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bristol Brewing Company;On tap at Bristol Brewsing. A light yellow color with foamy white head. Slightly bitter hoppy nose. Grainy body. Surprisingly good for a pils.
Bristol Edge City Pilsner;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bristol Brewing Company;Great micro pilsner - very refreshing taste and worth the trip to the brewery. Also served at Sky Sox games.
Bristol Edge City Pilsner;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bristol Brewing Company;"The whole collection of Bristol brews that are only available (and drinkable) at the Bristol brewpub is the biggest secret in Colorado Springs, second only to NORAD, and everybody at least knows NORAD is there. So I like to pop in to the brewery every once and awhile and see whatâ€™s on tap. Last time it was Skull & Bones, and making the typical naÃ¯ve college assumption I expected it this time around too. No such luck Iâ€™m afraid, but they did have two others of mild interest: Edge City Wit and Edge City Pilsner. The Pilsner was actually purchased by my friend, but we had something of a sampler session. I continue to stand by my love for Winter Warlock - and little else of Bristolâ€™s. The Pilsner was a fairly regular pilsner and lacked the charm that instills most of Bristolâ€™s beverages, even though they may not be the most complex or spirited. It sat upright in its glass like a bubbly column of neon yellow; an inch thick cap of alpine white crested on the top making a foam moustache free sip impossible. A thorough search with all two of my nostrils yielded no discernible scent. I may attribute this to the open, sterile and crowded nature of the bar. I may also attribute it to the veritable foam cork that plugged the top of the beer. The taste was pretty clear â€“ not watery. It bubbled and trickled with a very feint pilsner taste, tinged with a light skunkiness and left bereft of anything that could make it a strong pils. While not burdensome, itâ€™s not enlightening and lacked any character that would make it a beer eminent in my memory. If you ever visit the Brewpub Iâ€™d recommend having something else poured â€“ especially as this winter gives us such a wonderful sweet stout benison poured under the guise of a green-faced magician."
Bristol Edge City Pilsner;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bristol Brewing Company;Bomber {Thanks to BeerandBlues2} poured a hazy gold with a small quickly dissapating white head.

Big Horse Pale Rider IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Big Horse Brewing;A dry and very Columbus oriented green-tea/marijuana nose. Crisp with a tight and light carbonation. A light kiwi flavour and acidity with a slow bitterness. The carbonation reminds me Kronenburg 1664 and I donâ€™t mean that as an insult, it just does. I think itâ€™s nice, the bitterness builds a little too intensely and that weedy flavour could become too much if I bought more than a glass.

Big Horse Horse Tail Pale Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horse Brewing;A very boring pale ale, like most of the beers I tried at this brewery. Well balanced, but that is about it, very little malt background, light, bodied, with some crispy hoppiness.
Big Horse Horse Tail Pale Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horse Brewing;(Draft: Big Horse Brew Pub in Hood River, OR) On my brewery tour of Oregon, itâ€™s been awhile since Iâ€™ve had a quality American Pale Ale, but this is a very fine one. Mild, lightly sweet, and slightly grain malt base allows the tasty, lightly citrusy, moderately bitter hops to shine without stomping the taste buds. The subdued, but balanced nose is lightly malty and pleasantly hoppy. Golden color is fairly cloudy in appearance. Light-to-medium bodied, clean, with a crisp finish. The off-white head rises to half an inch, and as it slowly settles to a film, it leaves a few streaks of lace on the glass. A well-crafted, perfectly balanced APA that doesnâ€™t try to be an IPA, but would make a great session beer for me. Solid.
Big Horse Horse Tail Pale Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horse Brewing;Tap. LIghtly opaque, medium amber in color.

SNAB IJsbok;Purmerend, Netherlands;Bock - Eisbock;SNAB;Uiterlijk: Donkerbruin met een creme kleurige schuimkraag. Geur: Moutig, curacaoschil, koriander, speculaasjes en cacao. Smaak: Vol en romig, chocolademout, sinaasappel, aangename bitter, koriander. Mond, weinig koolzuur, volle smaak die erg aantrekkelijk is. Dit is een rating van een aantal jaren geleden, Ik heb het bier afgelopen winter ook nog een keer gedronken toen het in 37,5 cl. fles zat en deze vond ik een nasmaak hebben van gebrande suiker en plastic, maar over het algemeen goed te doen. Prima bewaarbier trouwens.

SNAB Czaar Peter;Purmerend, Netherlands;Stout - Imperial;SNAB;Een vrijwel zwarte substantie dat op het eerste gezicht wel wat meer boby mocht hebben. Geur en smaak doen allebei ongeveer hetzelfde aan: koffie, mokka, chocolade, in de smaak zit ook nog iets van rozijnen en karamel, maar ik had er op Ã©Ã©n of andere manier toch meer van verwacht. Motorolie.

SNAB Czaar Peter;Purmerend, Netherlands;Stout - Imperial;SNAB;"15-04-2018; bottle; at home (bought somewhere in The Netherlands). The looks of the beer are good. They are the looks of a great Russian Imperial Stout. It is only a tin lighter than most RIS. The beer is a very dark ruby red/brown, approaching black, but it is clearly that it isn't black whereas most RIS look black. In the light there is a nice ruby red glow. On top of the beer a nice layer of greyish brown, soft, fast collapsing foam is formed. After while hardly a drape is left. The smell isn't like I expected...it isn't a bad smell, but it isn't a RIS smell. I smell sweet malts, with only in a far, far away distance some coffee and chocolate. Way to less for a RIS. Hops give a slight herbal note. Yeast gives a creamy sensation, with some spicy notes and a little fruity banana note...reminding me a lot of Belgian Ale yeast. I expected more. The same can be said about the taste. It is rather weak and more of a Belgian Strong Ale taste than that of a RIS. There are sweet malts, with bitter herbal hops and creamy, spicy and fruity sweet yeast. The yeast profile is typical for a Belgian Strong Ale. I hardly taste the chocolate of the roasted malts. Alcohol is clearly present though. Flavour is balanced, but a bit weak and not style specific at all. The palate is fine. Medium body, smooth and high carbonation. The finish of the beer is filled with alcohol and some malty notes with a herbal hop edge. It is a bit dry and not very long. I expected a lot more from this beer. This is hardly a Russian Imperial Stout...it is a mediocre Belgian Strong Ale at best. Disappointing."
SNAB Czaar Peter;Purmerend, Netherlands;Stout - Imperial;SNAB;Bottle received in trade with tricksta_p, cheers! Pours dark brown with an average sized lasting off-white head.

SNAB Czaar Peter;Purmerend, Netherlands;Stout - Imperial;SNAB;Bottle. Dark brown, almost black. Very malty (roast/burnt malts, toffee, burnt sugar, chocolate, hint of coffee). Fruity (dark fruits, berries). Spicy and yeasty. Sweet throughout. Alcohol quite noticeable. Drying roast malty finish. More Belgian than Imperial? (2008)
SNAB Czaar Peter;Purmerend, Netherlands;Stout - Imperial;SNAB;Deze Russian imperial stout is wat eentonig. Mooie donkere kleur met beige schuimlaag. Smaak: lichte koffie en chocolade. Geen echte zoete laag. Er zit weinig diepte in de smaak, noch in het aroma.
SNAB Sprengen;Purmerend, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;SNAB;Bottle. From Bottles, London. No date. Foams up hugely in a manner to suggest this is bottle conditioned. Marmite aroma. Cloudy amber colour. Marmite, cardboard and metal flavours with sweet dark malts and a hint of roasty bits. This tastes like an old bottle, though it certainly has plenty of life in it. Enjoyable and interesting. I don't know what style it is, but it certainly aint a Kolsch!

River City Brewing (Florida) Red Rooster;Jacksonville, Florida, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;River City Brewing Company (Florida);on tap @ Red Rooster / Jacksonville FL --- Clear medium amber with a beige rim head and light streaks of lace. Taste is woody malt that shows tiny hints of chocolate and earth, followed by carbonation on the swallow. The finish turns only a little hoppy. A very light brew with little complexity.

Pours amber with a trace of off-white head; short retention and no lacing. Aroma is caramel and bread malts.

River City Brewing (Florida) Red Rooster;Jacksonville, Florida, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;River City Brewing Company (Florida);"Tap at River City Brewing in downtown Jacksonville. Not sure what is up with this place, but it doesnâ€™t look like their brewhouse has been used in years (mold and cobwebs in the mashtun and brew kettle room). No fermentation vessels to be found anywhere unless they are upstairs and this place has some sort of insanely reinforced roof. Anyway, every beer here I tried was the same. No head formation. No lace. Force carbonated. And all were severely lactic infected so that everything tasted like tart soda. Not gross by any means, but certainly not to style and certainly not to the ""German Reinheitsgebot"" as is mentioned in the brewpub/restaurant. Red Rooster pours a clear reddish amber. Darker SRM than the pale ale (a good sign). No head/no lace. Soda carbonation. Caramel and maple nose but wildly weak. Taste up front is like straight caramel syrup and caramel candies. Sweet and thick feeling. Soon, though, the lactic tartness takes over to turn this into some sort of lemon tea cream soda. Interesting. Could be served to children as ""cream soda lemonade"" and no one would ever even consider the possibility that it was an alcoholic beverage and much less beer. Altbier? Holy Moses."
River City Brewing (Florida) Red Rooster;Jacksonville, Florida, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;River City Brewing Company (Florida);Amber pour with off white head and lace. Wheaty maltiness on the nose. Caramel malty flavor with a light bitter finish. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Decent beer.
River City Brewing (Florida) Red Rooster;Jacksonville, Florida, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;River City Brewing Company (Florida);On tap at the River City brewpub. Pours deep copper with off white head. The mild aroma has faint crystal malt notes at a just noticeable level and nothing else. The taste is as mild as the aroma with a touch of roast, crystal maltiness and a sense of faint vague hop bitterness. I get moments of dryness from the wafer thin layer of roastiness in this brew.
River City Brewing (Florida) Red Rooster;Jacksonville, Florida, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;River City Brewing Company (Florida);Tap @ brewpub. Just like the rest of their offerings. Nasty, tasteless, boring. pours copper, white head. Aroma light malt, some faint roast and yeast. Flavor light roasted malts, caramel, with some weak hoppy notes. I feel bad for their brewer.
River City Brewing (Florida) Red Rooster;Jacksonville, Florida, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;River City Brewing Company (Florida);Amber color. Aroma of lightly toasted malts. Flavor is chestnuts and cara malts. Light bodied. Nice balance. 25 July 09
River City Brewing (Florida) Red Rooster;Jacksonville, Florida, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;River City Brewing Company (Florida);Reddish-copper. Malty aroma. Sweet and syrupy with some bread character redeeming it from hell but overall is like something made at a Hops.

Newport Beach Pelican Pale Ale;Newport Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Newport Beach Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub The APA poured a clear light gold color with a small off white head and lacing. The aroma was more citrus than malt. The overall taste was good but could have more hop flavor. The ale had a light body and average carbonation. In the back, hop bitterness takes hold, inducing a lasting dry swallow. This a special place with above average beer.

Aroma of fresh hops, light malt and a good citrus and grapefruit scent. Medium-bodied; Potent fresh hops show well, with a good malt backbone and some other light herbal tastes. Aftertaste shows a bit of grass, some light yeast and a good dose of citrus and grapefruit hops, all with a good malt backbone. Overall, a nice pale that shows well and leaves the mouth slightly puckered from the bitterness.

Sulphury DMS, sweet creamed corn and dowdy boiled cabbage - not good. But this wanes a good five minutes after. There is light herbal and metallic notes and a relinquishing spicy, peppery note that saves it. Drabby, moderately dry and sulphury palate. DMS is high. Medial, swift lick of sweet candi upfront. Mildly chemical; just has that pizazz. Cereal-like malt lingers. Carbonation is light, spritzy. Flat finish; no crispness. But then the sweetness builds as it warms. Slight of herbal, grassy notes. A bit of a wash. Not hard to drink, but not quite a long quaffer!! (50cL can, Aldi Cannington)"

Saint-Omer 1866;Saint Omer, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint-Omer;I drank this beer the last week in Geneva with Alex, in one Portuguese restaurant in Geneva. In my own opinion, it is not a piece of Art or not like Proust looking for the lost time but looking for the eternal quality that this beer doesnâ€™t have. It is a basical lager, nothing more, any pleasure to drink it, even from the tap. The body is yellow and gold, unpleasant metalic side, watery, not really malty and the hop is coming from the lost paradise and the malt from Tchernobyl, barely drinkable.
Saint-Omer 1866;Saint Omer, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint-Omer;Bottle. Very pale golden color, white foam. Sad aroma: corn, swamp, ooze, sweetness, a bit malt. Taste: malt, candy, light sweetness. Bored.

Stoddards IPA;Sunnyvale, California, United States;IPA;Stoddards Brewhouse;From what I remember, this was a mellow IPA, and not really hoppy. Notes of pine, but more ESB-ish.
Stoddards IPA;Sunnyvale, California, United States;IPA;Stoddards Brewhouse;Pretty standard west coast IPA. Amber color, thin head, light citrus hoppy aroma. Not much bitterness to match the hoppy flavor. Fairly light bodied, refreshing. Could use a bit more malt and a bit more alcohol.
Stoddards IPA;Sunnyvale, California, United States;IPA;Stoddards Brewhouse;Draft. Coppery beer with a thin white head. Not as hoppy of an aroma as many IPAâ€™s. Summer fruit flavors with some malt backing. Good balance and a nice creamy mouthfeel.
Stoddards IPA;Sunnyvale, California, United States;IPA;Stoddards Brewhouse;Poured a coppery gold with a creamy white head. Hoppy aroma with overtones of malty sweetness. Light bitter beginning with a malty explosion that hits you like a ton of... well... malt. Finishes quickly with a strong bitter that fades into the faintest sensation at the back of your tongue. A fine IPA.
Stoddards IPA;Sunnyvale, California, United States;IPA;Stoddards Brewhouse;Medium gold color. Medium head. Aroma is grassy and floral. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are fruity and slightly sweet. Hops are fairly bitter, grapefruity and floral. Leans a little toward the malt sweetness. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Stoddards IPA;Sunnyvale, California, United States;IPA;Stoddards Brewhouse;"Arrived in Sunnyvale on the 17th, and headed straight to Stoddards based on a recommendation from the kind peeps in the Ratebeer forum. This was my second selection after I cleansed my palate. I enjoyed a superb veggie quesadia (sp?) with this. This brew pours from the tap a clear medium copper. The average tight off white head is fully lasting with decent lacing. The nose is pine and flowers. The taste is very well balanced for the style. Toasty start followed by a sweetish middle and a long toasted bitter finish. Not super complex but the refreshing balance makes up for it. Could use some more spice and acidity. The palate is medium to full, soft and creamy and finishes clean. I'm not sure what ""American Style"" means, but if it is in reference to the ""Bigger is Better"" philosophy, than it would be a misnomer in this case. Though a solid offering, this is a small IPA."
Stoddards IPA;Sunnyvale, California, United States;IPA;Stoddards Brewhouse;Tap. Dark golden color with a nice white head. Lots of hops makes it quite bitter. I found this beer sort of odd in how quickly it dies. A little too watery.

Schaffer-BrÃ¤u Schnaittacher Lager;Schnaittach, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Schaffer;Clear golden coloured body with a thinnish pure white head. Aroma of biscuits, grain, alcohol, pungent toffee and alcohol and a dose of nuts and very little else. Light grainy bite with some toffee, earth, nuts and light apples and a dose of pine noticeable on the end with some softer flavours towards the finish. Aftertaste shows only the grain, light nuts, earth and a dose of caramel, toffee and caster sugar with a touch of biscuits, yeast and some more harsh herbal lager characteristics at the very end. Overall, a pretty standard lager with a big and heavy malt and toffee hit showing bunches of more assertive and slightly astringent and medicinal lager flavours with the yeast, biscuits, grain and nuts all very strong, especially at the end. What starts as an easy drink finishes a lot stronger with only a touch of the sweetness coming through to finish it off.

Finishes with hint of lingering spice, light alcohol bitter, and earthy hops. Sampled 5/17/2000.
Pelican Millennium Madness Lager;Pacific City, Oregon, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Pelican Brewing Company;Purchased in Jackson Hole, Wyoming as singles in May 2002 One time brew made for the Millennium Y2K Madness - not sure when it was released -12 oz bottle - States right on the bottle that it can be cellared, so I did. Opening this was exciting, even though its a lager I was hoping for perhaps a Bigfoot quality. Unfortunately it wasn't what I was expecting but good non the less. Color is a deep golden bronze/coppery yellow with just a bit of fizzy head and bubbles. Smells of sweet malt and floral hops and spice, very clean and soft with caramel and sweetbread notes. Taste is good, mostly roasted malt thats sweet and robust with a caramel stickyness and smoothness that leads right into the spicy floral hop thats quickly biting and dry. Nothing overpowering, its balanced well. Surprising for having it sit for so long. I wish I new what the % was cuz it seems strong and makes its presence in the end. Its sneaky.
Pelican Millennium Madness Lager;Pacific City, Oregon, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Pelican Brewing Company;Bottle #80/240 signed by Brewer Darron Welch. I bought this at the brewery in Pacific City, OR in mid-October 2002. There could not be a better location for a brewpub. Imagine drinking fantastic beers on a beautiful beach. I only wish I could have stayed until sunset. The bottle says to cellar this as you would a fine vintage. An Imperial Pilsner! What a fantastic brew. Deep amber color with a nice head. Dense, sweet, malty, caramel, reminds me of a barley wine. It''s rich and beautiful.
Berry Hopper;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);"And so we come to the third and last in DB Breweriesâ€™ unholy trinity of â€™Hopperâ€™ fruit beers, now thankfully consigned to the dustbin of history. Iâ€™d love to think the copy-writer had his/her tongue firmly in cheek when writing the delightfully ambiguous marketing pitch on the bottle: ""If you canâ€™t quite believe the taste, flavour and sheer schmaltz of this berry hopper, donâ€™t worry - nor can we"". But I fear not. This comes in a 330ml bottle wrapped from tip to toe in cherry-coloured plastic, which is perhaps why they didnâ€™t add a colouring along with the flavourings and food acid 330. Consequently, it pours a hazy burnt gold colour that gives no clue to its character. No head, no lace, not a hint of life in the murky depths. Raise it to the nose and you may experience a rush of â€™sense memoriesâ€™ of when you were four or five years old and lived on a diet of Ribena and iced lollies. The aroma screams sugar. I could almost feel my teeth disintegrating under the smell: raspberry cordial, lemonade, strawberry bonbons. This bottle is months past its â€™best byâ€™ date, which might explain the flat, under-carbonated palate. But looking at the other ratings, perhaps not. As in the other Hoppers, the sweet, fruity flavourings mask any trace of malt or hops. The flavouring is an anonymous berry mix - raspberries, strawberries, cherries, etc, with nothing in particular dominant. If you donâ€™t mind cordials, this is drinkable. However, as the bottle says, ""This is not beer as we know it"". Amen to that. (BTW, anyone who enjoys quality writing should read SilkTorkâ€™s review of this - itâ€™s a classic.) (330ml bottle, Amatos, bb 21/2/05)"
Berry Hopper;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);This is awful, omg what did they do to the beer? My flatmate got given heaps for free and had so much trouble trying to get through it all.
Berry Hopper;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);"Not much to be said for this one. The berry taste is ""nice""...then again I have virtually no experience of fruit beers. A strength of 5% ABV is usually my minimum requirement so this one passes that particular test. I, if offered one or left with no other decent choice, would have another."
Berry Hopper;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);"Bottled raspberry ice lolly with alcohol. My name is SilkTork; I'm a kitchen designer living in Kent - and I'm addicted to fruit beers. I'll drink anything that's a combination of fruit and beer. I started with the standard krieks, moved quickly onto the Chapeau range of pear, apricot and apple flavoured beers, and was soon mainlining on Floris Gaardenbeers. It wasn't long before I was waiting for my man. I was jeered, abused, spat on - but I had to get my fix. He was always late. But then he would turn up and thrust a St Louis Peche in my hand and I had to do it right there. No self-control. No shame. No idea of the mess I was getting into. I would sit on the park benches with the meths drinkers. They'd gather round sympathetically. ""What you got in the brown bag?"" they'd ask. ""Floris Chocolat,"" I'd reply. And they'd all move away from me on the bench. I thought I couldn't sink any lower. But then, in a dark Soho alley, late at night when all respectable people were in bed dreaming of decent, hearty stouts and the manly power of a high alcohol IPA, I scored a bottle of Berry Hopper from a slimy pimp in pink jodpers. The bottle was covered in indecent shades of scarlet. I couldn't help myself! ""This is not beer as we know!"" screamed the label. ""Drink me! Drink me now you bad boy!"" it urged. I couldn't help myself. Believe me. Cheap, stale beer enfused with Food Acid Flavouring 330 - how could I resist! There is no lower than this. I have truly consumed the world's worse fruit beer and enjoyed it! Mother of God, is this the end of SilkTork?"
Berry Hopper;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);close your eyes and it's raspberry cordial. look at the glass and it's a lager. i wish they'd put some red food colouring in it so I wouldn't get so confused. definitely the worst framboise i've ever had.
Berry Hopper;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);quite amazing. looks like a standard lager but smells and tastes a vodka cruiser or something, mixed with leftover stale beer. lots of lemonade ice block in there. why not make a proper fruit beer?

Berry Hopper;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Tastes like cordial. Very sweet, lolly like flavour, they must use a very week lager, coz you can't even taste any hops, malt etc. Couldn't get into it at all.

Flat Branch Smoked Porter;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Porter - Smoked;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Draft: Ruby black. Jagged ring of light-tan bubbles. Roasted wood and unsweetened chocolate aromas, with a touch of caramel. Both prickly and slick on the palate. Promisingly flavorful, initially, with a tangy salami expression intertwined with juicy plum esters. Fairly firm, as well, with a roasted-wood dryness and a hint of char. Chewy notes of chocolate are able to withstand the dryness, but the malts are fuzzy and lacking vividness. Ensuing plumlike acidity also hinders the malt girth and it becomes much grainier and wetter as things progress. Finishes wet, soggy and acidic with waning malt flavors echoing the faintest whisper of velvety smoke. Way too fizzy and light in body, which disallows the malts to latch onto the palate. Disappointing.
Flat Branch Smoked Porter;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Porter - Smoked;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Dark black in color, nice lasting creamy tan head, roasty smokey aroma. Roasted smokey burnt coffee flavors, nice dry burnt bitternes in the finish. Light-medium body light creamy mouthfeel, this is decent porter, maybe just a bit lighter than I like.

Flat Branch Bare Knuckle Bock;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Vanilla and caramel dominate this nice offering. Carbonated. Malty. Not intensely dark or sweet, but the best Flat Branch Iâ€™ve had in awhile.
Flat Branch Bare Knuckle Bock;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Sampler @ brewpub. It has a clear but dark burgundy brown color and comes with no head but a bit of hairline halo white around the edge. Aroma is full of sweetness. dark fruits, alcohol. At this point I figured out its a doppelbock. Taste follows suite. It was in a rather weird place, way beyond the point of what a regular doppelbock should be but not far enough into the Samiclaus territory. I feel they need to either tone it down and bring it back to normal or make the full push to the dark side.
Flat Branch Bare Knuckle Bock;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;2005 vintage on tap at the brewery. Aroma of dark malts and a little bit of smoke. Flavor is sweet malt with ripe fruits, very light smoke, and woodiness.
Flat Branch Bare Knuckle Bock;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;On tap at brewery:A grape nose like Dimetapp cough syrup which rang well into the flavor which gave that burn/itchy throat sensation you get from a grape icee-pop. Deep near black color and decent head, but whereâ€™s the complexity? The balance? come on, give me something to appreciate. The yeasts were stale and lifeless, the malts simple and hella sweet and the hops was nonfunctional. Alas, a immature, underdeveloped and lazy attempt at a style that demands respect and tradition. Flat Branch isnâ€™t serious enough for a brew of this difficulty.
Flat Branch Bare Knuckle Bock;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Draught: The beer is a opaque brown, with some tan head. Serious malt taste and nose. I also get some fruit notes to the nose, of which cherries appear to be the most evident. The taste has some evidence of the cherries as well as a hint of roastiness. Served only in a 10oz. glass. I suspect the alchohol content is quite high, but it isn't noticeable.

The flavor is fairly rich and malty, but not sweet - excellent balance. In fact, this actually trends slightly bitter in the finish. Whatâ€™s not to like? Bottle courtesy of BVery!
Diamond Bear Rocktoberfest;North Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Diamond Bear Brewing Company;Pours a copper gold color. Two finger head, okay lacing. Itâ€™s not clear, itâ€™s a little cloudy, and a little sediment floating around in there. Aroma is amazing. Itâ€™s quite malty, and a little hoppy. Quite bready. It is quite sweet smelling. It smells like a Caramello bar. Such a high caramel aroma, I want to take a bath in it.. With a nose like that you would expect the taste to follow suit. But not so fast. Iâ€™m a little disappointed in the taste. Itâ€™s very malty in taste, itâ€™s also a little hoppy. Itâ€™s bready. Itâ€™s sweet, but Iâ€™m not so much tasting the caramel I was smelling. Iâ€™m really tasting the malts. Itâ€™s very bready to the taste. Itâ€™s a little sweet, but very bready. Mouthfeel is excellent. Itâ€™s easy drinking. Itâ€™s sweet, and dry. Thereâ€™s barely any bitterness. Itâ€™s highly drinkable, and 6.1% ABV, is barely noticeable. Itâ€™s medium body at best. Maybe just a tiny bit of bitterness on the finish. Overall, this is really good. Absolutely try this one if you can find it. I wish that caramel on the nose could make it into the taste. But otherwise, itâ€™s still a fine Marzen!

Cricket Hill American Ale;Fairfield, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cricket Hill Brewing Co.;"From Aug 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with jwc215. Thanks Joe! It pours a clear copper colour with a 1 finger head of foam. There's a little bit of lacing and the head retention is average. The smell has a nice mix of citrus hops and caramel malt with the hops being more noticeable. The taste is pretty hoppy. I get some citrus and some grass and the malt is rather subdued; just a slight sweetness and breadiness right before the finish. The mouthfeel is on the thin side and kind of slick, the carbonation is on the light side, and it finishes with a mild grassy bitterness. Well, everything flavourwise seems to be on the mild side but what's there is good and it sure is drinkable enough. I could put a couple away with ease. Pretty good stuff."
Cricket Hill American Ale;Fairfield, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cricket Hill Brewing Co.;This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a dark rugged amber color with a fingerâ€™s worth of foamy white head that dissipated at a nice pace. Slow moderate lace. The aroma takes on a blend of caramel and toffee malts to blend with some citrus bitter hops. The flavor balances nicely between the citrusy bitter hops to the sweetness of the malts. Light blended aftertaste with finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Low carbonation feels good, nice and low. Overall, good amber ale that I would come back to.

Auerhahn Urhahn Helles Alt;Lauterbach, Hesse, Germany;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;Lauterbacher - Auerhahn (Hochstiftliches Brauhaus);I was brought up on Altbier which is dark. KÃ¶lsch is blond, both are top-fermented, but coming from an Altbier-region, KÃ¶lsch is off-scope by definition. So I have troubles getting over a Blond Altbier.

Sailor Hagars Honey Pilsner;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;Pint on tap at Sailor Hagarâ€™s in North Vancouver. Beer is brewed by Howe Sound Brewing and is Howe Sound Pilsner Plunge under a sudonym. Appearance: Orangey gold and slightly opaque, with a vibrant bubbly white head that quickly recedes to a gentle ring, but leaves lots of lacing. Aroma: Not overpowering, but inviting. Subtle honey, and the kind of crisp hop aroma you can only get from a good quality pilsner. Taste: Crisp and refreshing, with subtle honey and a big hop flavour. Lots of bitterness and some tart citrus flavours from the hops. This beer shows how both a honey lager and a pilsner should be made, unlike many others in the Pacific northwest. Pilsners in the PNW tend to be a little sweet for the style, but this beer from Howe Sound only has subtle sweetness from the honey, with no other unfortunate sweetness. It is very tempered with the hops, so the overall flavour is bitter, not sweet, with the honey adding complexity and flavour rather than rich sweetness. The finish is very long and bitter, only slightly dry, with hints of honey and subtle grassiness from the Saaz hops, and is intensely rewarding. One of the nicest pilsners anywhere in the world. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and faintly silky from the honey. Drinkability: Very moreish. Simply not possible to only have one of these exceptional pilsners.
Sailor Hagars Honey Pilsner;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;(Draught) Pours a medium, foamy white head with a amber body. Nose of mild English malts and a touch of honey sweetner. The flavour lines-up similarly with the additional Czech Pils hoppiness and bitter finish. Somewhat average at best.
Sailor Hagars Honey Pilsner;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;I donâ€™t know if theyâ€™ve changed the recipe since I last had this, but it seems to be improved. Pale golden, creamy white head. Pale malt aroma with some light honey underneath but also a fairly assertive Saaz aroma. Spicy flavour with a touch of breadiness. Lingering bitterness. Quite a surprise, actually.
Sailor Hagars Honey Pilsner;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sailor Hagars Brew Pub;This was always the crapper of the Hagarâ€™s lineup, but itâ€™s gone straight up macro since Howe Sound took over. Light straw colour. Grainy aroma with doughy yeast note and ultra bland hops. I doubt theyâ€™re using teutonic nor slavic varieties anymore. Probably more like Willamette or something equally flavorless, and in miniscule quantities.

Alhambra Reserva 1925;Granada, Spain;Pale Lager - Strong;Cervezas Alhambra (Mahou San Miguel);I have bought this bottle, in one Spanish shop, at PrÃ©laz, Lausanne. Tasting and judging this bottle, at home, Epalinges. To be sincere, it is not my favourite beer, too sweet, warm and heavy alcool, sugar, side of peach, malt and hop, there is definitely an unpleasant sensation at the mouth.

Compass Creek Amber 66;Rancho Cucamonga, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Compass Creek Steakhouse & Brewing Company;This was listed at the brewpub as an amber and its a pretty big interpretation.

Garton Liquid Lobotomy;Driffield, East Yorkshire, England;Stout;Garton;First tasted this at the Paisley Beer Festival in April 2004. Cask, gravity dispense. Dull black in colour with a thin tan head which quickly disappeared. Strange sickly note of parmesan cheese, long in intensity. Slick very thick oily texture in the mouth and no lacing of note. Dark malt complex gives a dusty burnt toast note which soon fades to give a strong roast coffee bean, bitter chocolate, liquorice and burnt treacle toffee in the thick mouthfeel. Earthy hops just barely detected in the very short aftertaste. Finish is smokey and dry with peat, old leather and dessicated molasses giving an impression of an oyster stout with imperial strength . Could only manage one pint of this but worth trying for the smell alone!
Garton Liquid Lobotomy;Driffield, East Yorkshire, England;Stout;Garton;19th October 2007 Warning! Early amateur rating! Draft at the Brew Wharf mini beer festival. Dark beer. Treacly with mild carbonation and a fruit pudding tang. Not bitter. Dangerously drinkable!

Black in colour not much of a head, some roasty malty and slightly woody aromas, taste a bit sweet but with some dark chocolate and coffee edges to it great stuff, but a pint mmhh.. maybe we were going for it a bit.
Garton Liquid Lobotomy;Driffield, East Yorkshire, England;Stout;Garton;Gravity cask @ Reading Beer Festivalk 2006. Sweet. Some roast and brown sugar aromas. Not enough roastiness comes through in the flavour to counter the sweet body.

Beermanns Hefeweizen;Lincoln, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Beermanns Beerwerks Brewery;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a large sized head of foamy finely sized bubbles that was long lasting and left behind a hazy typically carbonated yellow brown colored body and a fair lacing. The aroma was malty banana apricot and fruity. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish. The flavor contained notes of malt and yeast. A average hefe but not one that I would consider buying again.
Beermanns Hefeweizen;Lincoln, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Beermanns Beerwerks Brewery;Bottle marked 5.2% ABV. Fizzy, large white head that mostly diminished, very poor lacing, carbonated, cloudy, and a straw yellow hue. Sweet, some light banana, spicy, and clove nose. Banana was too light nosed for this style. Sweet, some acidity, light banana, spicy, and clove for the flavor. Again, too light tasting for this style. Disappointing considering this is one of my favorites beer styles. Tingly mouthfeel and medium body. Driinkable, but nothing to really rave about.
Beermanns Hefeweizen;Lincoln, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Beermanns Beerwerks Brewery;umm....Poured light golden yellow with white head. Tangy vanilla with some mild bitterness to it. could be better and not really a strong effort.

Beermanns Hefeweizen;Lincoln, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Beermanns Beerwerks Brewery;Sorry, Iâ€™m a serious Hefe guy. Oakes shared this one with us and I really wasnâ€™t impressed. Too much carbonation and a bland vanilla flavor. Iâ€™d pass on this and go Deutsch instead..

Butterfield Blackout Stout;Fresno, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Butterfield Brewing Company;Very black beer with a small, tight head. Strong smokey presence with a bitter tinge.

Redwood Lodge Octoberfest;Flint, Michigan, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redwood Lodge Brewery;Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance â€“ The beer is served a reddish amber color with one finger head of fizzy white head. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading to leave a massive level of fizzy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell â€“ The aroma is light overall with the heaviest of the aromas being of a toasted smell along with some lighter sweet smells of a fruit nature with some cherry and apple as well as a hint of a caramel. Taste â€“ The taste begins with a rather sweet taste with it being a mix of caramel and some lighter fruits of apple and cherry. The caramel fades after the initial taste but the sweeter fruit flavors gain intensity as the taste advances, bringing an overall sweeter flavor to the brew. Right from the start there is also a toasted bready taste which takes on more and more grainy notes as the taste advances. Along with these tastes also comes some very light hop flavors of a more herbal and earthy nature. These hops remain rather light, and in the end with the mix of flavors, one is left with a rather sweet and toasted flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel â€“ The body of the brew is on the average side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is rather average. Both are very nice for the style and complement well the fruit and toasted tastes well. Overall â€“ A fruity and easy drinking Oktoberfest. A nice brew overall and one to try if you get the chance.

Redwood Lodge Octoberfest;Flint, Michigan, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redwood Lodge Brewery;On tap at the brewpub in 9/08. Coppery orange color with nice creamy white head.

Redwood Lodge Octoberfest;Flint, Michigan, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redwood Lodge Brewery;Sample at the brewpub: This beer is a light and clear amber/orange color with a medium thin off-white head. Thin spotty lacing. Sweet caramel and malt in the nose. On the light side for the style, with a bittersweet malt and hops flavor. The finish is sweet and short, with the hops struggling to linger. All in all this one is unremarkable.
Redwood Lodge Octoberfest;Flint, Michigan, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redwood Lodge Brewery;An average fest beer. Caramel malts and nice hop presence, but overall, flavor was too syrupy sweet.
Brays Orien Oatmeal Pale Ale;Naples, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brays Brewing;Draft at the brewery. Pours very cloudy dark gold with a very thin white head.

Brays Orien Oatmeal Pale Ale;Naples, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brays Brewing;"On tap at the breweryâ€™s ""One night stand"" event. Using oatmeal in a pale ale is a novel idea. It gives this slightly bland tasting beer a great mouthfeel and weight in the mouth. The aroma is pretty much pale malt with a hint of dingy cellar. The taste is pretty nice, albeit a bit boring, somewhat standard tasting APA, i like mine with more hop kick."
Brays Orien Oatmeal Pale Ale;Naples, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brays Brewing;An interesting idea, I thought. Unfiltered/cloudy orange color, no strong aromas to speak of (hard to swirl around a 5oz. glass that''s full), chewy mouthfeel with a lingering bitter aftertaste. I''d like to give this another go but its damn near impossible to find - a rarely brewed beer from one of Maine''s smallest brewers.
Brays Orien Oatmeal Pale Ale;Naples, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brays Brewing;On tap Maine Brewers Fest 2002: Hazy yellow/orange color, rich malt and oatmeal(?) aroma. Smooth full mouthfeel, rich ending and slightly bitter. An odd but not unpleasant aftertaste, most likely due to the oatmeal in it. Certainly a unique brew.

La Sancerroise La DrÃ´lesse;Sancerre, France;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sancerroise;Nice BdG nose, some cereal grains, floral hops, dusty yeast. The taste is moderately sweet, lightly bitter, lots of honey, cereal grains, light earthy hops. Decent, but I donâ€™t think this bottle is very fresh.... actually it was about 8 months past itâ€™s best by date.
La Sancerroise La DrÃ´lesse;Sancerre, France;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sancerroise;Uh-oh. First gusher Iâ€™ve had in a while, not a good sign for something that is supposed to be a lager. Come to think of it, I donâ€™t ever recall having a lager that was a gusher. Pale gold with a lot of particulate haze, large head. Aroma was faintly bready with some apple fruit notes. Flavor matched. Faint hint of sourness on the finish. An odd bitter hop note as well that didnâ€™t hang with the other flavors present. This struck me as just a total miss of a beer. Flat out didnâ€™t enjoy it at all.
La Sancerroise La DrÃ´lesse;Sancerre, France;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sancerroise;Bottle from Wine Specialist. Gushed a bit. Hazy gold color with a huge frothy white head. Aroma of citrus and tropical fruit. Near medium body with very frothy/lively carbonation - but itâ€™s bubbly, not sharp. Flavor is lightly malty and a tad yeasty with citrus. Rather astringent. Not super dry, just astringent. A lager that could pass for ale.

The flavor starts with a quick dose of of mild cereal/grain sweetness. The finish has light grass. Itâ€™s light bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, thereâ€™s nothing offensive and nothing exciting. Itâ€™s a solid summer lawn mower beer.

Jarre Creek Ranch Creekside Amber Ale;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jarre Creek Ranch Brewing;Had this beer on 8/24/1998. Color is a good golden brown, carbonation is low and so is the head. It has a sweet malt aroma off the top of the glass. Taste is a little flat with a sweet malt flavor. It starts off with a medium body that feels a little heavier than it is because of the low carbonation. Going down itâ€™s smooth, finishing with a somewhat bland malt flavor. Its just not a good beer.

Herold PÅ¡eniÄnÃ½ KvasnicovÃ½ LeÅ¾Ã¡k (Bohemian Hefeweizen);Breznice, Czech Republic;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pivovar Herold;Not a psenicne you'd expect. Very nice, banana/clove smell. Almost clear, no foam, which is odd for a weizen. The taste is pretty much your average lager with very nice taste of clove, maybe a hint of banana. The body is also low, lager-like. Very odd beer, I can't quite get it, but still I enjoyed it. A separate category of weizen.

Muted nose of orangey fruitiness, pumpernickel bread, overripe plum, graham cracker. Fairly tea-like and candyish, as well. Soft, foamy prickles of carbonation. Sweetly malty with ensuing breadcrust and earthy bitterness. Earthy/woody licorice hoppiness mirrors the earthy malt, though an overripe plum fruitiness sneaks in and contributes a limpness and negates much of the brightness. Dusty yeast notes waver in and out amid the sweet cakey malt. Finishes softly with good balance between the bitter-chocolate-kissed dark bread and nutty malt. You kind of have to reach for things here as thereâ€™s not a whole lot going on, but it could be much worse. Pretty quiet and dull.

Kennebec River Penobscot Porter;The Forks, Maine, United States;Porter;Kennebec River Pub & Brewery;"on tap on the premises. unclear medium dark brown pour with a nice light beige cap offering some retention and lacing. sweet coffee, charred roastiness, blue and black ""fresh"" grapes,Â lots of them, obnoxious grape sweetness combined with wort; faint herbs and grass, fruity yeast action - not really english. moderate carbonation, light body - very oily; sweet fruity finish. bad sweet grapey porter - still one of their ""best"" offerings.."
Kennebec River Penobscot Porter;The Forks, Maine, United States;Porter;Kennebec River Pub & Brewery;From a grrowler. half a finger head, dark reddish brown. that smells pretty good! very toasty, gobs of marshmallow. the flavor...very thin, oily, light, coffee and hazelnut.
Kennebec River Penobscot Porter;The Forks, Maine, United States;Porter;Kennebec River Pub & Brewery;Poured into a nonic pint glass, the appearance was a pure black color with a fingerâ€™s worth of white foamy head. Light stringy lace. The aroma breathed a super nice blend between roasty coffee beans to cocoa nibs. Adds a touch of sweet smoke. The flavor, once again, blends all of the previously mentioned aromas to a wonderful blissful taste. Subtle blended aftertaste with a quick sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Roastiness does hit my tongue in a nice porter-like semi-smooth sort of way. Good carbonation. Overall, very nicely done porter that I would have again.
Kennebec River Penobscot Porter;The Forks, Maine, United States;Porter;Kennebec River Pub & Brewery;Growler. Thx Alex. Pours dark brown with low to no beige head. Aroma is of vanilla, roasted malt. Taste is of vanilla, roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, very slight bitterness. Palate: Medium body. Low carbonation. Overall: Lots of vanilla, decent.
Kennebec River Penobscot Porter;The Forks, Maine, United States;Porter;Kennebec River Pub & Brewery;5 oz. taster @ R.I. Brewfest 2 Feb 2013. Fantastic nose of chocolate, vanilla and coffee. It had thick tan head that laced the plastic cup, which is impressive. The flavor is wonderful. Vanilla and coffee throughout the sip with a nice chocolate malt backbone. A very faint hop in in there as well. I went up for seconds of this porter. Itâ€™s been awhile since I had a porter that is this tasty. It could be classified as a coffee stout. Well crafted.
Kennebec River Penobscot Porter;The Forks, Maine, United States;Porter;Kennebec River Pub & Brewery;(sample at the 2012 Boston Beer Summit Winter Jubilee) black with tan head. Roast malt, slightly sweet molasses.
Kennebec River Penobscot Porter;The Forks, Maine, United States;Porter;Kennebec River Pub & Brewery;tap at the brewpub - Pours very dark brown with a small tan head. It has an aroma of roasted malt with chocolate notes. The flavor is dark roast malt with chocolate. Itâ€™s a medium bodied, flavorful, solid brew with soft carbonation and a lingering roast mocha finish. Well done! Thereâ€™s an interesting range of ratings here. Either our tastes vary really widely or the quality does.
Kennebec River Penobscot Porter;The Forks, Maine, United States;Porter;Kennebec River Pub & Brewery;@NH Brewers Fest-on tap-pours a thin rich light brown head and mahogany color. Aroma is soft roasty/molasses-dark malt. Taste is sweet roasty/molasses-dark malt, secondary earthy hops. Dry finish.
Kennebec River Penobscot Porter;The Forks, Maine, United States;Porter;Kennebec River Pub & Brewery;I had just finished a Sam adams Cream stout by the fireside, when I went up to the brewpub to try this I was very disappointed under fermented and seemingly pushed out for consumption with little regard to quality.
Kennebec River Penobscot Porter;The Forks, Maine, United States;Porter;Kennebec River Pub & Brewery;Dark, almost black porter with a small light creamy head and good lacing. Smells like a cappucino with german malt beer. Tastes of coffee and chocolate with a bitersweet aftertaste. Pretty good porter, but a little thick for my tastes.
Atlantic Mount Desert Island Ginger;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Other;Atlantic Brewing Company;On tap at Atlantic Bar Harbor. It poured a golden color with a white head. The aroma was of wheat, ginger, hops and malts. The taste was similar to the aroma with more wheat, ginger, hops, malts with medium carbonation and a nice smooth aftertaste. Not bad.
Atlantic Mount Desert Island Ginger;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Other;Atlantic Brewing Company;Draft flight at Atlantic Brewing in Bar Harbour, Maine. Cloudy gold color with a small white head. Decent wheat base but waaay to much ginger taste for my liking. Pass.
Atlantic Mount Desert Island Ginger;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Other;Atlantic Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Comes golden brown with an average beige head. Aroma and taste of ginger, malt, and wheat. Not a fan of ginger in beer.
Atlantic Mount Desert Island Ginger;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Other;Atlantic Brewing Company;Nice medium slightly cloudy amber. The wheat and ginger flavor our subtle. This is not my favorite style but I kind of like this beer.
Atlantic Mount Desert Island Ginger;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Other;Atlantic Brewing Company;Light, drinkable, & not over the top ginger. Pretty nice for the summer but nothing special. Decent pour & aroma. Not bad!
Atlantic Mount Desert Island Ginger;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Other;Atlantic Brewing Company;Bottle. Toffee malt and ginger aroma. Hazy amber with small head. Sweet ginger and very light toffee malt flavor. Decent.
Atlantic Mount Desert Island Ginger;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Other;Atlantic Brewing Company;Bottle: Cloudy/dirty gold with a creamy white head. Strong ginger aroma.....light vanilla, wheat. Ginger and wheat malt taste. Sweet and carbonated.. Ok for what itâ€™s advertised, itâ€™s definitely ginger-riffic......but itâ€™s also a little cloying.
Atlantic Mount Desert Island Ginger;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Other;Atlantic Brewing Company;bottle, just a plain lifeless pale ale. Nothing wrong with it, a little grainy. Was just hoping to taste some ginger and i didnâ€™t. Oh well.
Atlantic Mount Desert Island Ginger;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Other;Atlantic Brewing Company;Pours a slightly orangey dark amber with a thin off-white head that is gone quickly. Nose is slightly skunky and reminiscent of the back room of the store I worked at as a teen, where we kept empties. Taste is balanced. Not too sweet. Not particularly hoppy. Ginger comes through in the aftertaste. Medium body. Lively carbonation. Not bad, but not as gingery as I had hoped and not good enough to keep me coming back. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Atlantic Mount Desert Island Ginger;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Other;Atlantic Brewing Company;Hmmm, polarized on this one. Pours a nice orange with a white head, and smells very good, with ginger and lemon. Taste starts of nice, with lots of ginger, but then ends with this weird sweetness that is off putting. Had on tap at the brewery.
Casco Bay Carrabassett Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Shipyard Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Poured an amberish color with an off white head. Stale hops and grainy.
Casco Bay Carrabassett Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Shipyard Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with less than a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a half minute. There was some light stringy lacing. The smell had some burnt caramel malts kind of coming through in a toasty sort of way. The taste was somewhat sweet and toasty. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. However, there seems to be a bit to be desired to show some kind of meat to this thing. Overall, I say this was a one off for me. I most likely wouldnâ€™t have this again.
Casco Bay Carrabassett Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Shipyard Brewing Company;Not a very memorable beer. Hops tasted flat, almost stale. Touch of sweetness was ok, but overall flat.
Casco Bay Carrabassett Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Shipyard Brewing Company;12oz screwtop bottle. Pours copper with very little head. Sweet malt and butter flavors. Pretty average stuff. Drank this while up in Carrabassett Valey assuming it was a local beer only to find it was another shipyard brew in disguise.
Casco Bay Carrabassett Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Shipyard Brewing Company;12oz into a pint from their variety pack. Pours a deep orange amber, head is medium and lingers somewhat, taste is malty first, then a nice rise of the hops that mellow out quite quickly. This is a mellow pale ale, without the hop bite that I perfer, but to each their own. there is a tangy interplay between the malts and the hops but in the end it seems well balanced and tasty. An easy drinker, perfect for the summer, but good for any time really. Not exceptional, but certainlty not a faker.
Casco Bay Carrabassett Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Shipyard Brewing Company;Bottle. I grabbed a 6er of this in Portland ME. This is just not an interesting or worthwhile beer.
Casco Bay Carrabassett Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Shipyard Brewing Company;Another in the series of old beers from my parents' basement. Tickers gotta tick. This beer is definitely past it's prime. It's just a malty mess now. No hops left at all. Pours a golden orange color with no head. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Casco Bay Carrabassett Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Shipyard Brewing Company;from beer on the wall beer of the month. Pours copper with very little head. This beer is lightly sweet and malty, very buttery with a small bit of hoppiness!!
Casco Bay Carrabassett Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Shipyard Brewing Company;Bottle. Light malt and orange aroma. Clear fizzy orange with a small off-white head. Watery grainy malt flavor... like a slightly better than average macro lager. Light carbonated body with a dry finish.
Casco Bay Carrabassett Pale Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Shipyard Brewing Company;Bottle. Orange, cherry and hay malt aroma. Golden yellow color with small head. Sweet corn/barley malt flavor with hint of hay to finish. First ale Iâ€™ve ever had that tastes like a cheap lager (that wasnâ€™t a cream ale).
Fix 1864 Spezial;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Brewery;From old tasting notes. Brewed by Hellenic Breweries in Kiparissi, Fthiotis, Greece.

Fix 1864 Spezial;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Brewery;Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass at the World of Beer in Columbia, SC. The appearance is a clear light gold color with a small white head. The aroma is sweet grains. The taste is grains and possibly corn. An average beer.
Fix 1864 Spezial;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Brewery;12 oz. bottle. Clear straw color with a short-lived white head. Aroma is malty and sweet. Taste is malt, corn, and grass. Mildly sweet finish.
Fix 1864 Spezial;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Brewery;Pint pour from bottle of fairly crisp straw golden with a full dissipating white head. Nose is sweetened dry malts and corn notes. Not too exciting on the flavor either, but it is a tick. Sorta one dimensional pale lager-ish with typical basic crisp malts and faint, minimal hop character.
Fix 1864 Spezial;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Brewery;12 oz bottle. Poured a clear straw yellow color with a razor thin white head and awful head retention. Taste of cheap grain, corn, and grass. This beer sucks
Fix 1864 Spezial;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Brewery;Aromas of toast, flowers, and cereal. Slightly hazy orange gold, no head. Subtle initial malt sweetness, subtle earthy hops. Light bodied, pretty clean.
Fix 1864 Spezial;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Brewery;"Pours a clear golden with white head. Cereal grains on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes clean."
Fix 1864 Spezial;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Brewery;Average, but bland pale lager. Pale golden in color with minimal head, cereal taste and aroma. run of the mill, had to wash down some Greek food in Chicago.
Fix 1864 Spezial;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Brewery;Pours a clear gold with a short white head. The aroma has yeasty bread and light malt notes. It has some apple and malt notes up front and a slightly sweet finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Fix 1864 Spezial;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Brewery;Fix 1864 Spezial has a medium, white head and a clear, yellow, clear, bubbly appearance, with lots of streaming bubbles and no lacing. The aroma is of rather rank, cheap, sweet grain, and the flavor is similar, with grain husk and off-tasting sweetness. Mouthfeel is light and watery, and Fix 1864 Spezial finishes semi-dry and mostly unpleasant, but one can drink it. Overall, this is another cheap, scam-type beer that alleges to be something that it is not. One doubts that the real Fix of Greece tastes anything like this bum. Avoid. RJT
River City Death by Pumpkin Ale;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Other;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);On tap. Off white-hazy dark amber. A-caramel, pumpkin spice, medium malt. T-follows. Towards medium body.
River City Death by Pumpkin Ale;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Other;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);On tap at the brewpub. Comes brownish gold with a small biege head. Aroma of pumpkin, spice, and brandy. Taste is similar. Something off here.
River City Death by Pumpkin Ale;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Other;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);Aging in Brandy barrels really throws this beer off kilter. Light body and very light pumpkin spice flavors are nearly soured by the barrel aging. Needs lots of work.
River City Death by Pumpkin Ale;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Other;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);Tap at brewpub. Pours an average iced tea brown with an aroma of floral plastic pumpkin. Flavor is flat, brackish malt and rose with a bitter medicinal finish. Lousy mouthfeel. Pumpkin? Artificial pumpkin, sure, but not a real one. Avoid.

River City Death by Pumpkin Ale;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Other;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);Orange amber with small head. Light pumpkin, nutmeg and cinnamon aromas - pumpkin pie. Notable pumpkin flavor with some sweet malt and pumpkin pie spiciness. Generally sweet profile that starts OK and becomes cloying. I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin beers, and this is no exception to that - however I'd say its among the best of the pumpkin beers I've tried (read: drinkable).
Tou JuleÃ¸l 4.5%;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Fin duft av rosin og krydder. Lite skum. Fin gyllen brun farge. God smak av rosin, krydder og noe ubestemmelig. Et godt Ã¸l som har hatt godt av Ã¥ stÃ¥ lenge. Drukket 1.Aug. 2013, best fÃ¸r. 11.Jul. 2007.
Tou JuleÃ¸l 4.5%;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);28.11.2003, 0,5l Can. Brunt Ã¸l med fin farge. Ã˜let er litt bittert og surt. Synes kanskje at juleÃ¸l skal vÃ¦re litt sÃ¸tere. Ã˜let er godt humlet og minner kanskje litt for mye om pils.
Tou JuleÃ¸l 4.5%;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Bottle. Red / golden colour with a beige head. Aroma is sweet, caramel, malt. Flavour is sweet, caramel, malt. Too thin to be a full bodied norwegian christmasbeer.
Tou JuleÃ¸l 4.5%;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);330 ml bottle. Clear, golden reddish body with a short, small beige head. Aroma has some pleasant caramel malt notes. Flavor is more disappointing, a watery caramel flavor with some malt and not much more. Itâ€™s a rather fresh and light beer with a big lack of flavors. Just to one-dimensional to get exited over. No Christmas feeling whatsoever.
Tou JuleÃ¸l 4.5%;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Bottle, 33 cl. Nice brown color, some burned sugar, but generally just another watery version of Norwegian Christmas beer. This only has local distribution in the Stavanger area, and I think they generally aim for the nostalgia market!
Tou JuleÃ¸l 4.5%;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Medium creamy offwhite head. Light brown body. Light, fruity caramelly aroma with cinnamon notes. Taste is again light caramel with strong cinnamon notes and a touch of paper. Slightly watery mouthfeel. Some floral hops and bitterness in the aftertaste. Not bad, but could have more taste. (0.33l bottle.)
Tou JuleÃ¸l 4.5%;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);(Bottle 33 cl) Beautiful, clear amber with a small, creamy, off-white head. Distinct (Norwegian - whatever that means) malt character in the aroma. Rather light body with some fine malts and a lightly caramelish sweetness. Some dry bitter hops in the finish. Thereâ€™s an indefinable, not so pleasant and lightly cloying edge to this beer that I have dificulties explaining. 271205
Tou JuleÃ¸l 4.5%;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Bottled. Golden-orange with a nice off-white head. Weak malty and hoppy aroma. After a long day of Christmas-preparations, and no beer, it felt good to drink, but when I really tasted it, well thereâ€™s not much taste in it. I probably rated it too cold, but it felt mostly like a Norwegian Christmas-sodapop with a hoppy finish. Feel some metal too, pity itâ€™s in the taste of the beer, and not music from my stereo. There is some boiled vegetables in the aroma too. That made the aroma change from 4 to 3 in my opinion. Thin body. Afterall this is not a too bad beer, just not interesting, but as far as I remember, it tasted better some years ago, before Ringnes took over, but on the other hand, it might be my preferences that have changed. (051222)
Tou JuleÃ¸l 4.5%;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Well, this is totally waste. Bad pilsner with some colour added. It was slightly better some years ago, when it was still bottled, but not by much.
Tou JuleÃ¸l 4.5%;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);"Copper coloured Christmas beer, brewed for the Norwegian grocery store market when the traditional ""klasse F"" Christmas beers could be sold only through the government owned Vinmonopolet stores. This beer is an example of the fact that the JuleÃ¸l style NEEDS an ABV of 6,2% - 7% to be decent. The beer looks good, but that''s all. Bland metallic flavour, just a hint of caramel. It''s stunning how little taste they have managed to put into this beer. Low score in all Xmas beer ratings in Norwegian newspapers - well deserved. BTW, like (nearly) all Norwegians, I believed that Norwegian JuleÃ¸l was a style in its own right - I actually learned from RateBeer that they could be classified as Vienna. (I don''t know if people living in Vienna would agree.) Fortunately, the best ""klasse F"" beers are a lot better than this."

Ringnes Julebrygg;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);330ml bottle. Golden, dark reddish body with a beige head.

Ringnes Julebrygg;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);330ml bottle enjoyed at home. Dark reddish body with nice clarity and some brownish foam. Slightly roasted malty to the nose. Taste of dried apricot and dark friuts. A sweet yeasty touch at the end. Moderate carbonated. Better than most of the low-alcohol xmas beers I have tried so far this year (though that does not say much) (24.11.2006).
Ringnes Julebrygg;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Bottle. 2006 Christmas seasonal. Dark amber, tiny head. Hardly no aroma... Slight caramel and malt flavors. Thin body. Sourish finish. Average all over.
Ringnes Julebrygg;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);This beer has a color that mostly reminds me of a red fruitsyrup and water mix for kids, though it has a beige head. The aroma is dusty hoppy combined with notes of berries. The flavor is dry dusty hoppy again with notes of berries - the flavor also reminds me of a kids soft drink - besides the alcohol content.
Babycham Sparkling Perry;Weybridge, Surrey, England;Perry;Accolade Wines;0,75 flaske med champagnekork delt pÃ¥ (alltid like) hyggelig RBHD-treff hos Odd Gunnar mars-18: blek strÃ¥gul med kort skum. Pussig aroma av kunstige sÃ¸tstoffer og umodne pÃ¦rer. Barnebrus for voksne.
Babycham Sparkling Perry;Weybridge, Surrey, England;Perry;Accolade Wines;Shared bottle at RB/HD at GunnarÂ´s 08.03.19. Very, very and pale clear yellow. Small, white head. First a quick shock of ammoniac in aroma, but this dissapears almost immediately. Then amoderate aroma of pears. Taste is of neutral perry with some bitterness.
Babycham Sparkling Perry;Weybridge, Surrey, England;Perry;Accolade Wines;Shared 750 ml clear bottle (caged & corked), from British Corner Shop. ABV is 5.5%. Very pale yellow colour. Bad aroma, desinfectant and only a hint of pears. The flavour is better, notes of pear and sugar. Not something I'll buy again though.

Babycham Sparkling Perry;Weybridge, Surrey, England;Perry;Accolade Wines;"200 ml bottle bought at The magstore on Nathan Road, Yau Ma Tei. Clear pale blonde colour; Near zero head with residual soapy white form which fades in 5 seconds; No lacing with barely notable slight carbonation; Sweet aroma of pear wine, with sulphur, floral and sugar; Very light sweet taste of white wine, with tartness and hint of sugar; Light body, watery palate; Mouth feel is thin white wine in very runny background with virtually no pear taste. Quite tart with only traces of sweetness. No barrel nor tannin. Blah!... Fairly dry after taste. Tart and easy to mouth. Comments: This so-called historical brand is a yawner, with taste pretty much like a watered down white wine and almost no character to speak of, not even a hint of carbo. Bland and useless just like the Bulmer Pear Cider. Glad it's only a baby bottle."
Babycham Sparkling Perry;Weybridge, Surrey, England;Perry;Accolade Wines;Bottle from ASDA online. Chemical pear aroma with added saccharine. Pale gold. A steady rise of bubbles. White head just clings to the inside rim. Light-medium sweet which then develops sourness. Reminds me of sour jelly sweets. Light-medium bodied. Slick. Soft carbonation. Dry finish. The palate's probably the best thing about it. Mass produced factory Perry.
Babycham Sparkling Perry;Weybridge, Surrey, England;Perry;Accolade Wines;Bottle (gift) bought at Tesco. Pours very pale gold with no head. Aroma of pear and citrus. Heavy sweetness, light bitterness, touch of sour. Light body, oily texture, fizzy carbonation.

BFM La Dragonne;SaignelÃ©gier, Switzerland;Flavored - Other;BFM (Brasserie des Franches-Montagnes);Shared 0,75l bottle @ One Pint Pub, Christmas tasting. Pours clear deep red with a low head. Aroma is sweet fruity and spicy malts. Flavor is sweet malts with berries and spices. Quite tasty.

Aroma is chocolate, anis, cinnamon, Lebkuchen. Taste is sweet, anis, Lebkuchen, cinnamon. Flat. Very interesting, and fun. Quite intense though.
BFM La Dragonne;SaignelÃ©gier, Switzerland;Flavored - Other;BFM (Brasserie des Franches-Montagnes);Bottle, heated to 45Â°C, from the brewery shop. Aroma is like a mulled wine: wintery spices, herbs, ginger, cardamom, gingerbread man. Body is warming, a little boozy, strong. Quite nice, actually, but the spice mix is clearly a matter of taste.
BFM La Dragonne;SaignelÃ©gier, Switzerland;Flavored - Other;BFM (Brasserie des Franches-Montagnes);"donâ€™t let yourself be fooled, this is a fairly weird one. You might actually have to follow the label on preparation steps. Placing this beer in the ""Spice/Herb/Vegetable"" really doesnâ€™t do it justice as it is a GlÃ¼hbier, meaning that it is supposed to be consumed hot. Compared to other examples of the style such as Liefmans GlÃ¼hkriek or Locher GlÃ¼hbier the BFM La Dragonne does not try to overwhelm you with sugary sweetness. Instead it finishes with a surprising amount of hop bitterness for a warm beverage while the aroma is mostly lead by the added spices (cinnamon, gingerbread, cardamon, maybe juniper), hiding any typical BFM flavors or most beerness for that matter. The only disappointment comes from the lack of mouthfeel on the palate. Its lack of sugar and tannins, which typically provide GlÃ¼hbier and GlÃ¼hwein with their mouthfeel leaves you with a watered down sensation between an interesting nose and a pleasant finish..."

The taste has plum, prune, figs, dates, caramel, light cinnamon and sourness. The finish is astringent and fruity. Not my fave at all for being as old as it was it was decent and interesting.

As i can remember i think the beer had been better with aging.
Ringnes Julespesial;Oslo, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Bottle, 1996 vintage. I opened up this one by curiosity, wondering how well a low ABV beer could stand the years when stored properly. It really surprised me, especially considering this is from the biggest swill-producer in the country. 13 years in the bottle hadnâ€™t cleared out all the co2, and there was a small, off-white head forming on top of the clear, dark amber body. Smell was delicious, with carmel, a light earthy touch, a pleasant oxidation, dried fruits and maybe a hint of alcohol. The flavor wasnâ€™t at the same level as the aroma, still it was nice. Caramel, cola, raisins and some generic dried fruits got company of some weak alcohol and bitterness. Medium body, feeling a bit watery maybe. Quite oily and low on co2. The finish also had some alcohol, as well as bitterness. Overall still surprisingly good, in a way maybe better than it was fresh, leading my thoughts to a watered down English-style barley wine. 090910

Aroma is slightly peaty but noticeably caramel-y. Light fruits mid palate, decent hoppage all throughout and semi sweet, soft desert like flavours near the finish. Another nice beer.
Titletown Piper Down Scottish Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Titletown Brewing Company;Thanks to murrayswine for the samples! Poured a clear, deep cola brown with little head going on. Aroma was of rich, smoky molasses and peat with ample doses of dark chocolate.. very nice! Damn tasty, too! Smoky oak and molasses at the forefront along with dark chocolate and some coffee bitterness.. could drink a lot of this! Lower carbonation allowed the flavors to deliberately make their way to the proper tastebuds.. long, smoky-sweet finish. Excellent brew!

HasserÃ¶der Ur-Bock;Wernigerode, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;HasserÃ¶der Brauerei (AB InBev);*Old rating. Best before 10.04.03. Fresh but a bit grainy sweetish beer. Not too distinctive, malty-grainy, moderate bitter in the aftertaste.
HasserÃ¶der Ur-Bock;Wernigerode, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;HasserÃ¶der Brauerei (AB InBev);Older bottle. Looks good. Like it better than the actual HasserÃ¶der design. Beer in the glass surprisingly zippy, small head. Starts strong and spicy, more and more grasy-sourish, a bit moldy. Finish milder, still a bit sourish, spicy aftertaste. Better than exspected.

No off-flavors to complain about, but the light sweetness seemed to overpower the beer, and the weak hops just couldnâ€™t keep up -- relatively speaking, of course.

Pints Pub Dark Star Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Pints Pub Brewery & Freehouse;If this beer was brewed in Britain and sold in pubs it would become a classic. All the features of a British â€™real aleâ€™ in a single mug, good and bad. Intense caramel nose supports the idea of a brown ale, the dryness in north of England but the English hopping is more assertive than most in its spiitual homeland.

Pints Pub Airedale Pale Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Pints Pub Brewery & Freehouse;The only thing that makes this an English style pale ale, is the fact that it denotes some butterscotch flavors, other than that the malt and hop profile are just like every other APA.

Big Buck Bucktoberfest;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Big Buck Brewery;Sample at the Gaylord location: Pale orange color with a continuous string of rising bubbles. Thin white head and spotty lacing. Medium-bodied with roasted malt and hops flavor. The finish is lightly hoppy and rather short. Alright as far as Oktoberfests go, pretty much on par with what you would find at most brewpubs right off the interstate.
Big Buck Bucktoberfest;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Big Buck Brewery;A very hoppy Oktoberfest, much more than I expected from its 22 IBUs (more hoppy bitterness than the brewery''s 33 IBU steam beer). Malty, a bit sticky actually. Bitterness has a slightly metallic edge. Slightly yellow on the the edge of its cream soda brown color. (on tap at the Grapevine, TX location)
Big Buck Seriously Steam Beer;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Big Buck Brewery;Awwww, I'm telling Anchor........ Light bodied, sweet malts are faint, but a nice hop presence makes it enjoyable.
Big Buck Seriously Steam Beer;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Big Buck Brewery;Good white head and decent lacing. Strong hop flavor without being too overwhelming, but highter than I personally like. Nice bubbles.
Big Buck Seriously Steam Beer;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Big Buck Brewery;MIBG Fest: Clear red-amber with lots of bubbles. Crisp carbonated body that worked well with the balanced flavour. A middle-of-the-road refresher.
Big Buck Seriously Steam Beer;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Big Buck Brewery;Golden yellow, very fizzy. Very crisp and dry and it had more hops than you normally see from the style. The finish had a lingering bitterness to it. Not bad.
Big Buck Seriously Steam Beer;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Big Buck Brewery;Incredibly curious and off-putting aroma--like that strange smell you get from the edge of a hunk of processed cheddar cheese after it has sat against the plastic packaging for too long, not exactly moldy, but soured milk and chemicals. Hints of floral, too, but not enough to make up for the smell. The flavor was much better--a pretty normal West Coast hop profile, with mild bitterness. (More mild at its listed 33 IBUs than the brewery''s Bucktoberfest at 22 IBUs.) Pale-ish dull amber. It would have been rather enjoyable if not for the aroma. (on tap at the Grapevine, TX location)
Big Buck Espresso Stout;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Big Buck Brewery;Cask-conditioned beauty! Pitch dark in color with a lasting caramel foam. Aroma is intensely like a coffee brewing in a small room at 7 a.m. It drinks smooth and rich, nicely mellow (so refreshing when a brewpub is able to do a cask, so that at least one beer isn''t carbonated to the hilt.) A solid helping of chocolate makes this taste like a chocolate-covered coffee bean, although this didn''t strike me as a particularly sweet concoction. Easy drinking, with the only criticism being that the flavor may get slightly annoying over time. Very interesting and enjoyable. (on tap at the Grapevine, TX location)

Americas Honey Wheat Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Americas Brewpub;12oz bottle 90â€™s Pours a medium golden with a small white head. Aroma of sweetness, malt, and honey. Taste of the same. This light to medium bodied brew is pretty well balanced. Not bad.
Americas Honey Wheat Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Americas Brewpub;On tap at the brewpub bar after the conclusion of the 12th Annual Drunk Monk Competition. Pint served with a hazed, light golden hue, a modest, white foam to the head, and average streaks and spots of lacing. The aroma was honey/candy sweetness, with light malt and fruit notes, maybe a hint of orange zest. The flavor was malt, light hop, and some mealy wheat or dank grain taste. Food complimentary, and sessionable.

Americas Honey Wheat Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Americas Brewpub;12 ounce bottle purchased by my parents for me from the brewpub in Aurora, IL. Poured a light golden color with a half finger width white bubbly head that disappeared quickly. It had a decent amount of carbonation also. The aroma was very bland for a wheat ale. It consisted of very light malt and some very subtle fruit hints (possibly cherry). The taste was a bit sour for my liking. It had a strange cherry tang to it with a bit very light taste of sour wheat. Overall, a very strange beer. I would not seek this out again...
Americas Honey Wheat Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Americas Brewpub;Light golden color with a small lid of white bubbles. LIght blueberry and hint of malt aromas. Seems too sweet for a honey brew. Some mild glue scents as well. Flavors of marzipan and stale almonds. Some old wheat and oat flavors as well. Iâ€™m going to finish this, but it is going to be a challenge. Some light acidity in the finish and linger. I continue to dislike this style even more after this one.
Americas Honey Wheat Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Americas Brewpub;Golden with thin white head. Honey, citrus, and mild hop aroma. Wheat, citrus, and mild honey flavour notes. Very light.
Americas Honey Wheat Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Americas Brewpub;Straw colored body with a medium white head. Aroma is sweet and a bit skunky. I can smell the honey, but thereâ€™s almost a spoiled scent to it. Medium, oily palate up front leads to to higher carbonation and bite towards the end. The flavor is pretty bland. Honey and malt with a touch of hoppy bitterness. Not impressed.

Americas Honey Wheat Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Americas Brewpub;12 oz. bottle, no freshness date, the breweryâ€™s website currently lists the ABV as 5.4%, sampled in a pint glass. L: Unfiltered hazy, orangey straw golden with a billowy white head that slowly settled into a sudsy skim. The head retention on this wheat ale is quite good. Minimal amount of splotchy lace at the top of the glass. S: Raw barley grains and wheat malts, flowery, namely orange blossoms, touches of lemon and honey, notes of herbal hops as well. Mellow, but pleasantly flavorful smelling nose on this APWA, the aroma of a hot summer afternoon quaffer. F&T: Soft carbonation gives the light body a mildly firm and slightly creamy feel in the mouth, Americaâ€™s Honey Wheat Ale is a smooth and easy drinker. Mellifluously sweet tastes of orange, lemon and honey, backed by pale malts and a gentle wheat twang. A delicate hop spiciness comes out in the finish. Finishes softly clean with just a briefly lingering lemon honey aftertaste. Honey Wheat Ale is a pretty decent American Pale Wheat Ale, fills the bill while watching baseball on this sunny and humid summer day.

Americas Reindeer Red Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Americas Brewpub;"Right off the bat I notice an overwhelming aroma of buttered popcorn. It was not a good thing. mixed with the caramelly malts it got a bit better, but then showed up in a big way while consuming too and that was a big big turn off. Too powerful to overcome. Wasnâ€™t horrible as I went along, but didnâ€™t reach my ""good beer"" standard either."
Americas Reindeer Red Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Americas Brewpub;Tap: This pours a deep amber body with a sustained, good lacing head. The aroma and flavor are sweet caramel, toast, toffee, and some apples and pears. The light hop presence keeps the sweetness from getting overwhelming. Sessionable. Americaâ€™s Brewpub, Aurora, IL
RJ Le Cheval Blanc Sainte Paix MÃ»res;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasseurs RJ;(660ml Bottle) I was very intrigued by this beer since I did not know that it exists - I had tried the apple and cherry. Pour a cloudy, strawberry body and virtually no head. Aroma of berries but I wouldn't be able to tell without the picture of the blackberries on the label and because it is partially masked by its highly carbonated, soda pop style. Tastes of more of a tart, young red wine with a medium sour finish as opposed to a seasonal beer. No comparison to a lambic but nice for a spring day like today.
RJ Le Cheval Blanc Sainte Paix MÃ»res;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasseurs RJ;Originally brewed in apple and cherry versions, this is a blackberry (mÃ»res) varation on Cheval Blanc's Sainte-Paix. I haven't tried either of the others, but I wasn't too impressed with this one. The first pouring from the bottle was overly bubbly, and lacked in flavour or complexity. It just tasted like a light lager cut with a little bit of blackberry juice. The second half of the bottle started out a little more interesting, as I stirred up the yeast and poured it along with the beer, giving it more flavour - but the yeast and blackberry soon combined into an unpleasant medicine flavour. Bleah.

Ultrablonde 8%;Ecaussinnes, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;ScÃ¥ssenes (previously Ecaussinnes);Cette ultrablonde de la brasserie ScÃ¥ssenes est une biÃ¨re plutÃ´t plaisante, sur une amertume agrÃ©able sans quâ€™elle en soit cependant particuliÃ¨rement intÃ©ressante. En bref, de quoi passer une bonne soirÃ©e avec des amis en Ã©tÃ©. En verre, lâ€™ultrablonde est blond dorÃ© (EBC aux environs de 21) avec une mousse blanche dâ€™un centimÃ¨tre environ. Le nez est frais, sur le houblon avec des arÃ´mes floraux, fruitÃ©s (pomme, poire et une pointe citronnÃ©e) et de miel. Lâ€™attaque, souple et sur un bon Ã©quilibre malt/houblon est avant tout floral, sur les cÃ©rÃ©ales mais avec une pointe dâ€™aciditÃ© citronnÃ©e. La deuxiÃ¨me bouche est lÃ©gÃ¨rement plus amÃ¨re, florale avec des arÃ´mes de pÃªche en complÃ©ment. Lâ€™arriÃ¨re bouche quant Ã  elle prÃ©sente une amertume plus saillante avec des notes de coriandre. La troisiÃ¨me bouche, linÃ©aire, prÃ©cÃ¨de un final relativement long sur une amertume saillante et agrÃ©able. Lâ€™alcool, progressif, est bien dosÃ© Ã  lâ€™instar du sucre, et la corpulence, quant Ã  elle est moyenne. Un bon moment tout de mÃªme. Il faut savoir se contenter des choses simples quelquefois.

Snuffelbeer;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Regenboog;Nog een boekje gevonden van de 24 uur van het belgische bier in de oude beurs in Antwerpen in 2002 waar ik dit bier geprobeerd heb. Ondertussen bestaat het bier blijkbaar niet meer, maar ik heb er toen bijgezet: kleur tussen donkerblond en amber, zeer lekkere geur en lekkere (iets zurige) smaak
Snuffelbeer;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Regenboog;One of the old Regenboog beers which went extinct when the brewery was closed down (and replaced by another one). A spicy, fruity, sweetish â€™edelbierâ€™ with warm orange blond colour, toasted bread, red berries, yeasty, smooth maltiness, supple and fruity, with grassy hops in the finish. A bit different.

Snuffelbeer;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Regenboog;Bottle conditioned, ZBF 2004. Amber gold, moderate white head and moderate condition. Low malt and high wild yeast notes (intentional?). Fruity tart in the mouth with more wild yeast that becomes chemical like. Tart fruity finish with traces of spice. Suspiciously like an infected beer.
Snuffelbeer;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Regenboog;An amber beer with not head. The aroma is sour as if it is infected - or is it just the spices, but also malt sweetness. The flavor is sweet in the beginning from malt and caramel, but then again sour as if it is infected.
Snuffelbeer;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Regenboog;"Amber; white head, fast gone. Spicey nose (which I KNOW - not identify - to be paradise seed) on top of crystal malt. Bit over-burnt smell. Sourish taste, once more sloeberry-like, but quite clean & crisp. Extremely refreshing - perfect palate-cleaner. Rather light-bodied. Strange, but well worth looking for. Normally only at the YH in Brugge."
Lombardus;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Regenboog;Obviously aged sample, +/- 4 yrs Initially frothing head, gone in seconds, leaving unclear yellow beer, resembling cider. Yeasty & estery nose, fresh-smelling, peppery, lemony or lemongrass, even some Brett! (a lot of aged Regenboog beers sport this), ironoxide (though not in the head, obviously), organic acids, fruity. Good deal of fruity acidity in the taste, bit lactic, much less spicey than the nose. Lemony or wild prunes ( quetches ), sweet (or rather sourish?) woodruff. Retronasal even more flowery notes. Thinnish MF, because of the acidity, but has kept oxydation at bay. Strange, but rather pleasant flavours. I get Michaelsâ€™ lemon, but not his tea. Thanks to the brewer himself for supply! This bottle is better than remembered on draught at the 24h.
Lombardus;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Regenboog;Milky blond with a small head. Weak aroma. Tea and lemon flavour. Well balanced but a rather short taste.
Pandreitje;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Regenboog;"A layered palate; interestingly so. Chalky, dusty but with some smooth elements too, this is an easy to drink beer. Earthy, muted coriander and surprisingly mellow caramel. Nice burnished brown. Natural. Hint of honey (or in all of Regenboog by default?). Lovely little beer."
Pandreitje;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Regenboog;Hazy orange. Lacy head. Nose of coriandre, spicey, herbal, lactic. Diacetyl just at identification level. coriandre, lots of malt and malt sugar. Dense mouthfeel, more than expected, but the palate is 'fade'. OK, but nothing to rave about.

Het Anker Gouden Carolus Christmas/NoÃ«l;Mechelen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij Het Anker;Of the several brews brought home from my recent The Netherlands/Belgium visit, Christmas/Noel will be the first opened and sampled. I tilt the 33 cl bottle into my Trappistes Rochefort glass to discover an amber-brown body completed by a determined egg brown top of finely-bubbled foam. The nose is apparent and delightful, toffee, brown sugar, malt and sour dough bread. I pause before drinking, but not too long. Delightful again, dates, caramel, wheat bread, cherries and a nice surrounding bitterness. Gouden Carolus does it again for me. Bravo.

Achilles Serafijn Donker;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Microbrouwerij Achilles;18-May-12 (750-ml bottle) This beer is surprisingly sweet, right from the first sip, with flavors of brown sugar and cinnamon. It's very malty and caramely, but even more fruity, with ripe, red apple, raisin, date, and fig dominating. The dried fruits, sugars, and sweet, caramely malts are just as apparent in the nose too. Full bodied, partially from sugar, with moderate carbonation and a somewhat cloying mouthfeel after awhile. Hazy, ruddy, dark-amber body is capped by nearly an inch of bubbly, light-tan head that fizzes away fairly rapidly. Overall, though quite tasty, the sweetness really becomes overbearing after several sips, so it's a tough beer to consume in one sitting, and since it's a 750-ml bottle, it's a chore I'm having difficulty completing.

Boerke Donker;Dilbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Angerik;Bottle. Pours an orange-copper body with a small fluffy white head and airy lace.

Creamy, light brown head, which never completely vanishes but remains afloat on top of the beer. Lightly tart and metallic nose. Dry, lightly roasted malt, with pronounced tart undertones and a dry, lightly bitter finish. Vinous with a rather light body. Reminds me of the old style I believe is called ""Vlaams bruin"". Unusual but very delicate. 080605"

On Tap! Raspberry Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;On Tap! Bistro & Brewery;Reddish-amber color with a large but fast dissipating white head. Tart raspberry, hop aroma with a mild malt undertone. Flavor is initial malt, quickly giving way to an underripe raspberry and bitter hoppy taste. Long sour/bitter finish.

On Tap! Raspberry Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;On Tap! Bistro & Brewery;A dirty golden color to this one which also provides a moderately nice amount of head.

Barnsley IPA;Blackpool, Lancashire, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blackpool;First tasted this at the Renfrew Beer Festival in September 1997. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear amber in colour with a thin white head. Dusty hops in the short floral aroma. Thin mouthfeel and poor lacing. Pale malts give a juicy citric bite of grapefruit and lemon peel. Dusty hop resins give a dry bitterness to the short aftertaste. Finish is again bitter and dry. An ok session IPA but better examples out there.

Barnsley IPA;Blackpool, Lancashire, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blackpool;A fairly straightforward pale amber coloured best bitter. Crisp, clean and noticeably bitter.

[2.8] Feb, 2004: The Great Wenlock Meet Up. Slight orange flavour. Not much going on. [2.8] Feb, 2005: Cats Back, Wandsworth. Delightful fresh and hoppy. Lingering hop finish. A spanking good ale.

Woodfordes Headcracker;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Woodfordes;Hand pull cask at the Olde Sun, St Neots. Light golden brown, slightly cloudy. A reasonable amount of natural carbonation leaves an off-white ring of head around the beer. Light aroma of cereal, tangerine peel and white grape. I expected it to taste sweeter. Instead it is dominated by a somewhat harsh bitter-sour with citrus overtones.body is medium to thick. Flatter mouthfeel than the appearance would suggest. Good but surprisingly little character for the ABV.

Church End Nuns Ale;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Church End Brewery;Bottle (bottle conditioned) from Stirchley Wines & Spirits, Pershore Road, Birmingham. This may have been classed as a bitter but Iâ€™d say it is more of a golden ale. Pours a clear amber with sediment. Nice head with a decent lifespan. Faint, citrus aroma with some fruity hops. Poor mouthfeel - too fizzy for my tastes and more in line with a pale lager. Taste is initially bitter but soon gives way to sweetness and a huge shot of citrus. Decent session/barbeque ale but not at all memorable.

Younger of Alloa Sweetheart Stout;Glasgow, Scotland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wellpark (Tennent Caledonian - C&C Group);Darkest brown with a tan foamy head. It looks really good. Insanely sugary. Like candy floss. Plenty caramel malt with a dusty sensation. Comes across like a sweet malted milk drink. It's fruity too. Such a sweet finish with surprisingly decent medium body. Moderate carbonation. So sweet it's crazy. Easy drinking though.

Younger of Alloa Sweetheart Stout;Glasgow, Scotland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wellpark (Tennent Caledonian - C&C Group);July 2018 - Cheap-looking 500ml can picked up in Keith and consumed there also. As 'Younger of Alloa Sweetheart Stout', 2%. Darkest brown or black with a red hue, big dense pillowy brown head. Aroma is earthy, quite airy, bourbon biscuit, rusted metal. Body is frothy with soft carbonation. Taste is quite sweet, flat cola, watery and sugary with no bitterness. It has a relatively pleasant flavour I suppose but it doesn't taste like beer. Just very very sweet. I think they 'hopped' this with sugar but I can see why this beer hasn't died a death - the sweetness might appeal to some. (4-4-5-3-10=2.6)
Younger of Alloa Sweetheart Stout;Glasgow, Scotland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wellpark (Tennent Caledonian - C&C Group);Sweet hear stout as has been mentioned does not try to be anything but just that!

Younger of Alloa Sweetheart Stout;Glasgow, Scotland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wellpark (Tennent Caledonian - C&C Group);"Just what it claims to be .a SWEET stout low alcohol stout. .its only 2 %.

Dunno where the ""its too sweet "" or ""too low in alcohol""comes from...drink and enjoy it. tan head that dissipates with a wee bit of malty sweetness. not bad for 2% in my opinion"
Younger of Alloa Sweetheart Stout;Glasgow, Scotland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wellpark (Tennent Caledonian - C&C Group);.5 L can retrieved from Scotland and served in an Ayinger glass. Dark brown body is opaque in the glass. The overly fizzy head is short lived. Poor, unappealing aroma. The flavor is better but overly sweet. Exceptionally thin body. Overall: poor but drinkable and only 2% ABV.
Younger of Alloa Sweetheart Stout;Glasgow, Scotland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wellpark (Tennent Caledonian - C&C Group);Can from Tesco, Corby. Very sweet for a stout, and so much so that thereâ€™s very little â€™stoutâ€™ about it. Dark clear brown with no head.

Younger of Alloa Sweetheart Stout;Glasgow, Scotland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wellpark (Tennent Caledonian - C&C Group);0.5L can. Deep red color, small amount of tan head. Burnt sugar nose, honey, biscuits, hint of metal. And then on to the taste: Sweet, sweet, ultra sweet. Not easy to pick out the flavors, but tiny hints of spice and metal are coming through the massive wall of sugar. Watery, thin mouthfeel, low carbonation. Probably one of the worst beers Iâ€™ve tried.

Tampa Bay Bavarian Pilsner;Tampa, Florida, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tampa Bay Brewing Co.;On tap @ brewery. Pours a watery looking clear gold with decent enough bright white head. The aroma is very light with vague sweetness and a faint floral hop note. The taste starts sweet and malty from lightly roasted malts. Then the floral hops grow in strength and mix with the sweetness. This mixture seems to create an almost soapy flavor. The hops gradually become more and more bitter toward the finish. I still sense a slight soapiness into the after taste. It may just be the malt and hop combination creating this flavor on my palate. As more and more ounces are consumed a nice malty flavor starts to shine through and tipping the balance of sweet malts and hops away from that bit of soapiness I sensed.
Tampa Bay Bavarian Pilsner;Tampa, Florida, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tampa Bay Brewing Co.;Hazy gold with a small white head.

Like a hearty beer. Oddly good. Flavor is rich and fairly dark, pretty roasted but with a biscuity finish. I thought it was gonna be dry but itâ€™s not at all. Itâ€™s really decent and full body for an amber. I dig it.
Tampa Bay Red Eye (Redeye) Amber Ale;Tampa, Florida, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tampa Bay Brewing Co.;Sample at the brewpub. Pours a clear orange-amber color with a medium thin off-white head that dissipates quickly to an outer ring. Spotty lacing. Aroma of malt, caramel and slight hops. Light-bodied with flavors of pale malt, caramel and grassy hops. The finish is sweet with a short malty aftertaste. Slightly above average overall.

Pours a lightly hazed gold with a medium sized white head. Soft musky wheat on the nose, a light bit of yeast. After I chewed up the lime wedge I was ready to go on this. A touch of lemony grain. Better than the pils in terms of drinkabality, soft musk and wheat into the finish. Pleasant enough.

RÃ©servoir Blanche;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;RÃ©servoir - Brasseur;Cloudy yellow body topped by a long lasting white-head. Generic witbier. Wheat and cirtrus aroma, wheat and citrus taste. Very watery body but after all, the place is called the Reservoir!!!. They must have changed the recipe because I seem to remember a bit more complexity (coriander and other spices). The pint I had was very boring and generic, the type of bland beer one could expect from a place like Les 3 Brasseurs. Iâ€™ll wait a few months and give it another try. Draft at brewpub.

Cheewy, caramelly middle with plenty of malts present. Light citric orange and spiced, dry hops to finish. A very drinkable beer, which seems to be more of a lightly hopped pale ale than a wheat to me. A great session brew.
RÃ©servoir AmbrÃ©e de BlÃ©;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Wheat Ale;RÃ©servoir - Brasseur;Draft... Murky, deep amber ale with a small, frothy, off-white head. Fruity, spicy aroma. Fruity flavor with mild sweetness and light bitterness. Notes of citrus, pear, apple and banana. Medium-bodied and creamy with adequate carbonation. Finishes very lightly bitter, spicy and dry.

Some wheat, a little bit caramel and a whole lot of water. Could have used some hops. Very watery. I understand the brewpub rent must be expensive at this prime location near the trendy St-Laurent street in Montreal, but do they really have to water-down the beer?!?!?

RÃ©servoir AmbrÃ©e de BlÃ©;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Wheat Ale;RÃ©servoir - Brasseur;The beer at this pub is a black mack on the great brewpub name of out city. The amber wheat, a favorite among regulars Iâ€™m told, is no exception. Pours a cloudy lightly carbonated drab coper, thin white head that forms a tiny island of sludgy foam that floats till the glass is empty. The nose is slightly bubble gum and salt water, but itâ€™s very light. The mouthfeel is milky and overly wet. Taste is dominated by green wheat and bubblegum, some sour milk, and little else. Aftertaste is creamy toffie. All this and they served it to me in a shaker. Feh.
RÃ©servoir AmbrÃ©e de BlÃ©;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Wheat Ale;RÃ©servoir - Brasseur;(Draught) Half-pint ($4) purchased at the Reservoir Brewpub on November 4, 2005. Pours a thin, white, foamy and quick dissipating head with a cloudy orange body. No nose. Milky, past-due sour cream. Butterscotch finish. God awful... FYI: Reservoir = Montrealâ€™s Black Sheep Brewpub. Poor quality. Poor service.
RÃ©servoir AmbrÃ©e de BlÃ©;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Wheat Ale;RÃ©servoir - Brasseur;Opaque and amber, with only a ring of lace circling my glass. Aroma is quite wheaty, with a witbier yeastiness, but it also had acidic twang that Iâ€™m fairly certain was an infection of some kind. Iâ€™m pretty sure the brewer here isnâ€™t messing with Brett, at least not purposefully. Soggy wheaties and bread, with a hint of spice that reminds me of Coup de Grisou, a local buckwheat hefe made by Cheval Blanc. However the infection showed up again in the taste, and was again a little too light. I know this type of Beer isnâ€™t supposed to be too round in the mouth, but this one just had something lacking.

Alchimiste Weizen;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;341ml bottle. Cloudy blond with a head that is gone before you halfway done, unless youâ€™re very thirsty. Does not have that banana-fruity aroma that I expect from a weizen. Instead I got this spicy acid citrus grapefruit taste. This beer, like half the people I know is below average.
Alchimiste Weizen;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;bottle. Hazy yellow-golden colour with a small white head and lace. Aroma is predominately pepper and clove with emphasis on yeast...there is also light notes of lemon. Flavour has a reasonable amount of fruit but itâ€™s mostly spices. Quenching body with a dry finish. Not a whole lot going on and nothing to get excited about but itâ€™s a decent simple weizen.
Alchimiste Weizen;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Sampled on-tap at Vices & Versa Appearance: Honeycomb yellow, clowdy, with a thick frothy head that held itâ€™s own for a while. Smell: I was expecting a lot more banana. I found it amongst the grainy aroma, but I really, really had to look. Taste: You can taste the wheat up front, than a mix of bitterness and acidity, and the finish is malty sweet. Not a bad Weizen, but not a great one either.

I think they made it for fall season. It also came in a tester pack with all the other EphemÃ¨re brews. Had a great peach nose and taste. Was cloudy and light orange colour with a white head. I wish they would bring this one back.
Unibroue Ã‰phÃ©mÃ¨re PÃªche / Peach;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Unibroue (Sapporo);not a huge fan of this one decent peach nose and flavour but a tad too sweet refreshing should have had in the summer decent tartness so as not to over do the peach

Cascade Four Seasons Summer Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);OLD NOTES DEC 10, 2004 Light citrusy hops and malt nose, pours golden with foamy white head. Light malt body with a bit of hoppiness. Apparently this is suppose to be a wheat beer? Nothing outstanding at all really.
Cascade Four Seasons Summer Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);1st year this came out it was a great beer but from thn on it went down hill tastes like water from the derwent river give it a miss its not a wheat beer more a golden lager not impressed by the local drop
Cascade Four Seasons Summer Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);To me this displayed none of the charaacterisitics that I associate with a wheat beer, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Poured crystal clear amber gold with a nice head that flattened into a lacy ring for the duration. I found no citrus or fruit characters at all in the aroma, only wet vegetation and malt. The palate is a nicely rounded light malt, slightly sweet, with grassy hops a pleasantly noticable presence. A great summer golden ale, but not a wheat beer in my books.
Cascade Four Seasons Summer Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Bottled. Straw colur, clear, near no head. Grapefruity cascade hop aroma. Sweet and orangey with rounded mouthfeel and light wheat malt character. The hope contribute more to aroma than bitterness. I find this beer pretty pleasant, and well balanced as far as summer beers go.
Cascade Four Seasons Summer Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Lightweight seasonal wheat beer. It pours a light lemon colour with a fleeting head. Very fizzy-looking. Odd, uninviting nose with some sour uric notes. A light, effervescent champagne-like body that ultimately feels insubstantial. Some citric notes and barely-there hoppiness. Essentially characterless, with none of the flavour and body of a good European wheat beer. One of the weaker links in the â€™Four Seasonsâ€™ range. (2003, bottle)
Cascade Four Seasons Summer Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Tasted from the bottle. Poured a crystal clear, pale straw body with big odd bubbles that failed to form a head ( had minimal lacing ). No aroma, like trying to scent aroma from an Evian bottle! Light bodied inside, slightly acrid sour notes, citric cordial flavours and orange & lemon peel hints on the palate. Not at all a wheat beer and let alone flavoursome, nothing more than another forgettable macro-brewed â€™Aussieâ€™ beer!!!
Cascade Four Seasons Summer Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle: Clear light gold with a foamy white head. Cittrussy and grassy aroma, some melon and background malts (faint though). Hop dominant flavour but a little weak. Also very noticable sulphur flavours in the beginning. Soft carbonation and light bitterness. Nice enough, but bland (summer seems to mean bland in Australian beer language).
Cascade Four Seasons Summer Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Clear, light and fruity. Small head no lacing, long bitterness. No noticeable aroma. Very cold though. Too thirsty for it to warm up.
Cascade Four Seasons Summer Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);A very nice light wheat beer that is perfectly suited to a hot Australian afternoon. The hops aroma is crisp and refreshing, as is the light taste of wheat. When itâ€™s 40Â° outside and the beerâ€™s 4Â°, itâ€™s perfect.
Cascade Four Seasons Summer Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);I can only assume that what this brewery is trying to tell me is that in summer people like to drink beer that has no flavour. Boring as hell, but without fault. Slight sweetness is the only distinguising feature. Drinkable yes, interesting hell no.

Taps Alt;Tustin, California, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Taps Brewery & Barrel Room;A: The pour is a light brown color with a thin layer of white foam. S: The nose doesnâ€™t have too much going on. The caramel and toasted biscuit malt aromas are pretty much the extent of things. T: The flavor was similarly one-dimensional. Mostly toasted and caramel malts with perhaps a touch of spicy hops. There really wasnâ€™t much to this beer, unfortunately. M: The body is medium with a slightly creaminess to the feel on the tongue. D: This is a rather bland and one-dimensional beer that just didnâ€™t do much for me.

Draft on 11-12-05. Gold bodied witha small white head. Nose is malty and bready with a light sulphur/egg note. Kind of unappetizing. Taste is better with chewy malts, light lemon notes and grass. SOme sourdough bread hints as well. Body is light with a mild carbonation feel. Finishes with more bread notes, malts, light grass and a hint of citrus. OK, I guess.
John Harvards Munich Helles;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On draght at Framingham loc. on 9/22/2005 with OldGrowth. Freshly brewed on 9/20/2005, so it didnt have being old as an excuse. But an excuse it needed. Pours a ridiculously clear, filtered to all get out light yellow. No head or lacing, much resembling BMC, though not as much fizzy carbonation and perhaps not quite as light in color. Smells like a cheap, German knock off. You can smell the yeast biproduct and I know they used a German-style yeast strain, but itâ€™s just smells, powdery, dusty, corny, papery and altogether unpleasant. Yikes. Flavor is at least, somewhat better than the aroma would let on. Watered down German lager yeast has no bite left in it, with touches of light pale grains, corn-like notes and a watery, poor body which gets even worse after it warms. Barely perceptible hoppiness, maybe a touch of watered down grassiness. Iâ€™ve definitely had worse versions, but this is still pretty bad.
John Harvards Munich Helles;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap in Framingham. Clear golden orange color, minimal head. Aroma of wet hay and pale malts, assorted grains. Mild flavor overall, has a pleasant malt finish. Not bad, but just average altogether.
John Harvards Munich Helles;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap at Framingham location: Poured golden yellow with a medium white head. Mild aroma of vinegar and corn with a little fruit. More corn in the palate. Okay.
John Harvards Holiday Red;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Notes from 2006 - Monroeville location. +++ Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a mahogany color with a small tan head. The aroma was faint sweet malts with a pleasant vague fruity presence. The flavor was sweet and tangy with a nice malty presence and faint fruity hops. Medium length hoppy finish. Pleasant.
John Harvards Holiday Red;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Draft at Union Station, identified as an American ESB with 5.6% ABV. Beige head atop clear dark amber body. Aroma is medium sweet, orange/floral, some caramel/bread, light spicy, strawberry. Taste is medium sweet, orange/floral, spicy, some bread, caramel. Light-medium body, light stickiness.
John Harvards Holiday Red;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Growler filled at the Lake Grove, NY location. Pours a clear dark reddish amber with a moderate off-white head that lasted through the first quarter of the glass and left just a bit of spotty lace. Pleasant aroma of malt and just a hint of chocolate. The flavor is exactly the same as the aroma with malt and just the barest hint of chocolate. Very lightly bitter at the finish. I am not sure what makes this a holiday ale, but it is a decent enough beer anyway.
John Harvards Holiday Red;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sweet with notes of caramel and maybe a drop of cherry. Light, not meduim bodied like in the Providence discription. A little bitter, a little watery wheat taste also.
John Harvards Holiday Red;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Lake Grove listed as Holiday Red. Poured a dark red brown color with a beige head. Light chocolate and nutty malt aroma. The aroma was dry. The flavor was malty with nutty notes. Light sweetnes with a hint of fruit. Dry finish. Medium bodied.
John Harvards Holiday Red;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Draft at Manchester, CT location. Light aroma, not much of a head, nice red color. A little earthiness and very little bit of hops in the nose. Rather watery and light in the mouth. Small amount of caramel maltiness balanced by an equally small amount of grassy hops. Not repugnant, but not mind-blowing either. Easy to drink and goes well with a full meal, which what theyâ€™re after.
John Harvards Holiday Red;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Ok lighter weight style. Soem faint roasted notes lurk, adding complexity. Clean, filtered, fizzy notes detract from the flavour.
John Harvards Holiday Red;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Hmmm. Was expecting more. I was a bit taken off by the watery texture of the beer. Yes there was malt and hopps present and a little candy like sweetness. A mellow and quafable beer but unremarkable.
John Harvards Holiday Red;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Dark red in color, decent lacy head, not much by way of flavors as the beer seemed a bit bland, a bit of a sweet malty profile & aftertaste, certainly not one of the better holiday seasonal beers out there
John Harvards Holiday Red;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Draft in Pittsburgh, PA. Clear coppery red. Barely an edge head. Light carbonation. Lightly sweet with a smack of Belgian yeast initially. Light malt base and a buried alcohol presence. Minimal hop aroma and flavor. Basically an Irish Red made with Belgian yeast. Decent seasonal.
Maribo Julebryg;Maribo, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Maribo Bryghus (Royal Unibrew);Warm amber with an OK head. The aroma has notes of malt and sweetness, and the flavour is sweetish, malty and is slightly roasted. Itâ€™s mellow and rather well balanced. But a great experience - noooooo!
Maribo Julebryg;Maribo, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Maribo Bryghus (Royal Unibrew);Bottle. Amberish colour with a short lasting bubbly head. Sweet maltish aroma, which also appears in the flavour though more sweet. Served too warm so it was a bit nasty. Though my thanks to Janne for getting this brew.

Maribo Julebryg;Maribo, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Maribo Bryghus (Royal Unibrew);Bottle. Pours dark amber with an off-white head. Sweetish aroma, slightly hoppy. Lots of apple. â€“ I usually like the apple-thing, but this seems overdone â€“ as if the beer hadnâ€™t matured long enough. Flavour is sweetish with apple notes and cereals in the background. Dryish finish. 12-01-06.
Maribo Julebryg;Maribo, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Maribo Bryghus (Royal Unibrew);(Bottle 33 cl) Nice, golden brown beer without much head. Not much immediate aroma, but lovely soft and pleasant flavours of some slightly roasted malt and caramel. Not much bitterness to speak of. Very harmonious and easy-to-drink Christmas-beer although perhaps not the most characterful. 311099
Maribo Julebryg;Maribo, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Maribo Bryghus (Royal Unibrew);An amber beer with a caramel colored beutiful head. The aroma is sweet caramel with slight sour notes. And so is the flavor, which also contains notes of bread. An OK cheap christmas beer.

Tenaya Creek Oktoberfest;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Tenaya Creek Brewery;22 oxz bomber from Total Wine. How this beer could miss so many marks is beyond me. Funky, musty aroma bordering on sour. taste is overly sweet malt, cooked vegetables. Just off and nasty all the way around. I had hoped for much better.
Tenaya Creek Oktoberfest;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Tenaya Creek Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Clear yellow pour with a white head. Mild lager bouquet. Nice malty notes dominate. Light and and refreshing.
Tenaya Creek Oktoberfest;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Tenaya Creek Brewery;"""Suckered into this premium price beer (for a marzen anyway 40 cents an ounce is a bit much) because Iâ€™m wanting to try EVERY new Oktoberfest beer I see this year. This was ok, but not a great traditional example of the style. Not very rich and a little too bitter. In the end, the toasted malts and caramel were pleasant, but it wasnâ€™t enough."""
Tenaya Creek Oktoberfest;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Tenaya Creek Brewery;"(bottle) clear orange amber colour with a medium tall white head; aroma of stewed fruit, then honey; somewhat unusual, intense flavour- bit chemical, with a long medium bitter finish"
Tenaya Creek Oktoberfest;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Pint on tap. Dark gold color, clear, light head. Aroma is disappointing, not what I was expecting for the style, kind of flat. Taste is confused, I think this beer has an identity crisis--itâ€™s simultaneously a not good example of the style and not good in general. I donâ€™t know what it is, frankly. Hoppy but not fresh really. Get a Paulaner Oktoberfest MÃ¤rzen instead.
Tenaya Creek Oktoberfest;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Tenaya Creek Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Pours a clear gold with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has bread through out that grows in sweetness with a bit of cereal. Flavor is a combination of bread and cereal that are slightly sweet.
Tenaya Creek Oktoberfest;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Tenaya Creek Brewery;On tap at brewery poured a clear amber hue w/ med fully diminishing white head. Medium malty aromas. Initial flavor light sweet w/ a med bitter finish. Tastes are bread, caramel, and rye. Creamy mouthfeel and a dryness in the finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Harpers Milk Stout;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harpers Brewing Company;On the board as Lake Effect Stout. This a really sweet stout. The pour is a lighter dark brown, no real head, and no lacing to speak of. The smell is really sweet, with some hints of chocolate, and maybe a little coffee. The taste is even sweeter, with some of the coffee and chocolate coming in as an afterthought. Not very well executed, and it doesn't linger very well. Not a good beer ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Harpers Milk Stout;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harpers Brewing Company;Listed on the menu as Coletteâ€™s Stout and described as a sweet stout. however, it seems extremely dry to me with substantial chocolate malts -- no sweetness at all. decent, but not exactly what was described by the menu.
Harpers Milk Stout;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harpers Brewing Company;On tap at Harperâ€™s. Deep brown body, medium tan head. Chocolatey, roasty aroma with sweet notes. Rich, creamy, full body with roasted malts and chocolate opening up to a complex, deep sweetness characteristic of the best cream stouts. Appropriate depth of body to carry the array of flavors. Smooth, quaffable, and well-done.
Harpers Milk Stout;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harpers Brewing Company;Black body with small, quickly fading head. The aroma is sweet chocolate and roasted notes. The flavor was sweet cream, chocolate and coffee. Body was slightly on the thin side, but overall a nice milk stout.
Harpers Milk Stout;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harpers Brewing Company;Really pretty impressive. Brewpub stouts can be hit or miss and this one was a nice surprise, a direct hit, especially with the creaminess and soft roasted taste. I usually don''t like strongly roasty stouts and this one was tasteful, unlike Sean''s rating of it.
Harpers Milk Stout;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harpers Brewing Company;A sophisticated presentation - swirling deep browns and a lovely dark head and a gentle mouth feel, soft and full as a woman''s breast. OK, maybe that''s getting carried away, but it was a pleasant texture, and nice accents of licorice, roast, and well creamed coffee in the flavour. A good, lighter stout.

Ortliebs Sanatoga Stout;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout;Ortliebs Brewery & Grille at Sunnybrook Ballroom;Excellent stout, I think this is the best beer they had (at least at the time of this writing), basically black in color with an off-white head, the soft & lacy head followed the stout all the way down the glass, very rich flavors, a bit on the dry side, a hint of roasted coffee in the flavors & the aftertaste, overall a very good stout
Joshua Huddys Porter;Toms River, New Jersey, United States;Porter;Joshua Huddys Brewery;It's been a few years, but I just came across the notes on this stuff. Foul looking, flat Mug root beer appearance. Touch of hops and roast on nose. Sip: this is not beer. I ask the bartender for something else because this porter tastes completely awful. Has a pretty watery mouthfeel that won't go away...or is that my mouth trying to reject the bitter poison I just tasted?
Joshua Huddys Porter;Toms River, New Jersey, United States;Porter;Joshua Huddys Brewery;I had never been to a brewpub that offered me standard American Lagers before offering their home brews... until now. And with good reason. Their porter is the thinnest, weakest excuse for a porter I have ever tasted. Pass this one by and hit Basil T''s instead.

Nutty finish with a medium body.
Mill Creek ESB;Walla Walla, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mill Creek Brewpub;Bright golden-amber. Huge caramel/brown sugar aroma. Sweet, slightly fruity palate.

Nose of light PNW hops, sweet husky crystal malts and an earthy body. The flavor is very sweet with a touch of bitterness and lots of herbal hop qualities.

Mill Creek IPA;Walla Walla, Washington, United States;IPA;Mill Creek Brewpub;Draught in a flight at the brewpub. Pours a clear amber color with a moderate white head on it. Nose has some nice floral hoppy elements to it. Taste is definitely bitter, but tastes like the hops are going bad, as I get some bits of isovaleric acid to it. Meh.
Mill Creek IPA;Walla Walla, Washington, United States;IPA;Mill Creek Brewpub;filtered caramel rust body. zingy hop bitterness with astoundingly awful tasting malt sweetness. it seems like nothing more than amber malt extract and hop pellets: chewy, sweet and buttery with caustic cheese rind hop bitterness. awful.
Mill Creek IPA;Walla Walla, Washington, United States;IPA;Mill Creek Brewpub;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a rather dark hazy amber-orange, with a thin slick in white. Generic cascade aroma, quiet. Flavor is a bit ugly. Really sweet and riddled with old hop, wet dog, buttery, cheesy isovaleric character. Ugh. Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ll be able to handle this whole pint. Tongue-smacking bitterness is rough and chewy. Some high estery fruit coming of the yeast alcohols on the back end. This is tough.

Bethlehem Brew Works Belgian Paradise;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fegley's Brew Works;Sort of generally Belgian, a light golden ale with a persistent head. It was served a tad colder than I think it should have been, and as soon as it got warm enough for the flavor to really blossom out, my bacon cheeseburger arrived, which totally messed up my palate (they use good smoky bacon at the Brew Works restaurant.) Thus it gets lower flavor and palate marks than it probably should. All in all, though, it''s very good, and I agree with Setanta about the vague-tending-toward-saison style. There''s no way this could be mistaken for a non-Belgian style, but it''s be hard to really say which Belgian was intended.
Bethlehem Brew Works Belgian Paradise;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fegley's Brew Works;Not sure what style... I would say close to a saison, but a moderately strong ale none the less

Fegley's Brew Works Bagpipers Scotch Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fegley's Brew Works;"THOUGHTS: Very nice. Very malty and fairly complex â€” especially in the aroma. It would go nice with some Christmas cookies. Hid alcohol very well. Got slightly cloying halfway through. TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark, reddish brown that was nearly black in the glass with bright, red highlights and a large, off-white head that mostly diminished. It also had tiny particles of average to thick density floating in the body. The aroma had heavy dark bread, molasses, caramel, chocolate and chocolate syrup; light roasted malt; cherry; toffee; butterscotch; brown sugar; maple syrup; cola and hints of vanilla. The initial flavor was light to mod sweet, ever so slightly sour and lightly acidic; while the finish was heavily sweet, ever so slightly sour and slightly bitter. There was cherry, caramel, maple syrup, molasses, cola, hints of vanilla, brown sugar, chocolate, toffee and butterscotch. The medium to full body was a bit syrupy and then a little dry with fairly soft carbonation and a light alcoholic finish."

Portsmouth Brewing Pilsner;Portsmouth, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Portsmouth Brewing;Nice find, bottle at kroger! $1.25 Hazy pale like a wit bier. Smell is of fresh cut hay. Very smooth refreshing and bubbly, much better than expected considering all those astringent beers out there that call themselves pilsner. Yes, so much carbonation, lovely, effervescence. One of the better beers in feel on my palate in a long time, so cutting. Taste is almost tart but never quite gets there, right on the threshold of tart and wheatie. This the kind of beer I wouldnâ€™t mind in a 24 can case. Yummy, civilized overall beer drinking experience, nice job Portsmouth. Lovely refreshing stuff fer sure! Does not possess any of that rude sharp astringent bitterness so common with contemporary pilsners. I think this just may be my highest rated pilsner above Erie Brewing Hard Cock Pilsner, Bavik Premium Pils, Carlsberg Pilsner, Warsteiner Premium Verum, New England Elm City Pilsner or even Brixton Michael Pilsener, pretty good stuff! Big thanks to kroger and portsmouth for this random encounter. No lie! This Pilsner ROCKS! Iâ€™m liking this bullshit! Not like most american or domestic wannah beez!

Anyway, this vienna was deep golden, very malty and rather sweet with a fresh hop accent. It was well rounded and nearly buttery with low bitterness, and way better than any other lager I've found in Turkey.

Barrel House Dechagas Scotch Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Barrel House Brewing Company;Bottle, from trade with JCW. Good nose, Little maple, molasses, toffee. Reminds me of a barley pop or the smell of mash. Clean orangy red color, nice head that faded. Sweet flavors, like the aromas little coffee in there, alot like mash. Little metallic bite in there. Medium body, oily creamy mouthfeel, sweet, some bitter bite, sticky finish. Man thatâ€™s a great beer. Unlike any Scotch ale Iâ€™ve had. None of that peaty earthy funk I associate with the catagory. Damn good. If this is 8.5% i canâ€™t notice. Thanks JCW

Barrel House Dechagas Scotch Ale;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Barrel House Brewing Company;I agree with Dogbrick on this one. I go to Barrel House a fair amount and I've never been too impress. Scotchish Ales in general aren't my style, but I really liked this one. It was sweet with a heavy taste of barley. Big in alcohol, but I could in no why taste it. Excellent beer!

Tinima Superior;CamagÃ¼ey, Cuba;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Tinima;Really bad. Adjuncts-a-plenty. Really sweet and fizzy, it reminded me a hell of a lot of cheap Aussie lagers, which made me homesick.
Tinima Superior;CamagÃ¼ey, Cuba;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Tinima;Sparkling lager with a lightly hopped aroma, and a sweet/dryly finished flavour. A reasonable lager.
Tinima Superior;CamagÃ¼ey, Cuba;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Tinima;"Don't tell the State Department that I bought a bottle of this while in London, but I suppose I can always claim I did it under the ""academic research"" exemption. What I learned was that it was a lesson in the influence of adjuncts on beer. Fizzy white head. Corn flavors, characteristically sweet like many international lagers. In truth, while clearly bad beer, it had a flavor that I don't particularly mind and it went well enough with friends and dinner. And who are we kidding, this is a beer worth trying only to tick another country off the list."
Tinima Superior;CamagÃ¼ey, Cuba;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Tinima;Bottled. Gold, poor head and moderate condition. Foul aromas of crap, smoke and mothballs, soft and unsettlingly dissolving in the mouth. Slight chalkiness, although that may just be the enamel being stripped from your teeth. Justifies the US boycott of Cuba in a mouthful.
Tinima Superior;CamagÃ¼ey, Cuba;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Tinima;"Smells sweet and malty and also a bit ""off"". This is a clear, golden beer that looks very still, amazing considering how fizzy and bloating it is. Flavours are..not evident. The slight sourness on the finish is the best aspect of this beer. Pretty hopeless. Castro probably forces this on his citizens."
Tinima Superior;CamagÃ¼ey, Cuba;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Tinima;"Tinima is the largest of the six breweries in Cuba, and is undergoing modernisation to keep up with the demand in Europe for this slimey cheap cereal lager. Splashed on the label are the words ""Cerveza de Cuba"" over an evocative picture of palms trees against a blue sky. No doubt if they put a picture of Fidel Castro's beard on the back they would triple production. It started off well - a soft creamy first mouthful with hints of butter. But as the carbonation dies down so the flavour fizzles away leaving a taste of corn starch and a metallic tang of cheap hops."
Tinima Superior;CamagÃ¼ey, Cuba;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Tinima;Bottled. Pale golden. Corn aroma. Light bodied, very bready. Low bitterness. Drinkable, but certainly nothing special.
Tinima Superior;CamagÃ¼ey, Cuba;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Tinima;Hard to describe this one. At first it reminded me of liquid cardboard but after a while it started to taste a little nicer. Tastes like a pils that has gone wrong.There must be a lot of reasons to visit Cuba but this isn't one of them.
Tinima Superior;CamagÃ¼ey, Cuba;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Tinima;Phew - smells like canned corn. Hazy anemic gold color and a fizzy head. Cardboard aftertaste and water. Worthless.

Das Bier sollte man, wie bei allen Weizenbockbieren, ans Ende einer Bierprobe setzen, da der Nachgeschmack, sehr lange anhÃ¤lt. Dieser ist hier recht dunkelmalzig und leicht herb anklingend.

Snipes Mountain Harvest Ale;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;My favorite aspect of a harvest ale is the graininess that gives images of a fresh harvest - seems reasonable. It may be in part due to my Eastern Washington upbringing (land of wheat and barley). This was a tasty beer, but frighteningly sparse in respect to this Harvest Ale necessity as I see it. Fresh hops dominate, and although I respect the mentality that a harvest of hops is just as important as a grain harvest, I wish the malt was a touch stronger.
Snipes Mountain Harvest Ale;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;Starts off with a hoppy nose of cascade hops. In the body, malt starts to come into play and then a played out dry grainy malty finish. Waaaayyy too hoppy for the style.

North By Northwest Holiday Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Strong Ale - English;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Listed as an English Barleywine. The beer pours a hazy dark reddish brown color with a tan head. The aroma is very heavy on the dark fruit and some very sweet malt. The flavor is similar with some added notes. I get a lot of brown sugar from the malt as well as some piney hops, dark fruit and some alcohol. The beer is fairly boozy, but less so than some other barleywines. The predominant flavor is brown sugar. Medium mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation.

North By Northwest Holiday Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Strong Ale - English;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;750mL bottle courtesy of slimchill poured into a tulip. Pours a murky caramel orange with small floaties in the first pour underneath a small head of big bubbles that recedes to a small collar and left some delicate lacing. The aroma is musky but sweet with lots of apple and pear sweetness with a healthy dose of bready malts as well. There are hints of spices, maybe cinnamon and pepper. The taste has an interesting spicy kick up front before the big light fruit sweetness comes on with apples mainly and a hint of floral sweetness. The spices come back in the finish with a slight peppery dryness. The mouthfeel is very slick with low carbonation - drinks almost like a cask ale. This is a very interesting beer from NXNW with lots of fruity sweetness battling with an herbal spiciness throughout. Certainly worth a try and very original.

Bitter End Pumpkin Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Other;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Yep, another entry from The Bitter End...I love using the form to the right and being the first! It''s another pumpkin ale, consumed a few days after Buffalo Bills, which was my first pumpkin ale ever. To tell the truth, I couldn''t taste too much difference between the two, except this one might have a slightly more prominent pumpkin flavor and maybe a bit more spiciness. Still a good novelty beer, I''ll drink one every October. Gets a bit minty toward the finish as it warms up.

The white head with slight pink highlighting is average initial, retains on the modest side, and there is some light lacing present. The nose is raspberry jam, seeds, caramel malts really ; I thought this one came across as a really nice drinker, and one of the better fruit beers I had, in spite of the fact that the base beer is on the boring side. Raspberry comes through in a natural , non artificial way here, and this brew drinks clean and bright, with more raspberry jam, mild tart, medium sweet, caramel, bread, and light bitter - I enjoyed it."

The fruit is further balanced by some really nice wheat aromas...The taste sadly is a huge letdown those nice raspberries turn here into some generic and stale and reminds of another crappy stawberry beer that just canâ€™t be done right. too sweet, generic, with a weird aftertaste. A poor fruit wheat beer thatâ€™s not worth trying.

Maisels Weisse Wintertraum;Bayreuth, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Gebr. Maisel Bayreuth;"500ml bottle, from BeersOfEurope. 5.7%. Murky tan/orange colour with a head that quickly went awol. Quite citric lemony aroma with some confected bubblegum notes. Palate is also lemony, but sweetish too. Fairly fruity but doesnâ€™t have much estery banana character. Mouthfeel is prickly, but thin, with sharp edges on the finish.

I suppose I expected something a bit more from a ""special"" winter version, so it ended up seeming rather lightweight and lacking in presence. Palatable enough but not really what I was expecting."

Maisels Weisse Wintertraum;Bayreuth, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Gebr.

Peoples Pint Scotch Ale;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Peoples Pint;Bottle from Table and Vine. Dark reddish brown with lasting ring and some lace. Woody boozy roasted caramel aroma. Sweet roasted caramel and ashy wood with some fruit and brown sugar. Roasted nutty woody bitterness with linering ashy smoke. Medium-full body, low carbo. Excellent interpretation of the style. Way underrated. Iâ€™ll bet there a dozens of cherry-cough-syrup Scotch ales rated higher than this.
Peoples Pint Scotch Ale;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Peoples Pint;22oz bottle. Pours a dark reddish brown with a thick creamy tan head. Fairly average scotch ale. Sweet malty flavors with a hint of smoke. Not bad, not great.
Peoples Pint Scotch Ale;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Peoples Pint;22 oz. bottle shared by shareanevada (notes from 2010). Pours a clear copper brown color with a small beige head. The aroma and flavor had sweet malts, some smoky, mild peat notes, light dark fruits with some earthy bitterness. The flavor was a bit watered down tasting.
Peoples Pint Scotch Ale;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Peoples Pint;On tap at the brewery. Pours deep brown with a lacy head.

Peoples Pint Scotch Ale;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Peoples Pint;22 oz. directly from the brew pub. Deep ruby color with no head or lacing. Nose is smoky peat with dark fruit and light chocolate. Lots of smokiness in the flavor with a light smoked meat flavor. Sweet malt comes up toward the finish. The smoke and sweetness complaints each other well. Medium in body. Itâ€™s ok.
Peoples Pint Scotch Ale;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Peoples Pint;Bottled. Poured brown. Smallish head. Smoky peaty aromas. Some malty tastes. It was ok.
Peoples Pint Scotch Ale;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Peoples Pint;On tap at the brewpub. Iâ€™m not sure how this Scotch Ale accumulated so much bitterness, but I found it off-putting. The smokiness was unnoticeable. Malt structure, otherwise, was quite good, but I couldnâ€™t get past a terse, harsh bitterness that was very up front.
Peoples Pint Scotch Ale;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Peoples Pint;At table and vine beer tasting, smoky, they used peated malts straight from Scotland and it shows. Awesome character added to a complex intricate scotch ale. The best beer at the beer tasting hands down. Great job!
Peoples Pint Scotch Ale;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Peoples Pint;The aroma consists of caramel and toffee, with an essence of smokiness. The beer pours a dark brown, but its consistency and lack of lacing leads to a watery appearance. The flavor is dominated by the astringency of ethyl alcohol. A slight smokiness is noticeable, along with notes of roasted malts, but the jejune nature of the ale makes it overall uninteresting.
Peoples Pint Scotch Ale;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Peoples Pint;Bottle. Poured a clear dark reddiish brown color with a moderate frothy brown head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted malt and earthy hop aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy toasted sweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Solid complex drinkable brew.
Peoples Pint Farmer Brown;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Peoples Pint;From Oct 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with Yamar18. Thanks Kevin! Big pop on opening the 22oz bottle but no gushing. Big 3 finger head of foam with good sticky lacing and dark brown with reddish hues in colour. The smell...well..it doesn't smell like the typical English Brown Ale. I'm getting a lot of citrus and not much else. What is going on here? The taste is all citrus but not bitter...it definitely leans heavily toward the sour side and everything else that could be there is overwhelmed. Weird. I love sour beers but, frankly, not in Brown Ales. I also get some notes of pepper and a slight malty taste that just pops in once in a while and disappears as quickly as it showed up. I don't think I held on to this bottle longer than I should but maybe I did. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation is medium. Nice combo but this brew is difficult to drink for me. I can't recommend it as it is.

Peoples Pint Farmer Brown;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Peoples Pint;Just ok. Head fades nearly immediately. Pretty bland taste. Lots of malt and not much else.
Peoples Pint Farmer Brown;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Peoples Pint;A decent example of an American Brown Ale of which there are very few. Low IBU is sufficient to balance the mild malt sweetness. Taste does not linger into the next sip.

Peoples Pint Farmer Brown;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Peoples Pint;22 ounce bottle. Not a bad brown ale for a chilly and dark autumn afternoon. While brown ales are not among my favorite types of beer, this one is a commendable representation of the category. Nice dark color, white frothy head, and a malty finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Peoples Pint Imperial Stout;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Peoples Pint;Vintage 2010, Bottle #31 A half inch of mocha foam falls quickly over this black ale. There remains a ring of said foam. No lace. Smells of leather, anise, molasses, alcohol and some hints of apple. Iâ€™m happy with this. I would suspect this to taste like a toned down aged Nightstalker. Sweet with bitter bite. Thereâ€™s a hop presence to this still and reminds me of some of the hop profiles in some ABAâ€™s. I like it as itâ€™s a little spicy and a little meaty. Theres a certain nitrite flavor to this beer. Some dark malts, hint of blackstrap and some graham as well. Medium on heavy with low carb. i would argue a little more carb would go a long way to help open this beer up. Alcohol is not notable on the flavor. I liked this beer. I think, based on reviews, I would enjoy this beer with another year, or at least an â€™09 as the reviews on the â€™09 are pretty stellar. Serving type: bottle 01-19-2012
Peoples Pint Imperial Stout;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Peoples Pint;22 oz. bottle 2012 vintage. Black liquid with fleeting tan head. Aroma is a burst of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. The flavor is more of the same with coffee, chocolate and roasted malt. Still has noticeable alcohol notes which really shocked me after nearly 12 months of cellar. I guess it should have sat another year? Maybe I built this up in my mind because it wasnâ€™t mind blowing in the flavor department. Good and drinkable but nothing that I have to run to Western MA to get again.

Peoples Pint Imperial Stout;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Peoples Pint;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a large sized head of foamy light brown colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a semi-opaque dark ruby red brown colored body and a thick foamy lacing. .

A decent one that I would consider drinking again.

Peoples Pint Imperial Stout;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Peoples Pint;Vintage 2009 Bottle #135 The beer is a near black shade, with a finger of tan head that generates some decent lacing upon the glass. The aroma is enticing, with some nice chocolate notes and a healthy roast presence. The flavor is not quite as enjoyable as the aroma would indicate. There is a dark fruit presence to accompany the roasted malt and dark chocolate flavors. The beer is medium bodied, with alcohol presence fairly tame.

Thomas Hooker Irish Red Ale;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;From Dec 2007 I got this bottle in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! This beer pours from 12oz bottle a clear deep amber with a good 2 finger head of foam and lots of sticky lacing. The smell is of roasted and caramel malt and is nice on the nose.I can also smell just a touch of hops. The taste is very nice. Roasted malt and good caramel sweetness offset by a nice mild hop bite in the background make for a very tasty, smooth, and easy drinking Red Ale. Oh, there's a touch of chocolate(?) in the flavour that I wasn't anticipating. Very nice indeed. It has a medium mouthfeel and the carbonation is also medium. This certainly isn't your run of the mill example of the style! Very good stuff!
Thomas Hooker Irish Red Ale;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Poured into a mug, the appearance was a ruddy burnt amber color with a fingerâ€™s worth of off white foamy head. Sly messy lace. The aroma had some grassy hops, nice caramel malt base, some bready/biscuity sweetness. Sly earthiness. The flavor melds the earthiness to the grassy hops. Malt base is there to balance sweetly. Rugged malt aftertaste. Semi-dry malty finish. On the palate, good session, nice feel, not too sticky on my tongue. Good carbonation. Overall, nice Irish red ale, willing to have again.
Thomas Hooker Irish Red Ale;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Drank at Cooperâ€™s Seafood House in Scranton, PA. Pours a beautiful red color with nice lacing head. A bit of a hoppy aroma for a red ale, but great on flavor.

Satcheu;Kortrijk-Bellegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Facon;One of the beers the late brewery Facon, which was situated close to the language barrier between Flanders and Wallonia, used to make for Wallonian commissioners. Vintage tasted at 8 years of age, from a 75 cl bottle. Coarse, loose, off-white head, pale brownish peach blond colour, hazy. Spicy yeastiness in the nose along with restrained fruit, dried orange peel, peach, apple, ginger, wine vinegar, whisky, but all very subdued. Neutral onset with lightly sweetish touch, some dried fruits, pretty strong carbonation, soft and grainy basis, yeasty and spicy, thin and somewhat watery finish (I assume the hops had desintegrated a bit already). Still very drinkable but clearly not a beer which aged well - so anyone still possessing a bottle today, better use it for cooking or something...

Satcheu;Kortrijk-Bellegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Facon;"Hazy copper color. Has aged (at least 3 years) without suffering too much; but it seems to be a simple one, quite dry mouthfeel, a bit spicy and woody, maybe too short final."

Kastaar;Peizegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Block Brouwerij;Bottle. Pours clear blonde, Ok to small whtie head. Smell is sweet,malty but also got some different characters I donâ€™t really recognize. Taste is intense, yet elegant yeastyness with fruity aspects ( not overripe fruit ) a fine fruity hoparoma as well that pairs nothing less than perfectly with the rather aromatic yeast. Light level of bitterness, yet the bitterness is there. Lovely in balance. Even though tripels will never be my favorite beerstyle, this one deffinately is worthy of being called very good !
Kastaar;Peizegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Block Brouwerij;Bottle at home. Pours a deep golden colour with a white head that soon disappears. Very slight aroma of orangey hop. Taste is sweet to start, then slightly bitter. Slight citrus taste, thin finish. OK at best.
Tun Tavern Grand Cru;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Tun Tavern;"Pours flat, opaque orange, with no head at all. I donâ€™t know if this bottle is bad, or if itâ€™s brewed that way. Bourbon aging, honey and alcohol are very evident in the aroma, along with little of the spiciness. Starts with a sweet bite. A little spicy, but fruity, alcohol, and barrel aging are overpowering. The spiciness and bourbon give it a complexity, but not in an interesting way. The more i drank, the more I got a dirty apple peel taste. If I ever doubted what the word """"cloying"""" meant, I donâ€™t anymore."
Tun Tavern Grand Cru;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Tun Tavern;this kinda sucks, it reminds me of my childhood. it smells like a shoe store and tastes like and old boot full of apples beer and god knows what. thick and cloying and rough.
Tun Tavern Grand Cru;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Tun Tavern;Grand Cru 10th Anniversary-750ml bottle@Joeâ€™s NYC Gathering that I brought courtesy of Timâ€“pours a disappearing white head with copper color.

Tun Tavern Grand Cru;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Tun Tavern;Deep garnet-orange beer. Thin head. Aroma is very sweet and chewy. Honey and toasted almonds and barley. A touch of treacly honeyish sweetness. Peachy and tropical but way underattenuated. Sticky and sugary. Itâ€™s not good, but Iâ€™ve had worse.
Tun Tavern Grand Cru;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Tun Tavern;Bottle at JoeMcPheeâ€™s. Pours a amber body with an off white head. A/F very bozzy, with a sweet malty sugar backbone. Some ginger spice. Not for me.
Tun Tavern Grand Cru;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Tun Tavern;Bottle: Headless copper beer. Sweet nose with lots of honey and diacetyl. Slick alcoholic feel. Very sweet with honey, ginger cookie and candi-sugar. Too sweet.
Tun Tavern Grand Cru;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Tun Tavern;My understanding of Grand Cru means best. Iâ€™ve been to Tun Tavern and although the beers are close to solid, this beer shouldnâ€™t be in the same room with anything named Grand. The apple flavor dominates followed with Belgian sugar.
Tun Tavern Grand Cru;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Tun Tavern;1/2 gallon growler. Radiant yellowed copper. Small, dense off white head. Specks of carbonation. Honeyed aroma, toasty malts, pineapple syrup and a touch of juniper. Rich, smooth and faintly carbonated with a layered fruity, honeyed sweetness melding with a toasty malt base and Belgian yeast overlay. Medium thick body. Rich sweetness, even ice cold. Mild spiciness lingers in the aftertaste, with a soft, savory edge. Hint of cherry, atop the dominant Munich malt base, late. Finishes lighter in body but not in flavor with a surge of spicy alcohol and fruity sweetness. A very respectable, and downright quaffable, version.
Tun Tavern Grand Cru;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Tun Tavern;Crimson in color with a dissapearing thin, almost soapy looking off-white head. Aromas of candy sugar and pepper. Strong peppery flavors and some fruity characteristics as well. One of Tun''s more complex brews, Bravo!

Black Label 11-11 Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Got this ultimate whale and a few other ticks from Crossovert. Thanks Mike! This is oxidized and sweet but not hideous considering its advanced age. It lacks bitterness and is fairly smooth... for a malt liquor that is many years old at this point. I guess we can call this a small victory for quality control in larger breweries.
Black Label 11-11 Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;40. BB 2013. It is oxidized but smooth, still not a pleasurable malt whale experience. Iâ€™m all for them bringing this back though.
Black Label 11-11 Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Boom! Big ass 40 of this bull shit. I must say, 5-6% malt liquors arenâ€™t my favorite and this is no exception. Brown paper bag in appearance as suggested. Corny, sweet, almost cloying. Not really my thing, seemed stale as well. Thatâ€™s what I get for trading with BA guys I guess (just kidding ralph)
Black Label 11-11 Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;From the 40 oz bottle. Nice crack on the twist cap. Oh come on RB reviewers, it is not THAT bad. It pours pale yellow with fizzy carbonation. The aroma is decently malted but not corny or grainy like so many of its counterparts. The body is thin. The taste does have a corn and rice note to it but it is also lightly hopped to end crisp and clean. It was not great but it was not horrible at all.
Black Label 11-11 Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;The Lindsay Lohan of beers: Really nice can but when you open the mouth out pours filth and bile. Strongest metallic taste Iâ€™ve ever experienced in a liquid. Color is better than most crap beers but thatâ€™s where my complements end. Smells bad, head lasts about 1.2 seconds, churns in your belly like lukewarm moonshine. Maybe I got a bad batch but I wonâ€™t be venturing into this wasteland again to find out. Go elsewhere for your American swill my friends.

Black Label 11-11 Malt Liquor;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;"Oh, gawd. Ugh. Ick. Worse than death. I gave this a shot, thinking, for some reason, that it might be an ok but not great low budget brew. Little did I know who actually makes it. It doesnâ€™t even say on the outside of the 12-pack box. It only says on the cans themselves. Anyway... DId I say ""oh, gawd"" already? This crap really actually honestly is the worst ""beer"" Iâ€™ve ever tried. It is terrible in every way that you can imagine beer being terrible, and a few more you canâ€™t. I would rather drink Steel Reserve or Olde English or Evil Eye, etc... They all taste only slightly better, but at least they wait until the next morning to give you a hangover. Honestly this swill is TOXIC. Yes ok, technically, ethanol is poisonous. But if you disregard ethanol and just consider the rest of what is in this... concoction, seriously it is POISONOUS. If you want a very decent and non-poisonous beer thatâ€™s easy on your budget, try Huber Bock. You will not find another beer that tastes even half as good, and is not filled with aldehydes, for the same price as Huber Bock. Trust me, it is the ultimate budget beer. (P.S. - I took a chance on this Black Label crap because the store did not carry my beloved Huber. I wish I could have this day back. I would gladly just skip the beer entirely.)"
Pump House Premium Lager;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pump House Brewery;Modest head and clear dark gold body. Smells of wet cardboard, some people might like sucking on cardboard but Iâ€™ve always found it a little tedious. Flavour is heavy cloying sugar with vague malt hints. Like wow, a boring lager is hard to mess up but this is a mess. Malt liquor flavours should not be jumping into my head but there they are.... there. they. are.

Pump House Premium Lager;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pump House Brewery;Bright dark straw, almost gold color, with some powerful activity. White 2 finger head with good retention that last for 5 to 10 minutes, with a nice amount of legs. Aromas of sweet grains and burnt sugar with a faint floral and lemony feel. Flavors of zesty citrus, roasted malt, faint caramel, floral and herbal spices. A little grassy and quite floral. Nice sweetness and great sharpness. Slick medium body with super prickly carbonation. Light and short finish, ending with a sugary roasted malt feel, faint noble spices, and hint of lemon lingering on the tongue. Overall a very good quality craft. Good flavors and very refreshing, while the carbonation is a little excessive. Good balance but feels a little light. At last, a good lager! No adjunct feel, the way a real lager should always taste.
Pump House Premium Lager;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pump House Brewery;"Can purchased at the brewpub. Nice dark golden colour with a thin white head that sticks around. Aroma is on the sweet side - sugary cereal grain with hint of corn, although the can indicates itâ€™s an all-malt beer. A slight herbal note to indicate there are some hops, but sweetness dominates. The flavour has a bit more balance to it - still too sweet and grainy for my personal taste, but a hit of herbal and grassy hops in the finish. Sticky on the palate. All in all - average, and not especially ""Premium""."

Decent bitter that is balanced with the hops and malt, but aroma and taste were too muted for me.
TwoRows Nostradominator;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Fairly heavy and sweet like most TwoRows beers. Another variation on their similar tasting dark brews. I will take it on $1 pint night with no problems. Goes well with crawfish.
TwoRows Nostradominator;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;"A step up from their other ""bocks"". This beer is like a typical ""amber"" beer that you would find in an american brewpub. Nothing too special, just a malty flavor with an aftertaste that sticks for a minute or so....bleh."
TwoRows Nostradominator;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Amber, clear, slight hop spice. Better than the Penalty Bock and the Belair Bock, but this place really should quit trying to make bocks. Not much to this except some nice maltiness toward the finish.
TwoRows Nostradominator;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;RERATE: Small, weak head, weak aroma. However, better than I remember it from last time. Dark amber-brown color, very strong tasting, almost a hint of alcohol. Slioght fruitiness, Overall better than some of their other beers.
New Albanian Community Dark;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Mild Ale;New Albanian Brewing Company;On tap at New Albanian, pours a deep dark brown with a reddish tinge and a small beige head. Aroma brings out English malt, light burnt notes, and toasted crusty bread. Flavour is along the same lines, with burnt crusty bread and English malt. Not exactly true to style, but at least itâ€™s rather assertive. Decent.

Aromas of mild coffee, stone fruit, and pale malt. Flavors of light roast coffee, dark chocolate, and yellow plum. Cleansing mineral finish. Decent amount of body considering the alcohol level.

New Albanian Community Dark;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Mild Ale;New Albanian Brewing Company;on tap @ New Albanian / New Albany IN --- Clear dark r4uby brown, beige head cover, dots of lace. Taste is dark malt with light caramel. Light carbonation is added on the swallow, then light hops in a finish that slowly slides back to caramel. This is a good all-night brew.
New Albanian Community Dark;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Mild Ale;New Albanian Brewing Company;Another long time want. Nailed it. Pours a dark, dark brown to black with a voluminous huge froth of mocha head that settles to leave a wall of tight lacing. Nose involves toasted malt, woody hops, and some light roasted coffee. Lightly sweet, somewhat bitter. Light, airy body, creamy texture, soft carb, with a toasty toward dry finish. Another damn near perfect session brew that I wish was on draft in the north part of the state on occasion. Thanks Broad Ripple for having this as a guest tap.

New Albanian Community Dark;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Mild Ale;New Albanian Brewing Company;Not one of the better NABC beers. No aroma and tastes a little flat. Still drinkable at the flea.
New Albanian Community Dark;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Mild Ale;New Albanian Brewing Company;Malty aroma with a little bit of cocoa. Malt forward flavor. Medium body. Not too complex but a decent beer.
New Albanian Community Dark;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Mild Ale;New Albanian Brewing Company;5 oz sample draft at the New Albanian Pizzeria and Public House in New Albany, Indiana. The pour is a darker copper golden with a smallish off white head. The aroma is roast, nuttiness, grass and a bit pine. Nice soft, full, natural nose. The taste has all of the elements of the nose balanced and integrated nicely together. Lightly sweet, nutty, grassy pine, and soft roast to the finish. Fresh, a bunch of character for a mild. The palate has great body, light, easy drinking. Fresh, clean and really tasty. Great mild - highlight of the night.
Haerlemsch Herfstbock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;Bottled. Reddish brown coloured. Quite spicy aroma and flavour. Very nice and rather sharp herbal bitterness in the flavour.
Haerlemsch Herfstbock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;(Bottle 30 cl) Muddy, dark orangey golden. rather neat off-white head. Pronounced acidity as with otther strong Dutch beers. Diacetyl and a lot of yeasty esters, without being unpleasant. Dry bitterness and very warming alcohol. OK but not overly refined. 050405
Haerlemsch Herfstbock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;Bitter special. Bitter. The first couples of zips are nice, but afterwards it gets sickening. Quite brutal beer.
Haerlemsch Herfstbock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;"The aroma is very spicy with noticable cowberries. The color is a hazy red and it has a beutiful beige head though collapsing. The flavor is lovely; spicy and sweet. A nice beer. I wonder what went wrong with the beers the first four samplers have had."
Haerlemsch Herfstbock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;First of all: appearance. Let's have a look at the bottle instead of the beer. A copied label, which is hardly readible, because of being copy #345. The beer itself pours a cloudy orange brown color, with a short frothy head, not the nicest of appearances. The aroma is of metallic malts, yeast and alcohol. It resembles my first homebrew project, which did not turn out too well. I can taste sweet malts, alcohol is quite well hidden, nice biologic solution Joris. The palate is thick, sticky, alcoholic. If anyone sees this in stores, leave it there. It's not worth the try.
Haerlemsch Herfstbock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;Lactic and spices aroma. Cloudy, orange/brown color, off-white head, fair lace. Lactic but this is covered by all the spices, light sweet, light bitter, alcohol well hidden, medium body.
Haerlemsch Herfstbock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;Explosive gushing, spewing forth the meanest grey-brown blobs of yeast (I hope!) I ever saw in such a small bottle. Stupendous yellow-brown head, full of... I wish I knew what speckles - then again, maybe rather not... Dark red-brown beer. Nose: lactic acid, phenoles, spices, flowery notes, cidery. Taste: vinous, but with a cloying-sweetish taint under the aggressive tarty-spiced malts. God, this is UNBELIEVABLE. Palate: thick. Ruined. The alcohol is partly consumed by the pediococci, I presume, who are now having a ball. This is third-in-a-row, it's getting obvious: these guys are amateurs, and ought not to sell before they get their act right.
Haerlemsch Herfstbock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;Aroma has glue. Yeasty taste with glue, cream, chewing gum and alcohol. Hints of roasted malt. Full bodied beer, but too amateuristic to make a real impression.

Jantjes Hemelrijk Wit;Uden, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Jantjes Bierbrouwerij;@Burg bieren, wazig amber met schuimige witte kraag. aroma komt niet erg binnen, of het wordt overruled door de BBQ die ik net aangestoken had. wat wel te herkennen was waren tonen van citrus, bloemen, mout en zoetigheid. smaken zijn redelijk zoet, zwak bitter, zwak fruitig , aardse mouten, koriander, tarwe, zwakke body, dun en glad van textuur, lage co2, maar al met al krijg ik er niet een echt witbier ervaring bij.
Jantjes Hemelrijk Wit;Uden, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Jantjes Bierbrouwerij;Draught @ Burg bieren. Opaque orange color, small white head. Smell and taste malts, lightly sweet, some caramel surprisingly. Dry finish, a bit watery texture, low to average body and average carbonation.
Jantjes Hemelrijk Wit;Uden, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Jantjes Bierbrouwerij;From previous rating it appears this beer fluctuates a bit. I found the appearance does not resemble a classic wheat (wit) beer. It poured amber with good white head but very little wheat present. Scent is typical â€™earthyâ€™ Belgian wheat and similar to â€™t Ij Wit. Flavour is quite clean for a wit, not very citrussy but pleasant. Label mentions elderflower but struggle to detect that. Overall a pleasant witbeer, but not memorable.
Jantjes Hemelrijk Wit;Uden, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Jantjes Bierbrouwerij;Dark yellow/orange with an even head. Brew is interesting but not yet fully developed. The fruits give a good tart sourness to it, the aftertaste is yet somehow dissappointing. Bottle from Burg Bieren Ermelo.
Jantjes Hemelrijk Wit;Uden, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Jantjes Bierbrouwerij;Bottle, courtesy of fonefan. A clear, golden beer with some floaties and a small, off-white to white head. Not entirely clean aroma, some milky unpleasant notes blend with lemon, spice notes and cellar hints. The flavor isnâ€™t much better, worse actually. Medium body, dead and papery. It ends like the initial flavor, far from good. Wonâ€™t miss this one. 110128

Dragonmead Jul Ã˜l;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Dragonmead Brewery;I am a fan of Scandanavian style beers, a good variation onthe Belgians spiced and dark. This was brown with some lace. Like a barleywine and old ale. Didnâ€™t get that much of spice, but there is clove and ginger and cardommon thrown together. Enjoyed at the brewpub. Carbonation and mouthfeel they got right.

Chocolate start and roasted finish. Quite pleasant. Lively in the palate. Medium body, light for the style.

Dragonmead Reverend Freds Oatmeal Stout;Warren, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Dragonmead Brewery;From notes. Finally getting around to adding beers from the Ypsi Summer Beerfest! Enjoyed on July 25. The pour is a nice light black with a decent dark khaki head ans some light lacing as it recedes. The aroma is heavy on the roasted malt. There is a nice chocolate bit and itâ€™s definitely got some good oat qualities. The flavor is much of the same. Much more oaty than I was expecting. The roast on it is really good. I love the bitter chocolate, but this is definitely an oatmeal stout. The mouth feel is very creamy with a nice carbonation and a lingeringly dry roasty aftertaste. Definitely a solid brew.
Dragonmead Reverend Freds Oatmeal Stout;Warren, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Dragonmead Brewery;Had on-tap at Dragonmead. Appearance: Well, what is there to say? Thick, creamy-as-hell tan head that stays on top of the beer. Thick wall of lacing. One of the best beers Iâ€™ve had, visually. Dat nitro-tap! Smell: Hm. Yeah, thatâ€™s nice. Light, but pleasant. Coffee and toffee/caramel sort of aromas are there though. Whatâ€™s there is really good. Taste/feel: Taste is much like the smell. Coffee, toffee/caramel. Basic. Light. Easy drinking. The obvious comparison is Foundersâ€™ Oatmeal Stout. Thatâ€™s a better beer, but not by too much. Simply put, that beer just has a bit more flavor. The look and feel of this one though are excellent. A well-made Oatmeal Stout. Iâ€™d like some more flavor, but what IS in here is tasty. Iâ€™d have it again for sure.

Dragonmead Reverend Freds Oatmeal Stout;Warren, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Dragonmead Brewery;"Tap: Very black color, completely opaque with a fuzzy, dark-khaki colored head. Aroma consists of roasted malts with maybe a touch of smoked malt, too; oats and grains abound, along with a hint of woodiness and a slight mocha-java vibe. The taste has a good dose of roasted malts with a burnt and slightly smokey profile. Dark coffee beans, bitter chocolate, and heavy, heavy oats. The oat flavor is explosive. Dry, rustic oats coat the palate, also giving plenty of almost wheaty, grainy flavor. No much hoppage; bitterness comes from the roast. Very creamy, nice carbonation."

Dragonmead Lils Grumpkin Pumpkin;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Orange amber color with a foamy beige head and a big nose of pumpkin pie spice. The smell reminded me of momâ€™s pumpkin cookies. Taste of cininmon, clove, pie spice and a white sugar sweetness. Palate is so dry you can almost taste the powder of the spices. A little light in body, and not enough beer here to support the spices. But I still like this style for an Autumn treat.
Dragonmead Lils Grumpkin Pumpkin;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Dragonmead Brewery;Tap: Pours amber with little head. Aroma was spiced pumpkin pie almost like the yankee candle. Little pumpkin flavor and really strong spice. Overall very smooth pumpkin ale.

Pours a mostly clear gold with a thin white head that faded into a scummy looking film after the first sip and left no lace. Faint aroma of malt and grassy hops. The flavor is a little bit better with a bit of malt up front followed by some grassy hops. Mildly bitter at the finish. This is not an offensive beer, but it certainly is a boring one.
Stone Coast Sunday River Lager;Bethel, Maine, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Pretty good lager. Smooth with a nice malty sweetness and perfectly balanced spicy hop bitterness. Appears to be unfiltered. Fairly straightforward stuff, but enjoyable nonetheless. 12oz. bottle.
Stone Coast Sunday River Lager;Bethel, Maine, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;12oz bottle. Poured a medium and hazy amber color with a small sized head. Aromas of toasted malts, grains, honey comb, and lightly bready. Tastes of toasted grains, bready, and had a grassy finish. Not bad for a pale lager.
Stone Coast Sunday River Lager;Bethel, Maine, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;(bottle - 12 oz) Straw gold in color with a fizzy white head. Aroma is a light and balanced mixture of sweet malts, dry grass, hops, and honey. Flavor has a strong hop presence that gives way to a smooth and malty middle and a crisp and slightly hoppy, bitter finish. Thin-bodied.
Stone Coast Sunday River Lager;Bethel, Maine, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;A Decent Lager. Pours with a good inch of head that becomes lathered. Aroma is balanced, if a little understated. Mouthfeel is good and flavor is a little bitter but overall balanced by the hops. Easy drinking and overall enjoyable.

Buckeye Old Mammoth Stout;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Buckeye Brewing Company;Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a black color with a large foamy dark tan head that lingered and left minimal lacing. The aroma was dryish with coffee, wood and smoke. The flavor was semi dry with wood, brewed coffee, a bit of roasty malts, cream and a hint of smoke. Long finish. Moderately full bodied and smooth. Fairly well made but not my style.
Buckeye Old Mammoth Stout;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Buckeye Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy of Zach at Andyâ€™s New Yearâ€™s Par-tay! Pours a deep black with a fairly large dense mocha head. Roast and plum and sweet cocoa. Medium bodied, cocoa and chocolate. A bit of oxidization, cocoa and plum. Long roast and bitterness into the finish. Dusty bitter chocolate on the finish.
Buckeye Old Mammoth Stout;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Buckeye Brewing Company;Opaque black pour with a tall, creamy, long lasting tan head. Coffee, cocoa, dark roast malts in the aroma. Sweet and roasty flavor. Some licorice in the finish. Bitterness is minimal. Smooth body, creamy.
Buckeye Old Mammoth Stout;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Buckeye Brewing Company;I pronounce this a pretty good stout! Dense black and frothy head. Aromas of chocolate, dark fruit and roasted malt. The taste mirrors the nose. It is a meal unto itself!
Buckeye Old Mammoth Stout;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Buckeye Brewing Company;22oz bottle pours a watery, opaque black with some clumping beige head. Nose is chalky, dark chocolate. Flavor of chocolate, malts, bread, more chalk. Medium bodied, chalky finish. Very heavy carbonation detracts from the experience as well.
Buckeye Old Mammoth Stout;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Buckeye Brewing Company;pours black with a gigantic foamy tan head...excellent retention and lacing. aroma has some powdery cocoa, a wheaty, malty aroma like the aroma during sparging...faint hint of dark fruit...subtle milky sourness (the guy who rated this before me was spot on). flavor has coffee, dark fruit, and cocoa...roasty in the end. mouthfeel is super creamy and thick yet lively with a nice dry roasty finish...very nice beer!
Buckeye Old Mammoth Stout;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Buckeye Brewing Company;22. Thanks, Mike! Pours jet black with a dense and rather fizzy burnt tan head. Not much lace. Big roasty dry nose, a little chalky and maybe a bit milk sour but not much. More on the dry english porter side of foreign stout and less on the hoppy side. Creamy medium body with soft carb. Roast, chalk, a bit of coffee, and some milky sourness on the mid palate. Mild chocolatey finish. Nice solid stout.
Buckeye Old Mammoth Stout;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Buckeye Brewing Company;22 oz. bottle from Root Cellar in Cincinnati. I brought it to the Big Black Beer Bash 2011. Pours a deep, dark brown color with minimal visible carbonation and a tiny tan head. Aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malts, some coffee, and earth- basic but really nice. Same goes for the flavor, featuring dark chocolate, roasted caramel malts, coffee, earth and some toast. Medium-bodied, with mild carbonation and a roasty mouthfeel. Nothing in particular stands out about this one, but thatâ€™s fine because itâ€™s just a well-done foreign stout.
Buckeye Old Mammoth Stout;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Buckeye Brewing Company;Poured into a pint glass. 3.0 A: Black color. First pour was about 8-9 fingers of frothy head. This took forever to fill my glass up. Retention was reasonably good, but not any lacing. 4.0 S: Smells like thereâ€™s a lot of sourish lactose in here. Soft roastiness with even softer chocolate and molasses. Simple, but nice. 3.5 T: Again, seems like some lactose in here. Second strongest flavors are semi-sweet chocolate, roasted barley, and a touch of molasses. Relatively simple again, but not as nice as in the nose. 2.5 M: Lighter medium body. Way, way, way too much carbonation, but this doesnâ€™t surprise based on the pour. Itâ€™s BMC level carbonation and frankly distracted from my overall enjoyment of the beer. Too carbonated to be smooth. 3.0 D: Not a great beer, but not a bad one either...if the carbonation was fixed. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 06-26-2010 01:53:03
Buckeye Old Mammoth Stout;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Buckeye Brewing Company;My Bottom Line: Roasted coffee beans and dark chocolate seem to be drowning in a picklish flavor which must be the result of a slowly developing infection. Further Personal Perceptions: -A creamy veil of foam tops the brownish black. -Expansive carbonation might also be a result of this rising infection. -The body was strangely thin. -This is the first time I get a bad Buckeye bottle. Their beers are so wonderful that this experience wonâ€™t stop me from getting more of their brews, if I can get some, that is... Bottle.
John Harvard's Cambridge Whiskey Barrel Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;Sample at Extreme beer fest. 2002 version. Great nose, whiskey/coffee/prune/raisin. Clean black color, no light gets through. Bitter flavors, Same as nose. Thicker body, Oilt mouthfeel, Bitter roasted finish. This one lived up to the hype, a great brew.
John Harvard's Cambridge Whiskey Barrel Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;1/5/05. Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, shared with TAR and cb on The Deluxe Tour 1/5/05. Deep brown in color with a silky appearance as it pours from the bottle. Definitely not black as it pours, but when it sits in the glass itâ€™s an opaque and oily black-brown with red glazes. Deep, dark golden brown head, almost crimson along the edges. Decent sized head with thin outline and solid, shimmering beady lacing-- a bit blotchy but sometimes cascading down the sides of the glass in a nice, slow crawl. Aroma has a deep and complex woody character and subtle, lovely dark maltiness that I really love, along with a touch of soy sauce that I really donâ€™t and a faint trace of sweet smoke. Flavor has big chocolate malt and dry roast, shades of vanilla bean with very little sweetness. Continues with excellent woody character and a surprisingly delicate (?!) whiskey undertone. Mostly the wood of whiskey barrel, not so much the forceful alcohol. Touches of dark mushroom, earthy black truffle, dark chocolate. Haunting oyster sauce traces in the aroma. A very delicious whiskey barrel stout, and an exceptionally rare treat from my generous friends. Thanks Emily and Jeff!
John Harvard's Cambridge Whiskey Barrel Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;The beer as it emerges from the bottle a Jet Black color, the head is planetary in size, semi-creamy in texture, the color a toothsome light chocolate color as it evanesces the lace forms a satiny skirt to hide the glasses charms. â€œAh That Smellâ€, vanilla, sweet hints of bourbon, roasted grains, malt, molasses, a real compendium of the best â€œSmellsâ€ in â€œBeerdomâ€. Start is ambrosial, thick malt with the top chocolate fudge rich and thick, finish has a moderate acidity, and the hops are dynamic but pleasant, very dry and bittersweet aftertaste that lingers on the tongue. Nice belly warming sensation and a quite quaffable stout.
John Harvard's Cambridge Whiskey Barrel Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;Thick edging of deep tan foam crowned the dark confection of slight bourbon goodness. I thought the hard liquor flavor was perfectly balanced with the malts. Not a palate-encasing, throat-drowning, explosion however. Noticed some caramel toasted almost to the burning point, along with some prune. Extremely smooth texture.
John Harvard's Cambridge Whiskey Barrel Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;Dark plum with chestnut highlights. Creamy, mocha hued, tiny-bubbled foam. Luxurious aroma of fudge, cocoa, plum, black currant, dark rum, coconut, and butter. Rich caramel and lightly woody undertones. It's also estery and whiskey cask-ish, which collaborate to lend a vinous effect. Whiskey notes are subdued, thankfully, and enable its imperial stout components to shine. Velvety texture. Firm and toffeeish palate. Huge milk chocolate flavors followed by clean, minty alcohol and a late acidic burst. Whiskey notes remain in the background, but are clearly present. Touches of fruitcake and licorice, here and there. Finishes intensely fudge-like, with a coarse note of charcoal and afterthoughts whiskey casks, honeyed chocolate, and silky cappuccino. With a fuller body and aroma, this would precisely be what I seek in the style. Many thanks, Mitt!
John Harvard's Cambridge Whiskey Barrel Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;Chez Mittenstein - June 2003: Dark and slick in appearance with no carbonation. Smells burnt and sweet. Slow start to the taste which blossoms into a bitter whisky flavor. REALLY really nice. Get some if you can.
John Harvard's Cambridge Whiskey Barrel Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;Wow, what a perfect mixed. Most barrel aged beers have too much of the barrel flavor and not enough of the beer flavor, not this one. This one is dark brown almost black with a moderate head for an Imperial stout. Thin bodied for an Imperial. Flavor is excellent. Vanilla, whiskey, coffee, burnt flavors they are all there, none so heavey as to edge out the others. This is what wood aging is all about and others should strive for. Finish is somewhat sweet, but delicous. Great Beer, Thanks go out to Mittenstein.
John Harvard's Cambridge Whiskey Barrel Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;This is some black liquid.Fizzy,head suprisingly leaves ring,and lace.My goodness,such a inticing aroma. Whiskey,vanilla,chocolate,wood,toffee,bread. Mouthfeel is so soft,creamy(as a oatmeal stout),and silky. Unbelievably,clean malt flavors,with roast,vanilla,and cookie/bread.The wood and whiskey were noticable before finish but this is masterfully balanced.Finish has some more vanilla,roast,and just slightly,noticable hop.Lingering coffee bean and whiskey.This could not be any better. It is just so clean,balanced and tasty itâ€™s hard to call others favorites.Iâ€™m blown away! On the other hand,I will never see this again. Many thanks MItt.
John Harvard's Cambridge Whiskey Barrel Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;Strong notes of bourbon in the nose. Had a sizeable head on it. Flavor? Imagine some high-quality coffee, and then imagine pouring in a healthy dollop of (good) bourbon. It does complement the rest of the beer extremely well, setting off the sweeter chocolate and faint fruit flavors. Overall, a very good beer.
John Harvard's Cambridge Whiskey Barrel Imperial Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;Imperial Stout Blind Tasting (11-16-02): Visual: Small head. Aroma: nice bourbon, good dark malts. Flavor: more bourbon but not overpowering. The nicely balanced use of the bourbon creates perceived flavors of vanilla that blends nicely with the fruitiness and chocolate. Oh yeah.
Santorini;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;August Schell Brewing Company;On tap at Santorini in Eden Prairie. Pours dark amber/brown small head in plastic cup, classy. Not really any aroma hint of hops. Taste is bleak not much there really had to swish this around for any flavor, slight caramel and hops. Really a poor beer would get anything over this, although it might not be bad for getting drunk and hitting on suburban cougars.
Santorini;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;August Schell Brewing Company;On tap at Santorini Taverna and Grill in Eden Prairie. Dark copper in color. not much aroma. Lightly hopped with some malt. Odd taste that I could not quite put my finger on. Nothing special here.
Santorini;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;August Schell Brewing Company;Hopeful that this specially produced amber ale was a secret waiting to be discovered. Wrong. Over carbonation gives a feeling of champaign while the taste is off, either a weird barley or bad yeast. Wasnâ€™t going to enter it in here but saw an entry already exists. Not recommended.
Santorini;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;August Schell Brewing Company;Mildly surprised this beer had not been rated before. Santorini is contract brewed by Schell and, according to the bartender, has been in existence the entire 7+ years that the Minneapolis Greek restaurant from which it derives its name has been in business. The bartender felt that it tastes more like a Red Ale than an Amber, and although its reddish brown hue certainly is more characteristic of a Red, taste-wise I''m not sure I agree. Has a hint of hop bitterness with a pretty good dose of malt. There''s a little something off in the after-taste..perhaps yeast? Anyway, after giving it a try, I stuck with Redhook ESB the rest of the evening.

Big House Kolsch;Albany, New York, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;Big House Brewing;a very light kolsch, I believe this is a seasonal, somewhat plain, but not bad on a hot summer day.
Clay Pipe Pursuit of Happiness;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;01-Jan-14 (12-oz bottle: Obtained in trade with slob, thanks Bert!) Well, my last bottle of Pursuit of Happiness from this now-defunct brewery. The beer pours a hazy, dark-amber body with half an inch of off-white head that recedes to a ring. The nose is very malty like a Winter Warmer should be, with this one offering lots of caramel, toffee, dried fruit, and earth. On the palate, again, the malts are caramely, medium-sweet, and earthy, with toffee, decaying wood, some milk chocolate, dried apricot, and candied orange. Itâ€™s medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and very smooth and easy to drink. Overall, this has been a great beer over the years, and even at several years of age, itâ€™s still a great beer. Itâ€™s the kind of Winter Warmer I like most: no spices, no adjuncts, just straight up malty and delicious.
Clay Pipe Pursuit of Happiness;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;lots of barley but nothing too crazy, strong and smooth, goes down well, crystal malt, yum
Clay Pipe Pursuit of Happiness;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Bottle, 2004, shared by ryan. Pours with little to no head, rusty light brown. Light citrus, spice, and raisins in the aroma. Bready, and a little cakey. Slight sweetness and some cinnamon. Lighter to medium body. Not bad.
Clay Pipe Pursuit of Happiness;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Bottle, 2004, shared by ryan. Pours clear tawny with a small, fizzy beige head, short retention with light lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (bread, caramel, toasted), average hops (floral, grassy), and average esters (apple/pear) with notes of wood, alcohol, dates, and honey. Flavor is heavy malt (cookie, caramel, toasted), average hops (floral, grassy, citrus), and average esters (apple/pear) with notes of wood, alcohol, dates, and honey. Full body, medium warmth and carbonation, low creaminess with a dry finish.
Clay Pipe Pursuit of Happiness;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;2004 bottle courtesy of ryan, thank you sir!

Clay Pipe Pursuit of Happiness;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours an orange golden body with a white head and light lacing. Sweet with caramel and citrus malt tones. A bit sweet and light honey and citrus, candied sweetness and a light warming. A bit dull with a toasted malt undertone. Alright.
Clay Pipe Pursuit of Happiness;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Wow. What a magnificent change from the norm of winter warmers! Pours a hazy particulate suspended burnt amber with fading khaki head. This one forgoes the nutmeg and spices in favor of a honey and citrus hop. Huge underlying caramel backbone lends excellent support. This is superbly well complemented, the hops and the malt, but not blended. Each side shines through. And the alcohol is hidden very well. Nice job guys. Iâ€™ll definitely pick this up next year!
Clay Pipe Pursuit of Happiness;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;bottle, pours light amber with a strong sweet hop nose. Super sweet bread, like sticky buns and light bitterness in the finish
Clay Pipe Pursuit of Happiness;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;"Location: 12 oz bottle from Wine and Beer Westpark, 12/12/09 Aroma: The nose is rather hoppy and fruit, with some orange, apricot, and grapefruit along with toffee and caramel Appearance: Pours a somewhat clear copper-amber color with a thin white head that leaves a good amount of lace Flavor: Maltier then the nose, sweet citrus and malts dominate up-front, bitter backing leading to a good balance Palate: This beer is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, a nice, somewhat sticky mouthfeel, and a long finish Overall Impression: I live in MD, this beer is from MD, and I bought this one in VA? Well, sometimes it just works out that way. Iâ€™m pretty sure this isnâ€™t my first time drinking this one, but I didnâ€™t remember it well enough to know for sure. Smells almost like a nice IPA, doesnâ€™t really seem to have the spice components common in your usual winter warmer brew, but still a nice aroma. Taste is more balance, but still very nice. I canâ€™t say for sure how I would classify this, not really totally a winter warmer or an IPA, but somewhere in between, guess that is how it ended up in the ambiguous: ""American Strong Ale."" Also, Iâ€™m surprised to learn this one is over 8%, as it doesnâ€™t feel that way at all."
Clay Pipe Pursuit of Happiness;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Lightly hoppy nose with a bit of spice and malt. Amber color with white head. Like a mildy hopped up amber with a touch of spice. The hops carry all the way through lingering at the end with an earthy/fruity finish. A decent winter warmer, Iâ€™d have another.
Clay Pipe Backfin Pale Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Light pale ale. Golden pour. Floral hops in the nose. Taste is grass and resin. Rated 8/17/04
Clay Pipe Backfin Pale Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Pale amber color with a fizzy white head. Light citrus and pine notes with some sweet malts. Some light citrus hops and malts in the flavor. Nothing really stands out, or makes this one stand out from the pack. Itâ€™s not bad but not something Iâ€™d search out again.
Clay Pipe Backfin Pale Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Pours a nice amber color with a thin head. Aroma is malt a little hops. Flavor is sweet caramel, a little hops bitterness. Passable session beer. Not great not terrible.
Clay Pipe Backfin Pale Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Serving: 12 oz. bottle. Appearance: Deep orange color with a large, frothy, off-white head. Good head retention and spotty lacing. Aroma: Citrus and spice on the hops side, a bit of caramel and bread from the malt. Flavor: Decent bready maltiness with a solid citrus and floral hop backbone. A decent spicy finish. Palate: Medium carbonation with a medium-light mouthfeel and a medium, spicy finish. Overall: Not a bad APA. It went well with the blue crabs I was eating. Take it or leave it.
Clay Pipe Backfin Pale Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Bottle, World Market, Charlottesville. Dead lead amber/brown with half inch of off-white head. Tangy aroma, some sourness, light caramel. Flavor is light citrus and nuts. OK, but nothing new here.
Clay Pipe Backfin Pale Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Pours a slightly hazy orange caramel with a small white head. Aroma of tangy citrus, hops and caramel. Taste of tangy citrus, bread dough and hops...it is what it is...
Clay Pipe Backfin Pale Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Nice pale ale that has lots of caramel to it. Easily as much malt character in this one as the hops, and it really tastes more like a hoppy brown than a pale. Very nice though, pleasantly surprised.
Clay Pipe Backfin Pale Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Draft at BWI. Pours a dark amber with an off white head. Faint caramel and fruity ester aroma. Light bodied, approaching medium with a British mouthfeel. Malty flavor of caramel, toffee, maple, and nuts countered by a moderate, but balancing spicy bitterness. Very simple and balanced, and much better than the rating reflects. This is an enjoyable pale ale, but is really more in the British vein.
Clay Pipe Backfin Pale Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Bottle from a small but respects me shop in Baldwin,MD. Crystal clear reddish amber under a thin khaki head. Aroma of toasted malt and mild caramel. Flavor reminds me of a cross between an English Pale and a domestic Amber with a slightly metalic aftertaste. Strong malt profile but could use a healthier dose of hops. Short and dry finish. Not a bad beer but far from special.
Clay Pipe Backfin Pale Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Clay Pipe Brewing Company;Very nice amber pour. Sweet, grassy aroma with noticeable yeast. Pretty sweet and hoppy for a pale ale, with a touch of caramel and yeasty astringency. I wouldnâ€™t mind washing down a crabcake with one of these.
Watch City Clocktoberfest;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Watch City Brewing Co.;A nice orange amber ale with a thin lacing off white head. A nice perfumey malt with light cinnamon, very pleasant. In mouth, a nice vienna with caramel malt, butterscotch, a bit short overall. On tap at brewpub, Oct. 12 2008.
Watch City Clocktoberfest;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Watch City Brewing Co.;OK oktoberfest. Fairly one-dimensional flavor, lightly sweet with a dry, lightly bitter hop finish.
Watch City Clocktoberfest;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Watch City Brewing Co.;Draught pint at the brewpub, 12/18/2005. Pours a lightly chill-hazed amber-auburn with some deep beige tones and a small beige head, moderate to low retention and spotty lacing. Aroma of honey, maple, light vanillin and a touch of earthy, lightly toasted grains. Flavor begins with light fruitiness (peaches, nectarines, tangerines) and touches on a sweeter note, with vanilla and light maple syrup-like notes. Toasted grains add a deep earthy feel to it and overall the breadiness usually present in the style is quite underdone here. Light, flowery, leafy hops bitterness and flavor, no alcohol apparency. Texture is rather loose, though the body is at least not thin. Carbonation is low, but lightly engaging at times.
Watch City Clocktoberfest;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Watch City Brewing Co.;Pours a medium amber, with a small head that leaves just a touch of lacing. Aroma is slightly bready, but mainly dominated with caramel and toffee, with a hint of hops. Flavor is caramel, toffee, some breadiness, and finishes with a small whiff of hops. Medium in body, quite nice.
Watch City Clocktoberfest;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Watch City Brewing Co.;"Looks pretty much like a typical deep reddish amber brew. Not impressively malty either. Again, as seems the trend with many American brewers these days, they tend to junk up everything with TOO much hops. Dude, let the malts have a little more say in the matter! Fairly sweet and ""flowery"" finish. Overall though, this was one of the nicest brewpubs I have visited recently in the area, and I will definately go back!"
Morenita Especial Del Sur;Chile;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);Sweeter, milder and altogether less interesting than the original recipe. Better than most beers in Chile, still that''s hardly saying anything positive.

Mild, sweet flavour of honey, faint wheat malt and herbal hops in a dry finish. Light body with a thin, watery texture and soft carbonation. Inoffensive and boring, almost a Blonde Ale.

But again same story. Thin ring literally disappears in seconds and leaves nothing behind! Even worse that the Island Red (if thatâ€™s possible!). Not good and i dread whatâ€™s coming. Smell: Ok, not bad. Some grass (and wheat maybe?) with a mild bitterness and some grain. I think iâ€™m being generous on this score only because i expected worse and was surprised. Taste: Very hard to grasp on the flavors. A bit of sweetness and an aftertaste of honey but not much else. At least there are no off flavors but not terribly interesting. Again, i feel iâ€™m being to kind on this score but it exceeds my expectations (which were by this point pretty low). Reviewed on: 08-27-2009

Church End Pews Porter;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Porter;Church End Brewery;Cask from Gatehouse Tavern, Coventry. Near black, with lots of streaky coffee coloured lacing. Aroma was subdued and primarily milky coffee. Maybe this was a bad pint, because I didnâ€™t get the expected range of porter flavours, just cheap chocolate. Lingering bitter finish, but not altogether pleasant.

Hirter Biobier;Micheldorf, Austria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brauerei Hirt;getrunken ANfang 2018 Dieses Biobier gibt es schon lÃ¤nger und die Tatsache, dass das Etikett auf Deutsch, Italienisch und Slowenisch erinnert an eine Zeit, in der es noch kein Bio-Bier in Italien und Slowenien gab. Dieses Bier, hat offenbar durch seinen Geschmack Ã¼berzeugt und nicht nur deshalb, dass es Bio ist. Es ist unglaublich sÃ¼ffig und lÃ¤sst sich wunderbar trinken.

Elevator Belgian Nit Wit;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Elevator Brewing Company;7/20/2007: Elevator Belgian Wit is a cloudy, pale yellow color with a foamy white head. Wheat, light citrus and some spice are in the aroma. The flavor is a bit sour and grassy with some lemon citrus. There is a mild amount of alcohol that seems to sneak into the flavor as well. This is not a typcial Witbier and definitely was not as expected. It was more like a poor attempt at a Farmhouse Ale or something. It was a bit disappointing to say the least... Draught at Luckyâ€™s in Athens, Ohio during the Ohio Brew Week 2007. Rating #9 for this beer...
Elevator Belgian Nit Wit;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Elevator Brewing Company;Mid-hazed pale golden with a white halo when served. Clove, florals and... mystery spices in the aroma add allure and intrigue. Thin-bodied with a wheat base flavor smothered by flowers and spice. Interesting, yet seemingly incorrect. On draught at Elevator Brewing Co., Columbus, OH 43215
Elevator Belgian Nit Wit;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Elevator Brewing Company;Nose of yeast & spice, pears & bananas and oddly enough - pickles. The brew is cloudy golden honey. The quick white frothy head leaves no lace. Well balanced, heavy acidity, with a very briney metallic finish that all but ruins the flavor. The light body is dry and soft. Canâ€™t help but wonder if there was something wrong mechanically with the tap system on this one. Thanks to Jana for the sample.
Elevator Belgian Nit Wit;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Elevator Brewing Company;Hazy pale yellow color. Some citrus aroma, but could just be the lemon slice. Mild citrus and wheat flavor. Not much in the way of spice flavoring. Still, drinkable and thirst quenching.

Elevator Belgian Nit Wit;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Elevator Brewing Company;"Rerate 5/2/12: Sampled this beer under the updated name ""Nit Wit"" and had a better experience. Same color, but with more of a traditional body and spice and citrus flavor one would associate with a Wit. Still pretty average. 6/29/06: This is the June selection in Elevatorâ€™s ""MBA"" program. This is the first seasonal from the Elevator that has been poorly done. It is also the first time I have had the equivalent of a ""drain pour"" at a brewpub, being unable to come close to finishing it. Served with a slice of orange. The beer is cloudy yellow/gold with a thin white head that diminishes quickly. Slick lacing. Aroma of light spices and citrus. Light-bodied and crisp with a zesty spice and citrus flavor for a split second, then an immediate blast of soap and moldy yeast flavor that is wince-inducing. Moreover, this unpleasant flavor seems to coat the tongue and stay there. The finish is no better, as any of the good flavors are overpowered by the lingering moldy wet dish rag flavor. Maybe an off batch but I will be scared to ever try this again."
Elevator Belgian Nit Wit;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Elevator Brewing Company;From notes: Pale and carbonated. Small sweetness combined with coriander. Floral. Pretty good for a wit.

CB Kilden LettÃ¸l;Bergen, Norway;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;A yellow beer with a white head. The aroma is boring with primary notes of straw - I find it somewhat artificial. The flavor contains notes of straw as well as light notes of corn, leading to a dry end. A real light beer.

Left Hand Warrior IPA;Longmont, Colorado, United States;IPA;Left Hand Brewing Company;This is more like a hoppy APA versus an IPA. Fresh hopped though, which gives it a smoother mouthfeel, plus the fact that it just isn't that malty. Well balanced, but worth nowhere near the full price tag on this. Even at half off on clearance felt like was slightly pricey. I like Left Hand, but going to stick with their standard beers bottled in 6-packs from now on. Bottle is slightly old so that could have lowered the rating somewhat.
Left Hand Warrior IPA;Longmont, Colorado, United States;IPA;Left Hand Brewing Company;Draft at Bru Craft. Mostly clear deep gold with a thick off-white head. Bit of an odd bird. Grassy. Watery. Lagery clean finish. Rain-soaked grass clippings. Cracker malts. Hints of peach, pine, clove, and clementine. Different from the standard wet hop IPAs.
Left Hand Warrior IPA;Longmont, Colorado, United States;IPA;Left Hand Brewing Company;22floz bottle BBD 01.21.2017 (paid $4 because itâ€™s a little old). Consumed 04.03.2017. A copper colored IPA with a large head that falls to create a plateau. Orange zest and lavender combine to create a soap-like aroma. Body is full, and leathery taste has a harsh bitterness. Brewed to be drunk fresh, so it could be marginally better. I prefer a greater hop to malt balance, this beer lacked malt character.
Left Hand Warrior IPA;Longmont, Colorado, United States;IPA;Left Hand Brewing Company;Pours a dark golden with an ample eggshell colored head. Grassy and very spicy nose. Spicy, rye, cinnamon, clove, grass, and berry(?) flavors. Weird IPA. Not in a good way. I was waiting for a while on trying this one and Iâ€™m disappointed.

Left Hand Warrior IPA;Longmont, Colorado, United States;IPA;Left Hand Brewing Company;BBD 1/13/16. Clear amber pour with a dark ruby cast. Outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention. Outstanding nose of orange and light pine over biscuit coupled with a bit of earthy spice. Light body with a texture similar to that of water but coupled with an outstanding oily slickness. Superb carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish. The flavor profile is very good. This is a hop flavor focused beer with moderate bitterness that is balanced with toasty biscuit and caramel. Like the nose, orange dominates with pine and spicy elements in the background. Along with moderate bitterness in the middle, caramel makes a strong appearance. The finish is semi-dry and a hint of alcohol astringency arrives over a lingering slightly sweet rind/pine bitterness.
Left Hand Warrior IPA;Longmont, Colorado, United States;IPA;Left Hand Brewing Company;Bomber. Pours copper with a big fluffy off-white head that has good retention. Aroma of wet pine needles and a trace of fresh grapefruit. The taste, likewise, is more piney that citrusy and set in a light caramel malt base that is slightly sweet. The palate is medium, finishes sweet. Overall: Very easy drinking IPA, good stuff.
Left Hand Warrior IPA;Longmont, Colorado, United States;IPA;Left Hand Brewing Company;22oz bottle pour from home with a best by date of 1/13/16 (one week from review). Pours a light reddish color with nice fluffy head. A solid beer...not bad...but not mind blowing either.

Graf Dracula;Ungheni, MureÅŸ, Romania;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bere Mures (Heineken Romania);Little plastic bottle. Amber-brown color. Malty aroma. Full taste of caramel malts. Little bit strong for hot summer.
Graf Dracula;Ungheni, MureÅŸ, Romania;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bere Mures (Heineken Romania);2l-PET bottle. Clear brown colour with an amber glow and a fluffy off-white head. Lovely aroma of chocolate and dark malts. Full-bodied, hopy, with a dry mouthfeel and pleasant flavours of liquorice, chocolate, caramel and roasetd malts. Slightly hoppy. Despite its high ABV the alcohol appears only in a warming shadow. Quite nice!

Dark ruby red color, good creamy beige head, lace. Light papery aroma. Some caramel, light licorice, strong metallic flavor. Aftertaste is a bit sweet. Not too bad for being PET-bottled Romanian.

Aroma is bready malts, caramel and some mild hops. Flavour is caramel, hops, dry wood and some mild licorice in the finish. Rather pleasant!
Graf Dracula;Ungheni, MureÅŸ, Romania;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bere Mures (Heineken Romania);"Bottle. 50cl PET, shared by larsga. It pours a blood-reddish black body, or maybe itâ€™s just copper ;-), anyway, itâ€™s topped by a small, beige head. The aroma has toffee, some grains and alcohol. Thereâ€™s toffee in the flavor too, some roasted malt, as well as a touch of fruits and alcohol. Medium boudy. Wee touch of alcohol in the finish as well as an even weaker burnt note, and toffee. Drinkable, but far from a great brew. (080216)"

Graf Dracula;Ungheni, MureÅŸ, Romania;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bere Mures (Heineken Romania);500 ml plastic bottle provided and shared by larsga, thanks. A thin greyish head over a reddish amber body. Sweet malts and toffe dominates the aroma. Scents of roast. Strong and sweet caramellish malt taste. Burnt sugar and roast underneath. Healthy body. Light sticky texture. Mild bitterness towards the finish. Unusual, but goes well down.

Dryish-sweetish roasty caramelly grainy taste with papery rubbery notes. Decent, but not really good. (0.5l PET bottle bought outside Bran castle, Romania.)

Pumpkin and nutmeg call out to you as you lift the glass. Bringing it to your lips the pumpkin is oh so understated with distinctively nutmeg overtones. Overall, drinks like a good lager--with pumpkin mixed in. One of the better pumpkin brews Iâ€™ve had, this time on tap at Cool Beans.

Jacks IPA;Fremont, California, United States;IPA;Jacks Brewing Company;Shaker pint draft at Jacks Brewing Company in Fremont, California. The pour is a hazed orange golden with a small white head.

Jacks IPA;Fremont, California, United States;IPA;Jacks Brewing Company;Thanks to bu11zeye for sharing this growler. Golden-orange pour with a white head. The aroma is full of resin and pine notes, very similar to what I got in the Jacks Double IPA. The flavor is more like the aroma where I get some pine and orange character, as well as enough biscuit malt to keep the bitterness low. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.
Jacks IPA;Fremont, California, United States;IPA;Jacks Brewing Company;Poured golden amber, complex hop flavors(citrus, earthy, piney), caramel malts.
Jacks IPA;Fremont, California, United States;IPA;Jacks Brewing Company;Pours a nice clear copper with a thin cream colored head. Citrus and pine hop nose. The flavor in the front has a strange lemon citrus to it, the subsides to allow more traditional hop bitterness and dryness in the mid to finish, which are both very solid. Not crazy about that front, but beside that this is a nice IPA.
Jacks IPA;Fremont, California, United States;IPA;Jacks Brewing Company;Draft from a sampler at the San Ramon brewpub. Deep orange in color, a bit hazy. Some orange and floral hops in the nose. Flavor of grapefruit, orange, perfume, and floral hops. Balanced bitterness that softly dissipates. Crisp and pleasant. Jackâ€™s pale ales stand head and shoulders above their others.

Neumarkt Premium;Ungheni, MureÅŸ, Romania;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Bere Mures (Heineken Romania);Dieses Bier wurde mir schon von meinen rumÃ¤nischen Freunden aus TÃ¢rgu MureÈ™ (auf deutsch: Neumarkt am Mieresch) als nicht besonders beschrieben, was aber meine Neugier noch weiter bestÃ¤rkte. Also kaufte ich mir die bauchige 1l-Plastikflache mit dem peinlich kitschigen Aufdruck der Altstadt von Neumarkt und einem deutsch-rumÃ¤nischen Beschriftungsmix. In RumÃ¤nien gibt man Bieren gerne deutsche Namen, offenbar um ein bisschen von dem guten Ruf der deutschen Brauereien zu profitieren. Gut -als Mitbringsel fÃ¼r einen Bahnhofspenner mag dieses Bier mÃ¶glicherweise ganz gut passen, fÃ¼r alles andere ist es nicht zu empfehlen.
Neumarkt Premium;Ungheni, MureÅŸ, Romania;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Bere Mures (Heineken Romania);Bottle in Cluj Napoca, Romania. Golden color, white head. Pretty common beer, refreshing but not special
Neumarkt Premium;Ungheni, MureÅŸ, Romania;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Bere Mures (Heineken Romania);Plastic bottle 50 cl. Pours an odd orangey golden with a tiny, white head. Odd cardboardish aroma. Medium body, strangely unclean with no real malt feel - just this cardboard note. Roughish bitterness. One of the poorest Pale Lagers I've had for a while. 170818

Vestfyen Nat Expressen;Assens, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;Foam is very nice and have a good aroma of hops and caramel. Most of caramel taste, but also it has a little off-flavors of the alcohol and a relatively gentle and continuous hop bitterness. It is easy to drink and good, but lacking in my opinion both richness and depth.
Vestfyen Nat Expressen;Assens, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;Bottle. Amber, small beige head. Aroma is malty and grainy notes. Flavour is caramel malty, slightly nutty, with a metallic, rather harsh finish. not exactly sophisticated, but what to exoect from a beer with three E-aditives?
Vestfyen Nat Expressen;Assens, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;50cl Brown bottle, best before 27th Nov 2008, drank 17th Feb 2009, almost three months overdue. Nice front label, a Golden Steam Train on a black background with golden stars or snow flakes above. I poured the beer into a Hoegaarden Grand Cru tulip glass (twice). A Pale Euro lager it is not. This is a deep, dark amber coloured lager, with a real red tint to it. The white head consisting of fairly large bubbles soon fell away to a collar and wisp covering. Initial aroma of yeast before the pour, but once out of the bottle there was very little to test my senses on the smell front. gets my normal lager odourless score of 3. Dry, with some malty/molasses sweetness trying to even the dryness up, but failing to do so. The body is typical cheap lager, meaning thin and watery with no force of character or personality. The 6% alcohol does come through, but I think a headache would follow if anyone had more than two of these.
Vestfyen Nat Expressen;Assens, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;50 cl bottle at home. ABV is 6%. Clear chestnut body with a tan colored foamy head thick as my little finger. The head recedes and leaves excellent lacing. Toasted caramel notes in the aroma and som faint hints of dried fruits. Medium body. Quite bitter from beginning to end and caramel sweetness on top. A little too carbonated, yet also smooth. A little papery and metallic.OK, but I probably wonâ€™t buy it again.

Deja un regusto metÃ¡lico.

Bittings Garden State IPA;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;IPA;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;pint on tap, pours a medium golden copper small head and not so much for lacing.. aroma of herbal pine, grapefruit citrus not to strong..taste was nice, not an overwhelming hop kick up front but a good balance for a pub ipa.. overall itâ€™s very drinkable and a nice ipa, but it doesnâ€™t match up to my favs like hopdevil or stone, just not hoppy enough although it was sure nice to have an ipa on tap in a local place which you just donâ€™t get in to many places..
Bittings Garden State IPA;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;IPA;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;A great IPA. Really canâ€™t go wrong here. I wouldnâ€™t put it into the â€™amazingâ€™ category, but itâ€™s everything you would want when you are looking for a solid IPA. Love JJâ€™s.
Bittings Garden State IPA;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;IPA;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;This is much like the Garden State IPA but it is aged in a cask. It is amber coloured with a off white large head. It is served about room temperature and light on the carbonation. The flavor is of hops and a little woodsy. Overall this is a good beer better then the normal GS IPA but still not as good as the Imperial. Earlier Rating: 5/27/2008 Total Score: 3.4 This isnâ€™t as good as the other IPA that JJâ€™s offers nor is it as good as the IPA on cask, but that being said this is a good beer. Tastes of hops and malt. Very small white head.
Bittings Garden State IPA;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;IPA;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;sampled and had a pint at the brewery. This was the best of the lot during my visit. Almost clear light amber/orange in color. Aroma was on the weak side for an IPA- some subtle citrus and floral but not a good start. The taste was better however, with some leafy citrus and a moderate warrior hop bitterness. pretty clean...I like more assertive IPAâ€™s, but this one was enjoyable enough.
Bittings Garden State IPA;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;IPA;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Clear orange beer whose large off-white foam is fed by a healthy carbonation. Leafy and floral cascades show rather subtly in the nose, so do the caramel malts. Initially rather sweet, fruity and gently citrusy, but it grows a firm bitterness after a few sips. The whole thing bathes in a partly sloppy and earthy maltiness that could use an extra bit of freshness though. It does not come across as a very bright IPA, but I must still declare it one of my favourite tries at J.J. Bitting.
Bittings Garden State IPA;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;IPA;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;On tap at the pub, it was served with a nice head and kept good lacing as it went down in my glass. Nice dark copper coloring and citrus-like aroma. More malty than bitter, this was enjoyable enough to order a second pint. Well made and drinkable, this is middle of the road IPA that is obviously geared towards a wide variety of patrons, not just hopheads.
Bittings Garden State IPA;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;IPA;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Tap. This is a pretty decent well made regular IPA. Deep copper pour with a nice tight sticky white head and good lace. Citrus hop aroma blended with a slight herbal and spiciness especially in the flavor and bitterness. Lightly malty all the way through which lets the hops come through. Easy drinking and refreshing IPA. Well made.
Bittings Garden State IPA;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;IPA;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Draft at brewpub. Pours amber with off-white head. Mild citrus hop aroma. Malt flavor of caramel with some toastiness. Finish has a clean fruity hop bitterness. No lingering bitterness or resiny texture. Just a clean easy to drink IPA that pairs well with food.
Bittings Garden State IPA;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;IPA;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;on tap-pours a creamy, retaining offwhite head that laces with copper color. Aroma is hops. Taste is crisp medium hops, balanced with secondary malt, then sweet and citrus. Middle of style & very well done.
Bittings Garden State IPA;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;IPA;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Crystal clear amber body with off-white head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma is medium sweet, herbal/grapefruit, caramel. Taste is medium sweet, caramel, herbal/grapefruit. Light-medium body with carbonation befitting a cask beer (though it was not a cask version). One of the mildest hop character for an IPA that I have ever had. That being said, it was ok in its own right.
Black Rock Amarillo Ale;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Rock Brewing Company;Nasty, horrible, very sour flavors, not good on the palate, very bitter but not in the good-bitter kinda way
Australian;India;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;International Breweries Pvt. Ltd.;Bottle (Old Notes)-Pours golden with a decent head. Aroma of corn, sweetness, hops, and malt. Taste of the same with a bit more hops. This light bodied brew was not bad.

Good lace and head retention. Aroma is malty,with noticeable hop balanced in. Smooth, creamy, mouthfeel.Great malty flavor and loads of hops. Spicy hops all over but malt lingers forever. A great pilsner!
Nodding Head California Common;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Nodding Head Brewery;sparkling and inviting, grapefruit and lychee aroma as well as a hint of baking soda. reasonably bitter with a hint of stewed apples, good stuff
Nodding Head California Common;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Nodding Head Brewery;This is a full amber with a head that sticks to the glass. At first, I thought there was something odd in the aroma. The longer I drank the beer the more I realized that it was just the American grapefruit hops this beer is laced with. Iâ€™m not used to that hop profile in a lager and often American hops clash with the lager flavors, but this worked. This is an interesting lager thatâ€™s hopped like an average APA.
Nodding Head California Common;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Nodding Head Brewery;Very excellent offering of the California common style beers, this definitely ranks right up there with some of the CA styles that Anchor brews

Mi fisrt Sri Lanka Beer!
Lion (India);Ghaziabad, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mohan Meakin Breweries;"Decent enough for a lager, but a little weak tasting. Not bad if you are eating overwhelmingly hot Indian food; itâ€™ll wash down curry like nobodyâ€™s business."
Lion (India);Ghaziabad, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mohan Meakin Breweries;Deep golden colour with fluffy white head. Aroma of hops and flowers. Clean slightly malty taste. Refreshing on a hot day. Smooth creamy palate, clean aftertaste. Good lager beer from India.
Bullfrog Czech Pilsener;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bullfrog Brewery;Too hoppy for my liking in the pilsener category, golden color, nice soft white lacy head, the hoppiness was way too over-powering
Paulaner Original MÃ¼nchner MÃ¤rzen;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);A liter at a time, every 30 minutes or so, gets you feeling good.

Paulaner Original MÃ¼nchner MÃ¤rzen;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Malty with a carmely flavor. There's a biscuity vibe as others have stated and maybe nutty. The mouth feel is thin, but truthfully I don't care because this pleasant to drink. When I think of Octoberfest, this is the beer I think they would be serving. One can just enjoy the atmosphere of the festival with your friends and family. The beer isn't spectacular as there's not a lot flavors going on, but it's really drinkable and on a hot day, I'd reach for this for sure. I think my dad would classify this a lawnmower beer and he'd be right. Definitely, I'd buy this again. If you want just an easy drinking beer, I think you may have found it.

Notes are caramel malt, dark fruit, pepper, grass, cracker, and nuts. Earthy and not overly sweet for the style but the body is a little light for the style. Still a decent Marzen
Scorpion Lager Beer;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Camerons Brewery (UK);8/5/2018. Keg at the Half Moon, Darlington. Pours fizzy pale gold with a lasting white head.

Scorpion Lager Beer;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Camerons Brewery (UK);Crisp and clean. Light malts with a watery mouthfeel. It is pale lager and it tastes like a pale lager. Better than the average affair in UK pubs. Very good in the summer and thirst quenching. I am not even sure it is available outside the north east of England and frankly my mates who still live there question if it is still made ( this was a memory review heh) .
Scorpion Lager Beer;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Camerons Brewery (UK);Canâ€™t believe I found this on here. Not going to be a very useful rating as I drank most of these warm or through a bottle-bong when i was 17. Canâ€™t remember it tasting of much but it was very cheap.
Scorpion Lager Beer;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Camerons Brewery (UK);past the best by date for sure, but still tasted ok, although slight hints of cardboard came through, but this was still refreshing. mild carbonation for a pale lager, but the bottle says premium later. not much going on though. easily forgettable probably deserving of its low ratings.
Scorpion Lager Beer;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Camerons Brewery (UK);Bottled. Hazy yellow colour, minor white bubbly head. Fruitish aroma with caramelly notes. A bit watery, but caramelly and malty flavour. Not that special.
Scorpion Lager Beer;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Camerons Brewery (UK);First time around the aftertaste isnâ€™t all that great. After youâ€™ve got past the first can though youâ€™ll be hooked.
Scorpion Lager Beer;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Camerons Brewery (UK);Soft carbonation in a golden, headless drink... a sweet grassy aroma... malty sweet taste... watery... hardwater finish... sucks. World Market, Orland Park, IL

Barley Creek Angler Black Lager;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Solid black lager. Pours cola black with a small white top.

Barley Creek Angler Black Lager;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Growler from BC $8 Wednesday! Barely translucent brown with nice tan head. Malt aroma. A bit malty sweet, roasty, some bitterness. Generally clean and although dryness lingers.
Barley Creek Angler Black Lager;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewery, 7/4/16. Dark brownish pour. Light, malty aroma and flavor. Feels a little thin, but okay overall. Not a terrible beer or anything, itâ€™s okay, but overall, this is a pretty forgettable example of the style.
Barley Creek Angler Black Lager;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;"Dark brown rimming beige head; little to no aroma; flava is roasty bready malty; feels light medium decent foamy fizz; finishes dry roasty"

Barley Creek Angler Black Lager;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;"Poured into a nonic at 50 degrees Full review at http://lownobudgetreviews.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/barley-creek-brewing-company-tannersville-pa-navigator-angler-and-antler/ (Ryanâ€™s Reviews) ANGLER is a great example of a lager that actually maintains some pretty deep and interestingly complex flavor profiles, even though it is a lagerâ€¦ and that impressed me immensely! ANGLER pours a deep near-black brown with a creamy light tan head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves nearly no lacing, but this is to be expected with a lager. The scent rising out of the nonic is all coffee and roasted malt, big smoky scents without smelling like a smoked beer, a lot more depth to it than I was anticipating from this lager. Taking that first taste, I think: this is a lager I could actuallyâ€¦ like. It has some of the flavors youâ€™d expect from what Iâ€™m smelling â€“ coffee, roasty, deep flavors akin somewhat with a stout â€“ yet it also has that dry crispness I expect from a lager, and a very mild hoppiness on the exit, just enough to remind you that there are some hops in the beer. The lagering process has made the flavor profile a lot more one-dimensional than it would be if it were an ale, which is not necessarily a bad thing; not everyone is into big flavors and not everyone will appreciate the complexities of a Russian Imperial Stout. ANGLER would be a great stepping-stone for someone working their way out of AAL and into better beers, darker beers. ANGLER looks thick, until you hold it up to the light and see how thin it really is. The beer is meager and zesty in its body; while from across the room it looks like a stout, drinking ANGLER makes its lager heritage extremely obvious. That lager body makes ANGLER a very easily drinkable beer."
Barley Creek Angler Black Lager;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Pours a burnt sienaish brown. Lovely malty sweetness on the nose. Nice smooth taste with just that hint of indeterminate sweetness. The finish is a bit bitter but not yet mouth-puckeringly so.
Barley Creek Angler Black Lager;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;From bottle. Roasty aroma to this with lots of chocolate malt, coffee, and roasted barley. Rich nose, very fragrant and pleasant. Dark brown-black clear with thin off-white head. Medium watery body with heavy carbonation. Starts sweet with roasted barley, chocolate and light coffee. Nutty and sweet with dry tangy finish and light chalky after. A little acidity from some over carbonation, but a nice schwarzbier.
Barley Creek Angler Black Lager;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Sampled on draught at the brewery in Tannersville. A normal shwarz with nothing too distinguishing other then a metallic nose that I didnâ€™t particularly enjoy. Dark black colour, thin beige head. Taste has some licorice, and spinach. Wierd.

Nodding Head Fat Boy Porter;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Nodding Head Brewery;Pretty dark, not as opaque as some. Light roasty coffee aroma, somewhat bland some stinky notes. Pruney, light creosote, mouthy a bit too sweet for the style and malty. Falls off towards a stout. Pistachio and clean finish. A little fuddled, but drinkable.

Bittings Rat Pack Pilsener;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;This is a re-rate. I had it on tap at Bitting. It pours a cloudy golden with some white head, and lacing. The aroma was some hops, bread, and grass. The taste is hoppier than I remember with light hints of citrus and grain. Itâ€™s pretty smooth with nice bitterness. This batch was much better than previous versions.

Bittings Rat Pack Pilsener;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewpub. Simplistic and bad. Golden body with a small white head. Aroma of sweet corn and vegetables, artificial sugar. Flavor is bland....grains and maybe corn. Weak.

Bittings Rat Pack Pilsener;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Good sized frothy bright white head of fine bubbles. Light carbonation. Light malts, lemon and some spicy hops in the aroma. Color is a very pale yellow with good clarity. Soft biscuity malts up front and then some spicy hops late swallow. Just a little though. Some lemon and cereal grains intertwined with the other flavors as well. Finishes a bit pasty with some spicy lemon. A pretty good pilsner.
Bittings Rat Pack Pilsener;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Yellowy color with low carbonation. Flavor was grassy, and it didnâ€™t have the aroma or crispness that I expect from the style. Didnâ€™t impress, sorry.
Bittings Rat Pack Pilsener;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Pretty solid, although I would probably go with another one of JJâ€™s offerings if I was in town. Unimaginative pils.
Deca Abdijbier BiÃ¨re dAbbaye Blonde;Woesten-Vleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Deca Services;Vintage bottle , best by 2004. Pours clear blonde, head fades in a second. big visual carbonation ( think of a lager ) Smell is apples, bit sour even, and some sweetness. Taste is sharp. A oxidized subtaste, over a sour, and I mean this in a very good way, apple-like maltyness. I expected a drainpour, but got what probably is the best aged blond beer to date ( accept sours of course ) ! I donâ€™t get why itâ€™s still so good, but the light oxidation, apple character-like sourness combo, really works. Even though this beer probably tasted way dofferent back in the day, itâ€™s nothing short of awesome today!
Deca Abdijbier BiÃ¨re dAbbaye Blonde;Woesten-Vleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Deca Services;Not much to say about this one. It was just simply boring. Must be why it was discontinued by Deca.
Deca Abdijbier BiÃ¨re dAbbaye Blonde;Woesten-Vleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Deca Services;Cloudy dark golden colour. Bready aroma. Flavour is also bready and seems a little oxidized.
Deca Abdijbier BiÃ¨re dAbbaye Blonde;Woesten-Vleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Deca Services;A hazy orange beer with a huge white head. The aroma has strong notes of citrus and dust, while the flavor is sweet with notes of yeast, spices, citrus, as well as some dust - which I believe is from the hops.
Deca Abdijbier BiÃ¨re dAbbaye Blonde;Woesten-Vleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Deca Services;Bottled: Golden coloured. Unclear. Dense beige head. Sweet, yeasty, fruity aroma with a dash of alcohol to spice up the nose. Flavour is spiced and has some fruity accents. Is quite thin and a bit over the top. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Quite nice.
Deca Abdijbier BiÃ¨re dAbbaye Blonde;Woesten-Vleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Deca Services;(Bottle 25 cl) Steen and I found this in a dusty box at the stockroom, when we visited Deca last July. (Deca is a bit of a peculiar mix between a microbrewery and liquorstore) This is quite a few years old and is no longer produced. However, itâ€™s quite lively in the glass, with a tall living head on top of an onrange-golden beer with sediments in the bottle. Smells a bit sour and unpleasant. The flavor however is primarily bitter on a quite light body. 250904
Deca Abdijbier BiÃ¨re dAbbaye Blonde;Woesten-Vleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Deca Services;"Caramel and vinous ""chardonnay"" aroma. and flavor. Sherry flavor coming up.

Phillips Coffee Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Phillips Brewing Co.;Not Phillipsâ€™ best offering - not even their best stout. Coffee, dark chocolates and malts are all present but this one doesnâ€™t stand out.
Phillips Coffee Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Phillips Brewing Co.;341mL bottle, pour a dark brown with a small beige head. Aroma of coffee, light roast, not much else. Flavour of very light roasted coffee, light roasted and some metallic notes. Very light-bodied and watery - maybe the most watered down stout Iâ€™ve ever head, if you can even call this a stout. Pretty piss poor.
Phillips Coffee Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Phillips Brewing Co.;Looks great, but looks can be deceiving. When you read the label, youâ€™re expecting something exceptional. Not quite. Coffee and chocolate is there, but if you really, really, really love stout, this one, unfortunately, is a little bit week
Phillips Coffee Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Phillips Brewing Co.;Lagerboys should like this thin, flavoured stout. Nice roasty coffee malt aroma and taste, some chocolate too. Nice and light, not overpowering. Good desert beer.
Phillips Coffee Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Phillips Brewing Co.;Pours black in the glass but when held up to the light is actually dark brown. Small head disappears before the first sip. Hint of hops in the aroma. Not getting a lot of roasted malt in the flavor, there is some coffee. Not bad but I like more robust stouts, this is very mild.
Phillips Coffee Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Phillips Brewing Co.;Bottle from trade. Pours a dark brown with a thin off white head. Aroma is weak coffee aroma with off almost sour notes. Flavour has a nice coffee malt with bitter chocolate, a bit thin. Okay.
Phillips Coffee Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Phillips Brewing Co.;Poured a with thick, creamy head. VERY dark appearance, almost couldnâ€™t see any light through the glass. Not much aroma at first, but after drinking half the glass, there was a hint of coffee. Tast was okay, with traces of chocolate.
Phillips Coffee Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Phillips Brewing Co.;Smells like industrial coffee grounds and freshly brewed coffee, and the taste is equally as Folgers. Balanced with a good bittersweet aftertaste of roasted malt and coffee. Suffers from some thinness in body, but itâ€™s pretty drinkable.
Phillips Coffee Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Phillips Brewing Co.;Bottle shared with HogTownHarry, blankboy & jerc - courtesy of blankboy. Dark brown with a huge mocha head. Aroma of stale malt with a faint hint of coffee. Thin body. Bland flavour of weak, sour, watery coffee. As the others have noted, we hope to try the more recent, supposedly better version sometime, but for now, itâ€™s a thumbs down from us.
Phillips Coffee Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Phillips Brewing Co.;Bottle (650ml) shared with HogTownHarry, GregClow & jerc -- my bottle courtesy of CapFlu. Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a large mostly-lasting foamy tan head. Decent lacing. Mediocre aroma of lightly roasted malt and not much else. Watery flavour of roasted malt and coffee. Light to medium bodied. Bland, watery and dull -- very disappointing. Iâ€™ve heard thereâ€™s a new, much better batch of this available, if thatâ€™s the case I will have to revisit and rerate it as I know Phillips is capable of much better then this.
Eschweger Jacobinus BierspezialitÃ¤t Classic;Eschwege, Hesse, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Eschweger Klosterbrauerei;Bottle. Gold with a white head that's soon a cm. Nice cracker and biscuit aroma matched with less convincing notes - some cardboard with the floral and spices. Lightish bodied and clean with crackery malt, the slightest touch of richness and firm, spicy bitterness. Finish makes up for the cheapish aroma. OK.

Eschweger Jacobinus BierspezialitÃ¤t Classic;Eschwege, Hesse, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Eschweger Klosterbrauerei;Hoje dia de fugir um pouco das cervejas com um tanto de firula e voltar para algo mais tradicional, refrescante e saboroso, uma cerveja alemÃ£ de cara, forma e gosto. A apresentaÃ§Ã£o da cerveja Ã© bem bonita, com um tom um tanto medieval e coloraÃ§Ã£o bem casada na garrafa, uma garrafa bonita e interessante. JÃ¡ no copo Ã© bem mais comum, um dourado levemente translÃºcido e sem muita espuma Ã© normal para as cervejas do tipo, sem chamar a atenÃ§Ã£o demais. O sabor Ã© levemente amargo, sem exageros, deixa um sabor mais suave, mais ligado a uma cerveja mais comum, como a Pilsen, se sobressair, algo bom e levemente diferente, sem sair demais de um sabor mais comum de cerveja e sem colocar nenhuma mistura muito incomum, Ã© uma cerveja um pouco mais forte e sÃ³ isso, algo muito bom de saborear praticamente a experiÃªncia inteira. Durante a degustaÃ§Ã£o nÃ£o hÃ¡ muita variaÃ§Ã£o de sabores, tanto em goles mais curtos, quanto nos mais longos, o amargor diferente toma a boca com certa facilidade, e depois vai suavizando com o tempo deixando um sabor mais conhecido e tranquilo de saborear, nada muito diferente, mas bem interessante e refrescante. No geral, uma cerveja muito boa, que nÃ£o sai demais do tradicional, mas que consegue num simples diferencial, dar outra cara Ã  experiÃªncia, que Ã© boa, interessante e constante como um todo. #XinGourmet #GuiasLocais #LocalGuides #TheBeerPlanet #TheBeerPlanetClub #BeerKing #BeerKingStore #BeerKingClub #Jacobinus #BierspezialitÃ¤t #Classic #Eschwege #Alemanha #Ã¡gua #malte #cevada #lÃºpulo #levedura #cerveja #pilsener

Barley Creek Atlas Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Strong Ale - English;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;I was a bit disappointed with this beer. I may had too high of expectations as I was hoping for an Arrogant Bastard or a Wailing Wench. Appearance: Served a dark brown color mostly opaque with a bit of a cloudy gritty look to it. Smell: Slightly sour apple and brown sugar aroma. Taste: *VERY* very sweet! borderline cloying. Granny smith, Werthers Originals candies, and caramel candies are swirled in the extremely malty thick sticky taste. There is only a hint of muted sour / bitter in the finish. Big sweet taste but not balanced and not what I was expecting from an American Strong Ale. Mouthfeel: Thick and sticky. Like a Wee Heavy style beer. This is not bad, I like a thick heavy beer but not what I was expecting from the style. Drinkability: I am sorry to say that even one pint glass was a bit much to get through. Pleasant taste but *extremely* heavy. Hope this is helpful. Cheers!

Barley Creek Atlas Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Strong Ale - English;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewery. Pours a rich brown color with a thick tan head.

Barley Creek Atlas Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Strong Ale - English;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;This beer is very malty and it reminds me of port, except with less alcohol. Because it has 8% alcohol, they wonâ€™t sell it outside of the tap. That is a shame because it is very well balanced, a great beer for cold winter nights and it has a nice finish to it. But I donâ€™t blame Trip one bit for not wanting kids in our area to have this in a keggar. I detect shades of caramel and apple in this beer but its not overly sweet. This beer is the reason I keep going to Barley Creek.

Moat Mountain Cathedral Ledge Lager;North Conway, New Hampshire, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Moat Mountain Smoke House & Brewing Company;In short: A clean and crisp well malted golden lager perfectly balanced by a generous but smooth hop profile. Superior session golden lager. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Clear dark golden body topped by an off-white ring of foam In long: Nose has a good amount noble leafy hops and some candy. The attack is some crisp candy/caramel/toffee. The leafy hops quickly take over a kick the sweetness away but without providing much bitterness or dryness sensation. This bear is clean, crisp and more clean and crisp. This is far from the rustic unfiltered Viennas that are served in Vienna Country &#40Czech Republic&#41 but I can really appreciate this beer as a superior dark lager session beer. Best beer Iâ€™ve had from this brewpub. Named after a place where people gather up to listen to a grown-up that doesnâ€™t have sex &#40except for occasional pedophilia&#41 tell them to worship a long-hair jobless dude who transformed water into wine &#40exact vintage unkown&#41.

Phillips Organic Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Phillips Brewing Co.;"Too mellow, like a hippie. Yellow. No detectable nose or taste. Unimpressed with this Phillips offering; itâ€™s no wonder they put this one permanently to rest."
Phillips Organic Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Phillips Brewing Co.;Amber color. Sour apples and oranges dominate the nose. The palate is sour with apples and cinnamon playing a background role, however the body is a little watered down. The finish is malty and sour.
Phillips Organic Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Phillips Brewing Co.;"Never a fan of big name brews, the Pale Ale was probably the first style I tried when I dove into the world of craft beer and for several years, was one of the staples on my lists of favorite drinks. Although my palette has since matured and my fondness for this style waned, I will still fall back to it once in a while when I spot something different. According to literature on the bottle, it's claim states ""brewed with the finest organic micromalted Canadian barley, organic hops, pure water, and our signature yeast."" Recent discussions of Organic beers spiked my curiosity on Phillips Brewing Company's ""Organic Pale Ale."" Unfortuantely, much like its Maple Cream Ale reviewed previously, this too, really lacks any hearty personality or redeeming characteristics to make it an enjoyable brew. Sold in standard 650ml brown bottles, a quick shake of the bottle reveals considerable large chunky sediment specs, but not like that of Belgian yeast elements, this one presents more a speckled appearance, similar to that of partical board and wood chips. On the pour, it presents a fairly large rocky head, which disapates quickly to reveal a very think surface froth, considerable lacing and a small tight collar. Visually, the beer is VERY pale in color and more closely resembles a lager or pilsener than that of a Pale Ale. Aroma wise, it presents a very minute amount of hops and a mellow malt blend on the nose. But doesn't present any sigificant bouquet to enjoy. The same holds true on the palette, with everything being severely muted and accented with a calming malt effect. Aftertaste is very short lived revealing little more than a mild malt effect after a few seconds. Brewed dated as September 2002."

Caramel and toasted bread in the flavors. A little chewier than the filtered version, dry with some yeasty notes too. Clean finish.
Alpine Tamarack;Oroville, Washington, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Alpine Brewing Company (WA);Had this on tap at a tiny beer festival in Vancouver, about 8 years back. I remember tasting it and being blown away by the resemblance of this beer to true Bavarian treats. Fresh grain aroma and flavor through and through. Itâ€™s so good I can still taste it all these years later :-) Wish there were a brewery like this in my hometown. It won indisputably at that festival too!
Alpine Tamarack;Oroville, Washington, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Alpine Brewing Company (WA);Very nice amber color and even better unfiltered. Brewed by German immigrants who take great pride in their product. A visit to their brew pub in Oroville, WA is recommended.
Alpine Tamarack;Oroville, Washington, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Alpine Brewing Company (WA);Light amber with off white head. Good light malt nose. Malt flavor throughout with clean finish. Have only had this at festivals, will have to visit one day.
Bitter End Peach Lambic;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Cloudy golden color. Some head with little lacing. Barn yard/horse blanket nose and taste. The peach has almost completely disappeared from the flavor. Chalky texture and dry finish.
Bitter End Peach Lambic;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Another great brew from Timat Bitter End. Poured in a snifter. Peach in color. Light light yellow pinkish orangeish hue. Nose is incredibly sharp. This was my first Lambic so my palate was really overwhelmed by the sourness. I couldnâ€™t make much else out. The peach honestly wasnâ€™t noticeable, but Iâ€™m certain it was in there. Aftertaste is nice and dry. GREAT BREW Grat
Bitter End Peach Lambic;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Hay and rye bread malt (M); barnyard and leather yeast (H); peaches and sour white grapes. Deep peach body is slightly hazy with nice carbonation. Moderately sweet, moderately acidic flavor becomes a moderately acidic, moderately sour finish. Medium body, watery/oily texture, lively carbonation. The bottom line is: I could easily mistake this for a Cantillon brew...simply beautiful."
Bitter End Peach Lambic;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Hazy yellow, like a weizen, only little carbonation. Not peachy--a hint in the aroma, then nothing else. Lovely sourness and restrained tingle on tongue. More boldly ""Cantillon-esque"" than other American lambics--a worthy contribution, though not without its faults."
Bitter End Peach Lambic;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Clear yellowish appearance. This was similar to their ""Lip Burner Lam-Beak"", except it didn''t have as much of the pungent vinegar aroma. A bit less tart as well, still somewhat sour. The peach flavoring is only slight and it comes out toward the end. This might be a good ""gateway"" for me to finally start appreciating lambics."
Triumph Snakebite;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Triumph Brewing Company;Amber and orange pour with white head. Aroma hints of cherry. Taste is apple and sweet and sour cherry.
Triumph Snakebite;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Triumph Brewing Company;Draft at Triumph. Pours amber with a bit of white head. Head does not linger long. Too much sweetness, no distinguishable flavors or traits. Caramel malts are about the only thing I picked up on here. No carbonation or balancing bitterness.
Triumph Snakebite;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Triumph Brewing Company;Drought. Vanilla aroma, creamy light beige head hazy copper color fruity taste slightly sour abrupt finish with berry aftertaste. Not bad bui not great either.
Triumph Snakebite;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Triumph Brewing Company;Draft. Pours an amber body with a thin white lacing. Apple tones, slick and tart with some fresh tart apples. Caramel and apple warming. I hated it.
Triumph Snakebite;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Triumph Brewing Company;Tap at Philly. Pours a very light appley amber copper with a decent foamy off white head. Aroma is nice cider, fresh pressed apples, light caramel malt, and some green apple skin. Flavor is zesty apple, tart acidity running through the middle to cut the sweetness of both the apple and the light crystal malts. Ok blend of cider and ale. Fairly smooth and easy to drink.
Triumph Snakebite;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Triumph Brewing Company;Tap at Philly location. Pours golden orange with a bright white ring. Nose is sweet, taste is appely, spicy drinkable ok.
Triumph Snakebite;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Triumph Brewing Company;This is one of those beers that takes a couple of samples to rate accurately. Aroma is like sour apples with a malt sweetness. Pours a nice amber with a good head. Flavor is tart apples with some beer i9n there somewhere. The more I drank the better I liked it. Finishes quite sour and dry.
Triumph Snakebite;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Triumph Brewing Company;on tap-pours a quickly dissipating white head with copper/orange color. Aroma is sweetness, fruity. Taste is apple cider, sweet, faint malt&hops. OK carbonation. Good cider/OK beer.
Triumph Snakebite;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Triumph Brewing Company;Pours golden with white head. Aroma is mostly apple cider. Light refreshing mouthfeel. It is supposed to be a half ale and half cider blend, but the cider really dominates here, and I am not a cider drinker.
Triumph Snakebite;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Triumph Brewing Company;Very light amberish gold, creamy white head. Soft nose of apple and hints of vinegar. Flavor is lightly tart and appley throughout. Light bodied, soft carbonation, dry, fruity finish. Easy drinkin for a warm summer day, but truly not my thing here...
Holsten DiÃ¤t Pils;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);From old tasting notes. Clear green gold color. Thick white head. Faint sweet pop-like aroma. Somewhat dry bitter hop flavor throughout. Flavor becomes increasingly dry and somewhat astringent.

Holsten DiÃ¤t Pils;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);(Bottle 33 cl) Aparently Holsten invented the diet-pils for diabetics - what a pathetic claim to fame... Apparently the secret is to let the brew ferment longer, thereby leaving no residual sugars. The beer is pale golden with a limited head. Expectedly dry without much bitterness. An unusual deal. 021199

Reudnitzer Ur-Bock Hell;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);I liked this beer very much when I lived in Leipzig. Nice to drink on a cold day particularly. However, it is beer that grows on you and maybe the first taste is not so wonderful to some palates.
Reudnitzer Ur-Bock Hell;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);It smells sweet, malty, a bit alcoholic. The taste is darkamlty, malty, a bit bitter. In the aftertaste a bit more bitter. OK 9/9/9/10/9/9

Reudnitzer Ur-Bock Hell;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);"Sorry for the german rating, but this is a lousy rating from my ""newbie"" time (2007-2009), and itâ€™s not worth of being translated. I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! Ins Glas ergieÃŸt sich ein amberfarbenes Bier. Die Krone ist halbhoch, flacht aber sehr schnell ab. Der Geruch ist malzig wÃ¼rzig, der Antrunk erfolgt stramm malzig und stark wÃ¼rzig, eine leichte SÃ¼ÃŸmalznote tut sich hinzu.

Zum Mittelteil wird das Bier wÃ¼rziger und krÃ¤ftiger und ist nun weder besonders mild noch besonders wÃ¼rzig.

Reudnitzer Ur-Bock Hell;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Bottle from Kappldav123, thanks! I remember enjoying this bock from tap in 1993 or so in the brewery. And now? Pale amber color. Malty, slightly buttery aroma with a hint of toffee. Malty flavor, alcoholic and sweet, with hints of toffee. Bready somewhat flowery finish..
Reudnitzer Ur-Bock Hell;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Bottled. A golden beer with a white head. The aroma has notes of malt and fruit as well as lighter notes of bread and caramel. The flavor is sweet with notes of caramel, bread, and malt, leading to a lightly bitter and rather sweet finish, where the alcohol comes out and tickles the palate. Thanks yespr for sharing.

Reudnitzer Ur-Bock Hell;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Bottle, shared by yespr. It pours a clear, golden body with a small white head. Burnt plastic like aroma with cooked vegetables. Malty aromas too, and a little fruityness. The flavor is much the same, with the unwanted burnt plastic and notes of cooked vegetables. Pale malt and some fruityness too. The finish has some bitterness added to the initial flavors. Medium to full body. Not a very pleasant bock. (080822)
Reudnitzer Weihnachtsbier;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Malziger und mittelwÃ¼rziger Antrunk. Im Mittelteil rÃ¶stiger, die WÃ¼rze weicht etwas, das Bier wird weicher, es kommt eine leichte Herbe hinzu. Im Hintergrund ist das Bier dagegen milder, wie Erzengel bereits erkannt hat fehlt es etwas am KÃ¶rper. Im Abgang etwas hopfiger, gleichzeitig auch bitterer werdend. Das Bier bleibt dabei im GroÃŸen und Ganzen weich und ist so sehr sÃ¼ffig. Durchaus ein leckeres Bier! Danke an kappldav123 fÃ¼r das Bier.

Reudnitzer Weihnachtsbier;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);The bottle looks good, the beer in the glass also. Starts spicy and dry, very zippy. Well balanced, spicy finish, very drinkable. Good festbier!
Reudnitzer Weihnachtsbier;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);"Deep clear gold; good white fine head, leaving fine lace. Piney nose, rich malts, mostly light but some Caramalt too it would seem. And a bit of the drains. Dry, bready taste - not specifically dark German bread, rather fresh, white bread. Alcohol very obvious for rather middled ABV, also in the taste, giving it a grain-spirit character. Fleetingly bitter impression. Dry, alcoholburn; medium bodied. Aftertaste is again liqueurish; sweet & alcohol. A beer that overshoots its ABV and category by far. Very difficult one to classify - or to appreciate fully."
Reudnitzer Weihnachtsbier;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Bottled. Golden with an ok head. Sourish aroma with some maltiness. A papery mouthfeel with some bitterness.

Reudnitzer Weihnachtsbier;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Bottled. Light orange golden colour. Fine, sudsy, white head that dissipates to just remnants. Cheep corn syrup aroma. Medium to low bitterness and medium length on the palate. Didn't really detect the spicyness romoured to be in this one.
Reudnitzer Weihnachtsbier;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);i thought this would taste something inbetween the pils and the bock and they were both drinkable but this wasnÂ´t. maybe i was supposed to let it mature until christmas day but in my mad rush to taste every beer brewed in leipzig that wasnÂ´t going to happen
Florival Winter/Hiver;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);The Christmas ale in this commissioned series, and though it is apparently claimed that this is brewed to an original recipe, it was just an alias of Affligem NoÃ«l when it was first launched in 2003. Bronze coloured beer with off-white, thick and frothy head, sweetish with spicy notes (coriander), caramelly malts, sourish accent, candi syrup touch, some warming alcohol in the finish. Easily the best of the Florivals - but still not convinced this is an original recipe nowadays!
Florival Winter/Hiver;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Sehr voller, sÃ¼ÃŸer Duft - aber irgendwie komisch, erinnert an Curry. Der Antrunk ist sÃ¼ffig-sÃ¼ÃŸ. Im Hauptteil macht sich ein klebstoffartiger Geschmack breit, ziemlich unangenehm (schmeckt wie Uhu riecht). Im Nachgeschmack wird das Ganze etwas hefig-mild, der komische Geschmack verfliegt ziemlich schnell. Auf der Zunge bleibt eine muffig-sÃ¼ÃŸliche Malznote zurÃ¼ck. Ein sehr sehr merkwÃ¼rdiges und schon ziemlich ekliges Bier. Es ist sehr komplex, aber hat was von flÃ¼ssigem Klebstoff... 4/7/7/4

Florival Winter/Hiver;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);#731 Dunkelbraun und leicht trÃ¼b im Glas. Der cremige Schaum ist leicht brÃ¤unlich. SchÃ¶nes aleartiges Aroma nach rÃ¶stigem Malz. Im Antrunk dann hefig-malzig. Kaum sÃ¤uerlich, eher trockene TÃ¶ne, die bitter enden. Leider ist die Alkoholnote stetig vorhanden und drÃ¼ckt auf die SÃ¼ffigkeit. Weniger Alk wÃ¤re hier zweifelsohne mehr gewesen. Die Flasche selbst ist mir zu kitschig geraten, aber noch akzeptabel fÃ¼r die kalte Jahreszeit. Insgesamt kein wirklich gelungenes Weihnachtsbier!

Prickelnder, schwer malziger Antrunk, der durch den Alkoholeinfluss sehr schwer wirkt. Auch im Mittelteil bleibt das Bier schwerfÃ¤llig, der Alkoholeinfluss ist deutlich erkennbar. Eine herb-saure Note mischt sich hier ein, wirkt aber unpassend neben dem schwerfÃ¤lligen Aroma. Im Nachgeschmack wird ads Bier etwas saurer, die Malzigkeit trockener. Kein Highlight!

Mack White Xmas;TromsÃ¸, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mack Ã˜lbryggeri;"A Christmas beer for the ""cool"" ice beer generation - oh my God! Well, it''s probably not exactly an ice beer, just the average bland lager with just a little more flavour to pretend it''s a ""Xmas"" beer. Pathetic! The ice beer generation will probably stick to ice beer or pils for Christmas anyhow, so why bother? 0,5 liter can in white and silver, commercial description in English only, even though the beer is sold primarily (or solely?) in Norway. Wow - cooool! - (can''t believe there are assholes who actually think so!) Low head, golden colour, just a faint trace of spice (cardamom?) in the flavour. Aftertaste is weak but not foul, at least they have had the decency to add some hops to the stuff."
Olde Auburn Amber Ale;Auburn, Alabama, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Olde Auburn Ale House (AL);on tap-pours a white ring for a head and copper color. Aroma is medium malt-some sweet, fruity. Taste is medium malt-caramel/peat/chocolate, some earthy/copper hops.

Granville Island Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);I really like this beer and have added it to my top listed beers. Nice thick rich full taste with a sweet honey aftertaste. You can only have a few of these before the sweetness becomes too much.
Granville Island Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Bought a few cases when I moved to Vancouver. Almost no head, several bottles were almost flat. Tasted better than most GIB brews, but thatâ€™s not saying much. Odd aftertaste, almost like licorice and cloves.
Granville Island Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Another seasonal release from Granville Island, I really like this beer. The colour is a dark, ruby red with an off-white head. The aroma and taste are both quite good, with a slight sweetness imparted by the cherries at the end, without being syrupy.
Granville Island Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Strong clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg as well as ginger in the spicy aroma. Deep red, bing cherry or garnet color. Some cherry in the aroma too. Enters clean but bursts with spicy flavors. Reminiscent of some tripels. The mouthfeel could be a lot smoother. Some sour notes in the rich and fruity aftertaste. Warming and a little like brandy. This beer has changed in different vintages. The 2003 was exceptional, and I give extra points because that incarnation of the Christmas Ale was memorable.
Granville Island Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);On opening and pour:a beautiful dark cherry colour with a small tan/red hued head.the smell is malt and plums. On taste: you would never know this beer is 8% Starts sweet and sherry like,but quicky goâ€™es to christmas cake and plum.The cherrys come out in the middle and finish,this beer is not,but,almost too sweet.Just enough hops to kill the sweetness. Good body and nice to drink,a real fine beer from granville island

Granville Island Christmas Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);2003 edition Dark copper red colour with very little light pink head that rapidly disappears. Aroma of dark malt, molasses, and cherries. Very strong malt flavour up front, with a slight taste of cherries on the finish. Feels very rich in the mouth, but finish is cloyingly sweet. Okay for warming up after being out in the cold, but Iâ€™ve definately had better. I was expecting more cherry character.

Tons of spice aroma -nutmeg, cloves, and orange. Reminds of a holiday ham. Not too sweet though. Malt character limiting. A decent offering. 2003: Had his one at a holiday party (not the best tasting environment). Seemed a lot different (better) from the 2002. Sweet, malty, hints of tart cherries and belgian yeast all mixed-up.

Medium haziness. Taste: low to medium sweetness, low bitterness, low sourness. Not very intense flavors of toasted malts, fruits, dark dried fruits. Very subtle hints of caramel and banana.

Church End Rest in Peace (RIP);Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Church End Brewery;"Reddish half hand-pulled at the brewtap. Lots of alcohol, faint caramel and wood flavours (hops?). Nose rubbery and slightly sickbowly/citric like strong industrial cider. Increasingly musty hop presence as it warms. Not enough malt, caramel, complexity or anything but alcohol to really make much of an impression. Dull strong ale awash with Bavaria Red almond ethanol notes 533311 (Re-rate, 2005 vintage, cask handpull at the brewtap, Xmas Eve) Clear red amber with an initial collar diminishing to nothing. Jammy faint peach and apricot aroma to begin with, blending into Strawberry Chewit once the headâ€™s gone. Tropical and stone fruit to fore; pineapple, peach and apricot. Wring of Warthog. Grass, almond and what tastes like oak creeping in, giving the alcohol away. Splash of mouthwashy harshness. Apricot and hop marmalade. Unsticky and still-bitter fruity sipper. Actually pretty very bloody good. All credit to Church for trying something like this."
Church End Rest in Peace (RIP);Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Church End Brewery;Hand pulled at the Anchor, Birmingham, during Church End Weekend. Red gold, no head. Smell = clay, in a naan bread context, with some mulled berries also. Flavour is strong bricks, red berries + warm, mushy Xmas flavours hinted at too. Unbalanced. Random. Spins out on finish.
Church End Rest in Peace (RIP);Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Church End Brewery;An unusual beer. Amber/gold colour. I can see why its described as a bitter as it doesnâ€™t really have the depth, fruit or power that you normally find in beers of this strength. But, whilst it has some hop, the levels are not that high and nor is the bitterness. Some residual sweetness. Perfectly pleasant but doesnâ€™t quite hit the spot. It just doesnâ€™t somehow have a big beer feel to it. On the other hand, its dangerously easy to drink for a beer of this strength. Cask (gravity dispense), White Cliffs Beer Festival, February 2005.
Church End Rest in Peace (RIP);Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Church End Brewery;Feb 2005 Dover Fest. Sweet and pleasant. A mildly hoppy pale beer. OK.

Church End Rest in Peace (RIP);Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Church End Brewery;Well, it looks like a malt licquor.

Hampshire Californian Red;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Brown Ale;Hampshire Brewery;Bottle conditioned. Chestnut red colour, good but thin white head and moderate condition. Aroma started with chocolate malt and caramel before an unusual earthy woodland note took over. Chocolate again in the mouth but with a sneaking suspicion that someone has dumped some tree bark in my beer. Mascerated twigs and moss in the aftertaste. Ooh look, a rabbit! Weird, highly drinkable and English, how bizarre.
Hampshire Californian Red;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Brown Ale;Hampshire Brewery;"Brewed to celebrate California''s craft brewers. This is a deep red beer with a light fruity aroma. Sweet malts are followed by pine needles (!). This beer doesn''t quite cross the ""over bitterness line"". Good."

Fruity sugary strawberry-like aroma with mealy grassy notes. Some yeast and herbs, too. Dry-sweetish alcoholic vodka taste with fruity notes. This is what I got initially.

Sleeping Lady Urban Wilderness Pale Ale;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sleeping Lady Brewing Co.;[Tap] Tried this at the brewpub in mid-September. Pours a shade of amber with a large foamy head. Nose is mainly of floral hops and grainy malty notes. Caramel, herbal astringency, bitter hops and mild soap in the taste. Slick mouthfeel. Average carbonation levels. Not a ton happening with this one.
Sleeping Lady Urban Wilderness Pale Ale;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sleeping Lady Brewing Co.;Draft at brewery: Amber-orange with a thin head. Medium body. Lots of caramel, toffee and toast, but only a mild sweetness. Moderate hops but subdued aromas. Sessionable, albeit unexciting.

Sleeping Lady Urban Wilderness Pale Ale;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sleeping Lady Brewing Co.;"Wow - be careful of this one! My can (brought back from Anchorage to Washington) exploded and leaked a bunch out of the malformed top, but luckily didnâ€™t fully explode - so I could sample it. As I cracked the top open (jammed something into the mouth hole), there was another explosion (pressure releasing) and the pour was very slow, since 90% of the beer was head. Crisp cola/iced tea coloured body with an obviously huge tan head thatâ€™s all soap bubbles. Aroma of funky soap, cardboard and stale malt - nothing pleasant at all in here. Medium to Light-bodied; Assertive funky malt and nutty flavours with a lot of peanuts and some soap mixed in. Aftertaste shows a very slight amount of stale hops with more stale malt and a touch of gross bitterness from soap here. Overall, not such a great beer and the whole experience was rather offputting. I enjoyed the can, but not when it explodes, even if its been a few months and came from ~5000 miles away. I sampled this twelve ounce can purchased from La Bodega (Formerly Yukon Spirits) in Anchorage, Alaska on 26-June-2010, sampled at home in Washington on 16-September-2010."

Sleeping Lady Forty Niner Amber Ale;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeping Lady Brewing Co.;[Tap] Tried this at the brewpub in mid-September. Pours a light amber color with a nice cap of beige head. Sticky and sweet aroma of light brown sugar and caramel malts. Sweet malts, dinner rolls, mild nutty notes and toasted bread in the taste.

Sleeping Lady Forty Niner Amber Ale;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeping Lady Brewing Co.;Draft at brewery: Rich malts ... too sweet for me. Notes of caramel, maple syrup and molasses were too strong. Light toast, butterscotch and honey-covered nuts, too. Moderate hops with hints of grass and herbs, but not nearly enough to counteract all the sweetness. Too cloying as well.

Sleeping Lady Forty Niner Amber Ale;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeping Lady Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub, July 10. Attractive color and decent flavor for an amber. I definitely tasted the hops and malt, and thought it was pretty well balanced, with just a touch of bitter and a hint of toffee.

Sleeping Lady Forty Niner Amber Ale;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeping Lady Brewing Co.;stopped by snow goose for some food, wasnâ€™t too impressed with the forty niner, not much flavor and didnâ€™t really compliment the steak...

Sleeping Lady Portage Porter;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Porter;Sleeping Lady Brewing Co.;From draft at Snow Goose in Anchorage. Looks like a porter. Minimal head. Mild aroma of chocolate grain. Taste is chocolate malts and sour. Somewhat cloying. Just ok.
Sleeping Lady Portage Porter;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Porter;Sleeping Lady Brewing Co.;"on tap @ Snow Goose / Anchorage AK --- This review should be taken with a ""grain of salt,"" because I suspect that either the lines werenâ€™t cleaned properly today, or the batch is beginning to turn. I looked over the other reviews and they have a consensus of impressions that donâ€™t sync with mine. For me, taste begins with semi-sweet malt that grows awkwardly into cedar and a bit of dark fruit, then abandons everything by completly shutting out hops in a finish that continually grows sweeter and more woody. Canâ€™t be what the brewer intentioned."

The head was off white to tan color. Aroma was nice chocolate and light coffee. Taste is dark chocolate with soft coffee and roasted malts that is robust at first but drinks rather smooth.

Watch City Pie-Eyed Pumpkin Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Watch City Brewing Co.;2004 draught @ the Brewery. Dark orange brown, not altogether unlike DFH Punkin, but has less of a head on it, transluscent body. Aroma of light grains, some root-like spices (ginger perhaps???). Very odd. Flavor proves to be equally strange. Itâ€™s not overspiced, it just has the strangest mix of spices Iâ€™ve tasted. Itâ€™s slightly astringent, slightly metallic, very herbal. Medium to medium light bodied, little to no pumpkin flesh apparent. Low sweetness to start, some wateriness apparent through the body. Waxes sweet on the end. [2.9] Rerate January 2005. Much better than remembered. Bigger body, like a thick amber ale, with a lovely amount of allspice and cinnamon lingering on. Very flavorful, not nearly as watery. Though I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™d like to think that they improved on their first release. Kinda like what Ramstein did with its winter wheat this winter. Very cool of brewers to be always looking to improve and rerelease.[3.8]
Watch City Pie-Eyed Pumpkin Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Watch City Brewing Co.;Very nice! A medium-bodied brown ale with pumpkin flavor.

(Bump up rating)

Aroma is bready, sweet (pumpkin), and a bit spicy (nutmeg and cinnamon). Flavor is a bit bready to start, sweet with the squash coming through strong in the middle, the spice comes through w/the pumpkin as well, finish is a little spicy. Medium bodied, quite drinkable, although the sweetness might get to be too much after a few mug fulls.

Wonderful clear, reddish, dark amber colour with average, thick, fluffy, moderately lasting minimally lacing, off-white head.

Harvest Moon Middlesex Porter;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Porter;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);Dark brown with solid tan head and good lacing.

Fischer Adelshoffen Blonde Beer SpÃ©ciale;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fischer (Heineken France);Flip-top 65cl brown bottle, picked up during a beer raid into Europe at a Channel port booze warehouse (Pidou in Dunkirk actually, donâ€™t you know?). Best before Aug 2009, drank Aug 2008. Poured most into a Duvel glass and the rest (for the wife) into a Veltins Pilsner stemmed tulip glass. Looked good in both glasses, large white head, which stayed for a while before fading to a clingy covering until the end. Mid amber body with good carbonisation rising through the beer. Yeast, straw and hops vie for a place in the aroma, none of them winning, so a mixed bag for a smell. Very dry and bitter taste, not what I was expecting at all. I had been cutting logs and generally getting sweaty before I had this and wanted something refreshing, wrong choice. Not sure what to add, without slanging it off, which would be a bit unfair. Strange beer, looks good and is well packaged. It just doesnâ€™t deliver what it appears to promise. Nothing wrong with it, but it didnâ€™t Rock my Boat.
Fischer Adelshoffen Blonde Beer SpÃ©ciale;Schiltigheim, Alsace, France;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fischer (Heineken France);500ml bottle I drank probably 5 or 6 years ago, I got it from the ANBL location in Fredericton. A little sad to see they went out of business, but given the $5/bottle price tag and the poor reviews on here itâ€™s not shocking. Despite the negativity here, I rather liked this beer, although it seemed rather odd for a blonde. The colour was a fair bit darker than Iâ€™d have expected and it had a bit of a hops and alcohol bite to it.

Michelob Seasonal Brew All Malt Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Appearance: Pours a bright, deep golden body with a medium white head. Smell: Toasted grains and very light caramel with soft musty, floral notes. Taste: Exceedingly mild malt flavor and sweetness. Barely a dash of Noble-esque hops. Finishes relatively sweet. Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: Refreshing, inexpensive, and not nearly as bothersome as the vast majority of the other macro beers, so really I canâ€™t complain.
Michelob Seasonal Brew All Malt Lager;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"I am only rating this because it is a big step in the right direction for BMC beers. Pours a honey gold with a spritzy head that instantly fades. Lots of honey and caramel in the nose, possibly diacetyl as well. Lively carbonation. The body is light and drinkable, with subtle notes of hay and dough. The hops are barely noticable, but do add a slight grassy note to balance things. This isnâ€™t my favorite style by any means, but this easily rises above all the other ""adjunct"" ridden beers in its class. Hopefully this all-malt idea catches on with the masses."

TwoRows Barleywine;Dallas, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;A reasonable stab at a world-class west coast barleywine, however it fumbles the ball and just becomes overbearing in the final analysis. Super fruity aroma over a cold water caste, vanilla-esque from the alcohol. Creamy, coating head. Medium, lightly hazy cherrywood color. Lacks the complexity fo the Pacific bruisers, but pretty well done for heavy-handed hopping. Citrus, wood, cream, well-bittered. Finishes a bit too bitter for a bit too long.

Ettaler Kloster Edel-Hell;Ettal, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Klosterbrauerei Ettal;500ml bottle. Poured a mrky amber with almost no head. Must have gotten an old bottle, the look and taste of this was off. Over ripe dark fruits, very little hop notes. Down the drain with most of it.
Astra SÃ¼nde mit AntÃ¶rner;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bavaria-St.Pauli-Brauerei (Carlsberg);"This was a quite unique experience. According to the label the beverage has 80 % beer and 20 % ""of something else with caffeine"" I can''t taste the beer. the drink reminds me most of all of Red Bull. However it is pretty refreshing. It has a strong smell and taste of artificial cherry."
Granville Island Lions Winter Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Aroma is malty, a bit spicy with a hint of chocolate. The taste is not what I expected: chocolate and lots of it.A bit of caramel and vanilla as well. Not unpleasant at all.
Granville Island Lions Winter Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);This â€˜wasâ€™ a great beer in the past, but this 2018 winter season, my first try of the season, this beer has gone down hill dramatically with the full Port background in past years replaced by what tastes and smells like artificial coffee and fake chocolate flavours and aromas
Granville Island Lions Winter Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);BiÃ¨re dessert qui ne fera pas trop grossir, la Winter Ale est trÃ¨s parfumÃ©e sans pour autant avoir une grande complexitÃ©. La vanille domine tout ici, mÃªme si sucre brun, cacao, gateau Ã©picÃ©e se laisse goutÃ©. Le problÃ¨me c'est que la vanille semble artificielle ce qui la dissocie des saveur de malt et houblons qui semble avalÃ© par la levure. Je la prÃ©fÃ¨re en bouteille qu'en canette car plus caractÃ©riel.
Granville Island Lions Winter Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);A sugary sweet aroma, with notes of coffee and malt, pours a clear dark reddish brown color with a thick tan head. Taste is sweet almost has a maple syrup taste, notes of vanilla, coffee and sweet malt. Body is a bit thin and the finish is sweet malt.
Granville Island Lions Winter Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Bottle in Canada. Aroma is chocolat much, cocao, overwhelming. Poured dark amber, no head. Taste is chocolat, nuts, heavy sweetness.
Granville Island Lions Winter Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Hazy brown with a quick dissipating head. Smell is 90% chocolate, like a hot cocoa powder. Taste is predominately sweet. Again, chocolate with cream. There's some hop presence, but it's drowned in sugar. Not what I would expect a winter ale to be.
Granville Island Lions Winter Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);"It's a great cold winter evening sipping beer. Malty, dark amber-copper with an off-white head. Coco + flowery hops aroma; sweetvmalt caramel toffee/fudge taste with early notes of vanilla. Smooth, creamy and easy to drink while the snow is coming down. Great on-mountain snowboarding brew. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Granville Island Lions Winter Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);"Pours clear, light cola with a medium sized foamy burned butter head. Big nose of chocolate, with notes of mild leafy hop. Flavour is extremely sweet. Lots of chocolate cookie dough, and vanilla. Traces of wood and earth. Herbal hops. Touches of berry tart. The description is weirdly non descript. ""Special"" this, and ""Premium"" that. Not 100% sure this is always consistent. It's definitely tasty for a winter sipper. Don't think I'd want to have more than two in a row. If it weren't for some bitterness, this would be quite cloying. Body is deceptively medium/thin. It actually has the same or more chocolate in there than Rogue's or Young's Chocolate Stout. Caramel/Molasses. Definitely has the Tootsie-Roll flavour many other raters describe. Is that a good thing? Maybe. It would be a good introductory beer in a flavour profile. More of a chocolate porter than an ESA. Chocolate and Crystal malts. Not sure if there is oatmeal in with the malts or not, but more would make it luscious. Finish is quite sticky. Enjoyable."
Granville Island Lions Winter Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Can. Tootsie roll aroma. Sort of messy Tootsie roll aroma with fruit... Like a Tootsie Pop I guess. It's drinkable but not my first choice in winter ales.
Granville Island Lions Winter Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Best on tap (draught.) If in bottle or can then pour into separate glass. Requires less agitation than a lager of course. Vanilla w caramel. Great beer on a cold day. Garbage beer on a hot day.

Intensely malty and astringent hoppy with full red fruits, grapefruits, caramel and toast. Flowery with nice strong sweetness. Spicy, very oozy piney with strong lemon to round. Very strong and nice! Hoppiness: Strong citrus, floral, spices, strong resins, lemon and strong grass in nose. Strong grapefruits, floral, spices, pine, very strong resins, lemon and sharp grass in taste; Bitterness is very strong for a lasting, very high astringent bitter sweet Amber malty finish. After taste: Quite dry. Very oozy citrusy and strong bitter to mouth. Comments: What can you do to make it a simple Amber Ale even better? You do it like this one: turn up the volume with full-on toasty red fruit and caramel maltyness, plus massive hopping to the point that astringency not bitterness overtake the palate, with very citrus oozy taste but stopped just short of being uncomfortable. Strong and effective, recommended!"
Ballast Point Tongue Buckler Imperial Red Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Bottle. BB 16.01.2020. Sweetish, jammy. Iron hints. Bog berry bitterness. Crispish, but relatively easy-drinking. Piney-resinous dry on the palate. Boggy kinda. Medicinal / cough syrup hints, especially in the finish.

Ringnes Juleklassiker;Oslo, Norway;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);21/12-02. Bottle: Dark clear amber colour, nice head. Aroma of caramel, dark chocolate, and alc. Flavor is almost the same here. dominated of caramel and alcohol. Maybee a bit unbalanced. Medium body, and a medium malty/alc finish.
Ringnes Juleklassiker;Oslo, Norway;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);"The last few years Ringnes have, in addition to their normal ""klasse F"" Christmas beers, brewed a ""Juleklassiker"" (Christmas classic) which changes every year, and allegedly is based on old recipes from the various breweries that have been engulfed (and in many cases closed) by the Ringnes group. Last year it was Aktiebryggeriet i Oslo, this year it's Ringnes' own recipe. As a gimmick every bottle is numbered, I had number 37089! This beer is not ""golden"" like the label says, it is reddish brown (the label mentions that Ringnes brewed its first pilsener in 1877 - irrelevant information, as this is definitely not a pils!) - its flavour is very close to the weaker Frydenlund BayerÃ¸l (Munich dunkel) though some may prefer to call it a Vienna (who the hell cares - the term ""Vienna"" is unknown in Norway, even if our numerous Christmas beers belong to the borderland between dunkels and Viennas). Anyway this is a good beer, but it could use some heavier malts for its strength (6,5%). Not as spicy as the normal ""klasse F"" Christmas beers. Good with food though."

Brew Brothers Antonios Original Garlic Pils;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);"Garlic good, beer good; garlic and beer in the same bottle = bad. At least this came in a nice swing top bottle. From the instant the stopper was popped, yikes!! ....rather a strong garlic smell like a punch to the nose. I was expecting ""some"" hint of garlic but nothing like this. Onward I ventured, pouring the slightly cloudy medium gold, with the modest white head. Coming from the bottom of the bottle was what I thought might be sediment, but I caught it just before ""it"" went into the glass, ""it"" turning out to be two slices of garlic. Nice save, and into the loo they went. Aroma was garlic, and the taste was well, garlic. Mouthfeel was hard to judge, my mouth being overwhelmed by the garlic and the aftertaste was garlic. Mightâ€™ve been an okay pilsner but for the garlic. Would not and could not ever drink this again. ps All this garlic had an extreme laxative effect within the hour. Could this be worse than the infamous Chili Beer?"
Brew Brothers Antonios Original Garlic Pils;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);I want to first note that my review will be biased on Aroma and Flavour, because I ABSOLUTELY ADORE garlic. Now, with that said: A terrific nose! Garlic wears a nice coat over light hops. Not much else but delicious garlic bread in the mouth. I did catch a wisp of the ale and it truly seemed like nothing spectacular. Moderate feel in the mouth, nothing exciting. A taste to suite my palate, but Iâ€™m sure not that of the everyman.
Brew Brothers Antonios Original Garlic Pils;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Is this retired now? I had this a while back at the Garlic restaurant near the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton. A curiosity really-- a pale lager that has been steeped in garlic (indeed, the beer comes with a little garlic clove in the bottom of it). At first it is off-putting because you canâ€™t taste the beer behind the garlic (but once you get your food, which also is made with several pounds of garlic per entree), and your palate becomes absolutely pummeled by garlic, THEN the shitty pale lager component of the beer shines through. As I said, a curiosity more than anything worthwhile.
Brew Brothers Antonios Original Garlic Pils;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);bottle. thanks to Jesse for sharing this world class beer. pours a yellow-golden body with small specks of presumabley garlic. aroma is pungent as all hell! very garlicy and not much else, it actually fills the room. Well there isnâ€™t much to expect from the flavours either, with garlic itâ€™s pretty much overpowering in all respects and thatâ€™s not entirely a good thing as others have pointed out. Itâ€™s only interesting for about a second and I canâ€™t imagine anyone actually drinking this except for the novelty.
Brew Brothers Antonios Original Garlic Pils;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Uhm. Wow. Aroma is garlic bread. Not beerlike at all but it sure smells good. I can kind of taste some beer behind the garlic. An interesting taste - just one I hope to never experience again.
Brew Brothers Antonios Original Garlic Pils;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);I like garlic. It helped that in transporting back to Toronto, the bottle got a good shaking up, and not too much sediment of garlic taste, and so the creamy head top overflowed the first third of the pour. Points for originality. Too bad this place is finito,
Brew Brothers Antonios Original Garlic Pils;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Golden beer with a freakin garlic floating in it. Fresh malty nose with AWFUL garlic sell. The taste of garlic is cloying and needs to be eliminated for any further tasting. Little body or hops in this beer. Interesting maybe to make a nice vinaigrette.
Brew Brothers Antonios Original Garlic Pils;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Slight haze, minimal head. It looked a bit like ole root beer. Unclean spice, garlic salt aroma . Highly repulsive . Salt , old oil , garlic , dust . Horrible combination . Thank you
Brew Brothers Antonios Original Garlic Pils;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Hazy light golden color. Huge sharp and acidid garlic in the nose, if it was anything else, it probably wouldn't be so dominant, but what do you expect putting a garlic chunk in a pilsner? Some sweet malt in the body, but the garlic barely makes an impression (which is good). Not as bad as one might think.
Brew Brothers Antonios Original Garlic Pils;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);(5oo ml bottle) Thanks to Kimchee for this fabulous experiment! Pours clear gold with a thin, white head. Garlic butter nose. Flavour is more oily with an overpowering garlic taste. When the clove slid out into Doug's glass I honestly thought someone had spat a loogie in the bottle - I nearly threw-up! Not complex at all and won't likely have again but was fun.

Served way too cold, flavor enhanced as it warmed.
Pizza Port Ale Nino;Solana Beach, California, United States;Brown Ale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);This is a strong brown ale. A very alcohol and nutty aroma. The appearance is a murky brown. The flavor is very sweet and a bit too much so with some nutmeg, caramel, and sour cherries. This does not hide the alcohol well at all. Its ok in small amounts.
Pizza Port Ale Nino;Solana Beach, California, United States;Brown Ale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Couldnâ€™t quite get into it after drinking Hop15 for 6 hours. Initially it tasted like a dopple bock, then the yeast mad it taste more Belgian. Had a lot of alcahol to it also. Dark sweet, malty and spicy with some bite to it, sums it up for me
Pizza Port Ale Nino;Solana Beach, California, United States;Brown Ale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Pours a deep brown hue with a slight off-white head with aromas of roasted malt and slight yeast. Mouth feel is meduim to full bodied with the initial mouth taste being belgian-style yeast. The flavor mellows as it warms and other flavors follow suit with brown sugar, roasted malts and a little more yeast.
Pizza Port Ale Nino;Solana Beach, California, United States;Brown Ale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Pours with a deep amber brown/mohogany body, topped by a medium thick head with little lacing.

Aroma is intensive dark chocolate, ash, raisin, molasses, a bit of green hops. Medium sweetness, light bitterness from roasted malt. Medium carbonation, higher than it's usual. Does not feel too heavy. Solid.
Port Brewing Santas Little Helper;San Marcos, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Port Brewing Company / The Lost Abbey;Bottle. Aroma- nice, roasted coffee, with some sweet cocoa and a bit spicy notes (something like vanilla and cinnamon). Pleasant and well-balanced composition, but on the other hand- could be a bit more intensive. Black, unclear, with a medium-low, creamy, brown head. Taste- it's better, much stronger, roasted coffee, which brings even some typical, but not very disturbing sourness. Then come cocoa and still clear spiciness, which adds some sweet feeling. Nice, medium-low roasty bitterness in the aftertaste. Medium-high-bodied, quite smooth, with a low carbonation. Very solid Imperial Stout, but it doesn't blow off my mind.

Rich roasted malt aroma with notes of chocolate, coffee, licorice and some vanilla. Pours deep brown with half a finger of mocha brown head that has excellent retention and good lacing. Starts with rich roasted malt, chocolate and licorice flavors as well as having a rich, full body and slick viscous mouthfeel. Finishes smooth with coffee and a little bit of vanilla flavors.

Pizza Port Double Overhead Abbey Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);On tap at Toronado SD. Clear reddish auburn with a small off-white head, fading to a ring rather quickly. Smells like New Belgiumâ€™s Abbey with a tinge more toasted malt and light chocolate, slightly more banana. Flavor is much the same with a moderate alcohol presence and bitterness at a 3, dry.moderate prickly carbonation with a medium full body. Just a Tad better than NB. Stupid autocorrect. . .
Pizza Port Double Overhead Abbey Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Bottle, courtesy matta. Pours a dark copper hue, thin white head, and sticky lacing. Caramel nose, raisin, some wet wheat. Flavors of caramel, raisin, some chocolate in the distance, some sour tart punch in the finish. Spicy, full body. Has a lot of age on it. Would have been better fresh.
Pizza Port Double Overhead Abbey Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Bottled at RBSG thanks to Christian! Poured deep medium caramel with a swirly cap of beige head. The aroma picked up toasted lighter fruits, showing plenty of oxidation.. darker fruit and caramel came on the second wind.. quite sweet overall. The flavor was sweet again with caramel and medium-skinned fruits paired with spicy lighter fruit skins and some raw alcohol.. finished dry and spicy with some tart and yeasty notes. Medium-bodied and a bit more sour than Iâ€™d like.. interesting evolution.
Pizza Port Double Overhead Abbey Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Bottle @ RBSG guessing from AlohaC Christian or some one else old school. Pours orange with a bright white ring. Nose is fresh and sweet. Taste is sweet and fruitty and very nice. This is a cool brew.

Pizza Port Double Overhead Abbey Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Orange-dark amber in colour, off white coloured head, average retention, good lacing. The aroma starts off quite sweet, lots of fruit (apples and some peach), lots of yeast, bready, really fresh. The flavour is yeasty upfront, lots of apple tartness, good fruit sweetness, very light spice, a rather unusual sourness although this is a good thing. Tart mouthfeel, medium body, high carbonation. Finishes long and tart, lots more fruit, dry. This is good, a different take on a double. Iâ€™m liking the angle that they take with this one. 750ml bottle obtained in a trade with DarkElf, thanks Stephen. Opened on February 16, 2007. Bottle #155, Vintage 2004.
Pizza Port Double Overhead Abbey Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Bottle. Warm, coppery brown with an off-white head. Medium body with fizzy carbonation. Aroma of fruit, funk and honey. Biscuit, spice and fruit flavor. Dry, nutty finish.
Pizza Port Double Overhead Abbey Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Bottle. #155. Pours a bright brown-ruby body with a creamy, medium-size white head. The aroma has a solid fruit constituency (apricot, peach) along with bready yeast. Fruity, funky acidity in an oily body. Interesting profile, as others mentioned this doesnâ€™t appear to be a double, but I still found it to be quite enjoyable. Thanks for sharing, radiomgb.
Pizza Port Double Overhead Abbey Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Doesnâ€™t really seem like a double if that was the intent. Tart, doughy, orange citrus aroma. Hazy browned copper coloured body is topped by a decent but diminishing off white head that does leave some sudsy lacing. Tart orange and strong grapefruit citrus hops overwhelm the malt body. Chaotic fruitiness leaves the flavour unfocussed. Somewhat watery texture with gassy strong carbonation. Bottle (trade, May-05) sampled with MartinT and Rastacouere. Thanks, DarkElf!
Pizza Port Double Overhead Abbey Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);From the bottle. Very fruity spicy cherry with sweet malts and nice spice. The alcohol shows a bit in this beer, but the malts are fantastic, very fruity and great caramel flavor. Beer was a bit light on the palate and lacked carbonation.
Belgian Passions Comics & Beer Triple Blond;Silly, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie de Silly;Another unique beer dumped on the Australian market. Cloudy light amber with a generous fluffy white head. Strong, sweet belgian yeast aroma. Some spicy plum pudding notes. Strangely underwhelming flavour, but itâ€™s well balanced. Seems fairly sugary, even for a belgian, but it doesnâ€™t seem too sweet on tasting. Pleasant if not challenging.
Belgian Passions Comics & Beer Triple Blond;Silly, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie de Silly;Another high rating to add to the evidently volatile opinion of the Aussie contingent! This is one good looking beer. Thin head on pouring and excellent visual complexity - cloudy orange glow lightens notably to a dull gold at the edges. Powerful nose, well cooked malts, not roasted (if that makes any sense), a touch sugary. Impressive. palate has power but lacks the smooth, well integrated structure of the nose. Big malts, stewed, some blocky alcohol notes, but settles nicely nicely in the back palate.
Belgian Passions Comics & Beer Triple Blond;Silly, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie de Silly;5 Mar 06 - Spiritous spicy malt hop aroma. Cloudy yellow-brown colour, good retaining head and suds lacing. Big spiritous spicy fruit malt flavour. Tangy hoppy malt aftertaste.
Belgian Passions Comics & Beer Triple Blond;Silly, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie de Silly;10th Aussie to rate this one! I guess us Aussies must be able to get this one fairly easily. Spice hop malt aroma. Murky yellow colour with great head and lacing. Spice malt hop flavour with spiritus. Smooth palate.
Belgian Passions Comics & Beer Triple Blond;Silly, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie de Silly;Mystifying name but an interesting tripel. I found this very satisfying. Lemon marmalade colour, with a towering frothing head. Aroma had banana and honey notes. Creamy mouthfeel, smooth and very drinkable for its 9% abv. Flavour palette dominated by wheat, lemons and cedary hops. Very well balanced for its strength. (Bottle, 2003)
Belgian Passions Comics & Beer Triple Blond;Silly, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie de Silly;Bottled: The lables had fallen off this bottle and I had to work backwards to figure out what it was, quite an amusing exercise. Bottle conditioned judging by the floaties in the glass, horse blanket yeast aroma with some honey and fruit. Somewhat peppery but the alcohol in pretty-in-your-face instead of being a background player. Easily enough identified as a triple, but not a particulary good one. Had to identify the beer using the bottle and cap in the end. Not Sillys best beer.
Belgian Passions Comics & Beer Triple Blond;Silly, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie de Silly;8th Aussie rating! I grabbed this one cos it was the only one left that I hadnâ€™t rated! Colour was a murky pale straw with a large frothy head that left an odd shaped egg in the foam. Wheat and yeast on the nose. Alcohol shows in the taste, some pepper, coriander, sweet and not that well balanced.
Belgian Passions Comics & Beer Triple Blond;Silly, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie de Silly;The 7th rating and the 7th Aussie. Just like some of the other Belgians (Caporal comes to mind) it appears that we are the dumping ground for some of the inferior stuff. The silliest thing about this beer is that I had to hand over a $10 note for this beer and a small handful of loose change. The other silliness is that, as described, it just lacks the presence of other beers of this kind. The most noticeable aspect of the beer is the lack of real integration of alcohol, hops and malty body and mouthfeel. Enough said, except 493, the number of this rating.
Belgian Passions Comics & Beer Triple Blond;Silly, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie de Silly;"Well Silly by name (brewery and Beer) in this case turns out to be silly in just about ever rating category. Medium hazy honey with huge, almost joke-like erectile, craggy icecream sundae style off white head. Mild yeast, wet mown straw and overly fruity aroma. Thinish low carb characterless body. Not well integrated. Big yeast and milder floral honey sweet flavours. Kinda reminds me of an over sweetened Belgian home brew gone wrong. The closest thing I have tasted to it is a Belgian ""fruit shandy"" - Belgian ale mixed with tropical fruit flavoured soda water - truly silly and not even a beer clown."
Belgian Passions Comics & Beer Triple Blond;Silly, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie de Silly;This beer just lacked body and persistance of flavour. The picture says a thousand words about this beer, COMIC.

Oettinger Urtyp;Oettingen, Bavaria, Germany;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Oettinger Bier Gruppe;Sampled from 0.5 l bottle from local 'toom', best before April 2018. Clear, dark amber with a medium large, frothy, slowly diminishing, off-white head. Sweetish, slightly malty and a little grassy aroma of grains, straw and a touch of caramel. Moderately sweet, slightly bitter, a bit malty and slightly grassy taste of grains, some caramel and hints of straw, followed by a short, moderately bitter, slightly grassy and quite yeasty finish with a metallic touch. Thin to medium body, slightly effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. One of the worst I've had from Oettinger so far, pretty yeasty as if something went wrong here, didn't like it at all!

Bitter End Bitchin Camaro;Austin, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Had on tap at Uncle Billyâ€™s. Was told this was the same recipe as used at the Bitter End by the bartender, so Iâ€™ll put the review under here for now... Poured a very dark crimson color, almost brown with just a small head. Smell was hoppy and zesty and almost rye like. Taste was a balanced hoppiness with again zesty, hearty notes of rye like grain and malt. Very nicely balanced and easy drinking enough for beginners but tasty enough for everyone. Not a traditional Joe Schmoe Amber, and a nicely done beer.
Bitter End Bitchin Camaro;Austin, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;On draught. Amber/orange color with nice lacing.

Hazy golden-amber with a tight white head. Muted aroma, but what I could find seemed stale to me. Flavour was pretty standard for the style, but again, somewhat muted and stale. This staleness seemed to appear in a lot of their beers - maybe they just havenâ€™t had a lot of turnover through the holidays? Whatever the case, thereâ€™s no excuse for serving stale product at a brewpub, and my ratings reflect that.

Piece Festivus;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a dark hazy mahogany brown with a small off white head. Aroma is sweet, candyish in a way, dark fruits and some spice notes. Flavor has some dark fruit, prune and plum notes along with a light spice, touch of roast, oddly not much alcohol noticeable which makes me wonder if this is truly 9% as they say. Considering itâ€™s moderate body and complexity I was amazed that I wasnâ€™t tasting some hint of booziness. Not too bad.
Piece Festivus;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;On tap at the brewpub. Poured a cloudy dark brown with a red hue and a light brown head that dissipated to the edges. Aroma had sweet grain, some nuttiness, a nice spice note and a bit of light fruit.

Piece Festivus;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;I thought this was fairly tasty but a bit thin. It was darker in color than in flavor. But that being said I still liked it. Serving: Tap

Nose is muted, though I do get pleasant cloviness and stone fruit, mild roastiness as well. On taste, pretty pleasant with a very dubbel type character, roasted and dark crystal malts at the forefront with a nice soft body. plums are in there as well. Pretty tasty stuff.

Samuel Smiths Cider Reserve;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;Samuel Smith;Keg @ Cittie of Yorke, London. Pours clear gold. Fruity medium-sweet nose. Pleasant medium character, stewed fruit, some unexpected smoky notes, light skin. Not bad, just unsure about the smoky elements.
Samuel Smiths Cider Reserve;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;Samuel Smith;Crisp apple cider with a very light citric pressence wich makes it rather enjoable. Fizzy. OK cider
Samuel Smiths Cider Reserve;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;Samuel Smith;Keg at Ye Olde Swiss Cottage. It pours clear golden with with a small fizzy white head. The aroma is sweet, sugary, cheap apple juice, earthy, light barnyard and apple pie. The taste is initially crisp, plenty of sugary sweetness, apple juice from concentrate, appletiser and candy with a touch of dryness through the finish. Light - medium body and fine, effervescent carbonation. A bit sweet and one - dimensional. Fair at best.

Hopdaemon British Museum Beer;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;Not impressed. Tony Prins of Hopdaemon Brewery wins the contract to brew the house beer for The British Museum, and he produces a product which tastes like your worse nightmare out of a tin. Stale, flat and metallic. Being as positive as possible the taste could be described as iron fruit, and the tinny dry twang at the end could be called a gentle citric hoppiness, but when I consider that tourists from around the world are going to drink this as an example of British beer, I don''t think I should be that kind. This is revolting! This is not British beer!
Merchant Ale House Dark Wheat;Saint Catharines, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Merchant Ale House / Murray Street Brewing;Nice amber coulour with a white foamy head. not a complex flavour, some hops, roast malts and wheat. Decent beer though.
Merchant Ale House Dark Wheat;Saint Catharines, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Merchant Ale House / Murray Street Brewing;as i write this, one week ago exactly, i was sitting in the Merchant Ale House in St Catherines, Canada drinking this beer on draft .. . light mud and fresh wheat .. some mud aftertaste .. . muddled and not that enjoyable .. . . When you tell on someone, youâ€™re not only telling on them. Youâ€™re telling on yourself
Merchant Ale House Dark Wheat;Saint Catharines, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Merchant Ale House / Murray Street Brewing;I really enjoyed this one, it had a dark colour and it is bitter at the front and smooth taste all the way through, it had a sweet finish and good beer, I would have again
Merchant Ale House Dark Wheat;Saint Catharines, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Merchant Ale House / Murray Street Brewing;On tap at the brewpub. Dark yellow, medium white head. Decent wheat and malt aroma. Taste is quite bland but there is is wheat and malt notes here as well. Some hops in finish. Nothing wrong here, I just found it boring.
Merchant Ale House Dark Wheat;Saint Catharines, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Merchant Ale House / Murray Street Brewing;"Draught at the Merchant Ale House. Hazy golden-orange colour - not very ""dark"", really. Aroma is odd - a bit candyish, some funk (maybe thatâ€™s the ""vomit"" that jerc found?), some chemical/plastic notes - like I said, odd. Flavour is quite dead to start, developed into some stale fruit (peach, orange) and hop notes, and got unpleasantly bitter in the finish. I really didnâ€™t care much for this."
Merchant Ale House Dark Wheat;Saint Catharines, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Merchant Ale House / Murray Street Brewing;Hazy golden amber, with a very small white head and half decent lacing. Citrusy aroma, bit of stale hop/lemon/vomit (but not actually)/and grass notes. Light lemon citrus hoppy bitterness. Light tart wheat bite, but other than that it is not very wheaty. Average to light palate. Tasted more like an american style wheat than a dunkelweizen. Meh.
Merchant Ale House Dark Wheat;Saint Catharines, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Merchant Ale House / Murray Street Brewing;Draught. At Merchant Ale House, shared with jerc and GregClow. Poured cloudy deep amber with a thin white head. Mild aroma of thin caramel malt, light tea hops, hint of sour fruit. Taste was surprisingly citrus hoppy, if somewhat stale, with toasty grain, tea, and as it warmed something sour that wanted to resolve into chocolate, or chlorine or something unpleasant. Mouthfeel bitter, sourish, average body. We felt this one had been on too long, probably would have been quite decent if fresh, as it was, somewhat disappointing.
Merchant Ale House Dark Wheat;Saint Catharines, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Merchant Ale House / Murray Street Brewing;"Cloudy, orange hue typical to darker wheats. Just average crown. Spicy nose with biscuit character, clove. Neat mouth feel, good texture, well rounded malts; noticeable hopinnes makes decent session ale."
Merchant Ale House Dark Wheat;Saint Catharines, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Merchant Ale House / Murray Street Brewing;a different take on a wheat, to give it more depth. Drinkable with the slice of lemon not on its one. Little lace. Darker colour, watery, aggressively carbonated.
Merchant Ale House Dark Wheat;Saint Catharines, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Merchant Ale House / Murray Street Brewing;(Draught) Thin, almond head with a copper doy. Citrus and slight hop nose. Caramel, citrus and hop tongue with a nice bitter finish.
Fegley's Brew Works Belgian Dubbel;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fegley's Brew Works;Clear copper color with no head. Aroma of caramel and fruit. Flavor of fruit with some caramel. Not too sweet. Decent beer, but weak for the style.
Fegley's Brew Works Belgian Dubbel;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fegley's Brew Works;Although not an outstanding dubbel, I think it is quite average and drinkable for the style
Fegley's Brew Works Belgian Dubbel;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fegley's Brew Works;Amber with a short, small head. Weak flavor, a slight tingly malt flavor. No discernable fruits, not sweet, very empty... Extremely disappointing beer.
Bitter End Dunkel Weiss;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;I thought it had a pretty good flavor, but it was kinda watery. Just a slightly punchy version of their normal wheat, darker in color of course too.
Bitter End Dunkel Weiss;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Not very dark in color or flavor for something calling itself a dunkel. Creamy head. Sweet, banana flavor, somewhat candylike. Reminds me of the Rockin Rogger served down the street at the Copper Tank. Simple flavor but I like it. Nice clean finish.
Bitter End Dunkel Weiss;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Seasonal offering... Lemony hints, but slightly watery, growing more watery as it warmed. Hazy amber, retaining a ring of head. Lacking interest, overall.

Huttenkloas Winterbok;Hengelo, Netherlands;Bock - Doppelbock;Huttenkloas;Bottle from Kisjes Slijterijen, Meppel. Aroma is strong dark malt, caramel, dried fruits, raisins, with some strange vegetable off-flavour in the finish. Flavour is sweet and moderate bitter. Body is medium. Unfortunately, the off-flavour ruins a potentially decent Doppelbock.

Four Peaks Fools Gold;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Tap at Tempe. Pours a clear golden color with a white head. Aroma is of spicy earthy saaz hops and malt. Flavor is crisp, spicy hops, caramel malt, finish is very clean and refreshing. Great summer brew.
Four Peaks Fools Gold;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);A quality brew from Four Peaks and another excellent brew for the beginner.
Four Peaks Fools Gold;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);On draught at Tempe brewpub: Clear golden yellow with a thin white head that does hav nice retention. The aroma is spicy, earthy, and floral hops (but not very assertive), light fruits, along with a hint of dusty malt. The taste is very crisp, clean, and yet round, creamy and full. The carbonation is moderate, yet sprizty and lively on the tongue, while the body is light. Flavors of spicy/grassy/floral hops come through, but by no means are anything like an IPa, along with sweet fruit, light earthy bread, and doughy malts. Very approachable for the average drinker, and not the imperial/harvest/double barrel-aged type thatâ€™s going to get talked up on ratebeer, but a very solidly brewed beer all around.
Four Peaks Fools Gold;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draught at the brewpub. Clear golden color with thin white head. Sprucy noble hop aroma with a hint of cereal grains. Grains dominate the flavor with a touch of sweetness. The finish is somewhat bitter. Nice beer.
Four Peaks Fools Gold;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);This beer has a nice creamy, pale colored head. The beer itself is a full gold color and is quite clear. The aroma is fruity with notes of apricot and peaches. This beer is quite smooth and creamy on the palate up front. There is a light bitterness in the finish, which definitely matches the dominant hoppy fruit notes quite well. I get notes of apricots, and sweet citrus fruits like grapefruit. This is nice and light on the palate and it goes down so fast, and I still want there to be more in my glass. This is so nice, refreshingly hoppy and light, perfect as a summer quaffer.
Four Peaks Fools Gold;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);tap at the brewpub-pours a golden yellow hue with a nice white head. big grainy/spicy german hop aroma. flavors were haygrass, lemon and big spicy german hops. pretty decent for a light beer from this brewery!
Four Peaks Fools Gold;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Complex is right. No aroma to speak of except a little bitter. Gold color to it. Had a bland flavor to it may have to go back and have one more to get a better sense of this beer Tap. Had a full glass this time rather than sampler glass. Aroma something was there but hard to explain maybe some fresh sent of hand soap. Staw body with white head. Flavor had a mild bitterness to it like most swill. But if this was served in cans like Miller or Bud maybe more people would drink it.
Four Peaks Fools Gold;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Golden yellow with small head and lacing. Light hops and citrus aroma. This is a is very good, easy drinking beerwith a crisp light hops and citrus flavor.
Four Peaks Fools Gold;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Summery lager nose - floralish hops, toasted malt. Hoppier than the nose suggests, earthy bready malt, tingly bready finish.
Four Peaks Fools Gold;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Light golden color. Aroma is nicely balanced with the malt and hops, faint earth tones. Medium bodied, not complex though but smooth with a little bite. A good summer starter beer.
Wye Valley Dorothy Goodbody's Winter Tipple;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;Cask at Birerria Paradiso. Red-amber color with a big, lasting sparkler head. Spices, caramel, and light dough aromas. The flavor is upfront with cinnamon and nutmeg spicing. Malty as well, with caramel, toasted bread. These combine with moderate citric hops to give a dark orange spice-cake flavor. Pretty full bodied and smooth for 4.4%, but the lack of any alcohol presence reminds you of its lightness. Pretty cool sessionable winter ale that might not really be a warmer, but gets interesting and balanced spiced-cake flavors in, which are often not my thing.
Wye Valley Dorothy Goodbody's Winter Tipple;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;(cask @ The Old Toad - Rochester, NY) Copper color with a nice tan head. Light aroma of malts and toffee with a light hop base. Taste is very smooth and malty with a hint of fruits, toffee, brown sugar and some hoppy bitterness. Smooth finish and very creamy.

Wye Valley Dorothy Goodbody's Winter Tipple;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;Burton Winter Fest. Golden brown with a small head. Aromas are caramel malts with hints of grapefruit. Flavours are fruity and quite malty with grapefruit bitterness on the finish. Also has some residual sweetness and sulphur. Like Oakham JHB but a bit more wintery. This version was at 4.7%
Wye Valley Dorothy Goodbody's Winter Tipple;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;Anyone expecting a winter warmer might be disappointed, as this is, in fact, a rather nice best bitter. Sure, it is a quite malty one, but that is undepinned by a a quite austere flinty hop bitterness. Finishes clean and slightly sharp. Not at all thick or sticky. A pleasant drop. Handpump, The Speaker, Westminster, London SW1.
Wye Valley Dorothy Goodbody's Winter Tipple;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;[Cask at Gullivers, Copenhagen] An amber beer with a fine light brown head.

Wye Valley Dorothy Goodbody's Winter Tipple;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;Served from a firkin. Aside from the attractive amber appearance, there's not much to recommend. Flavor is bland and lacks any complexity. Finish is mild and slightly bitter. Maybe it did not travel well across the pond.
Wye Valley Dorothy Goodbody's Winter Tipple;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;Cask Conditiones at The Stag's Head, Swalcliffe, Oxon. A dark brown bronze beer with thick white head. This is a bitter but fruity beer homing into Stout territory. Hard coffee, smokey bitterness initially which warms and fills into a blackberry fruitiness on the tongue. Not a strong as other winter beers and no alcohol glow, but nevertheless a pretty decent pint.
Wye Valley Dorothy Goodbody's Winter Tipple;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;[cask] Watery texture. Bitter. Unremarkable. I wouldn't call this a winter beer.
Fredericksburg Lindberghs Lager;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;"The best offering from this brewer gives the drinker a caramel malt flavor that is sweet and smooth throughout the drink. Hints of roasted malt add an extra punch. Got this one in a ""jug"" and Iâ€™m glad I did."
Fredericksburg Lindberghs Lager;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;On tap at the the brewpub. Pours a medium to dark amber, white, light but frothy head. Aroma has some hints of caramel, pleasant. The flavor has a unique blend of Christmas spices, caramel and nuts. Reminds me somewhat of a Sam Adams, Mouthfeel is decently thick for a lager. Would go good with food.
Fredericksburg Lindberghs Lager;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;Served way too cold! Decent malt flavor with a slightly hoppy finish....just a beer.
Fredericksburg Lindberghs Lager;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;Light amber, clear. Served slightly above freezing temperature. As it warmed the malts were kind of nice but there really could be some more strength to this. I''m sure it sells well.
Fredericksburg Honey Cream Ale;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Cream Ale;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;Their weakest offering, intended for the macro drinkers. Not much aroma, some honey, but tasted mostly like water, seemed thin. Most people reading this would probably be happier with one of their other brews.
Fredericksburg Honey Cream Ale;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Cream Ale;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;I might have been sitting next to kaggie and pounder? Honey cream was not a good effort. Some hint of honey, but itâ€™s an ok beer to walk around with on a hot day.
Fredericksburg Honey Cream Ale;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Cream Ale;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub - pours a dark orange with a light white head. Aroma has some faint fresh lake accents. The flavor has some slight sweet honey notes, but not much else. Very smooth drinking, nut nothing to get excited about. Mouthfeel is not very creamy, in fact it turns a bit metallic near the end. Probably the weakest of the five I had on my visit.
Fredericksburg Honey Cream Ale;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Cream Ale;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;A nice, tasty little brew that is best enjoyed after a day at E Rock. Sweet, slippery, and satisfying- the honey is just noticeable enough, with the hops holding it back nicely.
Fredericksburg Honey Cream Ale;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Cream Ale;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;"One of the better beers from FBC. No idea wh they bill it as a light beer drinkers beer; It is not light at all but does have a sweet flavour taht any drinker can enjoy"
Fredericksburg Honey Cream Ale;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Cream Ale;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;This beer is billed as one that light beer drinkers would like....that made me expect some watery, adjunct crap. On the contrary, this beer actually had a decent, sweet flavor with an excellent hop finish.
Fredericksburg Honey Cream Ale;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Cream Ale;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;I have to admit that I wasn''t expecting much based on the last line of the commercial description. But I found the slight hoppy-honey taste pretty decent, with just enough flavor to keep things interesting. Being 4.7%, it''s not really a light beer by anyone''s definition, but I''d drink it again.
Panther Ice Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Malt Liquor;Cold Spring Brewery;This is not the first terrible thing to come out of Minnesota, and Iâ€™m sure it wonâ€™t be the last. Seriously though, you knew what this beer was all about just like you knew what that fat girl was all about before you brought her home that night in college. Anyone surprised by how terrible this beer is that actually takes the time top complain about it should be beaten severely about the face and perhaps also the head. This is the beer you buy to torture your friends or enemies and I have to believe the brewers of Panther Ice understand and embrace that. Celebrate it for what it is.
Panther Ice Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Malt Liquor;Cold Spring Brewery;It should be called sex panther. Nothing special whatsoever. The cheapness may dazzle the eyes but be weary, itâ€™s a trap!
Panther Ice Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Malt Liquor;Cold Spring Brewery;60% of the time it gets you drunk everytime. Fairly good ice beer much better than some Gluek offerings
Panther Ice Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Malt Liquor;Cold Spring Brewery;Good golden color,small white head that disappeared almost as soon as it hit the glass.Nasty corny sickeningly sweet aroma,some faint whimpy hints at hops but it might just be wishful thinking by my nose.The flavor was mildly sweet and cerealish cornflakes or total in taste,some faint hops in the end and a slight metallic taste as well in the very end.It will definately get you there if thats what your looking for but as far as taste goes this is not it......but it is better then some.
Panther Ice Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Malt Liquor;Cold Spring Brewery;RRRRAAARRRRR. THis panther has a bite! Try a 6 pack, and weâ€™ll see you tomorrow afternoon.
Panther Ice Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Malt Liquor;Cold Spring Brewery;Pale gold. Nose very corny. Flavor is sweet and corny, but at least it doesnâ€™t taste like napalm. The lack of a vile chemical burn is both surprising and pleasant, meaning this beer is actually drinkable. Comparably, itâ€™s nicely non-horrific, exponentially more not-awful than it should be. It even keeps a decent head and has some lacing. Amazingly near to somewhat average, instead of horrid.
Panther Ice Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Malt Liquor;Cold Spring Brewery;Surprisinging in its lack of offensivness. Maybe it is just that this was sampled side-by-side with Rockman High Gravity Lager, but I found this one to be palatable. This is especially surprising given the brewer. Thanks for the experience Dan.
Panther Ice Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Malt Liquor;Cold Spring Brewery;This didnâ€™t taste bad to me. It was cold and cheap. I was tired and thirsty and had been bicycling 15 miles. At times like that you can be grateful for just about anything, so it hit the spot, and had a nice alcohol content to relax me. Iâ€™ve tasted worse, trust me. I was curious about this cheap stuff, because I had tried Gluekâ€™s regular beer, which was also cheap but reasonably good for the price. This stuffâ€™s about the same quality and same low price, and has some pretty potent buzz potential to go wth it.But my next beer will be the other stuff I bought, i.e., Octoberfest. I only want one of these for now. .
Panther Ice Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Malt Liquor;Cold Spring Brewery;This was the best beer I have ever had. I first had it in Rochester Minnesota. And I have been hoping to get it out here in Illinois anytime soon.. If you like strong bottom of the barrell beers this one is definately for you. Thanks Melissa
Panther Ice Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Malt Liquor;Cold Spring Brewery;This was a tailgating gift from JMerritt. It had a malty taste that was a bit strong until you got used to it. I didnâ€™t have a glass so donâ€™t really know much else about it. Hope I never have it again - thanks JM :)
The Cowboy Kolsch;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Draft: Pale straw. Compact, but lapsing, white head. Cleanly minerally, Pilsner malt aroma with honeyed apple hints. Fluffy, semi-fuzzy carbonation. Skillfully balanced display of crispy, doughy malt and poignant hop spice. Nice integration of muted melon fruitiness and lengthy fresh baked bread flavors. Restrained apple acidity. Off-dry, invigoratingly hoppy finish shows a flash of mineral astringency which heightens the dryness and curtails the lush doughy malt remnants. A respectable attempt at a difficult style to brew.
The Cowboy Kolsch;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;This beer is a brilliantly clear, pale gold color and is topped by a frothy white head that is quite creamy in texture. There is a light aroma of spicy hops, and a hint of clean grain. This beer has a nice soft sweet grain character to it, but that is not all. A subtle spiciness, plus a bit of herbal character, runs throughout, and it finishes with a nice complimenting bitterness that is a bit more than I was expecting in a KÃ¶lsch. This is quite quaffable, and quite clean too, thought there is a hint of creamy fruitiness here. This is a really nice example of a KÃ¶lsch, and is certainly the best commercial one I have ever had.
The Cowboy Kolsch;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Had a stange aroma to startout with. Second sample tried strange odor not there. Oh well, nonetheless flavor was slightly bitter. Gold body with white head and some lacing. Refreshing but not much different from common swill.
The Cowboy Kolsch;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Light yellow with small head and lacing. Aroma is clean and crisp malt. Flavor is light malts with a light body. Light,easy drinking beer.
The Cowboy Kolsch;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;"Draught @ Papago The beer pours a lightly hazed gold with a modest and bright white head that is semi-creamy in texture, and the resultant lace a thin covering upon the glass. Nose is sweet malt; fresh and pleasing, start is sweet, malt profile adequate and the top thin. Finish is mildly acidic, the hops personable in their spicy bite, quite dry and a drinkable beer."
The Cowboy Kolsch;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Straw colored, clear. Aroma is medium grassy. Taste is medium grassy hoppy, decent bitterness, medium carbonation.
The Cowboy Kolsch;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;About as good as a lawnmower beer can get. Flowery hop aroma with hints of malt and a tiny bit of fruit. Crisp, clean malt flavor with some pleasant hops in the finish. Very refreshing beer.
The Cowboy Kolsch;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Clear, malty nose. Heady malt-flavor for a Koelsch, and airier too. Slight bitter finish. Quite good.
The Cowboy Hefe-Weizen;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;The Cowboy is out of business but I have to get my props in for this beer. This was the best hefe Iâ€™ve had, bar none. The banana / clove was perfect and this beer had a spiciness that was so complemantary that it nearly rendered the beer perfect. Great body, greath mouth feel. Itâ€™s just a shame most people canâ€™t appreciate good beer because losing this Gem was a tragedy for Scottsdale.
The Cowboy Hefe-Weizen;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;This beer is a pale, hazy straw color and it is topped by a creamy white head. The aroma is dominated by clove at first, but I quickly am able to get notes of banana as well. There is perhaps a hint of spicy/ tart wheat in the nose as well. The taste is soft and fruity up front, it then moves to notes of banana and spicy clove. The finish is lightly tart, with a slight bite from the hops. This beer is soft and creamy, yet it has a sharp spiciness to it all at the same time. This is really quite nice. There is a nice wheat character that is a bit tart. This is really a quintessential example of a Bavarian Hefeweizen
The Cowboy Hefe-Weizen;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Wow one of the first hefeâ€™s Iâ€™ve had on tap lately without a lemon for carbination. Hazy yellow body with white head and some lacing. Aroma you could smell the banana here. Flavor was also banana and also creamy. Easy drinking beer.
The Cowboy Hefe-Weizen;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Hazy yellow with a nice white head and thick lacing. Aroma is all banana with flavors of banana, malt, hops with a tangy spicy finish. Good refreshing Arizona beer.
The Cowboy Hefe-Weizen;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Draft: Foggy lemon. Tall, tightly packed white head is slow to recede. Soapy yeast, clove, white grapes, bananas, and airy phenols comprise the aroma. Soft body but equally firm and minerally. Rich banana and bright clove esters temper the immediate quenching lemony acidity. Husky malt base with fresh bready dustings sliced with plump lemon pulp flavors add more juiciness. Lack of dryness fails to highlight the spicy esters and subtler hop elements. Doughy yeast pervades with a partially gritty accent. Mashed plantains uphold the thinnish body. Straightforward, but delicious, clove-dusted doughy malt finish. Carbonation is low/soft for the style and lacks the crunchiness-turns-creamy texture. The body could stand to be yeastier and the estery flavors are a tad understated. Quite a polished example, though.
The Cowboy Hefe-Weizen;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Light clove and bananas. More subtle flavors than most, largely wheat. Doesnâ€™t knock you off your feet with sweetness. Fairly dry finish. Very creamy and not especially crisp. Apple abounds, not a lot of herbal bite. Light yeast and pepper as well.
The Cowboy Hefe-Weizen;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;"The beer pours to a slightly hazy deep amber color; the head is portly in size and the consistency creamy with the color an off white, as it slowly dissolves the resultant lace a fine covering upon the glass. Nose is slightly sweet, mostly malt with a slight hint of the wheat and a touch of banana, start is sweet, light malt profile, the top thin to light in its feel to the palate. Finish is perky in its acidity, the hops mellow and the aftertaste quite dry. A drinkable beer, but I think a bit ""Thin Waisted"", but it would make a good ""Arizona 118 degree Dry Heat"" Beer, and ""NO"" I don't any ""lemon"" in or on my beer!"
The Cowboy Hefe-Weizen;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Typical golden hazy color. Nice yeasty aroma. Crisp and clean on the palate. Rrefreshing just not quite there yet to a good standard hefe.
The Cowboy Hefe-Weizen;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Slightly hazy straw colored. Aroma is banana and clove, fairly strong. Taste is mild banana, fairly smooth with decent body.
The Cowboy Hefe-Weizen;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;I am not a wheat beer-drinker, but I thought this beer was outstanding. Aroma of bubblegum, yeast and clove. Brilliant banana and clove flavors, supported by a backbone of malt and wheat. Perfect balance and blending of flavors and aroma. I can say, without a doubt, that this is the only wheat beer I've ever tasted that I would drink again.
The Cowboy Pilsner;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Clear golden body with medium head. Medium Saaz aroma. Taste is mildly malty that finishes very dry and Saaz bitter. Slight skunkiness.
The Cowboy Pilsner;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;The brewer at this small, unpublicized brewery in Scotsdale is truly talented. Hardly anyone has heard of this place, even though the brewer has won multiple gold and silver medals in the largest national and international competitions. No I don't work there. This beer is clean and crisp, balance is slightly more bitter than most pilsners I've tried. Dry finish. Yet another beer style that this brewery has convinced me is worth drinking.
The Cowboy Pilsner;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Nice bubbly straw look. Sharp malted flavor, reminiscent of some of the best European pilsners.
The Cowboy Pale Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Hazy light orange with medium beige head. Aroma is moderaqtely sweet, mild grapefruit hoppy, slight skunk. Taste is medium floral hops, moderate malts, fairly smooth. Finishes nicely dry and bitter.
The Cowboy Pale Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Light yellow orange, with a nice head. Citrusy hoppy aroma. Excellent lightly grapefruited bite. Smooth, understated, with an IPA character.
The Cowboy Octoberfest;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Red with caramel nose. Nutty, roasted flavors. Very good in the classical style.
The Cowboy Belgian Strong Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Good golden color. Highly carbonated and easy to drink. Good finish. Some fruity smell.
The Cowboy Belgian Strong Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;A hugely nondescript beer. So bland I don't have any good adjectives to use. Stay Away!!
The Cowboy Belgian Strong Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Light orange with little aroma at all. Low key maltiness with a hint of sugars. Light and not what you''d expect from ''strong ale.''
Mishawaka Indiana Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Retired, wow. Took a bet on this 12oz bottle when I bought it from Super Liquor III, it must have been much older than I thought it was. Shared with robotopera. Hazy amber color. Thin off-white head. Decent bits of lace. A lot of caramel, spicy malt. Just a very light old hoppy citrusy spicy earthy taste. Tastes like itâ€™s got an unfortunate amount of age on it. Medium-plus body. Light carbonation. More dry texture, with a spicy bite in the finish. Moderate sweet taste, light bitter, and a big spiciness. This tastes like it might have been a solid IPA fresh, but thereâ€™s no way to tell at this point. If only there was a date stamp!
Mishawaka Indiana Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Weak and underwhelming. The bitterness and hop quality of this beer is less than good. Light aroma of bread and grass.
Mishawaka Indiana Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;I believe this beer was my introduction to microbrewed beer. I think they listed it at 6.4% ABV at the BrewPub. Itâ€™s been forever since I had it, but I remember it had a golden hue and a fair amount of bitterness for a rookie hophead. Lots of fun sharing pitchers of this after class with friends. Sadly, Mishawaka BrewCo is no more, so beware if you see this on shelves at your bottle shop, as it is no doubt well past its prime. At least grab it for the label and the memories, if you can get a deal.
Mishawaka Indiana Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Iâ€™m pretty sure we got a six pack that had gone bad because this resembled nothing that a pale ale brings to the table. If this was what the brewer intended to give us then this was the worst beer Iâ€™ve ever had.
Mishawaka Indiana Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottle: Poured a doodoo brown with off white head. Light hops aroma. Taste was butterscotch, light hops, a bit unstable and possible infected.
Mishawaka Indiana Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Pours bright golden in colour with very small white head. Decent floral hop aroma and taste. Very drinkable IPA, not super hoppy.
Mishawaka Indiana Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Poured a syrupy deep amber, not so much of a head. Excited to get this as an extra, but not really my kind of IPA. The nose was dominated by a malty-booze, coupled with the syrupy mouthfeel just wasnâ€™t my jam, almost thick in a way. Got to take my review with a grain of salt, iâ€™m completeley swayed by the west coast IPA, and it ruins me on other IPAâ€™s, i tried to rate with that in mind.
Mishawaka Indiana Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Bottle with thanks to coyotehunter. Pours copper/brown with little head and aromas of sweet sugary malt and herbal hops. Flavor is horrid. Sweet brown sugar collides with a herbal and medicinal hops presence to produce an absolute trainwreck. Thereâ€™s not much here that works.
Mishawaka Indiana Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Found this one bottled at a liquor store in St. John, Indiana, as part of a mix 12 pack of various beers from Indiana brewers. Hazy, medium reddish-brown pour, a thick, tan head, a nice balanced aroma with sweet malts and rosy hoppiness, balanced flavor, bitter but not offputting finish. Excellent.
Mishawaka Indiana Pale Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Copper-amber pour from a 12 oz bottle. Three fingers of solid, long lasting head. Lacing â€“ it almost coats the glass as the beer goes down. Aroma of sweet malt â€“ caramel and butterscotch â€“ with a notable hoppiness. Solid IPA flavor â€“ slightly sweetish start with a pleasant bitter hoppy finish. Not an extreme IPA but a damn good one.
Kraftbrau Q-Brew;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kraftbrau Brewery;Slightly musty odor--not sure what this is initially. Drinkable nevertheless. PsychProf was right in saying that these beers have a tangy sourness to them. Interesting.
Kraftbrau Q-Brew;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kraftbrau Brewery;Bottle: Not quite sure what style this is. Golden amber color with small white head. Aroma of yeast, wheat, and sugar. The body is light with an enjoyable sweetness with a sticky bitter finish. Pretty smooth overall. Still have no idea what this is, but I must say it was my least favorite beer I tried from Kraftbrau.
Kraftbrau Q-Brew;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kraftbrau Brewery;"""A novel beer"" - label. ""A lager that''s not as flavorful as some of our others."" - the barmaid. So, I had the sampler tray of 5 lagers and 1 ale. I was bummed because my absolute fav from the brewery is the Helles and they were out. The barmaid assured me they didn''t have any bottles either. So I saunter over to the brewery''s fridge (as you only can after a sampler tray in 30 minutes) and found 1 remaining Helles (treasure) and this concoction. It is an interesting blend of flavors, that''s for sure! Definite American Wheat components (tart/sweet) - chill haze plus some unfilteredness makes it look nice - Saaz aroma, but not the body to go along with it...in fact it was thin and watery. Yet...unusual in flavor. Yes, it''s a lager, but not one I''ve ever experienced! What the hell are these guys using that imparts that characteristic sourness? I am sure it turns some folks off."
Triple J Prairie Dog Porter;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Porter;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;Black and filtered. No head. Nose is minimal. Taste-a bit of roasted malt and not much else. This is brewed at JJJ Chophouse.
Triple J Prairie Dog Porter;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Porter;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;Brewery is now Triple Js but the beers are the same. Pours out a clear brown color with a small tan head. aroma is malty and somewhat sweet. flavor was a little bit malty but not much else going on there.
Triple J Prairie Dog Porter;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Porter;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;Surely by now, everyone knows that Porter is not one of my fave styles, but htis one had several redeeming qualities- the biggest being the wonderfull mouthfeel. It was like velvet in the mouth. Wasnâ€™t too ashy.
Triple J Prairie Dog Porter;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Porter;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;Dark, coffee-chocolate aroma, fairly typical porter but still decent. Nice smooth mouthfeel, best beer in the house.
Triple J Prairie Dog Porter;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Porter;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;Not a bad beer, but not GABF award winning IMHO. Very smooth, with a sweet mocha taste.
Big Buck Chocolate Stout;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Big Buck Brewery;Black body that is opaque. Some lacing and a small light brown head. Nose is chocolate, roasted malt and some sort of stale grain. Taste is sweet and smooth, with chocolate and a little bit of coffee. Much sweeter than the porter but lots of water in the taste and mouthfeel.
Big Buck Chocolate Stout;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Big Buck Brewery;"GABF â€™05. Listed as the ""Double Chocolate Stout"". Black body. Chocolate malt (strong), some coffee, and a hint of fruit in the aroma. Fermented fruit and tart chocolate malt in the flavor finishing w/ roasty dryness."
Big Buck Chocolate Stout;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Big Buck Brewery;(Gaylord Location) This is one of the better beers I''ve tried at this very commercial brewery. Thick, oily, black appearance with a thick, almost nitrogen, looking head. Chocolate is noticable in the aroma but the roasted malts predominate. Wonderfully sweet flavors of cocoa and traditional stout bitterness. A must try if its available.
Triple J Bills Yellowhouse Wheat;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;Brewery is now Triple Js but the beers are the same. another run of the mill wheat beer. nothing great here, but not too bad at all. cloudy yellow with a wheat beer aroma.
Triple J Bills Yellowhouse Wheat;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;Decent wheat and yeast profile, though they are definitely not going for the Bavarian style wheat. Good effervesence.
Triple J Bills Yellowhouse Wheat;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;tap at brewpub-pours a cloudy yellow hue with a small white head. subtle citrus on the aroma. decent palate for this style. flavors of haygrass, orange ,banana and some malt grain husks that add positive things to the flavor i must say. This would make a good quaffer during a TT game at the brewpub.
Triple J Bills Yellowhouse Wheat;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;Pretty good for a hefe....these beers typically get butchered by American brewpubs, but this one was in no way offensive. Had a nice citrus flavor, banana finish.
Triple J Bills Yellowhouse Wheat;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;-1 on appearance for the uninvited lemon, which distorted the aroma. Cirtic, floral, and soapy. Nice mouthfeel, mild flavor but rather well-balanced. Not bad.
Fegley's Brew Works Rude Elf's Reserve;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Fegley's Brew Works;Keg at Bethlehem Brew Works. Clear amber, large creamy tan head, good retention. Aroma of toffee, soy, cherries, clove, ginger. Taste is gingerbread, caramel, toffee, hints of cherry. Medium bodied, oily, a bit of booze. Medium bodied.
Fegley's Brew Works Rude Elf's Reserve;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Fegley's Brew Works;"Crisp copper and amber coloured body with a ruby glow and a thinnish tan head. Aroma of candy sugar, apricots, pit fruits, nice earth, caramel, toffee, rich fruits and a dose of floral hops, all with a good deal of alcohol as well. Medium to Full-bodied; Rich pit fruit flavour with a lot of sugars, some caster sugar, a lot of earthy and caramel malts and some light alcohol at the end that finishes fairly nice and smooth. Aftertaste has a mellow sweetness with a touch of grain, a lot of light sugars, a smooth alcohol burn and a touch of complexity near the end. Overall, a nice rich and fairly smooth beer for the style that shows nicely and has a good fruity sweetness with alcohol that is well hidden! I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Liqour Outlet in Boonton, New Jersey exactly a year ago on 22-December-2015 for US$2,42 sampled at home in Washington a year later on 22-December-2016."
Fegley's Brew Works Rude Elf's Reserve;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Fegley's Brew Works;I poured it from the bottle into a glass. It pours dark red with almost no head. The aroma is spice and dark fruit. The taste is spice, plum, other dark fruit, and booze. It had a strong, boozy taste to it. This was pretty good. I was expecting more though.
Fegley's Brew Works Rude Elf's Reserve;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Fegley's Brew Works;Draft pour at the Bethlehem location. Poured a clear copper color with a small off-white head. Aroma was lots of holiday spices. Coriander, nutmeg. Flavor was candi, brown sugar. Booze, but subtle. Nice!
Fegley's Brew Works Rude Elf's Reserve;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Fegley's Brew Works;"aroma is of faint malt and holiday spices. amber and clear in color with little head. taste is entirely of holiday spices; clove, nutmeg, cinnamon."
Fegley's Brew Works Rude Elf's Reserve;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Fegley's Brew Works;Had this awhile ago poured reddish amber with off white head. aroma cinnamon, nutmeg and the cloves. flavor got all of the spices with some alcohol
Fegley's Brew Works Rude Elf's Reserve;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Fegley's Brew Works;Draft at the Irish Pol. Clear dark orange brown pour with off-white foam. Runny lace mostly disappeared over time. Spicy malt brew with some dark amber fruit and vegetables. Brandy-soaked sugared pears. Clear candy toys. Nutmeg. Cinnamon. Clove. Peat. Celery. Ginger. Apricot cordials. Started off tasting sugary and simple but developed nicely as it warmed. Eventually feels surprisingly similar to many better Belgium Christmas brews albeit a bit rougher. Would have again.
Fegley's Brew Works Rude Elf's Reserve;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Fegley's Brew Works;Dark reddish tint, nice spice notes but not overwhelming. A bit of an aftertaste, but overall not bad for such a high abv. Will buy again.
Fegley's Brew Works Rude Elf's Reserve;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Fegley's Brew Works;Not my favorite Xmas style beer. A bit of an aftertaste that made it off putting. Deep red and hazy. Spices and ok and not overboard. Heavy abv, but not worth the drink if you can get a better drink for your drunk! Tap
Fegley's Brew Works Rude Elf's Reserve;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Fegley's Brew Works;Damn, so much spice. Too much spice? Certainly is a Christmas inspired ale. Belgian yeast comes through, sweetness of the malts and possibly Belgian candied sugar.
Deus Brut des Flandres;Buggenhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Bosteels (AB InBev);Gekocht bij drankencentrale Verhelst in Dendermonde eind 2013 en thuis geproefd op 14-12-2013. Zeer goed, lijkt wat op champagne, het ideale bier om niet-bierdrinkers te overtuigen. Ã©Ã©n van mijn lievelingsbieren. Info en foto's: http://www.beersfrombelgium.eu/nl/Deus_Brut_des_Flanders-b-175.html
Deus Brut des Flandres;Buggenhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Bosteels (AB InBev);Bottle. A birthday gift off Hydes. Drunk at the local byo kebab place. Pale, green tinged gold. No head. Nose has cardboard. Some fusty lemon. Bit of a leathery thing. Weird shit this. Taste has some bready sweetness. Pretty dry. Medium body. Fine, massaging carbonation. Drinks easy at the ABV. Light bitter finish. Weirdly underwhelming.
Deus Brut des Flandres;Buggenhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Bosteels (AB InBev);From a corked bottle. Pours light gold with small head. Aroma of light grain, ginger, pear, apple. Significant carbonation and mouthfeel. Flavors of sparkling apple juice, honey, pear, ginger, love. I've had this brew many times over the last 20 years and this time it really stands out as more than just a champagne type beer, but at the Seattle International Beerfest it was the best beer for me, refreshing, sophisticated, smooth and delicious.
Deus Brut des Flandres;Buggenhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Bosteels (AB InBev);From 0,75l bottle at Sanders place. Yellow golden color, small white head. Smells herbal, elder flowers, nice smell. Full body, soft carbonation. Tastes of elder flowers, flowery, light sweetness, Belgian yeast, grassy. Finishes lightly sweet with notes of elder flower, Belgian yeast and grassy notes. Nice one, good to drink
Deus Brut des Flandres;Buggenhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Bosteels (AB InBev);Helder geel bier met ruime witte schuimkraag. Citrus, bloemig, zoet, met niet te. Blijft lang hangen. Beter dan dame Jeanne
Deus Brut des Flandres;Buggenhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Bosteels (AB InBev);Was tending to some homebrew in my basement and stumbled upon a long-forgotten bottle of Deus I had squÃ¬rreled away, vintage 2005. Was a bit worried, to be honest, that it had gone off after all that time, but the 14 or so years didn't seem to adversely affect the golden elixir whatsoever. Chilled to the recommended 2Â°C and it poured a very fizzy, white head that quickly and completely disappeared in the champagne flute. Pronounced ginger note up front and a bit of mellow Belgian funkiness made for a very enjoyable evening sipper with the better half. Will definitely be looking for another bottle in the near future for comparison's sake (and not waiting 14 years to drink it this time, haha).
Deus Brut des Flandres;Buggenhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Bosteels (AB InBev);Copenhagen 30/3 2019. 75 cl bottle from Meny, Borups AllÃ©, Frb F. Corked with metal keeping everything in place. Brown label made out to look hand drawn with a couple of Hippogriffs. CuvÃ©e Prestige 2017. Pours clear pale yellow with a medium-sized white head. Bubbly. Settles as flimsy thin layer of foam. Patchy and unable to cover the surface of the beer. Resembles a Champagne or Cremant. No Lacing. Aroma is spicy, citric and quite yeasty. Cardamom, ginger, coriander. Acerbic citrus. Hints of banana, humid basement and yeast. Strong carbonation. Wildly prickly, tingling, slightly thick texture. Flavor is medium sweet followed by a slightly stronger citric sour bitterness. Aftertaste is bitter sweet and lingers for a short while. Very Champagne-like and vineous in character. Kind of camouflages the fairly High ABV of 11,5. A bit too heavy on the herbal stuff but well made and an amusing concept.
Deus Brut des Flandres;Buggenhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Bosteels (AB InBev);Aroma: light lemon, touch of stone fruit & hop Appearance: nicely yellow with a touch of haze, big head with patching lacing and lots of fine bubbles Flavour: hit of citrus, floral and stone fruit blended with sweet malt and noticeable spiritous, reminiscent of lemon cello Palate: nicely carbonated, good medium mouthfeel, finishes a touch herbal
Deus Brut des Flandres;Buggenhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Bosteels (AB InBev);"24 February 2019. Wieze Bierfestival - cheers to Meeki, Ama Deke & the lovely Anke! In a suitable champagne glass, pours clear pale golden with a lasting, thin, frothy, off-white head; pleasantly fizzing at the edge. Aroma of apple cider, dried banana, wheat, white grape, white pepper, breadcrust, melon, flowers, perfume. Taste is light fruity sweet, notes of banana, apple, pear, and weirdly, melon, almost cider-like, next to faint honey & bread & perfumey accents; medium spicy bitter middle has white grape, pepper, aniseed, vague grain & yeast. Just a tad wheaty sour before finishing dryish, bit floral hoppy, lingering banana, bread, spices, and warming champagne-like alcohol. Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. Definitely a succesful brew, agreeable too, although I'm glad I got to taste one glass at the festival, not having to buy a whole bottle of it..."

Triple J Stauss & Braun Oatmeal Stout;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;Otis Oatmeal. Pours an espresso color with a light brown head. Nose is milk chocolate, vanilla, meat. Taste is meat smoke, pepper mint, and dark chocolate. Thinner mouthfeel. You give me meat, mint, and chocolate and Iâ€™m happy.
Triple J Stauss & Braun Oatmeal Stout;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;[Tap] This beer is now being sold by Triple Jâ€™s as Otisâ€™ Oatmeal Stout. I was sure to ask the waiter just to make verify that. The beer is an opaque black color with only a slight film of brown head. Aroma of smoky and burnt caramel. Taste is of chocolate and smooth molasses. Creamy mouthfeel, yet still kind of cloying. Definitely one of their more flavorful beers.
Triple J Stauss & Braun Oatmeal Stout;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;This beer can be very different after every vat. Smokey, malty aroma. rich, coffe brown color, absorbs most visability. The head goes from Zeigen Bock-weak to as thick, lasting, and frothy as swiss hot chocolate. Usually, itâ€™s pretty frothy and stays in the glass untl youâ€™re done. Palate is smokey, coffe, and malt and very thick texture. Two of these, while not posessing a high alcohol content, will dehydrate you - presumably from the caffeine and tannic acid and can give you a serious headache after one tall. Itâ€™s weird. I never have more than one before witching to a their pale ale or lager.

Triple J Stauss & Braun Oatmeal Stout;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;Very decent beer, but doesnâ€™t kick you in the face like a stout should. One of my standbys when I go to Hub City however. Sweet flavor, milky texture, not super bitter.
Triple J Stauss & Braun Oatmeal Stout;Lubbock, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triple J Chophouse and Brewery;"I have to say, I was expecting a ""stout"".... what you get is a nice tasting beer, that is pretty smooth, and sweet, but not stout! I will drink it again."

Dupont Blanche Du Hainaut Biologique;Tourpes-Leuze, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie Dupont;Bottle from Drankenhandel Leiden. Aroma is sourish wheat, coriander, spicy yeast, pale malt, dough, light orange peel. Flavour is moderate sweet with a mild wheaty sourness that doesn't work for me. Body is medium. Not a fan.
Dupont Blanche Du Hainaut Biologique;Tourpes-Leuze, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie Dupont;0.25 l bottle from 'Speciaalbierpakket.nl', best before August 2020. Hazy, pale golden with a thin, frothy, almost stable, white head. A little sweetish, floral, spicy and slightly fruity aroma of coriander, orange peel, some banana and a touch of clove. Slightly sweet, moderately bitter, gently yeasty-spicy, moderately floral and a bit fruity taste of clove, banana, hay, wheat and a touch of banana, followed by a short, moderately bitter, rather dry, gently yeasty-spicy finish. Thin to medium body, gently effervescent mouthfeel, lively carbonation. Interesting beer, pretty much a Wit/Saison hybrid, a little too thin for my liking.

Sly Fox Christmas Ale;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Sly Fox Brewing Company;12 oz can, red amber clear. Medium body. Powerful cinnamon aroma, with nutmeg and cloves to a lesser degree. Believe there is some beer snuck in there, but the spice is overwhelming in the taste. Bitter unpleasant finish. Pretty bad.
Sly Fox Christmas Ale;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Very heavy on the spices, cinnamon, clove, etc - Christmasy spices, the ones you'd expect. A bit of bitterness at the beginning, either from hops or excessive spicing, can't tell which. If they laid off the bitterness just a bit, and toned the spices down slightly, this might be very good. It's acceptable as is, but nothing to write home about.

Sly Fox Christmas Ale;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Sly Fox Brewing Company;12 oz. can. Canned early November. Deeper brown appearance with the typical Christmas spice hints. Good amount spice in aroma and flavor. Lots of nutmeg, cinnamon, toffee malt body and clove in the finish. The ginger and clove are really starting to take this beer over. Is it any better real fresh? Not sure, overall a bit heavy in the spice department.
Sly Fox Christmas Ale;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Sly Fox Brewing Company;"Can from Total Wine, Gainesville. Pours clear amber-brown with a small off-white head. Aroma of cinnamon, sugar, nutmeg. Flavor is cinnamon, nutmeg, metal, and little else. It could be spiced iced tea for all I know. Itâ€™s OK, but could be better. Just because you put those ""chirstmas"" spices into a beer doesnâ€™t make it a winter beer."

OCCASION: celebrating another Friday night with Shan and the Tank... APPEARANCE: dense, burnt sienna body that releases little effervescence...the thin white line forms the head, with a smear of an island in the middle... AROMA: the canâ€™s claims are tangible in the aroma--cinnamon and ginger are the most dominant scents; nutmeg and clove are present...the addition of maple syrup to the olfactory is surprising, as are the wet, toasty malts... PALATE: fizzy early and flat at the finish, with a warming, syrupy draw--not the flourish that I hoped for in a Christmas beer, nor is it as full-bodied as it could be... TASTE: nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon definitely evoke the Christmas spirit--even a month after its exit... the syrupy kickback detracts from the overall flavor--it runs akin to cough medicine, with some malt return to add balance--possibly a brown ale base is in here... OVERALL: This beer gets a bit of a boost from the nostalgia spawned from last weekâ€™s Lamb of God/Anthrax concert in Philly...however, the beer on its own does its job but does not demand a second purchase--a reasonable holiday drink that doesnâ€™t distinguish itself...at 5.5%, a favorable drink to combo..."

Odd sour aroma, quite bad. I donâ€™t really get much honey in it. Really quite a cheap, unprofessional feel to it.

Staropramen KvasniÄÃ¡k;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);0.5 l draught @ Vltava, Helsinki as Unfiltered Staropramen. Apperance is golden, very cloudy (like some juice) and big head, which dies very fast, lively and bubbly. Aroma has barley. Taste has barley, bit of sweetness from alcohol, which makes this smooth, but also a bit too heavy for a traditional Czech evening session with beer. Ending has enough hops to make this a balanced experience unless you drink too many of these. Not for those who like hoppier Pilsners.

Staropramen KvasniÄÃ¡k;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Very light beer, no noticeable aroma, a boring beer, pilsner urquell is a better choice for this style of beer
Staropramen KvasniÄÃ¡k;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);I have to assume this is what I had at the shitty little rock bar in kutna hora, labeled Staropramen Nefiltrovany, because whatâ€™s listed here as that name has coriander and wheat and other stuff in it and this certainly did not. Body was deeply cloudy and pale gold with a tall fine-bubbled creamy white head. Nose is extremely pale and neutral with only light touches of pilsner malt and semi-sweet egg white yeast - no discernable hop aromatics, itâ€™s just too muddled. Flavor is pale and quiet wet crackers with sludgy yeast, masking any hop flavor, though their bitterness is present in small amounts. Dense, frothy and rotund body. A strange one, altogether not bad but I greatly prefer the regular Staropramen 12Â°, even if it isnâ€™t a superb bohemian pilsner, itâ€™s at least clean and crisp.

Seabright Banty Rooster IPA;Santa Cruz, California, United States;IPA;Seabright Brewery;Extremely pale color, close to water. No color, no aroma, no flavor, it helped clear my palate for the next beer. Poor excuse for an IPA.

Amber Classic (Pils);BielkÃ³wko, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Browar Amber;Iâ€™m a bit alarmed to see this as a retired beer... with no new ratings in over a year. I just bought mine a week ago at the CT Beverage Mart in Newington, CT. Anyway, I think this beerâ€™s low rating is deserved. It is overly sweet, with very little of the hop bitterness that I expect from a pils. Tastes a bit skunky, like an old Heineken or Beckâ€™s that was left out in the sun. Bleh.
Amber Classic (Pils);BielkÃ³wko, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Browar Amber;Bottled@Kahdet Kasvot, Tampere. Golden colour, small white head. Aroma and flavour are both hayish, grassy, bready malts as well as some slight grainy and rubbery notes.

Amber Classic (Pils);BielkÃ³wko, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Browar Amber;No 306 Rated: 23.01.2008 Can, 500 ml, 11P Appearance: Pours bright shiny, perfectly filtered, golden colur typicall of a Pilsener type beer colour. Head is medium to big in size, frothy, white with decent lacing, slowly decreasing to small, than lasting for quite a long time, carbonation of the body is initially medium , but quickly decreasing to gentle in intensity, 3/5 for a good lacing and well filtered body with a natural gass, again sediment flaoting in the body. Aroma: Very faint and gentle, a bit milky, some hint of chalk and lemon, very simple, not much but positive, denoting quite high standard of lemon lager beer being Pilsener in type. Very mild and gentle floral aroma of hops when the beer gets warmer. Alcohol is not felt being very well hidden. Flavour: Front is grainy and balanced between bitterness and sweetness, than what comes is a distinct grainy taste, flour, malted barley, chalk and a bit accidic - aromatic nose from hops and carbonation. Some notes of lemon and citrus in general. Very good balance between sweetness&bitterness. Finish duration is average. Palate: Body is light, texture is rather wattery, not dry as Bohemian Pilsener, but still well balanced between bitterness and sweetness, carbonation is soft on palate. Finish feel is grainy and chalky.

Remember a good nose Carmel, pine, orange. Nice reddish brown color, always clean. Flavor has the same as the aroma. Very easy drinkin, clean bittersweet finish. I miss this one!
Lucknow IPA;Moultonborough, New Hampshire, United States;IPA;Castle Springs Brewing Co. - Lucknow;I had many pints of this at the Barley Pub in Dover NH. I'll definitely have to look up Trout Brook. As for the beer, it was quite decent, with a strong hoppiness, as a good IPA should have, but it didn't have the over-bitter, sometimes metallic aftertaste that can make an IPA bad. The aroma was fruity and hoppy with a hint of bread.

Bootleg Toms Brown Ale;Margaret River, Australia;Brown Ale;Bootleg Brewery;Bit messy and unpredictable, the Bootleg range. You canâ€™t accuse their beers of being carbon copies of the styles they emulate, but the results are at least interesting. This one was clear brown with a fair head and reeked of coffee beans. Very intense for a 4%abv brown ale. Also in the mix were drinking chocolate powder and some mint. The aroma raised expectations of something full flavoured and robust. Alas no. Milky coffee notes dominated but it went AWOL in the mid-palate and finished abruptly. The carbonation was soft, verging on flat, which seems to be a feature of the bottled range. Drinkable but a bit muddled. (Cozâ€™s Ashfield RB get-together 07. Thanks Coz for this one.)
Bootleg Toms Brown Ale;Margaret River, Australia;Brown Ale;Bootleg Brewery;Bottle. Rusty caramel and some stoutish nutty flavours. KInd of wanted to like it but it just muddled its way to a rather unpleasant finish.
Bootleg Toms Brown Ale;Margaret River, Australia;Brown Ale;Bootleg Brewery;330 ml bottle - Dark reddish brown with a tan head. Thin to medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. Dark roasted malts with a slight nutty/coffee taste, and a faint hint of molasses and charcoal/ash. A low to medium bitterness throughout.
Bootleg Toms Brown Ale;Margaret River, Australia;Brown Ale;Bootleg Brewery;Bottle -- A deep brown brew with a huge tan head and lots of cabonation. Caramel/Chocolate aroma. Watery mouthfeel. Roasted maltiness. Strangely sharp bitter aftertaste. Itâ€™s OK but I probably wonâ€™t buy it again.
Bootleg Toms Brown Ale;Margaret River, Australia;Brown Ale;Bootleg Brewery;Nicely made porter style. Cola-like in appearance but poor head retention. Sweet chocolate nose, feels grainy. Less heavy in the mouth as the chocolate and roast notes are subtle but probably in keeping with the style. In line with most Oz peers but overpriced at $4.

Bootleg Toms Brown Ale;Margaret River, Australia;Brown Ale;Bootleg Brewery;pours with a great white head over the malty brown beer. Beer is quite well balance with a predominance of chocolate grains leadin the initial taste with a slight sour/bitter aftertaste. Is perhaps a little thin, but at the same time is true to itâ€™s aim of emulating the british way of making beer.
Bootleg Toms Brown Ale;Margaret River, Australia;Brown Ale;Bootleg Brewery;Dark crimson with a light brown head. Aroma is sweet and fresh with some chocolate malt. The beer is great up to this stage.. but thats where it ends. The mouthful is thin, and the roasted malts are far too strong in the palate, leaving an aftertaste similar to eating chocolate malt straight out of the sack. The hops are subtle, and bitterness is low. Unimpressive
Bootleg Toms Brown Ale;Margaret River, Australia;Brown Ale;Bootleg Brewery;Maybe my trouble is that I had this from a bottle and not from the keg, but I was very disappointed. I cannot believe that this won any awards based on my tasting experience. Poured very over-carbonated, fizzy with a big head that sunk to nothing quickly. Dark brown and clear, some roasted malt aromas. Sweet palate, but very watery with too much caronation, some nutty chocolate notes, but I had to really search for these traits among the malt. I must have had a bad bottle because nobody else seems to have had a similar experience.
Dogfish Head Snow Blower Belgian Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dogfish Head Brewery;The brewpub brought this one out of retirement in Feb 2015. This time around the beer is 6.5% and brewed with two Belgian yeast strains. Pours a cloudy amber orange with a medium bubbly white head. Aroma of spicy and fruity belgian yeast, sugary notes and some dark fruits. Flavor of spicy/fruity belgian yeast character, citrus, dark fruits and light toasted malt.

Pours a moderate brownish color with a white head that sticks around for a bit with a decent amount of retention. The nose brings forward a moderate amount of sweetness and yeasty esters as well as a light spiciness throughout. The flavor is moderately sweet without too much going on. Thereâ€™s a bit of yeast and fruit, but nothing standing out too much on its own. The mouthfeel is decent enough with moderate carbonation and a good body. Drinkability is pretty decent but thereâ€™s nothing really pulling me back for more. Serving type: growler Reviewed on: 01-20-2011

Pour is murky gold with two fingers of thick White head. Nose is cantaloupe, pears, Belgian yeast, and various spices. Taste is on par, but the fruit is actually a dominant factor. This is a much appreciated turn, especially outside of the world of lambics. Although not my style of choice, this is one tasty brew!"

Dogfish Head Snow Blower Belgian Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dogfish Head Brewery;On tap at the Gaithersburg location on 1/19/07: Pours a transparent copper orange with a wispy-lacing white head. Aroma of lightly sweet crystal malt along with a hint of piny hops. Body starts fairly full and malty with a good flavor hop balance and earthy caramel notes. A good brew, but I didnâ€™t get much Belgian ale character out of it.
Dogfish Head Snow Blower Belgian Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dogfish Head Brewery;Wow. What a huge dissapointment. I expect so much more from DFH and this was just so pedestrian, that it was embarassing, No identifying characterstics what so ever from this one.
Dogfish Head Snow Blower Belgian Ale;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours orange fading to tan with a decent sized head of fairly large bubbles. Very mellow aroma, but interesting cheese notes, some grass, and dark fruits. Taste of light O-fest style malts, white grapes and a light sugar sweetness. Mellow flavor. Thereâ€™s a light spicy finish where the yeast makes itself known (without overdoing it), and a surprising earthy hop bitterness. Fairly light body and a medium to high carbonation. This is a pretty mellow beer, but it certainly doesnâ€™t offend and itâ€™s probably intended to be drank fast and in large quantities.

Bootleg Amber Light;Margaret River, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bootleg Brewery;An amber light is supposed to tell you to slow down before it goes red. At 2.7% you donâ€™t have to at all. Silly really. I guess if you down a thin beer you become what you drink, but you also wouldnâ€™t want to become insipid, unimpressive or tasteless.
Bootleg Amber Light;Margaret River, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bootleg Brewery;bottle, beertopia â€™06. darker than most lights, faint syrup and pride of ringwood with a little detergent and pond scum
Bootleg Amber Light;Margaret River, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bootleg Brewery;A bit hesitant to taste any beer light in alcohol, most Aussie macroâ€™s have stooped to low levels in their quest to brew a full flavoured light beer, but most micro-breweries tend to bring out the best in care when it comes to all their beers and this seemed no exception. Tasted from the bottle after a visit to the brewery and poured into a pilsner glass. Clear deep amber with a short lived bubbly white head that manged a little lace. Sweet caramel and nutty aroma, very subtle, with a little grassy hops. Thin watery palate, light in carbonation and and little length in the swallow. Light malty flavours, nutty and woody, a little sweet and only a hint of bitterness in the back (malt more than hops). Not too bad a light beer and a decent effort from this nice brewery in W.A.â€™s south.

Bootleg Settlers Pale Ale;Margaret River, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bootleg Brewery;Great on the nose, fresh & hoppy and looks slick once you've poured it into the glass. This one lacks the weight on the palate which is a bit of a let down for me.

21st Amendment Holiday Spiced Ale;San Leandro, California, United States;Flavored - Other;21st Amendment Brewery;Welp, this vaults me into the top 5 raters for 21st Amendment, which is a decent honor to have since they are an underrated brewery. Yes, I realize that nobody cares about this in the slightest. No, I donâ€™t care that you donâ€™t care. Yes, I know you donâ€™t care that I donâ€™t care that you donâ€™t care. And so on. Had this on tap at 21st Amendment on New Years Eve. The description is wrong - this beer is not a copper color, itâ€™s dark brown with reddish hues to it. A small off-white head sits on top but fades pretty quickly. Aroma is heavily spiced with some caramel and roast. Flavor is lots of winter spices (cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg), caramel, roasted malt, and molasses. Medium body and just a little booze in there, but not more than youâ€™d expect for an 8% beer (which is how it was listed on the menu, although RB has it at 7%). Overall an above-average holiday beer.

This was being called the ""BÃ¤ren MÃ¤rzen"" when I had it, but the bartender said it was essentially the same recipe as the Oktoberfest. Amber/copper in color with a white head. Extreme sweetness. Lots of berry flavors (blueberry and raspberry) from all the hops present here. Seems super strong at 6.5% ABV. Aroma is candy sweet. Mild carbonation, medium body, poor lacing.

Steelhead Hairy Weasel Hefe;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Steelhead Brewing Co.;A: The pour is a turbid/hazy pale golden color with a fingerâ€™s worth of white head. Served with a slice of lemon, unfortunately. S: The nose, surprisingly, starts off with clove and banana notes. Thereâ€™s a definite wheat character, too, almost a raw wheat thing going on. Not a very good nose, but not horrendous. T: This is probably too bitter for a hefeweizen, but itâ€™s not overwhelming. Thereâ€™s a decent clove flavor, but not really any banana, and not really too sweet. Lightly tart at points and a definite straw flavor on the finish. M: The body is medium and so is the carbonation. D: I guess Iâ€™ve had worse brewpub hefeweizens, but this wasnâ€™t all that great either.

Steelhead McFaddins Oatmeal Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Very nicely done, but seriously, how could this one have gone wrong at all?
Steelhead McFaddins Oatmeal Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Draught pint at Redbones on 12/5/06 Unfortunately, the tan-beige colored head immediately fizzles to nothing, leaving a rather still-looking glass of opaque or near-opaque black liquid. Iâ€™ll chalk it up to pressurization at the bar or the glass (though this is almost never the case at Redbones), as this beer was anything but problematic and I see no point in taking off points from an otherwise wonderful beer. Furthermore, I see plenty of scores showing quite the opposite experience of mine. Sticky, vanilla flavored marshmallows rise up sweetly, dotted with sweet dates, light black cherries and the most subtle, yet noticeable, roastiness. Vinousness, bordering on liqueur-like flavors with anise and maybe some cocoa? Rich, unrelenting aroma (though it must be sniffed close to the glass). No off-flavors and quite the rollercoaster of sweet and dry flavors. Fruity and sweet at times, to spicy and roasty with a broad range of complexities. The flavor takes the aroma and personifies it tenfold. Especially upon warming, itâ€™s just a wealth of rich flavors in the mouth. But as all good beers, itâ€™s balanced as well. Lightly dry char and roast notes balance the sweet choco-caramel and vanilla notes. Dark fruits are perky on the edges and the body is soft, with a sticky, and at times, velvet-like texture. A very lovely anise note is well-placed and balances some fudginess. Coffee flavors are light and stay mostly out of the way, just adding a light complexity. The flavor is so strong and full, it coats the palate and lingers long, with no loose sections. Even undercarbonated, it hardly comes off loose, the malt just adding so much depth and texture. Chocolate-cherry-cola finish with balancing roastiness is phenomenal.
Steelhead McFaddins Oatmeal Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Dark brown, rootbeer-like coloring with a roasted beige head. Some red glint is noticable in the light as well. Roasted malts sport a very caramely aroma. I actually smell the oats as well. Creamy texture and tons of roasted coffee crowds the tongue. Iâ€™m also picking up a smidgen of dark fruit as well - maybe prune. Long finish with a black cherry smack and mild oakiness.
Steelhead McFaddins Oatmeal Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Steelhead Brewing Co.;A pretty dark brown pour, and it was dark and cloudy today, so I could not really see any other hints of anything coming through. The aroma was strongly medicinal and very roasty, to me there was nothing sweet about this stout. It seemed to me like the balance was off in the nitro,or the carbonation almost had a gassy, medicinal roastiness. The flavor has lots of chocolate and coffee, but there was just something off here, and I had to pass on ordering a full pint.
Steelhead McFaddins Oatmeal Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Steelhead Brewing Co.;(GABF05) Clear red-black body with tan head. Aroma is medium sweet, rich, cocoa, light roast, faint cherry. Taste is moderately sweet, milk chocolate, some caramel, roast. Light-medium body.

Steelhead McFaddins Oatmeal Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Pours a very dark brown, almost but not quite black with a nice tan head. Aroma was filled with chocolate and coffee tones. Taste was sweet at first then ended a bit bitter when the hops kicked in. Chocolate and coffee tastes really made this sweet stout, and the oatmeal made it nice and creamy.
Steelhead McFaddins Oatmeal Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Huge rich roasted oatmeal aorma that's just incredable. Everlasting light brown head throughout. I hear the Lord Stanley Stout won Gold at GABF in '02, this isn't it. This is just awesome. The rich flavor just emvelops your mind and soul with fantastic coffee and a dark delectable dry sweetness. I would put this against any of the very good one's.

Clear pale copper red in colour with a thin white head. Hint of sweet shortbread biscuit in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt delivers a sweet pomegranate fruit flavour which is long in intensity. Slight prickle of hop resins give a dry aftertaste. Finish is rather short with malt just edging it. An ok session bitter but not my favourite from the portfolio.

Hampshire Arthur Pendragon;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hampshire Brewery;Oops. Nearly entered this into the database under its full title (Arthur Pendragon S.A). Budget bottle from Sainsburyâ€™s. Weâ€™ve got a real gusher on our hands here. Well, an oozer anyway. Beige worm of froth wriggling from the bottle a good 10 minutes after most if it had been (very carefully) decanted. Froths insanely without provocation. At least you know theyâ€™ve stuck some yeast in there. Impressive from a BCA seeing as so many of them are stone dead and pour like cordial. Apple strudel yeastiness, earthy jammy hop (with a musty squeeze of green), and enticing caramel aroma really makes me want to tuck right in. Earthy chocolate apple hop flavour sprinkled with ash. Yep, loads of pretty standard BC acidity, earthy applepeel and yeasty sparkle, but it didnâ€™t detract from my enjoyment of the beer. Clean but dirty. Well conditioned but badly behaved. Naughty one.
Hampshire Arthur Pendragon;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hampshire Brewery;Bottle from Sainsbury. Deep amber, rocky off white head. Nice yeast, decent ESB. Itâ€™s got a bit of that earthy BCA quality to it. Yeast character is good. Fruit berry is good. But the BCA earthiness ruins it for me.
Hampshire Arthur Pendragon;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hampshire Brewery;Bottle from Sainsburyâ€™s Cannock. Big head upon pouring with a very definite and unusual flavour. Full bodied and quite bitter with som hops present. a malt finnish makes for a very interesting bitter.Unusual, quite complex and interesting.

Hampshire Arthur Pendragon;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hampshire Brewery;Bottle from Sainsburys. Deep amber with a decent beige head.

Hampshire 1066;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Hampshire Brewery;Bottle from BeersOfEurope. A pleasant and drinkable beer. Doesnâ€™t stand out in any way, but does a reasonable enough job. Thereâ€™s some mild hops undercutting the pale malt. It hangs together well enough. A lasting nibble in the finish. The strength isnâ€™t felt in the drinking, but makes itself known in the effects. A decent, soft, mildly buttery and well behaved beer.
Hampshire 1066;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Hampshire Brewery;Yellow with the haziiness that lots of bottle conditioned beers seem to have. Poured with no head and surprisingly little body considering its strength. Not very exciting.
Hampshire 1066;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Hampshire Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), Ealing Beer Festival, May 2006. Pale gold colour. Bags of resinous hops in the aroma. Sweet fruit comes through on the palate, with a decent citric hop rush. Also some slightly green apple/pear that makes for a sharp, but smooth mouthfeel, enhanced by a subtle biscuity malt backdrop. Crisp and refreshing finish with a distinctly bittersweet character. Thereâ€™s some warming alcohol evident, but no burn. The cask Hampshire beers seem noticeably better than the bottled. I like this one.
Hampshire 1066;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Hampshire Brewery;Bottle conditioned. Golden colour with a thick white head. Fruity and spicey aroma. Flavours are hoppy, fruity and sour. A bit too sour, itâ€™s distracting. Firm bodied. I almost like it.

Trap Rock Ghost Pony Helles Lager;Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Trap Rock Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Even light than the wit, which is odd. It also has a bit too much of a grassy aspect, and then drinks with a slick, buttery popcorn-ish thing. Almost nothing to it. (#8523, 10/11/2014)
Trap Rock Ghost Pony Helles Lager;Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Trap Rock Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was on tap and served in a pint glass. The appearance had a hazy light colored brown. The smell had some bready/caramel malts in a roasty sort of way. The taste was somewhat sweet and had a long sweet aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a decent sessionable aspect about it. Overall, this was a good Munich Helles Lager worthy of having again.

Trap Rock Ghost Pony Helles Lager;Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Trap Rock Brewery;Location: Draft at the Brewpub, 10/5/12 Aroma: This beer has a nose of light grass, some malts, and some yeast Appearance: This one pours a clear almost watery, white wine looking type of color Flavor: The flavor has a clean, light sweetness and some light hops as well for a good balanced flavor Palate: The body is pretty light, it has a smooth feel on the mouth, and average carbonation Overall Impression: I canâ€™t imagine ever really craving this, or wanting to order one again with so many more interesting offerings on the menu, but I thought this was a pretty solid light ale.
Trap Rock Kestrels Joy IPA;Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Trap Rock Brewery;Location: Draft at the Brewpub, 10/5/12 Aroma: The aroma has some resin, some citrus, and a little soap Appearance: It pours a clear light orange color, with a white head, and medium lace Flavor: The taste is mild sweet, with a resiny bitterness, and underlying dish soap flavor Palate: The body is light-medium, it feels a touch sticky, and has a lengthy dry finish Overall Impression: This one definitely could have been much better but the dish soap really kills the flavor for me. Still, it is close, and I bet if it wasnâ€™t for that dish soap it would have been great. Itâ€™s a shame because the IPA I sampled that is coming on next is really good, and this one just isnâ€™t quite up-to-par.

Berkshire Cabin Fever Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Berkshire Brewing Company;"Poured into an English pint glass, the appearance was a ruddy burnt orange to brown color with a solid sustaining fingerâ€™s worth of off white foamy head. The head must last for a good minute before gently dissipating and creating some light speckled lace. The aroma starts off with some sweet to spicy estery fruit flowing upon rich caramel and toffee malts. Some grassy notes. Clean earthy and spicy hops beat feet upon those malts to add a little bit of zing. Sly herbal notes underneath and then a little bit of chocolate. The flavor balances very nicely between the sweet to spicy to fruity and caramel/toffee blended flow all combining extremely nice and right on into the aftertaste and on into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionable flow smoothing out on my tongue. The use of the malts in this beer really helped smooth out some of that ""zing"" I smelled in the aroma as it doesnâ€™t let in any cloying features but just really feels absolutely wonderful. Overall, an English pale ale with a little beef. Feels just a tad heavier than some others of itâ€™s style, perhaps the chocolate in it, but if anything for a medium ABV-ed beer, itâ€™s heartier than expected and definitely could still go with some fish nâ€™chips."

T: To my surprise, there actually was a flavor to the beer! Though it mostly consists of sweet malts, there is a touch of bitterness and perhaps some floral hops. M: As you might expect, the body is light and the carbonation is plentiful. But, itâ€™s somewhat necessary for this beer. D: One of those beers thatâ€™s made for the Bud Light crowd. I can see how this is a choice for some, but Iâ€™d prefer a beer with a bit more going on.

Nav-A-Gator Peace River Pilsner;Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Florida Beer Company;"Yet another largely forgettable ""specialty beer"" contracted brewed for a restaurant by a so-so brewery. Served so cold that it had ice chunks floating in it. I''d say it negatively impacted the flavor but once I let it warm up it still didn''t have much flavor. Bit sweet with a mild hop finish, but far too many rice tones in its thinness. A few malts, but in general just another boring pilsner. That being said, if you get to the Nav-A-Gator just north of Punta Gorda, I highly, highly recommend the grouper sandwich, blackened. More than makes up for this forgettable brew."

S: There is a fair bit of nuttiness and perhaps a bit of chocolate to the nose. There are some toasty malts and caramel sweetness as well. T: The nuttiness and chocolate flavors are present as you might expect. Unfortunately, there is an almost chalky bitterness (aspirin?) to the beer that really ruins it. M: The body is a bit on the light side with the aforementioned chalkiness and a moderate carbonation. D: Not one of the better offerings from Callahanâ€™s. There are certainly better brown ales available, so I would suggest going with something else.

M: Medium in body, but perhaps a touch watered down. The carbonation also isnâ€™t as aggressive as I usually like in a pale ale. D: For what it is, not a bad beer. I would have liked the hoppiness to translate to the flavor a bit better, but a decent enough pale ale.

Callahan's Mesa Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Callahan's Pub & Brewery;Draft at brewery. Decent amber color with an OK head. Fruity citrusy hops. Some bright fruit too. Flavors came off a bit more bitter than the sweet aroma, but overall, not too bad.
Callahan's Mesa Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Callahan's Pub & Brewery;On tap@Callahans: Golden amber color with a small (bar pour) white head. Aroma is light and sweet with a hint of hops. Flavor starts malty fading to a light citrus hop finish. A fairly decent pale ale. One of Callahans better house brews.
Callahan's India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Callahan's Pub & Brewery;Draft at brewpub before my first QUAFF meeting. Woohoo! Amber color. Nice small bubble head. Middle of road sweetness. Very nicely done grapefruit hop bitterness. I think this beer is underrated, for whatever reason. Even I dropped it 0.1-0.2 to fit closer to the current ratings.
Callahan's India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Callahan's Pub & Brewery;Draught at the brewpub: Bronze, nose of light cascades and sour malt. The flavor is similar with tart, off-kilter malts. Not good at all. Husky, sour, blech.
Callahan's India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Callahan's Pub & Brewery;Pours amber in color with a little white head. Little bit of caramel malt and lighter on both hop aroma and flavor than expected. Not enough body, and needs more (some) dry hops.
Callahan's India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Callahan's Pub & Brewery;Draft. Deep amber with a white head that lasted pretty long. Nice lacing for the whole glass. Aromas were a little weak, some floral and some citrus. Flavors were better, normal IPA flavors. Pretty good beer.
Callahan's India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Callahan's Pub & Brewery;Took out a jug from the pub: Deep amber color with a small white head. Light sweet nose. Flavor is caramel candy sweet (maybe a tad too sweet) fading to a light hop bitterness and finishing with a tart grapefruit after taste.
Callahan's India Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;Callahan's Pub & Brewery;Had on tap at Callahan's on March 12, 2003 After trying a few of the other beers on tap, I figured I'd try the one I'd probably like the most, the IPA. Probably the best locally brewed beer on tap, the IPA has a nice hoppiness with a good balance of malt. The beer is a dark brown color with a fair sized head, but what surprised me (and those around me) was the amount of lacing. As I drank, there were rings on down the beer from previous IPA levels - it looked quite beautiful actually when I was done. If you're going to go with a house beer (nice and cheap both during and after happy hour), the IPA is the way to go.

Kesselring Premium Pils;Marktsteft, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Kesselring;Bottle from the brewery. Clear gold with a billowy large-bubbled head. Stale malt impression is white bread and saltine cracker with muted lemon hop aromatics and off-notes of dryer sheets and chalk. Light, body, fizzy, astringent, husky and minerallic. No sugar to help push against the high effervescence, so it comes across drier and more bitter than it should. A shame that the bottles doesnâ€™t fare well, we had a zwickel pull of the pilsner directly from the tank and it was in better shape, still didnâ€™t have a great malt character but at least it was bright.

Kesselring Schlemmer WeiÃŸbier;Marktsteft, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Privatbrauerei Kesselring;Bottle from the brewery. Lightly hazed gold with a medium-sized white head. Impression of the nose is stale banana slices, muted clove esters, yeast with a quier salt and pepper effect. Light bodied and effervescent. Dry, pasty, starchy, tart and turning sour with a rough dose of yeast in the finish. Off balance and unpalatable.

Kesselring Schlemmer WeiÃŸbier;Marktsteft, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Privatbrauerei Kesselring;Draft. Pour was hazy straw colored. Weak lacing. Aroma of fruity banana esters, some doughy elements, spicey phenolic notes low. Flavor followed, grass mixed in there, but again notably lacking phenolic kick that I like balancing out these hefes. I could see why this bombs out in bottles, but from the tap it was decent.
Kesselring Schlemmer WeiÃŸbier;Marktsteft, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Privatbrauerei Kesselring;Catch up rating from notes, 2012: Bottle from Bierwelt. Poured into weizen glass, golden, hazy, weak head, haziness increases as bottom of bottle is poured in. Aroma is bready, but the normal weizen scent is rather subdued, other citrus notes. Taste comes in kind of weak as well. Kind of disappointing.

Kesselring Schlemmer WeiÃŸbier;Marktsteft, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Privatbrauerei Kesselring;Bottle. Hazy yellow color with a disappearing foamy white head. Aroma of banana and lemon. Thereâ€™s something wrong with the taste. Itâ€™s quite harsh and tang. I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s because of the date (2 weeks past BB) or does it normally taste like this.

Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Scottish Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Scottish Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Drank from the taps at the brewery. Pours a hazy amber color. Aroma is of malts and sugar. Taste has a nice fruity maltiness to it. Aftertaste leaves a little bit of roasted nuttiness, clean finish.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Scottish Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Scottish Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Orangish-brown in color with little off-white head. Big malty aroma with a bit of nuttiness and alcohol in there. Flavor is more of the same with a sweet creamy mouthfeel that makes this an easy ale to drink. Finish is a little sour and earthy with just a touch of alcohol warming. A pleasant take on a scotch ale.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Scottish Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Scottish Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Thanks to Ryan for sharing this at HWOH. Again- this one is 8.5%, not 6%. Pours a deep amber with ruby highlights and a thin head. Aroma is sweet with lots of caramel malts, and hints of burnt wood or peat. Flavor is a bit astringent but sweet upfront and malty. Kind of sour in the end actually- and finished dry and woody.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Scottish Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Scottish Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Pours rich amber color with tan head that vanishes in a flash. Aroma is of wet dog ( or dog bathed in wort). Flavor is malty with rich earthy notes. Not bad for one bottle, would not invest in a six pack.

Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Scottish Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Scottish Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Roasty and chocolately, This might be the best Cottonwood Brew Iâ€™ve had. Maybe the Scottish Aleâ€™s just hit me in the right spot. This is very very good. Nice malt and hop mix. Great flavor and a smooth drinking beer. Another great Beer courtesy of North Carolinaâ€™s finest, Ross. Traded twice with Ross, #3 Iâ€™m sure wonâ€™t be that far away in the future. I really liked this. I think you will too.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Scottish Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Scottish Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Like Beer God, I also had this at the Bier Garten in Portsmouth. Ruddy brown color with nearly non-existant head. Aromas of brown sugar and general sweetness, not complex. Flavor is completely one dimensional - general brown sugar sweetness. Body/mouthfeel is insepid, would be considered thin even for a pale ale, and is totally disappointing. Lingering butterscotch aftertast refused to go away. I found this beer utterly lacking in every quality except appearance.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Scottish Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Scottish Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Had this at the Bier Garden in Portsmouth VA on 8-7-04. Reddish brown body with almost no head. Nose is malty and sweet with hints of caramel and brown sugar. Taste is, again, malty and sweet with some hints of chocolate coming out. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style but it is pleasant enough to be enjoyable. Not as rich as Iâ€™d hoped for, though. Finish is also sweet but thereâ€™s a weird paper-ish taste coming out in it.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Scottish Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Scottish Ale;Carolina Beer Company;dark red color with a head that goes away very quickly. smell is very malty and has a slight hint of chocolate. taste is also very malty, not much hop presence in this one. a very nice scottish ale, but this class is really not something i go for, because i am more of a hop guy than a malty guy. nice brew though.
Vermont Pub 80 Shilling Scottish Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Poured into a pint glass at the brewpub, the appearance was a brown clear color, sly transparency, and a quickly dissipating head. No lace. The aroma had a fair amount of nutty malts, almost almond character. Sly earthiness, some wood. The flavor was basically the same with a sly woody to nutty sweet balanced aftertaste leading into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a super nice sessionably smooth feel rolling about it. Low carbonation. Overall, nice Scottish ale. Could have again with a bacon cheeseburger nicely.
Vermont Pub 80 Shilling Scottish Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Decent, if uninspired, low-gravity Scotch Ale.

Jolly Pilsener;Neihu, Taipei, Taiwan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Jolly Brewery and Restaurant (Great Reliance);On draught at the Heng Yang road restaurant, Ximending, Taipei, Taiwan. Another wonderfully crafted beer from this brewer. Produces up a shimmering straw yellow with fine carbonation lifting up a silky, rocky cloud of white that holds and laces well. Nose hints at lemongrass, mint, elderflower and dusty palest malts. Hoppy, well actually itâ€™s as bitter as the gates of hell, but in that pleasant, all smiles way. Delicate, light bodied and racy across the tongue. Spicy, minty and earthy with a fragrant pot pourri perfume late. Light lemon and honey tea blend minces mid-palate whilst a good level of malt grounds it all giving great balance. This is a wonderful quaffer and one of the best Pilseners I have tried. I loved it so much it became the mainstay of the rest of the trip. Delicious draught lager!
Jolly Pilsener;Neihu, Taipei, Taiwan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Jolly Brewery and Restaurant (Great Reliance);Tap @ Jolly BrewPub Restaurant. Clear golden yellow, reasonable head. Vanilla corn grain aroma. Sweet barley sugar flavour with hints of vegetables. Sharp on palate. Good big flavoured pilsener.
Jolly Pilsener;Neihu, Taipei, Taiwan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Jolly Brewery and Restaurant (Great Reliance);This has more in common w/ an American blond or craft brew lager than a traditional pils but that works OK for me. It is clear and yellow w/ a mix of foamy bubbles for a head. Itâ€™s mild and a bit grainy w/ some fruity American hops (menu mentions Liberty). It has crisp carbonation and is medium bodied w/ some grassy, herbal bitterness in the finish. This is a tasty and easy drinking brew even if it is not quite to the reported style.
Jolly Pilsener;Neihu, Taipei, Taiwan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Jolly Brewery and Restaurant (Great Reliance);On tap at the brewpub restaurant in Taipei. Hazy golden colour. Hints of banana and clove, good bitterness. Quite a good pilsener with some weizen character.
Jolly Pilsener;Neihu, Taipei, Taiwan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Jolly Brewery and Restaurant (Great Reliance);Clean and smooth pilsener with some complexity to the flavor. Not overly carbonated. Iâ€™m not a pilsener fan, but I did enjoy this beer. Hoppy and slightly bitter.

Jolly Weizen;Neihu, Taipei, Taiwan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jolly Brewery and Restaurant (Great Reliance);This was my first from a sampler at the brewpub-like location (no brew on premise allowed in Taiwan or so I understand) and I was surprised to get such a nice hefeweizen. It is cloudy orange w/ a creamy head of fine bubbles. Its nose is banana up front w/ some spicy clove to pin it down. Itâ€™s creamy but not sweet w/ vigorous carbonation that softens its juicy texture with just a touch of earthy bitterness in the finish. This is pretty down-the-middle for the style and very well done.

Jolly Weizen;Neihu, Taipei, Taiwan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jolly Brewery and Restaurant (Great Reliance);"This turned out to be a pretty good wheat beer. The wheat flavor was there, but not too sweet like some weizens. Good color and ""cloudiness"", too."
Jolly Weizen;Neihu, Taipei, Taiwan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jolly Brewery and Restaurant (Great Reliance);Tap. Golden color, pretty clear. Very light wheat aroma that falls apart into a sea of uncoordinated malts and wet cardboard. I was not impressed. Yeah, so I went to the bathroom while drinking this stuff and saw something that looked like a guy in a tux and a girl in a dress on the doors. I took the tux and on the way out was this Asian chick...well, I thought it was a chick, with the feminine face and crazy hair. I doubled back to look at the other door and then realized that I had it right. I must have really insulted the guy, but he really needed to do something about the hair.
Jolly Weizen;Neihu, Taipei, Taiwan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Jolly Brewery and Restaurant (Great Reliance);Sampled draught at Jolly, Neihu, Taipei, Taiwan. Golden coloured and slightly hazy. Phenolic, fruity, slightly ashy and just a tad estery, this wheat beer is more clean and less lively than the average weizen. It is medium bodied with low bitterness. Probably a sensibly understated wheat beer to be able to find a way into a beer market that not is very adventurous.

Hepworth Christmas Ale;Pulborough, West Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;Hepworth Brewery;500 bottle from Cask & Glass, Tonbridge. I saw the previous yearâ€™s offering in the clear glass 660 bottle that Chris_o had in an off licence in Brighton and wished I bought it, so when I saw this I had to buy it. Reddish copper colour with lasting off white head. It does smell of christmas cake, malty with dried fruits. alcohol and hops (ok hops arenâ€™t in christmas cake), Full in mouth, alcohol kick comes through in the end. Lots of tea and tobacco, more dried/burnt fruit too. I love it. More dry malt and dry peppery hop on finish. The hops, the malt, the alcohol all go to make this one of the best UK beers Iâ€™ve had. It is extraordinary. It really does assault the senses.
Hepworth Christmas Ale;Pulborough, West Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;Hepworth Brewery;660 ml bottle. 2005 vintage. In England we usually expect Christmas ales to be dark and rich, so the relatively pale orange/ginger colour (and the clear glass bottle) didnâ€™t look particularly promising. The contents, however, were a pleasant surprise. Poured with no head to speak of and a slight haze (bottle conditioned). Big estery, fruity aroma - bags of orange and tropical fruit - with some yeasty notes. Smooth and spicy on the palate. Lots of sharp, juicy Seville oranges and marmalade. Some late bitterness although the overall mouthfeel is mellow. The alcohol is not too intrusive. A tasty, light but full-flavoured Christmas beer.

Sterkens Kriek;Meer, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Sterkens;Deep brown, cloudy appearance, thick as natural apple juice, heady fermented fruit aroma, sediment at the bottom, full-rounded flavor.
Sterkens Kriek;Meer, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Sterkens;Ha, drunken Paul cracked this baby on Friday night of BCTC (7/20/07). Early Friday night was about the only time I was somewhat sober, so Iâ€™m not going to miss out on rating this one. Old bottle, not sure how old, but Iâ€™d guess it was at least 5 years old, if not more. Still poured a one-finger pink-tinged-white head atop a mostly clear (protein chunk in bottom) marmalade colored beer. Head faded fairly rapidly to ring, leaving little lacing. Medicinal phenols and band-aids in the nose are bolstered by vanilla-like oxidation of the malts and hints of cherry pit or cherry juice notes. Light black pepper, some waxiness and a bit of artificial sweetner. Still quite a strong aroma, with nips of fusel alcohol on the finish. An odd citric acidity is still present, assumedly from the cherries. Little/no acetic acid, with lightly oxidized, but still rather enjoyable pale malts producing honey and vanilla. Some brief instances of caramel with a tangy, almost lactic or citrus-rind-like finish. Carbonation is still ample, though not exactly tight or creamy. Not bad though, considering the age.
Sterkens Kriek;Meer, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Sterkens;Bottle: Poured a deep and murky orange/amber with a small diminishing white head. Lots of sour/tart cherries in the nose. Flavor was the same, stayed and finished tart, no syrupy qualities at all, smoothed over by mellower malt. Nicely carbonated mouthfeel.
Sterkens Kriek;Meer, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Sterkens;33 cl bottle. Very cloudy amber brown with a nice head that settled quickly. Aromas of tart cherry, chocolate and alcohol. Taste is nice and sour with some Very crisp and refreshing.
Sterkens Kriek;Meer, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Sterkens;My bottle stated that the contents were a Belgian Golden Ale. My guess is that it's a tripel. Definitely not a cherry fermented lambic... Lightly hazy golden brew. Small, swirling white head. The nose is very fruity and spicey. Yeasty. Yellow apple and pear. Flavors of white fruit and orange blossom honey. Medium-bodied with a thin, watery mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Astringent and lightly sweet finish. For around $10 per bottle (nice looking bottle), what a waste of cash. Overpriced, but not unpleasant in the least.
Sterkens Kriek;Meer, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Sterkens;This beer poured a golden color and formed a nice foamy white head that acted a lot like a float and left circular lace as it slowly subsided. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and citrus. A taste of malt and caramel which gives it a bit of sweetness in the fairly astrigent finish.
Sterkens Kriek;Meer, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Sterkens;An adequate kriekbier. Fairly tart and sourish, as it should be. Another quality product from Sterkens.

Crystal-amber appearance. Thick malt profile. Crisp peach aroma and peach/nectarine also prominent in the flavor. I liked this better than the real Fat Tire.

Back Road Ale;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale;Back Road Brewery;Bottle from Tim. Poured into a nonic pint glass, the appearance was a murky dark orange color with a cap of a little white foamy head that fell off at a mild pace. Some messy lace. The aroma had some caramel/toffee malts up front, then biscuits and bread and then ended with a little bit of orange extract sweetness. The flavor was sweet all of the way through riding on the blend of the orange and the malts. Did I enjoy it? Hmmmm....well, its just super sweet which also lead into the aftertaste and finish. The palate was almost medium bodied, seemed to sit just a touch under with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt fine. Overall, is this really supposed to be an American pale ale or an English one? I mean, well, I didnt mind this one so much for me, but honestly, arent the American ones supposed to have more hops to them. I thought this was an English pale ale.

Lighter bodied, soft, with a cleansing tart and drying bitter finish. An ok brew, light on aromatics and somewhat odd flavor-wise, but the palate saves it. No idea on the age of the bottle. Iâ€™ll have to get over to LaPorte some time and check this place out.

SLO Sapp Head Imperial Stout;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;SLO Brew;(Nitro Draft: 2004 Strong Ale Festival, Pizza Port in Carlsbad, CA. Day 1, Beer 7) The flavor is very sweet, perhaps too sweet, dark roasted, moderate coffee, and fairly bitter. Moderate alcohol presence. Medium body for an Imperial Stout, but still fairly full mouthfeel. The sweetness sticks on the palate for ages. Dark roasted, coffee nose with a fairly sweet aroma in the background. Nearly jet black in color. Pours a good size tan head after the cascading ceases, and retains that level fairly well. Leaves fairly dense lacing, not bad for well used festival glass.

Medium orange color, slightly cloudy. Large sized white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Mostly apricots and peaches. Medium bodied Belgian Strong Ale. Malts are fruity and sweet. Nice bright yeasts. Very sweet. Lots of fruit esters. Lots of banana and clove flavors. Nice and smooth. Might have been a little young yet, sort of a chaotic mix of ester, carbonation and yeasts. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Rock Bottom San Diego Johnny Rebels Earthquake Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Rock Bottom San Diego;This beer was had on tap at the San Diego Strong Ale Festival 2004. This beer pours a cloudy dark orange color iwth hints of yellows and reds as well and a thin white head which quickly dissipated and left little head. Swirling led to pretty much slight lacing, but nothing all that interesting. The aroma is belgiany with spices, yeasts and lemons being predominant. It was pretty damn cold by now as this was my last sample of the night and it was only 48F out, so warming the beer was very difficult. As it warmed some cloves and lemon yeast became very apparent as it twirled to a tart and fruity finish. Some oranges, apricot, orange peel and lemon in the finish. Not much presence of alcohol, but if you looked closely enough it was there. Full of carbonation here..almost too much so. Would someone PLEASE put this beer away for a while and let it age. This beer needs to calm down a WHOLE bunch, but its got the makings of a nice solid Belgian Strong Ale.

Brilliantly dank, vinous aroma that reaches to the heart of delicious, farmerâ€™s market freshness; notes of pine, mint leaves, orange rind, and tropical fruit. Kiwi and citrus. Crisp and fruity taste, pure with sparkling newness like a morning dew; grassy and lavender floral tones play prominently, with understated candy sweetness balancing underneath.

Willimantic E-Mail IPA (2002 - 2014);Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Yet another IPA from Willimantic and one of the better ones Iâ€™ve tried. Pours amber with a thin white head. Smells of citrus and perfumy with some wintery splashes. Tastes of pine resin with some nice even bitterness as the beer warms.

Aroma of citrus, garlicky hops, nacho cheese Doritoes. Reminds me of Smuttynose IPA. Flavor of rich caramel and bready malts, garlicky, spicy hops.

Willimantic Address Unknown IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub and a later growler as well. Mmm, mmm, now weâ€™re talking. Very, very cloudy deep orange coloured beer. Bright sweet hop aroma. Lots of bright orange/grapefruit peel and a little bit of apricot fruitiness as well. Quite sweet with a low of resinousness. Fruity and tropical with the malts just peeking out from behind. Papaya and mango and a rich creamy body that somehow manages to stay lean and balanced. There is a touch of zesty/herbal quality on the back that really sets off the fruity notes that are up front. No complaints from this hophead!
Willimantic Address Unknown IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Thanks to JoeMcPhee for sharing - lightly hazy copper, with a soapy lace - explosive, tangy grapefruit hoppiness in the nose - a lot of pine and herbs - earthy hop character - more of the same in the flavor - not much to say except it is nicely balanced between malt and potent hops - itâ€™s got the ineffable greatness that more awesome ipas have, so I will not even attempt to explain how good it is.
Willimantic Address Unknown IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Growler supplied by kmweaver. Poured a hazed orange color with a small off-white head. The aroma was great with fresh hop forward notes. Citrus and sweaty hop aromas with a sweet malt base that pokes out just enough to give balance. Nice citrus hop flavor with hints of pine. Long mild-moderate bitterness on the finish. Medium bodied.
Willimantic Address Unknown IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;"Draft @ Willi. Pours a murky, pulpy, bright orange-amber color; thin off-white head with patchy lacing. Juicy, resiny passion fruit and orange hoppiness in the aroma; very soft edges, but an enormous amount of chewy, fresh hops in the nose: some red fruits and caramel underneath. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: amazingly dense, pulpy, hop-forward character (oranges, tropical fruits); nice levels of carbonation; zesty, tongue-numbing bitterness; very generous hop character, and ridiculously tasty and dense and hoppy for under 7% (listed as 6.8% on the main board). This tastes like a much much larger beer, but without the slightest show of alcoho; complex red fruits and soft sugar lurking underneath. Hugely successful and impressive. Lengthy finish: some lingering tongue-numbing orange and tropical hops, breadiness, and well-toasted malts."

Willimantic Address Unknown IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Dark amber with a white head. Fresh, green hop nose, pine and citrus, lots of hop action. Some bready, biscuity notes creep in after you grow accustomed to the hop assault. Rather dry. Tastes just like it smells - a numbingly bitter hop concert. Nice!

Ojai Makis Russian Imperial Stout;Ojai, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Ojai Brew Pub;bland coffee flavor. no head. dark boddy. fairly smooth body. all in all i found this beer to be a little boring.
Ojai Makis Russian Imperial Stout;Ojai, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Ojai Brew Pub;Probably the most disappointing imperial stout i have had to date. Good thick coffee aroma, and a pour of a dark brown with absolutely no head. When held up to the light it almost glowed a ruby red it seemed...anyhow, the taste was practically of pure chocolate and boy was it dry. The taste was very bland though, almost thin and weak for a russian imperial. It finished with a mocha-like aftertaste but it just didnt combine a solid taste with the aroma i was getting off of it. The taste was far too thin for the palate, and the dryness did not balance well at all.
Ojai Makis Russian Imperial Stout;Ojai, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Ojai Brew Pub;<b>12/06/02: Had on tap at Pizza Port Strong Ale Festival</b><br>After the first few stouts I ever tasted, I really wasn''t overly fond of them. Thanks to recent findings (including this beer and Alesmith''s Speedway Stout), stouts have progressed up my list of favorites. This offering is pourted with a light black appearance very little, if any head. A strong coffee aroma eminates from this stout and it goes down quite easily. A sweet, light aftertaste finishes this fine stout. A superb offering by the Ojai Brewing Co.
Grolsch 2.5 Pink Grapefruit;Boekelo, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);FÃ¼r ein Fruit ist es gar nicht mal so schlecht. Erfrischend in der SÃ¤ure, leicht bitter und von der Optik her natÃ¼rlich kÃ¼nstlich, aber in Ordnung. Zu meckern bleibt nicht viel, auÃŸer der vollen Chemie, die hier drin stecken mag.
Grolsch 2.5 Pink Grapefruit;Boekelo, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Pours out of the bottle in a light hazy light red colour with no head and thin body. Aroma of light strawberries and dust. Taste of sweet oranges, strawberries and pear. Okay for a fruit beer but just nothing very nice or tasty.
Grolsch 2.5 Pink Grapefruit;Boekelo, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);It has a very nice pink color and the adding op some grapefruit is rather original and makes way for a very nice taste. Both the Grolsch-brand and Grapefruit are bitter but the both compliment each other, perhaps because the watery 2.5 redeems them. Very good summer-beer with a nice fruit-taste.
Grolsch 2.5 Pink Grapefruit;Boekelo, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);like the lemon one, artificial and chemical. Take 1 liter of generic pilsener, 2 liters of water and half a liter of grapefruitjuice.. enjoy. Color is disgusting.
Grolsch 2.5 Pink Grapefruit;Boekelo, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Oh man, I hate grapefruit! So I probably should have known that this wouldn't be my beer. Although the sun was shining and I was looking out to some refreshing beer, this didn't do it for me. But probably because ... I hate grapefruit.
Grolsch 2.5 Pink Grapefruit;Boekelo, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);What can you expect from a beer with 2,5 % alcahol, not much.... To compensate the little taste Pink Grapefruit is added... Not tasty, but if you can't really drink it is a nice alternative. It is a beerry lemonade.. And very watery
Grolsch 2.5 Pink Grapefruit;Boekelo, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Pink golden color. Grapefruit aroma, a bit artificial. Watery thin but fresh, with a strong grapefruit flavor. I can''t understand some low ratings, I''ve had much worse beers, though the aftertaste is a bit annoying.

Grolsch 2.5 Lemon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Radler / Shandy;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Clear yellow color with a small bubbly white head. Lemon aroma. Medium light body. Tad sweet and a mild bitterness. Average carbonation. Quite fresh lemon flavor. [Can from Boni in Odijk, Holland]
Grolsch 2.5 Lemon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Radler / Shandy;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);"Strange take on the low-alcohol concept with trendy bottle, a typical â€™designer beerâ€™. Well, ""beer"" is perhaps a bit too much here: this product is very unbeery. Dense moussy head, snow white, bit rocky, crackling; pale straw blonde colour with vague greenish hue, clear, strong sparkling. Weak aroma primarily centered around an artificial lemon sourishness, almost reminiscent of air freshener or lemon-aromatized dish soap, some sweetish pale malts, some grassy hops, and, to mask the lemon effect, â€™wet dogâ€™ due to hops deteriorating. Very neutral taste dominated by the artificial lemon, though not too agressive, light sweetness, very late hoppy accent in the finish, very thin and watery mouthfeel. I cannot find anything redeeming in this fake product."
Grolsch 2.5 Lemon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Radler / Shandy;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Sweet lemon with still some beer in the background. Color is clear yellow with small head. Very refreshing taste, with still some beer in the background. Great beer in the summer, with not too much alcohol.
Grolsch 2.5 Lemon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Radler / Shandy;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Trinkbar. Mehr aber auch nicht. Pappsuess, leicht kuenstlich und in letzter Konsequenz weit entfernt von Bier jeder Art. Naja...
Grolsch 2.5 Lemon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Radler / Shandy;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Pours out of the bottle in a clear yellow colour with airy low head and thin body. Aroma of mild lemons and mild beer. Taste of mild citrus fruits, lemonade and mild lager beer. Nothing very special or nice.
Grolsch 2.5 Lemon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Radler / Shandy;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Pours yellow with a white head. Aroma is light malt, light grass and lemon peal. Flavour is malt, grass, lemon peal and light soap. Light bitter and watery.
Grolsch 2.5 Lemon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Radler / Shandy;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Pours a clear and pale yellow beer with a white head. The aroma is weak with lemon and synthetic notes. The flavor follows the nose. The palate is dry with sweetness. Overall a boring beer.
Grolsch 2.5 Lemon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Radler / Shandy;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Bottle 250ml. Clear medium yellow colour with a small to average, frothy, fair lacing, mostly diminishing, white head. Aroma is light malty, grain, lemon, cardboard. Flavour is light moderate sweet with a average duration. Body is light to medium, texture is watery, carbonation is soft, finish feel is light metalic. [20111106]
Grolsch 2.5 Lemon;Boekelo, Netherlands;Radler / Shandy;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Bottle. A small, white head sits over a clear, yellowish golden body. Quite weak on the nose, with a touch of pils and a touch of lemon. The flavor has the same problem, or in this case probably the advantage, itâ€™s very weak, both on beer and lemon. Thin on the palate, with some soapy feelings. A ilttle bitterness towards the end. Not horrific in any way this one, but very uninteresting. 111106

Only a tiny bit murky pale yellow body with a quickly collapsing white head. Aroma of doughy yeast and lemon zest with some sweet apples. Apples and emon zest show up in the taste too with notes of sugar syrup, yeast and a bit of spicy phenols. The body is quite light. Nothing super bad, just weaker than how I like a weizen.

Boundary Bay Imperial IPA;Bellingham, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Boundary Bay Brewery;It's been a couple of years since we were at the brewery. We went there with some friends and had to wait 45 minutes to get in. Food, beer and service were excellent. Our friends aren't much into beer, but both were impressed by the food and beer.

Rare, tasty beer, lots of anticipation for this unless youâ€™re in Bellingham. Doesnâ€™t quite live up to the hype, but thatâ€™s a tall order. Not bad, all considered.

Boundary Bay Imperial IPA;Bellingham, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Boundary Bay Brewery;Draught @ Brouwerâ€™s CafÃ©: Â  Vibrant amber, moderate foamy off-white head, nice lacing. Â  A little carbonation too. Â  Resiny nose, citrus side of hoppy, pithy, light alcohol. Â  Bright resiny and citrus peel on the tongue, bitter but not biting, and very warming. Â  Makes my ears warm! Â  Very clean, lingering hoppiness that doesnâ€™t sting. Â  Moderate to full body and mouthfeel. Â  Solid example, lots of flavor, warming, good malt base so the hops arenâ€™t overpowering. Â  I seem to miss this one often, but finally after all these years got to try it officially.

Waimea Cane Fire Red;Waimea, Hawaii, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Waimea Brewing Company;Pine-hoppy nose, but not super piney...more like tettnanger. Caramel maltiness also noticeable. Dark red with a thin white head. Nice caramel malt flavor, very rich with a nice roasted touch in the finish, hops really stand out about half way through a mouthful. Very well balanced, erroring on the side of more hops...not a bad thing. I can tell they used enough of both malt and hops, no skimping. Medium body, slight mineral-like finish.

LaConner Dubbel;LaConner, Washington, United States;Dubbel;LaConner Brewing Company;Huge explosion upon opening. Tons of floating yeast particles. Orange-brown body initially wears a sticky white head with big bubbles. Intense acetic aroma, extremely yeasty. Sour fruits, vinegar, raw wood chunks, tree leaves. Very sharp and pungent and ultimately it doesnâ€™t work out well. Harsh finish with a long leafy bitterness. Was this an infection? Maybe not, but I canâ€™t imagine a brewer aiming for that result. Lively carbonated.

Hazy orange-brown with very active off-white head that recedes to persistent cover. Plenty of yeast in suspension. Brown sugar, sour dough-like yeast with a treacly underlying sweetness.

Sampled with MartinT and Rastacouere.
LaConner Dubbel;LaConner, Washington, United States;Dubbel;LaConner Brewing Company;(Bottle 030) : In the bottom of the murky pond flocculates muscular, sour yeast and chaotic fruit salad and cocoa powder banks...A harsh and unpleasant weirdness lingers in the back and makes me wonder if this was intentional or not...This is FantÃ´me gone awry, a nightmarish marsh plaguing a possibly good idea...

Back Street Magnus Magnus Old Ale;Yorba Linda, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Back Street Brewery (Yorba Linda);(Draft: Pizza Port in San Clemente, CA) Boy, I donâ€™t know, this old ale tastes pretty close to a mediocre Belgian Strong Ale to me. Spicy, moderately sweet, wheaty, slightly sour, and the alcohol is readily apparent. The nose is malty and earthy, but Iâ€™m also getting the mild, yet unmistakeable smell of vinegar throughout this tasting session, though itâ€™s not strong enough to ruin the overall nose. Medium in bodiy with a slightly sticky mouthfeel. Murky, ruddy brown color. Small light tan head fades away to nothing. Kind of an odd beer, and Iâ€™m not all that impressed. It is the $2 special at Pizza Port tonight, so maybe itâ€™s the same keg as they had at the Strong Ale Festival last month and they are trying to get rid of it.

Deschutes Double Bale Quail Imperial IPA;Bend, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Deschutes Brewery;San Diego Real Ale Festival - This was an interesting beer, I thought it was absolutely wonderful. This beer attacks your nose on several different levels as it does on your palate, which could be somewhat confusing. The hops are very aggressive and so is the yeastiness. This is one of those beers that is great right now, but will be even better in a year or two. This is a bit of a palate killer. I had to wait a few samples before I could really sample anything else, as the aggressive hops really did a number on my palate. who knew this recipe would go on to evolve in to so many later beers at the brewery. Lucky I got to try this one.

Deschutes Double Bale Quail Imperial IPA;Bend, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Deschutes Brewery;Pours a very clear amber with a big white head that falls fast. Aroma has a nice balance of sweet malts and big citrus hops. Taste is similar with big sweet caramel front thats desperately needed to combat the big wall of citrus hops to balance it out, and trailing with a big grapefruit finish. This very nicely hides the big alcohol making a nice big IIPA.

Deschutes Double Bale Quail Imperial IPA;Bend, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Deschutes Brewery;"Appearance: a dark, plummish brown color, and a slight, but solid cream-colored head. ""Imperial"" IPA, that doubles as a barleywine, eh? Obviously the Imperialism reflects high alcohol, and that alone should catapult it into barleywine status, if Iâ€™m following their thoughts. With this strength, this hoppiness, and this flavor, it does! Aroma: Fantastic! A buzzing hornetâ€™s nest of hoppiness! Every kind of fruit is set ablaze and swolders away in this astounding nose. Dark cherries, berries, grapes, more, unfolding, showing more alcohol, resembling port wine, dark and leathery, fierce, peppery, stinging, occupying every sense orifice, and becoming akin to taking a deep inhalation of cognac. Hops dominate the mouth on first sip, slowly commanding the senses. Alcohol pretty much takes control, and steers the outcome of every consumption from here on in. Malt does itâ€™s part, too, but the hops, and the booze, never stop! Iâ€™m spinning already, under this influence! Perfectly tasty, lip-smacking texture! Very sweet, delicious, full-flavored! Under more ideal circumstances, controlled laboratory tests, perhaps a more thoughtful or scientific discernment might result, but, alas, this was not my first taste of brew of the night, and I feel like Iâ€™m getting a triple whammy out of this bad boy! A small 12 0z. bottle, but a well-affected, and remembered, experience. As tasty as I like my barleywines, much stronger than my favorite IPAs, oh, so over the top, but exquisitely created! Good job, Deschutes, keep it up!"

The aroma has notes of yeast, fruit, light banana and wheat and a very light hint of alcohol. The sweet flavor has notes of yeast, fruits, light banana, wheat and a touch of alcohol, and the finish is slightly spicy. Not as powerful as I think a Weizen Bock should be in body and flavor!
Sperber BrÃ¤u Herzog Christian August Weisse;Sulzbach-Rosenberg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Sperber BrÃ¤u;50cl bierpost. Typical banana-clove brick of a Weizenbock that could have turned out more drinkable if not for that cloying aspartam sweetness. Pleasant notes of bubblegum and citrus dragged down by soggy, tired wheat. Another example of the style that tells you: this will be your last (if tackling those 50cl alone) without delivering the matching full flavour finale.

Sticky glueish aroma, overriped Granny Smith apple. Medium-bodied, active carbonation. Flavor is also green apple fruity mixed with more standard banana flavors. Short finish. A bit strange.

Ã˜rbÃ¦k Hvede (Weissbier);Ã˜rbÃ¦k, Denmark;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ã˜rbÃ¦k Bryggeri;Very nice rich lather. Light aroma of malt and classic aroma of grain or bread. Good malty flavor with a little more richness than expected for the type. It is perhaps due to the applied spelled malt, well it tastes anyway. A little taste of light rye bread can be suggested until a marked fruit flavors leading to a gentle hop bitterness. It is a little atypical wheat beer, but quite surprising and tasty for the type.

Sweeet fruity light malty aroma, that hasnâ€™t really got the the fruity esters found you would expect from a German Hefe. The taste is much too sweet, syrupy-sweet, not very wheaty. This beer does no harm, I just wish it would do something good, but itâ€™s too simple and too soft, in texture as in carbonation, even to be considered as a plain thirstquencher.

Sweet-sourish, pickles, nettles or other unwanted greenery. Very nutty, sweet-old overoxydized malt notes. Despite the vociferous carbonation, the spirit of the beer is gone. A beer that didnâ€™t stand up to its age. If I find it fresh again, it will mean a new rating. But I fear this is getting characteristic for VS beers...

Clean, light, malty taste, maybe slightly caramelly, bit dull but okay, apart from a vague herbal hoppy touch near the finish, literally nothing else. Drinkable, dull.

Lindeboom Venloosch Alt;Neer, Netherlands;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lindeboom Bierbrouwerij;On keg at De Hems, Soho, London, UK. It pours amber with a small white head. Aroma is malts and caramel mostly. Taste is medium sweet and moderate bitter. Body is medium, texture is watery, carbonation is soft. Overall terrible for me...
Lindeboom Venloosch Alt;Neer, Netherlands;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lindeboom Bierbrouwerij;Bottle. Amber with a quickly fading head and no lacing. Aroma of nuts and caramell. Taste is the same plus some toffee and herbs/spices. Aftertaste is a little bit sour and herbal hoppy. Medium carbonation. A bir watery. Itâ€™s alright but I felt the addition of spices/herbs wasnâ€™t necessary.
Lindeboom Venloosch Alt;Neer, Netherlands;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lindeboom Bierbrouwerij;Draft at Heffer, Amsterdam. Near clear dark amber with an off white head.

Emelisse Dubbel;Goes, Netherlands;Dubbel;Brouwerij Emelisse;Bottle. Clear mid brown with a beige thatâ€™s soon less than a coat. Aroma of toasted grain, dried banana, prunes, mild spices. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Not much in the way of a yeast presence and it seems a bit bald without it - prunes, some caramel, cloves and then off to a quite bitter finish. But its near-brusqueness has its charm too.

Red Star Pumpkin Porter;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Red Star Agave Grille;Sample at the brewpub. Dark brown pour with a medium tan head. Heavily spiced aroma, which is a good thing, but the ratio seemed a bit off. This one was heavy on allspice and clove instead of balanced with the cinnamon. A bit of roasted malt in the nose as well. Spicy flavor with cinnamon and allspice with a bit of roast before a dank finish. Seems like the clean finish is the toughest thing to nail in a spiced beer and these guys definitely struggled with it.
Red Star Pumpkin Porter;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Red Star Agave Grille;Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer pours a black color with a small tan head. The aroma is light sweet malt with a spicy undertone predominantly of nutmeg. The flavor is moderately sweet with strong nutmeg and light cinnamon elements. The finish is a bit nutty. Not terrible but way too much nutmeg for my taste.
Red Star Pumpkin Porter;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Red Star Agave Grille;Draught @ Brew Pub: This was very good. This was the first time that I have someone take a seasonal pumpkin and make the base a porter. It pours an opaque brown with a small tan head. The nose is that of pumpkin spice. Also weak notes of roastiness and chocolate. Very robust malty beer, with taste of the pumpkin spices also. An excellent choice!

Maui Brewing Bikini Blonde Lager;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Maui Brewing Company;24-Nov-08 (12-oz can: Purchased 15-Oct-08 for $2.19 at South Bay Drugs and Liquor in Imperial Beach, CA) Pours a hazy, golden-yellow body and a small, white head that settles to a wide, bubbly ring. Aromas of sweet corn, cheesy grains, and faint hops are backed up on the palate, but the flavor of the mildly bitter Noble hops is much more apparent than in the nose. The beer is noticeably sweet too, so this isn't as dry as a true German Helles. This light-bodied and gently carbonated beer shows no off-flavors and is reasonably clean and refreshing on the palate. Overall, it's a very flavorful pale lager with nice weight and balance, a beer that would go down great on a warm, summer day.
Maui Brewing Hemp Man Brown Ale;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;Brown Ale;Maui Brewing Company;On tap at the Maui Brewing Company Brew Pub. Poured a deeper copper / lighter brownish color with a small sized head. Aromas of caramel and nuts. Tastes of the same with some light toasted malts.

Eriksberg;Falkenberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Sverige;Overall a great beer at a good price from Carlsberg. It is a darker and slightly heavier product from Carlsberg and I personally prefer Eriksberg to Carlsbergâ€™s flagship lighter beer. The malt comes on the nose and the taste in a almost sweet way. Color is a gold/amber and is a great beer to have on a warm or mild day.

Eriksberg;Falkenberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Sverige;"16-02-2019; bottle; at home (bought somewhere in Sweden). The looks of the beer are nice. It looks like a good Premium Lager. The colour of the beer is a lovely golden yellow. The beer is crystal clear. It bubbles lively, which looks really nice. On top of the beer a nice layer of foam was formed. Foam retention is average. The foam is a perfect crispy white. Noice. The aroma of the beer is nice. It is kinda refreshing. Malts give some bready notes, together with a very small touch of caramel. Very nice. Hops give some nice herbal notes, together with a touch of fruit. The aromas are kinda basic, but very nice and strong. Lovely. The taste of the beer is also nice. Kinda sweet malts and nice and strong bitter hops. The beer is well balanced. Some alcohol also gives some extra sweetness. Very nice actually. The palate of the beer is fine. Medium-light body, smooth texture and rather low carbonation compared to the looks (since it looked kinda gassy). The finish of the beer is kinda nice. It has sweet malts and some alcohol and after that some nice bitter hops. Very nice beer. It is refreshing and a good thirst quencher. Not bad."

Wasnâ€™t too big on this one. Smells and tastes bready, lightly grassy, with a cooked vegetable character that I get out of a lot of lagers. Kind of corny, vegetal, and off.

Maritime Pacific Maybock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Maritime Pacific Brewing Co.;One of the last pours on draught at the Jolly Roger brewery/taproom grill in suburban Seattle, WA. Lucky to have visited before this beer ran out. Pours a dark copper amber brew with a thin off-white head that quickly dissipates to a fine film and off-white ring. Aroma of sweetened caramel malts, flowery hops, a touch of Yorkshire pudding with butter and some light spice. Taste is full bodied, a little sweet with flavors of sweetened caramel malt, a touch of apple and some mild fruit cake. Finish is sweet with small bit of citrus hop character that slowly disappears. This is a multi-personality maibock and willing to try this one again. Curious to see how next yearâ€™s batch turns out.
Maritime Pacific Maybock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Maritime Pacific Brewing Co.;On tap at Maritime in Seattle. Red-gold in color. Slight maple/caramel aroma with just a whiff of hops. This is a sweet one, though perhaps less so than other maibocks that Iâ€™ve tried. Still, the sweetness seemed sticky, nearly overpowering some of the other characteristics of the brew. The alcohol shows up after a few sips, and its presence grows as the glass empties. Drinkable, but a wee bit out of balance.

Lightly smoky, dark roasted inky black malt, medium sharpness, quite boozy - bourbon, light sherry sweetness, some sticky marshmallow/vanilla, light spiced biscuit, light to moderate vegetal flavour. Nicely executed porter/stout style â€” body is very thin, which is surprising given the name â€” expected something sludgy and thick.
Port Brewing Old Viscosity;San Marcos, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Port Brewing Company / The Lost Abbey;19.2 oz can from Irvine Spectrum Whole Foods at home in HK. Somehow cans this size seem more enormous than 22 oz bottles. Dark dark cola brown pour with light tan head that dissipates relatively quickly. Very slight lacing. Aroma is roasted chocolate old coffee grounds, some licorice. Sort of straightforward stout. Taste is similar but more sweet, flavor is like straightforward American stout - roasted slightly smoky. Some bitterness. But the name is so misleading. Body is actually very light. More than youâ€™d expect for a big stout. Itâ€™s good, but not anything special about it I guess.

Le Sergent Recruteur Cornemuse;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Scottish Ale;Le Sergent Recruteur - Pizzas & BiÃ¨res Artisanales;First of all, this beer doesn''t have much in common with scotch ales and sure isn''t as good as Le dieu du ciel cornemuse. It has a dark brown colour with a small head. It has a bit of hop and a bit of grapefruit in the aroma. It has a taste of resinous hop sliding on a deceiving sugary note. Definitely not a scotch ale.

Kraftbrau Winter Alt;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kraftbrau Brewery;"This one, probably unfairly, suffers because my own homebrewed alt this winter was the best brew I've ever made and I've been curious about other alts since. I don't get the ""plastic"" that seems to have turned off others, but do sense something odd - maybe an electrical fire whiff? I definitely do get that Kraftbrau sourish quality that seems to work well for some of their brews but intensified in this one, overcompensates the decenter malt action."

Kraftbrau Winter Alt;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kraftbrau Brewery;Bright copper, foamy light tan head. Big aroma of burning plastic with maybe a hint of raisins (and other dark fruit) poking through, touch of citrus. Body is full of light citrusy hops. Orange notes that dry towards the end. I got kind of hung up on the nose, couldn't get past it. It's a really good thing that the aspirations in the aroma don't materialize in the body though.
Kraftbrau Winter Alt;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kraftbrau Brewery;Huge, huge, huge head- should be like that? I mean this was explosion of foam ... Aroma of melted plastic, but when you go past that you can discover something a la Belgian east but a bit flatten and more bitter. You know, this one was hard to rate. I got some good and some bad in it. Ok in middle, dusty aftertaste.
Kraftbrau Winter Alt;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kraftbrau Brewery;A slightly hazy red/brown color. Nice pillowy head, some lace.

Kraftbrau Winter Alt;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kraftbrau Brewery;I thank Psych Prof for this absolutely wonderful Christmas beer.

But the whole is light and drinkable, with a generous head lasting throughout. A master work.

Chestnut brown with a moderate beige covering that quickly dissipates to nyadda. Nose is nutty, molasses, toffee, grain, airy malt. Taste packs more punch, dark fruit rinds, dates, caramel, malt loaf, toasted brown sugar. Full bodied, fine carbonation, warming alcohol in the close. Doesnâ€™t deliver a great deal on the ABV but has held together fairly well and is a drinkable enough sipper.
New Glarus Unplugged Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle shared at Kennyâ€™s 20K tasting - London. Big thanks to Ken himself for this one. Pours clear russet with a light, bubbly head. Mild aroma, light earth, dried fruits. Medium sweet flavour with notes of toasted bread, dried berries, light alcohol. Medium to full bodied with fine carbonation. Warming finish with notes of ripe fruits, dried berries, some bitter earth. Fairly subdued. Not bad.
New Glarus Unplugged Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle share at Chrisoâ€™s at Kennyâ€™s 20K. Many thanks to Ken for bringing this retired eisbock. As â€™New Glarus Unplugged Eisbockâ€™, 9.5%, red foil. Reddy brown, light sediment, small ring of tan head, dotted lacing. Aroma is oxidised, meaty, marmite, some sherry and on-the-turn fruits. Body is medium, smooth, soft carbonation. Taste is boozy, some chocolate, raisin, papery finish. Interesting to try.
New Glarus Unplugged Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;33cl bottle shared at Kennyâ€™s 20K celebrations @Chrisoâ€™s, many thanks to Ken. It pours a dark copper color with no head. Aroma is sweet and quite flat and cardboard with some apricots jam and red berries.

Federation Ace Lager;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);"Thin, watery, palid tripe. No ""Eight Ace"" for me, even at ""Â£1.49"". Avoid or wish you had."
Federation Ace Lager;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Bloody awful stuff. As mentioned very cheap I think it was about 50p a can when I tried it from a local offie. Very weak watered down taste with some slight wheaty hoppy beer taste and smell. This lager is notorious in that a parody of it featured in Viz comic strip 8 Ace.
Federation Ace Lager;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);A lovely Summer drink, nice looking can, golden yellow colour, tastes great ice cold! Summer aromas and a gentle twang on the palet! Even better, itâ€™s Â£1.50 for 8 at Achmeds General Dealers.
Federation Ace Lager;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Can 05/10/2003 Golden coloured and slightly sweet. Wheat flavour. Some dryness in a malt finish.
Federation Ace Lager;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);"Yup - super rank. Comes in a can like the ""generic beer"" on Repo Man. Absolutely tasteless."
Federation Ace Lager;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Must be the cheapest lager in the world. Â£2 ($3.50) for eight 500 ml cans. Not even worth that bargain price it''s so terrible. No flavour, no palete, nothing!
McEwan's Best Scotch;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Used to drink this from 18 to 28 when it seemed to disappear locally. Many landlords couldnâ€™t serve a decent pint of it, very temperamental. Seems that change of maker has given it a new lease of life. Now being served at The Prosseco lounge South Shields and by god itâ€™s a great pint, well kept, good head, cool. Been dropping I. Here occasionally for past 2 years and never a bad pint.
McEwan's Best Scotch;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);3.6% amber with a good smooth head, it tastes the same as most of these smooth bitters, not a fan but they are very easy to drink.
McEwan's Best Scotch;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Keg draught at The Duke of Northumberland, Newcastle upon Tyne. Served very cool. Large frothy off-white head. Clearly not nitrogenated. Very deep amber body. Mostly caramel, but also hoppy and spicy, mild malt and black malt, red fruit and kola nut. If this were on cask it would be quite good. Pretty mild on the taste front, not especially bitter, sort of bittersweet. Slightly oily on the palate. Low to moderate carbonation. Dry finish. Really not too bad. The debate continues: is this a mild or a bitter. I think itâ€™s a hybrid. Itâ€™s like a bitter with lots of caramel in it, and also mild malts. More of a mild I think.
McEwan's Best Scotch;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Keg, The Plough, Ellington, Northumberland. Watery coffee and raisin aroma with nutty attempts. Dark ruby with a creamy white collar. Slightly meaty and gravyish with nuts, hint of dankness, butter, milky coffee, wisp of smoke and cocoa linger. Wishy-washy overchilled mild basically, but enjoyable enough.
McEwan's Best Scotch;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Cask, swan-neck @ the Station, Whitely Bay. Deep, almost blackened chestnut body with a little residual cream to see me back to my table and nothing beyond that. Warming toasted and faintly woody, roasted malt nose. Wooded, peaty and earthy malts in the mouth, quite full and filling. Touch of plastic doesnâ€™t aid it much and some smoky phenols come into play late but remind me of a waterlogged ashtray. Light tannins show on the swallow before a firm grip of malts take hold in the peaty swallow. Rather dusty all up with too much smoke lingering in the mouth for it to come together. Blindly I could drink it all night, but with open eyes it does nothing for me (a metaphor!?!). Average.
McEwan's Best Scotch;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Can. Sweetish, caramelly flavor. Thin. No specific bitterness or other characteristics. Maybe a bit of chichorei. Easy, inoffensive drinker.
McEwan's Best Scotch;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);(Draught). Debatable if this is a bitter or a Scottish ale. Copper coloured. Flavourful, rich malty taste. Low bitterness. Not bad.
McEwan's Best Scotch;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Not that bad for the price. Strong malty taste. Will definatly sample again (but only if price is cheap).
Newcastle Exhibition Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Heineken UK;Keg at Olde Ship Inn, Seahouses. Amber brown colour, creamy white foam head leaving lacing and malty cardboardy aroma. Taste is malty, chocolate hints, with slight fruitiness. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, semi-dry finish. OK, abit bland.
Newcastle Exhibition Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Heineken UK;Draught at The Delaval Arms, Old Hartley, Northumberland. Orange amber with short white head. I hadnâ€™t seen this beer for years, must be very localised now. Thin, watery bitter with boiled caramel flavours. Boiled vegetable notes, musty CO2 hints. Not great.
Newcastle Exhibition Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Heineken UK;Outstanding Full flavor and easy drink to drink. Dark in colour and easy poured.
Newcastle Exhibition Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Heineken UK;Cask@The Kings Head, Lanchester, County Durham. Amber beer with a strong head. The aroma is lightly roasted, and the flavour is mildly toffee and bitter. Overall a reasonable hopped and gently roasted beer.
Newcastle Exhibition Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Heineken UK;Keg draught at the Town Hall Hotel, Richmond, Yorks. Amber body with a thin white head. Nose is caramel and black malt initially. As it warms up from very cold you get spice, hops and fruit. Lightly bitter. Arid dry finish. Oily mouthfeel, which is unpleasant. A bit heavy. Surprisingly decent, like a John Smithâ€™s on steroids.
Newcastle Exhibition Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Heineken UK;First tasted this in Leuchars in August 1994. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale amber in colour with a thin white head. Slight malt note in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt base gives digestive biscuit malt with sweet golden syrup notes. Hop resins give a dusty bitter aftertaste. Finish is rather weak with barley sugar notes dilute in the mouth. A rather insipid bitter.
Newcastle Exhibition Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Heineken UK;Very smooth and easy to drink. Aroma was negligable , a thin head and some lacing. Bitter sweet taste with a light grain and caramel. Many below have argued it is watery and not strong enough. Iâ€™d argue the attraction is that itâ€™s easy to drink and good for sessioning. I really enjoyed this one.
Newcastle Exhibition Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Heineken UK;10/2/10. On tap. Extremely mild and light aroma and flavor. Really tastes like nothing. Meh.
Newcastle Exhibition Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Heineken UK;Draught, swan-neck @ a very small pub (sorry, not noted!!!), Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Shimmering, deep tawny gold with an inch thick pad of cream that lasted but didnâ€™t lace. Void of aroma, though the Geordieâ€™s had the bar well and truly smoked out by now. Thin, watery and soft in the mouth. Bitter, burnt caramel, sweet castor sugar, light toasted grain and plastic with an almost desperate challenging note of earth and ginger. Very little bitterness on the swallow and wishy washy in the finish. This was just another nitro beer in my opinion. Just who invented them. Not much here at all.
Newcastle Exhibition Ale;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Heineken UK;A great ale. In terms of having unique flavor, Newcastle is second to none. The aroma and aftertaste both are very sweet and almost make one think of taffee or maple.
Fremlins Bitter;Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Tasted this in the Salt Cot, Saltcoats (JDW) in April 2010. Cask, handpump dispense. Crystal clear pale copper in colour with a thin white head. Short sulphurous aroma which reminded me of Bass. Thin watery mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives a thin digestive biscuit base with a hint of raisin fruit. Sharp metallic tang of hop resins give a dusty dry flavour to the long aftertaste. A weak finish with a light hazelnut flavour which quickly runs out of legs. A poor session bitter lacking in conviction.
Fremlins Bitter;Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Cask (handpump) @ JDW - The Waterhouse, 67-71 Princess Street, Manchester, Greater Manchester, England M2 4EG. Clear medium orange amber color with a average, frothy to creamy, good lacing, fully lasting, off-white to white head. Aroma is moderate malty, toasted, dusty, light apple, light to moderate hoppy. Flavor is moderate sweet and bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is flat to soft. [20100425]
Fremlins Bitter;Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Cask Handpump at the Penny Black JDW, Northwich 09/04/2010 Floral aroma. Golden bronze coloured and floral with a slightly spicy flavour. Bitter and dry lasting malt finish.
Fremlins Bitter;Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);[Gravity cask at the Back of Beyond, Reading] Amber. Tastes of green leaves and wee wee, with a fair amount of bitterness. Reminded me strongly of Wadworthâ€™s Henryâ€™s IPA, and just as unpleasant.
Fremlins Bitter;Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);A Mes rate. Cask at Baker Street â€™Sporks. Slightly hazy golden brown with a good off white head. Thatâ€™s two beers in a day from this usually poorly cellared Spoons that are in tip top form. I like it when I time it right... Good rustic earthy snout with some faint barnyard character. Even better flavour. A good base formed by what was apparent in the nose but topped off really well with some perfumed and delightfully aromatic hoppage. Really good fruity finish. Bright, alive and very very drinkable. Very good indeed.
Fremlins Bitter;Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Cask at Pilgrimâ€™s Progress (JDW), Bedford, in Spoons Real Ale Festival â€™10. Fremlins: a name from the past, remembered from scores of tin advertisements in pubs with that rather mournful elephant. If I ever drank Fremlins Bitter before it would have been somewhere in East Sussex or West Kent in 1969-70, but in those days I was an uncritical beer drinker, just keen to neck as much of the stuff as possible. This incarnation of the beer is bright amber with a small white head. Rather nice musty sweet malt aroma. Slight sourness and a grainy aftertaste. Rather bland and watery to be honest, but agreeable in many ways.
Fremlins Bitter;Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Hand pulled cask at The Moon Uner Water (JDW) Watford. Amber with a small white head. This really does taste pretty much as I remember it back in the 80s. A well balanced session bitter with distinctive styrian goldings floral notes. A
Fremlins Bitter;Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Cask conditioned handpump Last Plantaganet Leicester. An amber coloured beer with a whitish lasting head. The aroma has a little citrus together with the house yeasty note. Itâ€™s the same in the mouth where there are earthy floral notes. Itâ€™s pretty reasonable.
Fremlins Bitter;Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Cask, Last Plantagenet, Leicester. Amber gold with an off-white foam. Aromas are biscuit and toffee malts with oranges and spices. Some grapefruit with floral aspects. Flavours are toffee malts with tea and light oranges. Sweet pineapple chewits sweets with hints of nuttiness. Traces of sulphur and some yeast. Dry on the finish. A tasty low alcohol beer.
Fremlins Bitter;Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);"Cask at the Regal (JDW), Cambridge. Amber with a ring of white head; straightforward fruity aroma; thin and watery with some sweet malts; and a light herbal bitter finish. Rather ordinary."

B&T Santa's Slayer;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;B&T Brewery;Cask @ a spoons. A low boost golde thatâ€™s anorexic on body or palate, and quite frankly not very festive. A gimmick name and concept. Flavours of bready malts, lemon hops, citrus. Really mundane.
B&T Santa's Slayer;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;B&T Brewery;Cask handpull at The Crosse Keys Bishopsgate as â€™Banks and Taylor Santaâ€™s Slayerâ€™. Golden yellow clear still foamy white head. Aroma is bready, light citrus. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is grainy, white bread, gluey, dusty, light bitterness. A nice and very drinkable balanced golden bitter. Looking through the ratings consistency might be a problem, but very good on this showing.
B&T Santa's Slayer;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;B&T Brewery;Bit bland. Grassy and mild malt. Hint of sulphur doesnâ€™t help. Really nothing special.

Had to have a Northumberland beer to complete the English county set; wish I hadnâ€™t had this one. It may have been not quite in the best of nick.

Budels Kikbier Alcoholvrij;Budel, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Budelse Brouwerij;Rather boring looking fizzy drink. Oh, and head is already gone before even first sip. That was quick. Color is light. Look brings sima (mead) to my mind. Damp smell. I immediately remembered some earlier non alcoholic beer I had, which was dreadful. But this one has better, thou quite bad taste. This liquid is watery and tastes contaminated. Never the less this is not bad enough that I would pour glass away.
Budels Kikbier Alcoholvrij;Budel, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Budelse Brouwerij;Bottle@Home. Rhubarbre aroma. Pale golden colour, white head, good lace. Very sweet, rhubarbre, bisquits, light bitter. Quite yuck!

Amber in colour, decent clarity with just maybe a touch of haze from the sediment. Suprisingly sweet, there is a touch of oxidisation.

Courage Ceremonial Ale;Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Fountain (Scottish Courage - Scottish & Newcastle);"1981 Bottle from the Wedding of Charles and Di. Aroma was fruity and boozy, but the pour had me disappointed right away. It was a very viscous and cloudy brown. My suspicions were confirmed upon tasting; This has long gone bad. Total drain pour because it no longer tasted like beer. It just tasted, well, awful. Spoiled."
Amherst Heather Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Amherst Brewing Company;Tap at pub. Looks exactly like the ipa, orageish with no head or lace. Super flowery but in a fake, Glade or cleaner sort of way. Tastes like youâ€™re drinking a candle. Maybe too much heather? Donâ€™t remember this beer being so potent.
Amherst Heather Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Amherst Brewing Company;"My Bottom Line: Flowery heather notes bloom throughout the humble blond ale base of this crisp and very drinkable session ale. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the lightly hazy blond. -The body is lean and the carbonation rather prickly. -The heather flavor is well levelled; obvious but never bothersome. -Bitterness is very low, and this finish is even a tad watery at times. -This is somewhat reminiscent of Dieu du Cielâ€™s RosÃ©e dâ€™Hibiscus in its flavor profile and aroma, but the witbier base of the DDC beer is much more appropriate imho. On tap at the brewpub."
Amherst Heather Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Amherst Brewing Company;Draught pint at the brewpub, October 14 2007. It shows a clear, oily amber-gold with no head to speak of....the nose is faintly herbal, grassy and peppery, with perhaps a touch of diacetyl though not enough to totally ruin it....body is again herbal/bitter, sweet, somewhat syrupy, grassy and oily towards the finish....low carbonation and thick mouthfeel make it slightly tough to drink....not bad, I rather enjoyed it by the finish, but nothing Iâ€™m likely to drink again, either.
Amherst Heather Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Amherst Brewing Company;Poured with a nice initial head and good lacing rings. The aroma was of, surprise, heather, more than anything else. The flavor followed suit, but this thing had some sort of a sweet candy type influence, almost coming across soda-pop-like, heater soda or something. Very strongly carbonated, too sweet, and that heather stuff in there too (all too much).
Amherst Heather Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Amherst Brewing Company;Aroma is light tree bark, and although I smell mint, Mike the brewer says itâ€™s just heather and honey. The honey blossoms are really pronounced and come right up to the front. There is still the issue of spiciness what I am calling spearmint. So very well done, I am really impressed. By far the best heather ale Iâ€™ve had. Iâ€™d drink this often.
Amherst Heather Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Amherst Brewing Company;on tap at the brewpub. Clear amber pour with no head. Malty aroma, very faint. Light body, floral flavors, but not overpoweringly sweet. Easy drinking, low carbonation. An interesting change of pace.
Amherst Heather Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Amherst Brewing Company;3 ounce sample at the brewpub. Aroma is interesting...cant really put my finger on it...lots of floral, sweet, and fruity notes in the nose. Mildly hazy copper color with virtually no head--ugly beer. Floral berry-like aroma...perhaps juniper berries are present as well? Lots of this floral flavor to start, with a bit of licorice to follow. Finishes thin and pretty bland and flavorless.
Amherst Heather Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Amherst Brewing Company;Very interesting ale. Award-winner and probably deservedly. A bit too fizzy for me, but itâ€™s a very refreshing winter beer.
Amherst Heather Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Amherst Brewing Company;On draught Feb 2005 at the brewery. Copper colored beer, with a small off-white head, good retention. Mostly clear body. Aroma of leafy, fuzzy, dry, astringent heather and little else. Not a very intense aroma. Flavor is even worse, with a sharp, spritzy carbonation and a dry, almost meaty-like flavor. Soured and yet light, maibockaddict isnt offended, claiming it is a good summer ale. I agree, but I guess I was looking for something more substantial. Perhaps Iâ€™m ruined by Town Hallâ€™s version, but this one didnt cut it. Very oddly, it has a medium to medium-full body, with a chewy sweetness and lots to ponder as you drink it. It took me a while to finish, as I wasnt a big fan of the veggies and meat. Maybe Iâ€™m just crazy. . .
Amherst Heather Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Amherst Brewing Company;On tap: Hazy amber hue with orange tint. Small white head with almost no lace. Aroma was like a Witbier but got heather notes instead of wheat and not as spicy. Detected some earthy yeast, grain, banana, dust. Old school. Twangy and earthy taste up front with a smooth herbal dry finish. Light to medium-bodied with a creamy and lively mouthfeel. Damn, a near carbon copy of Fraoch Ale but even better, fresher makes it so. Don't let the appearance fool you, this beer rocks! Works great with clam chowder. Medal winner at the GABF.
Allegheny Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Cream Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;WARNING, Not one of the 12 GREATEST BREW! I have to sample all 12, as my wife got this for me and with her not liking ratebeer as it is, I want her to think she did good. The thought counts. Drap
Allegheny Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Cream Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"A novel idea. ""12 greatest beers of the world"". But, no let's make a batch of amber bottle it and put different labels on it. OK, not quite true, but The differences between these beers, even though said to be different style was scary. All would have done well in a amber ale competition."
Allegheny Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Cream Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"Man.. I WANTED to like these beers. A great idea to do a multi pack with this theme. The packaging was nice and informative.. and I like for beer to come in pint bottles. ;) But the smell and taste is sour. All the beers in the pack taste alike and have some odd nuclear red/orange color. It smells and tastes foul. I will say that some are less foul than others in this pack... but this isn't one of them. I read here someone saying they would rather drink Budweiser and I scoffed... I no longer scoff."
Allegheny Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Cream Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Good Fucking Christ. That about sums it up, but I was acknowledged that there is a seventy five character minimum to a rating and therefore I will continue you writing this sentance until I reach seventy five. Some beers can be summed up in a few words, there is no need for more brutality.
Allegheny Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Cream Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;As with the rest of the beers from this sampler pack - this was terrible. Orangeish pour with a decent head - but the taste is just plain bad or nonexistent - I can''t decide.
Allegheny Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Cream Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"Part of the ""12 Greatest Brews of the World"" sampler pack found at my local Wal-Mart. If this is one of the ""best beers"", I would hate to try the worst. Actually this wasn''t awful, it just doesn''t really taste like anything. Pours an orange color with a thick foamy head and thin lacing. Aroma is indeed creamy. There was really nothing to the flavor at all, it was mostly sweet creamy carbonation. I guess no flavor is better than bad flavor."
Free State Holiday Ale 2002;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Strong Ale - American;Free State Brewing Company;Deep amber, looked like cinnamon, but holiday spice flavors are muted--perhaps I shouldn''t have been looking for them. Well rounded and smooth, showing its alcohol a bit more than other high-abv beers from Free State.
Free State Holiday Ale 2002;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Strong Ale - American;Free State Brewing Company;"Really delicious stuff. Along the lines of Boulevard's Nutcracker Ale, but a lot more of everything. Less of a spiced beer than a strong ale. This is the hoppiest beer Free State offers. It is also very creamy, with a nice dry finish. This is a nice varied hoppy beer with plenty of malt to counterbalance the bitterness. RERATE, 12/15/02. I admit to rating this last night off of a few healthy sips. I liked it a lot, though, so we got a growler today. Even better than I remembered--a fiery orange red color with a smooth buttery texture. Very spicy. This is a unique beer; I've never had anything quite like it. You just have to try it to understand."
Free State Holiday Ale 2002;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Strong Ale - American;Free State Brewing Company;A blend of lightly citrusy fruit, pine, nut and light caramel in the aroma. Bright red color, clear with a short-lasting white head. A slight amount of candyish, berry-like fruity malt sweetness, followed by deep, earthy, hop flavors and on into the spicy, dry finish. Aftertaste holds some malt sweetness and piney hop. Medium body and rather light on the palate, not too carbonated. Tasty and flavorful.
Free State Holiday Ale 2002;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Strong Ale - American;Free State Brewing Company;I actually liked this one better than the Boulevard Nutcracker...it seemed to have more flavor to me or perhaps it just stood out more, as this was the first beer of the night. Fairly complex and I'll get this again before its gone.
Kulmbacher Export;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Bottle at Beerdock Leek. Pours a clear golden colour with a medium white head. Aroma of bready malts, a little lemon and slight spicy, herbal hops. Taste of bready malts, grain, slight lemon and subtle spicy, herbal hops. Light bodied and moderate carbonation. A crisp and dry, spicy, herbal hop bitterness in the finish. Typically dank initially then German hops and malt. Decent Helles.
Kulmbacher Export;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);En udemÃ¦rket pilsner af lidt stÃ¦rkere karakter. Den har fin maltsÃ¸dme og en god smag af humle.
Kulmbacher Export;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);500ml bottle from beershop.bg, drunk at home on an icy January evening. Pours crystal clear with a finely fluffy head that lasted a minute before settling to a surface mist, heavy lacing and persistent rising carbonation. Straw in colour. On the nose, faint flowers, herbs and hay over a base of biscuity malt. In the mouth, high carbonation initially gives a frothy mouth feel that soon gives way to thin, dry bitterness, bread and biscuity malts predominate the flavours with hints of floral honey, before a short, metallic bitter finish. Overall, just another dull example of a dull style, but with no major flaws, it could be crisp and refreshing at the right time and place.
Kulmbacher Export;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Clean lager smells over a malt vinegar tinge on the nose. Very enjoyable, mild lager to drink. I'd put this on a par with their Landbier and Kellerbier--big fan of this brewery--though not up there with their stellar MÃ¶nchshofs Original Pils. You get that lovely Bavarian malty flavour, some light ryebreadiness, and subtle hop notes round the sides of the palate. Slightly watery and innocuous, but I could drink this all day.
Kulmbacher Export;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Bottle. Light to moderate grain and bread for the malt, light herbs for the hops, light dough and dried leaves for the yeast. Head is small, frothy, white, with a spot or two of lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is sparkling clear gold. Flavor starts faintly sweet and slightly acidic, then finishes lightly acidic and faintly bitter. Palate is light, watery, with a lively to fizzy carbonation. Straight up Helles, that is in perfect balance and is real easy drinking.

On tap at Seven Bridges in Jacksonville, FL, thanks to Aaron the brewer! Cleer deep brown pour, plenty of red under the light, with a big creamy tan head that cuts but coats the glass fully. Light milk chocolate and sweet malt on the aroma. Creamy milk chocolate taste with some roasted bitterness, hop bitterness and character, and a touch of acidity. Light bodied, smooth, and easy drinking. Tasty stuff, actually!

Big River Grille Winters Nip Winter Porter;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Had on tap at the Nashville location as Winter Porter, given the new designation of a Winter Bock it seems like the Winters Nip designation isnâ€™t so much a beer of its own anymore, only a seasonal name. So Iâ€™m putting this here. Dark brown-red, dark tan head. Roast aroma, sweet and bitter chocolates, cocoa, caramel sweetness. Roasty, chocolate taste, full body. Light roasty bitter astringent finish.
Big River Grille Winters Nip Winter Porter;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);The aroma is a bit off but has all the basic elements of a porter, toasted malt, coffee, and chocolate (all be it very weak).

Irregular, off-white head on a deeply peach blonde-coloured, cloudy beer; nose gets banana, floral hops, vanilla, caramel, pear brandy, whisky; taste fruity and yeasty with a light hop bitterness and warming alcohol in the end. The low ratings here surprise me a bit, but then I tasted it many years ago when it had just come onto the market and possibly the quality has declined since then - in other words, time for a re-rating when I find another bottle."
Brootcoorens AngÃ©lus SpÃ©ciale NoÃ«l 7%;Erquelinnes, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Brootcoorens Erquelinnes;75 cl. bottle sampled @ Kerstbierfestival Essen 2013. Limited to 900 litres, brewed in Feb in 2013. Yet another new BE brewery for me, I thought that I had done at least one beer from the majority of BE breweries, Essen proved me very wrong by presenting me lots of beers from breweries I had never heard of before. Clear orange / golden with no head. Smells of sweet oranges, carries an infection, slightly boozy, fruity, something off courtesy of what appears to be an infection. Taste is bitter & infected, sour tang, bitter spices, hay, berries & flat. Questionable whether or not this should be even sold but so are things with beer.

La 1900 SpÃ©ciale Bonnes FÃªtes;GÃ©rouville, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Gigi de l'Etoile;"Very unusual winter beer since it comes from a very low-profile brewery which otherwise produces only table beers.

Dunwoodies American Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;From old tasting notes. Auburn liquid topped by a foamy beige head. Sweet toasted malt aroma remiscent of baked bread. Tangy sweet malt flavor has decent balance from a spicy hop finish.
Dunwoodies American Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;WARNING, Not one of the 12 GREATEST BREW! I have to sample all 12, as my wife got this for me and with her not liking ratebeer as it is, I want her to think she did good. The thought counts.
Dunwoodies American Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"A novel idea. ""12 greatest beers of the world"". But, no, let's make a batch of amber, bottle it and put different labels on it. OK, not quite true, but The differences between these beers, even though said to be different styles was scary. All would have done well in a amber ale competition."
Dunwoodies American Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"I detected alcohol in this one!!!! Yes, hidden behind wet dog aromas, dumpster juice palate, and incredibly bad looking glass full of urine-yellow ""beer"". I drank my glass full. You should all be proud of me. We passed a sample of this down to the end of the bar (we took our twelve pack to the bar for kicks- and sample with the bartender) and the sucker who tried it said, ""this tastes like Guinness"". He obviously works for the piss poor brewers at Gluek."
Dunwoodies American Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Well, after tasting this I would have named it american brown shit. Shameless. This is yet another of the so called twelve greatest beers.
Dunwoodies American Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;As with the rest of the beers from this sampler pack - this was terrible. A bright orange nut brown. Unbelievable. Tastes the same as all the other beers from this pack. It is very hard to discern between the scottish ale, the stout, the porter and the nut brown. They taste and look like almost the same beer. Crazy.
Dunwoodies American Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"Part of the ""12 Greatest Brews of the World"" sampler pack found at my local Wal-Mart. I really wasn''t surprised that this beer was not brown after trying their Scottish Red Ale which was orange. This was orange too, with a thin off-white head. Barely any malt aroma. Flavor was nothing to write home about either, alternating between sour and lightly malty. Faintly nutty dry finish. Another loser."

Cloudy medium yellow. Slim white rim. Big sharply sweet green apple nose. Watery body. Green apple mid-palate. Slightly fruit sour finish. More like a bad wit than a bad saison...very frustrating and disappointing. Didnâ€™t expect to try something from the Northgate Ram that was this far off the mark.
Big Horn Saison;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Pint - Ram Big Horn - Kent, WA Aroma â€“ Nice earthy floral malt aroma with a lingering of hops. Appearance â€“ Straw gold in color, clear, with a thin head. Flavor â€“ Great malt flavors with some nice spices and added floral hops to add to the flavor. Palate â€“ Great Mouthfeel, Good texture with a dry finish. Overall â€“ This was a very nice Saison beer. It is a hard beer to brew and not over power with hops and they did a great job.
Big Horn Saison;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Draught @ Brouwerâ€™s CafÃ©: Dark straw, somewhat hazy, large foamy white head, moderate carbonation, fairly nice lacing. &nbsp Tart floral nose, a little smidgen of straw or grass. &nbsp Soft tart grassiness on the tongue, has an airy floralness, a little musty. &nbsp Had you given me this and said it was an American brew, I would have said get outta here! &nbsp More tart/floral than bready, which I seem to find with most American examples, but not this one. &nbsp Fairly dry as well. Dave, yer doing one hell of a job over there!
Big Horn Saison;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Multiple samples, GABF 2006 (as South Hill Saison, made at the Puyallup, WA location). Body is medium to dark yellow. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain), lightly to moderately yeasty (cobwebs, mold), with notes of clove, lemon, plastic, and dried apricot. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation. Pretty good, and from Big Horn even.
Big Horn Saison;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);"(Westminster, CO, C.B.& Potts) Clean, fresh, yeasty nose. Moderately carbonated. Subtle spices with hints of banana and clove; big bubblegum flavors too. Finishes bitterish and a little dry. Warming alcohol sensation. Nice lace patterns. Not the best malt flavors; kind of light. Overall, extremely drinkable, but not enough ""Belgian"" ooomphh."
Banberry & Edwards India Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Cold Spring Brewery;From old tasting notes. Amber orang color topped by a creamy beige head. Faint sweet malt aroma. Tangy fruity malt flavor. Faint hoppy finish.
Banberry & Edwards India Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Cold Spring Brewery;WARNING, Not one of the 12 GREATEST BREW! I have to sample all 12, as my wife got this for me and with her not liking ratebeer as it is, I want her to think she did good. The thought counts.
Banberry & Edwards India Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Cold Spring Brewery;"A novel idea. ""12 greatest beers of the world"". But, no, let's make a batch of amber, bottle it and put different labels on it. OK, not quite true, but The differences between these beers, even though said to be different style was scary. All would have done well in a amber ale competition."
Banberry & Edwards India Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Cold Spring Brewery;Banana Republic label, stale Coors Light with cigar tobacco, vegetable oil, and recyled newspaper additives. The sad thing about this whole rating is the fact that I will end up in the top fifty raters becuase of this twelve pack. Guilt builds, but I'm downthing them (at least my taster glass full)!!
Banberry & Edwards India Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Cold Spring Brewery;I am not sure how to differentiate this from the rest of the carbonated vomit in this twelve pack... wait wait.. I will not just cut and paste.. I will mention that this is the least offensive of the swill-medley. But to call it a pale ale is like calling a sheetrock screw a watermelon.
Banberry & Edwards India Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Cold Spring Brewery;All I can say is that there was a cool elephant on the cover ..............
Banberry & Edwards India Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Cold Spring Brewery;As with the rest of the beers from this sampler pack - this was terrible. Fizzy golden orangish slightly hoppy - and I mean SLIGHTLY. By far the worst IPA ever.
Banberry & Edwards India Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Cold Spring Brewery;"Part of the ""12 Greatest Brews of the World"" sampler pack found at my local Wal-Mart. I have to give credit to the labels of these beers because they are actually quite informative. You can learn a lot about how particular beers are made and how they get their names. Unfortunately, the knowledge to glean only serves to make you realize how horribly wrong these beers are compared to what they should be. Case in point: This beer pours a dark yellow color with a thick white head. Slight floral hops aroma. Probably the least hops bite in any IPA I have ever had. This is still one of the better Old European brews I have had though, because it is not as sour and dry as the others. Still a pathetic rendition of an IPA though."
Harviestoun Black to Front;Alva, Scotland;Stout;Harviestoun Brewery;Sampled cask conditioned at Oliver Twist, Stockholm, Sweden. Black with beige head. Really roasty. Surprising sweet creaminess. Am I imagining the wheat malt flavour? Medium body with a short blast of salt and a lingering licorice flavour. Pleasant dry bitter finish. Yummy!!
Dieu du Ciel! PremiÃ¨re Neige;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Bottle at Benâ€™s over christmas. What a drink! Garvie just kind of grabbed it and started opening it. I though he was joking until it was clear that he wasnâ€™t. A totally wonderful cider with a pure undistilled apple flavour. So delicious and festive on a cold evening. Cheers Ben.

Dieu du Ciel! PremiÃ¨re Neige;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;On tap at Dieu du ciel. The color is a hazy gold with a thick beige head.The aroma is of herbs and fruits.The taste also of herbs like anis,nutmeg and others as for fruits it was mostly bananas.The finish in the mouth was bitter but not to much.

Un col mousseux modÃ©rÃ©ment gÃ©nÃ©reux. Une dentelle. Un nez bien occupÃ© par les Ã©pices. Un doux parfum de blÃ© acidulÃ©. Une banane Ã©crasÃ©e, des herbes et du citron. Une fois bien tempÃ©rÃ©, lâ€™anis se dÃ©voile davantage que la muscade. Des saveurs a priori fortes en muscade et pratiquement mentholÃ©es par la prÃ©sence de lâ€™anis. Des houblons qui surprennent et toujours cette banane qui traverse le chemin de mes papilles. Un blÃ© accompagnateur et mordant. En bouche, un corps construit selon les normes de la maison.

Dieu du Ciel! PremiÃ¨re Neige;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Aroma as mentioned has anise, some bitters and gin, (didnâ€™t get nutmeg) hazy yellow, tiny white head, lace. Flavour of wheat is overwhelmed by anise and nutmeg mix, seems like lemon gin, a bit unusual, for my taste, but I applaud the novelty here. Another unique offering.
Dieu du Ciel! PremiÃ¨re Neige;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Tap at the Brewpub: Pours cloudy light yellow with minimal white head. Zesty wheat dominates the nose, with a touch of old lemon peel and dusty phenols. Crispy feel with a perfumy/citric flavor. Touch of lemon peel here as well, with a anisette suggestion and a white pepper presence as well. Pretty good, not great.
Dieu du Ciel! PremiÃ¨re Neige;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Lightly hazy golden yellow body with a creamy white head (3+). Moderate licorice and anise notes in the aroma, tough to tease apart spices. Stronger anise in the flavour, with a milder nutmeg partners, and light bitterness in the finish lingers in to the aftertaste along with the anise. (8+) Average palate is pleasantly effervescent. I very much liked this one, but I donâ€™t know that I could consume more than a glass or two in a sitting.
Russell Winter Porter;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Russell Brewing Company;"Cask at Tap & Barrel, Olympic Village Near black, with generous compact head. The aroma is mild, lightly sour. Lean body, soft, lowly carbonated; the flavor is very chocolatey, much better than ash-forward sister beers. Correct bitterness. Light lactose feeling, light residual sweetness. On cask, very enjoyable!"
Russell Winter Porter;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Russell Brewing Company;2008-10-15. Very dark brown black body, nice beige head fades. (3+) Aroma of tangy acidic roast. Flavour has tangy acidic overtones, mild roast, some interesting highlights. Average to thin bodied palate is rather light for a porter. More acidity than I would like to see, and I suspect more than was intended by the brewer as well.
Russell Winter Porter;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Russell Brewing Company;9/7/08 On draught at Las Maragaritas, Vancouver, BC. Aroma is quite chocolatey, somewhat smoky with a light creamy sweetness. Appearance is dark brown with a moderate maintained cream colored head. Flavor is sweet, slightly sour malt forward with medium sweet roast bittering. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a moderate carb texture. Overall, this is a great porter for people that like malty sweet beers.
Russell Winter Porter;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Russell Brewing Company;Roast sour nose. Fairly dark, creamy brown head. Chocolaty notes on a honey malt base. Earthy, infected ? lightbodied, mellow moutfeel.
Russell Winter Porter;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Russell Brewing Company;Donâ€™t know if this is still available but used to drink it often. A decent, quaffable beer that is, as other raters have noted, under-carbonated and a tad sweet. However, the mild palate is a nice change of pace from the overcarbonated microbrews usually available in Vancouver.

Russell Winter Porter;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Russell Brewing Company;Pours a dark purple-black with virtually no head. Strong aroma of blackberries, maybe some dark cherry in there somewhere, too. Tastes of dark and amber malt (not particularly roasty) with slight hopping, and a sweet blackberry & plum taste, aftertaste of pumpkin seed. Body is thin and water, low in carbonation (from the tap at Dentryâ€™s!) Nice tasting beer, but a bit too sweet, thin, and under-carbonated.
Russell Winter Porter;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Russell Brewing Company;(Bottle) Shared at the PNW Christmas 2006 party at Oakes on December 9th. Thin white head with a deep brown body. Nose of sweet coffee. Flavour is smooth with a bitter cocoa and leafy undertone. Somewhat uninspired.
Russell Winter Porter;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Russell Brewing Company;"Dark brown appearance with a thin tan head. Odd sort of fermented smell. The taste was definetly off I donâ€™t know how to decribe it other than ""fishy"". I may have to try it again."
Russell Winter Porter;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Russell Brewing Company;Dark amber brown colour. Slightly spicy, coffeeish, almondy aroma. Slight, thin body is toasty with a bit of coffee.
Pacific Rim Castaway Winter Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Hard Liver 08. Too bad this one was obviously bad because it seems as if it was one a nice brew. Dark amber pour with a nice head. The aroma has notes of cinnamon, pumpkin spice, pickles, medicine. The flavor is vinegar, sour, spicy like lotion, soap or cologne. Pretty much god awful.
Pacific Rim Castaway Winter Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;had at hardliver fest at brouwerâ€™s in fremont. tasted a bit syrupy like cough medicine.
Pacific Rim Castaway Winter Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;"snifter @ beverage place barleywine bacchanal - 2006 vintage; clear and ark copper; aromas of stale malts and sour juice; drinks like bad ginger ale; maybe past its prime and i couldnâ€™t finish even the small glass"
Pacific Rim Castaway Winter Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Dark cherry red. Flat w/ no head at all. Minty floral aroma...smells like this Czech liquor called Becherovka(floral with a bit of anise). First impression of the taste is a bit of chocolate mint! Slight alcohol kick...almost a medicinal taste, but not in a bad way. Very different, but I love it.
Pacific Rim Castaway Winter Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Tap: Light head and lacing. Amber color. Nose of fruit and esters, strong grape and raspberry notes along with the citrusy hops and caramel malts. Sweet and strong, syruppy. Finishes strong. Good and fairly smooth.
Pacific Rim Castaway Winter Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;"Draught Chestnut-amber, no head. Very hoppy & portwine aroma; alcoholic nose, fruity & grapey. Lots of ethanol and higher alcohols. Cardemom. Quite bitter taste, with sweet, fruity, vinous and foremost alcoholic undertones, cakey. Chewy mouthfeel, very full bodied. Definitely good, but it seems a bit just want too much to BE a barley wine ""If we donâ€™t meet al 35 style requirements plus American hops, weâ€™re not gonna make it""..."
Pacific Rim Castaway Winter Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Bright amber...pretty beer. Curranty, soapy aroma. Big, sweet, chewy barley wine with a lot of toffee and earthy hops. Assertive bitterness...you could mistake this for Big Foot.
Pacific Rim Castaway Winter Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;2006 Vintage - This is a fine example of what the NW is doing with its Barleywines. A sweet malty aroma, along with a hop aroma that is somewhat musky and resiny, and some caramalized brown sugar, vanill frosting notes in the flavor, with a very well balanced malt character. Very nice.
Pacific Rim Castaway Winter Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Tap at the 2006 Hard Liver Festival. 2006 vintage. Rich garnet colour, thin white head. Aroma is of sweet chewy malts, subtle cascade hop aroma, brown sugar. Malts are clean and well balanced. A fairly typical PNW barleywine. Good body. Some light anise notes and peppery alcohol.
Pacific Rim Castaway Winter Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;An alluring amber appearance with a creamyish amber head. This beer was almost cloyingly sweet of cherries. However, the flavor is a bit unbalancedly sweet. I anticipate that this beer would age well and better reconcile the disparate elements. A barleywine with potential, but did not strike me well with this particular tasting.
Shirokirin Winter Is Wonderful;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Canned. Very pale, very thin. A wonder that they can make such claims on the can and then deliver sucha a sad product. No bad taste, just nobody home!
Shirokirin Winter Is Wonderful;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Can, 2007. Very clean, clear golden with a medium, foamy head. Sweet malts, and starch complete the aroma, oh boy... Sharp, thin mouth. I was hoping for something special in this seasonal, but isâ€™s just another tasteless macro from Japan. Theyâ€™re all the same.
Shirokirin Winter Is Wonderful;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);"2006; reads ""rich taste"" than ""winter is wonderful"" / not offensive, and quite quaffable, but i canâ€™t see myself sucking down a pitcher; fizzy and grainy, generic tea, light yet noticeable."
Shirokirin Winter Is Wonderful;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);"Of the four new Japanese Macro's I tasted in this sitting,this one was the least offensive. A typical ""yellow fizzy"" beer with Rice and Corn starch adjuncts (There's your bad smell Nesta). The Japanese always like to try new things, be they electronic gadjets or beers. These are all pretty much the same bland beers in new eye-catching packaging with slick campaign ads to capture the young new beer drinker. No talking frogs though."
Shirokirin Winter Is Wonderful;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Winter might be wonderful but this is absolute rubbish. Really stinks. Easily the worst smelling beer I''ve encoutered. The only thing I can say for it is that it tastes better than it smells - but not by a great deal.
Copper Crow Holiday Cheer;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Copper Crow Beer Company;Butterscotch Scents dominate the aroma of this fine seasonal brew. The tasting yields both the butterscotch flavoring as well as vanilla overtones. Smooth finish ends clean without too much sweetness. Overall an great seasonal beer!
Copper Crow Holiday Cheer;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Copper Crow Beer Company;Draft before Christmas: Poured a reddish amber with a nice head. The aroma was Christmas in a bottle, lots of spices. The flavor was nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, and sweet malts. Overall, it was a just that, a holiday cheer.
Copper Crow Holiday Cheer;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Copper Crow Beer Company;Reddish-amber color with a very spicy aroma that features some sugar & cinnamon. Flavor is sweet, bready and spicy with Nutmeg, allspice, and some cinnamon. OK. but toning down the spices would improve this one.
Copper Crow Holiday Cheer;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Copper Crow Beer Company;On tap at the brewery. Sour vinegar and tart fruity nose on this, with some soy sauce. Odd tangy quality to this one for sure. Smells like a sour ale more than anything, with some woody presence. Dark cloudy amber-brown, with thin off-white head. Medium watery body with medium carbonation. Quite an interesting mix of flavors - reminding me of the fruitcake taste from an early-90s Amry MRE. Cranberry and orange peels, cinammon and a nutty bitter quality, clove, and sweet short bread. Very interesting and Iâ€™m not sure if I could drink a lot of this. Mild fruity tart finish with little bitterness. Not bad, but not a fave.
Copper Crow Holiday Cheer;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Copper Crow Beer Company;Transparent dark copper amber with ruby hues and a nicely-lacing off-white froth of head. Aroma of sweet ginger and clove with some caramel malt and a touch of nutmeg. Body starts thick and well-spiced with a good bit of earthy dark caramel and some lightly tart cranberries. A good holiday ale with nice complexity of flavors and balance.
Copper Crow Holiday Cheer;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Copper Crow Beer Company;On draft at the brewery: pours a dark reddish brown with a bit of a spicy aroma but I didnâ€™t pick up much more than that, taste was nutmeg with a cinnamon lingering aftertaste - but not very strong. I actually thought this was pretty good.
Copper Crow Holiday Cheer;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Copper Crow Beer Company;On draft at the Inn. Poured reddish brown with minimal head (as usual) that left the slightest of lacings. Flavor consisted of malts with some spices, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves.
Copper Crow Holiday Cheer;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Copper Crow Beer Company;This years batch was brewed w/ the second runnings of a 275th anniversary brew that will be released in 2007. The abv is bumped up from the posted amount(now 8 %)...man that anniversary brew must be potent as heck. I canâ€™t wait! Appears a murky, reddish brown, with a 2 finger, tan head that slowly fades out. Lots of lacing is scattered around the pint glass. Smell is of the anticipated cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, allspice, highligted by cranberries. I was also getting a whiff of juniper berries in there but all those mulling spices may just be playing tricks on my mind before the holidays arrive. Taste is of the mentioned aromas in a slightly fruity, malty, brown sugar infused flavor that seems to be what they were shooting for. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spicy, smooth, with decent CO2 levels that lead to a semi-dry finish of cinnamon and nutmeg.
Copper Crow Holiday Cheer;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Copper Crow Beer Company;On tap at the GLI. Poured a medium, cloudy reddish-brown color with a smaller off white head. Aromas and tastes of malts, fruits and spices. Nutmeg the stronger spice with cinnamon. The body was a little thin. Tasted on 11/20 (the 2nd runnings tastings). Cinnamon definitely stronger this time around. 8% very well hidden. My ratings on my notes were close enough that Iâ€™m not changing it...
Copper Crow Holiday Cheer;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Copper Crow Beer Company;Spices galore in this one. Unlike many spiced holiday brews that taste like a lager with pumpkin spice thrown in, this beer all the spices compliment and blend perfectly. Nice light malt, and the cinnamon finish lingers well after the glass is empty.

Decent honey and fruity malt aroma, a bit dusty. Unfortunately, flavor didnâ€™t follow it, it was still sweet malty, but far from elegant with very pronounced metallic note. Some hops, but only a little bit. Medium to thinner body with shorter, a bit papery and honey finish. Wouldnâ€™t be so bad without these unpleasant components, but this way is far from a decent Bohemian pils, not even mentioning too few hops.

Wojak Jasny PeÅ‚ny 6%;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);500ml can (24hr store, Warsaw) - Online Shitty Beer Night 2 WTF? - brussel sprouts! And some hits of perfume. 2 Pale ,brief head 2 Utterly vile retronasals. I just canâ€™t describe half of them, but later I get recognisable enemies like chalk and old dishcloth. Taste does hint towards having some yeast-induced esters, but they come over as unpleasantly chemical and industrial. OK, thatâ€™s mold in the retronasals, Iâ€™ve got it now. And thatâ€™s spring onions in the taste - nice! (not) 1 Typical strong lager body, carbonated sweet water. Rough as fuck. Acidic. Post-vomit levels in fact. 3 I hate myself. But at least I can piss away the guilt in the morning.
Wojak Jasny PeÅ‚ny 6%;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Bottle. Pours clear light golden with airy white head. Clear aroma of grass and booze. Watery, slightly bitter taste with no remarkable finish. Just boring.
Wojak Jasny PeÅ‚ny 6%;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);"50cl bottle from a Polish shop in Andover. Pale straw with a thick white head; the aroma has some faint grassy hops and some sweet cereal grains; the flavour is surprisingly fruity, unmistakeably pineapple, and rather full bodied, although soapy; the finish has some warmth from the alcohol, and is rather sticky from the sweet fruit; but overall this is a pleasant surprise."
Wojak Jasny PeÅ‚ny 6%;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Lightly watered taste of bitterness. Some weird sour and hoppy nutes in palate. White foam, disappearing very fast. Golden colour. Not too good beer

Bitter End Razmataz;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"This is supposed to be a raspberry version of their Wits End. Hazy reddish yellow. Very sharp raspberry/alcohol aroma, almost a little whiskeylike. Crisp, slightly effervescent, with raspberry turning into wheat as you go from aroma to beginning to finish. Seems to be a very inspired beer; the raspberry and wheat go together quite well. The amount of raspberry perfectly asserts its presence without degrading any of the beer qualities. I can see how this would be a hit-or-miss, but it was definitely a hit with me."
Goose Island Sahti;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Gotlandsdricke/ KoduÃµlu/ Sahti;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);[Tap] Golden colored pour with some haze to it. A small white head on top. Nose is of crisp and spicy malt alongside floral hops. Rye bread, pale malts and fleeting hints of juniper berries round out the taste. Prickly carbonation. Could have used more juniper actually. Tasting notes from 12/2011.
Goose Island Sahti;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Gotlandsdricke/ KoduÃµlu/ Sahti;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at the brewpub... Pours a completely transparent amber brown hue , homogenous throughout, and topped with a thin wispy soapy barely off-white head... Aroma of fruity pears and banana yeasty esthers. Fairly subdued on the spice front actually and was expecting more in that regard... Dark and mild fruits throughout, generally sweet with caramels and soft grain that gives it some texture. A touch more than full in body with decent level of lively carbonation. Lacking some complexity and spice nature that usually is offered up by the style.
Goose Island Sahti;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Gotlandsdricke/ KoduÃµlu/ Sahti;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);December 28, 2011, tap at Clybourn. Translucent copper with minimal head. Aroma was fruity, spicy and maybe some rye. Taste was similar, slight carbonation but very east to drink.
Goose Island Sahti;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Gotlandsdricke/ KoduÃµlu/ Sahti;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Pours hazy yellow with notes of fruit and dried tea leaves. The flavor shows off some lighter malts with a bit of the rye near the end of the finish.
Goose Island Sahti;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Gotlandsdricke/ KoduÃµlu/ Sahti;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft on tap at the brewpub (Chicago, IL). Pours a glowing golden pour, light haze, small offwhite frothy head laces small, dies into a film. Aromas are light pine, touches of sweet toffee, caramel, bready malts. Some tea, light florals, some light grass. Initial is lighter bodied, touches of piney bitterness move into sweet bready malts, juniper berries, light bitterness, touches of honey and toffee, light bodied overall, easily quaffable. Quite clean, a backend that busts some ass with sweet honey, wet bread, and some piney juniper. Light overall, easily drinkable. The pine fades out a bit much for my liking, sweet rye and oats with a touch of toastiness. Bitter pine tries itâ€™s best to balance, but canâ€™t. A sweeter beer, ok overall. Interesting.
Goose Island Sahti;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Gotlandsdricke/ KoduÃµlu/ Sahti;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);In tap at GI into a tasting glass, recommendation by the bar tender...Pours a yellowish gold, pretty clear, watery lacing...The aroma is pretty good, a nice mixture of fruit and tea. Tea does dominate mostly but the pears and lemon help to balance this a little...The balance on the nose is undone the taste as its mostly tea with aloe and other herbal notes. Still some fruity notes just not enough. To much tea for me to make it drinkable. What some would find refreshing I find as medicinal.
Goose Island Sahti;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Gotlandsdricke/ KoduÃµlu/ Sahti;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draught at Wrigleyville BrewPub: Aroma of malt caramel, light rye, and a hint of juniper.

Average carbonation. Medium sweet, malt slight rye, and slight candi sugar finish. Not all that much flavor.
Goose Island Sahti;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Gotlandsdricke/ KoduÃµlu/ Sahti;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);draft at clybourn brewpub. aroma is pale malts, undefined spice, sand, big florals. appearance is lightly caramelized brown, crystal clear, super polished. flavor is sweet malty, light herbs, big floral fresh nectar, big sandy flavor returns. mouthfeel is mealy, lightly gritty. quite complex but difficult to imagine even a second glass of this.
Goose Island Sahti;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Gotlandsdricke/ KoduÃµlu/ Sahti;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at clybourn brewpub. Weak pleasant grainy aroma.

Goose Island Sahti;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Gotlandsdricke/ KoduÃµlu/ Sahti;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at the brewpub. Pours a golden brown with a small white froth. Aroma is surprisingly basic, mostly just a soft candy caramel malt and some light fruity and floral notes. Just very simple, a touch of bread and biscuit. Flavor starts with some basic bready sweet notes before a slightly stronger floral and citrusy fruit notes. Finishes lightly bitter and sweet with some doughy notes. Medium body and a softer carbonation. Eh, kinda boring, nothing standing out here.
Goose Island Preemptive Strike;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft: Sticky frothed tan foam. Beautiful porter aroma of abundant hop character, caramel, cappuccino, cocoa, concord grape, light smoke, blackberry, and a hint of licorice. Soft and powdery palate. The wonderful flavors show huge roastiness, lots of coffee and cocoa, and a touch of charred malt. Finishes chewy and bitterly hoppy. A mild mannered, yet extremely impressive and tasteful rendition.

Light malt and hops aroma. Slight fruityness, light malts, very slight bitterness, hint of citrus. Light body, well carbonated, slightly malty finish.

(rating 4000) Clear golden with a small fluffy white head. Aroma of grass, some bread, caramel and light notes of butter. Similar taste.

SkÃ¥nsk Klassiker;Tomelilla, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;TvÃ¥ Bryggare / Ã–sterlenbryggarna / Bryggeriet i Ystad;Bottle. Cloudy and boring to look at. IÂ´ve seen more action in fruit juice, than in this beer. With only a few bubbles this beer is as dull as Bush, and IÂ´m not referring to the beer! Aroma is...not bad, but really not very interesting either. Mouthfeel is acceptable, but the tart aftertaste doesnÂ´t get me at all, and I usually get quite a kick of out beer with some sourness in them. I expected more out of this beer, particularly knowing what other swedish microbreweries are able to deliver. Maybe this requires 5-10 bottles in a row, before IÂ´ll grow into it, but thatÂ´s not likely to happen.
SkÃ¥nsk Klassiker;Tomelilla, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;TvÃ¥ Bryggare / Ã–sterlenbryggarna / Bryggeriet i Ystad;A hazy yellow beer with a huge white head. The aroma is sweet brewmashy combined with slight hints of hops. The flavor is lemony and hoppy with a slight touch of malt, and a dry lemony end. Somewhat like drinking lemonade.
Cardinal Sans Alcool;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;FeldschlÃ¶sschen (Carlsberg);Light golden blond coloured beer with average carbonation and a medium white head. Rather sweet hoppy aroma with light grainy touches. medium palate. Finish is light watttery, sweet grainy hints. Rather typical low-alcohol brew. Nothing special

Cerveceria BodegÃ³n Blanca;El Chalten, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;El BodegÃ³n Cerveza Artesanal;Sampled at the brewpub . A nice brew. Pretty sweet and citrus. Probably an appropriate mixing given their location but I was hoping for a bit more.
Cerveceria BodegÃ³n Blanca;El Chalten, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;El BodegÃ³n Cerveza Artesanal;Horrid acidic tropical fruit aroma. Taste of papaya, and water, over hopped, with a gnarly bitterness that sits in the back of your throat like a retch. No body, no bubbles, yet served with a huge detergent like head.
Whirra Rubia;El Calafate, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Whirra;Light golden pils with a thick creamy white head. Wet dough aroma. In mouth, light bodid, with a light biscuitty malt and a bit too much herbal hops. Unbalanced. Not overly bad. On tap May 2006.
Whirra Rubia;El Calafate, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Whirra;Over-carbed, just like the ''Negra''. Unusual tutti-frutti aroma. Over hopped with cascades, but still had a nice biscuity malt flavour and a decent body.
Whirra Negra;El Calafate, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Cerveceria Whirra;Dark black beer with a lacing thick moka head. Light sulfuric dough aroma. In moputh, light chocolate with roasted coffee notes, and light bodied. The best of the 3 offerings. On tap May 2006.
Whirra Negra;El Calafate, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Cerveceria Whirra;Okay, firstly this is not negra (black) by any stretch of the imagination. The brewer uses 10% roast malt, to create something barely even pale amber in colour. I think he should think about giving it a name change. Secondly, it was really poorly presented, over carbed in a huge way, it was about 25% head, despite his rather elaborate 2 mug and spatula pouring technique. However, all that aside, it tasted really nice, heaps of caramel malt flavours, smokey and toasty with a nice hop balance.
Thwaites Good Elf (4.9%) (Cask);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;Dark mahogany with no head, this beer was poured very poorly by a young slip of a lass in a pub in Hammersmith, London on Boxing day evening 2006. Christmas cake/pudding spices attacked my nose, along with sweet malts, very interesting. The aroma carried on into the taste, a thicker mouthfeel than I was expecting from a mild, almost rich. A very nice mild, one I will have again if our paths cross.
Thwaites Good Elf (4.9%) (Cask);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;Mild bitterness, good fruits, full of taste and almost a full bodied real ale.

Thwaites Good Elf (4.9%) (Cask);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. Dark red brown with a small beige head. Very little aroma I could perceive beyond a touch of pencil shavings. Taste was delicious: sweet liquorice, nuts and and spiced fruits. A little bitterness. Very nice.
Thwaites Good Elf (4.9%) (Cask);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;Cask (JDW Pub in London) - Dark brown with red tings. Fruity aroma with malt and raisins. Fruity taste with a sweet and hoppy element with raisins, toffee and some spicy malt notes.

Strong bready malt aroma with a hint of coca cola. Similar flavour with hints of nuts and caramel in the finish. A little better than I expected to be honest.
Thwaites Good Elf (4.9%) (Cask);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;Handpulled cask at Baker St. Spoons. Red/brown with off white head. Malty with caramel and a dusty hop finish. Nothing special.
Thwaites Good Elf (4.9%) (Cask);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;"[Cask at the Old Manor &#40;JDW&#41;, Bracknell.] Tawny brown with a ruby tint and a dense cream head; caramel and treacle aroma; smooth caramel body, rather dry to start, then some roast hazelnuts come through before a warming sweet tracel finish. A very pleasing winter ale."
Thwaites Good Elf (4.9%) (Cask);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;Fruity malts, backed with some nuttyness and floural hops. Taste is similar, toast coming through sort of missing a bit of character for this % of ale, and not really what id call a mild.
Glaistig;Lago Puelo, Argentina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Glaistig;The celtic design on the bottle looked great, but as soon as I opened the bottle and this murky orange stuff spewed forth I reduced my expectations. Over carbonated, rather grim aroma, of bland hops and hessian sacks. Cidery flavour dissappears quickly, in a flurry of bubbles, leaving a minimal sweet aftertaste.
Blest Fruto Prohibido Cider;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Apple Cider;Cerveceria Blest;Lightly hazed cider, bubbly and sweet. In mouth, tastes like Allenâ€™s Nectar (our own Quebec soft drink, a fizzy apple juice), a bit too sweet and overcarbonated. Aroma improves as cider warms up, with nice malic notes, like green apples. On tap, May 2006.
Blest Fruto Prohibido Cider;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Apple Cider;Cerveceria Blest;Clear, full apple flavour, mildly sweet, low carbonation. No unwelcome fermentation flavours, could be a little drier though.

Blest Pilsen;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Blest;Draught at the brewpub, a hazy bright yellow gold with a thick foamy head. A lemony citrus hop aroma. A very clean hoppy palate, not too bitter and not too crisp. Lemon again in the flavour with grainy malt characaters.
Blest Pilsen;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Blest;Bottled, thanks Fukito! Pale golden, rich head. Grassy, buttery nose. Medium sweet and medium bodied. Solidly malty, yet with soft mouthfeel. Lightly buttery and fairly hoppy, finishes with good bitterness. A well made rounded hoppy lager beer.
Blest Pilsen;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Blest;Drank this one at Cerveceria Blest in Bariloche. Apart from this being an awesome location, the beer is excellent. It is called Rubia overthere and is one of the better pilseners I know. Rather bitter but very pleasing.
Blest Pilsen;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Blest;Hazy golden body with a thin, diminishing white head. Some mild Saaz hop aroma with nice earthy bitterness and plenty of biscuity malt to provide sweetness. Light tropical fruit as well. Some bandaid type aromas that definitely seems off, but luckily itâ€™s not too strong. The body is light and crisp on the tongue, relatively satisfying. The flavor is mostly sweet with the malt and fruitiness really coming out. The hops are evident, but not too strong and certainly donâ€™t provide enough bitterness for the style. OK, and not exactly good.
Blest Pilsen;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Blest;Blonde pils with a thin lacing white head. Light caramel aroma, with berry notes. Nice crisp malt in mouth, smooth, lightly hopped. Not bad and very fresh. On tap, May 2006.
Blest Pilsen;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Blest;"On draught at Pilgrim Bar. A hazy straw color with slight head and noticable diacetyl aroma and flavor. Light/medium body with slight early hop bitterness, mellow light malt flavor and citrusy character. Could be a victim of poor handling in distribution. A ""pilsner""?"
Blest Pilsen;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Blest;"Bottle - July 2005 Pours lively golden with a not so-long lasting white head. The colour is beatifull, although not ""cristal clear"" enough for a pilsner. Aroma is dry and malty, right online with the style. Taste is bitter, but somewhat sweet, gentle, pleasant. I donÂ´t know why the other ratings where so low, i really like pilsners and i found this one to be smooth. I could sense some slightly sulphur, but not enough to say ""rotten egs"""
Blest Pilsen;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cerveceria Blest;A strange liquid. Bad named like a Pilsen style . Brewed from the wrong hop for a pilsen (Cascade!!!.) Very fruity, cloudy smell bad (rotten eggs). Another waste of time in Argentina Breweries. I dont try the others styles

Blest Bock;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cerveceria Blest;Smell has a bit of a roasted barley but the taste only follows through a little bit. There is a little sourness, but not as much as somedarker beers around Bariloche. This oneâ€™s not bad, just average. Had a bottle from the store in Bariloche.
Blest Bock;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cerveceria Blest;Draught at the brewpub, dark brown with a tan foamy head. Light roasted malt aroma. A very nice roasted malt palate with coffee flavour in abundance. Nicely done.
Blest Bock;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cerveceria Blest;Bottle at Cossab, BsAs - Sadly this bottle had some infection but I could still taste the good rich chocolatey body underneath with some sweetness and a long, malty, cocoa-laced finish. Not as good as it could have been but certainly has potential.
Blest Bock;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cerveceria Blest;Drank this one at Cerveceria Blest in Bariloche. Apart from this being an awesome location, the beer is excellent. This negra (as it is called there) is a very rewarding beer, not sweet, good body, and refreshing.
Blest Bock;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cerveceria Blest;Dark burgundy with a thin, tan head. The aroma is malty and sweet, full of brown sugar, caramel and a light fruitiness. The nose on this is really nice. Fairly full body with nice development on the tongue. The flavor is on the sweet side, but not inherently sweet on its own. Nice malts and a hint of bitterness at the finish. Easily the best beer from this brewery, at least in my experience.
Blest Bock;San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cerveceria Blest;Bottled, thanks Fukito! Dark mahogany with firm off-white head. Aroma mostly of caramelized sugar. Fairly sweet with evident caramel flavour. Medium bodied with soft mouthfeel. Thankfully the flavour of crystalized sugar does not carry over into sticky sweetness, so the beer reminds gentle and drinkable. Mildly herbal finish.

Gahan Sydney Street Stout;Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada;Stout;Prince Edward Island Brewing Company (The Gahan House);While vacationing on PEI I went to the Gahan House in Charlottetown where I had this on tap.

Gahan Sydney Street Stout;Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada;Stout;Prince Edward Island Brewing Company (The Gahan House);2016/09/14 - Pours black with a frothy, khaki head that slowly reduces and leaves minimal patchy lacing. Aroma is roasted coffee, smoky notes, light chocolate, toasted cereal and a hint of licorice. Taste is lots of toasted bread with some coffee roast and hints of semi sweet chocolate. Mouthfeel is light to medium and silky with smooth carbonation and a moderately dry, bittersweet finish. Not too shabby. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Gahan Sydney Street Stout;Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada;Stout;Prince Edward Island Brewing Company (The Gahan House);On tap at the brewer pub in Halifax. This is a very dark and rich stout with loads of dark roasted malts, a touch of char, and more smoke. The Smokey/burnt aspects, however, are not overdone, instead working well with over flavors of the dark grain load. Medium body with light carbonation.

Gahan Sydney Street Stout;Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada;Stout;Prince Edward Island Brewing Company (The Gahan House);500ml bottle bought by parents in pei and shared with father in law. Aroma: caramel, chocolate, coffee that burned on the bottom of the coffee pot. App: pitch black with medium frothy moka head and some good lacing. Taste and palate: full body, creamy, mineral and bitter finish. Overall: that mineral feeling is quite unpleasant, same for the burned coffee. Glad I shared it. Maybe still too cold too.
Gahan Sydney Street Stout;Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada;Stout;Prince Edward Island Brewing Company (The Gahan House);Nostalgia and bias are ringing true here. Iâ€™m from PEI and have always stated (but apparently have never rated) that this is my favourite beer of all time. Now on to the rating. 500 ml bottle poured at home. Pours black with a tan head that dies quickly. Smells like smoke and a touch of coffee. Tastes like the same: smoke and coffee. While my opinion of this beer has changed over time slightly (more smoke, less coffee than my first impressions), I still love it.

Gahan Harvest Time Golden Lager;Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Prince Edward Island Brewing Company (The Gahan House);On tap at Gahan - on tap at Gahan - deep gold appearance, has a salty aroma and a buttery taste. Drinkable but nothing special.
Gahan Harvest Time Golden Lager;Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Prince Edward Island Brewing Company (The Gahan House);Probably one of Gahanâ€™s better light beers and even a good lager in its own right. Pours a bubbly gold with a small head. Aroma is of cereal, spice, and tropical hops. Tastes of cereal, caramel, herbs, and lemon. Has a light body with high carbonation that is tingly to the tongue. This is a very good refreshing lager. Earlier Rating: 5/22/2014 Total Score: 1.7 A pretty watery brew. Smells of light hay and cereal. The taste is a vague cereal hay combo, with a touch of spice. Has a light sweet body, with a watery mouth feel. I do not notice any hops in this, perhaps to subtle. One of the least popular of their offerings now doubt
Gahan Harvest Time Golden Lager;Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Prince Edward Island Brewing Company (The Gahan House);Wayyyyyyyy better than all of their other light beers. A really nice, clean and actually golden colour with a thin white head. Smells is pretty fine, sweet corn, tropical fruits and sweet floral hops, some buttery smells too. Taste is a bit vinous, sweet with some of those buttery notes and some tropical, mellow hops. Sort of a cloying sweetness and oily feel for a lager and something not off but odd about the taste. I would have pegged this as a summer session brew instead. Much better than all of the goofy fruit beers they have been doing. Earlier Rating: 5/26/2014 Total Score: 1.8 Just stop. Please. Is there not enough similar beers from this brewery? I donâ€™t see the need. Make one of the similar beers decent and move on. Itâ€™s watery, light cereal and hay flavours with a hop-be-gone spell cast upon it. It looks better than it tastes.
Gahan Harvest Time Golden Lager;Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Prince Edward Island Brewing Company (The Gahan House);Orange golden pour with a very thin lace.

Gahan Harvest Time Golden Lager;Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Prince Edward Island Brewing Company (The Gahan House);"Pint draft @ Gahan. Deep, clear gold, moderate white head. Grainy aroma. Taste is not much to start, then big cereal, with a mild bitterness on the finish. Body was a little watery. Overall, I feel like Iâ€™ve been bait-and-switched a little. Name is ""Harvest"" but it seems to not be seasonal. It is called a pale ale in the description but it is clearly not an EPA or APA. For a blonde or golden it was decent; I kind of like grainy tasting lighter beers and the finish worked, but I feel like this needs to be rebranded."
El Bolson Extra Negra XXX;El Bolson, Argentina;Bock - Doppelbock;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Strong taste of alcohol. Not as good as the Negra extra in my opinion. A sweet taste that stays with you all the way through. Sweet and a little bit sour at the leave. Had on tap at the Bolson beer garden in El Bolson town center.
El Bolson Extra Negra XXX;El Bolson, Argentina;Bock - Doppelbock;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottled. A dark brown beer with a beige head. Aroma is sweet , roasted and coffee. Taste is malty and sweet, notes of brown sugar and caramel. Not as full body as I would expect for a doppelbock.
El Bolson Extra Negra XXX;El Bolson, Argentina;Bock - Doppelbock;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottled. brown to Black, no head. Sweet caramel with coffee aroma. The malty caramel is hiding the alcohol well othervise is the taste strangeand is definetly lacking some bitterness.
El Bolson Extra Negra XXX;El Bolson, Argentina;Bock - Doppelbock;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Poured a hazy brown color with a beige head. The aroma is of tart coffee, plums, butterscotch and alcohol. The flavor is tart with plums, figs and cola.
El Bolson Extra Negra XXX;El Bolson, Argentina;Bock - Doppelbock;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle shared by maxxdaddy. Brown cloudy appearance. Aroma is loaded with cold coffee, dark toasted grain and a bit of chocolate. Strange buttery/butterscotch aroma that comes and goes depending on whether you swirl or not. Flavour is slightly sour but it has an unusual sweetness with lots of coffeeish character. A bit of brown sugar and molasses, but again, a vegetal cold coffee flavour. Itâ€™s not great, but itâ€™s a hell of a lot better than itâ€™s paler brother.
El Bolson Extra Negra XXX;El Bolson, Argentina;Bock - Doppelbock;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Super toasty aroma, like really toast, more than any beer Iâ€™ve other had. When you swirl this you get a bit of sourness that probably shouldnâ€™t be there. An odd sweetness/sourness in the flavor, behind some espresso and more toast. A little off and odd, though the aroma is quite good. Could be better if it wasnâ€™t likely infected.
El Bolson Extra Negra XXX;El Bolson, Argentina;Bock - Doppelbock;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle in Buenos Aires in December 2007. A dark brown to black color with a brown head.

Newby Wyke The Deep;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Porter;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask, Leicester Fest â€™08 (Thurs afternoon session). The 4th highest rated on the bill. Not that I make obsessive lists of such things. Lacy beige on pitch, tinted with ruby. Scorched leather, heady grain, burnt xmas pudding. Canâ€™t see how this can be listed as anything other than a Stout. Cocoa and Marmite touches, a bit too much alcohol. Smoky, smooth, powerful, and a bit fruity. Dry, roasty and attenuated, but nothing special.
Newby Wyke The Deep;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Porter;Newby Wyke Brewery;Sampled from cask (gravity dispense) at 6th Chelmsford Winter Beer Festival 2005. Pitch black, small head. Mostly sweet mild malty aroma with chocolate tones. Roasted malt and dry hop in the flavor. Coffee notes and a good long burned finish. I like it.
Newby Wyke The Deep;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Porter;Newby Wyke Brewery;Newby Wyke tends to concentrate on pale coloured ales but this beer certainly shows they can make damn fine dark stuff as well. OK, itâ€™s one of those beers that hovers between styles, as others have observed, but letâ€™s not worry about that. Very deep colour - almost black, although thereâ€™s a hint of brown when held up to the light. The emphasis is on espresso coffee, dark chocolate and licorice. Coffee certainly dominates the aroma, but the other elements come into play more in the flavour. Roasted malt and some dry bitterness provide good balance. The consistency is slightly oily. And thereâ€™s enough alcohol to provide a bit of a kick. If thereâ€™s any criticism itâ€™s that the flavours fall away slightly on the finish and the mouthfeel is not the biggest, but those are just minor quibbles. A very good beer as long as you donâ€™t approach it expecting a rich stout. Cask (gravity dispense), Chelmsford Winter Beer Festival.
Newby Wyke The Deep;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Porter;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask at Chelmsford Winter BeerEx. Gravity in good condition. Black with white head. Lives up to its name, this is like a black hole. Not sure if this is a porter more like an old ale but very good all the same, similar to Dark Star which I had after this.
Newby Wyke The Deep;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Porter;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Market Porter, Borough, London . Black with a speckled brown head. Thin looking but as you approached the generous aroma was undeniable. Rich, dry, dark chocolate aroma and flavour. Nothing opulent about this one, just shear honest passion for beer. Another lovely beer from Wykes, although at the time of consumption I didnâ€™t know either of the beers were Wykes.
Newby Wyke The Deep;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Porter;Newby Wyke Brewery;This is as dark as the depths of the ocean. To be honest I'm not sure if this is a porter or stout. I stand corrected if I'm wrong. Anyhow - this is a hell of a smooth chocolate and coffee tasting beer. The light bitterness suits it perfectly. VERY smooth. Mmmm.
Newby Wyke Bitter;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Star Inn, Huddersfield 26/07/2003 Golden coloured and hoppy with some citrus aroma. Lasting finish.
Newby Wyke Bitter;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Newby Wyke Brewery;Dark amber with a small beige head. Aromas are gooseberry, spicy hops, yeast and fruit.

Barnsley Black Heart;Blackpool, Lancashire, Lancashire, England;Stout;Blackpool;Cask Handpump at Wilkieâ€™s Tavern, Warrington 18/07/2004 Black stout which is smooth on the palate. Slightly dry pleasant roast malt finish.
Barnsley Black Heart;Blackpool, Lancashire, Lancashire, England;Stout;Blackpool;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Dark brown with a thin tan head. Unexpectedly lovely. More like an old style, Dave suggests its actually a porter despite the pub-clips claim to being a stout. F-ing lovely in any case.
Barnsley Black Heart;Blackpool, Lancashire, Lancashire, England;Stout;Blackpool;Very dark, with smoky & chocolatey hints. More bitterness than many stouts. Dry finish. Very drinkable. Unfortunately, the brewery seems to have gone bust for the umpteenth time and, whilst the beers may still be available, they are brewed by Blackpool brewery. Draught on handpump, The Speaker, London SW1, March 2003
Great Lakes Wolfhound Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);pitch black with thick white head. nitrogenated. firm bitterness from roasted malt. some fruitiness from the esters. no real hop flavor. very nice version of the style
Great Lakes Wolfhound Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On tap at the brewery pours black with tan head. Aroma is mainly malt and coffee. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor is dark roasted malts, with a touch of coffee and finishes dry. This is an easy drinking stout and Iâ€™m glad this one makes it tap often.
Great Lakes Wolfhound Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On tap at GLBC. Darkest brown/black pour with a huge creamy tan head. Dry malt and coffee aroma that is faint at first (frigginâ€™ nitros!), but comes out more as the beer warms. Creamy malty flavor up front with a bitter coffee finish. Flavor is also more pronounced as the beer warms. Pretty darn good for a nitro stout.
Great Lakes Wolfhound Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On draft at the brewpub. To me, this is about as fine an example of a dry stout as one can expect. I believe this is my first 5 for appearance. It was just so sumptuous looking - opaque, thick, oily, with a perfect inch of cafe au lait head sitting contentedly on top of the brew. Strong but not overpowering roasted barley in the nose. And the taste lasted forever, with the roasts coming in initially but rounded by a nicely complex malt flavor, thick and chewy oatmeal, and a superbly creamy mouthfeel. Truly enjoyable.
Great Lakes Wolfhound Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"Date: 07/23/2007 Mode: Draft Source: Brewpub black, thin fine beige head, dry roasted malt aroma, creamy oily oatmeal body, lots of roasted flavor, well tempered bitterness considering the amount of roasted malts, Aroma: 6/10; Appearance: 7/10; Flavor: 6/10; Palate: 8/10; Overall: 12/20 Rating: 3.2/5.0 Drinkability: 8/10 Score: **/4"
Great Lakes Wolfhound Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On tap at the brewery. Always worth the trip. The pour is a deep black with a nearly white frothy head. Looks much like a Guiness. The aroma is of deep roasted malts with a hint of sweat coffee. The flavor is not at all like a Guiness, the malts are stronger and the flavor of coffee is fairly pronounced though out the tasting. The finish is quickly, but the malt leaves a bit of an aftertaste. Very good stout. Very good.
Great Lakes Wolfhound Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);on Tap @ GLBC, black beer, looks like guinness, tastes a hell of a lot better... nice smooth mouthfeel perfect for a dry stout, roasty flavors that was great. Really enjoyed trying this one
Great Lakes Wolfhound Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Black pour, great almond nitro head. Roasted malts in the aroma. Flavors are roasted malts all the way, chocolate, some coffee, almost smokiness to it, maybe some oats in the silky mouthfeel. Dry but not too dry because of the great mouthfeel form the nitro and even lightly hopped. This beer was perfect for itâ€™s style.
Great Lakes Wolfhound Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Served with nitrogen. Black with a tan head. Aroma and flavor both have a roast coffee presence, along with dark chocolate. Dry finish.
Great Lakes Wolfhound Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);This beer is very black with a very nice tan head. The aroma and taste have a lot of roast, and a bit of chocolate coffe in them. The body is thicker than the other stouts GLBC makes, and the finish is a nice lasting bitter flavor. But overall I think it is the weakest of the GLBC stouts. Also the alcohol content is lower than expected.
Macknade Fine Foods;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ales of Kent Brewery;Specially brewed by Ales of Kent for the Macknade Farm shop near Faversham. The Macknade shop is a good outlet for the craft brewers of Kent. This is a pale gold bitter with a short lived and sizzling head. A fluffy malt body like bread dough with a nice tangerine tang.

Nose is pure vegetables in the worst fashion, DMS, just pure awful cooked vegetables. Taste is sparkling, thin, watery, overly metallic, awfully mineral tasting with cooked vegetables. Thin, metallic, watery. Rubbish. Burkina Faso appears to be another poor country where the beer scene is dominated by a western industrial brewery churning out garbage.

Sweet malty and slightly grainy aroma with a faint note of honey and delicate herbal hoppy note. Sweet-bitter flavour, light to medium bodied with a soft carbonation. Initially soft malty, slightly strawy and grainy taste with herbal accents, getting slightly stronger towards the moderately dry and bitter finish. Boring but drinkable Pils (18.06.08).
GÃ¶ttinger Edel-Pils;Einbeck, Lower Saxony, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Einbecker Brauhaus;Bottle in GÃ¶ttingen. Nice crisp pilsener, not overwhelming but worth drinking. Clean fresh taste. Canâ€™t comment on appearance because I drank it from the bottle (when in Germany...).

Better than many similar local beers.

John Harvard's Cambridge Demon DPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;Newbie. Had this one while on a bar tour. Needless to say, it was the only drink at that bar (John Harvardâ€™s in Cambridge). I liked it but it was too strong to enjoy on a bar tour :)
John Harvard's Cambridge Demon DPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;I drank this beer in Boston, at the original John Harvardâ€™s Brewery in Cambridge. It has a reddish-copper color with a medium-sized head. The flavor of hops is powerful and delicious, especially being double-hopped. This beer is delicious, especially if you like IPAs.
John Harvard's Cambridge Demon DPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;On tap in Harvard Square. Very hoppy aroma. Dark amber color. Piney hop taste. Can definitely taste the alchohol but doesnâ€™t overpower. Slightly medicinal though. Pretty good for its class but i have had better. I would order it again though.
John Harvard's Cambridge Demon DPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;On tap at the brewpub. Nice chewy hop nose in pine resin and citrus rind. Soft and waxy. Lazy. Pours a deepened orange, with a silky, white lace above. Flavor is fresh dense and chewy. Quite a douple pale and not just an IPA. Hops work balanced and in harmony with the malt. Very bready, chewy and with some yeast. A nice malt profile for the beer. Hops a mish-mash of warm citrus and pine. A bit of grassiness. Nicely balanced. Fresh and bubbly. Alcohol is warming, but only adds complexity. Finishes on a long mandarin draw.

John Harvard's Cambridge Demon DPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;Tap at Boston EBF 2007. Cloudy golden body topped by an off-white ring. Balance clearly leaning towards the hops. Light roasted malt flavour dominated by substantial amount of hops with a taste lying somewhere between citrus fruits and pine-tree. Above average and very pleasant Pale Ale on steroids. Recommended to hopheads. I now do reverse exorcism, I help people who possess a Demon get rid of it.

John Harvard's Cambridge Demon DPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;22 oz bottle from Weeare. Thanks Mike. Pours a light hazy amber with a thin lasting head. Aroma is of solvents and pineapple, mango and other tropical fruits- amarillo and simcoe? Light citrusy flavor with some pine, and cedary notes. Light crystal malt backgrounnd and a lighter than expeceted bitterness for an 8% hoppy beer. Smooth and tasty finish.
John Harvard's Cambridge Demon DPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;"Thanks to warriorsoul for this! Appears a transparent, golden amber with a small, 1/2"" creamy, off-white head that doesnâ€™t want to fade out. Lots of streaky, spotty lacing is left around the glass. Smell is of citrus, pine, light caramel, toasted malts, and toffee. Taste is of a bitter, balanced version of the mentioned aromas with a caramel, & toffee flavor highlighted in the mix. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, along with a slightly dulled grapefruit hoppiness and yeast resounding on the back of the tongue during the swallow."
John Harvard's Cambridge Demon DPA;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;22oz bottle shared courtesy of weeare138 (thanks!).

Sockeye Dagger Falls IPA;Boise, Idaho, United States;IPA;Sockeye Brewing;12 oz can poured into a pint glass. A well balanced IPA that serves the purpose.

Sockeye Sikama Imperial Stout;Boise, Idaho, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sockeye Brewing;Special Edition brew, they ran out of porter tonight and substituted this. Made me happy, this was very tasty. Picture Old Rasputin Imperial Stout with 7.5% ABV, and that's what this would be. Very smooth palate with a mild, yet very refreshing flavor. Coffee and chocolate malts are detectable and it goes down very smooth. Overall a very good beer I really enjoyed.

OÅ¾ujsko Izzy;Zagreb, Croatia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;ZagrebaÄka Pivovara (Molson Coors);I remember this one from my childhood. Mile drank 10 bottles at Evaâ€™s 18â€™th birthday in 2005. It was supposed to be a Croatian version of Corona. What a fail! Very light and tasteless.
OÅ¾ujsko Izzy;Zagreb, Croatia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;ZagrebaÄka Pivovara (Molson Coors);This was piss like that Mexican Corona. Smart move they moved it! Like we donâ€™t have enough shit to introduce new, worser beers.

OÅ¾ujsko Izzy;Zagreb, Croatia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;ZagrebaÄka Pivovara (Molson Coors);"Rerate: So, I didnâ€™t rerate it this summer, but, itâ€™s not because I didnâ€™t care to, itâ€™s because itâ€™s very rare on the coast even then. And itâ€™s supposed to be a ""party"" beer. Well, itâ€™s a good thing actually, cos we donâ€™t need more bad beers. Anyway, I found it when I moved to Zagreb. Itâ€™s quite common here (not popular though). To the beer. It poured a pale yellow colour, and it had a medium sized fluffy white head. Extremely (f)izzy (bad pun alert). The nose was... malt and olive oil. Ugly. Taste... a bit better than last time, but still not too good, basically, weak generic malt. Sorted kinds ? No. Maybe some very weak hops thrown in, but not enough to make a difference, or more than a faint ""bleep"" on the taste radar. Oily aftertaste. -1 on palate overall. I was too generous back then. Old Review: When I joined Ratebeer, I kinda ignored this, mostly because I knew that this was not one of the best I could get. So, when I finally decided to go look for this, it was nowhere to be found. The reason ? While itâ€™s not really a summer-only brew as far as I know, they donâ€™t ship it to the coast in the other seasons. Iâ€™m not certain, but itâ€™s possible. Anyway, I decided to go to I store that was a bit out of my way to see what it was carrying, and it had a suprisingly big variety of beers. Unfortunately (for me), Iâ€™ve tried everything they had, and was ready to leave, when I spotted a couple of bottles of this. My ""trip"" was worth it. Or was it ? People say that this is Croatian Corona. And yes, it is. But itâ€™s far better. Itâ€™s still not good. Golden color, white fluffy head, went away fast. Seemed fizzy while in the bottle, but proved not to be. The ""aroma"" was a bit offputting, but bearable. Tastes sweet, a bit hoppy and like of all things, eggs. Bitter aftertaste. Itâ€™s probably an old bottle though. Iâ€™ll rerate it this summer. (2/2/4/3/8)"

DuClaw Ravenwood;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;DuClaw Brewing Company;I had this beer a while back and from what I can remember I enjoyed it. Iâ€™ve had this at the pub/brewery so it was fresh. Nothing special about it is popping into my head at the moment.
DuClaw Ravenwood;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;DuClaw Brewing Company;This beer was the one that got me hooked on Duclaw Brewery in the very beginning I wish they would bring it back!
DuClaw Ravenwood;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;DuClaw Brewing Company;Excellent example of the Kolsch style. Crisp, light, with excellent body and carbonation. Easily my favorite DuClaw offering... And now I understand it is to be discontinued? DuClaw brewers need to re-think that decision. There is no better example of the style available--bottle or tap--in Maryland.
DuClaw Ravenwood;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;DuClaw Brewing Company;On tap at Arundel Mills/Hanover brewpub. A good beer, very pale, light on flavor and body. But provides a nice cleansing sensation and overall refreshing ambience to a meal.
DuClaw Ravenwood;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;DuClaw Brewing Company;On tap at Duclaw, Bowie, Md. location. Poured out a very light golden yellow color, almost clear. Thin white head faded all too quickly. Aromas are of fresh malts, yeasty bread, and sweet hay. Tastes are of a bland nature, with malts and yeast making up the bulk of the flavors. Subdued hops, both in flavors & aromas. Decent beer, but kind of thin bodied for my liking.
DuClaw Ravenwood;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;DuClaw Brewing Company;Clear, bright appearance, nice lacy head. Slightly fruity nose, tart flavor. Very refreshing. My first experience with a real Kolsch, and I was very pleased with how refreshing this beer was.

DuClaw Ravenwood;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;DuClaw Brewing Company;"Clear, pale color; small head with decent lacing.

DuClaw Ravenwood;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;DuClaw Brewing Company;Pale straw, yellowy-gold color. Persistent champagney bubbles. Aroma is mild, difficult to detect. Has some faint, sour yeastiness to it. Definitely has the mild, sour-yeasty character I associate with a kolsch. Pleasant, refreshing flavor. Enjoyable and unobtrusive. Probably would be a good session beer.
TwoRows Scotch Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Dallas. Spicey, alcohol smell. Medium hopped smell and flavor, a little abrasive, but overall, just mild pine, scotch, and nuts. Thick finish.
TwoRows Scotch Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Malt, fruit and alcohol armoa. Medium-dark woody tone that matched the light cherrywood bar rail. Medium heavy sweetness, some alt-like grainy cherry flavor. Finish starts with vanilla and ends up in alchohol and bitterness. Sweet on the lips. ABV made me bump up the overall rating by +1 towards the end.
El Bolson Aji;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Other;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottled. A pale yellow beer with a small white head. Aroma is slightly fruity. Taste is sweet and soft. A strong chili taste in the end. Too strong in my opinion. Light body.
El Bolson Aji;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Other;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle conditioned, hazy amber with a white bubbly head. A sweted fruit aroma. Quite a buttery mouthfeel, flowery at first and it isnâ€™t until the finish that the chilli kick comes through. I surprisingly quite liked this, I thought it might be a little gimmicky.
El Bolson Aji;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Other;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;"Appearance: pale yellow color. Not head. Aroma: chili; and others â€œhot-spiceâ€ like black peppers, seed mustard and red paprika. Very soft smoked. Not hoppy. Flavor: intensive red chilies, hot-spicy, pale malts that adding a soft sweetness. Reminiscences of red paprika, peppers and mustard. Persistent hot taste; some touch of salame very spicy and smoked. I remember the â€œmerkÃ©nâ€, this is a Chilean hot-spice-seasoning of Mapuche people, that contain toasty and dries red-chilies (mainly of ""cacho de cabra"" variety) with salt and others spices like coriander. (Long Live to Chile and Mapuche people!!!). Palate: light body, watery texture. Low carbonation. Very hot-spicy beer, exotic, but the chili-taste is not my favorite. I shared this beer with Panzerfaust"
El Bolson Aji;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Other;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Clear yellow/golden color with a small-fizzy, white fast-diminishing head. It leaves a very small lacing. Aroma is spicy and a little smokey. Notes of chile, pepperoni, smoked ham, salmon, saussages, gherkins and italian salami. Flavor is intense, very hot spicy with lots of chile, pepper, suasages, pepperoni and more spices. Almost no malty sweetness or hop flavors to counterbalance, but really unique. Light to medium body, high stingy carbonation. Finish is very hot and spicy. No alcoholic presence whatsoever. Hot aftertaste. A very different and interesting brew, not for everyone.

El Bolson Aji;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Other;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle. I sware i will not pretend to be a macho man again. Chilli beer is not for me. I think everything that has this kind of vegetables should not be considered as beer.
El Bolson Aji;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Other;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle. Pours a hazy golden color with a longlasting white head. Sweet malty aroma with some hints of chili. Sweet malty flavor. Has some hints of chili. Malty finish with some bitterness and hints of chili.
El Bolson Aji;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Other;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottled. Hazy pale golden, minimal head, contains a small piece of green chili. Tabasco aroma. Initially sweet and rounded, but quickly turning into a burning tabasco sensation. Not as terribly macho as Sunshine Coastâ€™s version, and with more malt to legitimize the chili. A beer that makes you thirst for another beer, but certainbly not another of of the same...
El Bolson Aji;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Other;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Bottle. Light reddish body. Vitually no foam. Light malty flavour with some hint of spices. Nice chili spicy flavour though some what waterish mouthfeel. to it. Bit flat feeling.
El Bolson Aji;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Other;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;Imbibed in December 2002. Not much aroma. Clear light gold color with a head that fizzed and vanished in 30 seconds. Wow! Pretty amazing flavors. Honey/diacetyl flavor with a slight hoppiness that is quickly overwhelmed by peppery, spicy chili zing. Not much heat but lots of chili flavor. Very original and well done. I gave it a high mark because of the flavor and its uniqueness.
El Bolson Aji;El Bolson, Argentina;Flavored - Other;Cerveceria Artesanal El Bolson;I couldn''t really enjoy this beer, but it is exactly what you''d expect. A nice clean lager, pale amber, full head, decent body, and it tastes of chilli, burns the tongue a little. It''s really pretty well executed, I just don''t like the flavour.
Everards Tiger Triple Gold;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Everards;Cask at The White Hart Tap, St. Albans in 2013. Clear copper with a white head. Aroma of caramel, floral hops and a nice peppery hop note. Fairly sweet flavours, but a well served pint.

Everards Tiger Triple Gold;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Everards;Cask at the Columbia press Watford jdw. Aroma is toffee, stale malts, vinegar and cleaning fluid. Mostly clear caramel, amber coloured pour with a fleeting halo of white head. Flavour is sweet caramel and cleaning product citrus, seriously fucked. Some savourly meaty flavours and ammonia. Palate is semi sweet tart, and moderate carbonation. Fucked.
Everards Tiger Triple Gold;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Everards;Tried at the royal hop pole Twekesbury. Deep Amber colour, lasting off white head. Aroma has fruity malt with some hops. Flavour started with malts and finish with a lingering bitterness.

Everards Sleighbell (Cask);Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;23rd Dec 2014: hand-pulled cask pint in The Pheasant, Wellington Shropshire. Mahogany/chestnut body with an off-white crown that produced some good lacing. Malty and semi-sweet with a nutty feel to both the nose and taste.

As Glen correctly noted it is a touch tired perhaps, however it is still quite agreeable. Tangy, fruity and with a few things going on in the mouth, it is fine if somewhat predictable.

Everards Sleighbell (Cask);Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Cask @ Ship, Bromham Road, Bedford. A shade lighter tha chestnut brown. Faint aroma, consisting of caramel and toffee malt notes. Bittersweet. Rather bland, but certainly drinkable.
Everards Sleighbell (Cask);Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Cask at The Wellington, Birmingham. Poured a clear copper colour with a broken white bubbly head. The aroma is malty but weak leading to a medium bitter flavour, with fruity hoppy dry bitter notes. The dry bitterness hits the palate fairly quickly and stays around for a while. Not quite what I would expect from Everards, but very welcome all the same.
Everards Sleighbell (Cask);Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;From the tap. Copper in appearance, christmasy taste with berries, barley overtones. Head is sticky.

Deja Brew Taddy Oatmeal Stout;Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Deja Brew;Dark chestnut. Fizzy tan head. Steady carbonation. Healthy roasted grains and chocolate aroma with notes of barley and oats. Initially a bit watery but modestly malted with a roasted, dry cocoa base and oat smoothness. Dry aftertaste. Medium light body. Flaked barley taste lingers long after, alongside a toasty grain flavor. Powdered cocoa and an astringent roasted property carry through to the end. Finishes solidly flavored and smooth, albeit on the thin side, with an everlasting toasted chocolate covered oatmeal finesse.
Mighty Oak Trick Cyclist;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;"Slightly dark; no head from the cask. A lot more character with the extra alcohol. Good hop bite. Lingers a bit too."

Ahornberger Landbier Hopfig Pils;Konradsreuth, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ahornberger Landbrauerei StrÃ¶ÃŸner-BrÃ¤u;"That will teach me to buy an entire case based simply on those lovely keywords, ""hopfig pils."" In reality itâ€™s not either thing. Itâ€™s a fairly sweet, cakey, flabby, Nilla-wafer-tasting malty helles. Which is fine, really, I can make short work of it when I want to drink a beer and not think about the beer. But I feel misled, nonetheless."
Ahornberger Landbier Hopfig Pils;Konradsreuth, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ahornberger Landbrauerei StrÃ¶ÃŸner-BrÃ¤u;0,5 BÃ¼gel-Flasche aus einem lokalen GetrÃ¤nkemarkt.

Ahornberger Landbier Hopfig Pils;Konradsreuth, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ahornberger Landbrauerei StrÃ¶ÃŸner-BrÃ¤u;Bottle best by March 2015. Clear gold with a fine white head. Quiet pale malt biscuit / cracker aroma with little to no aroma hop expression. Medium body, silty / chalky rough acidity, lightly sweet with medium bitterness. Thereâ€™s some decent malt body but flavor-wise itâ€™s basically empty. Very dull. Faint lemon noble hops mixed with quiet cauliflower DMS.
Ahornberger Landbier Hopfig Pils;Konradsreuth, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ahornberger Landbrauerei StrÃ¶ÃŸner-BrÃ¤u;a bit disappointing - very pale, minimal foam, malty aroma and taste - not bitter at all. iâ€™ve drunk tons of worse lagers, but a lot of better ones too.
Newby Wyke Slipway;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask at the Cambridge Blue, Cambridge on 7th March 2015. Pale gold with thinning off-white foam and pattern lacing. Herby hop aroma with yeastiness. Fruity in-mouth with very pungent medicinal kick, unsure if intended by the brewer. Sharp pungent notes in finish indicative of a yeast infection. Zingy texture and light to moderate body. Will re-rate should I find the beer again.
Newby Wyke Slipway;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask Conditioned Handpump Malt Shovel Northampton. A golden beer with a white rim of head and lacing. A nice citrussy beer both in aroma and taste. Oranges and peaches come through. A bit short in the finish in that it needs more malt but the hops arenâ€™t harsh. Just lacking ooomph. Tasty though.
Newby Wyke Slipway;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Swan Inn, Stone 20/07/2001 Golden coloured and very sweet on the palate. Fruity wine like finish.
Newby Wyke Slipway;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;This has a fresh spicey aroma that perfectly complements this crisp, resfreshing bitter. Floral and fruity notes make this beer a good bitter.
Pitfield Black Eagle;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Old Ale;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);Bottle. Dark beer with a brown light bubbly head. The aroma is fruity, spiced and slightly vinous, the beer has a mulled nature to it. The flavour is mainly sour with a long dry finish. Overall a disappointing beer.
Pitfield Black Eagle;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Old Ale;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);Bottle. Black with a small cream head. Aromas are earthy roast malts with sour berries and hints of chocolate. Prickly on the nose and quite light. Flavours are roast malts with bitter coffee and some chocolate. Has an Ovaltine and oat type maltiness. Dry on the finish. Decent, if a bit thin.
Pitfield Black Eagle;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Old Ale;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);Cask Conditioned at The Gamecock, Harbury, Warks. Black bronze beer with healthy head. Overwhelming cardboard note at first sip with hard roasted malts. A little caramel and a dry hop on the finish. A touch of acidity, but mostly moist card.
Pitfield Black Eagle;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Old Ale;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);Bottle: Pours hazy dark brown with a small beige head. Slightly oaky aroma, but mostly mild caramel with a touch of roast. Sweetish start with a mildly fruity mid and finish. Some acidic notes in aftertaste, almost a little tart. Medium bodied, interesting.
Pitfield Black Eagle;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Old Ale;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);Nice. Real Nice. I would like some more body and bitterness. But a real nice beer.
Pitfield Black Eagle;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Old Ale;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);Bottle 750ml.Very dark brown in colour,small head,wood,coffee,chocolate,many unknown others,the range of flavours made me frown often.A strange ale indeed.De smeggin licious.
Pitfield Black Eagle;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Old Ale;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);Dec, 2002: Bottle Conditioned, There are four different malts and three different hops used in this dark and complex little brew. Deep, creamy, darkly fruity with a roller-coaster ride of assorted flavours. Star! O bright, brilliant star!
Pitfield Black Eagle;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Old Ale;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);"Cask at the Ipswich Beer Festival 2004, gravity dispense. Black (= very dark brown) colour. Interesting and unusual aroma: Ensilage, fresh mown grass, candy (""Kongen av Danmark""), hints of old ladies with a questionable personal hygiene. (Bordering on vomit, according to chris_o, but I liked it.) Flavour is grassy, citrussy, green apples. Easy drinking. Fruity finish."
Pitfield Black Eagle;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Old Ale;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);A clear brown beer with a chocolate brown head.

Great Waters Minnesota Wild Rice Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Great Waters Brewing;Dark brown color with a medium head. The aroma and taste are reminicent of a bag of wild rice instead of a well blended and cooked rice. Dusty grains protrude into the taste. Interesting and alright, but not the best wild rice beer.
Great Waters Minnesota Wild Rice Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Great Waters Brewing;Good Brown Coloring.. Nice Head. Aroma and Taste of Dry Wild Rice.. Nice and Crisp, Clean...Some Grains as Well.. Took a Few Sips to Agree with It, But Nice Wild Rice Brew!
Great Waters Minnesota Wild Rice Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Great Waters Brewing;Mild aroma of hops. Gold with a head that left a lace. Surprising fruit taste, and another flavor I couldn't nail down. A pleasant surprise. A session beer.
Great Waters Minnesota Wild Rice Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Great Waters Brewing;Color is a crispy brownish amber with a small cream colored head that sticks around a while and keeps an impressive haze on top the whole glass down to nearly empty. Wow! Smell again is nothing to get excited about, Great Waters brews seem to always have a disappointing nose, with the exception of Shipwreck IPA. This Wild Rice Ale has a little touch of frothy malt grains and wild rice. Taste starts clean and fresh, easy balanced malts and light hops with a very nice wild rice & grainy overlay that really stands out midway and helps with the over all crisp finish. Also has a nice calming herbal touch of hops. Nice subtle brew with good wild rice character and flavor. Feel is close to medium bodied and gains a bit of punch just past the midway point and has a nice crisp finish and some late notes of wild rice sticking late with a touch of herbal grains. A nice finisher, the wild rice seems to linger forever across the palette. A nice drinker as well, would go good with just about anything I imagine - or by itself. I liked it, a pleasant little beer.
Great Waters Minnesota Wild Rice Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Great Waters Brewing;Tap. Medium golden color with a good head. A little sweet. I can taste the rice. Some hops. A good solid beer.
Great Waters Minnesota Wild Rice Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Great Waters Brewing;Amber color, interesting. Nothing too exceptional in aroma, but the flavor is interesting--wild rice to be sure, but also fruity. Simultaneously dry and sweet?
Great Waters Sink the Bismarck German Black Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Waters Brewing;"Dark brown body, cocoa-colored head. Aroma is mild and creamy, though notes of coffee and cocoa perk up. Taste: nice, smooth, clean, if uncomplex. Just enough depth, though, to keep the tongue happy, medium body, neat texture. Easy drinking, ideal session-style brew. This was a ""German black"" at the pub, not a nomenclature Iâ€™ve encountered before. No matter, it was a nice enough ale."
Great Waters Sink the Bismarck German Black Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Waters Brewing;Color is a super nice solid deep dark brown and when held up to the light has some beautiful deep russet around the edges and helps eluminate the richer tones or glorious brown within. Thick cream colored head about a finger high which fades slowly to some hazy bubbles on top always present and layered lace in spotty sheets. A beauty of a glass to behold! OK, the smell absolutely is void and null with a fairly non-existent roasty malt and thats it! another disappointing nose form the beers at Great Waters. Aromatic malts need to be beefed up immensely! OK, taste is a step up in the right direction with a very mild and smooth with light roasted malts and dryish chocolate and cocoa with a touch of dried hops showing through in some of the finish. Would like to see some more roastyness and some dark fruity notes but none are found. That said the feel is actually pretty good, a medium body, creamy at first and has a light velvety feel coming through with a cottony late finish of drying, kinda nice, I liked it. A super smooth drinker, sits comfortably on the palette, not demanding much more, but boy it would be nice if it had some more flavor, heft, and body. Still a delightful beer to drink then the other mainstays at GW.
Great Waters Sink the Bismarck German Black Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Waters Brewing;Tap. Dark brown with a reddish tint. Some roasted malts. Rather plain....
Great Waters Sink the Bismarck German Black Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Waters Brewing;Dark mahogany with red peeping through against a light. Thin head, completely dissipating. Malty, but somewhat thin and overcarbonated. Muted flavors.
OGaras Cork Brown Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;OGaras Bar & Grill;Draft @ Brewpub: Dark brown, light white head and lacing. Nose of metal and starchy caramel. Spoiled eggs, dust. The flavor is nice at first, nutty, sweet, caramelly, but then it digresses to licking a 10 year old rusted sewer pipe. Finish is sharp, roasty, harsh.
OGaras Cork Brown Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;OGaras Bar & Grill;Sample from tap at the brewpub. Pours dark brown with little head. Aroma is vaue but has notes of roasted malt. Flavour is mildly roasted malt and a spicy coriander note. A bit odd, but works out okay.
OGaras Cork Brown Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;OGaras Bar & Grill;Clear mahogany body with beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, caramel, earthy/dusky, light chocolate. Taste is medium sweet, caramel, some earthy, some chocolate, floral, light infection sourness (not nearly as bad as some of their other beers). Light-medium body, smooth.
OGaras Cork Brown Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;OGaras Bar & Grill;Nice deep brown color with a good inch of tan foam. A little bit of lace throughout the pint. I have heard bad things about a sour off-flavor in Oâ€™Garaâ€™s brews. Sad to say, that nasty sourness was faintly noticeable in the aroma (and it was really the only aroma noticeable). Sourness dominated the flavor and mouthfeel of an otherwise thin brown ale. I also tasted a grainy (not roasted) flavor that was out of place. This sourness might be ok in a pseudo lambic or fruitybeer. But a brown ale? Not good stuff.
OGaras Cork Brown Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;OGaras Bar & Grill;Dark Brown Coloring with Good Head. It Wins on First Impressions. After That, Itâ€™s a Let Down. Malty...Sweet. Boring.
OGaras Cork Brown Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;OGaras Bar & Grill;Looks promising with a dark brown color and towering head. And thatâ€™s about where it stops. Sweet and sour malt with no nuttiness. Sigh... badness.
OGaras Cork Brown Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;OGaras Bar & Grill;"Solid dark brown of deep varnished oak, ruby highlights, very thin off-white head that fades fast and leaves minimal spotty lace. Smell is lightly roasty malts and nuts, hazelnuts. Taste is quick and roasty sweet with some nutty & fruity notions lightly playing on the palette but ends with some medicinal, metalic tingeyness mixing with a light roasty tang in the finish. Lighter body feel, getting close to medium, more so then any other of the beers so far by this""brewmaster"", but overall is stilll a watery mess, much like the rest at O'gara's brew pub. This place beats out Rock Bottom for bad brewpub beers thus far on my list. Stick with the Guiness on-tap while visiting this place."
OGaras Cork Brown Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;OGaras Bar & Grill;My first visit to O'Garas was a disappointment from a beer perspective. It is obvious that the beer is not this establishment's #1 priority. Cork Brown Ale is heavily acidic and somewhat vinegary. I tried the Sligo Red that my buddy ordered, and it was almost identical. Not recommended.
OGaras Cork Brown Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;OGaras Bar & Grill;Clear, deep red color. Malty sweet and sour. Some beers are unidimensional. This one is nondimensional.
OGaras Cork Brown Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;OGaras Bar & Grill;Tap. Brown color. Bubblegum aroma. Melt and caramel flavors. A touch of citrus.
OGaras Dublin Apricot Wheat;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;OGaras Bar & Grill;Hazy light yellow in color, thin white head, minimal spotty lace. Smell is light sweetish wheat with a touch of apricot, not very strong but readily discernible. Taste is very light with mostly apricot coming through and some very light hops and malts. Extremely watery feel, light, and tiresome. Somewhat drinkable but nearly unfinishable.
OGaras Dublin Apricot Wheat;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;OGaras Bar & Grill;Scent of apricot. Cloudy yellow. taste is a little sweet. Flavor of fruit and a little sourness. A good beer.
OGaras Dublin Apricot Wheat;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;OGaras Bar & Grill;"Hazy pale yellow (so light in color). Mildly fruity aroma. Watery, but a gentle apricot ""twang!"" with spicy hefe notes. Decent beer. A bit candy-like and with time, mildly sour."
OGaras Dublin Apricot Wheat;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;OGaras Bar & Grill;Tap. A hazy yellow color. Lots of apricot in the aroma and flavor. Tangy fruit body. The fruit and wheat aspects of this beer balance each other well.
John Harvards Vanilla Brown Ale;Wayne, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Wayne;I thought this was one of the more unique, more flavorful beers that I have had in many many moons. Overwhelming vanilla aroma, which impressed me, I figured it was just have a lisght vanilla and I was wrong. A big creamy frothy head that stayed around the glass the whole time I was drinking this. Just when you think the vanilla is fading it just mps right back in at the finish, saying her I am, and you want to drink more of me. All in all very enjoyable. Makes me want to go back and make a special trip to PA.
John Harvards Vanilla Brown Ale;Wayne, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Wayne;What an excellent brown ale, lots of vanilla in the nose, flavors & aftertaste, the vanilla was all over the place & it was very enjoyable, brown in color, excellent lacy head that was retained throughout the pint, excellent balance as well, the vanilla flavors were not overpowering at all, just enough in there to make sure that you knew it was there, very excellent beer, they also had this on the handpump, cask conditioned, but surprisingly it wasn''t as good as it was on the regular taps, awesome brown ale
Adler Brau Cherry Creek;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Straw/peach color with a light pink white head. Candied cherry aroma. Lager malt flavors infused with cherry fruit drink. Interesting, but not my type of beer.
Adler Brau Holiday Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Copper color with a rapidly dissipating head and a mild and familiar Christmas spicy aroma. This beer was a bit unbalanced, dry and hoppy with a faint sour note and a bitter finish. Reminds me of a homebrew recipe that needs a little tweaking. That said, a couple years ago I visited their brewpub and the on tap beers we tried were quite tasty. Bottle.
Adler Brau Holiday Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Ruby/chestnut color with a minimalistic light tan head. Dry malt aroma. Dry malt flavor. Dry acidic malt finish. Unremarkable.
Rommehed JulÃ¶l;Fors, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Avesta Bryggeri;Nice amber color. Aroma is rather weak, fruity, some fig?. Has a very sweet flavor, fruity, but far from as good as many other swedish x-mas beers.
Rommehed JulÃ¶l;Fors, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Avesta Bryggeri;Brown colour. Small white head. Weak malty and roasty aroma. Sweet and bready flavour with a poor malt structure. Some chemical notes. Unpleasant.

Rommehed JulÃ¶l;Fors, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Avesta Bryggeri;Bottled. Dark copper colour. Buttery aroma with notes of band-aid and...yes...cucumber. Only slight licoricy but apart from that not much of flavour. Pungent finish.

Elliott Bay Orange Infusion;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;Draft at Washington Brewerâ€™s Festival. Pours a hazy light orange amber with a short white head. The nose is fresh-squeezed orange juice and the taste is predominated by same. An interesting diversion in the world of beer.
Elliott Bay Orange Infusion;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;cloudy like hefe/ orange peel taste consumes all/ beer does not taste good. thereâ€™s a summation in haiku. but basically, when I want fruit flavour in my beer, I want the actual fruit. this tasted like the white stuff in an orange peel. you know how you throw away that part? i donâ€™t blame those who do the same here.
Elliott Bay Orange Infusion;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;Hazy orange with a light brown tinge. Pleasant refreshment of orange in the nose. However, the flavor, is a confusion of orange juice and other elements--rose hips, hibiscus, and lemongrass--which do not distinguish themselves. Sour and bland. The commercial description given sounded better than it tasted.

Lang Pils;Saal-Waltershausen, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Lang Waltershausen;Bottle, bought since this was my former partner's favourite beer. Aroma is buttery, bisquit and slightly sulphuric, rather malty. Body is medium, with a present malty sweetness leading into a decently bitter palate. Not trying to be dry though. Lacks roundness, pales on many fronts. Not bad, just a bit boring.

Lang Pils;Saal-Waltershausen, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Lang Waltershausen;50 cl bottle. Rated on 2.2.2010. Bright yellow colour, head stays on glass edges. Aroma is stale and grainy with hay and hints of vegetables. Flavout is thin, somewhat malty and slightly bitter with hints of hay. Drinkable, but feels bulky.
Lang Pils;Saal-Waltershausen, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Lang Waltershausen;Itâ€™s golden with a huge, creamy, white head.

Lang Pils;Saal-Waltershausen, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Lang Waltershausen;(bottle) Clear, pale golden colour with a medium-sized foamy white head, leaving some lace. Herbal hops and light sweet pale malt in good balance dominate the aroma, unfortunately with a metallic tinge. Light sweet, even lighter bitter flavour, light to medium body with a rather soft carbonation. Soft malty base, quite bland, malt-accented, light hoppy taste, the latter leaves traces of metal during the slim, vaguely balanced finish. Mediocre and disappointing compared to the good Kupferbier.
Lang Pils;Saal-Waltershausen, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Lang Waltershausen;Pale yellow color, not really lasting but well looking head. Sweet and spicy aroma. Starts sweet, continues spicier with a bitter touch on the tongue, longer dry and slightly bitter finish which I didn''t really like. Aftertaste lasts also too long, is herbal and sometimes bitter. Crisp impression. Overall characteristics a bit lacking.
Zhiguly Beer (Russian Label);Å iauliai, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gubernija;"Original review from 5/21/03. My God. I figured I had experienced bad beer. However, I had never had a Zhiguly Beer. Now that my eyesight has returned, I can write this review. This ""beer"" pours a cloudy, dark gold. On the downside &#40one of the many downsides&#41 there are particles of God knows what suspended in the liquid, like hundreds of little stink bombs just waiting to explode in your mouth. I know this is normal for this beer because folks at the Central Market in Plano have posted a sign on their cooler explaining that this is normal. In other words, we donâ€™t want this filth back! The head was incredibly vigorous. This, and the fact my tongue didnâ€™t melt, saves this beer from getting a ""1"" rating from me. I was mesmerized by the head. At least it was interesting to watch, kind of like a wildebeest being attacked by a lion...itâ€™s a fascinating sight but itâ€™s probably a bad idea to get in the middle of it. The odor is not inviting. Thereâ€™s a strong aroma of caramel and brown sugar. The flavor is not good but not the worst in the world...maybe itâ€™s just the worst in the western world. Roasted malt dominates the flavor...as in I can taste nothing else. There is no balance because thereâ€™s nothing to balance. Itâ€™s easy to juggle one apple. The mouthfeel is disappointing only because the incredible carbonation evident at the pour has dissipated to nearly nothing. Itâ€™s also a bit disconcerting because I expect the mystery particles to get caught between my teeth. I would hate to think I would have to floss after drinking a beer. If this is what I would have to look forward to if I ever visited Lithuania then I think Iâ€™ll go to Latvia instead. From this point on, I shall refer to this travesty as ""liquid cancer."""
Zhiguly Beer (Russian Label);Å iauliai, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gubernija;big brown plastic bottle(2000ml). -as Gubernija Zhigulevskoe Svetloe Pivo. Yellow coloured, small white head that went away fast leaving no lace, low carbonation, weak corn nose. Lack of everything here, the closest description would go like this: water with notes of dried vegetables extract mixed withchicken meat or ragout... Hm, my dear American ratebeer friends whatâ€™s wrong here???
Zhiguly Beer (Russian Label);Å iauliai, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gubernija;Gubernija Zhigulevskoe Svetloe Pivo brewed for the German distributor Monolith. ogivlado picked it up in a Russian store in Graz (thanks for sharing!). Poured an odd dull dark yellow/tan body with almost no head. Weak nose and Iâ€™m grateful that itâ€™s like that... smells of artificial chicken soup. The taste is weak and empty... cardboard, meat, peas, with some extremely weak (hoppy?) bitterness showing up from time to time. Less offensive than the sum of its parts but man this sucks.
Zhiguly Beer (Russian Label);Å iauliai, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gubernija;Bottled. A golden beer with a thin white head. The aroma is skunky with metallic notes of alcohol. The flavor is metallic and alcoholic, leading to a dry metallic finish. Not good.

Anyways, this pours slightly hazy golden with a tiny, unclean head. Odd aroma of vegetables, but not completely unpleasant. Medium body, a little flat in the mouthfeel - like most plasticbottled beers. Sweet accents of brewing cereal, a little cardboard and then a rough bitterness. Truly a relic from an ancient Soviet era. 301107"
Goose Island Dry Hopped Blonde Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);on tap from memory. this thin pale clear little beer actually had some decent hop flavor to it from the dry hopping. iâ€™ve never the non-dry hopped version but i think the dry hoping were the only thing this beer had going for it, not that it was over the top dry hopped but just noticible and pleasant. refreshing and decent.
Goose Island Dry Hopped Blonde Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sample at the Clybourn location. Almost no head topping a clear amber body...light piney-bready nose is pleasant without distinction...very juicy with lime, perhaps a bit of melon, hops light and sprucy, more pale malt than anything...fairly dull really.
Goose Island Dry Hopped Blonde Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draught, Clybourn Brewpub (2005 version): clear lemon with a thin starchy white head. Almost brisk hop aroma, that catches the nose, but doesnâ€™t stick â€“ sweet grains, lemon zest and pineapple are close at hand, but then disappear. You know, if I was drinking these all night I donâ€™t think I would mind â€“ mild flavoured with a bit hops and some grainy malt, but it is indistinct and unremarkable. Not bad.
Goose Island Dry Hopped Blonde Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);At the brewpub. Light gold colored body. The aroma was nic efloral hops with some oranges and herbs. The taste was sweet potatoes with some bread crust. There was also a subtle orange zest at the end.
Goose Island Dry Hopped Blonde Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Rather a bland offering from GI. It looks nice, a clear gold with a frothy white head that does some fine lacing. The aroma is dominated by the light resinous hops. This is thin and watery in the mouth. The flavor is negligible, a faint sweet grainy malt with some appreciated hop bitterness. (It added something to the taste.) The finish was a subdued, herbal hop bitterness. Goose Island Beer Company - Clybourn, Chicago, IL
Goose Island Dry Hopped Blonde Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Cask. Clear golden orange body with a tight, thick white head. Subtle, hoppy nose of light pine, toasted grains, alcohol, caramel, oranges and a touch of lemon zest. The body is awfully thin, which allows this to go down like water. The flavor is pretty good, a touch of sweet malt before a mildly bitter finish. This isnâ€™t the best Goose offering, but they did take a boring product and make it a little more interesting. A lucky find, in my quest to try them all.
Goose Island Dry Hopped Blonde Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Utterly magnificent. Goose Island''s finest achievement. Not to be confused with their generic blonde ale. This brew is cask-conditioned and served about 10 degrees warmer than their other beers. Handpumped, no less. It''s dry hopped for a slight bitterness that''s wonderful. A very mild and creamy brew.
General Lafayette Hoppy Holidays;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Copper Crow Beer Company;Draft. It was dark in the bar, but a deep amber colored with a creamy head. Bitter and hugely hoppy, like a IIPA without the sweetness. Smooth and crisp, but not balanced. I enjoyed it.
General Lafayette Hoppy Holidays;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Copper Crow Beer Company;Draft over Christmas. Slightly cloudy dark straw colored with a creamy white head and great lace. Aroma of big hops, malt, slight green tea. Tastes hoppy, malty, with a green tea essence. Medium palate.

General Lafayette Hoppy Holidays;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Copper Crow Beer Company;Second holiday beer this year from the General Lafayette. I wouldn''t call this beer a clone of Celebration Ale, but it''s close in taste and hop bitterness. I had this on draft and cask version, liked the cask version better for the extra bitterness.

Butterscotch and some grains and fruits on the nose. A bit less butterscotch in the flavor, but itâ€™s still there. Not much bitterness going on, barely dealing with the grains and fruits.

JT Schmids JT Light;Anaheim, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;JT Schmids Brewhouse & Eatery;Pale, clear yellow. Thin, watery, faint noble hop at the finish. I guess its good for what its supposed to be (something lite to drink when you want to hang out with people drinking beer).

A dark amber colored beer, clear, with a small, light beige head on top. Cute curtains. The aroma is a bit on the malty side for an amber I think, lacking on hops. Caramel tending towards butterscotch, some dried apricots too. It could also use a bit more bittering hops, not only aroma hops. Medium body and a nice carbonation level. Mostly malty finish, with some hoppy flavors in the back. A rather boring amber, but at least not foul. 130903

T: Nice coffee notes up front with plenty of roast and dark chocolate. Like with the aroma, thereâ€™s some good licorice and burnt sugar notes. However, this is a bit too sweet overall. M: Iâ€™d call the body medium with a smooth carbonation. O: Up there with the IPA in terms of the house beers. A nice stout, though it could do with a touch less sweetness.

Deeply caramelled aroma with hints of dates and almonds. Initially dry and lightly astringent with a walnut skin bitterness and burnt caramel aftertaste. Medium body.

I agree with Argo, it did seem more like an IPA in both aroma and flavor. (Actually I had ordered an IPA and was told that they were out, but that this was quite similar to what I had ordered.)

Old Bailey St. Honore Bruin;St.-Eloois-Winkel, Belgium;Dubbel;Old Bailey;Tasted some ten years ago when this brewery was still active. More an abt than a dubbel, this strong dark beer had a yellowish beige, thick creamy, rather unstable head and dark bronze colour with ruby hue, misty. Aroma was dark malts, milk chocolate, hazelnuts, a whiff of coffee grounds, lots of coriander, brown candi sugar, rhum, liquorice, blackcurrant, passion fruit, banana, marzipan, cinnamon, fried eggs. Full and creamy palate, sweet in onset, slick, chocolatey and caramelly with fruity accents (banana, pear), drying coriander effect in the middle, finish with lots of port-like alcohol but not too astringent, aromatically hoppy and ever so lightly roasted bitterish. Well crafted example of the style, too bad this isnâ€™t made anymore.

Tou JuleÃ¸l 6.5%;Oslo, Norway;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Flaske fra 1988 (!) pÃ¥ Cardinaltreff feb-13, stor takk til Ivar for omtanken. En helt spesiell opplevelse Ã¥ Ã¥pne en 25 Ã¥r gammel juleÃ¸l. Uklar oransje farge med snev av skum. Eimen som steg opp av glasset var langt fra behagelig, men den ble nÃ¦rmest portvinsaktig nÃ¥r den hadde fÃ¥tt luftet seg litt. Overraskende god smak med streif av honning og portvin. En Ã¸lopplevelse helt utenom det vanlige!
Tou JuleÃ¸l 6.5%;Oslo, Norway;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Bottle ,vintage 1988, kindly shared by Ivar. Poured a light dirty and hazy orange, no head.

Tou JuleÃ¸l 6.5%;Oslo, Norway;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Kindly shared by my beerpal, Ivar. Clear 0,33 l shared bottle. Opaque orange with a white rim.

Tou JuleÃ¸l 6.5%;Oslo, Norway;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);"This traditional ""klasse F"" (strong) Christmas beer has the last years been given the lowest or second lowest ""klasse F"" rating in Norwegian newspapers. I can understand why - it's now too lightbodied for its strength, flavour is slightly metallic, a substantial bitterness is not balanced by an equally substantial malty sweetness like a real ""JuleÃ¸l"" should have. Colour is reddish brown, low head. I think this beer was considerably better 20 - 30 years ago, before Tou Bryggeri (Stavanger) became part of the Ringnes group."

Youngs Elysium;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;golden orange colour, with clear elderflower nose and taste, will do well with the ladies, and on a hot summersday
Youngs Elysium;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Golden to orange color, nice perlage. Simple aroma: sweet, a bit malty, oranges, rubber. Simple taste, with a residual sweetness and a light pleasant fruitness. Nice bitterness, and in the finish finally we find the elderflowers. Easy and interesting drink before a dinner.
Goose Island Prodigal Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Dark with an average head. Subtle roasted character. Light chocolate and coffee throughout and hoppy bitterness in the finish. A pleasant and satisfying porter.
Goose Island Special Brown Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at Clybourn brewpub. Poured hazy dark brown color with medium off-white fizzy head that diminished slowly with good lacing. Medium brown sugar aroma. Medium body with light carbonation. Medium balanced sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Sweet drinkable brew.
Goose Island Special Brown Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Goose Island - Clybourn. Poured deep, hazy reddish-brown with a short yellowy-beige head. The aroma picked up dark fruits, caramel, and chocolate with a deeply-rooted, clearly evident alcohol presence.. came across quite brash. The flavor had sweet drawn caramel and brown sugar at the core laced with raw grainy alcohol.. the same sweetness found the finish, as did the booziness that marred my enjoyment of the beer. Medium-bodied on the palate with lower carbonation.. too much sharpness.

Goose Island Special Brown Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);pretty good. red/brown appearance with a decent head. flavors start sweet with nut caramel and toffee. as it finishes the flavors become more grainy/bready. a strong brown ale, but not exceedingly exciting.
Goose Island Special Brown Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Not as rich or complex as the nut brown. A little thin, a little translucent. Taste is initially bitter, but fades fast. a little nutty and sweet. Meh.
Goose Island Special Brown Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);I had this at the Clybourne and i got the regular nut brown and this to see if i could tell the difference. truth is no. The regular nut brown was darker and was more creamier. Maybe was more nutty in aroma. Other than the extra alcohol there is no reason to spend the extra dollar on a pint of this.
Goose Island Special Brown Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);A small, tan head is very fizzy above a deep mahogany body (that matched the bar), with carbonation equally evident within. There is an initial light touch of hops in the aroma followed by whisky and a sharp lemon bite. Malts take a backseat until the flavor, where they are revealed with a wicked-potency. This fades slowly to simple tea-bitters. With a lively mouthfeel itâ€™s rather sharp & crisp for such a malty brew. On tap at Goose Island Beer Company (Clybourn), Chicago, IL 60614
Goose Island Special Brown Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"Maybe if Iâ€™d had the cask version that the others have rated this year, Iâ€™d be more excited about this beer. What I had was a 6.9% sweet, malty brown ale with very few hops to balance it out. Quaffable, but merely ""okay."" Goose Island Beer Company - Clybourn, Chicago, IL"
Goose Island Special Brown Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampled on Cask at GI Clybourne This beer is a full brown color, and it is topped by a frothy tan colored head. The aromas is lightly roasty with notes of coffee, caramel, and a hint of burnt fruit. The taste is sweet, with a malty fullness to it that is quite nice. I also get notes of brandy, cherries, alcohol, rum and caramel. This beer is so soft and creamy, with a low carbonation to it. This is definitely a great beer to have on cask, it seems to soften it and make it all that much more quaffable. This is tasty and I am quite enjoying the glass of beer that I was poured.
Goose Island Special Brown Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On cask in Wrigleyville. Reddish brown, largest foamy head--not at all like the creamy head I like to see on cask conditioned ales. Nose is earthy, slightly sour. Smooth mouthfeel, almost flat. Not exactly earthshaking but drinkable.
St Arnou Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;St Arnou;minimal head sits upon a pale yellow poor. Not much in the way of aroma. A nice crisp taste. Nice enough for a straight up pale ale

St Arnou Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;St Arnou;didnt have high expectations for this beer so i wasnt let down. an inital smell of skunk soon disapated, the colour and head isnt much to speak of, rather poor. tastes of orange and hoppy citrus flavours, mid to high carbonation, overall quite an average beer. i really dont think it should be in the 48th percentile, i can think of many other beers that rate lower and are much more enjoyable
St Arnou Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;St Arnou;Pours lively but settles down with haste. Carbonation minute, in fine streams. Head struggles its height retreating back to a thin pad of white with no lacing. Body is orange amber, not quite clear with some floaties of questionable origin. The bottle looks as though clear glass has been spray-painted with cola coloured lacquer, strange!!. Aroma of mango and peach, salted, roasted nuts, rubber and vine clippings. Creamy mouthfeel dulls out quick, light in body. Some bitterness to the back end and into the swallow. Light notes of toasted grain and pine-wood, some freshness of orange flesh and zest. Aftertaste of peanuts, pine and subtle citrus. Pretty unexciting unfortunately. Slam one back with too much ease, nothing here to get the brain ticking. Think Iâ€™ll stick with there Pilsner given the choice!! (33cL, no date stamp, Dan Murphyâ€™s Mandurah)
St Arnou Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;St Arnou;fantastic pale ale, very drinkable. grassy with some strong fruity flavours
St Arnou Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;St Arnou;"Bottle: Looks pleasantly summery in the glass; all froth and golden highlights. In the nose there is some tart malt and a faint whiff of lemon. Rolled around the mouth, this beer gives a pleasant creamy mouthfeel, with a very restrained but well utilised bitterness. I found myself wishing for more flavour, though. Sure there is plenty of golden malt and a memory of fresh bitey herbs, but I wanted some character and some distinction. Still, this isnâ€™t to take away the good points of what is a solid drinking beer."
St Arnou Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;St Arnou;Thin white head over a light amber body. Nose of grass and fresh cut lawns, hints of a salty breeze as well. Apricot and hop grass notes, bittier finish. Crisp palate. Actually reminds me of Storm Golden Ale out of Bali. Not bad...
St Arnou Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;St Arnou;Tap. Nice aroma, but too sweet flavour. Aroma is citrusy, and bubblegum. Flavour is sweet, with average length, and only light bitterness. Palate is oily, and medium-bodied. Yellow colour, with a fizzy head that disappears.
St Arnou Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;St Arnou;Bottle. Gold with fading white head. Hay malts and floral and citrus hops on the nose. Clean, slightly bitter finish. This is a weird beer. I disliked it the first time I had it because I was expecting some sort of pale ale. I see itâ€™s listed here as gold/ blond. But it comes across as a pils with some wit characteristics. Once my confounded expectations were adjusted, I quite liked it.
Harmon Melange Stout;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Stout;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;one of the best stouts ive ever had in my life, so malty and rich!!!! some very good stuff.
Harmon Melange Stout;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Stout;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;Pretty thin looking. Overly coffee flavored and not much else to say about it. Very bland and not much going for it.
Harmon Melange Stout;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Stout;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;This beer is black and nothing else. Black in appearance and flavor. The flavor and aroma are very, very espresso, too much actually. It is apparently aged in oak barrels but the flavor is too overpowering to notice any oakiness that may have complimented it. This beer could be so much more but it is not.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Bock;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;Nice dark color. Only a thin head but it leaves nice rings of lace with each sip. Pleasant malt flavor balanced by a nice bit of hops in the aroma and the finish. Like other brews by Rock Bottom it's boring but there's nothing really bad about it.
Great Dane Cherry Isthmus Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Near black with a light tan head. Dark cherry and roasted malts in the aroma. A touch of acidity noted. Flavors of mocha, bitter dark chocolate and cherries. Perhaps a bit like a lactic stout with some cough medicine. A one and done type brew.
Great Dane Cherry Isthmus Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"Served as ""Cherry Cream Stout"". Sweet creamy cherry nose with milk chocolate underneath. Pretty similar flavor - big sweet cherry on top of sweet chocolate. A simplistic but very tasty sweet stout. Coffee in the finish."
Great Dane Cherry Isthmus Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"On tap at brewery...Was not called ""Cherry Isthmus"" but Iâ€™ll put it here. An attractive garnet hue in an almost black beer. Not a great head, that detracts. Cherry essence in the nose, with some sweet malt. Cherries are evident and the taste was just a bit on the artificial side, with a bit of an aftertase. I would have preferred a stronger stout character, but it works pretty well for a Holiday brew."
Great Dane Cherry Isthmus Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"Cherry colored dust head. Deep ruby hues around the edges of an otherwise black brew. Smells like a chocolate covered cherry. Unfortunately the stuot part doesn""t hold up its end of the bargain the way it aught to. Thin and watery. Needs more body and a better malt presence."
Great Dane Cherry Isthmus Stout;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;The clever name is the only thing worth remembering about this godawful abomination of a stout. Absolutely no cherry aroma or flavor that I could detect, soapy flavor, very weak and watery. I asked the waitress if it could be off, and she said it was her favorite with a look as if to imply that I was crazy. As the other beers were fine and I was in a hurry, I didn''t press her, and so this drain pour. Couldn''t finish my 4 oz sample, first time I''ve ever done that.
City Steam Flower of Edinburgh;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;City Steam Brewery;Draft at the source, 1/09/2014. Light amber color with lasting head retention. Aroma is a botanical garden, abundance of flowers nothing but a tom of flowers. Flavor is like drinking old ladys perfume with a very subdued hint of peat.only got the peat in the last half oz. Heather flower... A lot of heather flower. Not my thing.
City Steam Flower of Edinburgh;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;City Steam Brewery;on tap-pours a light tan head that bubbles and copper color. Aroma is sweet medium malt, yeast. Taste is sweet medium malt-bubblegum, yeast, peat. OK/mild carbonation.
City Steam Flower of Edinburgh;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;City Steam Brewery;Hazy copper, gentle off-white ring. Feeling spicy for a scotch ale. Smells of leatherette more or less, though also of apricot. So itâ€™s a fruity ale, but in a very candied way. And its alcohol vapors are vulgar. Vicks vaporub + mint/cinnamon notes. What did that ever have to do with beer? Flower finish. Very warming and candied. Very thin, yet slightly sticky palate. A mess.
City Steam Flower of Edinburgh;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;City Steam Brewery;In short: A lazy melted hard-candy trying to pass as a scotch ale How: Tap at brewpub The look: Cloudy dark copper body with a little beige ring of foam In long: Malt profile/sweetness is very much hard-candies, crisp and a little sugary. Not the rich creamy caramel of the good scotch ales. alcohol is way too present with nowhere to hide in that weak crispy malt. Some berries here and there. Got some distant mint and cinnamon flavour too although that may be a residual flavour from the spicy beer I had just before. As a scotch ale that Flower of Edinburgh is about as credible and honest as the flowers I buy when I feel guilty about something.
City Steam Flower of Edinburgh;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;City Steam Brewery;"My Bottom Line: Heaps of alcohol drive through the wayward smokiness of this confusing strong Scotch Ale. Distinctly lacking in caramelization, its body was sadly anemic and its malty profundity was nearly absent. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam circumspects the orangey red. -A nutmeg-like, perfumy spiciness is found in the nose; with the drying smoke, this is definitely not your typical Scotch Ale nose. -Some caramel sweetness accompanies the pointy earthy smoke in the finish. -Effervescence is soothing. On tap at the brewpub."
City Steam Flower of Edinburgh;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;City Steam Brewery;Pours brownish red with a thin white head. Served in a snifter at the brewpub. Smells strongly of peat moss at the forefront before giving way to a nice malt base. Tastes very smokey with some caramel and fruity notes.
City Steam Flower of Edinburgh;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;City Steam Brewery;On draught at brewery with Clarkvv 8/11/2005: Mostly clear copper body with a small white head that quickly dies. The aroma is quite unique as far as scotch ales go. Itâ€™s simply packed with smoke, and it has the peaty/earthy/sulfur qualities that youâ€™d find in Islay whiskey. The nose also has a definite bacon and meat aroma as well. The taste is meaty smoke, spicy earth, sweet caramel, sweet grains, and some phenols. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, gets a bit syrupy and sweet over time. I like the excess smoke here, but it needs more body and base grains to back it up.
City Steam Flower of Edinburgh;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;City Steam Brewery;16oz draught at the brewery with Bucknaked on 8/11/2005. Amber-copper colored beer with a rapidly fleeting head. Nothing left behind, not even bits of bubbles. Fairly clear, no haziness in this sample. Smoke pours forth from the nose, bacon and pork rinds. Band-aid phenols abound. Smells like smoked band-aids. Tastes like band-aids too, mixed in with some pork bbq. Sweet, caramelly with a very low carbonation. Light acid and some dried black cherries. Thick and syrupy with some notes of plastic and medicine (band-aids more or less) smokiness. Really not that bad, just need to work on bringing forth some other flavors than just pure smoke and caramel. Pretty difficult to finish this much, starts to get cloying on the end, rather candyish. Could use more carbonation to make it more drinkable. I think the Scotch ale designation is a good one. Medium-full body, but somewhat watery. Slick, heavy mouthfeel.
City Steam Flower of Edinburgh;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;City Steam Brewery;3 Oz sample. Very smoked aroma with a ton of smoked bacon. This is definitely more reminiscent of a Rauchbier. Transparent copper color with small white head. Again, closer to a Rauch than a Scotch in color. Lots of smoke up front. Smoked bacon notes. Finishes slightly sweet and caramelly. This is not a Scotch Ale at all. It is a light Rauchbier, one that is not too shabby.
City Steam Flower of Edinburgh;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;City Steam Brewery;Draught: The beer is served in a small brandy snifter. It is served pretty much ice cold, which doesn't do it justice. I allowed it to warm up, which definitely brought out the flavors and aroma. The beer is a copper color, and is a bit hazy. No much carbonation or head. There is a distinct peat aroma. The taste is very malty, with a lingering sourness at the end. There was a definite taste here, but I couldn't quite pick out what it was. Still, a fairly good beer.
City Steam Naughty Nurse Amber Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - English;City Steam Brewery;Pours hazy amber with a one finger, light tan head. Aroma is roast and light hops. Taste is caramel, moving to pepper and light hops. Finish is caramel. An OK amber.
City Steam Naughty Nurse Amber Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - English;City Steam Brewery;Draft at Pig Eye Pub. Pours clear bright amber with a fizzy off white head.

City Steam Naughty Nurse Amber Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - English;City Steam Brewery;Light, bubbly, pretty refreshing. Would be a good choice for a hot summer day if no other good options are available
City Steam Naughty Nurse Amber Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - English;City Steam Brewery;Aroma: Crisp aroma, light, soft yeast, very faint from pointy glass. Not detecting much aroma. Appearance: Clear body, Amber in color. Head is white, thins quickly but is retained, little lacing. Texture is small bubbles with medium scattered throughout. Flavor: initially tart apples, slight sweetness from the malts. As it settles the malts have a nice roasted flavor with a touch of caramel. The hops brighten the beer, bringing a low bitterness and balancing the beer without overpowering the flavor. Balance is malty and the finish is sweet. Mouthfeel: Body is thin with high carbonation, no alcohol warmth. No noticable astringency detected. Overall: not a bad amber but while refreshing not overly complex, a straightforward amber beer.
City Steam Naughty Nurse Amber Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - English;City Steam Brewery;Pours amber with a thick white head. Pleasant aroma of wheat and malt. Taste is similarly sweet with a strong malt body and an earthy palate. Palate also includes resinous hops. Really good ale. Floral.
City Steam Naughty Nurse Amber Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - English;City Steam Brewery;Can shared with my wife. Pours a hazed amber with a medium sized white head. Soft malt and toast on the nose, light toast. Medium bodied, sweet with some malt, a bit of toast. Malt and toast into the finish, with a bit of plum sweetness. Easy and toasty with a bit of sweetness and gentle malt lingering.
City Steam Naughty Nurse Amber Ale;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - English;City Steam Brewery;Amber/orange color, clear.

Schlappeseppel;Grossostheim, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Eder & Heylands Brauerei;So-called â€™historicalâ€™ beer which was brewed for the king of Sweden in 1631, but we all know beers in those days were never bottom-fermented and pale at the same time. Anyway, this one had a light yellowish, thin and unstable head and deep â€™old goldâ€™ colour, clear. Rather neutral aroma with primarily caramelly malt sweetness and some faint hints of vanilla, iron and aromatic hops. Pure malt sweetish taste, otherwise neutral and even a bit watery, simple, with a brief and floral hint of hop bitterishness in the finish.

Le Cheval Blanc Scottish Ale;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Scottish Ale;Le Cheval Blanc - Brasseur Artisan & Bar;Strong aroma of peated malt and caramel. Pours a murky brown color with a thin white head. The flavor has luscious smoked and caramel malt, but thereâ€™s also an unpleasant feeling that ruins the tasting experience partly. The body is medium with a creamy texture and soft carbonation.
Le Cheval Blanc Scottish Ale;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Scottish Ale;Le Cheval Blanc - Brasseur Artisan & Bar;Hazy pale amber body displays a tiny white ring bearing small lacing. Soft malts procure a well presented leatheryness coming out powdery and expertly earthy. While apple skin nuances attenuate the potential malt sweetness, a developing underlying dryish character kicks in to enhance drinkability greatly. Biting small bubbles, light-medium body. A very pleasant take in which balance is key.

Le Cheval Blanc Scottish Ale;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Scottish Ale;Le Cheval Blanc - Brasseur Artisan & Bar;(Draught) Pint for $5 at the brewpub on November 20, 2005. Pours a thin, white lasting head with a reddish caramel body. Little carbonation. Nose and flavour is mildly smoked and earthy. Lacking the robust flavours of the Erable and California which were also available - leaving me wanting more depth.
Le Cheval Blanc Scottish Ale;MontrÃ©al, Quebec, Canada;Scottish Ale;Le Cheval Blanc - Brasseur Artisan & Bar;Lovley. Itâ€™s not a scotch ale, itâ€™s a scotish style ale, ie remenicent of the beer the actualy drink in scotland, and I gota say, Iâ€™m shure all will agree that this one clearly had youngers tartan special as the inspiration. Pours a crystal clear rusty coper with a thin whispy white head, and a fizzy carb level. Palat is fizzy and dry, very refreshing. Taste is overall light and simple. Toasty malt makes a dominatny aperance for just a second, quickly folowed by a significant yet not nearly overpowering hit from some bitter hops, folowed by a nutty smoothness. The aftertaste is lightly bitter, very very dry, and lingers for about 2 mins. I like it alot, but Iâ€™m shure it will be gone soon. Look at other ratings for this brewpub, rarely more than 2 or 3 before the beer is gone. Get it while it lasts, itâ€™s great. Cheers.

Barrington Vienna;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Cask sample at the source. The beer is a clear gold with a white head of foam. Dry, floral notes. Some nut hulls. Mild bitterness, and a little floral in the taste. Light body and moderate carbonation.
Barrington Vienna;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;"Bomber into a sweet Tiffanyâ€™s crystal glass from Coreyâ€™s wedding. Pours an Amber glazed orange, thin white head, thin lacing, mellow mood. Bottle says ""New Englander: Mass HOPS Maine Malt"". Name change it must be. Itâ€™s solar brewed, no doubt. Aroma of sleek vanilla, frontal ripe orange, and crystal malt. Taste of slightly bitter candied vanilla orange twists, drinks nicely. Amber highlight prevail but pronounced are the sweeter candied additions of melon, orange peel, white grape, and prestound crystal malts. Not a hop forward beer at all, should skip mentioning the hops at all, but oh well. Nice brew to listen to phish 7/29/15 Texas to. Cheers."
Barrington Vienna;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Bottle from at least two years ago, which was an unexpected consequence of buying a house and having bottles sit hidden away for a while. So there. Anyway, without much intention of this beer being good, it pours a clear amber orange gold with an enormously large white head. Sweet floral paper and fruit on the nose. Smells a bit of vinyl Kool-aid with sweet candy and sugar over the top. Again my fault for aging it two years, but thatâ€™s what it is after that length. Sweet wheat and musk leads into a bit of tartness and acidity, definitely has picked up a bit of funk and maybe some infections. Fortunately it turns out well, or at least better than expected. Picks up some tart notes and a bit of a musky sweet note. Finishes with more lingering tartness. Clearly not what was intended, but still interesting to drink.
Barrington Vienna;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Oh boy, this one was like eating a batch of Grandmaâ€™s home-baked biscuits. So very...bready. And yeasty. Poured a nice, slightly cloudy golden color. Bready nose, very little head. A pretty tasty brew on the whole.
Barrington Vienna;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Bomber. Pours gold with a slight chill haze and a nice white head.

Barrington Vienna;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Clearish straight golden lager. A smallish white head initially covers it and procures moderate lace, but slowly fades. Enormously bready, but thatâ€™s unfortunately pretty much all there is. A mild toastiness and a rounder cerealic feel combine into a rather vegetal display, think the blandest brand of rice or plain and wetter flour. Sweet, yet its carbonation unloads a wave of biting small bubbles. Lazy hops are almost absent. No bitterness, just linear malts. Medium bodied and soporific.
Barrington Vienna;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;My Bottom Line: Simple bready malts form a decent body in which furtive hops tickle the ending for an overly basic and quiet golden Vienna. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam tops the hazy hay gold. -The tranquil carbonation and lean body increase drinkability. -Maltiness plays biscuity cracker notes too. -Watery passages get tiresome soon enough. Bottle.
Barrington Vienna;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Big malty aroma, medium to medium-heavy diacetyl. Medium dark honey gold, decent bomber, bright foil cap cover. Grain sweetness, lightly bitter, honey flavors. Finishes the same way. Medium body. Thanks to DW for bringing this back from MA.
Barrington Vienna;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Medium golden pour, fluffy white head. Yeasty, buttery aroma with hints of caramel - full bodied. Flavor has some sticky sweetness, a hint of caramel and some doughy notes with a hint of butterscotch. Thickish mouthfeel. Brought back from one of Aureliusâ€™s work partners from the brewbub in a bomber. Very decent.
Barrington Vienna;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;"Smells like a wet rabbit hutch - which is not always a bad smell. Clear golden color. Instead of being called ""Vienna"", it should be called ""Golden"" because that is what color it is - and also Golden, CO is where they make Coors...which is this beerâ€™s identical twin."
Calumet Total Eclipse;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Draft at OF. Opaque black-brown color with an excessively large off-white head.

Calumet Total Eclipse;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;draft: dark black, frothy white head, aroma of malts, taste is sour, malty with a thin body, donâ€™t care for the lingering sourness from this one...edit: after reading the other ratings here I wonder if I was given the wrong beer or if there was a problem with the keg I was drinking from...
Calumet Total Eclipse;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On tap @ The Old Fashioned - Pours deep black with a small tan head. Not quite the total eclipse I was expecting, as you can see some light get through it at the edges of the glass, but dark nonetheless. There wasnâ€™t a ton on the nose, even as I let it sit for a bit. Itâ€™s milky, with some sour malt and a little baking spice. Taste is nutty with some nice dryness. Bready, bitter malt on the finish, and smooth and velvety down the throat. Goes down real easy, but full enough to satisfy. Calumet continues to impress me.
Calumet Total Eclipse;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Thanks to skyview for sharing this dark pour. Roasted malt aroma, slightly grainy in character. Light mouthfeel with a roasted/burnt coffee malt flavor.
Calumet Total Eclipse;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Beer tasting at Cellars Lex/Larpenteur. Thanks Bob (Skyview) for this treat! Roasty notes and a nice flavor here. Unfortunately the sample was served too cold and from a growler it was undercarbonated, which lessened the experience. I think this would be a nice beer with the right conditions. Glad I was able to sample.
Calumet Total Eclipse;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Shared by Skyview. A good schwarzbier. Simple but good roasted aroma. Flavor is like an oatmeal stout, with the roasted flavor the dominant character. Rich malt, and oak in the aftertaste.

Calumet Total Eclipse;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On draught at the brewpub in Chilton, Wisconsin. Pours a dark, near opaque, clear brown brew with a creamy and thick off-white head that slowly disipates to a fine film and off-white head. Some spotty lacing but still quite thick. Aroma of sweet black malt, toasted multi-grain malt and a touch of sweetened coffee. Taste is medium to full bodied, very light carbonation with a grainy texture. Flavors has mostly dark toasted multi-grain malt with little hop presence. Finish is slightly dry with a dark toasted malt aftertaste along with a short lived mild bitterness.

Troutbrook ESB;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Please note that on my older reviews I used a 100 point scale. To make up for any scoring discrepancies, all palate and apearance scored are assigned a neutralized 3/5. Undated 2001 ?: This is a very tasty beer with a lot of earthiness to it. It looks great in the glass and is very full bodied.
Elgoods Santas Special;Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Elgoods Brewery;The beer has a good head that lasts a long time. The aroma is lightly hopped, but the flavour is like bitter weak water. Generally a poor flavourless watery beer. A gimick for Christmas.
Delafield 8-Malt Stout;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Delafield Brewhaus;Didnâ€™t fancy this too much. Itâ€™s smooth up front with lots of roasted coffee in the back. I definitely prefer the Pewaukee Porter over this.

River Horse McHenrys Irish Stout;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Stout;River Horse Brewing Company;On tap at the Porterhouse Brepub. A nice stout, if just a little watery for my taste.

Lake Superior Amber Ale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Reviewed from notes. This seemed like the darker version of their ESB. Somewhat of an amber color with a little white foamy cap of a head falling off at a decent pace. Not much lace. The aroma did have a bigger sweeter malt presence of the ESB, more caramel and toffee. And not just the grassy hops come back but some citrusy hops come out in this one. The flavor balanced with a more bittersweet blend of hops and malts. The ratio seemed a bit bolder. Light citrusy to malty aftertaste. Not much of a finish. The feel was just a tad under medium in body with a pretty good sessionable sort of smoothness to it. Hops arenâ€™t too abrasive here. Overall, pretty good amber ale that I could have again.
Lake Superior Amber Ale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Draft Brewery 8/16/04 -Pours a medium amber with a small head. Aroma of caramel, malt, and slight toffee. Taste of the same with more malt. This medium bodied brew is not too shabby.

Sonoran Top Down Kolsch Style Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;Sonoran Brewing Company;bottle-from what flacoalto told me, this bottle could be over a year old. I was kind of hesitant to even try it, but i did and i must say, i was suprised how well this beer turned out. pours a light orange hue with a small fizzy white head with some good retention. citric aroma mostly, kinda banana in a sense-maybe from the german yeast used? became estery as the bottle got old? maybe so. flavors are malty and some good bitters from light spicy hops. not really a true kolsh again, but still not bad. body is light medium with some roughness around the edges. not bad if you ask me, especially considering the age of this bottle.
Sonoran Top Down Kolsch Style Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;Sonoran Brewing Company;The aroma stood out for me in this one.

Grainstore Rutland Beast;Oakham, Rutland, England;Stout;Grainstore Brewery (Rutland Brewing Co.);"Cask at the Hope Tap (JDW), Reading. Wahoo! At last! My 5th Rutland Rate! Have wanted to find this beer for a while now, good on 'Spoons getting this in. Decent condition too. It's a nice-looking beer - glowing mahogany in hue with a decent beige head and a light fizz. There's toffee, caramel, a touch of coffee, some plum and some wood. The mouthfeel is full, but a little slimy from the caramel. There's a hint of rough vodka. As others have noted, it's not a stout; it sits somewhere between an ESB and a strong mild I reckon. It would make a nice autumn or winter warmer, but possibly wasn't the ideal brew for a warm summer's day. Who cares though - it's a RUTLAND RATE!!!"
Grainstore Rutland Beast;Oakham, Rutland, England;Stout;Grainstore Brewery (Rutland Brewing Co.);Not too bad. Dark, borderline typical stout flavours but not as heavy and so is a dark mild, not a stout. Some coffee, raisin, fruity flavours to this beer. Smell is typically dried fruit. It's not bad, but it's not the greatest. Good for what it is but nothing stands out to make me think 'wow, I will remember this beer for a while and look out for it again in future'.
Grainstore Rutland Beast;Oakham, Rutland, England;Stout;Grainstore Brewery (Rutland Brewing Co.);Pint at the Crosse Keys. A dark colour in the glass and a very foamy and long-lasting head. The taste and the mouthfeel was all about those malts and they were quite sweet. A definite amped up mild, but not yet an Imperial Mild (that's something to try should anyone decide to brew it). A bit too much for a lunchtime beer and at the end it became a bit cloying.

Barley Island Rust Belt Porter;Noblesville, Indiana, United States;Porter;Barley Island Brewing;Thanks to Bob, Michelle, and mostly my baby Jana for the 12th annual Indiana Microbrewers Festival today! On tap @ the fest. Nose of oats & cereal, coffee and nectar. The brew is dark walnut with ruby highlights. The slow cascade meanders into a tan creamy head that is mostly lasting with good lace. The beer has a fruity & alcoholic start with a roasted coffee finish. The medium body is creamy and very soft. The finish feels chalky.

Has aroma of dark chocolate and coffee. Flavor is pretty smooth consisting of same dark chocolate/coffee taste. This was first porter so I donâ€™t have much to compare it to. Update- Second trial 07/01/06 For some reason the July batch seemed to have lost some of itâ€™s flavor. Seemed to be watered down
Barley Island Rust Belt Porter;Noblesville, Indiana, United States;Porter;Barley Island Brewing;Tap at brewery - Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, and a touch of coffee. Pours black with nice brown lasting head and great lacing. Flavor touches aroma character but doesnâ€™t follow up. Palate is smooth and creamy but too thin. Tasty and easy drinking, but the body is too light for a porter.
Barley Island Rust Belt Porter;Noblesville, Indiana, United States;Porter;Barley Island Brewing;A stinker. Hoppiness would be appropriate with some malt present, but unfortunately, this is maybe the lightest porter on the planet, so the hoppiness seems overdone. I have homebrewed for 17 years and have been disappointed with porters better than this. Three cheers for Diet Porter (or not)!!!
Barley Island Rust Belt Porter;Noblesville, Indiana, United States;Porter;Barley Island Brewing;Growler shared by Scott. Pours out dark brown with a faint tinge of burgundy. Small tan head left some lacing for as long as it lasted. Aroma was roasted coffee, some notes of chocolate, malt powder. It was a bit thin in the mought and low in alcohol for a porter. The flavor was pleasant. The coffolate combo with a smathering of malted milk balls. Nice drink.
Barley Island Rust Belt Porter;Noblesville, Indiana, United States;Porter;Barley Island Brewing;On tap. Very flavorful porter. Definitely better than average. It has the roasty malts flavor that is preferable for a dark variety.

Medium-thin beige head and sticky lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma consists of coffee and burnt chocolate. Medium-bodied and smooth with a decent mixture of coffee, chocolate and malt flavors. The hops come through pretty well in the finish. Overall this is a well-balanced and fairly well-done Porter.

Wisconsin Dells Stand Rock Bock;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Tap at OF. Sweet, sugary, amateur hour experiment. Overly sugary sweet, brown chocolate intensity. Pretty insipid, almost embarrassingly subpar. Taste like malt syrup. No balance, just sweet malt. Not all our bad, just not good. Numbers seem generous.
Wisconsin Dells Stand Rock Bock;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;On tap at the Old Fashioned. Deep brown, mahogany. A little roast, but mostly toasted and Munich malts. Flavor is some mild dark fruits and a hint of roasted malt. A bit of an odd acidic middle/finish. Other than that, just okay.
Wisconsin Dells Stand Rock Bock;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;"Listed as 6.1%. I didnâ€™t create a new beer for this, as its pretty likely the recipe didnâ€™t change. This beer was the highlight of the beer drinking day. There were lots of sweet Munich malts that left me wanting more. Robust flavor of caramelized malts, subtle chocolate, and simple light hopping. The palate was clean and ""lagery""."
Wisconsin Dells Stand Rock Bock;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;An old rating, courtesy of Skyview. Grain aroma. Smooth on the palate, and more flavor unprocessed grain with some carmelized sugar. Black, and just hint of grain sourness. Not as heavy on the palate as some bocks, but good anyway.
Wisconsin Dells Stand Rock Bock;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Growler courtesy of Skyview. This was delicious.

Pours a clear dark copper brown brew with a creamy off-white head that quickly dissipates to a fine ring. Aroma of dark caramel malt, some light chocolate, flowery hops, a touch of pumpernickel and dark fruits. Taste is medium to full bodied, light carbonation with fruity flavors of dark pitted fruits, roasted dark malt, a touch of dark chocolate and a light coffee character. Finish is creamy and very malty of dried dark malt along with a semi-sweet fruit aftertaste that slowly disappears after the finish. The three month aging really smoothed out the beer texture and flavor quite well.

Wisconsin Dells Honey Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Keg @ Moose Jaw. Gold pour with a tiny white head. Unbelieveably neutral nose - I feel like Iâ€™m basically smelling a glass of filtered water. Some light honey, to be extremely charitable. Very watery with just a bit of honey and gentle spice.

Boulder Creek Redwood Ale;Boulder Creek, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Creek Brewing Company;From sampler at the brewpub, 28/10/13. Lacy beige collar on clear ruby. Good juicy redcurrant nose with grenadine splashes. Earthy base under old cranberry sauce, hints of dankness and rust. good nutty backdrop.

Boulder Creek Redwood Ale;Boulder Creek, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Creek Brewing Company;Draught at the Surfrider Cafe. Dull dark amber-brown color with a small head. Floral piney hop aroma with some caramel and bread squeaking through as well. The flavor was actually more dry and hoppy than I was expecting and had more hop character than their pale ale, with just a light crystal malt character balancing. Pretty standard cascade profile in the hops overall, and Iâ€™m not the biggest fan of that, though I can see how older drinkers might enjoy it more. Light to medium body. Not really great in its balance, but decent stuff and pleasantly lacking in sticky caramel.
Boulder Creek Redwood Ale;Boulder Creek, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Creek Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Pours reddish amber with a small off-white head. Aroma is caramel malt, some fresh orange, and some light hops. Flavor is the same, maybe with a bit of spruce or pine. A malt-heavy amber with some interesting flavors.
Boulder Creek Redwood Ale;Boulder Creek, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Creek Brewing Company;I am not a fan of this brewery but this is one of their least offensive beers. Pours a nice reddish color. Has a mild aroma of some caramel and maybe a bit of hops (could be my imagination). Flavor is bland and dry. Finishes clean.
Boulder Creek Redwood Ale;Boulder Creek, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Creek Brewing Company;Nice red color with an off whtie head. Found the beer to be a little flat for my taste. Almost like it was missing some hops. Not impressive or really note worthy. It just did not stand out for me.
Boulder Creek Redwood Ale;Boulder Creek, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Creek Brewing Company;Nice pour. Good head and decent lacing after three days in a growler. Maybe a teensie bit lighter than I'd like, but nice and clear. The flavor's very well balanced. I'm getting a much longer malt finish than hops but that's not a problem. A very nice drinking beer.

Americas Sweetness Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Americas Brewpub;Tried this one out on tap while up judging the Drunk Monk Challenge but didnâ€™t have time for good notes.
Americas Sweetness Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Americas Brewpub;Draft at Americas. Pours a dark, slightly translucent brown with a tan head. Nose is werthers original, chocolate. Tons of diacetyl/butterscotch. This renders the beer virtually undrinkable. Huge Diacetyl character and sweet, cloyingly so. Not good.
Americas Sweetness Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Americas Brewpub;On tap at the Roundhouse. Pint served a black/brown color with a quickly diminishing, off white head, and sparse lacing. The aroma gave off roasty notes, coffee, malt and sweetness. The flavor supported these with an even hop bitterness, and a medium dry finish. The wheat didnâ€™t seem to help the head retention, but appeared to give the body some fullness.
Americas Sweetness Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Americas Brewpub;On tap at the brewpub on 6/20/07: Pours a barely transparent dark mahogany with a thin, spotty-lacing tan head. Aroma of lightly sweet dark caramel malt. Body starts a little thin for the style with some malt sugars, light soapiness and some lingering roasted bitterness toward the finish. An average stout.

Americas Sweetness Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Americas Brewpub;(Tap) Pours a inky black color with not much in the way of head. Sweet, roasted aroma. Flavor is relatively smooth, with coffee and burnt grain notes. Mouthfeel is not particularly strong, with a distinct lactose ending. Body is a little bit too thin for the style.
Americas Sweetness Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Americas Brewpub;Big cocoa nose...almost to the point of artificiality. The pour was a flat looking dark brown with a thin residue of a dishwater-type head, The flavor and texture were flat and boring. Cocoa again...artificial tasting and forced, with some nutts, roated grain, and coffee. The texture was very, very watery and insubstantial.
Americas Sweetness Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Americas Brewpub;On tap pours a dark brown with a tan ring of a head. Bakers chocolate in the aroma and flavor. Finishes with chocolate. Thatâ€™s about it. Not too bad but nothing special.
Americas Golden Light;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Americas Brewpub;On tap at the brewpub bar after the 12th Annual Drunk Monk Competition. The tap handle said Golden Ale, but there was tape blocking some initial wording. Mike described it as a lightly hopped Blonde Ale and told me the ingredients, so Iâ€™m going with the Golden Light label. He also disclosed that this was the base beer for the Chocolate Ale. The pint pour was a clear, golden amber, with modest, white foam to a head that diminished rather quickly to a pencil thin ring and light film, and left some light ribbons of lacing. The aroma was light malt, a touch of yeast, light mid-fruit, and a slight hint of banana. The flavor notes were a lighter version of the aromaâ€™s, and in combination with low carbonation, gave off a somewhat thin and watery nature. But as a light ale, still a refreshing and sessionable brew.
Americas Golden Light;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Americas Brewpub;a decent light beer if there is such a thing. i got the sampler at americaâ€™s brewpub and this was one of the five 5 ounce brews that they brought me. i chugged it(all 5 ounces!) because that is the purpose of light beer. and this was far better tasting and fresher than any macro light or lite beer
Anderson Valley Centennial Ale;Boonville, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;On draft at Tap 25. It pours clear yellow with a white head. The aroma is very citrusy with lemon, grapefruit and florals with some light notes of pilsner malts. Clean. The flavor is very floral and strongly bitter with clean pilsner maltiness. Lemon peel. Fresh and clean, but a bit too bitter.
Adler Brau Eagle Lager;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;This beer had some odd citrus and spice tones which I did not expect. This brewery does something weird with their yeast it seems, as everything has unexpected flavors. Pretty good for a plain old American-style lager.
Adler Brau Eagle Lager;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Golden color with a quick vanishing bright white head. Sweet lemon yeasty and malt aroma. Light lemon hops flavors along with mild malt. Has almost a belgium yeast quality that throws some of the flavors askew.
Adler Brau Fox Classic River Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Light, watery body but some decent hop flavors. Probably their hoppiest beer. I enjoyed drinking this beer.
Adler Brau Fox Classic River Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Copper colored with a minimal head, a grapefruit aroma with some cinnamon/ginger spiciness. Dry and a bit toasty, hoppy and malt stingy with a decent bitter finish. Bottled version, mediocre, but the restaurant downstairs from the brewery is worth a try if you're in Appleton IMO. Lots on tap.
Adler Brau Fox Classic River Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Slightly hazy light amber color with a modest light cream head. Burnt hops aroma. Thin feel. Mild malt flavors with hops flavor and bitterness. Really lacks a malt backbone and body.
Adler Brau Tailgate Amber;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Another odd beer, probably due to the yeast. Kinda bland, like a lot of their standard style beers. I donâ€™t have much else to say other than that it was very average and boring.
Adler Brau Tailgate Amber;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Light amber with a quickly diminishing fizzy head. Aroma of yeast and light caramel. Flavors of light malt and funky yeast, almost a belgium yeast characteristic. Interesting but weird.
Barley Brothers Tripppleberrry Wheat;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley Brothers Brewery and Grill;Draft at the source. Pours a murky yellow hue with a white head. Aroma of dark berries. Taste is raspberry and blueberry mixed with a blonde ale.
Barley Brothers Tripppleberrry Wheat;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley Brothers Brewery and Grill;A bit more wheat than berry in the aroma. But a lot more berry in the flavor, primarily blueberry. A bit too fruity for my tastes but certainly not a bad beer.

Barley Brothers Tripppleberrry Wheat;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley Brothers Brewery and Grill;Took a trip with the family and landed here for dinner. I researched the beer scene before leaving so it wasnâ€™t a total surprise for me. This beer was delicious. The fruit aroma was pleasant with rasberries and then cranberries. I picked up the blueberry in my first taste. Well balanced, easy to drink, and a definite stop next time I am in Havasu. Had the Calzone. Outstanding.
Barley Brothers Tripppleberrry Wheat;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley Brothers Brewery and Grill;A: Incredibly cloudy golden brown color with a frothy white head. S: The name is very appropriate. Sweet berry aromas, especially the raspberries and blueberries. There might be a hint of the cranberries with a slight tartness. T: The berries give an almost candy-like blended berry flavor, but I actually find it to be fairly enjoyable. Like the aroma, the raspberries and blueberries are the most pronounced. M: Medium body with fairly moderate carbonation, considering the probably carbonation loss in transit from AZ to CA. D: I found the berry sweetness to be enjoyable, but it is something that is tough to drink a lot of (for me, anyway).
Barley Brothers Tripppleberrry Wheat;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley Brothers Brewery and Grill;Hazed gold with creamy tight white head and lace.

Barley Brothers Tripppleberrry Wheat;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley Brothers Brewery and Grill;Personally I feel that this is the best American wheat style fruit beer that I have had. Everytime I go to Havasu I go to Barley Brothers and get a growler of this. Given, I am usually with my lady, and she likes it alot, I still really enjoy it. These guys really make some nice fruit beers. Aroma is like fruit candy. Perhaps a little bit of the Skittles purple pack. Pours cloudy yellowish hefe color with some berry colored hue. Flavor is exactly the same. Though not really artificial tasting. The fruit dominates the wheat. It is smooth and drinkable. Not too sweet. Extremely pleasant.

It came with a wedge of lime which I discarded. Has a faint aroma of malt sweetness and a bit fruity, probably from the lime wedge. Taste consists of a mild sweetness and just a faint trace of bitterness. Has a dry finish. Light body, smooth but sort of bland. Decent drinker as it goes down easy. Would make a nice session beer. I guess the lime is to hide a bit of the blandness.

John Harvards Cherry Wheat;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at JH - Wayne, PA... Appears a semi-transparent haze of pale gold with a small white head of foam that quickly fades away. Tiny speckles of lace quickly slip back down into the average sized collar. Smell is of some tart wheat, lemons, perhaps a tiny dollop of cherry...albeit I wouldâ€™ve never guessed thatâ€™s what it was had I not been shown the beer had 44 lbs of cherries added. Power of suggestion? Smells like a typical American Wheat to me. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a hay like presence, along with a doughy yeast lingering. Mouthfeel is light bodied, mildly tart and bitter with a lip smacking sweet tartness.
John Harvards Cherry Wheat;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Draught at Monroeville. Very weak aroma. A bit of cherry fruitiness but overall very weak. Light malt sweetness and cherry skin tartness. Hazy orange-amber with thin white lacing head. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Starts with little character, mild carbonic acidity. Has mild cherry notes at first then the hops kick in and Iâ€™m left with a light astringent chalkiness. Watery weak finish and mild wheatiness.
John Harvards Cherry Wheat;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Pours hazy golden pink with aroma of hopcit, wheat, cherries, lemongrass. Tastes of hopcit and cherry, with a half decent complexity.
John Harvards Cherry Wheat;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);DC - Draft. Clear pinkish amber, thin white fizzy head. Nice nose on this one with a grassy, cherry pie, wheaty thing going on. Was told it was a 50/50 blend of sour and standard cherry, and that seems to come out nicely in the flavor. Somewhat tart with a very light sweetness up front, but blended nicely with the wheat and light hop notes in the end. Light bodied, prickly carbonation, tart cherry finish. Nice lawnmower session brew for the spring and summer...
John Harvards Cherry Wheat;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);A nice light change. A wheat beer with a nice cherry flavor. Definatly a good trip to Harvards!

Bartrams Captains Stout;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Stout;Bartrams;Bottled. A hazy deep red beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet malty with primary notes of caramel, but also a burnt edge. The flavor is sweetmlaty with a slight acidicy from hard roaste malt, as well as lighter notes of vegetables and soy sauce, leading to a dry finish with notes of hard roasted malt.

Bartrams Captains Stout;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Stout;Bartrams;Bottle, thx to fonefan. It pours a dark brown body with a quite small beige head. Toffeish and butterscotchy with notes of coffee-grit. Sweetish in a way, but still very dry, with flavors of toffee, butterscotch, some dried fruits, a little sourness and a distinct coffee-like bitterness. Surely not my cup of tea. I ilke both dry and sweet stouts, but Iâ€™m not very fond of butterscotch in my beers. And a tad more fruityness wouldnâ€™t hurt either. (080822)

Breadish, chocolate and mild spiced aroma. Flavour is mild citric to a breadish and chocolate malty base flavour. Lingering bitter chocolate and roasted acidic finish. Perhaps a mild infection, but not one that does much harm.
Burg Kerstdubbel;Ermelo, Netherlands;Dubbel;Burg Bieren;Free sample from tap at the brewery to celebrate the new year. The alcohol percentage is a guess, there was no mention of it at the brewery tap inside the store. Full bodied, fairly yeasty beer. Very malty with lots of cherry fruit and just a hint of roasted malt in the flavor. Upcoming sourness.
De Brouwers Grand Place Ale;Bruxelles, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place;Draught at the breweryâ€™s premises in 2007, sold there at the time as Grand Place AmbrÃ©e. Orange blond, pale-ale like beer with caramel and very nutty malt character, dried fruits, thin and almost watery mouthfeel, grassy hops in the finish. More reminiscent of an English bitter than a true Belgian amber ale.
De Brouwers Grand Place Ale;Bruxelles, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place;Draught @ The Brewpub. Rated on 19.07.2010 Rather light and somewhat fresh aroma with some fruitiness. Flavour is also very light with some fruits and slight hoppiness. Thin palate. Too thin and light, easy to forget.

Bieckert Africana;LujÃ¡n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;CervecerÃ­a LujÃ¡n (CCU Argentina);Bieckert Africana Negra Premium. Big bottle. Black clear colour with an average beige head. Aroma of sweet caramel, coffee, roasted malt. Mild smooth flavour of sweet caramel, roasted malts, bit chocolate and dry finish. A pretty good brew!

Bieckert Africana;LujÃ¡n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;CervecerÃ­a LujÃ¡n (CCU Argentina);Nothing memorable about it. A fairly bad try at a comercial bock. For the brown hints in the head, I presume this beer is artificialy colored. Pretty mediocre stuff and now hard to come by. Malty as usual, with no aroma or flavor whatsoever.
Bieckert Africana;LujÃ¡n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;CervecerÃ­a LujÃ¡n (CCU Argentina);Imbibed in December 2002.

Bieckert Africana;LujÃ¡n, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;CervecerÃ­a LujÃ¡n (CCU Argentina);Surprisingly good for a mass produced south american bock. Needs a little more body and complexity of flavour to really set it apart. Mild caramel/choc flavours make it pleasantly easy to drink.

De Brouwers Brussels White (Blanche);Bruxelles, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place;"Standard witbier, used to be sold as Grand Place Blanche at the brewpub, with a moussy, not very stable head and cloudy straw blonde colour; barley sweetness with sourish wheat and a lot of coriander.

De Brouwers Brussels White (Blanche);Bruxelles, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place;Location: Had this one at some Restaurant in NYC, Late April 2010 Aroma: Lots of yeast on the nose, with some fruitiness as well Appearance: Fairly typical appearance for the style, hazy golden color Flavor: Taste is also rather yeasty, with some spice and fruity sweetness Palate: The body is light-medium, an alright body, drinkable enough Overall Impression: This is a fairly mediocre Belgian White overall. Not a whole lot going on here to make it a stand-out in the style. A boring white.

De Brouwers Brussels White (Blanche);Bruxelles, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place;Sample at Buckeye Beer Engine. The beer is a hazy yellow color with a thick and fizzy white head that burns down to a film relatively fast. Stringy lacing on the glass. Spiced aroma with some banana notes. Light body with flavors of sweet fruit and spices, plus a touch of wheat. The finish is mostly banana with a bit of coriander up front, and leaves a short citrus aftertaste. Barely average overall.
De Brouwers Brussels White (Blanche);Bruxelles, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place;Grand Place, Brussels, B. On tap Pale yellow with small head. Aroma of citrus and koriander seed. Flavor is wheat and lemon with high carbonation.
De Brouwers Brussels White (Blanche);Bruxelles, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place;Enjoyed in a bottle at Audobon in Boston. OK for the style. There are other brewers that do a much nicer job here, but this is certainly a drinkable wit. Pours a very pale yellow. Looks very much like a Hoegaarden. Strong citrus aroma, very lemony. Fairly bland on the palate. Decent and thirst-quenching, but not an all-time favorite.

Schneider Negra Stout (Argentina);Santa FÃ©, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Cerveceria Santa FÃ© (CCU Argentina);"Lo admito, de las variedades que sacÃ³ Schneider al mercado, esta es sin ninguna duda, la que mÃ¡s me gustÃ³. En mi percepciÃ³n se nota muchÃ­simo el gusto de la malta tostada y un claro gusto a cafÃ©. Al igual que lo que notÃ© con la ""variedad"" roja, el gusto del lÃºpulo es muy suave. Buena espuma y buena carbonataciÃ³n en este caso. En general, es una buena cerveza para ser industrial"

Schneider Negra Stout (Argentina);Santa FÃ©, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Cerveceria Santa FÃ© (CCU Argentina);Definitely better than Quilmes stout but there isnâ€™t a lot more going on here. Itâ€™s dark, at least in colour, and...nevermind.

Schneider Negra Stout (Argentina);Santa FÃ©, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Cerveceria Santa FÃ© (CCU Argentina);"Poured this beer from a litro into a beer mug. The beer had a dark brown color with a slight dark red hue and a big bubbly, creamy dark tan head that had good retention and some cling. The aroma featured chocolate and caramel malt, along with some earthy and grainy hops. The taste was sweet with a bit of chocolate and some grainy bitterness following. It had a fairly wet but not too thick body with average to low carbonation and a dry finish. My girlfriend begged me to write that she thinks it ""smells like vomit."""

Taylor Raspberry Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Taylor Brewing Company;At the Lombard brewpub. Just a hint of Raspberry. This sort of beer is not really my thing but strangely it worked better than I thought. Serving: Tap
Taylor Raspberry Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Taylor Brewing Company;On tap at Taylor Brewing. Poured crystal-clear lighter golden with very little white head.. some sticky lacing. The aroma was quite sweet with raspberry seeds and light vegetal mash.. a little warmth brought about a whole bunch of almost unbearable fruity sweetness. In the flavor department, raspberries made themselves inconvenient in almost every way possible.. tart where they shouldnâ€™t have been, lingering on the finish, and sweeter than need be.. tart wheat and vegetal notes stuck with the misplaced seeds on the finish. Light-bodied, highly-carbonated, and poorly balanced on the palate.. very hard to drink.
Taylor Raspberry Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Taylor Brewing Company;Pour is clear golden yellow with a thin white head...smells like raspberry syrup...taste is syrupy sweet raspberry...blech.
Taylor Raspberry Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Taylor Brewing Company;Clear raspberries in the aroma. Cloudy gold color without much head. What is there is thin and off-white. Streak lace. Some bubbles. Initial mouthfeel is favorable. Wheat and raspberry are evident. A little sour. Sometimes fruit beers are overly sweet and usually it isnâ€™t intended. This isnâ€™t a bad beer, and is closer to good than most of the brews in the 6-beer sampler.
Taylor Raspberry Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Taylor Brewing Company;Contract brewed by Two Brothers Brewing Company, Warrenville, IL Amber-colored. Intriguing aromas were not only raspberry, but held a defined pumpkin flesh, a touch of melon and a fresh, green-vegetable essence. The flavor, too, was not overwhelmingly fruity, revealing that it sat on a stable, wheat base. Flat presence and rather thin. For a brewpub fruit beer, this wasnâ€™t too bad. On tap at Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor Raspberry Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Taylor Brewing Company;"No notable color for a ""berry"" beer, golden. Some hint of raspberry on the nose, and in the flavor. No notable beer flavor, finishes fresh and crisp."
Taylor Raspberry Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Taylor Brewing Company;Had this one on draught in Lombard, Illinois. Finally, a respectable raspberry wheat! Light orange color, very pronounced raspberries in the nose with some apple. Tart raspberries in the taste -- like berries right off the tree, complete with the sensation that you probably should be getting seeds in your teeth. Tart, not sweet (finally!) and not too sour. Respectable wheaty taste in the finish. Good.
Taylor Raspberry Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Taylor Brewing Company;you can really taste the rasberries in this one. but it is a nice flavor and is still quite drinkable. but i could see how the almost artificial tasting raspberry taste could get kind of old in a full pint. i enjoyed this as part of the 6 beer sampler.
Taylor Raspberry Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Taylor Brewing Company;Iâ€™m not usually a fruit beer fan, and this is why. The raspberry totally overpowers any hint that thereâ€™s a wheat bear beneath it. Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor Raspberry Wheat;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Taylor Brewing Company;i noticed more of a raspberry taste then previous raters of this brew. but there really wasnâ€™t much else to it but the hints of rapsberry. better served as, say, a raspberry tea than a beer. not horrid, but definitly nothing to pine after.
Taylor Nut Brown Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;On tap at Taylor Brewing. Poured clear, garnety-amber with a short cap of whitish head. The aroma picked up sweeter, lightly-roasted dark fruity and caramel notes with too much sweetness.. blocked out what hoppage may have been there. The flavor was sweet with darker, in-your-face chocolate and fruity sweetness.. light, prickly fruit and something I couldnâ€™t identify for dark bitterness.. long impression on the finish.. kind of unnerving. Slightly less than medium-bodied on the palate with higher carbonation.. tacky, ugly impression on the finish.
Taylor Nut Brown Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;Pour is clear amber brown with a thin tan head...smell is lightly toasty and sweet...taste is lightly nutty and sweet...also grainy and thin...
Taylor Nut Brown Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;Draft sampler. By sticking to the stuff made by Capital or Two Brothers, Iâ€™m finding some godd beers at this placeâ€¦ regrettably, their own brews keep running out. This does have a dark roast malt to it, just a touch of porter to keep it going, with a large set of English hops, maybe more than a Brown should have. Actually feels best at the aftertaste.
Taylor Nut Brown Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;Contract brewed by Capital Brewery, Middleton, WI A weakly-hazed sepia without much of a head.

Taylor Nut Brown Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;Pours a clear, light brown color with a slight tan head.

Taylor Papas Porter;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Porter;Taylor Brewing Company;Pour is black with a thin tan head...smell is lightly roasty...very thin and sweet mouthfeel and flavor...surprise: blech...
Taylor Papas Porter;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Porter;Taylor Brewing Company;Sweet roasted malt aroma with coffee notes. Opaque black color with a tan head the color of Guinness. Immediately detected something off in the flavor. Detergent, thin, tainted.
Taylor Papas Porter;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Porter;Taylor Brewing Company;This had a deep brown, thick pour with very little of a tan head. The aroma was smoky and sweet, roasty, a touch of maple and a daub of chocolate. Watery, to be sure. Light roasted malt flavor with a slightly sour nip in the finish. The brewer mustâ€™ve been angry with his papa. Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor Papas Porter;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Porter;Taylor Brewing Company;"Pours deep ruby/black with a thin, tan skin & halo.

My ""papa"" wouldâ€™ve boxed my ears if I served him one of these. On tap at Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL 60148"
Taylor Papas Porter;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Porter;Taylor Brewing Company;Thick, dark, and sweet. One of my favorite local-brew stout/porters. Not much nose to it, though.
Taylor Papas Porter;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Porter;Taylor Brewing Company;This my favorite of the 8 samples I tried. Black in color. Small tan head. Aroma and taste is strong in maple. Very low roasted character for a porter. A little on the sweet side, but a decent beer.
Taylor Banter Blonde Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;Brewed On Premesis Clear, golden and headless. I sent this back because it tasted like bleach and I thought it was the glass. No... customers have been complaining about this one... itâ€™s the beer!!!! A responsible brewer would kill the batch rather than serve it out, but who am I to comment? Also held a hint of nuts and slight grains. Bleachy flavor. A real palate cleanser (or maybe a kitchen cleanser?) I would re-rate this at another time, but Iâ€™m pissed that they both served this to me and charged me for it if they knew it was off. Irresponsible. On tap at Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor Banter Blonde Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;not a whole lot here. this seems to be an attempt to please the crowds at this brewpub. i must say that it is probably the most macro friendly brew pub i have ever been to. they have bud and bud light on tap for some reason??? but this would be an excellent substitute for a light beer drinker, but not really recommmended for a craft beer enthusiast.
Taylor Banter Blonde Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;This poured a straw-yellow color with a modest head. The aroma is sweet and fruity. Itâ€™s a watery drink, not much flavor but some sweet malts. I really didnâ€™t detect much in the way of hops. Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor Banter Blonde Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;poured a light golden color. nose was bit yeasty with slight fruits also. taste was light but nice and crisp. really enjoyed this brew.
Taylor Pure Pilsner;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taylor Brewing Company;Draft. Dark yellow color. Small head. Aroma of grains and grass. Lite flavor. Lite body. Grainy flavors. Drinkable but missing flavor. Blahh.
Taylor Pure Pilsner;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taylor Brewing Company;At the Lombard brewpub. I was surprised by this one. It was on the sweet side. More Heineken than crisp like other pilsners but it kind of worked. Serving: Tap
Taylor Pure Pilsner;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taylor Brewing Company;On tap at Taylor Brewing. Poured clear, not-much-more-than-watery golden with rising carbonation and zero head. The aroma picked up very soft grainy and bready notes with light lemon zest and hay.. OK, but very weak. The flavor had just a touch more substance than the nose.. grassy notes over a honey and sweet bready core.. the back found dry lemon zest.. not much going on. Watery, dry, and grainy on the palate with a short finish.. unsubstantial.
Taylor Pure Pilsner;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taylor Brewing Company;Pour is clear golden yellow with a thin white head...smell is lightly sweet and grassy and grainy...thin sweet flavor...cloyingly sweet...
Taylor Pure Pilsner;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taylor Brewing Company;"Actually has an aroma which is not something many of Taylorâ€™s beers have. Sweet banana aroma; candied like those youâ€™ll find in Brazil. Very slightly hazy light gold with a white, frothy head and some lace. Very light flavor, with none of the candied banana coming through at all. Perhaps as good as or sligthly better than the average brewpub pils, but basically devoid of flavor."
Taylor Pure Pilsner;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taylor Brewing Company;Draught during my Great Lakes region brew tour. After browsing the menu and seeing nothing at all that grabs my attention, I make some illogical decision to order, consume, then pay money for this. Pours yellow with a large white head. The faint aroma is malty with corn husk and paper notes. A little hoppiness comes out in the mouth which is mostly just flat and predictable. I think I detect some mulch flavor. Pretty lame brew.
Taylor Pure Pilsner;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taylor Brewing Company;Contract brewed by Capital Brewery, Middleton, WI Medium-golden and headless with a fairly flat body. Weak aroma was herbal bitter. Flavor was crisp and true to style, finishing on a nice, bitter note. Aftertaste lasted and was pleasant. One of the better beers here. On tap at Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor Pure Pilsner;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taylor Brewing Company;Another Taylor without much of an aroma (or have I just blown out my olfacotory sense on IPAs and Stouts?). Unlike most Pils, no aftertaste, very mild. Clear golden color.
Taylor Pure Pilsner;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taylor Brewing Company;Had this one on draught in Lombard, Illinois. Perhaps the best pils Iâ€™ve had, which isnâ€™t saying a lot, but this still wasnâ€™t too bad. Medium yellow and clear appearance, hoppy nose, clean finish, very similar taste to a pale ale.
Taylor Pure Pilsner;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taylor Brewing Company;I enjoyed this one. not a bad choice if looking for something on the lighter side. i liked this better than their golden ale.
Taylor Golden Diamond;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;Had at the brewpub in Lombard. Not very exciting Golden Ale. Rather sweet a little watery. Serving: Tap
Taylor Golden Diamond;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;"Pint draft. In its shaker, it looks like any other ordinary beer; something light to go with my Poblano burger. Light amber color with a thin layer of foam. Malty and fruity smell. Taste is at least okay, like a decent homebrew. Some basic hop balance, probably Cascades. Shows rather a lack of brewing ambition, even in their contract brews from Capital. Standard."
Taylor Golden Diamond;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;On tap at Taylor Brewing. Poured clear, bright golden with a short-lived sticky cap of white head. The aroma picked up artificially-sweetened honey and spicy fruit.. quite sweet overall and not very interesting. The flavor found sweeter honey and floral notes with a grainy, very sweet finish.. some toffee and more fruit with warmth.. meh. Sticky and sweet on the palate with a lighter body.. long, non-offensive but non-enjoyable finish.
Taylor Golden Diamond;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;Contract brewed by Capital Brewery, Middleton, WI Middle-of-the-road golden with a creamy white and holding head. No distinctive aromas save a touch of grain and grassy hop. Light bitterness in flavor with a thin mouthfeel. Sub par. On tap at Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor Golden Diamond;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;This poured a golden color with good carbonation and a fizzy white head. It smells very sweet, almost candy-like. Itâ€™s watery in the mouth, but delivers a sweet malt taste with a dash of bitterness in the finish. Not too bad. Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor Golden Diamond;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;This beer has a very nice balance. The first taste is very sweet, then a slight was of hops across the middles of the tongue, then the sweet returns. Definitely a nicely drinkable beer.
Taylor Cream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Cream Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;On tap at Taylor Brewing. Poured clear bright golden with a short, sticky cap of white head. The aroma was sweet with toffee, caramel, and butterscotch represented.. spritzy, vegetal undertones. The flavor found sweet honey, toffee, and butterscotch with light herbal and piney accents.. too sweet, and not a tasty sweetness.. I did not like the components. Creamy and buttery on the palate.. paired with my notes above, made this very difficult to swallow.
Taylor Cream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Cream Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;"Draft. Still made by Two Brothers. Golden lagery body under a thin head. A nice light malty smell. Light ale taste with smoothed over malts. No more than a basic hop balance with some spice poking out of the bitterness. Pleasing enough session beer; a not-thrilling example of a not-thrilling style., but good with Taylorâ€™s happy hour bowl of popcorn."
Taylor Cream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Cream Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;Contract brewed by Two Brothers Brewing Company, Warrenville, IL Pure golden with a slight head and a hint of carbonation. A touch of vinegar in aroma that is otherwise nutty buttercream... all in all, rather like a sour cream soda (not offensive, though). Flavor was bitter and nutty, hearty & roasted. Not bad. On tap at Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor Cream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Cream Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;Sooo bad. Not creamy, very acidic - almost sour, is it a lambic? Skunk! Maybe theyâ€™ve got a bad tap or something. Was sitting at a table of 5 other beer fans - everyone tasted it and said the same thing - we sent it back. Guess I should try it again just to see if we had a bad batch - but Iâ€™m too scared to. Yuck!
Taylor Cream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Cream Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;Best thing about this one is the smooth creamy mouthfeel...almost buttery. But, as everyone else pointed out, this has a lot more spritz to it than advertised. Decent enough cream ale.
Taylor Cream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Cream Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;A nice drink, having more carbonation than they advertize... enough to tickle the throat going down. Good taste after a nice mouth fill. Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor Cream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Cream Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;Easily drinkable faint citrus flavour, kind of creamy as well, but almost acidic. Very carbonated which ads to the acidic kind of feel.
Taylor Cream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Cream Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;Nose like a stale sock. Burnt melting plastic heaped on an extinguished campfire. Artificial. Sort of tastes like an Oreo/Twinkie type of thing going on. Smooth.
Taylor Cream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Cream Ale;Taylor Brewing Company;Orangey/tan with thin head and very lively carbonation. Not much at all in the nose. Carbonation added to the grainy taste and effect on my tonue. Tastes as if from a can, metallic and strange.
Taylor Winterfest;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Taylor Brewing Company;"On tap at the brewpub: Not sure why this is listed as a Bitter. Not sure what else to call it. The well trained staff member said it was ""kinda like a lager."" It had a clear copper body with a respectable head and evenly coated the glass with lace. The aroma was a nondescript, worty scent, quite sweet and unchecked. The flavor is a maltose sweetness with a candy apple finish."
Taylor Winterfest;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Taylor Brewing Company;Pour clear amber with a thin white head...smell is faintly toasty and sweet...taste is thin and sweet...slightly metallic...
Taylor Winterfest;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Taylor Brewing Company;Draft Sampler. Contact brewed by Capital (Wisconsin). Yes, a nice orange, with a light head. Really does have a pile of malts to it as advertised. Hops manage to balance it and keep the whole thing from being too sweet, but without much hop character of their own. Rounded out toasty caramel malt, with a good alcohol burn going down.
Taylor ESB;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Taylor Brewing Company;Brewed On Premesis Orange/brown in color, very clear with a honey glow. Weak aroma was light bitters with rye & grain. Sweet malts and bitters combine nicely in flavor. Enjoyable. On tap at Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor ESB;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Taylor Brewing Company;Very deep copper with a white, thick head that does some serious lacing as one drinks. Rich malty aroma with a creamy mouthfeel, this leans a bit too much towards the malt side of the equation. Tasty hops, but a little light. Good drink. Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor ESB;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Taylor Brewing Company;one of the better offerings of the sampler at taylors. smooth and balanced with more body than the other taylor brews i tried. nice.
Taylor Dark Satin;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Taylor Brewing Company;Draft. Dark copper color. Ave head. Grainy malt aroma. Lite bitter and lite sweetness. Lite bodied. Kind of light and abrupt. Slite caramel flavor. Easy drinking. Not much at all going on here. Very slight hop kick at end. Boring.
Taylor Dark Satin;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Taylor Brewing Company;At the Lombard brewpub. Not great but liked it better than some other offerings. Caramel flavors a bit unbalanced. Serving: Tap
Taylor Dark Satin;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Taylor Brewing Company;This draft brew from a restaurant poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized bubbles that were and left behind a transparent softly carbonated red brown colored body and an excellent lacing. The mild aroma was malty and toffee. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a mellow hoppy aftertaste. The thin flavor contained notes of brown malt toffee and softly acidic. An OK brew just nothing special.
Taylor Dark Satin;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Taylor Brewing Company;On tap at Taylor Brewing. Poured not-too-dark coppery-brown with a creamy cap of beige head. The aroma was sweeter with medium-to-darker skinned fruits, caramel, and light nuttiness.. supa-sweet chocolate, pine, and earthy undertones.. OK. The flavor found sweeter, aged caramel with excellent smoked nutty undertones that built as the drink progressed.. light earthy bitterness surrounded.. sticky-sweet finish with some warmth. Medium-bodied and well-carbonated with a drier, grainy feel on the back.. nicely-integrated light sour and smoky notes. Good one.
Taylor Dark Satin;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Taylor Brewing Company;No aroma. Dark, reddish amber. Beautiful, artistic, net lace. Nice color. Astringent mouthfeel. Some roasted malt aspect but overall this brew wants to be more than it is. Flawed.
Taylor Dark Satin;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Taylor Brewing Company;Contract brewed by Capital Brewery, Middleton, WI Brown-colored with a honey-gold aura. Aroma was vinegar with red wine. Flavor was straight malt-vinegar when warm, with slight grain and candy when it was colder. Slightly nutty with an oily finish. I warmed up to this one after awhile, but Iâ€™d recommend it as a salad dressing or condiment rather than a beer. On tap at Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor Dark Satin;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Taylor Brewing Company;Draft. Iâ€™m celebrating my birthday today by checking out a new-to-me pub, about half a mile from work. This beer is a nice dark brown color under a light-colored stoutie head, and with pinprick bubbles up the side of the glass. Has a nice chewy dark beer texture, almost like thereâ€™s some oatmeal in it. The smell and taste resolve to a more familiar wheat beer character. There is some roastiness, too, but itâ€™s relative mild. Then it follows with a slight banana aftertaste. Intersting combination of Guinness and a weizen, perhaps, thatâ€™s just a little short of displaying the very best characterisitcs if either.
Taylor Dark Satin;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Taylor Brewing Company;This is a nice smooth dunkel, pouring a deep brown with reddish tints and a light tan head. Sweet malty, candy-like aroma. Smooth mouthfeel with the multiple malt complexity coming through nicely, toffee & caramal & roasted malt. Nice mildly bitter finish to balance it out. Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL
Taylor Dark Satin;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Taylor Brewing Company;This is a tasty example of a dunkel. It has some nicely complex flavors, with the darker roasted malts being highly dominant. It doesn't quite have the chocolate or burnt flavors one might expect.
Taylor Dark Satin;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Taylor Brewing Company;Dark brown color. Sweet malt, caramel, toffee flavors. The nose oddly reminds me of an inflatable pool device.
Marietta McLaren's Scotch Ale;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Marietta Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub, 7/15/14. Pours a clear copper color with a thin creamy tan head. Decent head retention. Aroma of peat smoke and caramel.. The taste is toffee, peat, mild smoke and a fruity finish. Medium bodied, slight lingering smoke.
Marietta McLaren's Scotch Ale;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Marietta Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub alongside one of their signature burgers. The smell consisted of malty, caramel-ness, with a slight chocolaty whiskey. The color brown like a glass of sweet tea would be but with a half inch off white head. The taste is where you really notice the caramel and malt and the after taste only re-enforces it. Overall, I would recommend that anybody traveling through the area to stop by this brewpub and grab one of these great brews. You will not regret it.
Marietta McLaren's Scotch Ale;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Marietta Brewing Company;Day old growler from my last visit at the brewery. This is much better than their Bourbon Barrel offering, a lot more complexity and multi-dimensional. Pours a mottled, amber-brown color with a diminishing, creamy tan head and spotty lacing. Inviting aroma of plums, raisins, earthy mulch and grainy-sweet malts. Malty and smooth, this is a filling brew although not too heavy. Prominent flavors of burnt/roasted malts, toasted bread and organic peat. There is a light smoke quality coupled with mixed berries. Minor hints of chocolate and coffee are present. A heavily malt forward beer with no trace of hops. The best offering I had from MBC during my visit.
Marietta McLaren's Scotch Ale;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Marietta Brewing Company;decent scotch, very thick, doesnt seem to have a ton of alcohol, but i cant tell through the thinkness. Good stuff, my only hometown brewery now, so i must love it. I have also had the barrel aged version, but i dont see that up for rating yet.
Marietta McLaren's Scotch Ale;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Marietta Brewing Company;This was a pleasing scotch. Aromas of smoke, butterscotch, whiskey, and chocolate and carmel malts. Had a good head on its shoulders and nice, if not cloudy appearance. Reminded me a lot of Vinoâ€™s scotch ale. Flavors followed aroma adding a hint of funk to it as well.
Marietta McLaren's Scotch Ale;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Marietta Brewing Company;On draught at the brewpub. This beer pours a murky reddish-amber color with a thin off-white head that has no staying power. Spotty lacing. The aroma is smoked malt, fruit and sherry. Medium-bodied with toasted malt, fruit (red grapes) and liqueur. Alcohol is evident all the while as well. The finish is smokey and earthy malt, leaving behind a slight alcohol and hops burn. Overall this is a pretty good Scotch Ale, it is just a little uneven at times.
Marietta McLaren's Scotch Ale;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Marietta Brewing Company;On tap. Pours a dark brown color with a soapy beige colored head. Aroma is sweet malts, hint of smoke. Flavor is sweet malts, hint of smoke, perhaps some dried fruits. Palate is medium bodied, medium carbonation, finishes on the sweet side. Pretty decent.
Marietta McLaren's Scotch Ale;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Marietta Brewing Company;7/20/2007: Marietta Scotch Ale is a murky, dark amber color. The aroma is malty and a bit on the sweet side. The flavor is lightly smoky, dry, malty with a little fruitiness, and some peat. Iâ€™m not sure what the alcohol is on this one, but it isnâ€™t evident in the flavor. This beer has a medium body, but slightly thin/watery on the palate for my tastes. Not bad overall, but it seemed to be needing more malt and depth. Draught at Skipperâ€™s in Athens, Ohio during the Ohio Brew Week 2007. Rating #5 for this beer...
Marietta McLaren's Scotch Ale;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Marietta Brewing Company;Dark brown, without much head. Nutty and malty with a sour off flavor. This beer may have gone south on them.
Marietta McLaren's Scotch Ale;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Marietta Brewing Company;"Sample at the brewpub. Dark, muddy opaque brown..big molasses, whiskey and brown sugar in the aroma...smooth, peaty, with a nice late alcohol burn; sweet but very scotch-like throughout, bit of oregano and tarragon herbal goodness, with hints of blueberries and pie spice. Excellent scotch ale, and the best from this interesting little brewpub."
Brewhouse Club Rubia;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brewhouse Club;Very nice full bodied golden pilsener. Could be a whole lot closer to perfect if it didn''t taste so damn fruity. The mouthfeel was excellent until it started tasting tropical.
Brewhouse Club Negra;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Brewhouse Club;Tasted almost exactly the same as the Rubia of the same brewery. Fruity flavour with a mild hint of burnt sugar. Nowhere near the flavour I had expected for such a dark beer.
WJ King Kings Old Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Old Ale;King Beer;"Bottle - BCA - Dark Brown in colour; Red against light. Malty; roasty malts, liquorice, coffee. Hoppy; earthy hops. Fruity; sour fruits. Roast malty throughout with a pronounced sour hop/fruit edge. Decent."
WJ King Kings Old Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Old Ale;King Beer;Cask at the Le Gothiqueâ€™s Halloween Beer Festival 2013. Poured a dark brown colour with a medium beige head. Aroma of dark fruit, caramel and banana essence. A slightly sharp acidic flavour first off followed by apples and brown sugar. Finish was nutty with some cinnamon and roasted malt.
WJ King Kings Old Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Old Ale;King Beer;Cask Gravity at the Green Dragon, Croydon. It pours deep brown with a small off-white head. The nose is earth, roasty, toast, cola, dark fruit, blackcurrant and strawberry jam. The taste is bitter-sweet, dark fruit, berry, treacle, liquorice, wood and light bitterness with a dry finish. Medium body and soft carbonation. Nice fruity character. Tasty.
WJ King Kings Old Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Old Ale;King Beer;0,5l bottle @ Migration 2013. Pours very dark brown with a medium tan head. Aroma is rich sweet malts. Flavor is sweet malts and dark fruits. Quite nice.
WJ King Kings Old Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Old Ale;King Beer;[Bottle from Pallants of Arundel] Pours a deep ruby-brown with a moderate cream head. Medium carbonation - rather fizzy for the style. Plenty of smoke up front, then a good coffee base with slight liquorice hints and a light earthy bitterness. Decent flavor, but the mouthfeel is too thin and fizzy and the finish is on the short side.
WJ King Kings Old Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Old Ale;King Beer;Not quite black, but very dark red with a small bubbly head. It could easily be mistaken as a porter with its roasted malts which ooze of chocolate and coffee in both aroma and taste.
WJ King Kings Old Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Old Ale;King Beer;Cask conditioned at Merton Winter Beer Fest â€™13. Dark brown to chestnut with cream head. There is a sharp, fruitiness to this beer, quite tangy with an additional nutty flavour. Some dark roasted malt notes, coffee, chocolate in addition to liquorice. Later a slight tartness comes through. Reasonable.
WJ King Kings Old Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Old Ale;King Beer;Bottle conditioned - Aroma quite sour with some wine notes and yeast. Flavour has some full and fruity malts but also some light sourness.
WJ King Kings Old Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Old Ale;King Beer;Gravity @ Wandsworth Common Halloween Beer Festival. The pourâ€™s deep brown with a tiny off-white head. The nose is deep nutty earthiness, some chocolate and sweet syrup. Toasted brown bread and caramel. The taste is toasted leafy tobacco, some prune and dark fruits. A bit of spiced pumpkin cake and runny toffee. Chocolate malts. Medium body, smooth. Overall, a fairly flavorful effort. Solid stuff.
WJ King Kings Old Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Old Ale;King Beer;Dark brown verging on black with a tan head. Roasted malt, smokiness and coffee with a slight, but not unpleasant, hint of sour fruitiness peeking through. Really enjoyable beer and a good example of the style.
WJ King Merry Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;King Beer;Gravity Dispense at Pigâ€™s Ear BF, London - 05/12/12. Lightly hazed dark amber, head soon clears to nothing. Nose is light roast malt, booze, dark toffee, light vinegar and wood. Taste follows on, dark malt, toffee, a little sugars, touch better flavours than nose. Medium bodied with soft carbonation leading to a dry finish. Pretty average.
WJ King Merry Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;King Beer;Cask at Pigs Ear BF 2012, London. Pours clear, ruby-gold with almost no head. Tangy fruit nose - almost sour. Mediocre flavor, medium sweet, lots of tangy, semi-ripe fruits, berries, a bit of bread. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Sweet, tangy finish, big tangy berries, sugary toasted malts. Erm...OK...meh. Seems like a very average beer not in top shape.
WJ King Merry Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;King Beer;From cask at Bishops Arms. Pours clear and golden amber with a fully gone head. Aroma is smooth fruity and caramelish. Sweet, overripe fruity and light caramelish. Sweet and lingering overripe fruity finish. Plums and prunes. Cinnamon and almost nutmeg spiced.

WJ King Merry Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;King Beer;Cask (gravity dispense) at the Pigs Ear Beer Festival, London on 6 December 2006. Quite attractive bright copper colour but rather low on condition. Fruity aroma. More fruit on the palate, slightly estery, with perhaps a faint tang of licorice. Some light bitterness produces a relatively firm mouthfeel. Pleasant enough but I expected a bit more imposing from a 6.5% strong ale - a bit too undemanding and easygoing.
WJ King Merry Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;King Beer;21st December 2007 Unusual. Immediate smoky note but with a zesty fruit crisp bite as well. Smooth malt and a sweet finish with a hint of spice. Lots going on here.

WJ King Merry Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;King Beer;Bottle, 6.5%. Very spicy aroma, also some roasted malts. Cloudy light brown colour. Small tan head. The flavour starts off roasted, turning rather sweet and spicy. Seems to have a bit of smoke in the finish, which might not be intended. Promising, but not so balanced.
WJ King Spring Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;King Beer;Golden with a very small head and slight fruity orange aroma. Has a mild fruitiness in its flavour and sips down easily.
WJ King Spring Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;King Beer;Real cask. Pours pale golden with a high head. Aroma is sour malts. Flavor is also slightly sour malts. Donâ€™t know if itâ€™s supposed to be like this but itâ€™s pretty decent anyway.

WJ King Spring Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;King Beer;Cask conditioned handpump Thomas Kemp Brighton. A dark copper coloured beer with an off-white head and lacing. Citrus in the nose with good hops. An interesting hop/malt balance and leafy as well as citrussy hops. I liked this. Better this year??
WJ King Spring Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;King Beer;Cask conditioned @ Hole in The Wall,Portsmouth. Musty malts with a little fruit. On the whole unimpressive and not particularly drinkable.
WJ King Spring Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;King Beer;Cask @ Oliver Twist, Stockholm. 7 June 2005. Amber and nutty aroma with a touch of old cold weak coffee. Slightly old ale/sour character. Wolly taste. Missing in hops for a spring ale, in my oppinion. Kind of artificial milky aftertaste.
WJ King Spring Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;King Beer;Enjoyed on tap at small english inn. Good amber color. Some decent malt presense. Not a bad brew but not memorable either. Still, quite drinkable.

Coqui 900;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Bottle. Gold pour with fizzy white head. Corn and hops in the nose, mild cardboard. Tastes corny malty somewhat cloying, with hops and an off-putting finish. Reminds me of MGD but not quite as cloying.
Coqui 900;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;40oz bottle a few years ago. Tasted pretty cheap but wasnâ€™t terrible. Label is a blatant st. Ides rip off.
Coqui 900;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Thanks to TheAlum! Schooly-D once told me Coqui 900 was a B-boys drink, and I have been searching for some for many years. TheAlum came through in the clutch, risking his life in the slums of Chicago to get the goods. Seriously, it isnâ€™t nearly as horrible as I had hoped. In fact, it is a pretty good malt liquor. A little corn, but overall pretty mild and unoffensive. Drinks easy, and good. If I had access to this, I would drink it fairly regularly. It is still for b-boys only. No whack ass marks like Breau.
Coqui 900;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;great crack on this one. Consumed right from the 40. Lots of grape, some dough, some grass, and just a touch of acidity. Great carbonation for the style, just a bit of bitterness. Perfect 90 degree summer porch 40.
Coqui 900;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Nearly no aroma at all. Maybe a light amount of grain. Light clear yellow color with no head. Bitter flavor not in a good way. Light palate.
Coqui 900;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Coqui 900 Premium Malt Liquor has a thick, white head and a clear, yellow appearance, with lots of bubbles streaming up. A very good amount of lacing is left behind. Aroma is a a pleasant combination of clean water and light grain (not skunked- clear bottle). The taste has a strong malt/grain/carbonation-sting backbone, with a hop kiss at the back end to balance it. The unappealing cloying sweetness once encounters with many malt liquors (especially the high gravity ones) is, thankfully, not associated with this beer. Mouthfeel is light and watery, and Coqui 900 finishes crisp and refreshing. This turned out to be much better than I expected. Itâ€™s bold and rich. Iâ€™m enjoying this 40 oz. party bottle, poured into a tasting glass. RJT
Coqui 900;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;purchased at F&G liquors, 63rd and western, chicago. even previous to this sample, i was aware that this is one of the most aromatic malt liquors ever poured to a bottle. i have seen previous samples that smelled downright like flatulence, this one did not but the initial open (a few feet from my nose) REEKED of marijuana and light sewer gas...and this is without pouring to a glass or actually trying to detect aroma. very strong. that said, once the initial blast dissipated the typical corny aroma pushes through but still with a wink of something more funky, even by malt liquor standards. even at less then absolute zero freezing (the desired serving temp for a malt of this quality) the flavor on the other hand remains somewhat crisp when you elbow the corn sludge aside but again the strange infection or whatever it is comes through and your mouth is filled with farts to varying extents. unpleasant no doubt but a roller coaster ride of a beer. potency of obnoxiousness trumps pale yellow neutral piss any day in my book.
Coqui 900;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Coqui 900 is one of the best malts around, I got this from my boy djoe800 in Philly. Minor buzz but great taste from this 40oz legend. Also known as frog piss I belive this tastes better by a mile.
Coqui 900;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;40 ounce bottle. I am slogging through this beer regretting ever having purchased even if it was just for the sole purpose of getting drunk on the cheap. NO PURCHASE ever again
Coqui 900;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;has cheap written all over it. disgusting flavor, as if it were left to sit in the sun for twenty years, which is probably what happened. Aroma smelled like someone opened King Tuts tomb. palate was left with a slimy feel.
Hops Royal English Amber;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Copper Coloring with Sandy Off White Head. Dry Hops and Grains Aroma.

Hops Royal English Amber;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Amber color with a thin head. Slight cherry aroma that is quite nice. It has a grainy taste, but more like fresh grain from the field, not something thatâ€™s been in a silo for 8 months. More berries too. This is actually pretty okay.
Hops Royal English Amber;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);I found this to be incredibly tasty. A very good amber that was slightly overhopped but that is the way I like it. Pours ... guess what amber in the color with a nice frothy head, and some great lacing. Flavor is balanced , but really hopped up with a delciate balancing act by the malts. This is without a doubt the best thing to come out of Hops.
Hops Royal English Amber;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Good malt/hop mix in the nose. Creamy, off-white head producing excellent lace. Moderately bitter and medium bodied. Good strong ESB-like flavor. A good session brew. This may be Hops' best or perhaps it just tasted that much better than the Nut Brown I had right before it.
Hops Royal English Amber;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Its a pretty looking beer and overall probably one of your best bet when going to Hops. It reminds me a bit of the sam smith pale ale but with some more body actually. Had 4 plates of bbq with a 20 oz serving of this beer. One characteristic hops has is that so far 3 of its beer has this pure grain taste...like wheat germ in it...like youre biting into a handful of fresh malt. Not much aroma, reminds me of my home brew. simple, pleasing, not terribly complex but its A OK.
Hops Royal English Amber;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);"Hazy chestnut appearance, retaining traces of a dense head. Gentle aroma, mildly fruity, not suggesting any great burst of anything, although the Golding hops come out plainly in the tasting. A bit heavily carbonated for the style. The taste diminishes into a rather hollow ""post-beer"" blasÃ©, with only bitterness to remind you from whence it came. (at Eden Prairie, MN location)"

Hubertus Pils;Laa an der Thaya, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hubertus BrÃ¤u;"getrunken im Sommer 2017 Das normale ""Hubertus Pils"" ist nicht zu verwechseln mit dem ""Hubertus Herrenpils"". Das normale Pils bekommt man normalerweise nur um Umkreis der Brauerei vom Fass. Es ist kein typisches Pils, sondern ist an den Ã¶sterreichischen Geschmack angepasst, eher ein MÃ¤rzen -zumindest geschmacklich; farblich ist es strohgelb und entwickelt eine schÃ¶ne Blume. Der recht vollmundige Geschmack lÃ¤sst ein wenig die Spritzigkeit und Frische eines Pils vermissen. Aber es bleibt ganz gut trinkbar, wenn es auch kein highlight ist."
Hubertus Pils;Laa an der Thaya, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hubertus BrÃ¤u;Tap. Aroma of malt, some corn, honey, minimal hoppy touch.

Very drinkable.
Herold Old Stork;Breznice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Pivovar Herold;Color is a dark golden-orange, darker than other pilsners I have sampled. Aroma is strong and very malty with some sharpness. Flavor is malty but not sweet, and it has a good hoppy edge but not any real bitterness. This pils is smooth but tingly, and the aftertaste has hoppy overtones. Tasty.
Herold Old Stork;Breznice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Pivovar Herold;"My Bottom Line: A somewhat fruity and dusty yeast presence roams with the prevalent maple/honey sweetness of this rather malty bohemian pilsner. If you expect a crisp and beautifully hoppy Czech pils, this might not be it. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam fades into the dull, hazy blond. -The finishing hop bitterness is quite dry and muddled, a little wooden. -This has the usual, bready sweet flavor profile of 14-degree svetlÃ©s. -Is this controlled diacetyl I perceive, or is the maltâ€™s sweetness leaking into butterscotch territory? Bottle; no date."
Herold Old Stork;Breznice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Pivovar Herold;The aroma is sweet with caramel malt, yeast, and light herbal hops. The appearance is light amber gold with a thin head. The palate this thin. This is a sweet caramel interpretation of a Bohemian Pilsner light on the hops. The aftertaste has sugar and a little bit of chemical bitterness.
Herold Old Stork;Breznice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Pivovar Herold;Pours cloudy amber with very little head that dissapates quickly. Leaves little to no lacing. Sweet malty aroma and a slightly hoppy finish. The longer I drink it the more I like it.
Herold Old Stork;Breznice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Pivovar Herold;Pours a dark gold, but not too pretty. Grain malts and bread lace about both in nose and taste. No bitter, just easy and smoothe. Very drinkable as an opener.
Herold Old Stork;Breznice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Pivovar Herold;Aroma is very hearty with grain and bread notes. Clear golden body with a lazy white head. Fore is again bready and grainy with a bit of yeasty dough sweetness. It gives it an almost ale like feel in the regard. Very mild hop bitterness in the finish and even a mild toastyness. Much better than I expected it to be.
Herold Old Stork;Breznice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Pivovar Herold;Thanks to Degarth for this one! The Stork pours with a dark yellow body that holds up a long lasting, creamy, bone-colored head. Rich bready, doughy malt aroma that is supported by a flowery hops. Slight sweetness that is balanced by a good hop bitterness underneath. A bit soapy, but there is lots of body for the style here that make this quite enjoyable.
Herold Old Stork;Breznice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Pivovar Herold;Bottle. Pours a slightly cloudy honey gold with 3/4â€ white head. Smells like caramel apples, flat out. Green Granny Smith apples. Flavor of pear juice, and...man, not much else. Little bit of malt, hint of corn. After taste like green red apple skin and just a touch of hop bitterness. Body is on the thin side, but appropriate for the light flavor of the beer. Is this even beer? This flat out the most drinkable lager Iâ€™ve ever had. Iâ€™m impressed.
Herold Old Stork;Breznice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Pivovar Herold;One of the best lagers I have had the pleasure to drink.

Bavaria Premium Draught (South Africa);Centurion Park, South Africa;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Breweries (South Africa);With Bavarian influence, brewed in South Africa by the Funk Family.

Bavaria Premium Draught (South Africa);Centurion Park, South Africa;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Breweries (South Africa);"Smells like tin, water, and alcohol. I really canâ€™t pick up anything else with my nose. Has that below average piss-yellow colour, and not a bad head. Itâ€™s got a smooth taste though, with plenty of maltiness and some hint of hops. Nonetheless itâ€™s kind of a below average brew and firmly in the ""meh"" category of beers."

Willimantic Bulk Rate Bitter;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Willimantic Brewing Company;Very very very bitter. Huge cascade aroma, with other hops I''m not familiar with. My friend got their IPA, whatever the name was, and this was far and away more bitter. It almost makes your mouth pucker. Good malts, a touch of fruitiness. I was a little disappointed, because i was hoping for a rich english bitter, but this worked just the same.

DB Double Brown;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Probably the best beer. Markets itself.

DB Double Brown;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);This is the story of how New Zealand as we know changed forever. So the story goes, one day the godâ€™s way up in the clouds were playing a game of footy. Zeus had funnelled a few too many beers and was running it straight up the guts like a true team player. But Zeus got bunced hard as, by one of the big taniwha fullas, Zeus went flying through the air and smashed into the crates of beers. One of the crates flue off the clouds falling straight down towards the mighty New Zealand. This sacred gods beer flew straight into the pool of an unsuspecting hard working man who was wearing his New Zealand summer tuxedo which consisted of jandals, stubbies and a singlet, hats and sunnies are optional. This bloke fished out this crate of beers and inspected the excellent craftmanship of the wooden crate. The huge 745ml bottles had a logo stamped on them which read DoubleBrown. He cracked on open and took a good hard swig, this was the best beer he had ever tasted. From that day on he vowed to brew this beer so the whole of New Zealand could taste its beauty. The End
Sinpalsken Winterbier;Sint-Pauwels, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Cock;"Winter edition of Sinpalsken Donker, used to be called Sinpalsken Kerstbier. Bottled in 75 cl bottles with paper wrapped around them and only made in very limited quantities (and not every winter, I assume); found this through friends who are acquainted with the brewer. Dark brown beer with thin off-white head; low carbonation and therefore smooth and very soft, almost buttery mouthfeel; malty and dried fruits, caramel, coriander, light roasted bitterishness in the finish. Interesting but more so because of its rarity than because of its actual taste."
Sinpalsken Winterbier;Sint-Pauwels, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Cock;Bottle @ Kerstbierfestival 2006 in Essen, BE. Brown color with a small white head.

Hilltop ESB;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hilltop Brewing Company;Draft at Hilltop. Copper colored. No head. No is faint with mild malts and light hops.

Hilltop ESB;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hilltop Brewing Company;The color is right lightish copper, but not much head to speak of. Minimal aroma and taste.

Nice earthy hop nose. Earthy hop bite through the middle and finish with no malt profile to complement. Body is thin and watery. Finish is bitter. This beer could really go places with some malt content and a little attention to mouthfeel/body.

Miller Special Reserve;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"I thought this was a great attempt from Miller. It did pour pretty nice with a decent white head. Golden color. There was a light but good barley malt flavor. Hopping was pretty tame. Crystal, cascade combo maybe?? Iâ€™m sure they didnâ€™t want to scare the High-Life crowd away. Drinkable, expensive...but they should have stuck with the ""special edition"" market. It helps sell the cheap beer"

Nelson Faceplant Winter Ale;Nelson, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Nelson Brewing Company (Canada);Wasnâ€™t sure what to think of this beer.

Beer Works Curley's Irish Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Beer Works;Thick oily pour, just like guineas. The rest of the beer differs from the hallmark. Watered down, more carbonation, and less robust flavor.
Beer Works Curley's Irish Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Beer Works;Poured into a mug, the appearance was a black color with a thin wisp of a white head that dissipated into oblivion leaving no lace. The aroma triggers dark chocolate, light coffee bean, roasted nuts, and a touch of cream. The flavor blends all of these previously mentioned aromas to boot. Dry rugged roasty aftertaste to finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Mild carbonation. ABV feels fine. Dry in the feel. Overall, good Irish dry stout that I could have again.

Onuma KÃ¶lsch;Onuma, Japan;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;Brauhaus Onuma;On tap at the GJBF in Osaka 2014. Clear light gold with a thin filmy head. Malty, a bit rough and too fruity in my opinion for a KÃ¶lsch. Light bodied, kind of watery. Horrible skunky hoppy flavor, yuck. Not my thing it reminds me of a light struck grolsch. Not sure what was going on here but this beer was subpar.
Onuma KÃ¶lsch;Onuma, Japan;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;Brauhaus Onuma;Bready and slightly sour. Doesnâ€™t leave too much of an impression with some sour apple and a hint of banana, but itâ€™s a decent background beer when food is at the fore.

Onuma KÃ¶lsch;Onuma, Japan;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;Brauhaus Onuma;From the can, bought right across from the brewpub, Nov 2007. A rather dark gold color for a Koelsch, quite cloudy with a medium, fine and foamy head. Moderately fragrant, aroma of yeast, malt, a touch of fruit, and some hops. Taste: Very light malt character. Slightly fruity, with a bit of yeast character, not what I would call full-flavored, though either is your average Koelsch. Hops are barely noticeable. A rather uninteresting beer, though a relatively straightforward interpretation of the style, I think. Fruity finish with just enough hops to make it pleasant. No where near worth this ridiculous price.
Onuma KÃ¶lsch;Onuma, Japan;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;Brauhaus Onuma;Glowing, hazy yellow with a very crisp, white head. Grassy, light wheat, yeast, and slight citrus in the nose. Bubbly, medium body.

Riverside Raincross Wheat;Riverside, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Riverside Brewing Company (CA);It had a yeast aroma and a taste that was similar to warm fresh sourdough bread, but not as good.

Avalon Boxcar Wheat;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Avalon Brewing;On tap at the Avalon Brewpub. A good effort at a hefeweizen and better than average for a Mark James Group beer. Also above average for a brewpub British Columbian wheat beer.
Avalon Boxcar Wheat;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Avalon Brewing;This is the standout beer from Avalon for sure. Deep, cloudy, yellow colour. Banana aroma and mellow banana flavour to match. Lightly sprtizy, yet fuller-bodied for a hefe.

Avalon Boxcar Wheat;North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Avalon Brewing;"Cloudy beige; crisp, wheaty, citric aroma (though they did serve it with lemon before I could stop them). Toned down banana compared to other Mark James hefes. Drier all round as well, with a decent bit of hop in the finish, and lacking the malty sweetness that Yaletown''s hefe in particular has. Not a bad wheat, but a little different from what I expected at a Mark James brewpub."

Floral aroma - sugary sap to be precise - with an underlying maltyness. Dark Amber. Off-white head; initially very impressive but soon shrinks away. Ever so slightly bitter, with a sweet and sour finish. Thereâ€™s a maltyness in there and some fruit. I rarely eat fruit so am struggling to place it. Something thatâ€™s been tinned in syrup no doubt. However itâ€™s not overdone, more sweetness would have been offputting for me. Light bodied. Thereâ€™s a lot of carbonation - itâ€™s really at the forefront. A slick mouthfeel in to the relatively abrupt finish. Would down a few of these and then hope no-one notices my burping and farting."

Rogues Roost Imperial Stout;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Rogues Roost Brewpub & Eatery;Draught. Malt has a heavy smell of toasted and molasses, moderate perfumey hop note, light earth for the yeast, with licorice, cola raisin and alcohol in the background. Head is small, light brown, creamy, has good lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is black. Flavor starts lightly sweet and acidic, then finishes moderately acidic and lightly bitter. Palate is medium to full, syrupy and has a soft carbonation. A unique Imperial Stout with some remarkable tastes.

Rogues Roost Imperial Stout;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Rogues Roost Brewpub & Eatery;Tap at the brewpub. Pitch black beer with a thin white head.

Rogues Roost Imperial Stout;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Rogues Roost Brewpub & Eatery;black with small tan head, nice lace. Nice aroma with chocolate, burnt toast, and molasses and bitter hops. Flavor not bad, goes down very smoothly, but body is not what was expected.
Rogues Roost Imperial Stout;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Rogues Roost Brewpub & Eatery;Draft, 2005. Black body, with a small chocolate brown coloured head. Mild muted roast in the aroma is coffee beans and dark chocolate but lacks cohesion. Flavour has a big initial roasty acoidity in the introduction but this fades as the glass goes on. Bitter muted chocolate, mild roast acidity throughout. Dry chalky cocoa in the finish. Average to medium palate has an almost oily mouthfeel but it is too thin for the beer in my opinion. Pleasantly enjoyable, but lacks the depth of character for transcendance.
Rogues Roost Imperial Stout;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Rogues Roost Brewpub & Eatery;"Black colour; thin light brown head. Aroma of roasted barley, tempered by light molasses, plus raisins, and faint esters (red currant?). Slightly oily, slightly creamy body. Mellow fruity-toffee maltiness predominates with just a hint of roasty tang. A little bit of lemony, peachy hop comes in late."
Rogues Roost Imperial Stout;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Rogues Roost Brewpub & Eatery;2004: 7.8% abv. Black in colour with a thin diminishing frothy tan head. Milk chocolate and roasty aroma. Chocolate, roasted coffee flavour with a lingering licorice and alcohol finish. Full bodied but thin mouthfeel with a light alcohol burn.

Boulder Beer Killer Penguin Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Boulder Beer Company;"DATE TASTED: January 26, 2015... GLASSWARE: Duvel oversized snifter... OCCASION: still waiting for Superstorm Iola to hit... APPEARANCE: starts well with an imposing label; intimidating dark garnet body that sports a frothy off-white head that laces with a brazen two-finger strength; lacing is spectral and substantial... AROMA: BIG apple, pear and sour fruit; powerful cherries--a nice mix of a beefy malty base and a kriek... PALATE: full-bodied, warming and hearty--yet smoothly sippable; a balanced barleywine, though it lacks a dry finish...TASTE: cherries are front and center; soft brown ale elements play on the sugary fruits; oddly not as winy as a barley purports to be...OVERALL:as I recalled from years past, a beer worthy of a blizzard watch; the price is about right for its heft; within its genre, not a standout, with enough imperfections to seek out better-rated beers..."
Boulder Beer Killer Penguin Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Boulder Beer Company;A nice barelywine, smooth but not the most interesting. Pours a beautiful clear red with a tan head. Smells of bourbon, caramel and apple cinnamon. Taste is creamy, with a lot of maltiness, more caramel and cinnamon, and some green apple and booziness in the finish. Paired with Mac & Cheese Balls, a booziness and spiciness is brought out that lingers. Happy 998.

Boulder Beer Killer Penguin Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Boulder Beer Company;Had this beer on 4/2/2003. Aroma is a sweet malt scent like you would expect from a Scottish Ale. Color is a rich clear amber with very good carbonation and a nice head. Taste is malty and bitter. Starting with a full body that goes down with a mellow sharpness. Finish is a sweet rich malt flavor backed by quick bitterness. In the end it leaves you with a warm alcohol feel.

Boulder Beer Killer Penguin Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Boulder Beer Company;rating from memory, had this around 11/06, 22oz bomber, purchased at Chuckâ€™s wine and spirits outside of cleveland. pours dark amber, nose sorta old ale like, sweet caramel and fruits. taste was pretty enjoyable, sweet malts, fruits, chocolate, and subtle vegetable notes. pretty tasty and aged fine.
Boulder Beer Killer Penguin Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Boulder Beer Company;"11-Sep-06 (22 oz bottle: Obtained 30-Jul-04 in trade with Eyedrinkale, thanks Mike!) Lots of age under this one, so the characteristics arenâ€™t surprising; it tastes and smells malty, earthy (the aroma is almost pungently so), chocolaty and moderately sweet. Brown sugar and dark fruits, but itâ€™s moderately sweet, staying far away from anything remotely cloying. Bitterness, either from roastiness or hops is very mild if it ever existed in the first place. Whatever spice might have been in this winter-warmer-gone-wild is tough to pick out at this stage over the earthiness and dark fruits. Really coming across as an aged old ale to me. As mentioned, the aroma is earthy, but unmistakable sweet fruits come out even more. Body is medium-full and medium carbonation has held up perfectly after two-plus years in the bottle. Light brown in color, the beer is cloudy out of the bottle, but it pretty much clears up completely over time. Small, light-tan head shows more life on the second (and thus warmer) pour, but either way, it settles to a filmy layer after not too long. Only a few wisps of lace stick to the glass. Very enjoyable to drink, but this has almost certainly transformed into quite a different beer from when it was fresh. And with the aging, it has followed a pretty standard transition toward earth and dark fruits, but the chocolate overtones give it a nice note of distinction."
Founders Sparkling Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"On tap at Founders. According to the sign on the wall, this is 8% ABV, and more reminiscent of a Tripel than a Blond Ale. Poured yellow-orange colored, with a creamy medium off-white head. Banana and perhaps a touch of clove in the aroma, which developed vinous characteristics as the beer warmed. Flavor was very fruity, like a cross between bananas and white wine. Lemon characteristics were nicely developed as well. In fact, this beer had a candy-like flavor that reminded me of the candy coating on lemon ""Crybaby"" sour gumballs. Alcohol shows up in the aftertaste but is nicely subdued in the body. Spritzy and tasty, this is probably a different recipe than last year's batch."
Founders Sparkling Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Alcohol well hidden. Quite fruity but bland and quite plain. Not sure exactly what this style entails.
Diamond Knot ESB;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Diamond Knot Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a clear light amber color, thin white cap of a head. Sly lace. The aroma had some light grassy hop elements. Light lingering toast/biscuits. Sweet butter (not diacetyl). The flavor leaned towards the malty side but with that British bitter edge to it. Sly biscuit malt aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation. ABV felt fine. Overall, decent to me, and seemingly decent as an ESB.
Diamond Knot ESB;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Diamond Knot Brewery;Draught in a flight at the MLT brewpub. Pours a clear light amber color. Nose has some light grassy elements to it, and seems a bit bitter. Taste is only slightly bitter, but has some hints of malty sweetness to it. OK.
Diamond Knot ESB;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Diamond Knot Brewery;Draft at Mountlake Terrace brewpub. Darker sweet orange-brown, soapy head. Malty caramel. Medium syrup body, dry bitter. bready yeast. Solid, if a little boring, ESB.

Diamond Knot ESB;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Diamond Knot Brewery;Nice english style bitter that had a good malt balance and nice mouthfeel although it may have been a little carbonated and not totally my thing.
Diamond Knot ESB;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Diamond Knot Brewery;"Clear caramel color/ lasting white head; nice lacing. Toasted, spicy caramel aromas with a whiff of pit fruit. Smooth medium body. Spicy sweet toasted caramel, marshmallow, grainy malt flavors--good."
Diamond Knot ESB;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Diamond Knot Brewery;My Bottom Line: Toasted malts and their caramelized counterparts are bothered by dusty minerals before bitter hop resins conclude an otherwise drinkable Extra Special Bitter. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the hazy dark amber, lacing well. -That dusty impression, present in all of their brews that day, was akin to hard tap water. -The flavor profile was a tad too generic to be memorable. -This remains balanced throughout. On tap at the Front St. brewpub
Diamond Knot ESB;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Diamond Knot Brewery;Tap at the brewpub. Pours ruddy amber with a creamy beige head.

Diamond Knot ESB;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Diamond Knot Brewery;2010-07-01. Crisp golden amber body with a small off-white head and lace. 3+ Flavour is mild, pleasant light bitterness throughout, hints at citrus in the finish but a vegetal hop character spoils the effect. Aroma is mild, grainy malt, brief caramel and mild hops. Average palate, on the light side. Meh. On tap at Diamond Knot, Mukilteo

Duneland Salmon Tail Pale;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Duneland Brewhouse;Maybe the best beer they have...but donâ€™t get excited by that! Very mild hop bitterness, and I do mean mild...Weird detergent aftertaste...maybe they just cleaned their tap lines....but thatâ€™s OK, because it had SOME flavor...
Duneland Salmon Tail Pale;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Duneland Brewhouse;This doesnâ€™t really seem like an APA to me. All I really tasted was a soap-like quality and lots of malt. Little carbonation.
Duneland Salmon Tail Pale;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Duneland Brewhouse;Light orangy amber hue with faded fizzy head and no lace or body. The aroma hints of floral hops and citrus, caramel malts, but also displays a soapy and vegetable nose. The taste has a buttery biscuit, grainy and twangy hops taste, but again an off-taste of veggies and dirty lines ruin the palate. Mouthfeel is watery and bland, fizzy, no depth. Avoid this an ALL Duneland beers until under new ownership or till the day it closes.
Duneland Salmon Tail Pale;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Duneland Brewhouse;Light copper color. Tastes like rubber and yeast. Sparkling mouthfeel. Phenol. Some type of inner-tube taste. Some cereal tastes. Needs more hop and malt flavors to make this have more character.
Duneland Salmon Tail Pale;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Duneland Brewhouse;RateBeer Summer 2003: Clear light orange color, stale hops aroma with a bit of malts. Flat mouthfeel. Unimpressive.
Duneland Salmon Tail Pale;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Duneland Brewhouse;RBSG2003 Crystal clear amber brew. Small, creamy white head. The aroma is Malt Heaven! Caramel Popcorn! Butterscotch, toffee... everything malt! Original Ovaltine. Vanilla. Smells great! The flavor is rich and malty! Abundance of tart hop flavor to balance things out. Slightly vineous as well. Medium-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and pillow-soft carbonation. Lengthy, dry, astringent finish.
Duneland Salmon Tail Pale;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Duneland Brewhouse;Slightly sweet, some malt and a bit of hops. This doesnâ€™t automatically good beer. Average.
Duneland Salmon Tail Pale;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Duneland Brewhouse;OHHHH!!!! The slightest hint of hops lets them call this a Pae Ale. Obviously the brewer has never had a pale ale... They aren't supposed to smell like bubblegum and soap, They aren't supposed to be flat and lifeless, and they are supposed to have somewhat of a balance between malt and hops. This place has been close to my house for years and I've never heard of it...now I know why. RE-RATE: Much closer to a pale ale in the bottle, just don't get one from the tap!!
Duneland Winter Warmer;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - English;Duneland Brewhouse;Hugely syrupy, like an intense version of their amber, but a deeper, darker color and some interesting roasty and hoppy bitters.
Duneland Bubba Brown;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Duneland Brewhouse;Sad.........................................................................
Duneland Bubba Brown;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Duneland Brewhouse;Really dark brown. Once again a rubber, phenol, new shoes smell. Bland, not offensive, but really, really bland.
Duneland Bubba Brown;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Duneland Brewhouse;I don't know what to say except I truly sorry for anyone who has had this crap. Embarrassed by the fact this is brewed (if that is the right word) in my home county. Flat lifeless brown water with a hint of roasted malt thrown in. No body or taste. At least the wheat was not offensive.
Duneland Bubba Brown;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Duneland Brewhouse;Void of life, this brown water ale had a nose of bubblegum and wet cardboard. Almost completely absent of flavor, with just a pinch of sweet malts. Very poor quality. Hardly a brown ale.
Duneland Bubba Brown;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Duneland Brewhouse;A poor excuse for a brown. This is a brewpub for people who don''t like beer.
Duneland Bubba Brown;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Duneland Brewhouse;The amber is really dark and the brown is really light, so they come out with the same color, basically. It has body, malt, and hops, but all weak and somewhat at war with each other.
Duneland Shoreline Stout;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Duneland Brewhouse;Another disappointment from this place. They seem to be completely clueless about what theyâ€™re trying to create. I also was served this at just above freezing.
Duneland Shoreline Stout;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Duneland Brewhouse;Clear black stout with an off-white big bubbled head. Licorice aroma transforming into ashtray as beer warms up. Coffee and ashes in mouth, with lots of bitterness in finale. Decent body. Flawed. (July 31 at Indiana Microbrewers Festival)
Duneland Shoreline Stout;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Duneland Brewhouse;Regular roasted coffee smell and taste. Milky and creamy, light hop presence, but too thin. Basic sweet stout. Presentation points take a hit when they served this STOUT to me in a PILSENER glass, frosted, with ice floaties in it. I didn't even realize there were floaties until my first drink, when I felt something solid hit my lips and tongue, and my immediate reaction was to spit it back into the glass, as if I'd just sucked in a bug. Pissed me off. To be honest, the stout was not bad, it was just average. Mike and Joe later told me about the brown ale, and so now I'm curiously wanting to try it in a Cave Creek Chili Beer way.
Duneland Shoreline Stout;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Duneland Brewhouse;Served in an overly chilled glass. Perhaps their most flavorful beer. Dark, with a chocolate head. Creamy, smooth nose like chococolate candy, which carries through into the flavor. Some hops and a melted candy bar. Tasted more like an ImpStout than a sweet stout.
Duneland Shoreline Stout;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Duneland Brewhouse;Dark brown with reddish tones around the adges. Okay tan head and good lacing. Faint coffee/chocolate aroma. Hints of roasted grains, smoke and prune. Thin bodied for a stout, good bitter and sweet balance, bitter aftertaste. Dry and creamy mouthfeel. While drinkable compared to their other offerings, still way below average for the style.
Duneland Shoreline Stout;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Duneland Brewhouse;I echo Hennes rating. I purchased a growler for the Summer gathering, so everyone can taste this one. Very light all around stout, identical to the one you would brew with a Mr Beer Kit.
Duneland Shoreline Stout;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Duneland Brewhouse;Really the only Duneland brew worth drinking. It has a subtle smoked fish tone to its roast, some solid oaty notes, and a creamy mouthfeel. I might be overating it out of relief that I found a real beer in the joint, but I did appreciate coming to this one at the end of the session.
Duneland Wheat;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale;Duneland Brewhouse;Very weak attempt at an American Wheat...flat, tasteless, boring, and completely out of character for the style.
Duneland Wheat;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale;Duneland Brewhouse;There was a lemon stuck in there. Semi-clear look. Strong Pledge type of nose -- fake lemon. Muted hops and absolutely no wheat flavors. Some yeast flavors, but overall a poor representation.
Duneland Wheat;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale;Duneland Brewhouse;It was listed as a unfiltered hefe, what I got sure looked like a darker Krystall, almost no head either.Faint aroma with hints of grain, lemongrass, banana and some spices. What flavor? Just a light hint of malt and spices. VERY BLAND! A very bad wheat, lacks any characteristics of a hefe. Boring. Water would have been as good. Stuff like this is why many hate American Wheats. Avoid like the plague!
Duneland Wheat;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale;Duneland Brewhouse;Nothing in this beer, but an old dried out lemon wedge. Absolutely flat, not a hint of cloudiness, barely an aroma, barely a flavor to be identified. Light golden colored water with an old piece of lemon on the rim. Piss poor quality.
Duneland Wheat;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Wheat Ale;Duneland Brewhouse;Well, it does have a bit of a body, but it''s absolutely amazing how little flavor it has. I mean, you have to really work to get so unobtrusive a brew.
Brewmasters South Cherry Ice;Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Brewmasters Pub, Restaurant & Brewery;Add a marichino cherry to the IceMaster and you have this brew. Not much more than a kiddie cocktail.
Brewmasters South Icemaster;Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brewmasters Pub, Restaurant & Brewery;Pale straw color with a smaller white head. Neutral aroma. Light grain sweetness with little esle to report.
Brewmasters South Icemaster;Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brewmasters Pub, Restaurant & Brewery;Very, very light. Beyond yellow and into a tinged water. Clean. Some hops, but corn offers an odd taste. Smooth, refreshing type beer.
Brewmasters South Kenosha Gold Brewmasters Pilsner;Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brewmasters Pub, Restaurant & Brewery;Festival tap: Clear yellow with tiny head. Lager yeast and graininess. Light all around. some faint grassiness at finish.
Brewmasters South Kenosha Gold Brewmasters Pilsner;Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brewmasters Pub, Restaurant & Brewery;Protein hazed golden color with a small white cover of bubbles. Light malt and lager yeast aromas. Light pale malt, sweet start that leads to scads of floral hops and mild acidic bitterness. Actually served way too cold, but flavors still come out. Very malty finish.
Brewmasters South Kenosha Gold Brewmasters Pilsner;Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brewmasters Pub, Restaurant & Brewery;Slightly hazy look. Bit better than the average pilsner. Very smooth almost like there's nothing there. However, that is a detriment to the overall appeal with no real flavors or tastes coming through. Some hops or malt would have been nice.
Brewmasters South Kenosha Gold Brewmasters Pilsner;Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brewmasters Pub, Restaurant & Brewery;The commercial description is adequate with these caveats: To me this brew lacks the hoppy bitter bite of a good true Pilsner and as a lager leans too much toward the standard American style of insipid body, head, and flavor. I would prefer it over most of the American standards, with the understanding that none of them are my preference. Its finish is mildly sweet. The bottles of Kenosha Gold that I acquired were brewed by Gray Brewing Co. of Janesville under authority of Brewmasters' Pub, Ltd. of Kenosha, WI
Brewmasters South Oatmeal Stout;Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Brewmasters Pub, Restaurant & Brewery;Named after Saint Brendan. Dark brown color with a smaller taupe head. Light roasted malt flavors. Fairly light and body so the oatmeal almost seems wasted. Seems more like a brown porter.
Brewmasters South Oatmeal Stout;Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Brewmasters Pub, Restaurant & Brewery;Dark. Smoke, bacon flavors. No oatmeal. Tastes really similar to a ham and cheese sandwich, lightly grilled with a drop of butter.
Bricktown Laughing Ass;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;HAHAHAHA I laughed my ass off at how little taste this crap has. This is one of their more popular offerings, probabally because it is one of the more boring ones, how do you expect to SELL people on drinking beer if this is the sort of crap you come up with.
Bricktown Laughing Ass;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;This beer tastes only slightly better than Coors or Budweiser. Iâ€™d take a Miller Lite over this beer any day... High carbonation, even for a lager, and weak taste. I can see why this is their most popular beer - itâ€™s the best beer they have. Even so, you can see the other ratings. Itâ€™s just plain bleh.
Bricktown Laughing Ass;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Grainy stale aroma, sticky sweet crackers/wet toast, finish odd, long, and...papery. Cereal aftertaste.
Bricktown Laughing Ass;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Iâ€™d say this tasted really clean. I guess that means that there wasnâ€™t any noticable good or bad tastes. Just a slightly bitter ale. Some breadcrumb flavors. Decent.
Bricktown Laughing Ass;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Draught at the brewpub. Clear golden color with thin white head. Flowery hop aroma balanced well with the malt. This is one of their better offerings.
Bricktown Laughing Ass;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;On tap at the brewpub. Light yellow with fizzy big bubbles to its white head. Slight malty, hay-like aroma, but very slight. Watery harsh palate. Slight metallic finish. Sodium bicarbonate is the dominant flavor! No hops.
Bricktown Laughing Ass;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;One of the best this place has to offer. But that isnâ€™t saying much. Dark amber with a trace of a white head. Aroma of hay, bananas and some cocoa. A very weird combo for a pale ale. The taste is surpisingly sweet with dark bread and a toasted finish.
Bricktown Laughing Ass;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;"Sample at the brewpub. Medium clear amber, full-looking for a light; ok fresh grassy nose; light flavor, a hint of grainy hops, some biscuit in the background, not bad."
Bricktown Rudolphs Red Nose Ale;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Strong Ale - English;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;I was not terribly impressed with Bricktown in Dubuque. I am not totally surprised they went out of business. This was not well balanced. Serving: Tap
Bricktown Rudolphs Red Nose Ale;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Strong Ale - English;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Pretty dark, too sweet, fairly detestable. But if youâ€™re there in the winter, and you gotta get a beer... this one is probabally what you ought to go with.
Bricktown Rudolphs Red Nose Ale;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Strong Ale - English;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Pint at the brewery. Winter 2006 version. Red and brown colored body. Clear/filtered appearance. Has a light spiced nose with notes of peppermint, nutmeg and candy sugar. Flavor is similar - lght on the palate, nothing too complex or interesting, with a tasty mild spiced cherry, wood and candy sugar flavor. Reminds me of a very tame version of Troegs Mad Elf. I could probably have written a review of this beer just from sticking my head in the brewpub - nothing too fancy, nothing too â€™flavorfulâ€™ - brewed to not offend the Iowan palate.
Bricktown Rudolphs Red Nose Ale;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Strong Ale - English;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Draught at the brewpub. Clear light orange color without much head. Smells distinctly of brown sugar. Brown sugar comes out again in the flavor along with some cinnamon and possibly nutmeg. Flavor is also somewhat reminiscent of malt extract.
Bricktown Rudolphs Red Nose Ale;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Strong Ale - English;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Aroma of light mint and some malts. The taste is toast with some burnt sugar. Maybe a hint of mint. This poured a darker gold color. Not sure what was the goal with this beer.
Bricktown Vanilla Lager;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Other;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;"This was quite bad. Tasted like light beer plus artificial vanilla flavoring.

Bricktown Vanilla Lager;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Other;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;"Watery, crappy, tastes like chemicals and bud light. I know itâ€™s a chick beer and everything, but the artfical flavoring added after fermentation dosenâ€™t even make it all that sweet or tasty. Furthermore, shouldnâ€™t we have a little more respect for the ""chick"" beer drinkers, I know they can handle a little more flavor than this. WITH VANILLA ADDED!"
Bricktown Vanilla Lager;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Other;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Thereâ€™s a fake vanilla flavor to this terrible beer. Only one sip was all I needed to know I wasnâ€™t going to be drinking any more of that beer. I think I could get better results adding imitation vanilla to a budweiser.
Bricktown Vanilla Lager;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Other;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Well, at least this wasnâ€™t a vanilla porter. Too tired of vanilla porters. With that said, there needs to be some type of end to vanilla beers. There is a nice authentic bean flavor to this. Overall, the flavors are very faint, but at least theyâ€™re not too fake. Sort of tasted like a vanilla shake sort of bitter.
Bricktown Vanilla Lager;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Other;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Draught at the brewpub. Clear golden color with fleeting white head. Cloying vanilla flavor and aroma. Slightly sweet. No trace of hop as far as I could tell. Odd at best.
Bricktown Vanilla Lager;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Other;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Light gold body with a trace of head. Overwhelming vanilla aroma. The taste is like a light lager with the vanilla only in the finish. Underwhelming and one dimensional.
Bricktown Vanilla Lager;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Other;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Dark brown appearance and a dark brown effervesence makes this a bland beer. Weak malts, vanilla doesnâ€™t penetrate like it should. Not a great effort, a little too blatantly sweet as well.
Bricktown Vanilla Lager;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Other;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Brown in color. Weak malt content prevents vanilla flavoring from tasting synthetic. Poor head retention. Little or no hop content. If you like flat dark water with a slight chemical taste, this oneâ€™s for you. UPDATE: The brewer now calls this Gorilla Vanilla. It still sucks. Itâ€™s now yellow and fizzy with overcarbonation. Smells like a cream soda. Sodium burn on the tongue hurts the palate. No hops. A little metallic.
Brewery Creek Dortmunder;Mineral Point, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brewery Creek Brewing (WI);Just read my notes from our vacation and realilized that I didn't rate this one.

(Heineken);Aroma is decent with floral attributes, apperance is a deep, hazy copper body with average carbonation and a small white cap.

Kuchlbauer Aloysius;Abensberg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei zum Kuchlbauer;Bottle, old review, trip to Bavaria ages ago. I gave this a good score back then, warming sweet wheaty malt and a correct balance to keep drinkability.
Kuchlbauer Aloysius;Abensberg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei zum Kuchlbauer;Dunkler Weizenbock mit 7,2 % Alkohol und 16,5 % StammwÃ¼rze. Angelehnt an die Geschichte vom bayerischen Engel Aloysios, durchaus ein Bier bei dem man Frohlocken und Hosianna singen kann. Viel Hefe, viel schÃ¶n cremiger, fester Schaum. In Nuancen erinnert es an die Turm WeiÃŸe von Kuchlbauer, allerdings im Vergleich weit weniger fruchtig und sehr deutlich malziger. Recht sÃ¼ÃŸ, aber wohlschmeckend, da auch deutliche sÃ¤uerliche und bittere Noten vorhanden sind. Der hohe Alkoholgehalt ist immer zu schmecken, ist aber nie unangenehm. Sehr gut. Zusammen mit der Turmweisse, die Referenzbiere von Kuchelbauer. ErwÃ¤hnentswert: Viel, wirklich extrem feinperlige KohlensÃ¤ure. Trotzdem nicht zu scharf. Allerdings sehr viel Volumen und man ist sehr schnell pappsatt. Die KohlensÃ¤ure ist so feinperlig, dass sie sich zu keinem Zeitpunkt (auch nicht im Magen) vom Bier trennt. Kein mir bekanntes Bier ist dermaÃŸen sÃ¤ttigend. Das ideale Bockbier zur Fastenzeit. Mit dem Aloysius im Glas kann man mal ne Mahlzeit auslassen. Wer allerdings vorhat sich mal so richtig schÃ¶n anzusaufen, den stellt dieses Bier vor eine nahezu unlÃ¶sbare Aufgabe.
Kuchlbauer Aloysius;Abensberg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei zum Kuchlbauer;500ml bottle from RusBeerShop in Moscow. Pours hazy dark brown with a tall beige head. Aroma is caramel, bananas, a little earthy. Taste is medium sweet, bananas, wheat, toasted malt.

Pours dark brown with an off white head. The aroma has wheat and a little caramel, soft carbonation, a little chewy soft overipe banana, a nice warm boozy hit. Very nice.
Kuchlbauer Aloysius;Abensberg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei zum Kuchlbauer;Hier hat man wirklich ein tolles Produkt vor sich. Nicht nur, dass das Bier mit einer weiten Palette mit Aromen von hefig Ã¼ber frÃ¼chtig bis sÃ¤uerlich-malzig kommt, sondern, dass diese wunderbar miteinander verknÃ¼pft sind und ein weicher Ãœbergang zwischen den fruchtigen und herben Phasen Ã¼berzeugt. Ein wirklich schÃ¶nes, ausgewogenes Bier.
Kuchlbauer Aloysius;Abensberg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei zum Kuchlbauer;Bottle from kappldav. Many thanks! Brown colour, creamy beige foam. Lots of banana, some citrus. Light sweet, bit bready. Well balanced, nice!

Kuchlbauer Aloysius;Abensberg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei zum Kuchlbauer;In ordentlich, satt dunkelbrauner, trÃ¼ber Farbe zeigt sich das Bier im WeiÃŸbierglas, falls man die betonierte Hefe gut aus der Flasche herausgeschÃ¼ttelt hat. Die grobporige Schaumkrone baut sich dann doch recht bald ab. Der Antrunk ist recht alkoholisch, wÃ¼rzig, malzig-sÃ¼sslich und hefig. Der Mittelteil ist ausgeprÃ¤gt wÃ¼rzig mit angenehmen dunkel malzigen Aromen. Der Abgang dann leicht hopfig herb werdend, mit malzigen und hefigen Charakter. Bei diesem WeiÃŸbierbock kommt alles zusammen, SÃ¼ÃŸe, SÃ¼ffigkeit, Geschmack, dunkle Aromen, Alkoholgehalt etc. Toll! Einzigstes Manko: Die Schaumkrone. Sie ist zwar schnell weg, das Bier ist aber glÃ¼cklicherweise noch eine ganze Weile erfrischend. Empfehlenswert!

Falcon JulÃ¶l (Julbrygd);Falkenberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Carlsberg Sverige;"04-02-2019; bottle; at home (bought somewhere in Sweden). The beer has a nice ruby red colour, with an amber touch. It has a lovely bright glow. The beer is crystal clear. On top, some greyish foam is formed. Foam retention is a bit low. The bulk collapses quickly, to leave only a thin drape. The aroma of the beer is alright. It is not too special to be honest, but it is nice. There are some nice aromas of malts, that give some caramel and raisin. There is some bubblegum here to somehow. Hops are herbal, but not to aromatic. There is also a fruity note, some berry I think. The taste of the beer is fine. The beer is quite sweet, but has a lovely strong hop bitterness to balance it. The result is a very well balanced beer. Nice. The palate of the beer is fine. The body is medium and the texture a tiny bit rough. Carbonation is average. The finish of the beer has some spicy hop notes, a touch of alcohol and some nice malty notes. In the end, a nice lingering dry bitterness is present. Not a bad beer at all; it is a nice one. Just not mega special."

Butterfield Anniversary Ale;Fresno, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;Butterfield Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery: Opaque brown/orange color with a tan head. The aroma was sweet...malt...cascade hops...grapefruit...sugar. The flavor was very sweet with a noticable alcohol kick. The finish was pure cascade hops bitterness.

Sierra Blanca Roswell Alien Amber Ale;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Had this on tap in the city of Roswell .. had to do that. Poured an amber color with a thin sized head. Toasted caramel and grains ... on the sweeter side and plain.
Sierra Blanca Roswell Alien Amber Ale;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Sierra Blanca was an unknown brewer to me until dinner the other evening in Santa Fe. Today I try their amber ale in a 12 oz bottle. Chilled well and pouring into a shaker glass, it appears a dark amber in color sporting a thin, light tan head. The nose is caramel, cereal and a bit medicinal. And the taste, malt, some hops, grain and a small sweetness. Not bad. Just uninspiring. It might benefit with a slice of lime.
Sierra Blanca Roswell Alien Amber Ale;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle from wchesser. Thanks!

Sierra Blanca Roswell Alien Amber Ale;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Bottle @ Home. Darker amber colored beer with a small khaki head. Smells like chlorine, cardboard, and caramel. Maybe some toast? Flavor is just crappy caramel sauce, cardboard, and prune juice. Super sugary, sweet, and oxidized.

Back Road Maple City Gold;La Porte, Indiana, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Back Road Brewery;Pour from a 12oz bottle, six pack bough 6/17/23013 at King Richardâ€™s in Michigan City.

Back Road Maple City Gold;La Porte, Indiana, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Back Road Brewery;12oz bottle, no date. 7.2% for a mÃ¤rzen? Dang. Clear orange brown with a short-lived 1/2 finger beige head that faded to a ring. Nuts, toast, and caramel are the dominant aromas while some hard water mineral notes were in the background. Flavor adds a slightly overbaked sugar cookie and more bitterness than Iâ€™d have guessed from the aroma--peaked at a 3 in the dry earthy finish. Light carbonation with a medium body. Not too bad, but nowhere near my favorite for the style.
Back Road Maple City Gold;La Porte, Indiana, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Back Road Brewery;bottle - Pours dark amber. The aroma is mostly of caramel malts.

Back Road Maple City Gold;La Porte, Indiana, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Back Road Brewery;Ah, nothing beats a nice beer after a hard day of mountainbiking.

Adam Ravbar Kvasno Temno Pivo;DomÅ¾ale, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Adam Ravbar;Cloudy dark bronw beer topped by a thin off-white head. Pretty strange roasty nose reminds me of burnt buckwheat galettes which is not a particularly pleasant smell, but reminds of fond memories and hits the spot. Besides that, it stays focused on rather sweet, biscuit meets toffee sugary malts. Fortunately, the carbonation does the necessary cleansing job to reduce the sugary feel from that surprisingly frail body . Far from perfect, but still one of my favourite Slovenian dunkels from possibly my favourite brewer in the country.

Flatlanders Locomotive Stout;Lincolnshire, Illinois, United States;Stout;Flatlanders Restaurant & Brewery;Draught sample at the brewpub, December 28th 2006. Typical nitro pour, nice dark head lasts through my samples of 4 other beers, opaque jet body, bit of dark lacing....nose of chocolate and lots and lots of prunes, deep and fairly well structured though sweeter than I expected....watery body but no off flavors, lightly spicy with cinnamon and perhaps a dash of licorice, grapy, bittersweet chocolate and touches of coffee....prune juice comes in at midpalate and doesnâ€™t go away, dominates far too much....not bad, but too fruity and lacking in roast.
Flatlanders Locomotive Stout;Lincolnshire, Illinois, United States;Stout;Flatlanders Restaurant & Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Pitch black with a creamy off-white, nearly brown, head. Malty sweet roasted aromas. Caramel and burnt flavours. Mouthfeel is surprisingly sweet for an irish stout. I belive there has been used caramel and crystal malts in the beer. Finishes lightly roasted, but not bitter.
Flatlanders Locomotive Stout;Lincolnshire, Illinois, United States;Stout;Flatlanders Restaurant & Brewery;Not much going on on any level here. Virtually no nose. Watered down mouthfeel. Weak flavors of roasted malt/chocolate/coffee, but very weak. I wasted 10 minutes on this one!
Flatlanders Locomotive Stout;Lincolnshire, Illinois, United States;Stout;Flatlanders Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Goose Island Stoutfest. Poured a deep brown with only a light ring of toffee head. Nose was of semi-sweet roasted chocolate and a little caramel.. not much more. Flavor picked up the chocolate and some stale coffee.. also just OK. Carbonation was too low resulting in a flat feel to it. Body was light to light-med. This was drinkable, but powerfully mediocre.

Goose Island Old Aberration;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at GI Clybourn. Poured a deep red with a small tan head. Aroma is of malt, sweet hops, spice, and alcohol. Nice malty taste, with a delicious super hoppy backbone. Notes of spice and raisins. Deep warming alcohol presence. Creamy mouthfeel that goes down smooth, without being too intense. Insanely drinkable.

Goose Island Lake Effect Winter Ale (2002-2013);Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Flight on tap at the Clybourn Brewpub (Chicago, IL). Pours a deeper hazed golden amber hue. Good glow, mellow carbonation. Offwhite cakey head sits atop and laces well, sticks around. Aromas are Citra hops, gentle bready and straw grainy malts. Doughy, touches of spice, mellow citrus, florals and that Citra feel gives some good life. Gentle straw, dryness hit from the yeast, some spice, mellow lemon, bready malts. Initial is lighter bodied, a touch of girth from the malt bill. Firm hoppy presence up front offers florals, grass, lemon, gentle Citra fruity tropical presence. Bready and crisp straw, grainy malts. Some gentle spiciness, Belgian yeast influence starts to float into the middle. Firmer dry middle and hoppy backend, never gets a bit heavy or sweet. The malt body is there and never really changes. The hops glide over it, firmly dry, citrusy, a nice nose and more earthy floral backend and finish. Gentle bready, straw, and grainy malt body as we move through. Gentle spice, yeast, touch of lotion and lemon as we move into backend and finish become more assertive. Firm inviting dry hoppy element finishes, gentle yeasty, gentle fruity elements meld with the hops. Really plays well together. Nice Citra dose on the nose, firmly hopped beer but nothing Iâ€™d call strong. Pretty nice Belgian Ale with a nice American hop spin.

Pours very similar to broad shoulders with a deep clear copper pour and topped with a thin to medium soapy barely off-white head... Mild citrus and light yeasty nose where the latter takes precedence. Subdued, earthy almost saison like yeasty nose... Flavors Carry forward with the same yeasty profile upfront, some banana and citrus coinciding with one another while finishing with a tame yet somewhat assertive bitterness that lingers to some degree. Smooth medium bodies with adequate carbonation. Finish was a little too bitter for me but still not that bad.

Pours an amber crimson body with an off white head. Hoppy as hell. Awesome hop accents of pine, grapefruit rinds light citrus, a bit of grass and some fresh cut herbs. Maybe a bit green even on the hop tones but nevertheless a flavorful explosion with a full body to back it up. This was great stuff.

Piece Prescription Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Swung by the brew put today, the pils was th only one left that I havenâ€™t had. Poured into a nice mug. Crystal clear with a fluffy white head that goes away. It always amazes me when I have a German Pils because of how different it is from a Bohemian or even a Dortmunder. Clear yellowy gold. Nose is bread and spice with some nice noble hop character. Distinct bitterness as I drink, obvious for the style, finish is pretty dry, not sure why others felt it sweet at all. Very clean and easy drinking lager. Nice!
Piece Prescription Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Not bad considoring its not the most exciting style out there. Its got some good malt backbone but it starts and finishes too sweet for me. A good way to get miller lite fans into the resturant, but if I am there and spending the money I will pick something else.
Piece Prescription Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;I canâ€™t believe they didnâ€™t have this on tap for almost 3 years.

Schlitz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Originally rated on 9/19/08. I sure am glad i dont have to drink this stuff anymore. Watery flavor and mouthfeel, faint aroma of old grain. There are plenty of other more deserving light beers out there.
Schlitz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"Looking at old high school photos from the 80â€™s and I came across several photos of parties. This jogged my memory so I shall do a retro review of a ""quarters"" beer from my past. Aroma- not much memory of this, I do remember that we made fun of this and the other cheap beers that we played quarters with (Hammâ€™s, Fischerâ€™s, Strohâ€™s, Falstaff and PBR Light) for smelling and tasting like the cans they came in. Appearance- this is a very pale yellow brew. Taste- the high school kidâ€™s dream, very little beer taste but has alcohol in it. Palate- Very watery with mild carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Overall- This was not a good beer, but it was invaluable in my development. I miss the fact that Schlitz is gone."
Schlitz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Can (Old Notes)-Pours golden with a white head. Aroma of corn, grains, and slight sweetness. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew I snot bad tasting.
Schlitz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Probably as good as any of the cheap, high volume light beers. Chill it to the point of freezing and it is ok.
Schlitz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;This is a typical light beer. Pale golden yellow body with white head that disappears. Smells like a macro lager. Taste isnâ€™t too bad. It has a hint of sweet to it. Its just as good (if not better) than most light lagers and its MUCH cheaper. This is a value beer (less than $10 a case) and it somewhat pays off. Serving type: can Reviewed on: 03-19-2007 18:22:40
Schlitz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Delicious from top to bottom of can. I even drank the spit that came with the final drop of Schlitz Light while I tipped the can over my face for 3 whole minutes. Donâ€™t waste a drop.
Schlitz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Thanks to my father in law for supplying this one. Sampled from a 12 oz can this beer poured a medium golden color with a large soapy white head. The aroma is sour, tangy and corny indusrial brew. The flavor was dry, tangy and a bit corny. Pretty darn good for a maco light beer.
Schlitz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Well, this stuff is better than Buttmonkey. Nice silver can and it is rather clean smelling with a little sweet corn in there. Has enough personality to be a regular pale lager instead of light. Does taste a little different than the regular schlitz. Only 33 cents per can, good lawnmower beer. Probably decent for a session too if money is an issue. Ubiquitous pale yellow american lager, not bad. Has manners and can be appreciated by a frugal spender.
Schlitz Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Can. Pours yellow with a white head. Aroma of corn, grain, and slight hops. Flavor is watered down completely, corn, metal, slight bitterness. Thin, cheap, it only looked like beer.

Sonoma Mountain Golden Pilsner;Glen Ellen, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sonoma Mountain Brewery;This was an excellent beer at one point in time. If you can find it somewhere stored in the back room, snatch it up.
Sonoma Mountain Golden Pilsner;Glen Ellen, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sonoma Mountain Brewery;"Bottle from batch #062. This brewery is now defunct, but I found a bottle at a local store the other day. A golden color with a laced white head. An impressive aroma with caramel and malts. The flavor is better than a typical pilsner. Too bad this place went under. ""The aroma of the Golden Pilsner is a refreshing blast of hop fragrances blended from Tettnanger, Saaz, Willamette, Liberty, Cascade and Mt. Hood."" Fuel my pils, please!"
Sonoma Mountain Amber Lager;Glen Ellen, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sonoma Mountain Brewery;Although the brewery is gone, I thought I would add this.

Sonoma Mountain Amber Lager;Glen Ellen, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sonoma Mountain Brewery;Bottle from batch 056. Although the brewery is now defunct, I still found a dusty six pack at a local liquor store. Imagine my surprise to find they were pretty good. A reddish brown color with a foamy tan head.

Nose: very malty with notes of caramel, hops and fruity touches of oranges. Taste: medium carbonation. Firm bitter with lots of malts, yeast, grains and hay. The fruity sweetness is very hard to notice. The aftertaste is rather dry and fresh thirst-quenching. I did not enjoy this beer a lot to be honest.
Antwerps Blond;Antwerpen, Belgium;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Huisbrouwerij 't Pakhuis;Tap @ brewery. Not a special blond. Nice sweet notes and smooth finish. Nothing special but okay!
Antwerps Blond;Antwerpen, Belgium;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Huisbrouwerij 't Pakhuis;"One of the Pakhuis house beers, tasted there years ago.

Antwerps Blond;Antwerpen, Belgium;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Huisbrouwerij 't Pakhuis;Draught @ â€™t Pakhuis. Bright orange with little white head. Nose is rotting oranges & spices, mouldy plaster, stagnant yeast & some malts. Taste is mouldy plaster, spices, old stale dusty yeast, paint, mushroom, malts, light white pepper. Stale old yeast body. Comparable to their Lente bier but even below. Another one I would say has very clear flaws. Gave it to a less picky friend to finish â€“ first time I saw his struggling with a beer. Hard to compliment.

The aftertaste is a little bitter with slightly soft notes of sweetness and a low dry feeling.
Antwerps Bruin;Antwerpen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Huisbrouwerij 't Pakhuis;Tap @ brewery. Nice brown pour. Dark fruits. Again, not that amazed. Okay brown/abbey double.

Clear mahogany clour under a thin off-white head; caramelly, candi syrup, walnuts, dried fruits, yeasty spicy notes, thin mouthfeel (even on the watery side) and, like the blonde, not enough hops to balance. Disappointing."
Antwerps Bruin;Antwerpen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Huisbrouwerij 't Pakhuis;Not the best brown but this one is better than their other offerings. Caramel and brown sugar with weak finish.

It has got a nice tastepallate as well , subtile and elegant . Aftertaste is dark , sweet ( sugar or malts ? Thin line here ) and actually very good . One of the better ones i tasted from them . Would love a full bodied, 10 % - ish version of this one though cause this is simply to watery for my taste .

Den Bangelijke;Antwerpen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Huisbrouwerij 't Pakhuis;Encore une triple classÃ©e en belgian strong .. et pourtant câ€™est mis sur la face avant de lâ€™Ã©tiquette, sous le nom, mais en plus petit, câ€™est vrai. Je vais demander au brasseur de mettre des caractÃ¨res de 2 cm de hautÂ !! Niveau abv de 8,3 %Â . Mon exemplaire Ã©tait Ã  9 mois aprÃ¨s sa date. Couleur dorÃ© soutenu, lÃ©gÃ¨rement ambrÃ©, avec de la levure en suspension. Bulles fines, partout, trÃ¨s vives. Mousse blanche, crÃ©meuse, stable Ã  3 mm. ArÃ´mes de malt, babeurre, geniÃ¨vre, pointe de girofle. 1Ã¨re bouche trÃ¨s souple Ã  la belle entame malt/levure/coriandre. ArriÃ¨re-bouche bien maltÃ©e, assez riche. 2Ã¨me Ã  la belle texture, mais Ã  lâ€™harmonie trÃ¨s alÃ©atoire. ArriÃ¨re-bouche Ã  la girofle prÃ©dominante. 3Ã¨me qui perd complÃ¨tement le style pour arriver Ã  un patchwork dÃ©cevant. ArriÃ¨re-bouche vague, trÃ¨s faible. Longueur qui ne peut redresser la barre. Jambes fines, serrÃ©es, collantes. Levure douce, un peu Ã©picÃ©e, ligne correcte. Alcool correct, mais il ne parvient pas Ã  tenir le bateau sur la longueur. Finale banale. CONCLUSIONÂ : triple oui, peut-Ãªtre, Ã  la belle texture, mais aux saveurs qui partent trÃ¨s vite en vrille, pour ne plus rien offrir au final. DÃ©cevant .. et pas du tout surprenant (bangelijk..).

Felinfoel Celtic Gold;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Felinfoel Brewery;Felinfoel obviously were not sure of this one as their nane only appears in small print on the bottle. Considering they produce the superb Double Dragon ale this in comparison is a bit poor. More like a lager than a pale ale it has no outstanding points. A rather bland golden coloured ale that has nothing to stand out from the crowd. No wonder the brewery only half owned it.
Felinfoel Celtic Gold;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Felinfoel Brewery;"Bottled. Straw with moderate head and condition. Not wishing to disparage the Welsh, but if someone asked me to taste this blind and guess its source I would say it was a third world country, maybe the Indian subcontinent. It has a sickly sweet and slightly fruity nose, hints of really cheap asian whiskey and aftershave and a nasty lingering finish. Is the correct pronunciation of the brewery ""feeling foul""?"
Adam Ravbar Kvasno MeÅ¡ Pivo;DomÅ¾ale, Slovenia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Pivovarna Adam Ravbar;A half and half mix of light and dark beer. Pours a dark copper color, topped with almost completely white head, small and non-lasting. Grassy and flowery aroma, some minimal roasty presence. Taste starts sweet, some caramel in there, as well as slightly herbal. A bit metallic in aftertaste. Not bad, but better stick to original ones.

Kelham Island Red Rudolph;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kelham Island Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) at the Pigs Ear Beer Festival, London on 6 December 2006. Noted at 5.0%. Ridiculously bright red colour - looks rather like Ribena. Must be some food colouring in use here surely? Very little aroma -certainly little fruit in evidence. Comes over as a softish, standard bitter. Gimmicky and not very interesting.
Kelham Island Red Rudolph;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kelham Island Brewery;Cask@Pigs Ear BF 06. This was dissapointing, given that i have had good experiences with this brewers beer. Not much in the aroma or the flavour. Mouthfeel is quite grainy and dry, but completely empty.
Kelham Island Red Rudolph;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kelham Island Brewery;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Pigs Ear BF. Clear red colour. some yeast on aroma. Itâ€™s a not very good bitter that is red. Flat, dull and boring.
Kelham Island Red Rudolph;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kelham Island Brewery;1. Cask Handpump at the Devonshire Cat, Sheffield 22/12/2001 Iâ€™ve noticed this beer sometimes appears without the red colouring as â€™Unred Rudolph Rides Againâ€™ Golden coloured slightly fruity cherry flavour. Powerful hop finish. 2. Cask Stillage at the Fat Cat, Sheffield 22/12/2002 Clear golden coloured and hoppy. Some dryness in the finish.
Kelham Island Red Rudolph;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kelham Island Brewery;"A surprise this one. Basically this is a re-release of the seasonal Red Rudolph beer (hence ""Rides Again""). Held up to the light this is the brightest red beer I have seen. Flavours consist of fruity, biscuit malts. A long dry finish completes this very good Xmas ale."

SKA Mexican Logger;Durango, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;SKA Brewing;"12 ounce can into lager glass, best before 8/11/2019. Pours slightly hazy pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big lemon, cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of lemon, cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and no astringent hop flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no fruity/yeasty notes present. Moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-plus carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.2%. Overall this is an excellent pale lager. All around great robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Great clean pils malt/grain showcase, with nice noble hop presence/balance for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example."
SKA Mexican Logger;Durango, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;SKA Brewing;Can pour. Nice basic lager, crisp clean with light toast and biscuit notes.
SKA Mexican Logger;Durango, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;SKA Brewing;Pours a clear straw yellow on tap with bubbly white head that dissipates to leave light lace. Aroma of light corn and bready grain, a slight earthy undertone, a musty skunked yeast on the back end. Taste follows, light and easy, definitely hits the marks for style, and is great garnished with a lime. Not bad for what it is, and could crush a few of these for sure.
SKA Mexican Logger;Durango, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;SKA Brewing;Aroma: Can - initially the aroma is yeast, bread and then it quickly fades and a faint amount of citrus remains. The malt aroma is light almost cracker. The Hop Aroma is very faint and communicates a light lemon citrus and there might be a touch of cilantro in the back of the nose as well. The only other or aromatic I'm getting its a little bit of a soapy smell. Appearance: the body is crystal clear and a golden pale yellow is the color. The head is white with a mixture of medium and small bubbles and it lingers on top of the beer but thins to about a centimeter. Flavor: Slightly toasted malts making the flavor impression more like a Saltine cracker. There's not a lot of hop flavor but there's a slight touch of a lemon rind citrus, but the Hops communicate a bitterness that lingers on the back of the tongue. Balance is toward the bitter side. The finish is bitter and a flavor that is distinctly a lager. Mouthfeel: the carbonation of this beer is high making the mouth feel and seem thin but really it's more of a medium consistency. There is no alcohol warmth that I can detect and there's no creaminess due to the high level of carbonation and there's definitely some astringency from the Carbonic bite associate with this level of carbonation. Overall: on a hot summer day after mowing a lawn this is a great Mexican laher to just sit back and relax and enjoy it's not too hoppy not to malty or too sweet has a nice balance of bitterness and it's refreshing.
SKA Mexican Logger;Durango, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;SKA Brewing;Sample at the Feast of Saint Arnold. Pours a clear, yellow color, with a fairly big, foamy, white head. The aroma is wet grass, corn, white bread, pine, and honeysuckle. Sweet, with a light bitterness. Light body, with a crisp mouthfeel. This is a simple and mellow lager, and surprisingly well made.
SKA Mexican Logger;Durango, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;SKA Brewing;This beer is terrible. The aroma is gross and cheap. The flavor is one dimensional and the aftertaste is disgusting. Fuck this shit
SKA Mexican Logger;Durango, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;SKA Brewing;Draft from Criollo in Flagstaff. Clean tasting, fairly crisp lager - nothing exciting but certainly very drinkable and enjoyable enough with food.
SKA Mexican Logger;Durango, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;SKA Brewing;Draft compliments of Zac while dodging a hail/rain storm at Purgatory. Really a nice lager that seemed to have hints of lime plus light bitterness. Enjoyable.
SKA Mexican Logger;Durango, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;SKA Brewing;Draft at Purgatory. Pale yellow with white head. Grainy with a wheaty, full finish for such a light beer. Not a Corona clone. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
SKA Mexican Logger;Durango, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;SKA Brewing;Pretty good. Easy drinking. Certainly not a favorite Mexican lager. Worth a try if you like trying different lagers.

Grapefruit, tangerine, flower, and pine hop flavors with just a light cracker malt character.
SLO IPA;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;IPA;SLO Brew;This is really a fantastic smelling beer, and anything less than a 8 is wrong. Tons of hops with floral notes mixed in. The flavor is good but not as hoppy as the aroma. The finish is surprisngly unbitter, too much so actually. A fantastic start that fades too much.
SLO IPA;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;IPA;SLO Brew;Draught at the brewpub. Lightly hazy nut brown, small head. Rich citric nose. Mid sweet with cleanm, rounded but unfirm mouthfeel. Heavily hopy, which covers the shortcomings in the malt depatrment well. Marked resiny bitterness.

SLO IPA;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;IPA;SLO Brew;"OK.

What a better way to finish off the day than to sit down with a sampler platter of ice cold uber-crappy beer."" On to the beer: Light hop bitterness. very low hop aroma. Maybe a bit of dishrag. Amber color. Lots of carbonation to replace the waning hops."

SLO IPA;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;IPA;SLO Brew;Draught at the Santa Barbara location. Clear ruddy amber color with a creamy head. Herbal, piney hops in the aroma. Basic Cali IPA flavor profile, with piney and grapefruit peel hop flavors with a light toasted malt base that gives a little grain sweetness. All the flavors seem pretty light and watered down though. Makes for a sessionable and balanced beer, though for the strength, this should pack some more in there. Finishes bitter, with a medium-light body and crisp carbonation. Alright for a lighter flavored IPA.
SLO IPA;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;IPA;SLO Brew;Sampled on draught: medium bodied brew, porus a clear amber colour with a big white head. lots of classic citrusy character in the taste. Hops are noticeable, not overly strong but pleasent and well integrated.

SLO Oatmeal Stout;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Stout;SLO Brew;Tap @ brewery. Opaque, with a black body underneath a creamy tan head. Chocolate, caramel and turtle fudge chocolates combine with fudge brownies, mild EKG accents and lactic dark chocolate to create a delectable nose. Sweet chocolatey entities form a flavor enhanced by semi sweet chocolate morsels and moderate baking bricks. Cocoa patties and a soggy fudgie pull. Caramel courses through the latent brownie batter to help reunite it with the turtle candy parallels. Medium-to-fuller bodied, with a flavor and substance akin to a room temp mocha macchiato. Definitely this breweryâ€™s best foot forward.
SLO Oatmeal Stout;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Stout;SLO Brew;this is one great oatmeal stout.one of my favorite brews for sure.i just wish they bottled it!

Huntington Beach Blonde;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Huntington Beach Beer Company;Draft. Very light aroma and flavor. No off-flavors, so thatâ€™s a plus. Goes well with food, but not a primary drinking beer.
Huntington Beach Blonde;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Huntington Beach Beer Company;On-tap at the brewpub on 15th July 2014 during my Orange County coastal pub crawl. Not overly impressed, light golden in colour, no head, fizzy and bland. Straw, grass and corn all came to mind as I tried to drink this while sat at the bar looking at the kettles that brewed it. Cows like straw, grass and corn, I do not.
Huntington Beach Blonde;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Huntington Beach Beer Company;On tap at the brewery. It pours bright yellow with no foam. Streaming bubbles look nice in the glass. The aroma is grainy with some popcorn. The flavor is grainy and watery with some very light hints of spicy noble hops.

Huntington Beach Blonde;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Huntington Beach Beer Company;I had this on tap at Huntington Beach Beer Company. It pours golden with no head, very little carbonation. The taste is moderately sweet. There isnâ€™t a whole lot going on here

M: Light in body with very low carbonation. O: Donâ€™t bother. Donâ€™t waste your money.
Huntington Beach Blonde;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Huntington Beach Beer Company;Draught sample at the restaurant.

Kuchlbauer Alte Liebe - Dunkle Weisse;Abensberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei zum Kuchlbauer;Review from old notes of a trip to Bavaria. It seems I liked this one, nicely balanced dunkelweizen with a malty but not cloying note.
Kuchlbauer Alte Liebe - Dunkle Weisse;Abensberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei zum Kuchlbauer;On tap at Kuchlbauer Brewery after a short cycle ride from CampingplÃ¤tz FelbermÃ¼hle, weather has been shocking but brewery architecture and beer is great. Pours conker brown but cloudy, taste is wheat, a little nutty and with a hint of chocolate lovely soft mouthfeel, very nice beer.
Kuchlbauer Alte Liebe - Dunkle Weisse;Abensberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei zum Kuchlbauer;Bottle from bier-kaufen.de. Hazy murky brown colour, beige foam. Nose of banana, light roasted malts. Taste is malty, light sweet, quiet watery.
Kuchlbauer Alte Liebe - Dunkle Weisse;Abensberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei zum Kuchlbauer;Bottle at home thanks to SinH4!! A bit hazy dark brown with fluffy dark beige head. Sweet plums, caramel, fresh bread, banana, light green leaves, cream, stroopsoldaatjes, sweet brown beer sugar syrup, fried banana in dough, pancakes. All the above sounds very sweet, but the beer itself is actually just about medium sweet, it just has sugary aromas. Under medium bitter too. Medium bodied with doughy feel. Quite enjoyable.
Kuchlbauer Alte Liebe - Dunkle Weisse;Abensberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei zum Kuchlbauer;Die Alte Liebe ist eigentlich ein tolles dunkles Weizenbier. Es verfÃ¼gt Ã¼ber alle feinen Geschmacknuancen, die ich mir erwarte und diese harmonieren auch passabel miteinander, aber wenn ich es im Vergeleich mit der Turmweisse sehe, dann finde ich, dass da mehr drinnen wÃ¤re: mehr Frucht, mehr Hefe, mehr Kraft...es ist wohl gut erfrischend und als Erfrischungsbier sicher zu empfehlen, aber bayrische WeiÃŸbiere schaffen eine bessere KomplexitÃ¤t.

Kuchlbauer gilt ja als WeiÃŸbierspezialist - allerdings erst bei diesen beiden Bieren zeigen sie tatsÃ¤chlich was sie wirklich kÃ¶nnen.

Florival Triple;Opwijk, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);"The tripel in this commissioned abbey beer series, since 1994 and originally the same beer as Affligem Tripel; I think it deserves investigation to find out if this is still the case today or not. Anyway, revisited today for the sake of finding this out, but I stupidly forgot to put an Affligem Tripel next to it so I still canâ€™t be sure. Pours a clear â€™old goldâ€™ colour with low fizz under a lacing, snow white, medium thick, moussy head. Aroma does not invite me to have a sip: tons of iron probably hailing from foam stabilizing agents, caramel syrup, cooked corn, cookie dough, sweaty grains, cooked cauliflower, melting plastic, badly hidden, wodka-like alcohol and honeyish cane sugar - this is so low in â€™esterinessâ€™ that I take the liberty to doubt whether this is even top-fermented (a remark I made with Affligem Tripel already some months ago)! Sugary sweet onset, honeyish and even a bit sticky, pineapple and banana but in an artificial kind of way, medium carbo; metallic middle phase, low and thin in maltiness but something caramelly comes up, phenolic finish with lingering sugary sweetness and lingering iron, next to warming, old â€™jeneverâ€™-like alcohol and a touch of earthy and grassy hop bitterishness, though insufficient to counter the initial sweetness. An artificial, iron-laden and overly sweet concoction, clearly made the cheapest way, including malt adjuncts. Not acceptable as a tripel and to add insult to injury, I remain convinced this is an alias of Affligem Tripel, which has suffered as much from its restyling as this one has. I have a lot of sympathy for this style, but it has been hollowed out by either amateur failures or industrialized, chemical clones like this. Do not buy this, no matter how much youâ€™re into tripels. Used to be better a decade ago - when it was already an alias of Affligem Tripel - but apparently making it cheaper in production has gained Delhaize more profits. Conclusion: this is exactly the same as Affligem Tripel, with exactly the same history (which nobody else cares about, probably)..."
Herforder 50/50 Apfel;Hiddenhausen-Sundern, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Herforder Brauerei (Warsteiner);Geruch wie Apfelsaft aber ehr etwas kÃ¼nstlicher, so wie Haribo mit Apfelgeschmack. Zumindest im Antrunk und im Mittelteil schmeckt dieses Zeug auch nach Apfelsaft, im Abgang im Prinzip auch, allerdings hier eher nach Apfelschorle. Bier ist absolut nicht zuschmecken. Es ist ein leckeres alkoholisches ErfrischungsgetrÃ¤nk, aber mit Sicherheit hat es nichts mit Bier zu tun. Schwer zu bewerten.... Test vom 3.6.2006, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 7,7,7,7,12,7 - 7,25

Maxwells Dunkelweizen;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Maxwells Brewery and Pub;I must first say that if you go to Maxwell's try their home brewed Ginger Blackberry ale (non-alcoholic)--not only is it incredibly tasty, but it was the best of the selections I sampled. In any cae, the dunkelweizen is of a lovely, hazy orange color topped with a dollop of cream. The aroma is of a heavy musk aroma from which banana can eventually be identified. Well balanced with some banana flavor as well. Despite the name, this seems no more than a typical german wheat to me.
Maxwells Dunkelweizen;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Maxwells Brewery and Pub;Amber with light tan head.No noticeable aroma.Light wheat malt flavor is quite antiseptic
Maxwells Red Roaster;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Maxwells Brewery and Pub;Had on tap at the brewpub in Port Townsend.

Good way to finish the evening at a great little brewpub.
Maxwells Red Roaster;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Maxwells Brewery and Pub;Not sure of what to stylistically make of this beer. Appealing maroon color with a light roast in the aroma though i could not coax more. An easy, lightly malty beer that is blandish.

A clear one, dark golden in color and with a dense, white head of finger-thick size. Quite fruity aroma with a sourish orange- and banana touch. Some sourish citrus juice in the flavor, with a generic fruityness, some banana and a spiced hint. Medium to thin on the palate, dry and lightly acidic. Lasting finish.

Illinois Newmarket Pale Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Illinois Brewing;On tap at the brewpub. Pours cloudy orange/gold. Virtually no aroma and barely a flavor either. Slight malt and just a hint of hoppiness. Mouthfeel is extremely thin and low carbonation.
Illinois Newmarket Pale Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Illinois Brewing;Picked up a growler of this at the GTMW thanks to the folks at Illinois Brewing: Poured a bright clear copper colour with really no head. IT had lost some carbonation. Mouthfeel was light and creamy, soft with floral notes abundant. Taste was flavorful- citrusy with soft lime andgrapefruit notes. But not as bold and hoppy as the description said.
Illinois Newmarket Pale Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Illinois Brewing;(Tap) Pours a light amber color with almost no head. Sweet, fruity aroma. Light hop notes in the taste. The fruity taste almost seems like a flaw. Could have been more hoppy and had a better mouthfeel. Not particularly good.
Illinois Newmarket Pale Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Illinois Brewing;From the tap this poured a pale amber with a white head that had no desire to do any lacing. The aroma is faint, but it presents some sweet caramel covered by grapefruit anmd pine hop scents. A bit thin, but I can forgive them that because of the hops. The grapefruit gets almost juicy in the flavor, balancing out nicely with the sweet malt. Good crisp, bitter finish. Pretty decent. Illinois Brewing Company, Bloomington, IL
Illinois Newmarket Pale Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Illinois Brewing;not sure i got a good sample of this one. ill try later to try it again and re rate. it was very sweet and a little watery. a good deal of citrus flavor, but that didnt taste like it came from the hops.
Illinois Newmarket Pale Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Illinois Brewing;Draft, at IBC. I can definitely find the Cascade hops advertised on its description, but I didnâ€™t find it to be especially hoppy for the style. Still some fruit taste that may be more from hops than esters.
Illinois Newmarket Pale Ale;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Illinois Brewing;Wonderful pale ale-the aroma was very piney/hoppy with a tad darker appearance than say SNPA-lots of lace and a smooth palate with a strong emphasis on Cascade hops. A good brew from an interesting brewery
Grumpy Troll Charlie's American Kolsch;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;This was just called Kolsch, but I assume it is the same beer. The body was light gold with a white head. The aroma was fesh bread dough with some whole wheat and some carrots. The taste was sweet potatoes with some dirt. The finish was honey ham.
Grumpy Troll Charlie's American Kolsch;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Little nose, but some lemon-orange comes through as it warms. Nice lacing. Quite bitter, not much malt, far and away the hoppiest beer at this place, just a bit of dry malt at the end.
Grumpy Troll Charlie's American Kolsch;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;KÃ¶lsch / KÃ¶lsch-Style;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Clear straw with a white head. Nice lace. Dry/sweet aroma. Dry candy corn flavors. Dry vanilla finish. A weird ale.

Grumpy Troll Oktoberfest;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Nice to see this one return after a nine-year absence. On draught at the Grumpy Troll brewpub in Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin. Pours a clear golden amber colored brew with an average off-white head the slowly dissipates and leaves behind some spotty lacing. Aroma of fruity and golden caramel malt with a hint of Scotch Ale character with a hint of melon. Taste is medium bodied, soft carbonation with flavors of toasted caramel malt, floral hops and some Munich and caramel multi-grain. Finish is semi-sweet, Vienna malty some a mild bitterness.
Grumpy Troll Oktoberfest;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Amber color with little/no head. Sweet malt and vinous aroma. Strong alcohol and malt flavors that are somewhat vinous. With the strengh and flavors, wonder if some strange gnome got into the yeast.
Grumpy Troll Oktoberfest;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Orangish red color, and an almost flowery aroma. I definately tasted apple in this, and think I noticed orange, caramel and cinnamon as well. Left kind of an acidic mouthfeel afterwards. Seemed to be too thick, almost syrupy. I need to try this again someday.

Grumpy Troll Grumpy Stout;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Terribly concocted and not to friendly. I had a sampler at the brewpub and was dissipointed to the fact that the bartender thought this was good stuff. I would recommend that if you visit the Grumpy Troll that you donâ€™t ask the bartenders what they think is the best brews on tap. It lacked the substantial feel of a stout and seemed rather thin. Rated in September of 2006 just to clarify that with the user by the name of grumpy troll.
Grumpy Troll Grumpy Stout;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Draught pint at the brewpub, mid-October 2006. Translucent, near-black body with a decent lasting frothy off-white head and nice thick lacing....milky chocolate at first in a nose that rapidly becomes roastier and sharper and hints of licorice which doesnâ€™t materialize enough for real excitement....some nice roastiness throughout the body, fairly fruity (berries) and slightly tart, dark chocolate touches....body could be fuller but itâ€™s really quite drinkable, definitely the best thing I had on this visit.
Grumpy Troll Grumpy Stout;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;The body was very dark brown with a light ruby color when held ot light. The khaki head was fairly thin on top. The aroma had lots of chocolate with coffee and some sweet oatmeal. The taste was light with some mild coffee and a a little bitof roast. There was also some milk chocolate in the smooth and light body. A lame stout that they describe as dry on their menu.
Grumpy Troll Grumpy Stout;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Dark Brown Coloring with Whisp of a White Ring. Chocolate and Coffee Roasts on the Nose. Very Light Mouthfeel...Certainly Not Robust with the Chocolate and Coffee Flavor but Still a Good Drinking Stout.
Grumpy Troll Grumpy Stout;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Black color with slightly red edges. Aroma of burnt coffee. Very watery body. The coffee is still there with a slight chocolate wrap.
Grumpy Troll Grumpy Stout;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;On tap at the Brewpub. Dark brown in color with a white head. Roasted and coffee-like aroma. Body is too light. Good lacing. Not an outstanding stout and slightly disappointing for this very good brewpub.
Grumpy Troll Grumpy Stout;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Worst looking stout ever - clear, translucent amber brown with a thin grey/white head. Roasted malt and cocoa powder aroma along with some walnuts. Smells like a potent red. Chocolate dryness attempts to satisfy its claim as a stout. Thatâ€™s pretty much as far as it gets. Dry and thin-bodied. Might be classified as a stout in a blind taste test, but I have serious reservations.
Grumpy Troll Grumpy Stout;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Beautiful looking beer. This beer does excite my tastebuds (mind you it was the last one I had, they were already pretty excited). A very good stout with no crappy aftertaste.
TwoRows Hartley Lager;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Tap. Pours reddish-brown. The pleasantries end there. Smells of raw hamburger meat, and it tastes like it smells except they bothered to add some peaty malt in the mix. Mouthfeel is unfortunately full. I fear I may have salmonella poisoning.
TwoRows Hartley Lager;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Slightly odd taste to it, golden brown color. Almost could taste the barley(I know that sound odd but I could). Weak flavor, thin tasting. Not really very good compared to some of their other beers.
Monte Carlo Orange Blossom Wheat;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;Tried this one at the Brewpub in the Monte Carlo Casino on a recent trip to Vegas. Really not a whole lot going on here, but it is what it is. This beer is pretty much their wheat beer with some orange flavor added. They float a orange in the glass when they serve it to you, and the sweet/cirtus orange flavor of this beer makes it refreshing. The beer pours to a slightly hazy, golden color with a tight, white head, and a moderate carbonation. The nose has light citrus notes of orange. The palate is lean, and smooth, with light flavors of tart wheat, and light citrus flavors. This beer finishes quickly with light orange flavors. A nice thirst quencher for hot weather, but a pretty average beer in every way.
Monte Carlo Orange Blossom Wheat;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;Golden orange with good off white head. Lighly spiced citus (orange nose) The flavor was more of orange peel rather than the fruit itself.
Dubuque Simpatico Amber;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dubuque Brewing;From old tasting notes. Orange amber liquid with a creamy beige head. Slightly sweet toasted malt nose. Tangy toasted malt flavor. Hints of citrus and cloves with a dry finish and aftertaste.
Dubuque Simpatico Amber;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dubuque Brewing;not bad, but iâ€™ve had way better. i didnâ€™t think they still made this until i got some the other day. i remember it being way better than it was
Dubuque Simpatico Amber;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dubuque Brewing;Pours thin and lifeless. Taste is like a barnyard, with lots of straw and animal dung. The hops are flat, the malt is raw, and everything else in this screams awful. Iâ€™m reminded of cooked beets while drinking this. Not suitable for anyone... except Will Smith.
Dubuque Simpatico Amber;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dubuque Brewing;Oh No!, they donâ€™t make this muck anymore?! Darn, shucks, crap, holy-cannoli! That is such a shame, if anyone ever liked this beer I feel bad.......GOOD
Dubuque Simpatico Amber;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dubuque Brewing;poured a clear reddish color with a very thin tan head. Aroma was sweet and malty. The was deffinitally a caramel presence in its aroma. Taste was light, almost delicate with a nice hoppy twang in the finish.
Dubuque Simpatico Amber;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dubuque Brewing;Bottle. What an interesting find in a small liquor store in Menlo Park, CA. How this beer ended up here I have no idea. A cloudy amber color with a tan head. Lots of caramel in the malty nose. A little tangy zest on the palate. Pretty good stuff.
Restorffs Pilsnar;Torshavn, Faroe Islands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Restorffs BryggjarÃ­;A surprise when it came on the market in 2002. It actually tastes really good! Tasted from a bottle. Nice golden colour with weak head. Malty aroma and a hint of corn. The taste is a bit sweet, malty and some good hint of corn. The yeast used for this pilsner is partly the same as used in a Carlsberg pilsner. Maybe thatÂ´s why is has such a good taste.

Restorffs Pilsnar;Torshavn, Faroe Islands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Restorffs BryggjarÃ­;A yellow beer with a thin disappearing white head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of straw as well as corn. The flavor is sweet and very light with notes of corn and hints of honey on a thin body, and leading to a slightly bitter end. Iâ€™m confused about the corn notes I pick up - the label claims that brewing cereal has been added, but the brewer claims it is an all grain beer - but I have never tasted such a thin all grain beer and I pick up notes from corn. Weird.
Restorffs Pilsnar;Torshavn, Faroe Islands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Restorffs BryggjarÃ­;The best pilsener of the Faroe Islands. Fantastic fruity and spicy aroma. Nice refreshing flavour with a hoppy finish.
Restorffs Pilsnar;Torshavn, Faroe Islands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Restorffs BryggjarÃ­;The best pilsener from the Faroe Islands. A funny aroma, different fruit notes, maybe abricot? Quite good pilsener for the mighty people of the Foroe Islands.

Crested Butte White Buffalo Peace Ale;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Crested Butte Brewing;Old rating. 2006 national western stockshpw. We were late for the mutton busting, so we cut through the stockyard. We happened upon a cage with several of the rare white buffalo. On the pen were two bottles of this beer and a snickers bar, possibly an homage to the elusive beast, either way we drank the beer and ate the candy bar. A magical night, I remember almost nothing about the beer except that it was plain and magical,.

Crested Butte White Buffalo Peace Ale;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Crested Butte Brewing;"Taster at a local. This is obviously no longer an Amber, and the breweries web site calls it an American Pale Ale. Pours a thin white head, over a clear, yellow (SRM 3) body....nose is light cereal, grass....taste is cereal, light malts, finishing with a light hop bitterness....mouth feel is light, carbonation medium. While it is nicely balanced it is a light version of a Pale Ale. This would be a pleasant ""patio beer"". BJCP 6/3/11/4/5"
Crested Butte White Buffalo Peace Ale;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Crested Butte Brewing;"Bottle.

Crested Butte White Buffalo Peace Ale;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Crested Butte Brewing;Draft: Clear and light amber. Smooth but light body went down fairly easy.

Crested Butte White Buffalo Peace Ale;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Crested Butte Brewing;"i earned my thirst the hard way, toiling up a dusty colorado hillside, sweating enough to irrigate an acre of mojave mangoes. back home after my exertion, and gasping like a fish out of water, i could have drenched that thirst with tap water, but being a major beer geek, i reached for a bomber of local brew-- in this case, a crested butte white buffalo. it was terrifically quenching, owing largely to itâ€™s resemblance to cold water. this beer has some caramelly aspects, mostly in the color, being a shade of golden-orange suitable to caramel corn-- it has visible veins of something i guess to be yeast, so, given the name ""white"" i was ready to assume it was loosely in the wit style. it isnâ€™t. is ""weenie"" a style? itâ€™s understated aroma is butterscotch, and dry grassy hops. the head was not disposed to exertion and napped all the while i was taking tastes and notes--and, rather than waking up refreshed, merely lapsed into a coma and died. it quaffs nicely-- with little to either excite approbation or ignite condemnation to the dozing taste buds it glides over. itâ€™s carbonation is mild, itâ€™s body is like water-- only more so. a slight apricot-tort flavor, a touch of yeast and a brief distress signal of bitterness from a lost detatchment of hops. hereâ€™s everything you adore in a cold glass of water, plus a cute beer accent and a pleasant buzz."

Cerveza Potosina Blanca Pilsener;Potosi, Bolivia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Nacional Potosi;From my pre-RB days, I drank this in bottles/cans when in Potosi, Bolivia. It was a typical macro-lager that in essence was inoffensive and unmemorable drunk cold in the city of itâ€™s birth (i.e. fresh). Light bodied, deep gold, fizzy carbonation - refreshing on a bright sunny hot Potosi day. Given as an offering to the gods of the Potosi silver mines along with coca leaves...
Cerveza Potosina Blanca Pilsener;Potosi, Bolivia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Nacional Potosi;My Bottom Line: Rubber soles, erasers and gasoline whiffs waft through this industrial lagerâ€™s hay-like cereals. Further Personal Perceptions: -A thin veil of foam skirts the light straw. -This is so far from a good Pils, itâ€™s scary. -This makes Pacena look like a goddamn masterpiece. -I usually avoid beers that could be awful (or awfully boring) like this. But I admit, once in a while, itâ€™s nice to remind oneself of how low a brewery can go. Can.

Cerveza Potosina Negra Malta;Potosi, Bolivia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cerveceria Nacional Potosi;Smokey blackcurrant aroma and flavour. Chocolate comes though in the end but is too sweet and syrupy to be served at room temp. Unfortunately no-one seems to have a fridge here in Potosi.
Old Yale Sergeants IPA;Chilliwack, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Old Yale Brewing Co;Middling brown body, soft head on top. Very vague malt aroma with nothing else coming through. Flavour is a coppery malt, soft sharp hops, sweet mud. An old style craft beer approach, okay carbonation. Works well as a malty brew but also pretty standard.
Old Yale Sergeants IPA;Chilliwack, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Old Yale Brewing Co;Pours hazy pale amber with three fingers of rocky white head, excellent retention and heavy, chunky lacing. (4/5) Nose is brett and not much else. (4/10) Taste is moderate sweet, moderate funk, mild bitter. (4/10) Medium body, moderate carbonation, mild bitter and funky finish. (3/5) Utterly dominated by a brett infection. Almost no hops left at all - none in the nose and limited amounts on the tongue. Not a bad drink even in the condition itâ€™s in - almost has a saison character - but thereâ€™s no way itâ€™s supposed to taste like this. And NO DAMN BOTTLE DATE, so no way to know whether this is just a function of it being on a shelf too long. Deeply disappointing, but Iâ€™m gonna have to do what I said Iâ€™d do: if you donâ€™t date your bottle, I assume you meant it to taste this way. Rating this as an E/IPA, itâ€™s a massive fail. (6/20)

Rock Bottom Black Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;On-tap @ Rock Bottom, Pgh, PA. Pours black with thick creamy white head, guinness like. Aroma faint, but of malts. Flavor was of slightly roasted coffee. Some bitterness in the middle, ending with a sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel was creamy. Full bodied. This had to be a stout, certainly not an ale, but it was good, by far one of the better rock bottom beers.
Rock Bottom Black Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Pours very black and creamy...think that had it on a nitro. Aroma is soft. Flavor is creamy and a bit chocolately. Definitely not an ale...either a stout or porter. Very reminiscent of a old dominion stout I had on nitro. Mouthfeel was very creamy. Also...the alcohol on the board said 5.2.
Rock Bottom Black Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Nice black appearance with a full creamy head.

Rock Bottom Goat-Toppler;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;On tap @ 2011 Craft Lager Fest. Clear brilliant gold with a white thin head. Aroma of body odor and light toast. Kinda smells like my dirty hippie friend after he doesnâ€™t shower for a few days (sorry, Josh). Tastes like smoky dry pale malt, bad toast, and stale toffee. A pretty big letdown.
Rock Bottom Goat-Toppler;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;On tap at the brewpub. Poured a clear golden-yellow color with a thin white head that faded to a ring. Aroma of of sweet malt, honey, a light spiciness, and a faint grassiness. Smooth, sweet entry with some caramel and honey leads into a spicy, dry yeastiness that lingers into a moderately dry finish where it is paired with a faint grassy hoppiness. Full mouth feel is offset by the dryness on the finish, combining to provide a nice, drinkable beer considering the ABV. Overall, my review really doesnâ€™t do this one justice. There was more going on than I could accurately describe, but it was there. I need to try it again sometime and see if I can do any better.

Rock Bottom Goat-Toppler;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;The folks at my local Rock Bottom in King of Prussia, PA call this a maibock, but I guess a dunkler bock will do. Maibocks used to be one of my favorite styles, before I discovered the joys that are IPAs. This beer pours a brown color with a bit of an orange hue. The head is off-white with good lacing. The nose is full of sweet malts, bread, yeast and earth. The flavors are extremely malty and rich. The finish leaves a smooth, almost creamy-like tone. This bock beer is done very well.

Rock Bottom Goat-Toppler;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;The Rock Bottom set of reviews is a reflection of my hasty attempt to drink a small quantity of many beers and produce accurate and helpful reviews. Clearly Iâ€™ve failed, but I hope my incoherent and cryptic critiques can help at least a few folks who wander in and want to know what to order. Before the look, nose and taste can even be considered, I have to laud the folks at Rock Bottom for a great name. Even if the Goat Toppler tastes like a Turkish bath house, I could spend hours daydreaming of clumsy, inebriated goats, which is better entertainment than any show on television. The raging booziness of the Goat Toppler glows a semi-cloudy blend of oranges and reds, and reeks of hard liquor like a flavored Bacardi rum. Thankfully the taste is nothing like the smell, showing off a prominent banana flavor with a lace of green apples. Sadly, the high alcohol content cloys an otherwise skillfully concocted brew. At least the name is immutably cool.

Tried this one at a beer festival and would like to visit the pub and have one there. I will update my notes when I do.

Big River Sawmill Alley Brown Ale (formerly: Nutbrown);Richmond, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;BRB (Be Right Back - Big River);Also had the vanilla/honey cask version of this. All told the many flavours confused the palate, with the sweetness of the honey battling the slightly burnt vanilla for dominance.
Big River Sawmill Alley Brown Ale (formerly: Nutbrown);Richmond, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;BRB (Be Right Back - Big River);Had this in a cask, primed with Honey and Vanilla. Very dark brown, with a molasses nose and the very faintest touch of a head. The vanilla was very overbearing. I found this beer too sweet in general - maybe it was just the cask.
Big River Sawmill Alley Brown Ale (formerly: Nutbrown);Richmond, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;BRB (Be Right Back - Big River);Tried at a beer festival. I believe my notes reflect that because my ratings are much lower than for those who have tried the brew at the brewpub. I should mention also that generally this is not my favorite style. A thin and disappointing texture with a correspondingly light to medium body. Alright. It is fresh beer.
Big River Sawmill Alley Brown Ale (formerly: Nutbrown);Richmond, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;BRB (Be Right Back - Big River);(Draught) Sampled on November 23rd, 2006 at the brewpub. Thin white head with a red-brown body. Nutty roasted malt nose. Toasted flavour has an almost sugarless cocoa powder and marzipan undertone. Nice complex and easy to drink!
Big River Fur Trader Pale Ale;Richmond, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;BRB (Be Right Back - Big River);On tap at Big River, pours a hazy amber / copper with a small beige head. Aroma brings out English malt, light spice, and bready notes. Flavour is very malty and somewhat sweet for a pale ale, with bready notes and sweet caramel malt. Not cloying, but not exactly a refined example of an English pale ale. Passable but not too thrilling.

I liked this the least of the bunch I tried - it hardly tasted like a Pale Ale. Pours a foamy, medium white head and a low carbonated orange body. Nose is highly caramel malted with undertones of butterscotch. Astringent, bitter hops donâ€™t meld well with the strong English malt. Was more like an Amber Ale to me.

Tang of sour suggesting things arenâ€™t quite right; rhubarby, redcurranty notes, earthiness, mildew.. stirred with a Twiglet. The dominant note is vomit if Iâ€™m honest. Sloppy to flat condition.

I really felt that took away from it as it overwhelmed the flavor. Not much of a brew, I gotta say it was just a little dull. Not a typical wheat either. Eh...

Taps Bohemian Pilsener;Tustin, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Taps Brewery & Barrel Room;08-Oct-12 (12-oz sample bottle with a competition label only: Obtained 02-May-12 for stewarding the 2012 World Beer Cup in San Diego, CA) There's nothing like a nice, crisp Pilsener, and this beer hits the spot. It pours a hazy, straw-colored body capped by a creamy, white head that settles to a quarter-inch blanket and hold there for the duration. The nose is mostly hoppy, offering a generally vegetal aroma of cut grass, but also a bit of graininess from the malt. The palate is similar, with minimally sweet, grainy and cereal malt flavors backed by gently bitter, grassy hops. The grassiness lingers quite awhile, but modest toastiness emerges late. There's a hint of medicine and metal far in the background that's mostly noticeable only after a burp. Light in body, dry, medium in carbonation, generally refreshing and easy drinking. Overall, not especially noteworthy as Pilseners go, but still pleasant and enjoyable.
Taps Bohemian Pilsener;Tustin, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Taps Brewery & Barrel Room;brilliant, smells of floral hops and a touch of sweet malt. Taste is crisp and nice bitterness. The taste of the floral hops is even more noticeable with a touch of citrus.

Taps Bohemian Pilsener;Tustin, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / SvetlÃ½;Taps Brewery & Barrel Room;A: The pour is a clear golden straw color with a couple of fingers of white head. S: Not a terribly fragrant beer. Mild malt aroma with some hints of bread. Floral and citrus hops start to come through a little bit as I stick my nose almost in the beer. Perhaps some fruit esters? T: Not a terribly traditional flavor. Quite a hoppy beer for a Czech style pils, and some definite citrus notes in addition to the floral ones. Sweet pale malts and a hint of corn. Yeast is present and there is a mild bitterness on the back end. M: Light to medium in body with a moderate level of carbonation. O: A fairly good beer, but not exactly what I was expecting to get from this one.

Dominion Victory Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draught. Slightly hazy gold with white head. Aroma is faint malt and citrus, taste is same. Nothing to get excited about.
Dominion Victory Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Wonderland Ballroom, DC tap ($6): This was advertised as a unfiltered, unpastuerized lager when I was there, but I guess this is an ale. It makes sense looking in retrospect. Pours a copper color with an ok sized head. Citrus hops and light malts. Taste is pretty much the same. A session ale without very much offensive things in there. But, this was and is utterly forgettable.
Dominion Victory Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draft at Greenleafe tavern. Dark straw color with nose of slight fruit, hopcitrus, and pale malt. Tastes as it smells, with some malt flavor matched by mild hopcitrus and fruity notes.

Dominion Victory Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);On tap at the brewpub, RBSG 2006. An orange beer with no head - from the looks of it - my guess would be a Pale ale not an Amber. The aroma is sweet malty with light hoppy notes. The flavor is sweet hoppy with notes of caramel. An OK beer - but nothing special about it.
Dominion Victory Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - English;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);On tap at the brewpub, RBSG 2006. Clear gold with almost no head. A pretty standard, blah amber. Meh. Decent maltiness, short on hops.

Just back from walking on the walls of Troy at Sun-set - a truly awesome and emotional experience. The beer is better than Efes Light.

Troy Dark;Izmir, Turkey;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;TÃ¼rk Tuborg;Why does a dark beer come in a clear bottle? Dont know if this beer have had to much sun, but this was a very thin beer. No aroma, very little taste and a thin palate.

Troy Dark;Izmir, Turkey;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;TÃ¼rk Tuborg;Clear glass bottle with the Trojan horse logo and the name of the beer embossed on the glass. The colour is a smokey amber, like a scarlet tinged tea - quite attractive. Aroma is a mix of faint smokey malt and CO2. Mouthfeel is thin to light medium with some light but harsh carbonation. Taste is of cold stewed weak tea and a vague medicine. Not great. In fact, fairly poor. Troy is not seen around as much as the main Tuborg brands, while Tuborg, although seen in every town, can't compete with the overwhelming popularity (and better quality) of Efes.
Troy Dark;Izmir, Turkey;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;TÃ¼rk Tuborg;Brown coloured. Awful skunky smell of rotten meat and fish. Thin and watery. Very bad.

Trumer Weizen;Salzburg-Obertrum, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Trumer Privatbrauerei Josef Sigl;This is a superb example for a nice Hefeweizen. So far the best I found from an Austrian brewer.

Trumer Weizen;Salzburg-Obertrum, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Trumer Privatbrauerei Josef Sigl;perfect wheat beer, full body, harmony to the bitterness, not to little in hops, but typically for the style interessting fruit flavour not only bananas like all thr rest
Trumer Weizen;Salzburg-Obertrum, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Trumer Privatbrauerei Josef Sigl;330ml bottle (Stockmann, Tallinn) 5+ without yeast, just a few spikes of bananaey esters. With all the yeast, itâ€™s mellowed, but less interesting, and in fact rather dull. 3 You could pour this clear if you wanted to, but if you swirl the bottle, you get a hazy pale orange with quite a bit of sinky chunks, a bit off-puting. 5+ Fairly dull weizen taste. Pre-swirling, it was prety OK estery krystalweizen. After adding the yeast, itâ€™s breadier, and the banana is again more rounded and mellowed. do prefer the latter. 3 Crisp carbonation, a refreshin g but full palate. Finish quite bready, and with an OK bitter bite, but thereâ€™s no fullness to the hops, no aromaticity. But even the biteâ€™s better than nothing. 11 Sounds worse than it was. It was pretty acceptable, but lacking the wow a good hefe can bring.

Trumer Weizen;Salzburg-Obertrum, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Trumer Privatbrauerei Josef Sigl;14th December 2007 Draughft in Salzburg, Austria. Very dry and frothy. A lively minerally start leads to a bitter bubblegum. Interesting!
Trumer Weizen;Salzburg-Obertrum, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Trumer Privatbrauerei Josef Sigl;Bottled(500ml). -Weizen by the book. Cloudy dark orange coloured, typical big head for this style, banana nose. Banana is dominant here. Pleasant wheaty and spicy with acidic lemony finish.Very refreshing.

JT Schmids California Hefeweizen;Anaheim, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;JT Schmids Brewhouse & Eatery;Lemon wedge takes up a quarter of the sample glass. Cloudy and dark. Lemony. Tastes like citrus juice. Can almost taste the pulp. Nice-ish, but a Hefe?
JT Schmids California Hefeweizen;Anaheim, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;JT Schmids Brewhouse & Eatery;Tap at the Tustin venue. Pours murky gold with a creamy white head.

JT Schmids California Hefeweizen;Anaheim, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;JT Schmids Brewhouse & Eatery;Tap at the brewpub. Hefeweizen. Pours a full haze light golden, great sheets of white lacing. Mild estery nose with light pear. Taste is a bit papery, sharper grain husky. Newspaper like palate. A bit harsh around the edges. Thinner body for style.
JT Schmids California Hefeweizen;Anaheim, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;JT Schmids Brewhouse & Eatery;On tap at the brewpub. Itâ€™s an unclear, yellow brew topped by a small, white head. The aroma is dominated by bubblegum, the banana is left in the background along with some lemon and a faint hint of cloves. Thereâ€™s a very faint bitterness in the flavor, not much sweetness either, and thereâ€™s both bubblegum, banana, citrus and wheat. The cloves more or less gone. A bit thin on the palate, and with a quite low level of carbonation, at least considering the style. Anyway, itâ€™s a decent, drinkable beer, but itâ€™s nothing impressive going on here. 130903
JT Schmids California Hefeweizen;Anaheim, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;JT Schmids Brewhouse & Eatery;"Horrible example of a hefe. Not enough carbonation, no real flavor except the lemon they serve in it ( if its a ""California"" hefe, shouldnâ€™t they put avocado in it?), only slightly cloudy. Donâ€™t bother."

JT Schmids California Hefeweizen;Anaheim, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;JT Schmids Brewhouse & Eatery;Sample at the brewery. Rating #21. Cloudy and dense yellow pour and a tight bubbled head. Light banana and lemon aroma, pretty nice. Flavor is more on the citrus side, more lemon with a light aftertaste. Pretty good. (1794)
JT Schmids California Hefeweizen;Anaheim, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;JT Schmids Brewhouse & Eatery;A: As a hefeweizen should, this one pours a cloudy golden orange with a creamy white head. S: Amazingly, I get banana as the initial aroma. However, there is still the good olâ€™ lemon zest/peel that shouldnâ€™t really be there. Lots of pepper and an overcooked grain smell. Mild cloves give it a tad more authenticity. T: Though the aroma had some high points, the flavor is not very good. Light and watery to start with. Thereâ€™s a decent spiciness with some pepper and mild clove. A bit of banana and citrus peel. Itâ€™s also pretty bitter. M: Medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation. O: I got my hopes up after the first sniff, but I was let down.
Atlantic MacFoochies 7+ Scottish Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Atlantic Brewing Company;Caught between being a scotch ale (as it is categorized) and a Scottish ale (as it is named). Definitely has the scotch taste but not the nice smooth maltiness.
Atlantic MacFoochies 7+ Scottish Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Atlantic Brewing Company;This is the second offering from these folks that I must assume is spoiled. The pour is dark with minimal head. Aroma is vinous with a strong peat pretense. Flavor is that of red wine thatâ€™s opened too long - slightly vinegar, and sour grape. The fizziness of carbonation just make this seem like a bad wine cooler. Really a shame, as Scottish ales are one of my favorite styles, and I had big hope. But between this and the Real Ale, Iâ€™m thinking either they have serious quality control issue, or just make really awful beer.
Atlantic MacFoochies 7+ Scottish Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Atlantic Brewing Company;Bottle into glass. Opaque dark brown. Sweet malt with a touch of hops on the nose, in the mouth very full. A bit sweet, almost cloying. Moderate finish, leaves a bit if stickiness. Ok, comes scoffs as a higher ABV red, and I want it to be easier going.
Atlantic MacFoochies 7+ Scottish Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Atlantic Brewing Company;Attractive w/ very nice aroma. The taste is just a touch underwhelming. It has that boozy Scottish feel but is lacking in the caramel that makes scots great. Still a sold beer as a whole tho!
Atlantic MacFoochies 7+ Scottish Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Atlantic Brewing Company;Bien maltÃ©. On sent un petit cÃ´tÃ© fumÃ©. Assez douce en bouche et un goÃ»t de cafÃ© sâ€™installe en finale
Atlantic MacFoochies 7+ Scottish Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Atlantic Brewing Company;Bottle. Sweet light molasses aroma with a fruity and herbal floral character. Opaque dark, ruddy brown under a quickly dropping off-white sheet. Sweet brown sugar flavour with low bitterness and very faint fruitiness. Medium body, low to moderate carbonation, sweet finish.
Atlantic MacFoochies 7+ Scottish Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Atlantic Brewing Company;Pours dark brown with a frothy tan khaki head. Light aromas of smoked peat, toffee and caramel. Tastes more of the same with the caramel sweetness a little more pronounced. Good thick body. Overall a good solid beer but not spectacular.
Atlantic MacFoochies 7+ Scottish Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Atlantic Brewing Company;650ml bottle. Dark brown colour, thin tan head. Not a strong aroma, faint smoked peat, spring water. Taste is very mild, brown ale malt, kind of. Thick and creamy body. Overall, I didnâ€™t get much from this, but what there was wasnâ€™t bad.
Atlantic MacFoochies 7+ Scottish Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Atlantic Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a dark brown body with a finger of tan foamy head, no lacing. The smell was smoky/ roasty through light coffee, light chocolate, and malts. The taste was mostly sweet, eventually gets some bitter qualities through previously mentioned flavors. On the palate, it sat about a medium on the body, was pretty smooth, sessionable, bitter yet somewhat sweet aftertaste and finish. Overall, this was a pretty good Scottish ale Id probably have again.
Atlantic MacFoochies 7+ Scottish Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Atlantic Brewing Company;On draft at City Swiggers. A malty, lightly smoky & bitter Scot, pretty dry for the style. Solid, but unspectacular.
Kennebec Cream Ale;Gardiner, Maine, United States;Cream Ale;Kennebec Brewing Company;Pours copper with a thin white head. Smells and tastes of light malt with some peppery hints. Straight forward version of the style.
Kennebec Cream Ale;Gardiner, Maine, United States;Cream Ale;Kennebec Brewing Company;"Bomber consumed on 8/24/07, purchased fresh from the cooler at Downeast Beverage. Medium-sized white head rises up initially and falls down to cover, leaving little/no lace. Drab golden colored body is awash in carbonation. Clarity is high. Stale hops, that this brewer seems to love (see their stout) give a papery/musty/earthy touch as plentiful minerals and definite flaws make themselves known (acetyldehyde, vanillin, waxines, heavy mineral notes). Some pale malts add a touch of honey but are at extreme odds with the ""hard water"" smell and overpowering blandness/mustiness here. Vegetal, musty flavors at work in the beer mostly hide the underattenuated, mushy pale malt sweetness as acetyldehyde and stale, musty hop notes go nowhere. Not oxidized, just not well-lagered, it seems, nor is there any malt or yeast crispness that Iâ€™d expect out of a low gravity golden ale. Seems rather filtered as well, leading to some thinning on the end and no bottled yeast to uptake the diacetyl that this yeast pumps out. Hopefully these beers are much better on draught, because thereâ€™s no excuse for this low level of quality in bottles. Love the guyâ€™s obviously biased rating of this (honestbrewer) who rags on other people for being biased in their ratings."
Kennebec Cream Ale;Gardiner, Maine, United States;Cream Ale;Kennebec Brewing Company;(22oz bottle) Fine particulate in cloudy apple juice body, topped by large off-white head that mostly diminishes. Aroma is medium sweet, spice, some bread, lemon, light herbal. Taste is medium sweet, lemon, some bread, spice, light herbal. Light-medium body. I have little doubt that this is infected -- the lemon is uncharacteristic of the style, and make this seem much more like a golden ale. In this case, Iâ€™m guessing this is a good thing.
Kennebec Cream Ale;Gardiner, Maine, United States;Cream Ale;Kennebec Brewing Company;Finest example of this style found to date. Light clean and refreshing. YOu should try it on tap and the rating only goes up. You should see the lines for this companyâ€™s beers at any brewfest!! 10x longer than ony other. He must be doing it right!! All others are just jealous! DOnâ€™t be fooled by oxidized bottles that idiot storeowners leave out of the cooler. This goes for all beers from any brewery!
Kennebec Cream Ale;Gardiner, Maine, United States;Cream Ale;Kennebec Brewing Company;Pours a two-finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving traces of lace. Almost clear pale amber color. Slight hoppy nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is balanced, fruity? hoppy finish. $3.50 for a 22oz bottle from Tullyâ€™s Beer & Wine Wells, Me.
Kennebec Cream Ale;Gardiner, Maine, United States;Cream Ale;Kennebec Brewing Company;Nice light orange pour with at first a big white foam head. Smells like biscuits and 2 row pale malt. Mouthfeel is bad, pretty much water. Iâ€™d heard this was the brewers staple beer, i think their ESB is much better and this is pretty much one I could have gone without.
Kennebec Cream Ale;Gardiner, Maine, United States;Cream Ale;Kennebec Brewing Company;(22 oz. bottle) Hazy yellow-gold pour, big foamy white head. Aroma nicely bready at first, but then later starts smelling like old laundry or something. Poor lacing. Very dry mouthfeel, watery, prickly. Tastes cheap, sour. Like a really bad pale lager. Oh well.
Kennebec Cream Ale;Gardiner, Maine, United States;Cream Ale;Kennebec Brewing Company;Excellent beer. Again, I may be accused of being biased, but this is probably the best ale Iâ€™ve had. Iâ€™m not much of an ale person, but this is one Iâ€™ll be drinking more often. Slightly sweet, kind of creamy taste with a hint of fruit, good smelling. Goes down easy. Excellent beer. Better than the stout even (which I also reccomend)
Kennebec Cream Ale;Gardiner, Maine, United States;Cream Ale;Kennebec Brewing Company;From a 22oz bottle. Pours hazy pale orange with an off-white creamy head. Smells of citrus and spice. Orange and lemon aromas. Sweet malt. Tastes of sweet pale malt with the orange and lemon undertones. Lightly spicy with a light airy hops finish. Smooth and creamy. Love me some cream ale... Crisp and sweet. Very drinkable. A very good cream ale.
Kennebec Cream Ale;Gardiner, Maine, United States;Cream Ale;Kennebec Brewing Company;Creamy but not quite creamy enough (body was just a tad too light). I did love the underlying flavor though, subtly sweet malts with little need for balancing, which was nonetheless accomplished with a perfect proportion of hops.
Maine Coast Oktoberfest;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;"""A little too light alaround for my taste. The look was in between what you usually see in the style and a standard yellow lager. Aroma was nice but you had to work for it...subtle caramel and toasty malt. Flavor and feel pretty light as well. More a summer beer than a fall seasonal. Kind of a miss."""
Maine Coast Oktoberfest;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;MÃ¤rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Not up to par with their imperial stout. A decent Octoberfest but not best of show. There was nothing wrong with this, but it lacked anything truly distinctive to make it ''great.'' On par for the course.
Narrow Gauge (Maine) Light Wheat;Farmington, Maine, United States;Wheat Ale;Narrow Gauge Brewing Company;Not so much ''light'', I think the name distinguishes it from their dunkel weizen. This is basically a regular American wheat. Fairly well done, not over-hopped as many are, nice cloudy beer with medium-bodied mouthfeel, citrusy flavor with a nice yeasty aftertaste. Not bad at all.
Sebago Bass Ackwards Blueberry Ale;Gorham, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sebago Brewing Company;Old notes. This is not this yearâ€™s edition (2012 edition), sorry for only finding the notes now. At the brewpub in South Portland, Maine. This was poured into a snifter, uh...ok, I guess Iâ€™m not going to argue but itâ€™s just a fruit beer, well hereâ€™s the rest. The appearance was a nice hazy dark brown close to light purple tinges along the sides of the glass. Thereâ€™s a decent light sliding lacing trickling down the sides of the glass. The smell had the blueberry obviously up front. It comes in fairly hard with a nice drive of some light malts to back it all up. The taste was mainly sweet through the blueberry and the malts. It leaves a decent sweet sticky blueberry aftertaste and a super refreshing finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was mainly subdued and lets the blueberry just coat my mouth and tongue. Overall, this was a pretty good beer to have as a dessert on late Summer in the evening. I actually remember buying at least 3 bombers of this to have on Sebago Lake just to watch the Sun go down with my olâ€™ hound dog curled up by ma feet at the olâ€™ lake house.
Sebago Bass Ackwards Blueberry Ale;Gorham, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sebago Brewing Company;Dark orange-brown color with a white head. Hazy.

Sebago Bass Ackwards Blueberry Ale;Gorham, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sebago Brewing Company;Poured from a 750ml. bottle into a Budweiser pint glass. The color is hazy maroon/amber with a slight wisp of head and no lacing left on the glass. There a slight blueberry aroma in the nose but the malts tend to play a little difficult game of cat and mouse. It is hard to really place the just about all the aromas but it is a bit spicy. The taste is has a bit of berry but there is something that hold off identifying things a bit. There is a slight bit of juicy flavor that has some blueberry muffin flavor and a malt bready flavor. There is a sugary flavor as it goes down and it has total attention till the end where is some slight bitterness. The feel of this beer is as expected. A beer that is a little hard to cover at first but them is all about making things right. It goes from too sweet to just right and really goes down without a thought.
Sebago Bass Ackwards Blueberry Ale;Gorham, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sebago Brewing Company;22oz bottle pours a translucent, ruby amber with a thin, creamy white head. Nose is nice, berry, sweet, jammy. Flavor is nice too, berry, light vanilla, lightly malty, candy. Medium bodied. Lots of good, fresh blueberry flavor.
Sebago Bass Ackwards Blueberry Ale;Gorham, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sebago Brewing Company;On tap at Sebago Portland , ME location. Pours out dark amber topped with a small head. Aroma was of very light blueberries and sweet malts. Taste was just a hint of blueberries and to think that Maine is the larges producing state for blueberries they should have been over flowing in this beer. Better luck on the next batch maybe double the blue berries.
Sebago Bass Ackwards Blueberry Ale;Gorham, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sebago Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub as Blueberry Single Batch Series. Weak fruity aroma, hint of butter. Almost clear deep red colour. Small white head. The flavour is fruity, but not with a great amount of berry. Not that sweet either.

Russian River Dam Stout;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Stout;Russian River Brewing;Roasted nuts and bittersweet chocolate nose. Herbal and earthy palate with notes of tobacco, leather and spiced cocoa. Very creamy mouthfeel with a very nice mocha finish.
Russian River Dam Stout;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Stout;Russian River Brewing;Black..creamy tan head..big creamy coffee aroma with hints of chocolate..strong coffee flavor with a hint of bitterness at the end..creamy mouthfeel..
Russian River Dam Stout;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Stout;Russian River Brewing;Another award winner by Vinnie...i swear this thing was hopped up on nitro and a few of my tablemates agreed. This one poured a glacial black with absolutely no hints of any other color to be found when held up to the light. This was just about the only Vinnie beer to have a head...beige and tan colored, BEYOND CREAMY and INVITING...good lacing and excellent head retention throughout. The aroma is purely coffee, vanilla, smokiness, and alcohol. The taste is that of coffee and roastiness with a very slight hint to the alcohol that lies within. It ends very smoothly with a mildly malty finish. Also during this aftertaste something to effects of mocha and aged wood come into the tasting...just superb. The carbonation is just excellent here...nice bubbles accumulating at the bottom of the pint glass only to assault the palate and leave a foamy creaminess of roast and smokey wood. I cant help it...i''m just stunned..that is one DAM good STOUT!!!

Pacific Rim Ring of Fire Pepper Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;For a pepper beer this one is pretty good. Clear maber with a dense manilla head. Straight up jalapeno aroma. the flavor is not so over the top like some other pepper beers. The heat is just enought i be felt and the pepper flavor is not overdone. Slight burning of the palate. Not bad but it is still a pepper beer, More novelty than anything.
Pacific Rim Ring of Fire Pepper Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Finally a pepper beer I like! Clear amber body with retentive off-white head. Aroma is medium sweet, jalapeno. Taste is medium sweet, jalapeno, light caramel. Very drinkable stylewise -- yes itâ€™s pepper, but not overwhelming, just there to provide flavor. No attempt to blow you out of the water, only a mild burn in the swallow. Rated more to style, as this is the best chili beer Iâ€™ve ever had.
Pacific Rim Ring of Fire Pepper Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;The wonderful smell of fresh Jalapenos in that regard this is very well crafted beer. But this baby is unpleasant and harsh and while this may well be as good a fresh pepper beer as can be make itâ€™s just not good beer. Just give up on the idea and eat your peppers on the side. Try this beer if you must.
Pacific Rim Ring of Fire Pepper Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Decent amber color--I could tell from the first sniff that this would exhibit better craftmanship than the godawful Cave Creek Chili beer. Though not listed in the commercial description, I sensed Green bell peppers in the aroma--reminding me of a nice bisque enjoyed in Port Angeles. Unfortunately, the flavor was rather harsh--not so bad as the aforementioned Cave Creek beer, but bad enough for me to pour most of it out. I suppose if I were to like pepper beer, I would like this one??
Pacific Rim Ring of Fire Pepper Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;They have this every year at the Washington Summer Microbrew Festival in Kirkland.

Peter B's Seven Malt Stout;Monterey, California, United States;Stout;Peter B's Brewpub;Pours a deep dark near black color with a thin tan head.

Vermont Pub Dogbite Special Reserve;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Strong Ale - English;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a semi-burnt orange close to light muddy brown color. Slim cap of a white foamy head. Slow dissipation. No lacing. The aroma smells like pine nuts and dried grass with sweet booze. Dried dark fruits, brown sugar, and subtle light wood. The flavor steers to the sweet side through a blend of the previously mentioned aromas. Sly dark fruity/boozy aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fair with a sly accepatable sticikiness to it. Overall, an ESB that wants to be an English Strong ale. Does it? Sligtly, well, in VPBâ€™s fun and creative sort of way. Good for what it is.
Vermont Pub Dogbite Special Reserve;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Strong Ale - English;Vermont Pub & Brewery;on tap-pours a tight light tan head that laces and hazy amber color. Aroma is sweet light malt/grain, some earthy hops. Taste is sweet light malt/grain, secondry earthy hops, with the hops carrying through on the after taste. More SB/Bitter than ESB.
Vermont Pub Dogbite Special Reserve;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Strong Ale - English;Vermont Pub & Brewery;"On tap. Similar to the cask-conditioned version of the regular Dogbite, this Special Reserve has a slightly stronger alcohol profile, more vanilla nd plum notes in the (superb) flavor and is more complex and multifaceted than its cousin. Super-smooth, creamy, medium-bodied start, strong piney hop profile in the middle and an amazing long dry champagny finish; aroma probably deserves better but will have to wait until I can get a less smoke-influenced sample. Just great."
Ridge Honey Ale;Osoyoos, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ridge Brewing Company;"Draught at the brewpub Golden to amber color. Strangely the main flavor of this beer is oxidisation; poorish malt flavor, very light aroma, lowish bitterness. Forgettable."
Ridge Honey Ale;Osoyoos, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ridge Brewing Company;(Draught) Sampled at the brewpub on June 5, 2010. Astringent. Soapy water nose, somewhat lactic again â€“ as was the NGD. Sweet corn body. Honey? Well â€“ watery though. Reminds me of some of SKâ€™s less desirable brewpubs. 3/2/3/2/6
Ridge Honey Ale;Osoyoos, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ridge Brewing Company;Golden body with no head. Aroma is light malts and honey. Flavour is light with a creamy honey feel. Quick finish. A decent honey beer but nothing overly special.

Phillips Big Bad John Barleywine;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Phillips Brewing Co.;Pours a brown color with a small head. Great aromas of caramel, candy and spices. Sweet, spicy and slightly hoppy flavors. Interesting but too short and subtle.
Phillips Big Bad John Barleywine;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Phillips Brewing Co.;Caramel figures prominently in very fruity (plum), cookie-like aroma. Dark amber-brown with off-white head that recedes to decent cover. Marginal lace. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Slips down without a thought. Some sherry-like tones to a fruity caramel flavour. Does not deliver all the aroma promises but is rather enjoyable all the same. Complex aroma never quite materialize in the flavour or perhaps just donâ€™t marry well. Bottle (enjoyed with beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT and Rastacouere).
Phillips Big Bad John Barleywine;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Phillips Brewing Co.;Humid caramel nose hiding earthy yeastiness and grassy hops...Toffee candy smothers the tired mouthfeel but struggles to survive the big-bubbled carbonation...Not enough of a chatty malt to make pleasure last, but nonetheless interesting as a 3-year-old barley wine...
Phillips Big Bad John Barleywine;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Phillips Brewing Co.;Copper clear body with a short-lasting off-white head. Aroma is moderately alcoholic (serious rhum aspects), but also got interesting peat aspects, scotch ale caramelic. Palate also has those characteristics to which are added vinous grapes and butterscotch (and very buttery one at that). Were the carbonation a little lower, this would seem like a typical english barley wine, although a little astringent and thin-bodied.
Phillips Big Bad John Barleywine;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Phillips Brewing Co.;A deep mahagony color, a full nose of hazelnuts, dark rum, apples, raisins. The medium body, has brown sugar, raisins, dark rum and slightly syrupy while ending moderately bitter and rich. Very succulent and hides the 10.5% alcohol very well.
Phillips Big Bad John Barleywine;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Phillips Brewing Co.;Dark red/brown body with a massive rocky head that never fell. Aroma was malty and sweet with a presence of cherries. Flavour was sweet but overly alcoholic for my liking. The finish was long and smooth. Probably needs more time to develop.

Tegernseer Spezial;Tegernsee, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Herzoglich Bayerisches Brauhaus Tegernsee;Bottle courtesy of our log cabin landlord in Dachau, Bavaria, Germany. We're listening to the great Bicep album, Tuesday 15th January 2019. Pours gold, superb clarity, small white head. I was expecting a touch of cereal on the aroma but it's subtle to the point of very little at all on the nose. It's fine if a touch plain and unexciting, a mild bitterness runs through but it's a little thin and doesn't really do much for me. That said it's fine enough and a happy glugger if drinking and not rating. A5 A4 T6 P3 Ov12. 3.0

White Oak Black Cider;Newberg, Oregon, United States;Apple Cider;White Oak Cider;This was unfortunately another one of those ciders which tasted more like a white wine than a cider. Not that it was bad by any means, but not what I was expecting. It had a soft amber color with a minimum amount of fizz. Its nose was very much like a white wine, as well as was its aftertaste. Very dry.

You know a great beer at the first sip, but you should really finish it to make sure. This beer falls into that category. Piney and sweet hops encompass malts for nose. Full and rich body that is sturdy and robust. Balanced malts and hops...which says a lot since this has a heap of both. A tasty beer with crab cakes.

Overall, not pleasant at all, but yet another Bolivian beer to sample. This is the first time I saw this beer, on the last day of the trip. I sampled this 250 cm3 bottle purchased at a Supermercado on Monsenor Rivero (road) in Santa Cruz, Bolivia on 17 August 2006."
Ducal;Santa Cruz, Bolivia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;CervecerÃ­a Santa Cruz (Bolivia);Weak straw colour. Weak maltish aroma. The flavou is quite weak but the maltiness is there. Average aftertaste with a touch of bitterness. Ducal Pilsener is the local beer of Santa Cruz and has more than 30% of the beer market in the Santa Cruz region.
Ducal;Santa Cruz, Bolivia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;CervecerÃ­a Santa Cruz (Bolivia);Santa Cruzâ€™s beer, and the last new beer for me to try in Bolivia. Pours like ginger ale, yellow with tons of bubbles, rising, and stuck on glass. Head is big, uneven, and foamy white. Aroma is big, strong for 5%, packing lots of malt, corn and rice. Taste actually begins remniscent of ginger ale, sweet, then some apple and banana malts, along with tons of burpy carbonation (read soda water), white grapes, and sweetness rounding out the unexciting palate. Tropically distinguishable from the rest of Bolivian beers, but not great by any means. Think of a malted ginger ale with a little alcohol. Sampled from a 8oz small bottle purchased from a grocery in steamy, palm covered, Santa Cruz.
Ducal;Santa Cruz, Bolivia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;CervecerÃ­a Santa Cruz (Bolivia);"""Twist off"" top. Pale yellow colour with an ""unclean"" appearance. Unpleasant hay-like aroma, bland flavour, and a weakly bitter finish. Certainly not my favourite Bolivian beer (yes, I have tried others!). Local price: 4,20."
Ducal;Santa Cruz, Bolivia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;CervecerÃ­a Santa Cruz (Bolivia);Passable, reasonably dry and clean, you can''t really taste the adjuncts, but then again, you can''t taste much at all.
Andorfer Weizen;Passau-Ries, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Andorfer Weizenbierbrauerei;"Ein tolles WeiÃŸbier. Bei uns in der Gegend (zu Recht) eine Institution und eine Legende. Typischer, ganz eigener, krÃ¤ftig hefig und getreidiger Geschmack. Recht weich. Sehr viel Hefe die durchs Glas wabbert. Toll anzusehen. Herausragend aus der Masse. Not everybodys darling. Irgendwie schmeckt man sofort, dass das aus ner kleinen Klitsche kommt und nicht in einer GroÃŸbrauerei fÃ¼r den Massengeschmack ""entwickelt"" wurde. Nachtrag: Ende 2015 wurde ein GroÃŸteil der Produktion an die Passauer LÃ¶wenbrauerei ausgelagert. Hat sich das Bier dadurch verÃ¤ndert (immerhin haben der Andorfer und LÃ¶wenbrauerei Braumeister den Brauprozess/Rezeptur extra auf die neue Brauanlage zugeschnitten)? NatÃ¼rlich ja. Aber nicht negativ. Ich finde es ist noch etwas weicher, vielschichtiger und ausgewogener geworden. Das getreidige ist leicht reduziert, dafÃ¼r sind mehr blumige Noten dazugekommen. Auch die Farbe kommt mir minimal dunkler vor. Super. Andorfer war frÃ¼her ein Weltklasse-WeiÃŸbier, ist es heute immer noch und hat sich sogar noch mal leicht gesteigert."

Cloudy. Dense long lasting medium sized white head. Medium bodied palate with lot of carbonation. Some butter and cowhouse in nose. Sourness, banana, bitterness, butter and fruitiness in taste.

Franklins Franklinstein Barley Wine;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Pours murky orange with a thin white head and some sediment that quickly settles.

Franklins Franklinstein Barley Wine;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;On tap at the brewpub on 12/6/07: Transparent dark copper amber pour has a nicely-lacing frothy light tan head. Aroma of lightly sweet caramel malt with some fresh grapefruity and orange hoppy notes. Body starts pretty viscous with sweet caramely character and some astringent bitterness toward a slightly earthy, bittersweet finish. I noticed the same strange bitter off-flavor in their coffee stout.
Franklins Franklinstein Barley Wine;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Unfiltered and hazy dark amber and copper colored body with a frothy, thick head. Very strange nose of faint wet cardboard (again), some mineral and vegetable notes, but altogether it doesnâ€™t smell very strong at all, itâ€™s a very mild, almost nonexistent smell. The flavor consists of some light cherry and crystal malt qualities, and it sits thick and vinuous on the palate, but itâ€™s under-carbonated and without any dominant malt body to play on, the most striking feature is the wet cardboard that Franklinâ€™s seems to have in a lot of their beer. In the finish I get a turnip note, which I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever tasted in beer before.
Franklins Franklinstein Barley Wine;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Tasted at brewery. Hazy orange with a white head. Sweet caramel malty aroma and taste with a good hoppy profile.
Franklins Franklinstein Barley Wine;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Draught. Murky brown, small lacy head. Aroma is very hoppy, citrusy, and malty. Flavor is similar, nice bitter finish, alcohol in aftertaste. More like an imperial IPA than barleywine.
Franklins Franklinstein Barley Wine;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Pours a murky amber orange with a wisp of an off white head. Fruity aroma with some caramelized sugar in the background. Nice full mouthfeel and medium soft carbonation. Flavor has a nice amout of fruity hops balanced by some toffee and caramel. Nice bitter finish. Based on previous beers tonight, Its obvious that this brewer like hops. Nothing overly complex, but solid and enjoyable.
Franklins Franklinstein Barley Wine;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Cloudy opaque amber body with a small, off-white head. The aroma is grapefruit, tangereine, fairly hoppy for barley wine with some caramel and toffee. The flavor is caramel, herbal, citrus and moderately sweet. Medium/full body with a sticky texture and soft carbonation.
Franklins Franklinstein Barley Wine;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;I love Franklins but this was a failure. No head, transparent brown. Almost no aroma but I guess if you search you can smell some malt. Flavor was apple at first but finishes with a toxic, industrial taste. I admire a craft brewer for trying it, but Iâ€™d tinker with the recipe next time.
Franklins Franklinstein Barley Wine;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;"Draft, at Franklins; listed as 9.5%. Cloudy, dark reddish-orange appearance; off-white head with good retention and lacing. Plenty of maply syrup and floral / citrus hops in the aroma; oddly, Iâ€™m getting hints of plastic and a slightly lactic quality. Medium-to-full, balanced mouthfeel: plenty of sugar and maple syrup maltiness backing things up, with generous amounts of chewy, citrus hops upfront; good levels of carbonation, very tasty young, though this would age well. Slightly bitter finish, showing citrus and floral hops."
Franklins Franklinstein Barley Wine;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;On tap. Served in a snifter glass. A hazy brownish-red pour with a thick khaki head that lingers. Not a whole lot going on aroma-wise. Fairly sweet and malty aroma with some pears in there. Medium-bodied. A very balanced taste. An ample amount of sweet caramel and malts with a dry, bitter grapefruit finish. The alcohol is slightly noticeable, but I definitely didnâ€™t think this was near 10%. Pretty good.
Franklins Flagship ESB;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Pours a dark cloudy amber. Gentle aroma of citrus hops.

Franklins Flagship ESB;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;On nitro: Pours a hazy dark copper amber with a well-lacing frothy off-white head. Aroma of sweet toasty caramel malt and fresh resiny piny hops. Starts with good fullness and rich malty sweetness balanced with a pretty assertive grapefruity hoppiness for the style before a crisp bittersweet finish. A nice and very drinkable ESB.
Franklins Flagship ESB;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Cask and force-carbonated tap at the brewpub. Red-brown colored. Light malt and english hops in the aroma, with a powerful honey sweetness in the cask version. The flavor is clean and relatively dry caramel malt with a firm hoppy bitterness. The cask version has a sweet honey component adding to this, along with a more grassy aromatic hop character. medium bodied, with lower carbonation in the cask, but not too low. I preferred the regular version and will score according to that, as the cask had too much residual honey for my taste, though some might like the component that it adds.
Franklins Flagship ESB;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Nitro pour at the brew pub. Came to the table a hazy, slightly translucent, orangey brown with zero head. Malty aroma, crackers and biscuit with some slight citrus hops lurking. Flavor was well balanced, sweet malts, sort of that chewy, bready, grainy flavor profile with citrus hops, oranges and lemons, coming in on the end. Crisp finish with some lasting bitterness. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Earlier Rating: 10/28/2006 Total Score: 3.7 This beer looks phenomenal. Murky brown with an orange tint to it with a off white frothy, creamy head. Malty aroma with a hint of hops. Malty flavor, only slightly roasted but bitter at the start and finish. Full bodied and sweet as well. I really liked this.

Hazy, leathery light-brown pour with a very small light-tan head that leaves webs of lace. Aroma is quite faintly of nuts, sweet malts and some hops. Medium-bodied. BIG tastes to this one. Some chocolate, nuts and caramel are present along with more hops than usual for this style. The tongue-stripping, hoppy finish is quite bitter and lingers forever. A unique and extremely flavorful ESB.
Franklins Flagship ESB;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;"Hazy crimson amberish, thin fizzy white head. Nose held notes of citrus, caramel, and hints of toffee. It certainly was well balanced with citrus hops up front and sweetened caramel malt lying just below the surface. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, drying fruity hop finish. Good session beer if 6.5% fits in your definition of ""session beer""..."
Franklins Flagship ESB;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Draft, refreshing aroma lotâ€™s of hops.

NordsjÃ¶ Ã–stgÃ¶ta BlÃ¥bÃ¤rs;Motala, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;NordsjÃ¶ GÃ¥rdsbryggeri;Had this one on bottle many years ago. NordsjÃ¶ was located close to my hometown Motala and I think it was distributed both on Systembolaget and on local pubs. Back then this was a big surprise, I was thrilled to find a beer with blueberries. As I recall it, I found it nice by then, but not really what I was used to. I used to drink macro lagers and had a favorite in John L:s GuldÃ¶l. Things do change...
NordsjÃ¶ Ã–stgÃ¶ta BlÃ¥bÃ¤rs;Motala, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;NordsjÃ¶ GÃ¥rdsbryggeri;Bottled, backlog from around 2000. The brewery was first located in GÃ¶tarsvik, before relocating to NordsjÃ¶. A blue-red coloured (what else?) blueberry lager with blueish head that I found quite interresting since this is, to the best of my knowledge, the first fruit- or berry flavoured commercial beer in Sweden. The blueberry taste is accompanied by a well brewed lager, but after a while it gets overwhelmingly sweet. I think itâ€™s a mistake to sell it only in 500ml bottles. Behind the massive blueberry taste there is just a hint of bitterness.

Grainstore Nip (Winter Nip);Oakham, Rutland, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grainstore Brewery (Rutland Brewing Co.);On tap at the Derby Beer Festival After finding a quiet table I grabbed a half pint of this to cross off a new county. It was good enough that I seriously would have considered going back for more if there werenâ€™t 25 or so other samples to try in the two days I was visiting. I would certainly pick up bottles of this if it was on a local shelf. Aroma / Appearance - The ruby red base retained a thin white head and mild booziness. Raisins, figs, and Welchâ€™s grape juice sweetened the air along with a handful of dried cherry pits. The total package hung in the air like a fog. Flavor / Palate - Raisins and chewy fig newtons coated the mouth in a sweetness. The boozy aspect appeared next followed by caramel and the remains of whatever hops survived. With a sherry like texture this definitely feels like a dessert beer. Among the higher gravity selections it might be one of the best that was available over the weekend.

Michigan Brewing Russian Imperial Stout;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Michigan Brewing Company;2007 Vintage 12oz bottle (no label) purchased in winter of 2007 / 2008 by a trade partner at the original Michigan Brewing location! Pours the deepest mahogany to black, opaque, with a 1 finger medium khaki crown that shows moderate retention and lace.

Robe blonde pÃ¢le et trouble, peu de mousse et effervescence moyenne. TrÃ¨s mince en bouche, les saveurs sont plus discrÃ¨tes que le nez. On retrouve une touche de blÃ© et un petit cÃ´tÃ© Ã©picÃ©. Finale trÃ¨s douce et un peu aqueuse. Rien dâ€™offensant, mais il existe de bien meilleure blanches.
La Voie MaltÃ©e Muse;Chicoutimi, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Voie MaltÃ©e - Microbrasserie du Saguenay;"Sampled at the brewpub over the X-mas holidays. Murky Wit-like ""white"" that was borderline peachy, with a thin, pearly white head. Interesting combination of acidic and spicy nose, sort of like a bastard baby with a Saison father and Gueuze mother. And I donâ€™t think itâ€™s infected, but not entirely sure if this is exactly what the brewer was shooting for. Plenty of yeast, hay and coriander too. Tart and dry, and really refreshing (not very a propos for the cold December evening!), the crans shine through in the sharp aftertaste. Pretty lively effervescence, that tartness in the end makes it dance on that thin line between funky good and funky infected, but it was pretty much thumbs up for me."
La Voie MaltÃ©e Muse;Chicoutimi, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Voie MaltÃ©e - Microbrasserie du Saguenay;"Any first impressions? -Ample foam crowns the cloudy pale yellow. -A tantalizing spicy yeast character benefits from some crisp straw, wooden wilderness and subtle herbs. I am reminded of a Jolly Pumpkin witbier! -White grapes, sturdy haystacks, wild yet mellow spiciness all coalesce into this intelligent, well-calculated tartness; this time Iâ€™m reminded of a Russian River delicacy! -The lively effervescence enlivens the vinous, juicy body. What if you dig deeper? -A piney perfume is hiding amidst the aromaâ€™s milky coriander. -Flour is also present in the storytelling nose. -The perfectly-positioned yeasty wilderness is breathtaking in its humility. -Grassy hops dwell in the haystack. -With intricately-linked flavors, this easily approachable yet immensely complex witbier experience was a fine example of this brewerâ€™s talent. -Once again, from reading other ratings, Voie MaltÃ©e beers seem to evolve and shift quite drastically from batch to batch. When they are in fine form, such as my growler of Muse or the snifter of Criminelle I had at the brewpub, they can be mindblowing experiences. From the growler, opened a day after purchase."
La Voie MaltÃ©e Muse;Chicoutimi, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Voie MaltÃ©e - Microbrasserie du Saguenay;Cloudy light yellow. Small white head. It seemed to me like a base beer to which one or 2 ingredients were forgotten. Overwhelming wheat in the nose, a bit lemony with slight honey suggestions on the palate and mostly coriander as far as spices go. Quite yeasty too, bananaish and grainy at that. Crisp mouthfeel, maybe a bit too carbonated for my liking. Just somehow seems incomplete.. This is the only beer I wonâ€™t remember from La Voie MaltÃ©e...
La Voie MaltÃ©e Muse;Chicoutimi, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Voie MaltÃ©e - Microbrasserie du Saguenay;Spicey aroma, cloudy white, nice foamy head.

Binding Carolus Der Starke Doppelbock;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Binding-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);"330 ml bottle bought at Great Food Hall in Pacific Place, Admiralty. Looks: Clear copper brown colour; Three-finger head with crumpety light beige foam which lasts for 4 minutes; Very good sticky lacing with quite fizzy carbonation. Aroma: Fragrant full amber malt, with good roastyness, nuts, strong caramel, toffee, strong toast, light dark fruits, light alcohol, Cola, molasses, earth, dark bread, light herbs and thin grass. Taste: Mid to strong sweet full amber malt, with caramel, toffee, strong Cola, black coffee, strong dark chocolates, floral, molasses, herbs, strong dark bread, yeast, lemon, mid to strong bitter hops and grass. Body: Mid to light body. Dry, thin and fairly slick palate. Mouth Feel: Full amber maltyness in a somewhat thinned backed. Very dry dark bread all the way. Caramel and light toffee but no fruityness. Pretty toasty with strong dark chocolate bitterness with some black coffee. Medium sweetness crashed with strong bitter herbal hops. Lemon to round. Too single-mindedâ€¦ Hoppiness: Earth, light herbs and thin grass in nose. Floral, herbs, lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness - toast malt and hop extract - is sharp and strong for a lasting, high astringent sweet-bitter malty finish. After Taste: Very dry. Toasty malty and strong bitter to mouth. Comments: This one is like a very pumped-up Dunkel, and more like the liquid bread for the fasting monks described in history books: dry-ish malt and Cola backbone backed by strong toast and strong (but not pleasant) herbal hoppiness. Looks good but tastes one-dimensional. Drinkable but not top."

Ceres Top Classic;Ã…rhus, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ceres Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);"I rate this beer mostly for ""historic"" reasons. Like in the 90â€™s when people would ask me to say wether I preferred Blur or Oasis I would answer Pulp, in the 80â€™s in Denmark the kids would ask me if I was a Carlsberg or Tuborg drinker, I would answer, Ceres Top. The old 3rd way is big with me, which means Iâ€™d probably waste my vote if I was ever taking part in an election in the US. The beer is very typical industry fare, but tasting it again for the first time in years (it is now near impossible to find outside Aarhus, or in North Jutland anyhow) I found that it is quite refreshing, doesâ€™t have the rotten fruit flavor of Carlsberg, and tastes less than moved grass than Tuborg. So, all in all, somewhat better than others of its kind, or not."

Buller India Pale Ale;TristÃ¡n SuÃ¡rez, Ezeiza, Greater Buenos Aires, Argentina;IPA;Buller Brewing Company;Tap at brewpub. Deep amber color, medium-sized off-white head. Aroma is resiny with some overriped fruits. Medium-bodied. Flavor is too resiny and riped fruity. Gives a bit unfresh feeling.
Buller India Pale Ale;TristÃ¡n SuÃ¡rez, Ezeiza, Greater Buenos Aires, Argentina;IPA;Buller Brewing Company;Hops makes its presence felt but doesnâ€™t fill up the room. Can at least detect it firhg from the first smell. It doesnâ€™t feel like enough hops to preserve a beer from London to Bombay, however.
Buller India Pale Ale;TristÃ¡n SuÃ¡rez, Ezeiza, Greater Buenos Aires, Argentina;IPA;Buller Brewing Company;Drank last year, while I was in Buenos Aires. Maybe my favorite beer from my expedition in Argentina. Hops is something South Americans brewers seems afraid of, maybe because of frightened customers and consumers, maybe because hops are expensive there, I simply donâ€™t know. Well, for the South American standards, I thought that hops (citric hops nonetheless!) had a nice presence in this beer, with a pleasant malt presence. But the feel of the beer was kind of watery, which was a disappointment. Color is amber/orange. More of a Bitter (if not Mild Ale) than an India Pale Ale. Very sessionable though (on cask, this would have been a blow me think). Honest and pleasant. Neostoicism was a syncretic philosophical movement, joining Stoicism and Christianity.

Steelhead Heat Miser;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Steelhead Brewing Co.;This stuff is killer. That is all I can say. A very nice strong ale, that is immediately there in your mouth, right off the bat, you know what you are drinking.

Steelhead Peregrine Tooks IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;This was alright, I was expecting more. This had a little bit more of a grassy herbal note and had a bit of a sopay fizzy and watered down malt character.
Steelhead Peregrine Tooks IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Cloudy orange and gold appearance. Texture is creamy and more full than the bombay bomber IPA - some soap, sugar and marijuana notes, creamy throughout. Slightly fizzy and light to medium bodied.
Steelhead Peregrine Tooks IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;(Draft: 2005 Oregon Brewers Festival in Portland, OR) Smells very hoppy, very fresh, and sweet. But well, itâ€™s not all that sweet, but the hops in the nose definitely dominates the flavor. Itâ€™s quite bitter and grapefruity actually, with a mildly sweet English maltiness providing a nice backbone. Medium body with a crisp finish. Very cloudy and amber in color. The off-white head isnâ€™t large or long-lasting, but is very easy to revive with a quick swirl. One of the better beers Iâ€™ve had at this festival.

Steelhead Anniversary Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Steelhead Brewing Co.;A deep dark reddish to mahoganny ale with a thin lacing creamy moka head.

On tap at brewpub, Jan. 17 2009.
Steelhead Anniversary Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Steelhead Brewing Co.;This was a big rich monster, lots of sweet malts up front, lightly roasted, with a caramel taste that intensifies as it warms on your palate.

Steelhead Anniversary Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Burlingame. Very sweet, alcohol aroma. Nice. Ruby red color with tan head. Head is lasting to some degree with nice lace. Strong alcohol mouthfeel. Some off-notes, but still solid.
Steelhead Anniversary Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Steelhead Brewing Co.;It looks nice with the dark tan color, the name sounds nice, but this beer doesnâ€™t taste that good. It has an alcohol content of 10.5%, and it tastes like it. Itâ€™s almost like drinking a dark ale with a shot of vodka added to it. The booze ruined this beer for me.

Frog Island Natterjack;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Frog Island Brewery;Cask @ Lamb, Stoke Goldington. Golden and clear. Thin white head on top. Unconvincing aroma of banana, thin malt and sour fruit. Taste is very well balanced, a bittersweet taste leading to bitter-sour finish. Lingering aftertaste. Goes well with my meal but not so muchÂ on its own. Pretty good for this type of beer.
Frog Island Natterjack;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Frog Island Brewery;Cask (Charters, Peterborough) Simple barley aroma. Pale orange, tiny brief head. Slightly leguminous, but not full-on vegetal. Cornflakes? Some toffee. A touch sour later. Has those soapy bitter fertilised female hops in the bitterness - quite agressive. The late finish has lots of barley which is an improvemtent. A barely adequate beer. No real flaws, in theory, but misses the mark in several places when it comes to what reached the glass.
Frog Island Fire-Bellied Toad;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Frog Island Brewery;Cask by handpump at Bon Accord, Glasgow - clear deep golden, thin white head, some lacing, no detectable aroma, biscuity, bit of fruit, sweet, easy to drink
Frog Island Fire-Bellied Toad;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Frog Island Brewery;500ml Brown bottle (bottle conditioned), best before 31st Aug 2010, drank and reviewed 23rd July 2010. Poured slowly into a vase shaped â€™Old Speckled Henâ€™ badged glass. The beer produced a magnificent foaming head of snow drift size and colour. Below sat a pale amber, dull orange body. Carbonisation was good, you could see bubbles rising through the slightly hazey brew. The aromas were of yeast and hops, no malt content. Pilot being the only hop used (according to the label), Maris Otter, Crystal and Wheat malts added nothing to the smell. The malts and Pilot hops did blend together well in the taste, sharp, refreshing and with a bitter aftertaste as the mouth dried. The 5.0% ABV is nicely placed within the beer and the balance between all the ingrediants seems to sit well. My first beer from this brewery, I have two more bottles of theirs in my stash and Iâ€™ll also look out for any of their beers in cask form in future.
Frog Island Fire-Bellied Toad;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Frog Island Brewery;Pours a viciously overactive murky goldish brown (the same colour a stewed apricots). Aromas of basement and a little bit of lemon, a little bit of grapefruit. Actually, if sniffed blind, youâ€™d think it was Belgian. The flavour is a little more mild with good malt, carbonation and gentle hopping coming through. When I opened the bottle and had to rush to fill the glass with foam I wasnâ€™t terribly happy, but I put that down to it being a beer that is alive and has had to travel to the other side of the world. I like this. I like that someone in England regards their beer so highly to send it to me in New Zealand. As I mentioned, this beer has a definite Belgian ale character of greenish white wine and yeasty basement and it endures. Calling it a Golden/Blonde Ale does it a massive disservice. Itâ€™s better than that.
Frog Island Fire-Bellied Toad;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Frog Island Brewery;On cask. Pours a dark golden colour with a fair off-white head. Aroma of caramel, barley, yeast and apple. Similar flavours, mild carbonation and a dirty tar-like finish. Not the best.

Fat and balanced like Beowulf; robust earthy malts, applepeel and orange citrus, pine, gooseberry. Some pineapple emerging as it warms. Impressive from 1 variety of English hop (Pilot). Bracing, hairs-on-your-chest stuff with a dollop of farmyard about it. If it said â€™Belgiumâ€™ and â€™7.5%â€™ on the bottle Octo wouldnâ€™t be whinging and reaching for the Brugs."

A filmy layer on top of a next to clear golden-brown body. Modest malt accented aromas with hints of fruity hops. Malt-fruity flavours, marmalade impression. Resinous bitterness to the ending.

Frog Island Shoemaker;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Frog Island Brewery;"A beautiful sunny afternoon on Friday 7th September 2012 saw my father and I join in R.A.T.2012 (Rail Ale Trail part 2). Split between three bars along the Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury railway line: they had over 50 different beers to try: this was one of them. Half-pint, gravity fed in the fest tent behind Codsall Railway Station. Really liked this: good light amber body; with a good head of off-white foam sat on top. Mixed bag of aromas, floral, semi-sweet molasses and woodyards. The taste was on the maltier side than hoppy although a hop bitterness was never far away. Well balanced and easy to drink, ideal on the day I reviewed it."

Some citric, slightly resinous hop accents (I now see it uses Cascade) in the flavour. The hops are less prominent in the aroma. Decent enough. The hops are fine, just used rather too sparingly.

Bavik Pilaarbijter Blond;Harelbeke, Belgium;Tripel;De Brabandere;"Voici une biÃ¨re pas du tout hypocrite, Ã  lâ€™inverse de ce ""Mordeur de colonne"" de Pieter Breughel. Elle assume en effet complÃ¨tement son parti pris pour une biÃ¨re en deux temps, le premier tournÃ© vers des arÃ´mes doux de caramel et de pain avant de voir un alcool sâ€™affirmer peu Ã  peu pour devenir omni-prÃ©sent. Ce parti pris la rend singuliÃ¨re, mais sur le dÃ©sÃ©quilibre de cet alcool intense en bouche, se perd de la richesse aromatique. Lâ€™intÃ©rÃªt pour cette biÃ¨re (et le plaisir pris) sâ€™en voit largement amenuisÃ©. En verre, nous avons un beau blond dorÃ©, parfaitement limpide, avec une mousse blanche, aÃ©rÃ©e dâ€™un centimÃ¨tre et demi. Le nez est apprÃ©ciable, lÃ©gÃ¨rement floral avec des accents de miel, de caramel et un soupÃ§on de coriandre. A la dÃ©gustation, lâ€™attaque est souple, sur des arÃ´mes principalement de caramel, de pain et un soupÃ§on dâ€™Ã©pices. La deuxiÃ¨me bouche voit lâ€™alcool sâ€™affirmer. Que ce soit sur la ligne principale, tournÃ©e autour du malt avec des arÃ´mes de caramel et de pain, ou sur lâ€™arriÃ¨re bouche davantage tournÃ©e sur une amertume lÃ©gÃ¨rement Ã©picÃ©e. La corpulence est tout Ã  fait honnÃªte avec une bonne prÃ©sence en bouche. Lâ€™alcool sâ€™intensifie alors de faÃ§on crescendo pour un final, dâ€™une longueur correcte sur un duo alcool et notes poivrÃ©es oÃ¹ lâ€™amertume Ã  du mal Ã  marquer sa prÃ©sence. Lâ€™alcool titrant Ã  8,5 % Abv est alors trÃ¨s prÃ©sent et tire sur le liquoreux avec un sucre fortement dosÃ© (sans lâ€™Ãªtre de trop toutefois). BiÃ¨re affirmÃ©e donc, respectable mÃªme, mais sans sÃ©duire rÃ©ellement avec un manque de complexitÃ© et une homogÃ©nÃ©itÃ© perfectible."

Sweet malts, caramel, chestnut, rye bread with honey, some dusty cardboard. Moderate sweet and bitter. Medium body and soft carbonation. Juicy mouth, tasty drink.
HofmÃ¼hl Dunkel;EichstÃ¤tt, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Privatbrauerei HofmÃ¼hl;Cracking beer. I love my dunkels, but this one is slightly different, to its credit. The burnt umber pour gives off a distinct smell of brewyard malts--the smell you get as you walk past a brewery. There's even a farmyard niff, as if cows have been nestling on the malt. So this is proper rustic. The mouthfeel is thicker, more viscous than in the more sophisticated Bavarian dunkels--it's very smooth. The taste is unpretentious--the malts taste of malt, not chocolate, burnt toast, coffee, dark fruits and all that old cobblers--it tastes of roasted malts. My favourite taste. Above that, there's a slightly smoky tone, which is very welcome. I can't taste any hops bitterness ... but there's a metallic note on the end, which reminds me this is a lager and not nectar from the gods. Proper drink, though. HofmÃ¼hl: I shall remember the name.
HofmÃ¼hl Dunkel;EichstÃ¤tt, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / TmavÃ½;Privatbrauerei HofmÃ¼hl;"Well balanced texture, creamy and thick without being too much of either; medium body and the ideal level of sweetness for my palate. Hints of coffee and bread and my only real criticism is that I wished those tastes came through a bit stronger. Big fan of this however and I'll be looking to get more in when possible."

Smells of aroma, but not much else. Taste is a whole mixed bag of things - ranging from a sweet light maltiness, to nothing at all, to cooking apples, to nothing at all, to beer. No, sorry I was lying about that last one. A masterpiece of blandness, but at least it wasnâ€™t nasty. If Iâ€™m being fair, I will own up to a little hint of hop in it.

Copper Tank Wabash Cannon Bock;Austin, Texas, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;"Yeah, so I go to C-Tank looking for some new brews to try, and their head brewer comes out and offers me some of this, their newest beer. He was a pretty cool guy, I think he had been enjoying his new creation :) Anyway I told him about ratebeer, so hopefully he visits the site. 'twas an excellent beer; the yeasty banana-clove flavor went quite well with the vanilla tones that were prominent in the flavor and aroma. Very clean finish with the vanilla coming through and lingering on the palate for a few minutes. The ABV was quite well disguised; I'd have never guessed 8.2%.

Night of the Living Ales II at Goose Island Wrigleyville, Chicago, IL 03/04/2006
Mickey Finns Little Fort Porter;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Porter;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Nitro head holds lasting and creamy over a deep black body with garnet highlights. Coffee roasts and dark chocolate aroma with occasional smokiness. Palate is rather watery, but it doesnâ€™t affect the flavor of smoky chocolate roasts with a gentle, sugar-sweet finish. I decided to have an additional pint to enjoy rather than deconstruct. A really good brew, regardless if youâ€™re a fan of nitrogenation or not. On tap at Mickey Finnâ€™s , Libertyville, IL 60048
Mickey Finns Little Fort Porter;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Porter;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;(01.16.06) Cask conditioned version available at Mickey Finnâ€™s, Libertyville, IL. Brown black porter with large long-lasting head with good lacing. No discernable carbonation. Faint malt aroma. Medium-bodied with creamy texture that starts with light malt sweetness and chocolate flavor. Finishes dry with light lingering bitterness. Smooth, creamy, like liquid chocolate. Delicious.
Mickey Finns Little Fort Porter;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Porter;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Smells burnt, and of roasted malt. Descent taste but is watery. Can pick out the elements of roasted malt and dark chocolate. Nor as full and robust as Iâ€™d like but a welcomed change to the other soft beers I sampled at Mickey Finnâ€™s that same day.
Mickey Finns R.K.s IPA;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;IPA;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;"From notes. First reviewed 7/6/2010. On tap at Mickey Finnâ€™s in a pint glass. The beer has a slightly hazy dark golden / copper color with just barely a ring of a head. No lacing, very little visible carbonation. The aroma is hops - they describe the smell in the menu as hoppy and I cannot do better. After my first whiff, I am hoping the flavor does not mimic this flat, one dimensional smell. Unfortunately, it does. The flavor is listed as ""very hoppy (citrus),"" and I agree, except for the citrus part. Barely any flavor is able to sneak through this palette-destroying hop nuke. It is painfully obvious from the first sip forward that they just throw a ton of bittering hops in, forgetting that adding hops later in the process will add ""flavor"" and ""aroma."" After half a glass, the taste is pungent and cloying. Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, medium body. Some graininess and a fair amount of hop oil. I would never order this again. It is definitely the worst IPA I have ever had. A stark comparison to their Hefe, which I enjoyed. Almost curious enough to try to get the recipe from the brewmaster just to post it as a warning."
Mickey Finns R.K.s IPA;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;IPA;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Sampled at AleFest Chicago. Poured a fairly clear orange/amber with an average, off white foam and clingy lacing. The aroma was floral, with citrus and some resin following up. The flavor added to these some caramel and a balancing, appropriate hop bitterness. A refreshing, basic IPA.
Mickey Finns R.K.s IPA;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;IPA;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Cask @ Day of the Living Ales. Pours copper with a thin white head. I had this one right after Lunar Brewingâ€™s Moondance IPA and this one wasnâ€™t as good. Still decent aroma of citrus hops. Bitter finish. Decent IPA.
Mickey Finns R.K.s IPA;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;IPA;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;clear gold, light off white head, no lace of which to speak. aroma is mild grapefruit, hints of pine. more flavorful than the nose suggests, with grapefruit, pine and a hint of pepper, nicely balanced. perhaps a suggestion of creamy caramel. medium bodied, bitter pine finish. quite enjoyably bitter. sampled at day of the living ales, 2009.
Mickey Finns R.K.s IPA;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;IPA;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Clear amber with a tight head. Nice piney and floral hop aroma. Medium body. Mild flavor is sweet piney hop juice riding a bready malt base. Nicely bitter to finish.
Mickey Finns R.K.s IPA;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;IPA;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;"Draught sampler: Clingy head over an enticing copper IPA body. Smell shows a nice bit of hop to it. Taste shows it is not a hop bomb, but itâ€™s very nicely laid out; lemon and pine with some English hops in balance (thatâ€™s what I thought before I saw the description, so Iâ€™m actually improving my palate!). A nice combination of US and UK style. Nitro sampler: Toward the end of my sampler tour, this still shows a star-shaped bit of foam in my glass. Carbonation is a little firm for a nitro, but pinprickly and enjoyable. Nitro gives the caramel malt more room to play"
Mickey Finns R.K.s IPA;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;IPA;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;On nitro. Poured a clear medium caramel with a short cap of creamy off-white headâ€¦ creamy lacing followed it down. The aroma was muted by the nitro treatment.. but pine, floral, and some sweet caramel seep through.. picks up steam as it warms. The flavor was really carried by sticky vegetal and pine notes.. did not enjoy that very much.. caramel base.. left rather sharp pine and vegetal notes on a long-ish finish. Slick beginning becomes tacky and ugly feeling the rest of the way across the palate. Not good.
Mickey Finns R.K.s IPA;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;IPA;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;(03.18.06) On tap at Mickey Finnâ€™s, Libertyville, IL. Clear amber hued IPA with a tiny white head. No discernable carbonation. Light hop aroma. Medium bodied that starts with light malt sweetness and light hop flavor. Slight hop bitterness in the mouth. Finishes dry with light hop bitterness. The hop flavor component was underwhelming. This beer is styled closer to a pale ale, than a IPA. Though this is a good drinkable beer, hopheads will be disappointed.
Mickey Finns R.K.s IPA;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;IPA;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Decent enough APA but too tame to be considered an IPA I think! Some pine and grapefruit hopping over the caramel malt base. I picked up a faint trace of solvent, that thankfully was very transitory. Iâ€™d drink this again, but not if I was in the mood for a real IPA.
Mickey Finns R.K.s IPA;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;IPA;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Sampled at Night of the Living Ales II. A translucent orange with white frothy head. Pine and floral hops along with citrus and caramel malts. A standard but decent IPA.

Firehouse Wilderness Wheat;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Wheat Ale;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Pour on tap at the brewery, slightly hazy orange yellow pour with thin white head, aroma brought notes of bread, dough, some grain, husk, slight earth, some yeast. Taste was a mix of earth, bread, dough, some yeast into a bit of grain, very slight fruit into some trash, finishing slightly spicy.
Firehouse Wilderness Wheat;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Wheat Ale;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Kind of a boring wheat beer. Not a ton of flavor or body. Lacked complexity in my opinion.
Firehouse Wilderness Wheat;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Wheat Ale;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);On draft at the brewery. The beer has a light copper body with a mid haze and small, off-white head. The aroma is weak, but offers a little wheat, cracker, lemon. Refreshing, but bland. Thin, watery body with only hints of wheat, light spice, biscuity malt. No off flavors, just lacking and unassertive. At >4% abv, this goes down easily on a summer day.

Firehouse Buffalo Bitter;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);"Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy orange to light brown color. Bar pour doesnâ€™t yield any head. The smell had the normal ""soapiness"" of English malts extending throughout the beer. Light somewhat spicy hops are underneath. The taste followed the nose. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionable aspect about it. Overall, I say this was a good ESB worthy of having again."
Firehouse Buffalo Bitter;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);On draft at the brewery.

Firehouse Buffalo Bitter;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Draft at brewpub - a fairly lackluster, overly sweet bitter - a lot of residual sugar and adjunct-y (corn syrup-like) sweetness - some toasted/burnt grains and faint earthy hops - not so much bitter at the end as it is acidic - a little metallic on the tail end - boring.

Firehouse India Pale Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;IPA;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Another beer I don't remember too much about other than it was very good. My wife and I were passing through and tried this brew pub and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

Firehouse India Pale Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;IPA;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Draft at the brewery. Scores low because I do not think this is an ipa at all.
Firehouse India Pale Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;IPA;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Sweet and fruity aroma, some apple and brown sugar present, along with hints of cola and black cherry, perhaps a very slight amount of bubblegum and lurking far in the background are some leafy hops. Incredibly deep, dark red color, unusual shade for an IPA, with a very slight head, dissipating completely over a short while. Flavor profile is balanced a bit toward the hops, luckily, acting to keep it somewhat in style, also has some brown sugary malts up front, turning fruity and blended with some notable yeast esters midpoint, mingling with the spicy, lightly piney hop notes and yielding a light-moderate amount of bitterness there at the finish and a barely noticeable amount of alcohol. Some Kool-Aid and cotton candyish notes very late. Really more like a Brown/Amber hybrid with a higher degree of hopping than usual. Smooth carbonation prickly mouthfeel regardless, also lightly syrupy and with a medium body. Somewhat interesting but not quite brewed to style, for those expecting a standard IPA.
Firehouse India Pale Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;IPA;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Draft at the brewery. Not exactly a standard IPA, copper colored light tan head. Citurs and caramel aroma, mild all around. The flavor is a good bit malty though there is plenty of citrus and bitterness from the hops. Medium bodied with a bite of bitterness that lingers. A tad bit slimy with a lingering finish.
Firehouse India Pale Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;IPA;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);On tap at brewpub. Ugh. Ruddy red color with no head. No hop aroma at all. Slight caramel malts aroma and taste some sweetness. Very mild dry finish. I think they missed a brewing step with the hops or were a little short as this was not good at all.
Firehouse India Pale Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;IPA;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);From Bottle. Great nose, tons of hops, flowers, fruit. Nice bite to the nose. Pours a very nice clystal amber, nice fluffy white head that has good staying power. Attack doesnâ€™t quite live up to the nose, which is too bad because the attack comes off weaker than it is just because the nose is so strong. Nice bitterness to this beer. Finishes very well.
Firehouse India Pale Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;IPA;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);This is a decent IPA that smelled really good with lots of aroma. The attack was ok with plenty of hops, but it was just decent after that. A sold IPA, but nothing special
Firehouse India Pale Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;IPA;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Has a nice amber color and a fruity hop smell. Taste is nicely hopped and finishes with a nice bitterness. Overall this a good IPA, but I prefer the bitter for a good hop beer.
Firehouse Chukkar Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Pale Ale - English;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);On tap in a flight at the brewery. Nice, brownish, orange color, with some fine, beige remnants of a head. Pine, butterscotch, and some hay and earth. Sweet and malty, with a sharp, nice bitterness.

Firehouse Chukkar Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Pale Ale - English;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);An OK pale ale. Well balanced between the hops and malts but lacks body and complexity. Only ok.
Firehouse Chukkar Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Pale Ale - English;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy light brown with some light orange tinges around the sides of the glass. A soft thin white head died within less than a minute. Mild stringy lacing slid into the body. The smell seemed to have had English malts up front with a light bitter grassy hoppiness running underneath. The taste was basically the same. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a fairly decent sessionable aspect about it. Overall, I say this was a decent English Pale ale to have again.

Firehouse Chukkar Ale;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Pale Ale - English;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);On drat at the pub. Yet another diacetyl bomb like the other five I have tried so far. Spicy hops and grain malts accompany the diacetyl. Meh.
Firehouse Brown-Eyed Girl;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Brown Ale;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Though retired, I had this well before it was. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a dark brown color. Bar pour didnâ€™t have any head. The smell had a light nuttiness with a roasty malt. There was some light chocolate in there as well. The taste followed the nose. On the palate, this one sat light for a brown ale, perhaps a little more watery than expected. Pretty sessionable. Overall, no complaints from me, could probably have downed a fair amount of these in a session.
Firehouse Brown-Eyed Girl;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Brown Ale;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);On draft at the brewery. The beer has a dark chestnut body with a small beige ringlet atop.

Firehouse Strong Arm Porter;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Porter;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Fairly mild aroma, some dark toffee and cocoa, some slight roastiness present here as well. Opaque ebony color, head is almost fully diminishing. Flavor is bittersweet and chocolately to start, but mildly, becoming a bit more roasty and features some mild bitterness towards the finish, both from the lightly spicy hop character and the mildly coffeeish malts, seemingly. Lingering notes of cocoa at the very end. Smooth, thin mouthfeel, low in effervescence, body is light-medium. Less interesting than many Porters Iâ€™ve tried.
Firehouse Strong Arm Porter;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Porter;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Draft at brewpub. Dark brown color with an average creamy brown head that mostly lasted and produced good lacing. Moderate roasted chocolate aroma. Medium body with a dry smooth texture.

Firehouse Strong Arm Porter;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Porter;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);This is beer is a strong porter. I thought this was the worst beer at the firehouse. I agree with mr. od40oz about the higher temp. It would taste a lot better cold.
Firehouse Strong Arm Porter;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Porter;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Dark beer with a smooth taste and no head. Had an unusual aftertaste.

Flatlanders Lincolnshire Lager;Lincolnshire, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Flatlanders Restaurant & Brewery;Enjoyed on tap at Flatlanders Brewery while waiting for some soon-to-be former co-workers (2 weeks left!). Appearance like miller lite, clear pale yellow with small white head. Aroma like miller lite, smells of straw hay, somewhat like an old manâ€™s basement but not as succinct as ml, no hop presence whatsoever. Taste is surprisingly good! Actually has a piney hop flavor that adds to the smoothness, slightly crisp in the flnish, not too malty, actually more hoppy than malty but not an ipa or pale ale by any means. Pleasant surprise and would definitely recommend to any continual lager consumers.
