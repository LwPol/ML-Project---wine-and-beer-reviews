Beamish Irish Stout,"Cork, Ireland",Stout - Dry,Heineken Ireland,Really creamy and thick from pump in Duke of York . Really nice old man once told me doesn't travel well ( like Guinness only evenmore.
Beamish Irish Stout,"Cork, Ireland",Stout - Dry,Heineken Ireland,"50cl can at home (9 II 2019), as Beamish genuine draught Irish stout. Light brownish, coffee cream coloured head - very solid and frothy, and oh so sticky and long lasting - topping a dark, black liquid with keen red glooming dashes. This is a good looking start, for sure. The nose is a bit vague, with distant metallic notes and some caramel and malt features. Maybe some toffee too. The mouthfeel has a great dryness which come with a roasted maltness and slight sweet hints. The bitterness is quite enjoyable. The body is light, coffee-like even, yet there is a creamy touch in there as well - making this an above average/classic, interesting stout. The smooth tongue is even enhanced with a fiarly low carbonation. At the back, one can spot some liquorice or raisins, some dark chocolate maybe. This is a fine, well portrayed stout."

Aroma subtly sweet. Taste slightly of roasted coffee and hints of dark chocolate with a slight coffee bitterness. Medium body. Smooth and creamy with slight coffee bitterness on a moderately long finish. East drinking."
Beamish Irish Stout,"Cork, Ireland",Stout - Dry,Heineken Ireland,"Cans. Brown black pour with nitro foam. Faint aroma. Taste is bitter, very roasty, way more roasty than Guinness and much less on the licorice molasses side. Palate is light bodied and creamy. Decent"
Beamish Irish Stout,"Cork, Ireland",Stout - Dry,Heineken Ireland,"Not great. The trophy wife/husband of the beer world. People will think you're happily drinking a pint of the black stuff, but you'll actually be deeply unsatisfied wishing you had a proper pint. Spend that extra 50c on the real deal."

Abita Amber Lager,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna,Abita Brewing Company,"[12oz bottle from Total Wines, Naples, FL.] A bright copper coloured pour with a loose white head; grassy aroma with some caramel; very thin in the mouth with a burnt caramel taste and little else; and a weak and watery finish. Disappointing."
Abita Amber Lager,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna,Abita Brewing Company,"Draft. Clear amber body, small beige head. The aroma has some iron and malt. The taste is mellow."
Abita Amber Lager,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna,Abita Brewing Company,"Aroma is mild caramel, adjunct and slight honey. Taste is bready, slight caramel and lots of rice and corn adjunct followed by a tad of bland hops."
Abita Amber Lager,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna,Abita Brewing Company,"12 oz. bottle poured to a fest chalice at home showing a clear & bright, amber color, with a presentable layer of tan froth, with foamy dots & dashes of lacing. The nose was toasted, with a touch of caramel sweetness. Medium bodied, with good carbonation, the taste was similar, presenting a bit of malty creaminess, mild spice, and slightly roasted astringency with a touch of lingering earthiness to the finish. Not overly exciting, but food compatible, and decently drinkable."
Abita Amber Lager,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna,Abita Brewing Company,"Poured solid amber, small head. Slight aroma of caramel, fudge, sweet toffee. Bit thinner on taste, malty bitterness, slight citrus notes. Overall not at all bad but not as solid as it could be."
Abita Amber Lager,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna,Abita Brewing Company,12o bottle. Pours a clear. Bright amber with a big tight white head. Scents of malt and some caramel. The malt start is followed fast by a dry almost ashy body with some barnyard in the finish. Really complex and interesting. Sort astringent finish with some sours lingering. A good balanced but complicated amber.
Abita Amber Lager,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna,Abita Brewing Company,"From bottle in shaker at Bourbon St., Southbank. Pours clear amber w/off-white head, modest malt aroma. Caramel sweetness without much bitterness to balance."
Abita Amber Lager,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna,Abita Brewing Company,12oz bottle purchased at Walgreens. Pint glass. Copper light amber color. Quarter finger off white head. Smells slightly metallic. Malty cereal. Taste is very mild sweetness with an odd bitterness and a slightly skunky off flavor. Pretty unpleasant. Only consume in desperate situations.

Abita Andygator,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Bock - Doppelbock,Abita Brewing Company,"Aroma is mineral water, caramel and a mild vegetal note. Taste is light sweet malts, caramel, honey and a mild ry spiciness."
Abita Andygator,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Bock - Doppelbock,Abita Brewing Company,"Golden with a thin, frothy head. Very little aroma—bready, a bit. Taste is blandly sweet, full of dough and grains. Mild, crisp bitterness at the end. Underwhelming. This is misclassified and should be a „Heller Bock“. An attempt at one anyway."
Abita Andygator,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Bock - Doppelbock,Abita Brewing Company,"I am very interested in the genetic heritage of the reviewers who participate in this beers review! I once took a test of my pallet preferences and it directly correlated to my ancestors home country. Seems that people (like myself) from Baltic region, have a different preference for taste! I like this beer very much. My like differs from the average review. I read the package info and it states it is, for the most part, a German Perle Hop, and a German Lager Yeast, beer. carton implies that it pairs with exactly what I was eating when I originally fell in love with this beer, (anything crawfish, and as I can attest ""alligator and shrimp"". carton also goes on to state that it is goes good with Gorgonzola and Blue Cheese dishes. If this sounds like a good beer for your dinning preferences then I suggest you try it! I must admit that when I have the opportunity to have it on draft (when I'm in New Orleans) it is a real treat when I'm eating true Cajun Cooking. If you haven't noticed, I'm not about to give you a description of the beer as others have. My so called pallet is unique to me and I can not begin to describe it in the terms that the other reviewers have described, as I don't imply I have an ability that rivals the gods, but I like it with what I like to eat. Can you sit and drink it like your favorite watered down beer? No! But I think you owe it to the craftmanship of the brewers art, to try this beer when the opportunity arises! I live in Missouri and have to special order this brew from one of the few places that have access to it. I recently purchased three cases and I can honestly say this is a staple in my pantry!"

Abita Andygator,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Bock - Doppelbock,Abita Brewing Company,"I’m not an expert on bocks or doublebocks for that matter. This is the smoothest one I’ve had so far. Great balance of flavors, though I suspect that with a doublebock I should be getting something stronger. For now I’ll say this is my favorite, but who knows what will happen down the road on my doublebock journey. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Abita Andygator,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Bock - Doppelbock,Abita Brewing Company,"(12oz bottle, part of a variety 12-pack) AROMA: very light/soft nose. hint of malt, hay, biscuit, detergent APPEARANCE: slightly brownish straw yellow. creamy yet thin head. hint of haze. TASTE: moderately rich malt, graininess that leans toward corn. some alcohol but not too much, dried and roasted fruit, dark toast, dark green vegetables, grass, bitter mocha/coffee, touch of bran. As noted, not very sweet. PALATE: medium body ... not that heavy. front is smooth and watery, then a bit more richness kicks in with a nice bitter and mostly dry finish. OVERALL: don't drink Doppelbocks very often so can't provide any sort of comparative opinion. This beer is lighter and easier to drink than expected. Looks like a robust lager, but it tastes like a lager blended with a Belgian Strong Ale or Abbey Dubbel. So, still easy to drink but considerably more punch than most every day beers. Nose is pretty weak, appearance is average, but it has some nice Strong Ale/Bock flavors. I wasn't too fond of this on the first couple sips, but I found it to be a respectable (if slightly off-balanced and one dimensional) beer."
Abita Andygator,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Bock - Doppelbock,Abita Brewing Company,"Pours dark chestnut with a tan head. Aroma is nuts, dried fruit and some roast. Taste is raisin and almond, moving to roast and light citrus. Finish is smooth roast."
Abita Andygator,"Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States",Bock - Doppelbock,Abita Brewing Company,From a 12 oz. bottle. Pours a clear gold with a thick off white head. Aroma is bready. The flavor is moderately sweet bread dough and lemon zest.
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;This reminds me more of a Pilsner or ESB vs. Bock. A lighter feel than the average in this style. Weak on the caramel malt. Flavor and feel barely above average. Actually one of the better Abitas that I've sampled, but just not good enough to want again.
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a golden color with a small white head. Has a fruity malty caramel aroma. Fruity malty caramel flavor with hints of dark fruit. Has a fruity malty caramel finish.
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle poured into a brandy snifter. The beer is a clear gold with a white head of foam. Good head retention. Fruity and grainy aroma. The taste is lightly floral and bitter. A little bready. Everything seems muted in the taste. Aroma waa good, but taste just falls short. Medium body and medium carbonation.
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle labeled “Mardi Gras Bock”. AROMA: Slightly sweet with scents of bread dough, malt, and caramel. APPEARANCE: Pours a golden, clear amber with a tall, white head that dissipates slowly. TASTE: Slightly sweet with flavors of bread and caramel. PALATE: Medium-bodied but just a tad on the thin side. Carbonation is average. Finish is dry and has a (very) slight antiseptic taste. OVERALL: Better than your average “grocery store” beer, but by no means is a “great” beer. This is a beer that I would label as “premium pool party beer”. Meaning, people would be very impressed if you served this at your next pool party, but it would not impress your beer aficionados friends.
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;"12 Fl Oz bottle (as Mardi Gras Bock) on 2nd Mar 2019 while staying with my daughter in Orange County, California. Clear and clean amber body, thin and wispy white head. Cinder Toffee aroma, sweet malty molasses in the flavour with caramel notes to the fore. Bought in a Trader Joe's, cooled and drank after a huge Pizza; I am stuffed, but still enjoying this beer as I write this, it's like my dessert I suppose."
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle at the house. Smell sweet and grainy. Light off-white head. Deep golden in color. Taste the grains and has a sweet taste to this beer. Light bodied with sweet after taste. Not what I was expecting, but pretty good. Good for a party beer. Cheers!
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;"Bottle labelled as ""Mardi Gras Bock"". Poured clear amber with a 3-finger off-white head. Mild, grainy aroma. Maybe a touch of caramel. Body is medium-to-full with a mildly dry finish. Stereotypical malty flavor, with nutty and caramel notes."
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;"Draught at Perch Brewery as ""Mardi Gras Bock"", 3/9/18. Clear, goldenrod-to-light-brass. Thin white head showing low retention. Waxy, vague, mineralesque nose does not feel anywhere near as malty as a bock should. Some vanilla, light honey, vague grain and light cereal really go nowhere and there's a touch of corn and alcohol lingering. In the mouth it's quite thin, bland, loose of texture and with an undermalted, borderline husky character and uninteresting, poorly developed flavors of vanilla, cereal and light, thin honey."
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;5/5/18: $1.66 + tax at Binny's. 12 oz pour into into chalice. Light copper bronze pour, one finger white puffy head, thin lacing remains. Light malt and cinnamon aroma. Very light negligible taste. Mild carbonation, thin texture. Won't seek this out again.
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;Clear gold. Grainy, full palate, sweet finish. Draft at the Brass Tap in National Harbor, Maryland.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;12oz bottle at home in a snifter. Very clear, golden amber pour with very little head. Aroma is mild caramel, Wurthers candies, un-iced doughnut, and butter. Taste is very mild (almost bland) caramel, butter, toffee, doughnut. Very thin mouth, rather slick oil. Pretty unimpressive.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from notes. Pours a clear dark golden/light brown color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have lightly toasted bready malts, straw, light fruit, mild earthy hops, rather bland.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Pours coppery orange with white foamy head and minimal lacing. An underwhelming fall ale that has very few aromas and tastes like citrus and sweet malts. My least favorite Abita beer so far.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Found this one to be a bit watered down. Aside from that it’s what you would expect from a fall beer - on the darker side, with a maltier taste. Was not impressed.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;12oz bottle pours with a crystal clear copper body that has thick gold edges and supports a thin mocha colored head. The aroma offers up winter spices, a spicy maple note and some malts. The taste has some nice winter spiciness and a bit of spicy maple like notes and then it slides deep into sugar sweet maltiness. Behind those notes are some sweet apple and pear like fruity esters that only build onto the sweetness. This would be more enjoyable if it had better balance between all the sweetness and the slightly roasty to spicy notes.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Aroma Is sour pissy, pilsner. Color is clear dark yellow. Zero head. Tastes is crisp hops and barley, but no depth. Sour aftertaste. Feel is flat. Disappointed. Poor beer. Yuck.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Bottle from North Park Liquor store: Created a thin layer of film covering for a head while the color of the beer is a solid gold as if king Midas himself had touched the liquid. My nose detects a faint aroma of grained wheat and grassy hops with an ever present chance of alcohol. The flavor is bitter with minor amount of wheat like malt and very little notice of grassy sour notes of hops almost in a European like fashion. Overall, this is a poor attempt at a Marzen style, but this did come from Abita which hasn’t been known to impress me.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Bottle into a glass. Pours amber. Aroma of skunkiness and sweet malt. Taste is skunkiness, cereal,a slight hop bite. Good boost level though.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Pours a clear amber color with a small head that fades to bits of lacing. Aroma is on the mild side with roasted malt, bit of malt sweetness and a bit of hops in the background. Taste of roasted malt, bit of caramel sweetness and a hint of chocolate. Has a subtle bitterness and a clean finish. Fairly medium body, crisp, quite smooth and refreshing. Not a fancy Oktoberfest, but still enjoyable.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Draught @ The Ginger Man, NYC. Pours clear amber with smll off-white head. Clear aroma of malt with hoppy and estery touches. Sweetish, eatery flavour with a good deal of skunk and malt. Skunky aftertaste. Nothing really special.
Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;"A reliable and well-distributed beer in Norleans. Hoppier than most browns, and that;s important to me. Malt that's rich but not sweet, toasted grains, a tad of chocolate. Aroma more on the sweet side, with toffee and a little sawdust."
Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;zapach przyjemny, średnio intensywny, ciepły, karmelowy, bardzo lekka kawa zbożowa, pieczone żołędzie, trochę spieczonej skórki od chleba, całość dość wytrawna. kolor ciemnoczerwony wpadający w brąz, klarowny, piana średnio obfita, dość trwała, beżowa. w smaku intensywne, pełne, wyraźny, dość ciemny karmel, melasa, sporo cierpkich, suchych ziół, trochę ciemnego toffi, okrągłe, lekko biszkoptowe. goryczka umiarkowana, karmelowa, ziołowa, lekko alkoholowa. w ustach pełne, okrągłe, lekko garbnikowe, ale przyjemnie. nasycenie umiarkowane
Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;Bottle share at Craft Beer Rising 2017, Brick Lane. Deep ruby and hazy with an offwhite head. Malty aroma with nutty and grassy notes. Flavour is a little on the sweet side with biscuity, cakey notes.
Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;Draught @ Fox & Hounds, Sønderborg, Øllets Day 2019. Pours cloudy coffee brown with airy light tan head. Mild aroma of malt and yeast, with coffeelike touches. Bitter, roasty flavour with notes of hops and nuts and sweetish touches of yeast and malt. Roasty and nutty aftertaste with estery hints. Tame. Drinkable and reasonable but much less than what used to. e the standard for the brewery. Go back to your no le roots, Abita.
Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;This bottle is coming from the biervana, at Munich, enjoying and tasting this bottle, at home, at Epalinges, two days ago. The body is dark and brown, a bit troubled, normal carbonation, thin white and brown foam. In my point of view, it is a reasonable brown ale, not bad at all, with a touch of malt, nuts, bready, dry with a classical touch of hop, at the final.
Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;Bottle, 5.6%. Bready aroma. Very dark brown colour. Small light brown head. The flavour has some brown sugar. Low bitterness. Fruity finish.
Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;Robe brun très sombre, mousse brun clair, correcte. Nez riche: noix, fruits secs, puissant. Bouche légèrement amère, grillée, toastée, avec beaucoup de fruits secs. Texture plutôt sèche. C'est un peu raide mais original. Presque aqueux.
Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;Bottle. 5.6%. Best before 01.10.20. Pours a clear, deep reddish amber/chestnut brown, with a light tan head. Okay lacing. Sweetish, (overripe) fruit and light malty aroma, with a hint of cooked vegetables. Remote hint of rubber as it warms, followed by a hint of nuts. Flavour is (dark) fruity, malty. Light metallic overtone. Bitter finish, hint of chocolate. A wee bit dry. Ashy hint. Mild alcohol burn. Lingering grassy note. Overall so-so. Generic and unbalanced. 22.07.19.
Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;Dark brown. Bready aroma. Suryp. Bread. Caramel. Malty. Nice, but musty. Basement.

Fischer Adelscott;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Heineken (France);18.04.2019 -- 0.5l can from geant casino in st louis, bb 03.2020. pours a clear deep golden with a frothy head. aroma of peat/whisky. flavour of peat, caramel, malts. bittersweet finish. too sweet and artificial.
Fischer Adelscott;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Heineken (France);Gefunden 2015 in einem Laden für französische Spezialitäten in Wien. Gebraut mit Whiskey-Malz. Das merkt man auch beim Geschmack -eine Malzigkeit, welche in einen ordentlichen Whiskeygeschmack inne hat. Mir persönlich ist das zuviel, da es schnell widerlich wird, da auch ein gammliger Fruchtgeschmack dazukommt. Nett anzuschauen, aber brauche ich nicht mehr.
Fischer Adelscott;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Heineken (France);Or sombre, ambré clair, limpide, mousse abondante et assez tenace, visqueuse et épaisse. Nez plutôt gourmand, brioché et sucré, dominante maltée. En bouche, c'est sucré, pas mal sucré pour un corps assez classique. Les arômes briochés sont là mais ce sucre, ça fait assez artificiel. Je ne sens ni fumé, ni grillé, rien d'une scotch ale. On est vraiment ans une bière aromatisée, qui malgré son sucre n'est pas écoeurante, mais se révèle plutôt cache-misère. Du sucre sur un fond de lager de base. Ce n'est pas aussi dégueu que dans mon souvenir (servi plus fraîche ?), mais c'est loin d'être bon.
Fischer Adelscott;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Heineken (France);Certes c'est une bière aromatisé avec du marketing dedans, mais ça marche bien. Belle robe rousse. Goût équilibré, un peu toasté avec une pointe de caramel et très légèrement fumé. Agréable.
Fischer Adelscott;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Heineken (France);Bottle from a bar in Juan les Pins. Barman smirked when I ordered this after a Leffe. Clear sign but it was the only tick. Bad. Flat beer with minimal hop and a chemical aftertaste that I guess was meant to be whisky. Not nice at all.
Fischer Adelscott;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Heineken (France);Birra particolare con aggiunta di whisky. Profuma e ha un gusto molto particolare. O si ama alla follia o si evita. A me piace tanto.

Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;Bottle at home. I used to drink loads of these, but this is the first since I started keeping records. This is a very good bitter and one that I would quite happily recommend to anyone. Lots of malt and balancing bitter hops with rich mouthfeel all wrapped up in a low abv. I had this with my Sunday roast dinner and it was a perfect match. A classic.
Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;Review from memory for personal records. Had a malt dominance, but cannot recall full tasting notes. I’ve written 4/5 in my 1001 Beers guide, and whilst this seems a little high, I will honour my original rating.
Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;historical back log rating so no notes on aroma / taste / palate . Just the rating saved
Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;Bottle, local supermarket, from backlog. Poured dark amber to pale brown in colour with a small just off-white head. Aromas of hop, fruit, caramel, bread and light floral notes. Moderate sweetness and bitterness. Medium body, slight oily and watery texture, soft to average carbonation. Better than it’s replacement.
Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;From old tasting notes. Originally labeled as Suffolk Extra Ale. Copper red color. Rocky beige head. Nice floral hop aroma. Dryish toasted malt flavor with a hint of spruce and spicy hops.
Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;Bottle from old backlog notes. Pours a hazy orange amber brown color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor had sweet malts, toffee, caramel, aged fruits with mild bitterness to the finish. A tick is a tick.

Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;Cask black rock wakefield. Dark amber colour. Good white head great lacing. Aroma is biscuity malts. Taste is malty bitter finish. Thin body. Nothing special about this one but ok.
Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;"@ Sergio’s Louisville Hazy dark amber with a 1/2"" head that lasts, dots and splotches of lace. Taste is caramel malt with molasses and dark toast that moves smoothly through the palate to a mild floral hop finish. Taste is far bigger than one would expect from 4.5% abv, a terrific session brew. Seeing that it is retired is unfortunate, and makes no sense (unless Broadside provides most of the sales?) Highly recommended."
Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;Tried for the first time back in 2011 on a trip to the brewery. Pours golden, bright and clean. Nice floral hoppiness, some citrus finish. Just now getting to transferring the rating.

Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;August 12th, 2012 - Traveling in your 20’s should be day after day of walking, meeting quirky locals, and enduring hardships for the sake of experience. But when you travel with the family, it’s important to make concessions. Cruise ships are a little dull for those looking to put boot-to-dirt, even if you’re on a floating city plowing the waters around Alaska. However, my family made a concession for me when a few agreed to make the trip out to Alaskan Brewing Company with me. The facility is surprisingly small, but that left plenty of time in the tasting room taking in the relatively small offering on tap. I began with their Pale, a Golden Ale that clearly fit Alaska’s verdant summer better than their winter. It’s a a deep blonde with a small, frazzled head, and has a distinct Northwestern hoppy profile with gentle touches of grapefruit. The malt profile is gentle and light, masked partially by a fizzy carbonation, a short aftertaste, and a simplicity that lends this to being a sessionable brew.
Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;A - pours clear darker golden straw with 1 finger white head. S - a quiet pale. Aromas of soap, pine needles, and tropical fruit. M - light with average carb. Some malty chewiness on the palate. T - tropical fruit, light soapy notes, lemon zest and pine. Very light bready and caramel malts. Some sort of sweet tart like chalky candy as well. O - nice an drinkable. Super simple blandish pale. 3
Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;Best by 24JAN13 Pours light golden with a solid soapy white foam sheet. Smells of grass, lime, citrus some light grain. Simple nose. Taste is grainy, light malt, some golden raisins and juice with some hints of metal. A really simple, refreshing character. Light bodied with prickly, present carb and a dry finish. Nice beer, but more of a pilsner for the most part. Serving type: bottle 12-14-2012
Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;light orange. No head. Tangerine nose. Nice balance. I get bananas and jelly beans in taste. Pretty sweet. Maybe there’s a hint of walnuts
Alaskan ESB;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Alaskan Brewing Company;From Mar 2006 Poured from bottle(room temp) a reddish gold with a large head of foam that dissipated slowly. The smell is a sweet malt that has notes of caramel. The taste is a very nice balance between the malt and hops..both sweet and bitter notes are there but they work so darned well together that neither one takes center stage and that's the beauty of this ESB. Yum. Bottom line: A very solid ESB that I'll gladly drink more of and recommend.
Alaskan ESB;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Alaskan Brewing Company;This beer pours a copper color with a small ring around the top. The nose is citrusy hops, so much so its IPA like the moderate caramel malty backbone shows up after it warms. The flavor is pretty spot on with that nose, with the hops showing at first but then the bready caramel malts take over. Everything is pretty mellow, smooth with a touch of bitterness. Not a bad beer at all.

Adler Brau Belgium-Luxembourg Mixed Up Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;"Dark orange color. Not much head. Very pleasing sweet smell. Wow, more complex than I'd expected. Some citrus taste (grapefruit maybe?), something kind of flowery as well. There's also a darker malty taste, possibly caramel. Goes down easily. This beer is a fantastic find from this tiny little brewery. I'm going to have to look hard for some more of this, as the store I got it at doesn't have it anymore, but it'll be worth the effort. By the way, the bottle says nothing about the beer itself, but gives the story behind the name: ""In Wisconsin many have wondered why there are so many Belgiums living in the town of Luxemburg, and so many Luxemburgs living in Belgium. As legend has it, the government was at fault. The town charters were mixed up when they were delivered."""

Barley Creek Antler Brown Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;"Poured into a pint glass at 50 degrees full review at http://lownobudgetreviews.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/barley-creek-brewing-company-tannersville-pa-navigator-angler-and-antler/ (Ryan’s Reviews) In general, I’m not a fan of brown ales. I think they are… well… kind of boring. ANTLER pours a rich mahogany brown that lets off some red tones when held up to the light, and is a bit more visually appealing than many brown ales I’ve had. It’s capped with a fluffy off-white head that dissipates pretty rapidly and leaves just a bit of lacing behind. Taking a whiff, there is just not too much there. There is some nice maltiness, and a bit of nice medium body to the aroma. The taste is a pretty average brown ale flavor to me; the malt has a medium balance to it, neither too dark and astringent nor too light and golden. There are some hops on the back end, not much bitterness, and almost no hop aroma to speak of. The flavor has just a hit of nut – like walnut or hazelnut – and a very mild caramel undertone, which I wished were more pronounced. ANTLER is pretty thin and smooth, with very light carbonation, and not nearly as substantial as it looks. The body of the beer was not too much heavier than water, which for many would be a good thing; this makes ANTLER a very easy to drink beer, if this is your style. For me, brown ales are just not something I really enjoy, and ANTLER didn’t do too much to change my mind."
Barley Creek Antler Brown Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Nice malt sweetness on the nose. Pours lehigh brown. A hint of caramel on the tongue but fades quickly. All things being equal, I prefer my brown ale from Newcastle.
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewery. Basic beer, malty and mildly hoppy. Not much flavor. Get it for your girlfriend.

Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;"Poured into a Jester King tulip at 50 degrees Full review at http://lownobudgetreviews.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/barley-creek-brewing-company-tannersville-pa-navigator-angler-and-antler/ (Ryan’s Reviews) NAVIGATOR comes out of the bottle a mix of gold and copper that is truly beautiful to look at and just LOOKS refreshing. A vigorous pours yields a pretty light head of bright white, rather large bubbles that fade away quickly. Taking it to my nose, I get a slight Hefeweizen like scent to NAVIGATOR; it’s got some banana notes and an overall mild bouquet. On the palate, NAVIGATOR starts somewhat sweet, but not overly so, and ends slightly bitter. It has a mild spice to it, and a Belgian undertone to the essence it brings. NAVIGATOR is not a tripel, but it is in the neighborhood… it’s almost like a tripel-light! It’s very light, and refreshing, and would make a good summer-outside-on-a-hot-day kind of beer. To add to this nice hot day note is the mouthfeel of the beer: NAVIGATOR is rich and slightly velvety without moving into being thick or heavy. I enjoyed NAVIGATOR, especially for a style that is not one of my favorites. Golden Ales are hit or miss for me; too many end up as an overpriced version of Budweiser, but NAVIGATOR is much more like a Belgian beer’s little brother. NAVIGATOR is great way to get a bit of the Belgian style without getting into the high ABV that a standard tripel normally packs, and on a hot day I take it hands down over the average American Adjunct Lager any day of the week. Of course, I’d also take water over AAL any day of the week, but you get my point…"
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Not a lot of aroma with this one. Color of straw and the taste of water. Leaves no lacing and has no palate.It doesn’t really do anything. Not a great start.
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Had on draft at the brewery. Poured a clear gold color with slight fizzy white head. Aroma is bit sweet and grassy, but not much to it. Flavor reminds me of some homebrew extract cream ales I’ve made. Dry and bitter, with more body and flavor than most golds. Bit of lemon zest. Overall, decent on a hot day.
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;On draught at the brewery in Penn: For someone like myself who doesn’t particularly like the goldens, this one wasn’t half bad.

It’s a 3rd beer, with a 3rd disappointment. I hoped to have a crispy smooth ale, what I found was a complicated taste. It was like yeasty apple juiced beer. Not pleasant in smell. Appearance was the best of the categories, with a nice head. It’s taste was just unusual. Palate was smooth. Wierd!!!
Cider Jack Hard Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);"This is my first cider review, so might be off on some things. I prefer the old school ciders that were unfiltered kinda like apple juice. When I describe a beer on here as ""looking like apple cider"", I am not referring to this light clear pale appearance. This looked like slightly colored water to me. Looked and tasted a lot like a white wine, but as I drank more of it I tasted the apple. I had a few hard ciders before this that I liked (which I'll resample and review), but this was my least favorite of the small bunch."

Aroma is apple, pear, and a slight amount of plastic. Flavor is tart apple and what seems like a small amount of wood. The body is light, the finish is dry, and the carbonation is almost equivalent to that of a champagne. Definately a more european style of cider and a decent one at that. Based on some of the reviews, it seems as though they have been playing with this recipe. People mention sweet but this is one of the driest ciders i’ve had in a while.
Big Rock Köld;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;Originally rated July 2006. This lager is gold in colour with tiny bubbles coming up from 3-4 different spots.

Big Rock Grasshopper Kristallweizen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Wheat Ale;Big Rock Brewery;If you are expecting a lovely murky wheaty beer, this isn’t it... Kristall it may be, but the wheat is minimal - more like a pilsner with a bit of doughy ’warm bread’ aroma. Poured cold from a bottle into a glass, it has that slight aroma of not-very-fresh bread which dissipates even though there is minimal foam and almost no lace. The colour is a nice gold-amber though, and clear, unlike the usual hefeweizen. I found it a bit sweet to start - light, getting heavier down the glass. Like most N American beers it leaves a lingering sticky feeling, making me want a glass of water... obviously it isn’t thirst-quenching in that respect. Perhaps I’ll revert to a practice I learned in Edmonton of adding a dash of salt (presumably to replace the dehydration in summer days, but it did add sweetness to the beer)... purist may yell, but right now I’m ambivalent towards it. Light of body, sticky aftertaste, average carbonation with a long thick finish, medium sweetness, and slightly sour,

Big Rock Warthog English Style Mild Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Brown Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Everything a mild English ale should be. Nice caramel sweetness, but keeping a light body and clean finish. Poured with a pillowy cream-coloured head.
Big Rock Warthog English Style Mild Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Brown Ale;Big Rock Brewery;"Pours with a little head and some lacing and reddish brown. Tastes of honey and grain. Light on the hopes or malt. Hard to taste the ""English Style"". Not ""orrible"" but not a stand-out"
Big Rock Warthog English Style Mild Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Brown Ale;Big Rock Brewery;No head and a heavily carbonated light copper body. Lots of roasted malt on the nose, some breadiness, nothing exciting. Flavour is a metallic sweet malt with some fake smoke. An Englishman would be horrified by this kind of ale, and me as a Canadian am just hugely disappointed.
Big Rock Warthog English Style Mild Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Brown Ale;Big Rock Brewery;"341ml bottle from Beer Store in Toronto. This beer is exactly what it says it is: an English style mild ale. A rich body that goes down easily, with very little bitterness. Serve at 10 - 15 degrees C, of course. Don’t be fooled by the name ""Warthog"" ... it’s not an aggressive ale - as the commercial description explains, it is designed to quench the thirst of an English big game hunter on an African safari!"
Big Rock Warthog English Style Mild Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Brown Ale;Big Rock Brewery;On tap at Smith. Pours a clear amber gold with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has notes of bread and straw supported by a touch of earthiness. Flavor has notes of grain and bread, but is a bit thin.
Big Rock Warthog English Style Mild Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Brown Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Pours clear pale amber with one finger of loose off-white head diminishing rapidly to a thin skim, no lacing. (2/5) Nose is light malt, mild citrus and grassy. (5/10) Taste is mild sweet, moderate bitter. (5/10) Light to medium bodied, prickly to moderate carbonation, off-dry crisp finish. (3/5) Quite boring. Mild, sure, and no real negatives, but really quite boring. (10/20)
Big Rock Warthog English Style Mild Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Brown Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Can: Slightly hazed yellow-amber with a small, off-white head. Caramel, lightly woody aroma. Flavour is caramel malt, bread...slightly lactic, with a weak leafy bitter. Just barely ok...very watery...misses the style by a wide margin.
Big Rock Warthog English Style Mild Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Brown Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Can. Lightly lactic caramel malt aroma. Golden yellow with moderate head. Lightly sweet toffee malt and lightly bitter herbal flavor. Watery palate. I get not calling this a mild ale but I thought one of the requirements of being a brown ale was that it should be brown.
Big Rock Warthog English Style Mild Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Brown Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Draft at Gourmet Bistro Toronto. Pours a clear, caramel/copper with a thin, off white head that stick to the glass. Aroma has nice notes of caramel, toffee, slight fruit esters, and traditional hops. Taste is balanced. Caramel, toffee, bread, and a short aftertaste. Medium body and carbonation. Clean and satisfying in the mouth. Overall pretty good for the style. Mild flavours of caramel, bread, and toffee.
Big Rock McNally's Extra;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Big Rock Brewery;i wish i could still find this beer. on the same vein as scottish heavy, but i seem to remember it being richer and more complex, perhaps even more bold. it was / is a fantastic beer. grab it if you can...
Big Rock McNally's Extra;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Big Rock Brewery;Light rust and some caramel. Decent body and good malt. Creamy consistency like hot butter. Amber pour with decent head and lacing. Bottle in Banff.
Big Rock McNally's Extra;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Big Rock Brewery;Amber color. Sweet and soft caramel tastes with little bit of high alcohol. Reminds me of some tripel beers. Good red ale.
Big Rock McNally's Extra;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Big Rock Brewery;330ml bottle. Pours a clear, red amber with a small, short lived, fully dissipating, off-white head. Sweet aroma of caramel malt with a hint of dark fruit. Sweet flavour of caramel malt, dark fruit and a hint of nuts with a dry, bitter, hoppy finish. Medium body with a creamy, smooth, oily texture and soft carbonation. 7% ABV is well hidden. One of their better offerings.
Big Rock McNally's Extra;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Big Rock Brewery;Appearance: clear medium amber with one finger of rocky light tan head diminishing gradually to a thin skim, patchy lacing. (3/5) Aroma: caramel malt, dark fruit, grassy and earthy, diacetyl. (6/10) Taste: moderate sweet, moderate bitter, light sour. (5/10) Medium body, medium carbonation, medium duration bitter and lightly sour finish. (3/5) Nope, sorry. I’ve tried this beer so many times over the years, but I’m just not getting any closer to liking it. It’s malt-heavy, which would be fine, but for that sour something I can’t quite identify. And it’s not a good sour, either - more like the back of the throat “hurk” when you’re trying not to puke. (10/20)
Big Rock McNally's Extra;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Big Rock Brewery;"Rather a ""meh"" appearance with modest head and bright copper body. Soft hops aroma with a hint of malt. Flavour is modestly hoppy with a hint of citrus ad rice. Just okay. first rating in many months!"
Big Rock McNally's Extra;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Big Rock Brewery;Pours a clear amber-orange with a nice size lasting foamy off-white head.

Clear, sparkling dark coppery orange with a khaki head and good lacing. Aroma of caramel, plum, fig, lemon and grapefruit. Taste of caramel, orange, toffee, plum, lemon, peach and grapefruit. Medium body and medium carbonation. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Big Rock McNally's Extra;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Big Rock Brewery;"Aroma: 4/10. Aroma slightly reminiscent of stale bananas. Caramel, hops, a grapefruit sour note. Not really pleasant. Like a grapefruit-scented cleaner. Appearance: 3/5. Pours a pretty honey brown with a thin white head and light, creamy lacing. Taste: 4/10. Meh. Sour attack with some caramel notes, too much hops in the flavoring, and overall, just not a pleasant beer past the first few sips. Palate: 4/5. Actually not at all a bad palate; smooth on the tongue and teeth, and with a pleasant crispness and astringency to the beer itself. Shame about that nauseatingly hopped finish though, but that’s a weakness of Irish style beers as a whole. Overall: 10/20. If you like irish style beers you’ll probably enjoy this a lot more than I would, but overall I just found there wasn’t much to love in this one. Pass."
Big Rock McNally's Extra;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Big Rock Brewery;Aroma is caramel, roasty malts and slight floral notes. Taste is rich maltiness with caramel, fig, and plum. Finishes with a slight bitterness that isn’t overbearing. appearance is a clear dark amber with a medium white bubbly head that retains fairly well.
Big Rock Chinook Pale Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;341mL bottle poured a pale golden color with moderate white head and no lacing. Aroma is grassy hops and bready malts. Taste is mildly sweet with a dry hoppy finish that is pleasing. Light to medium body and lightly carbonated for an easy drinking experience with none of that cheap bitterness of the macros.
Big Rock Chinook Pale Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;I have to rate this even though it is retired, and I last had it just over a year ago. I feel justified in that I used to drink a lot of this stuff, along with Canvasback, before I moved to Australia for a while. When I got back, they had retired them both, but I’ve still got a handsome set of beer glasses with the logos on them. Anyway, from what I recall, this had maybe a shadow of pale ale character at most, certainly nothing like the beautiful American pales that we get from our microbrewing neighbours to the south (and a select few Canadian ones too-- Tree Brewing for example). A beer that holds some sentimental fondness for me though.
Big Rock Chinook Pale Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;Had this one on tap at Mcnally’s Tavern in Regina. Not a lot to say here, standard Big Rock brew. Golden colour, dry drink and a nasty aftertaste.
Big Rock Chinook Pale Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;Copper, musty, dull, sweaty, hoppy pale ale. Too much malt. Not sure how they came up with the conclusion of pale ale with so much malt. Must be an alberta thing. heheheh!
Big Rock Chinook Pale Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;Toronto Festival of Beer 2001 - Unremarkable beer. Disappointing pale ale, expecting more hops and more malt.
Big Rock Chinook Pale Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;Boy, what a disapointment. A beer with Chinook as its name that has so little hop aroma or bitterness. An average ale, dry hopped or not.

Big Rock Chinook Pale Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;Golden appearance, light head. Aroma is cheesey with hints of light hops, dust and the very slightest chocolate. Body is grassy and tinny with light hops. Nothing great here.

Big Rock Chinook Pale Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;Fruity and flowery aromas, amber, mild malt taste, hint of hops, nothing special.
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;As I remember this beer, it does not bring great joy. Watered down version of previous beer, this brewery can do better. (Calgery, some years ago)
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Oh light AGD. Reviewed straight from old school blue and gold can, aesthetically pleasing. Poured some out to note clear, yellowy colour. Medium carbonation. Aroma is corn and grass. Taste is exactly the same, with a bubbly mouthfeel of plain, grainy beer. Light watery piss.
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Colour: Extremly light...almost white/yellow with decent head. Nose: Yeast, tin can, mild oats. Taste: Lot’s of malt, light cereal fade and sugar cream light finish. Better than a coors light. Creamy palate.
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Not good. Skunky, tasteless water. Horrible corn, skunk, grass aroma and flavor. Not the best light crap beer out there.
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;As far as light brews go, this one is decent enough, despite lacking real flavour, aroma and colour. Nearly invisible clear pee yellow, some large bubbs, near zero head, no lacing. Aroma of barley. Taste is kind of harsh with lots of bitterness. Barley, water, hops. Mouthfeel is rough - way too spritzy. Thin and watery - obviously. Ends dry with some unknown aftertaste. Read the fine print to find out that Big Rock spawned this liquid.
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;This is Alberta Genuine Draft with whatever meager life it has sucked out of it. It ranks among the palest beers I’ve seen, with no aroma and literally no flavour. It is like vaguely grainy soda water. Astonishingly bland.
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;"Now called Alta Light with 4% alcohol. Darkish yellow. Minimal head. Strong carbonization. Thin aroma. Subtle hop perhaps. It is not badgor what it is, just another lightly flavoured low alcohol ""lite beer""."
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Better than I thought it would be. But that's not to say that I recommend it.
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;"Draught at Big Rock Urban Brewery, Vancouver Golden colour; creamy mouthfeel, corn flavour, not much evidence of rye; clean but with no emotions."
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;[9313-20170625] Bottle. Mild rye cereal grains aroma. Light golden body with a quick foamy off-white head. More sweet cereal grains and rye bread crumbs in the flavour. Medium body. Interesting. (6/3/7/3/13) 3.2
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;2017-06-25. Quick notes: Aroma of sweetish grains. Flavour is similar, moderate cereal grains, light caramel notes. Average bodied palate, good carbonation. Simple but okay. 6/3/6/3/13-14 Bottle shared by K&V.
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Light golden body, white head. Sweet grainy aroma. Faint sweet grain taste. Pretty much like a pale lager. Not great.
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Big Rock doesn't venture too far from their tried and true recipe. This makes all their beer taste very similar, while it's good, it's nothing new or special. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Bottle (Old Notes)-Pours copper with a nice sized white head. Aroma of rye, malt, sweetness, and dough. Taste of the same with the doughness becoming more prominent. This medium bodied brew is not bad.
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Clean red color with almost zero head and no carbonation. Cheap nose, lots of corny aroma, slightly sweet and if rye is present its hard to find. Flavor starts off with a sweet corny presence at the start and a very light watery rye shows up in the middle with a metallic finish. Body is light, flat and boring. Overall a huge miss in my opinion. A very bad rye ale in this raters opinion. The rating, albeit low, is still a bit generous.
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Deep clear gold, vanishing white head. Malty caramel nose, tastes of caramel malts, spice and some fruit... an I & G wannabe?
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Bottle 5%. The pour is copper coloured, weak bubbly foam appears. The aroma is of rye, quite grainy, hint of malty sweetness. Overpowering breadiness, creamy mouthfeel, very dry and grainy into the finish. Interesting, but no lasting excitement.
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Not the same beer that I remember trying about 10 years ago. Poured from a 341mL bottle a pale golden color with small white head and spots of lacing. Aroma of grains and some grassy hops. Taste is lightly sweet malt with a light dry grassy hop finish. Decent carbonation and body give a nice mouthfeel.
Big Rock Canvasback Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;341mL bottle poured pale amber color with small white head and minimal lacing. This one has a mild aroma of some floral hops and cereal. Taste is mild malt and some nice floral hops in the finish. An easy drinking beer that is a little more complex in flavour than your standard lager and has a cleaner finish, with none of that cheap bitter aftertaste.
Big Rock Canvasback Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;Canvasback Canadian Ale--1998 22 oz. Bottle. 3.50% ABV. (2.0 / 5.0) Golden Ale. Very light golden color with almost a lager flavor. Light weak body. Mild aroma hops, but not much else. Sampled 4/11/1998.

Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Color is deep dark brown withquickly dissapearing light brown foam head. Aroma is malty, bread roasted and some chocolate. Tashe is bittersweet, toast and chocolate. More of a German Alt then a stout. (Velp)
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Draft @ Korea Location: Poured a deep black with a tan color head. Aroma is thick licorice and roasted malt. Taste is a bit sourish with some aging roasted malt.
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;341mL bottle stated 7%ABV on the label poured a deep dark brown color with a thin beige head and very light lacing. Aromas of roasted malts and chocolate and some alcohol. Taste is malty sweet and chocolate with some hop bitterness and alcohol in the finish. The body is a little thin for a stout, but overall, this is a pleasing well balanced brew.
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Bottle, sampled at Viti, pours dark reddish brown. Aroma of roasted malt, caramel and a little chocolate. Roasted flavours dominate with coffee and chocolate, and subtle fruitiness, but all watered down. How this is classified as a stout is beyond me. Drinkable.
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;***Old rating as I score all the Big Rocks I’ve had and never rated*** Pours a dark mahogany colour with a thin layer of off-white head which dissipates quickly leaving no real lacing. Scent is a smokey espresso with a slightly sweet caramel finish, but still rather mild, much like the other Big Rock flagship offerings. I would have to say that this is one of the more flavourful Big Rock offerings. The espresso malts come through, a bit of bitter dark chocolate and bit of a wooden rye flavour is also coming through. Again, it could be a bit more bold, but by far one of their most flavourful beers. A nice medium bodied offering that goes down smooth. No complaints in this department. Overall, this is by far one of the better Big Rock offerings, and I would definitely choose this one over their other beers if I were given the choice. A little light on the flavours and scent, but a decent stout nonetheless.
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Black Amber Ale, Dark Alberta Stout--1999 11.5 oz. Bottle. 5.00% ABV. (4.0 / 5.0) Porter? Deep rich clear cherry copper color.

Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Amber Ale? Stout? I agree w/ Cirrhosis, this seems to scream Porter, but I’ll rate it as a Stout just for giggles. Bottle. 5%. Dark, dark brownish copper poor with a weak tan foam that bubbles away super quickly. Aroma is roasted malts, coffee, and caramel. Taste is roast malts, with a hint of caramel sweetness. Carbonated mouthfeel for a stout, but finish is dry, quite bitter, and satisfying. $11.99/6 @ Wild Rose Liquor.
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;I am a big supporter of Big Rock beers. I have been for 15 years. This one however just seems to be off the mark for them. I always expect so much more for a stout. It has the expected dark mocha, coffee nose but just seems to fall flat in the mouth. Nowhere is the rich amber sweetness and even less present is the powerful malt stout character. It is not terrible but it certainly could be a better product. It does have their usual expert carbonation and palate feel, thank goodness!
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Don’t like this stuff. Good job on trying to peak the interest of non-educated drinkers by calling this an amber ale and a stout at the same time. Dark dark red / brown with nearly zero head poured. Aroma is not bad, I just know where they are going with this beer. It really took a long time for the aroma to come around to something worthwhile: toasted malts, cigarette smoke, chocolate and dark coffee faintly appearing. This stuff is terrible when cold. Taste is pretty good now that it’s nearing room temperature, but before was borderline. Nice malts and bitter hops are blended well, some notes of caramel and some spice. Mouthfeel is light to medium, flat but spritzy (??) with a touch of alcohol, and a dry pleasant bitter aftertaste. I like it now, but it’s been in my glass now close to an hour. It took that long to make it good. I like it better than the numbers indicate. I’ll drink this again, but only an hour out of a fridge. Other than that, a highly dissapointing misguided beer. I think I’ll go see if Big Rock has a non-alcohol IIPA Gueuze...

Amstel Light;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;"12 ounce bottle into lager glass; bottled on 9/11/2018, best before 9/2019. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with awesome retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a lightly amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light corn, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity/skunky aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light corn, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light corn, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no fruity/yeasty notes present. Moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.5%. Overall this is a good light lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish. Flavorful and not too watery for the ABV. Nice pils malt/grain showcase, with great earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Mild on the corn/adjunct presence.

Amstel Light;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;The Aromas are pale malt, wet grain, stereotypical pale lager characteristics. Flavors are like nose, more sweet with a hint bitter and some carbonation to balance. Very little going on. Also very boring. This is another one of the beers that I've rated in the past and somehow ratebeer has canceled my former review.

Amstel 1870;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Heineken Nederland;Butelka 300 ml, prezent od Domi Kapturkiewicz. Klasyk, prościutko z Holandii i lepiej dla niego, że pity w wersji pilsner. Barwa piękna złocista, piana nie za wysoka, ale o dziwo zostawia lacing. Średnie wysycenie do dużego. W aromacie niestety słód, w smaku z lekka czuć tego wymarzonego pilsnera, ale do Czechów sporo brak. Znośne.

Amstel Gold;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pilsener - Imperial;Heineken Nederland;Wat ik mij hiervan kan herinneren is dat het alcoholpercentage wat hoger lag dan de gewone pilsener, en dat als je het is je glas schonk de schuimkraag na het knipperen van je ogen alweer was vertrokken. De smaak deed wat appel en perzikachtig aan met een plakkerig zoet mondgevoel en een irritante alcoholgeur die van het bier afkwam. Nee mensen, dit was niet best.

Amstel Gold;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pilsener - Imperial;Heineken Nederland;Is dit wel dezelfde Amstel Gold uit die ranke flesjes, die vroeger het enige redelijke alternatief bij mening chinees restaurant waren?

Amstel Malt;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Heineken Nederland;The label 'malt' denotes n/a beers in the Netherlands... but malt is one of the things you don't taste much of in this brew, another being hops. Funnily enough, I can easily tolerate this beer in a café on the Dutch coast, but would never dream of buying it at home. I suppose my beer expectations are generally pretty low in the Netherlands, thanks to Heineken. Perhaps it is time to invest a little effort and find a good Dutch beer - I'm sure they exist.

Nose very neutral, only a slight sweetish maltiness; same for the taste, neutral, just a tad malty, mouthfeel very watery, practically no finish at all, just a very faint and very brief bitterishness. Not off-putting but bordering on tasteless and therefore completely pointless, like most alcohol-free ’beers’."
Amstel Malt;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Heineken Nederland;bottle @ a restaurant in Haarzuilens. Golden color white head higher carbon beer. Bittersweet taste, bitter aftertaste.

Amstel Malt;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Heineken Nederland;Somewhere between a pale lager low alcohol beer and a malt drink. Medium amber with no head to speak of. Smells of malt, cabbage, grain, sour and sweet caramel sugar. Medium thin body with soft carbonation. Tastes of sweet malt and caramel like a malt drink but with a cardboard and forced carbonation club soda element. The sweetness dominates as as a lover of malt drinks this isn’t half bad. One thing to note is that my bottle is one year and three months over date which may explain why the carbonation is soft and the some of the likely poorer elements subdued.

Цвет темно коричневый, пенка пышная, серая. По телу сразу понятно что пиво с характером. Ощущаются ноты хлеба, при чем так и белого так и черного. Карамель есть но быстро исчезает, больше сходит на ирис что ли. Алкоголь немного есть на языке при глотке. Такое добротное среднее крепкое пиво, есть нотки от стилей вроде дупель бока. Неплохо для массового пива.

Anchor Steam Beer;San Francisco, California, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);"Very interesting and refreshing beer to drink in the summer.. It remind me little bit some belgium beers on the colour and on the taste like ""Pauwel Kwak"" and ""Leffe Blond"" but with much more higher carbonation.. And yes the carbonation here is insane and that little trouble you to get some more flavors.. The taste is more on the bitter direction and specially in the aftertaste that you get high rate bitterness.. And is a very malty beer.. Overall is a decent beer to drink in the summer everywhere you are.. Is better from the most ""Lager"" beers out there and that is the fact.."

Aromat: Na pierwszym planie kwiaty z subtelną nutą cytrusów i żywicy, uzupełnionymi średnią słodowością chlebową i akcentem miodowym. Smak: Kwiatowo - żywiczny z lekkimi, ale wyraźniejszymi aniżeli w aromacie cytrusami oraz średnio - niską słodowością chlebową z nutą miodu. W ustach półwytrawne, gładkie z średnią gorzkością żywiczną i subtelną kwaśnością. Treściwość średnia, wysycenie niskie. Goryczka średnia, albedo z grejpfruta i żywicy, średniej długości. Finisz wytrawny z przyjemnie pozostającą goryczką chmielową i nutą cytrusów. Ogólnie kawał historii, nie można oceniać intensywności aromatu i smaku nowofalowych chmieli patrząc przez pryzmat dzisiejszych APA. Goryczka bardzo fajna, życzyłbym sobię takiej w każdej apie.

Rich taste as well, dark fruit, chocolate, and smooth initially, with some bitterness coming through in the middle, leading to a relatively dry finish and bitterness lingering on the tongue, along with the very flavorful malt body - again, hints of caramel, chocolate, dark fruit, and roasted malts. The body is medium, tending toward substantial, especially for a porter. Overall, a well-constructed porter. Rich and complex flavor, good body, roasted malts complemented by sweet caramel, raisins, and chocolate, moderated by the hop bitterness. The finish is relatively dry, but with hints of the sweetness remaining. Top notch. Extremely enjoyable and flavorful.

Anchor Porter;San Francisco, California, United States;Porter;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);"I expecting much more things from that ""Porter"" and from that ""Brewery"" but it seems is not for me.. All beers from them had one specific character inside that trouble me.. They have some kind ""Hoppy"" and some extra bitterness and that is not my cup of tea. Anyway this ""Porter"" it taste completely different against the ""Fuller's porter"" that is the king of the style.. Is much more bitter than sweet and has more carbonation inside.. Also you can feel less coffe and chocolate here and some kind extra bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall i can't be objective with that beer and these breweries from ""U.S"" that have some extra ""Hoppy"" character.. If you like the ""Hoppy"" and bitter beers definitely try this one.."

The nose was a malty sweet, Barleywine-like scent, dark fruit as plum & prune, subtle holiday spice, and a touch of lurking alcohol? Light to medium bodied, the taste was similar notes, and also included a slight woody/cedar hint? Texture was a little thinned, and there was almost no effervescence, but that was okay with me. Turned out to be a fairly tasty & successful cellar experiment, with no noticeable oxidation, and just reduced, all around character.

Flavor is similar with sweet corn and some cereal grain, I can’t believe this held up as well as it did....
Anchor Wheat Beer 3.9% (-2008);San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Soft nose of grain and mild citrus. Slight DMS, clean quaffing brew. Nice hot weather brew.
Anchor Wheat Beer 3.9% (-2008);San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Poured a pale straw color with a foamy, bright white head that shrunk to a thin sheet in moments. The nose was sweet and musty with caramel, wheat, rice and corn. The taste started with an wheaty/oakiness followed by a welcome sweetness that tried to balance out the unpleasant, astringent-esque, wooddiness. The end had a dark tasting bitterness and was followed by a mustiness that seemed to last from beginning to end. The mouthfeel was light and the CO2 was a little coarse. Although light and drinkable, I had no desire to try this again. A disappointing offering from Anchor. Maybe my expectations were too high.
Anchor Wheat Beer 3.9% (-2008);San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);I love this stuff. My local 19th hole got this as a mistake many years ago and I went back every night to get more. I am so bummed that Anchor is no longer producing this one as it is one of the best American-brewed Hefeweizens I’ve ever had. Good hearty flavor, rich texture, even better with a slice of orange floating on top.
Anchor Wheat Beer 3.9% (-2008);San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Pours golden and clear with a fizzy head. Smells of caramel, some wheat, hints of underlying sweetness. Tastes crisp and dry with just a hints of underlying sweetness but otherwise not much else to speak of. Mouthfeel is thin with a finish that is crisp. Inoffensive and bland compared to just about all their other offerings.
Anchor Wheat Beer 3.9% (-2008);San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Nice wheat beer. An americanized version of the bavarian original. It’s ok. Is clean, with decent body and finish. Just like the bavarians much better. standard appearance. Having this on draft at Bodega Brew Pub, downtown La Crosse, WI.

Anchor Wheat Beer 3.9% (-2008);San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Very bland, a drinkable brew, but so uncharacteristic of a wheat beer, not much flavor, abit sweet, but probably my least favorite Anchor beer.
Anchor Wheat Beer 3.9% (-2008);San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Not a terribly bad beer. A summer wheat beer. Not much to say about it, but it sure isn’t a bad one. Give it a try! Wheaty.
Chimay Brune / Bruin (Rouge / Red);Baileux, Belgium;Dubbel;Chimay;Maybe I shouldn´t be rating this beer, I know this beer has a lot of fans all over, but I can´t say that I am one of them. For me this beer taste like fermented mud.

Chimay Triple (Blanche / White);Baileux, Belgium;Tripel;Chimay;330ml bottle in 2012. Hazy straw colour with a big white head. Aroma of yeasty esters, musty fruit, peal, coriander and soft sugars. Big flavours, with bready malt, cloves, leafy notes, light peppercorn and soft fruit. Very nice linger.
Chimay Triple (Blanche / White);Baileux, Belgium;Tripel;Chimay;Nice hazy coloured triple. Smells sweet and tastes hoppy, grassy with a tad malt added to the mix, love chimay beers!
Chimay Triple (Blanche / White);Baileux, Belgium;Tripel;Chimay;About 35 years ago, i could find many equal or even better tripel beers. During the years, i have the idea that tripels have gathered more sugar, Cylantro and orange peel. That makes nice beers but as Chimay did not change a lot, the beer has become quite unique in it's traditional triple style.
Chimay Triple (Blanche / White);Baileux, Belgium;Tripel;Chimay;Shared bottle at home. Pours hazy amber with dense off-white head. Aroma of ripe fruits, pepper, some malty notes, ethanol. Tastes sweet with quite some bitterness. Medium bodied, alcoholic warmth, sweet finish.
Chimay Triple (Blanche / White);Baileux, Belgium;Tripel;Chimay;Flaska från Belgien, hos Lukas. Klar guldig med hög vit krona. Typiska tripeltoner med snygg sötma med mycket honungstoner. Gott och cleant.
Chimay Triple (Blanche / White);Baileux, Belgium;Tripel;Chimay;A very nice triple though not my personal favourite. Not that sweet and more hoppy than bitter. A fine drink just better ones out there.
Chimay Triple (Blanche / White);Baileux, Belgium;Tripel;Chimay;0.33l bottle from Belga Sörök Háza. Hazy orange body, off-thick foam, not lasting very long but lacing remains intensive. Moderate fruity aromas, tutti frutti, bubble gum, raisins. Taste is fruity, yeasty. Very complex, peach, banana, raisins all detectable. Some spicy honey. Also very harmonic and well balanced. Strong and persistent dry bitter aftertaste with fruity notes. Strong carbonation, fizzy palate, like champagne. Very good stuff.
Chimay Triple (Blanche / White);Baileux, Belgium;Tripel;Chimay;75cl bottle with cork stopper. Pours a hazy golden colour with a foaming head of tight bubbles. Excellent lacing. The aroma is fruity and spicy. The taste has great depth with delicious flavours of sweet grapes, yeast and spices. Very fruity and notes of white pepper and nutmeg. Great appearance, very good carbonation and wonderful mouthfeel. A really great tasting beer.
Chimay Triple (Blanche / White);Baileux, Belgium;Tripel;Chimay;"A very unique and a different ""Tripel"" from the others of the style.. This beer remind you little the ""Red"" and the ""Blue"" from the same ""Brewery"" but at 80% is a completely different beer. First of all is a very strong and punchy beer with high rate carbonation but that can't distract you to get the flavors.. All here playing a role and made this beer amazing.. The alcohol is very well hide and the fruity taste of the beer cover it very good...For sure very balance beer and one of the best of the style and in general.. It's rich, punchy, refreshing with amazing taste and great aftertaste.. Overall i believe is the most balance from the ""Chimay"" series.. You can drink it any season you want dispate the weather outside.. Is rich and warming very well your mouth and also is very refreshing.. Combined two differents things and that is the fact for me.."
Chimay Triple (Blanche / White);Baileux, Belgium;Tripel;Chimay;Big 750 ml bottle. Beautiful clear orange/amber color with an initially big puffy white head (apparently from very energetic carbonation) that seems to die quickly. Belgian yeast, light sugar sweetness and a light mustiness in the aroma. Unlike a lot of Tripels, this one is not that sweet and has a fairly light body. Just a touch of vanilla in the taste, but mostly a sharp (and delicious) bitterness of dehydrated oranges and citrus peel. The balance here though is quite nice if a bit on the thin side. There's some heat, but not what I would expect from a Triple. Finishes dry, woody and pithy with a lasting bitter bite all over the mouth. Not what I was expecting, but definitely a very well made and enjoyable beer.
Yates Wight Winter;Sandown, Isle Of Wight, England;Stout;Yates (Isle of Wight);Cask (handpump) at the Great British Beer Festival Day 3, August 2006. Dark brown with a red tinge. Slightly sulphurous aroma. Quite tart with an acidic, vaguely lactic finish. Lots of malty fruit in the flavour. Difficult to place style-wise - as much like a porter, or even an old ale, as a stout. An interesting and quite agreeable beer.
Yates Wight Winter;Sandown, Isle Of Wight, England;Stout;Yates (Isle of Wight);Cask, Newark Winter Fest 09. Near black with red tints and a beige foam. Aromas are earthy roast malts with chocolate and yeast. Flavours are roast coffee malts wit light berries. Bitter towards the finish. Peppery. OK.

Sour wood and berries in aroma along with some smoked wood. Flavour is much the same. Some oak as well. Bitter and dry in the finish. Something in the aroma and flavour makes me not like it too much

Yates Wight Winter;Sandown, Isle Of Wight, England;Stout;Yates (Isle of Wight);Bottle.Is this really a stout or a dark bitter-my money is on the latter. Pored with a small head with a pleasant and subtle maltiness. Nice dry fiinnish. Drinkable and pleasant.
Yates Wight Winter;Sandown, Isle Of Wight, England;Stout;Yates (Isle of Wight);Cask at GBBF 2006 as Yates St. Lawrence Ale. A very dark brown beer with a reddish shine and a rim of brown head. The aroma is sweet malty combined with notes of caramel, and light notes of hops. The flavor is sweet with strongest notes of caramel, but also some malt notes. OK, but nothing special.
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);500ml bottle in 2015. Black with a beige head. Aroma of roasted malt, light coffee and vanilla. Medium to full body. Some nice roasty notes. A lot better without the nitrogen!
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Good thing I checked database. This is the Guinness they have in my office in Belfast. Quite roasty and more earthy than states. More herbal characters. Smooth and thin less creamy than pasteurized which I guess makes sense
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);A average, light tasting stout. Malty and toffee aroma and taste. Some sweet, fruity and fragrant notes, with light malts and coffee stout flavour. Very carbonated. But not as smooth or strong as other stouts.
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);"Flasche 0,5l (as 'Extra Stout' - ABV: 4.1%): Schwarz, trüb mit kräftigem stabilen Schaum; die Nase angenehm mit leichter Süße, kräftigem Malzzucker, dunklen Beeren, schwarzen Kirschen, Röstaromen; würziger Antritt, cremig mit angenehmer Bitterkeit und einem trocken-würzigen Nachgang"
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);500ml bottle brewed in Dublin at 4.2%. Stonking pale-beige Guinness microbubble head, developing Swiss-cheese type cavitation and eventually remaining for a very long time as thin froth. Faint pear and toffee aromas. Dark brown so as to be off-black. Low carbonation. Dark chocolate sweetness and roast coffee bitterness battle it out to coat your mouth. Classic tasty porter experience.
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);(Bottle) Pours black with big tan head. Nice aroma of smoke, nuts, roast malt. Light body and rather fizzy. Taste of roast malts, some dark toffee and tartness. Rather disappointing (I expected more for a Guinness brewed in Dublin), but very drinkable.

Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Quite a difference from the can or draught version. Pours really dark brown with tan head.

Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Bottle from the Lazy Dog. Dark brown in color with a hint of garnet and a decent sized tan head that slowly recedes. Earthy roasty and light cocoa with bits of licorice and dark dried fruits. Pretty tasty easy to drink stout.

Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;12oz bottle, at the hotel before a Braves game. Clear light brown with a thin white head. Some caramel and toffee notes, bready malt. Light bodied, medium carb. Sweet finish. (notes)
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Copper red color. Big fluffy beige head. Interesting, earthy toasted malt nose. Tangy malt flavor hints at curry and cardamom. Good flavor.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;This was poured into a becher pint glass. The appearance was a moderately dark orange to ruddy brown color with a finger’s worth of messy foamy head. Dissipates at a nice level pace and leaves some stringy lace sliding right on into the beer. The aroma leans to the sweet side with some roasty nuts, caramel and toffee malt goodness. Dosed with some earthy hops far underneath. The flavor once again, leans to the sweet side and grabs the earthy hops to try and balance a bit more. Do they? Well, somewhat. I feel like I’m grasping at straws trying to find something more out of this beer. No aftertaste but a quick clean sweet malty finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation feels decent on my tongue. Overall, decent as an English brown ale and I could see myself coming back to if given the chance but not exactly a superior one of it’s style.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Rating from old records. From bottle in shaker: aroma could be mistaken for a good candy bar. Malt-driven taste that finishes a bit sweeter than an English Brown.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Pours a nice dark brown color. Aromas of nuts/chocolate/caramel. Flavor is nutty with a nice sweet honey chocolate taste and a little coffee bitterness.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Rated base on notes taken 20 Feb 2012 -- This is a very drinkable and flavorful brown. Lots of malt, hint of roast. Greatness.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Bottle. This is a decent brew for getting together with buddies on the weekend. Other than that give it a miss.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;On tap at the World Beer Festival - Columbia on 01/22/2011 (As Red Brick Brown). Clear dark amber body with a small off-white head. Sweet toast and earthy aroma. Light nutty and toffee flavor with some graininess. Medium body with moderate carbonation.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Bottle - Pours a murky brown w/ white head, little retention. There is a light hint of caramel, toffee, and chocolate in the nose. The taste is a bitter chocolate, caramel, and roasted malts. Decent beer
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Pours an orangey dark brown with a frothy white head on top. Has a coppery aftertaste. A decent beer, not my favorite in the brown ale catagory but a decent offering from a smaller brewery.
Red Brick Golden Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Red Brick Brewing Company;12oz bottle Old notes. Poirs a clear golden with a decent white head. Aroma of slight hops. Taste of hops and malt. This light bodied was nothing to write home about.

Red Brick Golden Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Red Brick Brewing Company;Tap at airport. I didn’t catch the Marijuana unfortunately, it only would have served to improve this specimen. Yellow and fizzy. No real Saaz bite. Thin and bland. I suppose if the SE US is a beer wasteland then this is a true outpost. I wish Dogwood were at the airport instead!!!
Red Brick Golden Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Red Brick Brewing Company;I too sampled this at the Atlanta Airport. It is an interesting sample for one reason - a reason I find it humorous that no one has of yet seen fit to writingly observe here on Ratebeer.com. It smells - and tastes - like marijuana. I have never had any beer like this. I would not say it was good - but I was surprised as anything by its druggy aroma and potent, somewhat offensive taste. The beer head [Schaum] did not remain very long, nor was it very thick or creamy like I like it. This was a disappointing but memorable beer. One good thing about it I guess is that it is 5.5%, slightly above average in percentage of alcohol content. The Red Brick Ale is slightly better in taste, but still not very good.
Red Brick Golden Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Red Brick Brewing Company;On tap in the Atlanta Airport. Good honey gold appearance with a poofy head. Very light aroma, what was there was a bit hoppy. I was disappointed with this beer, even though I was looking to sooth my jangled flying nerves. Robustly hopped and somewhat yeast-moldy, moderate sweetness. Body went a bit watery in the end, and the aftertaste didn't hang around. The overall effect of the beer was a bit clumsy.
Red Brick Golden Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Red Brick Brewing Company;Had on tap at their brewpub in Concourse T at the Atlanta Airport. Light golden appearance, nice lacing - had a sweet citrusy honey aroma to it. Bold, crisp flavor for a lager. A little too much carbonation in the finish, however.
Red Brick Golden Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Red Brick Brewing Company;Similar in taste to the Goose Island Pils, that is, very sweet. Some hops but not as much in the tradition of the style as I would have hoped for.

Red Brick American Wheat;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;A very boring and unsatisfying wheat beer. Cloudy and pellucid with no head, and little aroma. Taste is very one-sided, and absolutely nothing to write home about.

Red Brick Winter Brew (2003 and Earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Red Brick Brewing Company;12oz bottle. I’m assuming this one is an ’03 since the photo matches my bottle vs. the picture in the ’04 (and I’ve had the ’04 label too). If they re-did the old lable on the newer bottle, just let me know! Poured a dark brown color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of roast, lots of oatiness, earthy, and a trace of coffee. Tastes of roast, oats, earthy, and chocolate.
Red Brick Winter Brew (2003 and Earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Red Brick Brewing Company;This was actually pretty good. Lots of sweet maltiness, rich chocolate and cocoa, but has an acrid flavor like the tar from the bottom of an ashtray. Light cotton candy spices here and there, and a bit of orange zest. This beer is an absolute trainwreck.

Red Brick Winter Brew (2003 and Earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Red Brick Brewing Company;2002 vintage: Poured a clear dark ruby-brown color with no head. Aroma of smoke, chocolate, cigarette ash, and sweet roasted malt. The flavor was lighter than the aroma. Roasty and tart. A hint of soy and tartness on the finish.
Red Brick Winter Brew (2003 and Earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Red Brick Brewing Company;2002 bottle, courtesy of who else, but kp: Pours a transparent dark mahogany with a thin ring of tan head. Big smoky aroma has some roasted and chocolate maltiness and a hint of tart light fruit. Body starts with a touch of caramel malty sweetness turning more dry and ashy toward a bittersweet dark chocolate finish. Very drinkable and unique, almost like a smoked chocolate porter. This seems like it’s aged pretty well.
Red Brick Winter Brew (2003 and Earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Red Brick Brewing Company;Thanks for this one Wunderbier. I think the aging has probably helped this beer. A weird sweaty sock chocolate aroma. A dark brown/black appearance with a moderate head. The flavor is chocolate, honey, and oatmeal. A bit spicy and overcarbonated. Not bad.
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;"I’m assuming this is the correct one. This bottle has definitely got some age on it, and the label is ""Summer Brew - Unfiltered Wheat Ale"". Pours a milky yellow with ridiculously massive billowing white head, at least 8 inches of head. Nose of banana, bubblegum, and lemon. But pretty weak all around. Flavor definitely has a graininess and metallic tinny finish. Pretty average actually."

Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Had on tap at the Red Brick Tavern in the Atlanta Airport. Pours an extremely cloudy orangeish-yellow with a frothy thick white head that leaves decent lacing. Requisite, sweet bubblegum aroma with a touch of banana. Flavor has the same bubblegum and banana thing going on with a bit of underlying coriander. Nothing really complex, but deent none the less - one of the best I have had from this brewer. Mouthfeel is pleasantly thick but fades just a tad near the end. Good refresher after traveling and fighting through the airport.
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;this was not very good for a summer brew. kinda freaked me out that the label had instructions to make mimosas. weird...... mostly grainy, grassy, outdoorsy flavors and aromas. hints of lemon. not too much flavor and no palate. weird brew... and btw, anyone know if this is retired?? the 6er we got looked like it was 100 years old and i noticed there were 3 ratings from 2004 and then not since 2001

A yellowish orange appearance with some sweaty sock and lemon aroma. The flavor is very odd and sour with some hay, lemons, and whatever funk that was left in the vats from the previous brew. A yeasty and slimy presence exist. The bottle recommends mixing it with 4oz of pineapple or grapefruit juice?? I can see why you would want to. Screw this stuff.
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;THere is nothing all that great and all that bad about this beer. It is fairly light bodied and has a bit of funk in it, possibly due to the extreme old age of the bottles i found. I would have it again for the 4 dolla i payed for the sixer.
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;This is not bad as much as I hate to admit that, as I really do not like the majority of ABC’s beers. This was a nice tangy summer outing. Lots of fresh fruit, balanced acidity, some spicy corriander and orange peel flavors as well. Very clean tasting.
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Large rocky white head with hazy yellow appearance. Aroma of lemon and yeast with a flavor to match. Crisp and refreshing. Nice body with a clean finish. This is better than I thought it would be.
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;They have a ton of this at greens in atlanta now. Cloudy orange pour with a thick, lasting eggshell white head. Wheat and yeast aromas along with a bit of malt when warmed. Nice hopping in the taste, with some citrus (orange), coriander and some peppery spice. I’m going to call it medium bodied, but it’s cutting it close. Nice finish, with some lingering hop bitterness. Nothing to really complain about, it’s pretty solid. Slight sourness keeps it out of the top ten. The best of the red bricks I’ve had yet. Way to go for the locals.
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;Draught at Bayerischer Donisl, Munich. Light hazy yellow coloured, medium sized white head that went away slowly, pleasant estery fruity nose.

Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;Used to drink this back when I would go to the Vortex. Don’t remember caring too much for it. Bland bready maltiness, not a realy clean feeling on the palate, I want to drink something else to get the taste out of my mouth. Finishes with a bit of citrus.
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;I used to drink this stuff when I thought I was cool back in 1998.

Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;Pours a golden color like a typical pilsner. Has a white head. Not much of an aroma or mouth feel. Same with the flavor tasted like a better brewed budwieser but still not good.
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;thanks quiver.

Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;Not sure if I had a bad 6 pack or what.... Was super extreamly carbonated... Poured it into a pint glass... 90% of the glass became the foamy head. I was fairly excited about trying this beer. I would like to try it again, either from the tap or from a different store. I will rerate when I do

Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;a pretty good pilsener. pretty hoppy for a pilsener, and kind of malty. bitter on the finish and a pretty refreshing surprise.
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;Had this one out of the bottle at the halftime cafe. It was actually pretty good contrary to all the shit shag was talkin about ABC. It was an orange hinting on red color with a full malty aroma. I tasted some definite hotness in this, kinda like a red dog, but way better.
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;Nice fresh aroma. Avarage looking pour with average size and quality head. Nice flavor, but the hops flavor was much more American than Bohemian. Nice palate with a good bitter finish. I’d have it again.
Avery Redpoint Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"""for a supposedly british style brewery, this one’s pretty stinkin hoppy. looks unassuming, but between the aroma and the taste, this is a highly enjoyable bitter, floral, grapefruity ipa. well done."""

Avery Redpoint Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Pours ruby red from bottle. Amazing aroma..big hops and. sugars. Aroma does this beers justice, flavir is mice but loses something in way if hops a sweet malts.

Avery Redpoint Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at the brewery in August 2009. Reviewed from notes.

Nose brings forward some amber and caramel malt with a tiny bit of roasted character as well as some light citrus and floral hops.

Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 10-13-2010
Avery Redpoint Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);12 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy amber with a moderate off-white head that lasted through the first quarter of the glass and left partial lace. Mild aroma of malt and really not much else. No hops in the nose at all. The flavor is very malty with a bit of nuts. The malt morphs into a sweet stale malt flavor with some overripe orange. Mild-moderate bitterness at the finish. Not real crazy about this one.
Avery Redpoint Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Pours a cloudy like brown -reddish hue with light head. Aroma, I can’t smell anything. Taste a little watered down, slight hint of the alcohol flavor you get from Imperial IPA(s). Got this beer in a variety case and I have to say so far this is not a good showing for Avery, who makes a delicious I mean breathtaking IPA in the Avery dunga (something like that).

Dark cola brown with light hints of copper. About a half finger of tan head. Nose is nutty and malty but generally pretty faint. Taste is mostly malt forward with a slight sweetness but overall it's a pretty uninteresting effort. Definitely drinkable. Maybe some mild chocolate with nutty undertones.

Avery 14er ESB;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);From Sep 2007 From my notes of July 30, 2007 at Old Chicago on S Colorado Blvd, Denver. It poured from 12oz bottle a clear medium gold with a small head of foam that shrinks quickly to just a ring around the glass. The smell had some hoppy notes as well as some malt. The taste is balanced to a Tee. The initial flavour was grassy but then some grain and the malt moved in almost immediately to make for some very good balance and smoothness. The finish is dry and crisp and there was a long and pleasing aftertaste. I liked it a lot.

A bit of a disappointment."""
Avery 14er ESB;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bottle gift fromSJ. I enjoyed this simple brew. A little thin in the body, but I liked the blend of brown sugar, hop and bitterness.

Surprisingly full mouthfeel and a very dry finish.
Avery 14er ESB;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Aroma of caramel with granite and metal. Hazed amber, not heady. Off-bitter flavor that’s also a bit starchy. Feels heavier at first than on finish, where it dries out. A hill rather than a mountain.

Avery IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Can from Drinks of the World Zürich. No date on can so impossible to see how fresh. Dry, bitter, resinous but lighter than I would have imagined. Nice but not really amazing
Avery IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);For the style, this really isn't that great of an IPA. Balanced off a bit...needs more hops or different malt/hop variety. Semi-clean feel...thinner maybe more like a West-Coast. Not getting much citrus in here. For Avery, I expected a little better. Bottle might have been old though, as I noticed this in a few of the 6-mixpack that I got from Winn-Dixie.
Avery IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Definite hops bite coming through but not a lot else going on. 75 characters can be waayyy too long sometimes. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Avery Old Jubilation Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - English;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bottiglia. All'olfatto si esprimono sentori di fruttato e di sottobosco.

La grandezza delle bollicine è medio-fine. Il colore del liquido è scuro impenetrabile. Il corpo è strutturato. Il dolce è medio in buon equilibrio con l'amaro medio. La forza gustativa è elevata.

Avery New World Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Could be one of the best medium-priced porters that I had that is sold in 6-packs. Actually bought a single of this to try after scouting it a bit. Was in the “clearance” section at Knightly Spirits/Metrowest in Orlando. I asked how old those bottles were, was told about 2 months or so, so for $1.50 I said I’d take my chances. Turned out to be a great experience. Nice hearty aroma of chocolate malts and coffee, with a slight bitterness from the hops. Good dark brown, near black appearance with dark mocha colored head. Smooth semi-creamy taste of chocolate, coffee (but overwhelmingly so like a robust porter). Loved the balance on this one. Can’t wait to buy a 6’er of this!

Avery New World Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bought this from Beer Mongers in Portland, OR 11 months ago. Kind of forgot about it. Dark, black coffee appearance. Small head with little to no lacing. Still fairly carbonated and it retained some of the dry hop aroma. Smells very nice! Lot’s of subdued caramel, maltiness with some cocoa bits in there. Taste is surprisingly dry hoppy still with some licorice and caramel malt sweetness. Pretty tasty. Nice balance with the carbonation. Nice light richness in the mouthfeel with some cool textural quality. Really decent beer I wish I had drank fresh!

Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bottle. Color hazy orange with medium orange head. Aroma hoppy, sweet, malt, some wood. Taste sweet, hoppy, wood, bitter.
Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bottle - pours orange white head - nose/taste of oxidation, booze, earth, caramel - medium bodied
Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Borderline Top 10 barleywine, but solid nonetheless. Has some hop to it....not quite as bitter and citrusy as a DIPA. For 9.2% (lower end of barleywines), would expect to be slightly smoother with less alcohol bite. Nice to try new samples in this style, but tough to beat a good Old Stock.
Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"12-ounce can pours clear copper-amber with a tiny tan head and residual lacing. Aroma: brown sugar, almond butter. Flavor: caramel, caramelized sugar, brown bread, raisins, pine. Mouthfeel: medium- to full-bodied. The bottle says this is an ""imperial IPA,"" but I think it's more like a barley wine, which is what it's listed as on this site."
Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"One of the most beautiful foamy heads I've seen, tan and thick like marshmallows; stays for a while but after a few minutes it mostly disappears. Its high alcohol is upfront since first taste, but it does not overpower others. This is a very bitter beer, but drinkable. It's malty, hoppy, and obviously some pine resin and tropical fruits way back. Wet grass and alcohol once it warms a little. This is a very good beer, not red but caramel in color."
Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bottle at Hopyard, february 10th 2017.Amber brown body with a smalloffwhite head.Aromais boozy with malt,caramel,grapefruit. Taste is sweet and thick,warm,toffee,raspberry, mild toast. Bittersweet warm finish.
Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);A thickly laced off white head on an appealing orange/amber body. Nose has a touch of booze, sweet malt and candied fruit. This is a smooth taste profile. Sweet malt, raspberry jam, citrus hops, and caramel blend together nicely. Slightly slick and sticky mouth feel. A superior, easy drink
Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Pretty beer... medium brown.. some hazy, some head... a touch of reddish color. Great aroma.. clean, somewhat sweet, hops, malty.. touch of citrus. Taste is great.. sweet malt, hops, not much alcohol... clean, palate very balanced for the ABV. Not an all-time great, but a great beer.
Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"Sumptuous. Witty. Unforgiving. Tempting. Wicked. I pour my test beers NOT into snifters, but rather 24oz schupper mugs. I have always loved red IPAs. Those of you touting this as a barley wine, get a new hobby. I had a rough day at work. My wife tells me rhe kids are working tonight, let's have a great meal with great drinks. I respond, ""ok!"" We head to Whole Foods for, what else, dry-aged steaks and some premium beer. After the steaks and beets (yes, we love beets) are in the basket, it's BEER AISLE TIME!! Hmmmm, local beers, sour beers (yukk), i see a pink can with PIGS on the label. This is me!! But, at 12.99 a sixer, i tell my wife I'll go with the old stand-by, and quite a delicious beer, Sam Adams Cherry Wheat (i love cherry anything). My wife STOPS ME IN MY TRACKS. ""If you're going to overspend 9.99 on cherry wheat, you may as well get the pig cans for 12.99!! God, I love my wife!!! At home, my wife has her Chardonnay poured, now it's time for the pigs to squeal. Great pour. Nice deep red/orange. Aroma of deep tropical fruits. This, gentlemen, and ladies, is the epitome of red IPAs everywhere. Tongue-tickling carbonation. Deep piney flavors, but not like you are chewing on pine tree bark! Alcohol is warming, but subtle enough TO LURE YOU INTO A 24 OUNCER!!! This is a MUST TRY red IPA. Please do so and let us know."
Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Can at home. Pours hazy medium amber with pillowy white head. Sharp hoppy aroma with rich malt background. Notes of caramel, toffee, grapefruit. Opens with strong malt profile, which balances well against the resin-y hop bitterness. Malt character is rich and somewhat toasty, with subtle dark, sweet fruit. Full body and luxurious mouthfeel. Very pleasing, warming finish with notes of citrus. All in all, quite excellent.
Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Not. A bad beer for the style or price . Nothing special like their cream ale . Remember both growing up in the 70s and 80s , of course . Nice to see they are still around.
Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can pour. Clear golden with a small white soapy head. Smooth medium body. Light salty flavor with almost no finish.

Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Oct 2018 - 12fl oz can picked up in Denver for $1 and consumed at home in Richmond watching sport, which is what beers like this were designed for. As 'Genesee', no ABV or date. NY's oldest brewery - Est 1878. Branding makes it look like a low-budget supermarket own-brand. Pours a very pale golden, totally clear, lightly sparkling, foamy off-white head leaves full lacing. Aroma is airy, touch of raspberry bubblegum (bizarrely), faint apple. Body is light, rounded with tingly to fizzy carbonation. Taste is metallic water, some salted crackers but mostly tangy metallic sodawater, crisp finish with some odd esters lingering. First impression was quite neutral. Then I hated it. Then over time I warmed to it a little. I guess it's not so bad, but slightly below average for a pale lager. (3-4-4-2-7=2.0)
Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Consumed from can. Very light and watery with that corn vibe similar to the mass produced big brews. While lacking real flavor this would be good for a less filling all day backyard bbq kind of day.
Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours pale yellow with a white head. Very light Aromas of bread and straw, light body and mouthfeel and clean finish
Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Re-introduced to a old friend . I like to make my own choices not be lead by who has the most money for advertising . Genesee Cream Ale imo is as good if not better than ....Coors lite....Bud lite. And at half the price. New York,s Oldest Brewery Founded 1878....140 years in business..The success is in the numbers. On a hot day it hits the spot perfectly . I know this is a sin but I like mine with ice and a twist of lime. Con-grades keep up the good work.........Bear on Beer.
Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can. Pale gold with traces of a white head. Grainy nose with some stale donuts. The taste is pear core along with some green wood. There is a lightly soapu finish with some hints of spice. Not bad for a cheap macro style lager.
Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);24oz can picked up at Lee's Discount in Wendover Pours clear straw yellow with a small white head that dissipates quickly, light lacing. Aroma of sweet corn and straw. Flavor is light, sweet corn and straw Ok
Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Haven't had one of these since my SUNY years. Pale golden colour, larger head that sticks around for a bit before fizzing out. Grainy aroma and taste, somewhat crisp. Corn-like sweetness becomes more prevalent as it warms. Lighter watery body.
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Ar: Light cracker malt; clean; a little sulfur. Ap: Pale gold and clear; small white head with very low retention, settling into a tight ring of foam and a bit of hazy covering. T: Cracker malt with a little bit of biscuit and toast; no sweetness; exceptionally clean; a little herbal, dried-flower flavor; medium-low bitterness; chalk; finish is dry crackers. M: Light body with very high carbonation; finish is very dry. O: A super clean, crisp cream ale; not much more to say."
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);So easily drinkable with good enough fizzy feeling. Has corn sugar or syrup smell but not so big. It’s gentle. Taste good with a bit of lemon juice
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Clear pale golden with a light semisweet aroma. Smells of lager malt and light corn sugar. Smooth clean flavor that’s soft and Lagery crisp. Gently Lagery and pale and softly sweet.
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Some cream corn and pepper on the nose. Medium gold color with a thin white head. Very sweet up front. Sweet corn with some biscuit notes. Bitterness is earthy with some pepper. Kolsch like. Finish is sweet with metallic notes. Average
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can. Light cracker malt aroma. Light cracker malt with a touch of hay and some dry bitterness in the finish. Creamy mouthfeel and medium-light body. Medium-length finish.
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);For 66 cents a beer, I would think cheaper than Bud. This was one offer that I couldn't refuse. Saw this and wanted to try, then saw the price and HAD to try. Decent summer beer. Nothing special. Corn, water, and hops. I also thought this was going to be creamy, but was told that cream ales are actually a version of a Kolsch. The hop finish is nice. This is a light beer and refreshing. Worth the price, but besides that is pretty much forgetable.
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A nice beer to have around when you just want a cheap,regular beer. Nothing fancy. Just smooth and easy drinking. Cheers.
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Another of those underage beers. In 1976 a six pack was $2. This beer is very smooth and reasonably enjoyable. A bit sweet and malty but still a sentimental favorite
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Largely tasteless, slight malt aroma, slight malt/alkaline finish, not much going on tbh, not as smooth or worthwhile as the ice version. Drinkable and cheap (24 oz can, NJ)
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Nostalgia makes you do strange shit sometimes. Well, that and the $13 price tag on a 30-pack from Binny's (slow season... I'm broke!). Drank this for the first time back in like 1985 at an 8th grade party in someone's basement. I lived in Cleveland back then. Moved to Chicago in the mid-90s and hadn't paid it much mind... until it showed up in this part of the country a few years back. Today I said 'fuck it... it's cheap, I'm broke and thirsty' and gave it a go. Yep. Still cheap shitty beer. Even Miller Lite is a marked improvement. Goes down like water though so I'll finish the case. Plus, I hate wasting stuff.
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Water and corn. A little hop at the end which saves this beer, otherwise would be a total bust. On the flatter side carb-wise which give is a smoother feel, but I'd rather have some fizz to it with a beer of this quality. Pretty much a pale lager. Grabbed in the variety pack trying to save a few bucks, but not even worth it.....rather drink water. Why do brewers continue to brew this stuff?
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From old tasting notes. Deep honey gold color with a small bubble carbonation and a large creamy white head. Decent ale-like malt nose with a hint of sour apples. Initially, a sweet ale-like flavor. Zesty midtaste comes across and leads to a bitter hop finish. Tart bittersweet finish.
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Part of a flight at the brewery. It’s pretty much a good macro golden ale..
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Tap at Genesee Brewhouse. Almost nose nose. A bit of grain and fruit. Fruity, sweet flavor with some corn. Pale golden color. Not much happening. Drinkable I guess.
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Poured from a bottle into pint glass Appearance - a golden straw color which formed a large head upon pouring which faded quickly Smell - Sweeter, with no detectable hop aroma Taste - A bit of a corn flavor with not mush hop spice. Sweeter then the traditional ""domestic"" brew. Mouthfeel - Mid range in thickness/viscosity, but with a good amount of carbonation for the style/ Overall - Nothing to outstanding, but decent for its price (picked in a variety 12 pack for $8). For the price probably better then the standard domestic of its class."
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a medium golden with a decent white head. Aroma of grains, corn, and dough. Taste of sweetness and malts. This light to medium bodied brew I snot bad.
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12 Horse Ale is a clear, sparkling, light golden ale with no head-- just a swirl of small bubbles. It has an aroma of sweet malt and corn. It’s medium light bodied with a starchy finish. It tastes sweet and corny. There’s a rubbery, sulfurous funk to it that identifies it as a Genny. There seems to be a slight nuttiness to it. It’s funky and sweet, but I could have more than one in the ice-cold stubby format.
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Tastes like a Macro. Watered Down and Little Taste. Carbonated and sour aftertaste. Must face some tough choices to pick it. Below average.
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12 ounce bottle. cool grenade style/sized bottle. Tastes a bit like Genny Cream but not as sweet. Body is a slightly sweet though. Wouldn’t rush out and buy again
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Bottle to pint. Looks fine; a transparent gold with white head and ample carbonation. Smells and tastes semi-sweet and doughy. Average on the palate. Better than I expected."
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Sweet and malty, some caramel notes. Too thin for the style, not much body. Nothing too complex, a mediocre beer.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From old tasting notes. Translucent medium dark brown color with a foamy tan head. Faint roasted malt nose reminiscent of baked beans. Ligh sweet roasted malt flavor upfront. Middle flattens out and tends to be slightly salty. Finish is toasted mal and light hops. A decent cheap Bock beer.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Aroma and flavor is malts, mild fruit and a relatively clean/mildly sweet finish. Comparing it to craft examples isn’t fair but it was pretty decent.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);On tap at the Taproom on 104. As others have said, it’s probably Genny’s best offering. Tastes like being home.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can. Light brown, whitish head. Some Carmel malts. Easy drinking, but noting special.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Still bordering on mass produced swill, but of the malty non-offensive kind. I’d take a free one but wouldn’t buy one. Same with any Gene.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Another very good beer from genesee.pours a nice red.good flavor.a little bready but not overpowering
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can. Clear golden amber color, thin white head. Aroma of light caramel. Taste is lightly metallic caramel.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);APPEARANCE- dark amber color with slightly beige head. NOSE- earthy & slightly bitter hop scent. FLAVOR- a bit malty with slightly bitter hop flavors. NOTES- May be one of Genesee’s best offerings, but does not stand up well to the bock beer style.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can shared poured cola brown sweet malt and caramel in the nose and the flavor not so good all the way around. I found nothing here drinking sweet caramel water.
Genesee Ice Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Best ice beer ever...smooth crisp and not heavy or bitter like other ice beers.....cheers!!!!
Genesee Ice Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Refrigerated 16 oz. aluminum can poured into a glass.

Genesee Ice Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);4/24/19 (Chicago): $1.16 24 oz can including tax purchased at Shop and Save on 4/19/19, no canning date noted, multiple pours into a pint glass. Light straw clear colour pour, light white head quickly disappates leaving thin white lacing. Sweet corn grain aroma. Light corn and malt taste, too sweet, very thin mouthfeel, slight fizzy carbonation, light drinking. Overall ok offering.
Genesee Ice Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 12/21/2017. Pours crystal clear golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. A bit of fruity corn aromas/flavors, but not overwhelming. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Nicely clean on lager flavors, not too fruity/yeasty. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Minimal warming alcohol for 5.5%. Overall this is good iced pale adjunct lager. All around good robustness of pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/clean/refreshing to drink. Nicely clean and rich pils malt/grains, and mild earthy hop presence/balance. Not too overdone on adjuncts, and not overly sweet. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example."
Genesee Ice Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Very enjoyable beer, nice malt character and creaminess--not very high on the abv but for $1.07/24 oz (€1,30/liter, an almost absurd price by contemporary Estonian standards) it's an absolute steal at this price point. Would have again (24 oz can, Witty's)
Genesee Ice Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Light and thin, watery with a hint of malt, bread, and yeast. Not as bad as some macros.
Genesee Ice Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can. Deep Amber colored body with a fluffy white head that receded quickly. The musky and grainy nose is light. Flavors of apple core and bread crust are present. The finish is sweet and woody. Not bad for a cheap macro.
Genesee Ice Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can. Pours a yellow golden color with a small white head.

Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a deep amber color with a two finger white foamy head. It leaves a decent level of lacing. The aroma had a sweet blend of caramel, toffee, a lighter sweet corn and at the end a roasted malt. The taste was sweet and roasted maltiness over coating an old earthy breadiness. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Overall, not a bad beer, could be construed as a decent budget amber lager. I probably have a few more of these.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Transfer from BA review on 11-7-12- Poured from bottle into pint glass Appearance – Pours a deep amber color with a two finger white head. The head has a great level of retention. Once it fades slowly over time it leaves a decent level of lacing. Smell – The aroma is a sweet blend of caramel, toffee, and a lighter sweet corn smell. Mixed with these aromas are some notes of a roasted malt. Taste – The taste starts out of roasted malt and a caramel sweetness. The roasted malt and some breadiness start out stronger and grow weaker as the taste advances. Unlike the roasted flavors, the sweet grows stronger as the taste advances. The caramel remains somewhat consistent in strength with a toffee flavor growing stronger more toward the middle of the taste. While this occurs, a corn malt flavor grows more and more in strength. In the end a very light earthy hop flavor comes to the tongue, with the sweet flavors this leaves a very odd taste on the tongue. Mouthfeel –The body of the beer is on the thin to average side with a moderate level of carbonation. Not bad for the style and it makes for a rather drinkable brew. Overall – A sweeter style affordable brew. Initially the flavors are quite nice, but the aftertaste is a little off for me (I can’t quite place it). OK, nothing more.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Genny Red is a clear, sparkling, amber lager with a turbulent, white film. It has a pretty fruity aroma with a bit of sweetness and a slight funk. It kind of smells like a hybrid of Genny Cream Ale and Genny Bock. It’s pretty light bodied and pretty smooth. The finish is reasonably clean. The flavor is mostly sweet, fruity malt and a barely detectable, wooden bitterness. There’s a little rubber flavor at the finish, but not much. This is just a swilling beer, really. It has more character than a standard macro, but nothing to offend a standard macro drinker. It really does seem like a mix of their Cream Ale and Bock.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Gorgeous perfect 5 pour. Dark red with a creamy beige head. Absolutely lovely. That’s where the fun stops. Sweet roasted corn aroma is ok. I’d be willing to bet this is Genesee beer or cream ale with coloring added. There just isn’t anything in the flavor to say it’s something different than that. Paid $6.49 for a 12 pack of bottles (Heritage collection). Looks better than it is.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Copper hue with small off white head. Nose of biscuit, cereal, and corn. Taste follows in order with addition of light caramel. Mild bitterness from grass. Light carbonation leads to a silken but thin body.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From the files: toss up whether this or the Cream Ale were the most foul of the Genny line. Red was reddish, maltish, a fine laxative with a minimal amount of alcohol
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours mahogany with a thin off white head. Smells of sweet malt, some caramel, some spicy hints. Tastes sweet and earthy with some tea hints on the finish.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Amber in color with a white head. Light, slightly sweet aroma. Taste is same, with caramel components. Not bad for robot produced industrial beer.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz can-pours a white head and gold with orange color. Aroma is medium/light malt, cream ale. Taste is medium/light malt, cream ale, faint hops. OK/mild carbonation. 3.0 For $11 for 30pk could be 3.2, therefore 3.1
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);College beer that fits the workingman’s budget. It’s a great value, but it’s far too sweet for me now. It’s a fridge filler for sure. I’ll pick the Cream Ale first.
Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From old tasting notes. Amber red color. Small beige head. Slight toasted malt nose. Tasty bittersweet malt palate upfront. Bitter hop finish is overshadowed by excessive carbonation. Long dry aftertaste.
Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Had this back in college a couple time. Sweet reddish brown lager. Some very slight roasted flavors. A little thin. Pretty drinkable. Serving: Bottle
Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Nice looking reddish amber pour in the glass. Nose and taste is little bit lacking though. Rated 6/26/02
Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours copper with a thin tan head. Smells of sweet caramel, some earthy hints, peppery, rosey. Tastes sweet and sticky with some mild bitterness. Refreshing and easy drinking.
Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle. Pours brown with amber hue. Head id moderate. Smells of rich roasted malt, nuts, and caramel. Tastes just a malty, with some notes of honey, roasted malt, some nuttiness, and slight hoppiness. Pretty good, but slightly thin body. Aftertaste is pretty hoppy, but a nice malty sweetness.

Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz - No head, no fizz, overly sweet. A value brew to be sure, and it is rated as such.
Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Crimson pour with a light tan head.

Michael Sheas Black & Tan;Rochester, New York, United States;Stout;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Typical for Americans...take something that requires work (pouring a B&T), and combine it in the same container ""because it’s just as good that way."" Well, this beer proves that theory to be seriously lacking. Weak stout does not equal black and tan."
Michael Sheas Black & Tan;Rochester, New York, United States;Stout;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz - If I’m reaching for a stout this would not be it. Too sweet and no spine. It’s still a standout among macros.
Michael Sheas Black & Tan;Rochester, New York, United States;Stout;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours a medium brown. Light chocolate and a little coffee/caramel aroma. The flavor was rich and sweet. It is an average black and tan.

Michael Sheas Blonde Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Well, I really didn't think this tasted like Bass but I really did enjoy this brew. At just over 5 bucks a 6 pack I thought the value was exceptional.
Michael Sheas Blonde Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A lager that drinks like an ale. Do you like Bass? This is Bass, only less expensive... and more difficult to find.
Michael Sheas Blonde Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);not to bad of a brew i found it alil too sweet for my like but not to bad at all i might try another
Michael Sheas Blonde Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);I have not had one of these in a while since it is no longer available in my area. However, I do remember this being one great beer for those hot summer days.
Michael Sheas Blonde Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A nice body on this Blonde. Very drinkable. Looking back 11 years ago I did not know much about beer then.
Michael Sheas Blonde Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Interesting yeasty, dust aroma with a rare solvent wisp -- heck I just got something reminescent of wormwood. Very drinkable, medium low carbonation but still bright and flavorful.
Michael Sheas Blonde Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A decent brew. I thought it was much too sweet. It was almost like a honey brew. Anyway...fairly good...but needs more hop bitterness or something imho.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From memory. My fraternity’s go-to beer for big parties. Yellow corn nightmare, cheapest beer money could buy.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"(bottle - 40 oz) Found this in the old rating book. Couldn’t believe that I forgot to rate it, but then I read what I wrote and remembered why. Straw yellow pour with a fizzy white head. Standard beer aroma; some hops and grassy notes. Flavor is pretty much beer. Nothing special one way or the other. Bitter and grassy on the finish."
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This really aint terrible. Dont know why some are knocking it. Enjoy a below par ny brew.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"I broke this out this evening lest I have more Imperial Stout ratings than Pale Lager ratings, only to find out its a Blonde Ale, oops it’s already open guess who’s going to buy a single of Chang tomorrow. Pours very clear, and (you guessed it) GOLDEN! There aren’t a lot of fizzy bubbles in this one but there is a really big attractive head, which is something I didn’t really expect. I’m really trying here to pull anything but adjuncts out of the aroma here but my olfactory fails me to do so. It’s not a stinky alcohol ridden corniness of a malt liquor, but kind of like a castrated version of that ol’ fashion malt liquor aroma, corny... kind of sweet... but also boring. The flavor is better than the aroma, it really honestly is, there is an honest snappy hoppiness and not an overbearing flavor of corn or alcohol. This is way drier than it smells, but it’s not without some grainy sweetness, oh and speaking of graininess there is some of that ol’ raw grain character here as well. The palate could be about as watery and boring as it gets, maybe I’d prefer that Golden Anniversary Ice for a more ""full"" mouthfeel. Seriously, I don’t hate this beer, I would pick this above so many other pale lagers. It’s just so damned inoffensive, so boldly flavorless, & so void of character that I feel I must rate it as it is. My sincerest apologies go out to my wife for cracking this so soon. Honey, I just couldn’t keep my hands off this one for another 46 years... guess we’ll have to celebrate our 50th with good beer."
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This is way better than expected. The flavor was smooth and delicious. Awesome for $6.00 at wal-mart in NY.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12 pack purchased for a soft 7 bones. Surprisingly not bad at all. Pours a clear body, aroma and taste are bothb light but somewhat refreshing, not offensive at all.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Picked up a 12 pack at walmart outside Poughkeepsie for 6 bucks. Hell of a deal. Beers not bad either. Reminds me of saporo with slight berry notes.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"It’s better than Coors Light! At least this beer has that going for it. And if given the choice, I’d take this over Coors Light, or Bud Light or just about any of the other products from the big three brewers. But with that being said, this is not a very good beer at all. It’s one that I would picture a frat of college guys drinking several cases of after a football game on a Saturday afternoon &#40especially since it’s only $12 a case!&#41. The beer pours a light yellow color with a big, fluffy and bubbly white head. There was only a very minimal amount of lacing left around the glass, but the head actually stuck around for a little while. The nose is of straw, hay, slight hops and stale bubble gum. The body is extremely light, but somehow smooth and slightly drinkable. The flavors are pretty nonexistent though , with a doughy feel and only slight hints of grassy hops, hay and lightly carbonated water. The finish is a little sour, with more doughy tones, along with some light fruit and light hops. The best attribute about this beer is the value. It’s not a bad tasting brew, and for only $12 a case; if you’re looking to party and get slightly tipsy, this may be the candidate for you. Okay, it doesn’t taste that great."
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Picked this up at the local store and was surprised to see a Great American Beer Festival medal so I was kinda excited to try it. Upon trying it, my enthusiasm has faded. Pours a very clear, pale yellow color with a filmy white head and a LOT of carbonation. Aroma is light grainy, lots of corn, very sweet apple note overall. Flavor has an early corny note that lingers, mild grainy, sweet apple and overall just sweet at the end. Low body, thin texture, lots of carbonation in your mouth. Not a good brew, overly sweet and has a slight harsh corn taste to it that makes you squint after each sip with frustration. Blah.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours gold with a white head. Smells of creamed corn and apples. Tastes sweet and skunky with some stray peppery splashes.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Received in Heritage Collection from late fall. Probably leftover from summer, but ""value"" at $8/12-pack. The variety of beers were pretty weak. This included, although this could be the best of the 3. Pretty much a spiced pale lager....watery, corn, but not too rusty. I wouldn't get again, and would rather have actually had during summer vs. later fall/winter. But, it has been hot....and this has been, well....refreshing."
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Beer has a golden yellow color with a small head. It has a light malt aroma with some wheat. Taste is malty with some grain. Light hint of sweetness. Light beer that is an easy drinker.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Thanks to “cheap” for this brew. I always believed that this is probably one of the most underrated breweries in the country. Hey make good tasting domestic brew at better than your average price for them. I didn’t know this was a re- release, but a good clean, crisp beer. Must drink ice cold. I do like these stubby bottles.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12 oz stubbie from Heritage Collection. Pours a golden color with a decent head that fades to bits of lacing. Aroma of malt sweetness and grain. Very faint hint of hops. Taste of malt sweetness and grain with a bit of citrus way in the background. Mild bitterness and a clean finish. Light body, crisp and a bit refreshing. Easy drinker that goes down easy. best when served cold on a Summer day.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);I actually purchased a case of Genesee Summer Brew in the late 90’s and thought it was decent enought to be a yearly seasonal. Genesee became High Falls and this recipe went into the archives. Same fate that fell onto the two beers in the Heritage Pack. Poured contents of the stubble into an old school Schlitz goblet. I fared better than most raters with a thin head throughout sample of this clear golden pale lager. Slight aroma, light on bitterness, some grain and lemon in aftertaste. Hanging in the backyard with an iced cold Summer Brew it’s hard not to like it.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Pours a pale gold, with a large white head that dissipates quickly. Delivers what it promises, ""lager with a hint of sweetness"". Not as watery as the Fyfe & Drum I just tried, rather this has a creamy mouthfeel - a quality that seems the opposite of what one would look for in a summertime beer. Not very flavorful, but nothing offensive, either."
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Ahh... Now I have tasted the trifecta of the Genesee heritage pack. I present to you the summer brew, in all it’s glory. Pours a clear golden with a head that’s gone instantly. Aroma consists of honey, sweet corn, adjuncts. I have to say, the taste of the first two brews (Fyfe + Drum, 12 Horse) didn’t really exhibit that Genny funk that I have grown use to. This one brings it all home. This brew is loaded with adjuncts, heavy metals, unfiltered water and that good old Rochester, NY shitty quality that some people just can’t get enough of. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people. This is basically regular Genesee beer with a touch of honey to make it even sweeter. No hops present. Is there even any malt in here? I suppose there has to be, although I couldnt pick it out if you held a gun to my head. This beer is bad on so many levels, it’s almost laughably good. So fuck it, I’m giving it a homer score.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);OK, I didn’t just mow the lawn. I pay my kids to do that. But I did clean the deck, wash and wax the car and do some mulching. Then this beer tasted very refreshing. Mild easy to drink Genny with a little lemon? Seemed ok and did the job.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz stubby bottle into a pint glass. Part of the heritage pack. Pours a clear dark yellow with a one finger creamy head. Tons of carbonation and good head retention for a light lager. Smells of sweet corn along with a little bit of bread. Really nothing in the way of hops. The flavor is sweet overall with some corn and cereal grain up front followed by a nice toasted caramel. Bitterness is very light with no hop flavor detectable. Finishes with a slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall I was pretty impressed by this beer. It is slightly reminiscent of Red Stripe but quite a bit cheaper. Very refreshing and plenty of flavor packed into this one. Wish I could buy it on its own.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Ron gave me a bottle of this re-release. I found it enjoyable. But then I just finished a long shift of volunteering at RIT. Fruity nose. Clear and pale. Body bland but clean, with a bit of grainy heft behind it. No off tastes. Really not bad.

Samuel Smiths India Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Samuel Smith;Beautiful lasting foam and a lovely aroma that first makes me think peaches, but on closer attempts to form me a real impression also offers a little caramel and a unique aroma hop that sets expectations high. The taste is barely as hoped as expected and it gives way to a slightly sweet malted taste of caramel and crispy rye biscuits, while the hops are nicely balanced with citrus, peach and maybe I'm completely wrong, but isn't there a little discreet anise towards the end as well? All in all, a very tasty and quite typical IPA which I think is very authentic to the history of the beer type. It is just such a lovely IPA that sets a fine point for a busy work week and which is exciting to enjoy right up until the bottom.

Samuel Smiths Organic / Old Brewery Pale Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Samuel Smith;550ml bottle. Pretty pour of burnt caramel with thick tan head swirling to the meniscus. Aroma is fresh with a faint skunky hop character, roasted malt and hints of dried fruits like plum and figs. First sip delivers more upfront bitterness than I was expecting, but not in a bad way. Good malt and hop balance here with a moderate dry finish. Very little sweetness can be detected past the fruit notes in the nose. Some woody and earthen characteristics, with lots of good quality barley freshness shining through. I've said before that this is not among my favorite styles of beer, and this remains true. However, it's a well crafted recipe and I can't fault Sam Smith's for their commitment to solid quality beer. Probably wouldn't drink again unless my choices were greatly limited, but for what it is, this is refreshing and tasty. Enjoy with smoked meat or a fine gouda cheese.

Samuel Smiths Organic / Old Brewery Pale Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Samuel Smith;Very English in character - that is: bready malt, with a light gun-metal stale astringency (which I personally love), and just a hint of hops (compared to ‘hops’ as we’ve grown accustomed to on West Coast). Blindfolded, I would’ve pegged it as an English ESB. The code on the neck indicated that this bottle originated 9 months ago.

Samuel Smiths Organic Best Ale / Organically Produced Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samuel Smith;From Sep 2007 Purchased at Bi-Rite in Casper for US$3.29 It pours from 550ml bottle a clear gold with a nice thick head of foam that shrinks *very* slowly and ends up as a fine solid layer with good lacing. The second pour gives me a hazy brew and that's fine by me. The smell is a mix of malt sweetness and hop citrus that is light on the nose. The taste has a very good malt flavour up front with some caramel, some bread, a touch of fruit, and some roasted malt.The hops throw in some good citrus notes that help balance the malt and the end result is a very nice, flavourful and very drinkable Pale Ale. The finish is bitter but nice, the mouthfeel is spot on for the style and the carbo is light. Very good stuff!

Samuel Smiths Winter Welcome Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Samuel Smith;"Appearance and aroma weigh this beer down a bit, otherwise is slightly above average. For the style though, average at best. Shocking b/c this is the first beer that didn't quite work for me from Samuel Smith. Flavor is decent, balanced ok. Maybe a tad too sweet with the spices but hop finish cuts it down. More like a spiced ESB versus an ""English Strong Ale"" as listed here. Aroma is subpar, not much with the appearance (a light semi-cloudy brown). On clearance for a buck, so aroma and flavor could be not so fresh. Not really eager to try this again, but worth the dollar for the experience and review."

Flying Fish Abbey Dubbel;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Dubbel;Flying Fish Brewing Company;First sample from Flying Dog. A decent beer, but didn't seem quite like a full representation of a Abbey Dubbel. More like a maibock or regular dobblebock....or something similar to a German beer. Reminded me of Spaten's Optimator actually. Not really feeling the Belgian yeast or fruitiness of an abbey. Still, a good brew with nice caramel malt and hop balance. Ok quality....for the price per 6-pack (about $7.49) and the strength (7.3%), I will probably get a 6 instead of single sample to get a better idea. Curious to try some different styles now from this brewer, as they are starting to be distributed here.
Flying Fish Abbey Dubbel;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Dubbel;Flying Fish Brewing Company;07-May-14 (12-oz bottle: Obtained in trade with slob, thanks Bert!) This beer pours a hazy, brown body with less than half an inch of tan head that settles to a thin rim. Aromas of toasty bread crust, brown sugar, molasses, and dried fruit. Flavors are similar, with a prominent flavors of toasted bread and caramel, plus brown sugar, and dark, dried fruit. The beer is medium-full in weight, medium in carbonation, and though sweet, there's enough toasty character lending some dryness in the finish. Overall, this Dubbel isn't particularly Belgian in character, but it's tasty and enjoyable nonetheless.

Flying Fish ESB Amber Ale;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Flying Fish Brewing Company;"Found this to be something in between an ESB and an Amber. Lacking the ""bitter"" in the ESB...so basically mild on the hops. Clean mouthfeel with fresh hop finish, but the balance is leaning towards the malts (mainly caramel). Light to medium brown-orangish appearance. Making my rounds of sampling Flying Fish....so I'd say this is about average. So far, their Abbey Dubbel is the one that I return to.

T - nice malty taste with fairly even balance of sweet and bitter. More bitter is expected in an ESB but this had a minimal effect on my ratings M - low carbonation; medium body"

The finish is dry with caramel malts closing out the swallow.
Flying Fish Extra Pale Ale;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flying Fish Brewing Company;More like a decent lager or summer ale versus an APA. Overall, the beer is about average....for the style partially below. Cloudy dark yellow to light orange appearance. Flavor lacking hops....sort of refreshing but forgettable. Just started getting into Flying Fish because of the price, but this one is something I will pass on. So far I like their Abbey Dubbel the best.
Flying Fish Extra Pale Ale;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flying Fish Brewing Company;Good, clean lawn mower beer. It's not a session IPA, not a Pilsner, or a hoppy pale ale. It's often a good value and even the lowest priced beer at the store (sometimes $7.99/6 pack). Cheers!

Finger’s worth of white foamy head. Messy lace. The aroma starts off with some sweet orange zest, some lemon peel and then some grassy hops. Caramel and toffee malts play with the balance along with some breadiness. The flavor leans malty sweet with a nice clean taste upon my tongue. Well balanced in the aftertaste and leads well into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine as it is. Overall, good American pale ale that I could come back to if given the chance.

Right away I liked the appearance, deep amber color with a thick, foamy head. A nice amount of lace on the glass too. Aroma is slightly sweet and malty. Lots more than that going on with the flavor, no one characteristic seems to overshadow the other though. Spicy, malty and sweet with just a hint of bitter towards the finish.

Nutfield Auburn Ale;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Nutfield Brewing Company;Bottle purchased from Yankee Spirits in Sturbridge, Mass. Aroma is mildly metallic with a bitch of peppery hops, but quite mild. Interestingly, smelling the bottle after immediately opening it, I get lots of maple sugar in the aroma. I do not know if this was primed with some sort of maple sugar or not, but it does not to be inherent after the beer is poured. Transparent reddish copper color with a large frothy vanilla colored head. Wow, this is extremely carbonated! More carbonated than a brand new soda. Let me try to find some flavors after this inital shock...some roasted caramel notes are pleasant with some metallic flavors. The overcarbonation really fucks this beer up. Big time.

Oily finish on the mouth.
Nutfield Auburn Ale;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Nutfield Brewing Company;This offering from Nutfield pours a reddish-brown that leaves a thin lace in the glass that disappears quickly. The aroma is faint, it has a caramel, nutty, floural hop aroma. As I taste this brew, It has a creamy mouthfeel, with a slightly watered vinous feel on the palate. Again I have to stress the taste is bland, not much going on, the hoppiness I expect is lacking. In the finish is stays with that soft caramel malty sweetness, overall not exciting could have more complexity in the body, as well as there is something about the nutfield brews that give them all the same basic character/finish not a good thing.
Nutfield Auburn Ale;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Nutfield Brewing Company;A hazy orange beer with a lazing beige head. The aroma is sweet with notes of soap, while the flavor is sweet malty with a light hoppy touch in the end. The body is thin.

Nutfield Old Man Ale;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Nutfield Brewing Company;Pours to a clear amber body with a thin white head.

Nutfield Old Man Ale;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Nutfield Brewing Company;Bottled. Poured clear, bright golden with a short cap of whitish head.. nice clarity. The aroma picked up sweet honey, vegetal malts, and a touch of butter with a fresh cut wheat backing.. very syrupy and adjuncty as it warmed up. The flavor found buttery caramel and a touch of molasses at the core, with miscellaneous tacky sweetness extending outward.. grainy sweetness rode out the finish, with a touch of spicy alcohol warmth and fruit. Light-medium bodied and tacky as mentioned on the palate.. rather muddled in complexion.. lots of buttery, residual sugars on the finish.. seemed a bit old, but it was alright.

Nutfield Black 47 Stout;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Dry;Nutfield Brewing Company;I found a bottle for this in an unnumbered box in my cellar recently and lets just say curiosity got the best of me tonight.

Nutfield Black 47 Stout;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Dry;Nutfield Brewing Company;Bottle from strykzone. Thaks Dave! I found this to be a pretty typical dry stout.

I am finding the balance off a bit, but besides that the flavor is OK. A little rusty at first and bitter (not in the best way), but at the end the hops settles in and has a decent bitter-sweet flavor mixed in with the caramel malts. Might also be a little honey in there too. Color is about medium, not dark brown like some other brown ales. I may prefer nut browns over this though, or a Dutch Brown. There are better ones out there in this style.

Sly roaming speckled lace. The aroma had the Fuggles sweet to estery floral/herbal qualities coming across the malts somewhat in an acceptable ""soapy"" fashion.

BridgePort Black Strap Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout - Dry;BridgePort Brewing;Originally reviewed: 8/13/09. Poured into my pint glass, this beer is a shade lighter than deep black. There’s a thin tan head on top that disappears quickly, but it leaves plenty of sticky lacing. Smells of roasted nuts and malts, raisins, and hints of cocoa. The mouth is creamy, but a tad thin for the style. The creaminess carries over to the flavor as well. Big creamy chocolate goodness all over this beer. Finishes roasted and slightly nutty. This is a great standard stout that I will reach for quite often.

BridgePort Black Strap Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout - Dry;BridgePort Brewing;Can’t recall how many times I’ve had this. Time to rate it! Colour... black as night with a thin tan head. Nose... roasted malt, some hops and hints of lactic sourness.

BridgePort Black Strap Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout - Dry;BridgePort Brewing;Thanks to Eric for the bottle.. this one was surprisingly hard to track down! Poured clear (as far as I could tell) deep brown with a short-lived cap of beige head. The aroma picked up a huge dose of the molasses as well as soy sauce, showing a bit of age and light oxidation.. deep and dark.. actually struck me as something of a SATB light. The flavor found dry-roasted molasses, soy, and maple sweetness at the core.. faint vanilla and lactic sourness surrounded.. more of the milky notes and molasses on the finish. Medium-bodied and dry on the palate with a bit of surprising sour character.. not your typical dry stout, and it seemed a little old.. I’d love to try it again.

BridgePort Amber Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;BridgePort Brewing;Going on memory here since it’s been a while, but I remember a deep amber pour with a moderate white head.

BridgePort Amber Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;BridgePort Brewing;Had this ber on 5/27/1998. Color is a deep rich brown with a touch of amber, very good carbonation and nice head. Aroma has is a sweet malt scent with slight hop tones. Taste is earthy and a little woody. It starts off with a medium body with the malt flavors coming threw, then it goes down easy and begins to turn earthy. The finish has what I can only describe as a wood like taste as if it was fermented with tree bark. Is not bad but I prefer an amber that has a good malt taste not the taste of a tree.

Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);One of my favorite beers. I wish they would of kept making this beer. Just had a unique flavor to it. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);I have been looking for this beer for over three years. I remembered having it years ago, and really wanted to re-visit after moving to Kansas City. Needless to say, this was not an easy beer to find, but eventually I found someone with a bottle laying around, so here it goes. Keep in mind that this beer is quite old, likely over 7 years. Pour is hazed orange copper amber with a one inch off white head that falls pretty quick with decent lacing. Looks nice. Aroma is toasty malt initially, followed by a bright citrus cardboard. The initial aroma was nice, actually. The oxidized aroma passes quickly, and benign crystal malt is left behind. Taste is toasty crystal malt, some light sugar sweetness, and only a whisper of cardboard in the finish. This actually tastes in better shape than some English milds I have had in the bottle. The finish gets a bit dirty, and detracts some. Palate is lightly carbonated, with a nice chewy medium body. Despite the really low abv, this didn’t taste watery in the least, and even despite the years, had some nice character.
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours hazy light brown with a thin white head. Aroma is light malt, sour apple, and tea. Flavor is light and fruitty. Would have been a decent session beer and I am sure it would have been better when fresh.
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);One of the first bitters I ever tried...wouldn’t try it again. First...not worth the money for the ABV. Second, the flavor was weak and so was the aroma. It reminded me more of a light american lager than anything else.
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Weak alcohol and taste wise. A hint of citrus. A refreshing beer after to wet the whistle
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);So-so flavor. This is a beer that Boulevard made that could be sold in Kansas grocery stores due to its low alcohol content, and it looks better than it tastes. Not very flavorful, but still better than the macrobrews that you’d get at a supermarket. I don’t know if they even make it anymore.
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Bronze color with a off white head. Light malt and citric hops aromas. Light simple malt flavors with a touch of hopsack. A typical ale.

Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle. Pour was light brown, off white head. Aroma of sweet malt, caramel, roasted malt, spice. Taste was mild bittersweet, malty, caramel, earthy.
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Faithful interpretation of an underwhelming style. Caramel, toast, nuts, and fresh wheat bread lead to a mild floral bitterness on the back end and a dry, doughy fade. Inoffensive, but not terribly interesting. A good background beer, I guess, when you don't give a shit what you're drinking as long as it isn't utter swill. Gorgeous red-brown color, though.
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Smell is like a scotch ale. Color is brown with a red tint. Taste is Amber, Woody, hops, some bitterness and refreshing clean finish. Not normally what I go for but like it.
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle. Caramel malt aroma with notes of roasted malt, earthy hops and toasted malt. Pours a lovely shade of dark red with one finger of reddish-white head that has excellent retention but no lacing. Starts with nice caramel and toasted malt flavors. Finishes with roasted malt and bitter earthy hop flavors. Pretty nice Irish red.
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);12floz bottle, BBD: 07.16.2018, $7/six-pack, pint glass. A fine looking red ale, where there's a one finger head on the pour and good retention. Smells of bready caramel goodness, and taste is very toast like (a touch of roasted malt with a hint of butter noted). There is an astringency that holds this beer rating back, which at one time I considered this to be good beer in general and not just to the style. It's still pretty good for the style as it accomplishes much o what is desired, but the lingering tinny taste is bothersome. My prior fondness for this beer may be biasing my score a bit high.
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Good smooth Irish ale. 30 IBU makes it a tiny bit more bitter than some ales. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);From Jun2007 Purchased at Liquor Shed in Casper This ours from 12oz bottle(best by May 1 2007) a nice clear amber with a smallish head of foam that shrinks pretty quickly to some spotting near the edge of the glass with some lacing. The smell has some sweet and roasted malt to it and it's nice. The taste isn't as sweet as the nose would indicate and that's fine by me. This has a good roastiness to it with some sweet notes and some fruity hop goodness there as well that shows up mostly in the finish. Nice long lasting aftertaste that is very yummy. A very smooth yet tasty drinker...I've had this many times before and I was surprised to find that I hadn't reviewed it yet. I think this is a top notch example of the style and I *believe*, my favourite to date. Very well done, Boulevard!

Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Short stubby bottle like the one pictured but the label is different, it says red ale prominently. Big malty aroma that follows a milder malty nose. First taste is aged ale like. Decent co2, but yes this is quite like an irish ale of the old country, I think. Difficult, does not hide its abv attribute, its there, get used to it. Reddish? Not too sure, its more like orange brown yellow, 314. Whew. Becomes a little difficult in the end, but it is beer.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);9/17/19 - Maumelle, Ar - Lake Liquor - 12 oz bottle. Bright orange appearance with a light off-white head. Sweet, malty aroma with some cotton candy sugary notes. The flavor has some of the same sweet accents with a little bit of nuttiness in there as well to round it out nicely. No fading to vegetable -like drabness in this like some Marzens tend to do . One of the better domestic Oktoberfests that I have had in a while.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);My favorite Oktoberfest beer. Smooth and satisfying. It is only available for a limited time so pick up a 6 and try it.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);B. Pours a clear Amber color with white head. Aroma is fruity with smoked berry character. Highly drinkable
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);From May 2008 I had a bottle of this at Old Chicago last night. Nice clear amber red pour with a very small head of foam that disappeared completely within a couple of minutes. The nose had a nice strongish bready and caramel malt smell with a noticeable fruity note and just a bit of hoppiness hiding in the background. I really liked taking whiffs of this one! Nice caramel and bready malt flavour with some fruitiness and a fairly dry finish thanks to a small but, it is there, hop presence. Wow. The more I drank, the more I wanted to drink...extremely drinkable for me(mouthfeel was nice and not a bit watery) and very satisfying. I just wish I could buy some sixers around town. :^(
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours amber with minimal head. Aroma is fruity with smoked berry character. Flavor is crisp and smooth. Highly drinkable.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Smells rich and malty with spicy hops. See through amber color with a pale white head. Sweet but not overdone with a crisp and earthy hop bite. This is a good representation of the style.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours a light, clear copper color with white head. Bready malty aroma. Moderately sweet, bready, malty, slightly earthy. A nice fest bier. Notes: Bottle from Cosentinos, Oct '17
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Solid marzen, malty but brisk, offering up deep caramel and nutty flavors while keeping mild apple esters and a moderate noble hop bite on the back end. Never quite reaches the malt depths you want it to, but it also refrains from growing cloy, and the floral hoppiness makes for a bright, clean finish. Decent festbier nose, and the pour is a lovely orange-red with a slight head and modest lace. Sparkly texture with a hint of oily clinginess. Not bad.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Draft @ Boulevard Brewpub (KC Airport) - Pours deep orange brown, clear. I'm getting mild caramel notes, some bitter dryness. Meh.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Stylistically, it was just a little sweet, but this is one of the better Oktoberfests I have ever had and I love the American interpretation of the style. It had a rich maltiness but was well balanced by the hops.
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle pour into shaker pint glass from Total Wine & More, Danvers. Appearance is lightly hazy (lots of fine particulates in suspension) red-dark amber with trace sparkle, finger-width creamy beige head with excellent retention and decent soapy lacing. Aroma is pumpernickel bread. Taste follows aroma but less intense. Mouthfeel is medium side of light-to-medium bodied with smooth, creamy texture, average-to-lively carbonation and dry, fairly crisp finish as taste. Overall, pretty much a one-trick pony. No complexity but it is pretty comforting.
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours clear, dark copper with a three finger, beige head. Aroma is molasses, hops and light spice. Taste is light brown sugar, moving to light nutmeg and hops. Finish is hops and light nutmeg.
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);12 oz bottle. Pour a beautiful mahogany with an off-white tight persistent head. Scents of malt and some spice. Tastes of malt and spice with above average carbonation. Really nice seasonal
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle purchased at Hy-Vee. Pour was dark amber, foamy off white head. Aroma of caramel, convoluted spices. Taste was mild sweet, malt, caramel, toffee, fruit zest, nut.
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);"It's weird that as I review this I have been wanting to try this for years. Actually found a single of it one time but it was too much a hassle to price check it. Alas. A few years later and I found a single of it; I'm glad I didn't fully commit to a 12 pack of it. Not much to say that hasn't already been said. It has a piney scent. A flat citrus taste. It has a nice lace but other than that it's all booze. And that's ok. If your at a party and your choices are Natural Light or this choose wisely. In my opinion most of the Christmas beers miss the point. They always seem to please too many people. Or are too ironic. I feel like with this one it either needs to have more hops or be more closely related to an ale. It seems closer to a pale ale with a cloying after taste. I do like the bottle design if that can be the only positive."
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours orange with a beige head, aroma of orange toffee and caramel, flavor orange and toffee, caramel notes, pretty alcoholic with medium body
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);12 ounce bottle from the remainder shelf at Liberty Beer in Pittsburgh. Just pretty much average in all categories. Not very remarkable.
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);bottle. Poured opaque reddish amber with a beige head. Fruity tart aroma. Medium body, prickly carbonation, lingering astringent mouthfeel. Flavour of toasted malts, a bit woody, spicy notes with a warming finish
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a cloudy orange-caramel color with an enormous fluffy orange-tan head that lingered and left decent lacing. The aroma was malty with a hint of baking spices. The flavor was very bitter and astringent with notes of malt and dry spices. Long finish. Medium body. Not good.
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Draught. Pours copper with a moderate beige head. Aroma is caramel, toast, nuts, clove, and more spice. Taste is nuts, bread, toffee, fruit (berries?), spice (especially nutmeg), and pepper. Decent bitterness. Light-medium body. High carbonation. Oily mouthfeel - a touch sticky.
Stone City Hefeweizen;Solon, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stone City Brewing;A little citrus and grain. However, lacking a little as most of the Stone beers. Not much to it.
Stone City Hefeweizen;Solon, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stone City Brewing;Stone City hefeweizen is on a par with the great wheat beers and was quite a good local beer. Very enjoyable to drink.
Stone City Hefeweizen;Solon, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stone City Brewing;A very nice thirst-quenching hefe. Good clove-banana aroma. Especially good on tap fresh at the brewery
Stone City Hefeweizen;Solon, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stone City Brewing;How to describe it . . . flavorful, yet gritty. Unfiltered wheat beer or no, it's got a vague sandy consistency, but it's extremely refreshing and, if you're in Eastern Iowa, it's a darn good local brew that's reasonably readily available. Nice citrusy hints, decent body--not bad at all.
Stone City Hefeweizen;Solon, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stone City Brewing;I love this kind of beer. It seems to be the only thing apart from a Corona type beer that I can handle.
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;I really liked this particular version of an IPA. Very unique flavor, for an ipa that is. Used to be one of my favorites
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;You can't get this anymore, but a friend of mine had some left over from last year. I can't say that age improved the brew. Tasted about the same as I remember it tasting when it was a staple beer of mine. I can't believe I used to think this was good. It's bland and boring. I hate to disparage the hometown team, but guys, this was not a hit!
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;Not that impressed. As usual, Stone City creates a fairly sub-standard beer for the locals. The ale is weak and has plenty of yeast for those who like bottled ales.
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;Clear bronze color with a thin coating of white, semi-lacing head. Aroma of sour malt and bittering hops. Body is much the same, crisp, but bland and uninteresting. Reminds me somewhat of Sam Adams Lager.
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;Pour produced a thick, white & frothy head. Deep amber color. Peculiar aroma (airplane glue?). Flavor was bitter at first, then the Kent Goldings were apparent. Decent beer, hard to get past the aroma.
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;"I am open to the possibily I had a BAD BOTTLE but I don't have enough experience with ales to be sure. I thought it was awful and poured it. Appearance was disgusting; aroma, flavor and mouthfeel not much better. I promise to re-rate if I can find more."
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;The color of pennies glistening in a subtle light, with a thick and foamy head that diminishes. The hops aroma entices the senses, while the thick, full mouth produces a sense of heaviness. The fruity, hops taste compares well to Alpha King.
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;Hazy amber color with a smallish light tan colored head. Aroma is quite fruity sweet/sour and floral. Flavor much better than the aroma. Mild caramel malt flavor with a touch of sourness. Mild hops flavor. A bit thin in mouthfeel. Finish is rather nondiscript.
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;Crisp with nice hop bite and finish. There is however a flavor in the yeast profile that I do not enjoy.
Stone City Artist Colony Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Stone City Brewing;I used to grab this when I was missing my German alt. I think this might still be available from the brewery in larger bottles but I haven't seen it on the store shelves in a few months. This bottle was worth hanging on to for quasi sentimental reasons, and I'm glad I didn't pour it down the drain, but I'm not going to miss it, either.
Stone City Artist Colony Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Stone City Brewing;Has a skunky flavor. It appears to suffer from quality control as do all of the Artist colony beers I have tried. Too much acidic and yeast taste.
Stone City Artist Colony Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Stone City Brewing;I saw the rating directly onder mine and was almost scarred off, but this is a darn good beer. I wouldn't rate it as a top beer, but it's a nice sip while I surf the net.
Stone City Artist Colony Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Stone City Brewing;Cloudy brown with a decent beige head. Sour dough with a touch of roasted malt aroma. Very thin feel with a acidic malt flavor and finish. A dry brown ale that seems to be fermented out with an off yeast. Dry and acidic.
Stone City Artist Colony Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Stone City Brewing;A little confused in the finish. Decent looking pint, just some background sourness that is a bit off putting. I usually only have one per session, as the sour finish becomes too much after a couple of them. Still I like to support my local.
Stone City Stein Bock;Solon, Iowa, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stone City Brewing;BASED ON NOTES from about two years ago, when I first had this (so take this for what it's worth). The brewery, I'm told, has since gone out of business. For the quality of beer these guys were making, I always thought the six packs were overpriced, but I'm no marketing expert. Packaging and reputation made me think I was getting a primo craft brew, but it was really pretty ordinary (though not terrible) craft brew. Here goes: Sweet and fruity, but not as full feeling (body, mouthfeel) as other bocks I've tried. It's like a bock trying to be something else. Too much sweetness and not enough crispness from hops.
Stone City Stein Bock;Solon, Iowa, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stone City Brewing;Overly sweet in both the start and the finish. Lacking in the smoothness and cleanliness that for me makes bocks good. Kind of clumsy and too fruity.
Stone City Stone Bluff Pilsener;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stone City Brewing;Not a good pilsener at all. Cloudy, looked more like a hefe-weizen than a pils. I mean, c'mon, a pilsener is supposed to be crystal clear. Great head though, lasted the whole beer, rings for every sip. Taste was good, but not really like a pilsener should taste. All in all it was a good beer just to drink but a very poor example of the style.
Stone City Stone Bluff Pilsener;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stone City Brewing;Cloudy, dirty straw color with a moderate off white head. Citric, sour, vinegar aroma. Initial flavor of sweet malt that goes to a orange and lemon sourness. Fairly dry in the finish with a slight graininess. Not much of a pils. Would rate slightly higher as a kolsch or cream ale, albeit not much.
Stone City Stone Bluff Pilsener;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stone City Brewing;Fermented way too warm to be a good true pilsener. Quite fruity and lacking in the crispness and cleanliness departments.
Stone City Stone Mansion Stout;Solon, Iowa, United States;Stout;Stone City Brewing;Brown highlights, quickly dissipating head. Roasty aromas. Bitter, roasty flavors. Bitter, dryish finish. Over-carbed and a little lacking in mouthfeel for an oatmeal stout. One dimensional.
Stone City Stone Mansion Stout;Solon, Iowa, United States;Stout;Stone City Brewing;Nearly balck with a thin light tan head. Dark malt, grass, hay and urine aroma. Sweet roasted flavor with a fairly creamy feel. A touch aserbic. A sweet oatmeal stout.
Stone City Stone Mansion Stout;Solon, Iowa, United States;Stout;Stone City Brewing;This was very pleasant. Rich stout with a creamy mouthfeel. Much more choclatey than it is roasty, but still feels more like a stout than a porter. Finishes with a singular blast of roasty malt and cascade? hop blast. Quite well done.
Stone City Stone Mansion Stout;Solon, Iowa, United States;Stout;Stone City Brewing;Thin and brittle, with dry roast malt flavours and little else. ...........
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Portland Brewing Company, Inc. Woodstock IPA 1998 12 oz.

MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours amber and hazy with a white head. Smells of sweet caramel, citrus, oaky. Tastes dry and uninspired with a sweet citrussy finish and lots of bitterness hanging around.
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle. Poured a hazy brown body with thin head. Aroma is hops, some wood. Flavor is malty, lightly bitter hoppiness and some oak. Odd bitterness to it.
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12 oz. bottle pours an amber colored fluid with a slight white head. Smell is woody, with smoked malts, and a subtle hop aroma. Medium bodied with a rich, creamy mouthfeel. Taste has a strong malt presence followed by a tasty hop bitterness. A unique taste here, definately not your typical West Coast IPA. nov 2004.... 2007 update : with all the barrel aged beers nowdays, how come there’s not more aged IPA or DIPA’s out there? Because this beer wasn’t a huge success doesn’t mean the style is not suited to aging, does it ?
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Had this beer on 3/20/1999 when it was known as Woodstock IPA. Color is a deep gold with a touch of brown, carbonation is good but head seems a bit thin. Aroma is a lightly sweet malt scent. Taste is very oakey, reminds me of Jack Daniel’s. It starts with a medium body as it goes down and oak taste begins. The finish begins with the oak flavor taking on a sharpness and some mild bitterness comes through. Overall the oak makes for a little too sharp of a bite for me but I think this is what they wanted it to be like. It’s probably a good beer for when you feel like having a Whiskey but don’t want to drink hard alcohol.
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);An enjoyable IPA with a good character, although for me not one that stands out in any way either. If I could buy this beer regularly, I might drink it occasionally as a table beer but do not consider it one to seek out as a special one.
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle @ Oliver Twist, Stockholm. Pours a clear amber color with a small off-white head. Sweet malty slightly hoppy aroma. Sweet malty hoppy flavor with some oak hints and hints of grapefruit. Sweet malty finish with a hoppy bitter aftertaste.
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);(Bottle, Oliver Twist, Stockholm) Amber colour with brief white head. Fruity, hoppy nose with notes of rubber, oak and dried fruit. Fruity taste with balanced notes of hops, dried fruit, wood, vanilla and rubber. Rather sweet. Tasty and nice, well balanced. But can’t help feeling something is missing (some dry hopping?).
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Poured a clear copper color with a small head that dissapated to a thin cap. The nose was of orange and grapefruit meat along with some grassy notes. The taste started with a nice balance of light malt, yeasty fruit, and citrusy/sprucy hops. Notes of oak, vanilla, toasty breads and caramel malts appear in the end; followed by a solid bitterness in the finish that rise up to leave it dry and refreshing. This isn’t a text book IPA, but it is really good, reasonably complex, and very easy to drink. You can’t ask for more than that... can you?"
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A cloudy copper color with an off white head that laces nicely. A kind of citrus like aroma. Dry taste with a hint of citrus, lemon I think. Pretty good.
MacTarnahans Oregon Honey Beer;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A nice solid beer with only hints of honey in both aroma and taste. It brings a slight tart flavor but finishes well.
MacTarnahans Oregon Honey Beer;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle at Craig’s. Pours pale yellow with no head. Aromas of light honey, soap. Taste is thin, lemon, honey. Thin body. Sweet finish.
MacTarnahans Oregon Honey Beer;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Eh...... it was not that great. Really just a middle of the pack beer. 2.5/5, C-. August 7th, 2014.
MacTarnahans Oregon Honey Beer;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pale clear bright golden, bubbly sheeth. Faint lemon and thin malt. Soapy carbonation and a fading tinny bitterness. Sweetness is fairly diluted and generally a bit sickly. Bottle, Tasting by Numbers Tasting
MacTarnahans Oregon Honey Beer;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle at Craig’s. Pours golden, nose is light honey and toffee, taste is dull toffee, sweet.

MacTarnahans Oregon Honey Beer;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);On tap at the Portland Brewing brewpub. Pours a clear golden color with a medium white head. A light floral nose, meaty almost. Grainy, a bit of sweetness, frankly pretty dry and grainy, husks, a mellow body. OK.
MacTarnahans Oregon Honey Beer;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle from the local Costco. Pours a clear dark golden color with a fairly thick white head on it. Nose isn’t all that appealing - I get just a light bit of sand and wheat to it, and little else. Tastes light and slightly sweet. Not bad, but nothing special.
MacTarnahans Oregon Honey Beer;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This beer is absolutely delicious in the bottle, and even better if you can find it on draft. Very highly recommended.
MacTarnahans Oregon Honey Beer;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);bottle. hey it tastes like honey! kind of fruity too. not something I’d want to drink a lot of.
MacTarnahans Amber Ale (Macs Ale);Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);I love red ales and Portland brewing serves up another winner. Too me, a red or amber ale needs a strong slightly sweet malt balance to the ubiquitous northwest hops and this stuff is right on the money. Pours from a bomber bought in gresham Oregon as an almost cloudy deep amber color with nice head. I absolutely love the toning down of the hops. It is an amber you know! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
MacTarnahans Amber Ale (Macs Ale);Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);My very first Oregonian beer in Oregon, and not a bad start--love the appearance, love the caramel, though obviously it's too hoppy for this user. Still, balanced and drinkable (22 oz bottle, Shell, Portland--near PDX)

MacTarnahans Amber Ale (Macs Ale);Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);On tap at Portland Brewing, pours a clear golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out dry bready malt and very light restrained hopping. Flavour is identical, very clean and easy-drinking, but uninspiring. Bready malt, a touch of caramel and light hop resins. Decently made.
MacTarnahans Amber Ale (Macs Ale);Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);22 oz bottle in Oregon.

Portland Brewing Haystack Black Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Miss this one, was one of the best offerings from the Portland/Pyramid/MacTarnahan’s conglomeration. Smooth mouth, light chocolate and coffee with a small earthy hop bent. Solid offering in all ways.
Portland Brewing Haystack Black Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This is one of my favorite Microbrews. It has a unique flavor with a nice finish. It doesn’t overpower the palate, nor does it linger for a long period of time. If you’re a dark beer lover pick up a Haystack Black and give it a go. Note: If you find a bottle in a basement...best to leave it and go buy one fresh.

Portland Brewing Haystack Black Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours a nice brownish black color. Aromas of espresso, chocolate, and a hint of bitter smoke. Flavor has a burnt chocolate/coffee taste to it, just a touch of hops coming in at the end. Damn fine porter.
Portland Brewing Haystack Black Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A very good offering from these guys. Pours very dark, with a nice foamy head. Aroma is slightly chocolate, but not overly so. Flavor is a little more mellow than I expected, but still shows a lot of malt and body. Very thick mouthfeel, fairly creamy. Good stuff.
Portland Brewing Haystack Black Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bought in June 2004, California.Sampled on the 3rd Jan. 2005. Deep black porter with thick dissipating moka head. Milk chocolate in aroma with a nice powdery sweet cocoa in mouth, and a nice smoked peat in finish. The hops are long gone from this beer. Very short in mouth.
Newcastle Brown Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Farve: mørk brun farve med lidt cremet skum. Aroma: søde karamelnoter Smag: medium fylde med noter af karamel og toffee. Mild floral humle.
Newcastle Brown Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;John Smiths (Heineken UK);"550ml bottle brewed in England at 4.7%. Dark brown, slight metallic orange with the light going through it. Good-sized so-so lasting head. Sweet, somewhat complex yet oddly stereotypical-feeling toffee malt aroma - hints of dandelion & burdock. Low carbonation. Mild grassy hops and then toffee malt and biscuit malt and even some roasted malt take centre stage for the duration. Possibly one-dimensional but plays around within that dimension a fair bit. Sweet and absolutely malt-forward, in parts refreshing, maybe even slightly watery, but mostly cloying. Really not bad, though, and very fun to compare and contrast this with the similar style of a German dunkel! Not necessarily a fair comparison though; you might want to find a better representative for the brown ale style - this is very noticeably commercialised on the palate, even if it is easy drinking (that's Heineken for you). I might call this a ""radio beer"" - it's a bit like those songs you like on the radio that you always tune in quick and turn the volume up to listen to, but only because they're much better than the standard radio fare - you'd very rarely if at all actually go and put them on if you happened to be in control of what music was playing. This beer serves as a good sign of what ale drinkers look for in their beer that lager doesn't have - have one of these and a typical bottled lager side by side and the fundamental nature of the difference in the two styles should quickly become apparent."

Newcastle Brown Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;John Smiths (Heineken UK);A light reddish brown colour with an off white head of a fair formation and retention. Clear enough to see through it. Aroma is mild overall, bringing caramel, light toffee, subtle nutty perception. The flavours are also mild following the aroma, with a slightly roasted aftertaste. Medium light body and medium carb. Hop perception is subdued by malts. Finishes medium sweet to dry. Although the beer is a reference to the style, the style itself lacks character.

Newcastle Brown Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;John Smiths (Heineken UK);The nose has caramel and a light hint of nuts and malts. Taste is a bit boring, don’t get me wrong, it’s drinkable but it has a regular beer-taste and nothing else.
Bass Pale Ale (USA and export);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);A very historical beer, but the quality didn't quite match. Lack of richness from the malt makes it a little watery. I definitely will have London Pride or ESB rather than this next time.

Bass Pale Ale (USA and export);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"Bottle from Tesco. Pours a thin white head with mediocre retention. Clear and lightly sparkling body. Copper amber colour. Nose is very much of the classic ""British beer"" and definitely has what I identify as the Bass characteristic. Also candied fruit, hops and malt. Also hard water, a hint of sulphur and maybe hop extract. Taste is bitter with some metallic notes. Lightly carbonated mouthfeel. Dry finish. Body is a little thin, but with a full mouthfeel somehow. Overall a good classic English bitter, and very much an atypical example of the style."

Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Bottled (BBE 2003, from old bottle collection). Golden colour, small white head.

Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;A bit stale after sitting in the cellar for six years but tonight with dinner it was quite good considering. I had forgotten about it since my trip there in late 2000 and just had it stashed away in a box of brewing equip in the basement. Still quite nice in the glass with thin carbonation. Not as much passion fruit as I remember but nice with rice and chicken. I hope they bring this one back.
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;A light golden yellow beer with a thickish head. An extremely fruity aroma of mangoes and passionfruits, and a hint of roses. The taste is distinctive, exotic fruits, again mangoes and passionfruits, as well as sweetened bananas, with a slight bitterness in the finish. (Bottle).
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Bottle 28/06/2004 Clear golden coloured with pale, fruit and hoppy aromas. Orange flavour. Crisp lasting malt finish.
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;(Bottle 50 cl) Pretty, golden beer presented in a clear glass bottle - decent head. Strong, floral hoppy aroma. Flavours are dominated by perfumy passion fruit (really hope it’s natural flavours), but the fruity sweetness that would be expected never surface. Instead you get a very light and dry beer - not much bitterness though. I reckon this would work as a summer quencher, it’s just not the worlds most harmonious brew. 260402
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Bottled. Bright golden, Aroma of peach and passion fruit. Juicy peaches atop sweet dense malt, balanced by some grassy hops. This is a fruit beer that works, at least to some extent.
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Bottle. Very pale gold. Elderflower, passion fruit, Irn Bru, metal, carbonation aroma - all a little prickly. Medium to light bodied. Neutral palate. Pretty much the same all the way through, just like a cheap lager. Cheap lager with a splash more character.
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;No doubt the clear bottle is intended to show off the colour, but I can't help think it looks like piss. Passion fruit eh? Tastes like flat lager with some sort of tropical fruit extract concentrate. One of Youngs least impressive efforts. I should say, however, that (with the exception of a good sour kreik) I have never really had a fruit flavoured beer that I have enjoyed, so others might find it more to their taste. Syrian hops? That's a new one on me. Bottled (500ml)
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Bottled. Clear bright yellow body with a fine white head. Fruity aroma, accurately reflecting the passionfruit infusion. Acidic, fruity, citrus flavour. Moderate bitterness with a medium palate.

Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;500 ml bottle. Amber coloured with a hint of haziness, probably because it is past its best before date. Small white head. Sharp citrus hoppy edge with an acidic twang. Somewhat thin-bodied. Something has happened to it as it is off. Thin and sharp hop acidicity. Has seemingly been a light refreshing bitter in its youth.
Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Small white head. Amber body with a slight haze. Mild nutty hop aroma with something funny in the background kind of like gasoline (may be because the beer is 9 months past the sell-by date). Taste is watery chalky paper and bitterness. It must be too old, so I’m rating it a bit leniently, given that I’ll probably never be able to re-rate. This probably was a nice bitter when they bottled it. (0.5l bottle, thanks to Knut Albert.)
Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;looks good, lightbrown with a thin head. smells citrussy. taste: citrus(grapefruit, lemon), bit of caramel and a bit bitter. a bit too thin body, but very drinkable.

Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Had a bottle last year and wasn’t overly impressed. This time I quite enjoyed it: it’s a light, straightforward, uncomplicated beer for drinking quickly when you’ve got a thirst rather than savouring slowly. It looked good, had an acceptable bitterness, and the sour taste was agreeable enough
Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Bottle from sainsbury.

Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Typical pasteurised English summer session ale. Amber colour, short diminishing head.

Young's Double Chocolate Stout;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);"This beer really remind me the famous ""Fuller's Porter"" that also is from ""England"". This perhaps has little more chocolate and coffe inside but also it is more bitter and has less sweetness inside.. And more carbonation that is good. The first mouthfeel is slightly bitter that i'm not fan for that but the aftertaste is amazing.. The aftertaste is endless and you feel very good chocolate and coffe taste in your mouth.. Really one of the best aftertaste i have get from one beer.. Overall is a decent and refreshing beer to drink any season you want.. ""Stout"" beers is not my style but this one is really a very good beer despite the style."

Opaque dark chestnut, a brief fluffy head, medium lacing but no visible rising carbonation. On the nose, vanilla, chocolate custard, hints of coconut and crushed nuts. In the mouth, softly smooth and creamy, thick rich milky texture, mild bitterness with a touch of clean sour dryness, flavours of chocolate, vanilla, burnt caramel with a long mildly dry finish.

Aroma of chocolate, roast malts, nuts. Taste of dark chocolate, nuts, roast malts, the chocolate is fairly light in intensity, almost underwhelming, bittersweet, the finish is bitter and ever so slightly metallic. Medium bodied, smooth, very nice for the ABV. It's not doing much for me really, guess I've been spoiled by craft beer in the past few years as this is lacklustre in comparison, I'm sure it was fantastic back in the day though.

The beer has weak aroma of toasted bread…some zest or very delicate lemon grass ? Maybe herbs, anyway the beer almost has no complexity. The same with the taste. One thing which is nice , it’s the fancy packaging. That made me buy it.
Youngs Extra Light;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Young's;Bottled. An amber coloured beer which looks flat in the glass. There is a little nuttiness to the predomainantly cardboard accented aroma. The taste is sweet with caramel notes. Thin as expected but not awful.
Youngs Extra Light;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Young's;"Largish shiny offwhite creamy head. Brown body with carbonation. (Strange for a low alcohol.)

Youngs Extra Light;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Young's;Yippee. Low alcohol ticked off my list of beer styles without having to resort to one of those ghastly low alcohol lagers. That’s the good news. The bad news is the beer itself. As others have said its all old dull malt and not much else. No hops to speak of. Thank God we were sharing and I didn’t have to drink the whole thing myself. And I see now that I marked it higher than the others - must be getting overgenerous. Bottled at Youngs Brewery Tap, February 2005.

Young's Old Nick;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);"""smooth, malty, and sweet, but thin and boring compared to the best of this style. still better than an average beer, but subpar for a barleywine. needs to be more complex (compelling?)"""

Deep amber color, good clarity with a smooth white head. Doughy malts, fruity and a soft citrus hop character.

Maritime Pacific Salmon Bay Bitter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Maritime Pacific Brewing Co.;Nitro pour at Maritime in Seattle. Deep copper color, fluffy head with perfect lacing. Just a bit sweeter than the typical ESB. The hops swept evenly along the tongue however, balancing out the maltiness rather well.

Oldenberg Premium Verum;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Oldenberg Brewing Company;I guess this was a pilsner as that's how its listed. I tend not to like pilsners simply because they are slight. This is pretty much the same. Slight. Watery. Slight hops. Light in color. I enjoyed it while I drank it because it was beautiful day and I was completely relaxed at the time. So it hit the spot but not because of the flavor.
Oldenberg Premium Verum;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Oldenberg Brewing Company;A decent beer, good hops and malt nose and flavor, a strong beer, not suited for everyone.

Oldenberg Raspberry Wheat;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Oldenberg Brewing Company;An excellent fruity beer and a nice change of pace. This beer could stand alone fairly well as a wheat. The raspberry flavor is perfect, neither watered down nor syrupy. Smooth and drinkable, with a little bit of dryness.
Oldenberg Raspberry Wheat;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Oldenberg Brewing Company;I don't like fruit beers but this one is non-threatening and quite good. I liked it the more I drank it. Funny how beer is like that!

Oldenberg Pious Pale Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oldenberg Brewing Company;"Bottled version of this brew showed up at the bar I work at on Friday. One of the perks of being a bartender is you can get a few ""shift drinks"" after closing. I had a Brooklyner Weisse first and then decided to give a Pious Ale a try. My sampled poured flat in the glass with no aroma, or flavor. Hops were long gone and I was not impressed. I read here the brewery is out of business so I can only guess how old these beer actually are. The Grey Lodge Pub has four cases of Pious Ale, I have a feeling we’ll have these beers in our fridge for some time to come."
Oldenberg Pious Pale Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oldenberg Brewing Company;Strongly hopped ale. A tad much for me. Nice amber color with a good head. Strong hoppy flavor. Finishes with a tangy dry acridness.

Oldenberg Pious Pale Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oldenberg Brewing Company;"Tried this at the Cincinnati (N.Kentucky) Airport; what a way to spend a layover. The beer was extremely well-hopped - aroma- and flavor-wise. Had a slightly malty, sweet ""backdrop"" for which the fresh and tasty hops were staged. Def one of the best beers I've had in an airport. If you're ever in the Cinci airport, head over to Concourse C (I think it was). A really impressive brew."
Oldenberg Holy Grail Nut Brown Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Brown Ale;Oldenberg Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Hazy orange brown color. Rocky beige head. Nutty, toasted malt nose. Tangy, hazelnut malt flavor. Nice hop finish. Quite good.
Oldenberg Holy Grail Nut Brown Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Brown Ale;Oldenberg Brewing Company;From a twelve ounce bottle purchased at the Glenway Crossing IGA - This one pours a fizzy, dark brown liquid with a malty aroma and a lasting tan head of foam. Tastewise, it’s a bit light on body for a brown ale, but it is good!
Oldenberg Holy Grail Nut Brown Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Brown Ale;Oldenberg Brewing Company;"RIP I'll give it a rate 'cause I drank the beer and have the notes. On Tap at an airport. I asked for a description of their offerings and got the ""this one's a lager, this one's a Pilsner"" stuff from the server. When I told him Pilsners were lagers he agreed that they were both made with bottom fermenting yeast. So I don't know if he knew what he was talking about or not! Anyway it was a decent but uninspiring brown ale. And in an airport any thing is better than a Bud light with cigarette smoke. Just an average brown ale nevertheless."
Oldenberg Holy Grail Nut Brown Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Brown Ale;Oldenberg Brewing Company;Hands down the worst beer I have ever had. Not bad in the standard way, no flavor watery and fizzy. No bad in a whole new what the heck did I drink mish-mash of sweetness and sourness and bizzare malt. Legendary. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.
Oldenberg Holy Grail Nut Brown Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Brown Ale;Oldenberg Brewing Company;Decent malty ale, description of this beer fits it perfectly, I also prefer Samuel Smiths. Then again SS makes a lot of good ones. I just wish that Oldenberg's restaurant was still open here in Louisville, it went from being voted #1 new restaurant in 1999 to closing a few years later, We had some good times there.
Oldenberg Holy Grail Nut Brown Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Brown Ale;Oldenberg Brewing Company;Not a bad brown, nutty malt nose, nutty taste...............................

Oldenberg Crosleys Red Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Oldenberg Brewing Company;Dark red brown beer with a head. Very Hoppy-astringent nose. Sharp and stron hops in the taste finishing very tartly. Not my style to be sure, yet not that good surely as well.
