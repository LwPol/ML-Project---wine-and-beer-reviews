Bowland Gold;Clitheroe, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bowland Brewery;Draught (Geldart, Cambridge) Spicy fruity aroma, a fair bit of apple there. Flattish palate, but at this strength it’s a nice quaff that slips down easily to quanch a thirst or accompany a meal. Taste has some honey aspects. Simple pale bitter, not unpleasant, but not exciting me either.

Hop Back Spring Zing (Cask);Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Cask pint in the Pheasant, Wellington Shropshire on 17th April 2016. Light golden pour with a full white head. Floral nose and flavour: sun was shining, suited the beer. Nothing overpowering or strong to be found here: subtle nose and taste. Refreshing more than tasty, but decent enough for a Sunday lunchtime throwing beer.

Fairly coarse and gripping forced hop bitterness. Odd thin mouthfeel with a frothing/cloying finish. Dry lemony sook on the finish.

Moninger Extra Dry Pilsener;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hatz-Moninger Brauhaus Karlsruhe;(Bottle, 0,33 Litres) Bright blond colour, quite good head, hardly diverges from the standard Moninger Pilsener, a bit harder and pasthauling in the aftertaste, but the Extra Dry Pilsener is not so well-balanced as it’s brother after all. --- 10.04.04
Moninger Extra Dry Pilsener;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hatz-Moninger Brauhaus Karlsruhe;(Bottle 33 cl) Golden, decent head. Some hop-aroma, but mainly hop-bitterness - and that’s quite some bitterness. And driness. Not really a pleasure. 230105
Moninger Extra Dry Pilsener;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hatz-Moninger Brauhaus Karlsruhe;Pale yellow body, snow white head. Maizy aroma. Malt and little hop in the rather harsh flavor. I do not enjoy these kind of beers.
Moninger Extra Dry Pilsener;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hatz-Moninger Brauhaus Karlsruhe;A pale yellow beer with a small white head. The aroma is sweet and quite hoppy. The flavor is very hoppy and grassy which gives it a dry bitter end.

Moninger Extra Dry Pilsener;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hatz-Moninger Brauhaus Karlsruhe;Herbal, present hop aroma. Pale color, low carbonation and a unstable head. Decent malt flavour, quite bitter but well balanced. Finish in nice bitter with some aroma hop notes. Aftertaste is, as expected, dry, but the beer isn’t “extra dry” like promised. For me it was no fault.
Moninger Extra Dry Pilsener;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hatz-Moninger Brauhaus Karlsruhe;"Clear gold; good Champagne-coloured head, leaving some lace. Chaff, ""milk-ripe"" grain nose, turning into both grassy and 'wet dog' aroma's. Quite bitter and, no doubt, very dry. Bitterness keeps well in the palate, displaying finally a rather sharp edge. Appropriately named, hence rather light bodied. The intention is clearly attained, the rest follows. The final sharpness might be regretted, but is probably unavoidable - I would drink it again."
Moninger Extra Dry Pilsener;Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hatz-Moninger Brauhaus Karlsruhe;0.33l bottle The name is misleading, this beer is not in the same category as Asahi super dry at all. Delicate flowery hop aroma, present but not overpowering. Pale golden, low carbonation, lacing white head which could be more stable. Malt levels keep to the background complemented with subtle, not too bitter hops. Bitterhop exit could be more pronounced, the beer just fades away drily but without bite. Medium body, prickling mouthfeel.

Big Bear Blueberry Light;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Bear Brewing Company;Draft - Sweet pure blueberry. Hazy yellow gold with a decent white head. Tons of blueberry and not much else. If you like blueberries and hate beer this is what you need.
Big Bear Blueberry Light;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Bear Brewing Company;Draft in a flight. Served with three small blueberries dropped through the white head. Changed the head in those places to purple. Kind of cool delivery. It’s their light pilsner with blueberries. Not bad overall. Blueberry, cereal, hay. Very light.
Big Bear Blueberry Light;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Bear Brewing Company;Draft. Backlog from Oct 2012. Amber in the glass with a white head that left a thin layer lasting. Blueberry aroma. The flavor found wheat and blueberry. Light body, with a blueberry aftertaste.
Big Bear Blueberry Light;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Bear Brewing Company;On draft at Big Bear. For what this beer is, a blueberry flavored beer, it’s pretty good, and a light one at that. Something nice and easy to drink on a summers day.
Big Bear Blueberry Light;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Bear Brewing Company;on tap-pours yellow/gold with a tight white head. Aroma is blueberry, 2nd sweet grain. Taste is herbal, blueberry, 2nd sweet grain.
Big Bear Blueberry Light;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Bear Brewing Company;Draft at brewer. Another style I don’t care for. A gold pour with a thin off white head. Scent is ...surprise..blueberry! Taste however, is blueberry with some grain and bread notes.

Big Bear Blueberry Light;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Bear Brewing Company;Draft @ Big Bear. Pours clear gold with a white head. Nose is slight malt with lots of Blueberry extract. Almost pulpy blueberry. Flavor is light blueberry, some lager, and maybe a breadiness. Finish lingers with blueberry. They even serve this bad boy with blueberries in it. No me gusta. I’ll take the stout, thanks.
Big Bear Blueberry Light;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Bear Brewing Company;Poured up on tap at the brewpub gold with thin off white head. It smells of all blueberry extract syrup and really nothing else. This doesn’t bode well for the flavor. The taste is full on blueberry extract syrupy sweetness and only has hints of malts and vague hops way in the background. May as well be a blueberry soda. Not that great.
Big Bear Doppelbock;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Big Bear Brewing Company;On draft at Big Bear. Pours deep copper with a receding white head. Nose is malt, esters, yeast, syrup, and slight chocolate. It was really hard to get the nose on this one- had to warm it up. Flavor is similar with a nice sweetness to it. Could not figure if this one was lagered- if it was, then the yeast character is hidden well. Medium-bodied beer that finishes with dark notes.
Big Bear Doppelbock;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Big Bear Brewing Company;Poured up on tap at the Big Bear brewpub with clear amber body with copper edges and light tan head. The faint aroma might have vague sweetness going on but really nothing else I can detect. The taste has big sweet notes consisting of sweet malts, sweet caramel malts and a touch of malt roastiness. As it gets toward midway I get fairly bold levels of fruity esters notes like prunes, figs, crushed juicy plums and cherries.
Big Bear Doppelbock;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Big Bear Brewing Company;On tap. Pour is a medium to dark brown. Lots of nice malty flavor in this one with a good amount of residual sugar and a smooth lager finish. The ABV, while hidden in the taste, definitely makes itself known by the end of the glass. Very well balanced and enjoyable brew. One of my favorites at Big Bear.
Big Bear Doppelbock;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Big Bear Brewing Company;No secret this isnt my favorite style. looks, smells, and almost tastes a lot like coca cola. Very pot roast tasting in the body and finish. heavy body, bold malt/molasses hybrid finish.
Big Bear Irish Dry Stout;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Stout - Dry;Big Bear Brewing Company;This beats the hell out of Guinness for sure. Lighting was low in the bar but appeared opaque with a nice thick creamy head. Classic stout aromas, roasted malt and a hint of cocoa. Body was creamy and satisfying. Flavor was also nice. Roasted malt, chocolate and really dry. Dry and slightly bitter finish. Overall this was the best of what I sampled here. Worth a visit.
Big Bear Irish Dry Stout;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;Stout - Dry;Big Bear Brewing Company;Dry as hell. nitrogen'd as well. light chocolate with heavy cold coffee flavors. finishes dry and smoothe, leaving your mouth parched. 9/04 had this again and found it a little more complex. very smoothe and chewy. a roasty flavor that finished with a mix of chocolate and roasted malts. definitely a different take.
Bethlehem Brew Works Iron Monkey IPA;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Fegley's Brew Works;Draft at Sippin By the River ’05. Knockout IPA, better than some of the best Hop Devil pours that I’ve had. Will try to make it out to the Brew Pub some time. 4.6%?
Bethlehem Brew Works Iron Monkey IPA;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Fegley's Brew Works;On draught at the works. Aroma primarily hoppy, light spice and fruit. Arrived a golden color with a nice wht head. Flavor was good, piney hops with touch of spice. Palate was medium and had a nice mouthfeel. Overall a good IPA that could just use a little more hop to it.
Bethlehem Brew Works Iron Monkey IPA;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Fegley's Brew Works;Dark straw pour with aroma of hopcit, slight fruit, slight spice. Medium palate, and not much complexity. The hops are there, but this one isn’t an upper tier IPA. Has some maibockish finishing hints.
Bethlehem Brew Works Iron Monkey IPA;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Fegley's Brew Works;This was a basically unremarkable IPA, except for the slight apricot flavor in the finish, and slightly fruity nose... otherwise, most like many other American IPA’s
Bethlehem Brew Works Iron Monkey IPA;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Fegley's Brew Works;On tap. Poured a medium amber with a tan head. Floral and spicy aromas and tastes. Light malty balance. Very drinkable IPA.
Bethlehem Brew Works Iron Monkey IPA;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Fegley's Brew Works;"Very nice. Hoppy and refreshing, nice hop bitterness. Not an overwhelming hop flavor, just a smooth drinking IPA. Not a ""OMG it’s sooo hoppy"" IPA, just a ""Yeah, this is a good IPA"" IPA. Liked it a lot."
Bethlehem Brew Works Iron Monkey IPA;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Fegley's Brew Works;From Growler, This is a dark reddish colour with a nice white head of foam. Aromas are hoppy, with a sweet malt backbone in there as well. This one is very reminiscent of the Masala Mama from Town Hall, although this is a bit lighter. The taste is hoppy with a bready malt middle, and a sweet leaf hop flavor. The mouthfeel is nice, not too thick, but just right for the stlye. A very hoppy IPA, that is lighter than most are.
Kraftbrau Amber Bock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Kraftbrau Brewery;tap at brewpub - Pours an almost ruby color and has a caramel malt nose. That caramel carries into the dominant flavor, but it’s also got a moderately strong hops kick. There seems to be a lot of hops for the style. It’s good though.
Kraftbrau Amber Bock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Kraftbrau Brewery;Sour aroma elements, bif viennaish creamy carmel and slight roast even in the aroma. Sticky body and nice nice noble hop background but it got swept away by too much sweetness. Coulda been good!
Kraftbrau Wheat Tripel Bock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kraftbrau Brewery;Sampled (and re-sampled) at Great Taste. This was a big, beautiful beer. Deep, rich caramel color. Roasted malts with small hop presence. Alcohol was present, but in a good way. One of the highlights at the fest. Great job. Nice guys working at their stand, too.
Kraftbrau Wheat Tripel Bock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kraftbrau Brewery;Sampled this beer at the Great Taste of the Midwest in Madison WI. Even though my scores on this are accurate and well researched, Da Man wants me to say more about the beer, so I will. Wow, this was incredible beer. Between theis and Bell's, I want to move to Kalamazoo.!
Kraftbrau Wheat Tripel Bock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kraftbrau Brewery;"Dark Dark brown, no head at all. Aroma was alchohol and a refined malt presence; caramel rich and also burnt and smoky. Hop action in the flavor fades but the malt is handled fairly well."
Old Hat Kolsch;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Old Hat Brewery;Reviewed from notes. Pours a very clear yellow straw color with plenty of carbonation. Nose is light straw and grain husks without much else. The taste is similar. Light and crisp with a tad bit of fruit. Drinks fairly well in the summer, though it is quite plain. Serving type: growler Reviewed on: 11-01-2010
Old Hat Kolsch;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Old Hat Brewery;Probably a better selection for the summertime as it is relatively light bodied. Pours a cloudy yellow color topped with a surprisingly thick white head. A ton of lacing left on the glass. Aroma seems vanilla and sweet while the flavor is very sweet, slightly vanilla tasting and the mouthfeel was watery and thin. Very waterlike aftertaste making me look for more. I can see drinking this in the hot sun, but overall it’s not a very good beer.
Old Hat Kolsch;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Old Hat Brewery;what the fuck, why was this sourish? well i cant explain this phenomenom but i kinda dug it. weird and citrusy, odd indeed, but not bad, just weird.
Old Hat Kolsch;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Old Hat Brewery;this was pretty intense for a kolsh. not what i expected. tasted more like a lambic or geuze. weird and slightly terrible aroma, but nice grapefruit and lemony scent. sour on the finish and pretty thin for the amount of flavor.
Old Hat Kolsch;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Old Hat Brewery;This one was a bit strange for the style but I liked it. A yellow appearance. It had a very lambic quality to it. A lemony aroma. A good deal of funk and dust present in the flavor. The aftertaste was sour. The palate was rather thin. I enjoyed it whatever it was.
Old Hat Kolsch;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Old Hat Brewery;Cloudy yellow/orange body, thin white fizzy head. Aroma is sweet, sugar cookie-like banana. Taste is a bit of spicy sourness with more banana. Slightly sticky mouthfeel, but a little too sour.
Old Hat Kolsch;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Old Hat Brewery;Bottle score by Silphium. Yellow-orange with a protein head and a slight cloudiness. The flavor is light and crisp with a sour finish. The sour taint is a too dominant and acrid and not characteristic of the style. Not much sweetness or malt flavors. The aroma harbors a boiled egg quality. No complexity. Not pleasant. Overall too much like sour lawn clippings.
Old Hat Kolsch;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Old Hat Brewery;"Pours hazy, cloudy golden-orange with plenty of yeast ""floaties,"" topped by a thin off-white head. Aroma is crackery, spicy, musty and bready. In other words, there’s lots of yeast in my glass. The flavor somewhat surprising- I picked up on some banana and apple peel; the beer is otherwise crackery/bready with a grassy, lightly spicy hops finish. The body is quite tart- this is especially evident by taking small sips. Could stand to be smoother and the acidity could be reduced. Otherwise likable."
Old Hat Kolsch;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Old Hat Brewery;"Not as buttery or smooth or sweet as some other Kolschs, thus (as most of you seems to believe) not as boring. Interesting, and fair (some bottles from this six are a tad more sour that others) - this brewery used to be owned by Bell's and was their lager house, but no more - it;s changed hands. I think they're doing an OK job. This is a perfectly golden and appropriate looking kolsch, grassy but too sharp ultimately. Too yeasty I think."
Elmwood Nut Brown Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Bottle and served in a Newcastle glass: Medium brown hue with a nice small foamy beige head and good lace. The nose detects walnut, earthy esters, a hint of tangerine acidity, and some grassy hops. The taste starts with a mild sweet nutty malt character along with some acidic twang with just a quick dash of bitters. Very short finish did show a flash of chocolate and tobacco. The mouth feel is softly carbonated and added a chalky aftertaste. A tepid beer with little depth to remember.
Elmwood Nut Brown Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Pours a dark brown, topped by a thick layer of light brown foam. the foam dies away almost completely in short order. Mildly malty aroma. The taste is semi-sweet malt with a bit of hazelnut (not hazelnut extract - real hazelnut) flavor up front. This is follwed by mildly roasted mocha. It finishes just a tad on the dry side with a hint of spicy hops. Not quite a medium body, moderate but prickly carbonation.
Elmwood Nut Brown Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Draught at the 2006 Iowa City Brew Fest. Clear brown color with off white head that left an impressive curtain of lace. Milk chocolately nose and flavor with a nutty/earthy note. Tasty and attractive beer.
Elmwood Nut Brown Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;This beer releases a nutty chocolate aroma. A deep poinsettia color with a medium sized head are the trademarks of this beer. The taste is stale and bitter. Luckily, it fades fast.
Elmwood Nut Brown Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;bottle-ohh man, what went wrong here? I wanted to try this beer, since the brewery is fairly close to where i went to college. pours mahogony with very light carbonation and not much head at all. aroma of chocolate, cashews and faint hops. wierd yeast twang as well. WTF? this flavor is rancid! cardboard, sour apples, baking chocolate and old hops. weak body and just not good.
Elmwood Nut Brown Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Poured a light brown with a hint of orange. The head was a light tan color. Light aroma of oranges and freshbread and oranges. The taste had old orange flavored gum and some grapefruit. Strange tasting for a brown. There is plenty of carbonation while in the bottle. I have had this on tap and in the bottle.
Elmwood Nut Brown Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Roasted malt with a hint of chocolate and slightly smoky. Some nuttiness. Little or no bitterness. Texture seems light and watered down, especially for the fairly rich flavors present.
Elmwood Nut Brown Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;slightly metalic smell, very dark amberish brown. nutty, not bad, not great, i dont believe that this should be as low as 10th percentile, but is nothing special. i didnt know that elmwood, il had its own brewery.
Elmwood Nut Brown Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Thanks to Degarth for this bottle. Pours a deep brown not unlike a Dr. Pepper. Small tan head. It’s cold but I can pick out some mild nuttiness, light caramel and malt. Taste is watery malt, faint caramel and hops, and not much nuttiness. Body is too thin. This is pretty basic but not nearly as bad as I was expecting upon reading some of the other reviews. Not sour smelling or tasting. Perhaps others had some bad bottles??? Finishes with thinned malt, light roasty notes, and light nuttiness. Again, it’s basic but not horrible. I’d drink this before BMC any day!
Elmwood Nut Brown Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Bottled. Nothing going on here. A little flat. To much malt. Not a very balanced beer.
Pendragon Pale Ale;Santa Paula, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Santa Monica Distillery / Excalibur Brewing;Ok cheap sixer from Outlet Grocer..brown 12 oz bottles..picture of a Romano-Celtic warrior on label, presumably Pendragon, King Arthur's father. The a roma is actually quite nice..sherbery cascade hops to be precise..least its not skunked. The beer is a nice clear amber colour with a pure white head. Flavour is sweet malts then nice but slightly subdued hops..semi dry finish..a bit watery but not bad really. Quite acceptable tongue feel to this ale. This is actually a just above average American Pale..not bad for what I paid.
Moon River Ogeechee Amber;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moon River Brewing Company;"Ratings by Veeve, Back by Popular Demand, on Vacay in the lovely Savannah, Georgia. This beer is found on tap at the MoonRiver restaurant and brewing site on Bay Street in Savannah, GA. A very average amber ale, tasty but nothing special. Color a weak, watered down copper hue. light hops. not ""burstin"" with flavor as its description on the menu suggests. medium mouthfeel, light. not that relaxing. run of the mill. refreshing. forgettable. citrus hops, spec of malt flavoring, lightly sweet."
Moon River Ogeechee Amber;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moon River Brewing Company;"Draught sample at the brewpub. Translucent gold with a lasting wisp of head as on all samples here....absolutely huge, thick nose full of caramelized malt, various dried and baked fruits (cherry and peachy dominant), a bit of maple and a hint of dry wood....sugary-sweet in the body, very thick and malty, a bit nutty, lightly alcoholic strangely but it’s amaretto, not boozy whiskey or anything....really juicy, just massively flavored for the style, perhaps not ""correct"" or anything but intensely enjoyable and complusively drinkable."
Moon River Ogeechee Amber;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moon River Brewing Company;This looks a LOT like their Swamp Fox India Pale Ale, with the clear, light amber body and decent-sized white foam on top. The flavors are very different, though. In the aroma and flavor, this really is hoppier than the IPA, although the bitterness of this is a good bit lower than that of the IPA. Fresh citrusy hops tingle the sinuses. There’s a decent bit of malt underneath in the aroma and the flavor, but this really isn’t malty for an amber. Tasty and easy drinking, but a surprise for the style. Light bodied.
Moon River Ogeechee Amber;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moon River Brewing Company;"Caramel, grain, toffee malt (M); floral hops (L). Deep gold body. Moderately sweet, lightly acidic flavor becomes a moderately bitter, lightly acidic, grainy finish. Medium-light body, watery texture, lively carbonation. The bottom line is: oversparged."
Moon River Ogeechee Amber;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moon River Brewing Company;Very light colored for an amber, even accused the bartender of pouring me an IPA! Decent, flowery, hoppy nose with a trace of spruce, good white head, with adequate lacing. More akin to a pale ale than an amber with more hop accents than malt. Decent, spicy bitterness and thick mouthfeel. Slight furity notes round it out nicely. Fades just a bit near the end of the pint, but not a bad way to sit out a Savannah thunderstorm.
Moon River Ogeechee Amber;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moon River Brewing Company;Light Cascade hop aroma. Very pale. Tastes like an American Golden Ale. Light acidity and light fruit, an almost PA character. Longish hoppy finish.

Huske Hardware Airborne Ale;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Huske Hardware House;Draught at the brewpub. Clear straw color with thin white head. Smells of zucchini bread. Slightly sweet and buttery. Pleasant aftertaste of sweet bread and honey. Good beer.
Huske Hardware Airborne Ale;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Huske Hardware House;Phenolic, cider-vinegary aroma. Doughy, lightly sweet, not very hoppy, grainy cereal quality. Granola bar finish on a watery body. Quits quickly.
Royal Bavaria Blonde Lager;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;"Draft at the brewpub, 11/14/06: Very still, slightly hazy. Laced head. Liquid lemon cookie; very sweet malt. Least favorite here."
Royal Bavaria Blonde Lager;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;"To the note of the previous rater, this beer does have a nice ""Koelsch-like quality"", although I would put it somewhere between a lager and a koelsch. It lacked the richness that I would have expected, but its flavor was still good. It was certainly the best looking beer at Royal Bavaria."
Royal Bavaria Blonde Lager;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;(Tap) Pours a blonde color with a lasting white head. This beer has nice and balanced crisp hoppy notes. Pretty decent body for a low alcohol beer. This is a light and refreshing brew, but lacking some of the German Koelsch-like qualities that one might expect from this beer.
Royal Bavaria Blonde Lager;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;Tap at the brewery: poured cloudy yellow with a small white head. Less offensive butter flavor than the other two but equally as bad. All these beers taste the same: Diacetyl bombs with very watery finishes. Very disappointing with these brews.
Royal Bavaria Blonde Lager;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;tap at brewpub-sampled at the OK gathering-pours clear yellow hue with nimimal white head. aroma is mostly spicy german hops and some sweet malt notes. flavors are dead on for a great lager-nice spicy noble hop presence and some slight grassy notes on the finish. almost kolsh-like. good lager!
Royal Bavaria Blonde Lager;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Royal Bavaria Restaurant and Brewery;This is probably my highest rated lager.

Huske Hardware Regimental Ale;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Huske Hardware House;Draught. So, I get the sampler and I just want to taste maybe three of them before my palate would give out. Just by having a whiff, they are almost identical in smell. This one in particular has a sour, lactic stink with a bit of caramel. Y’know come to think of it, the brewery itself smelled funny when I entered. Man, upon tasting this brew, I decided something is very amiss. There is mild chocolate in the thin, slimy mouth, but mostly a sour algae flavor. This is not good at all.
Huske Hardware Regimental Ale;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Huske Hardware House;Draft at Charlotte Oktoberfest 2006. Nothing really special going on here. Reddish colored pour without any head at all. Smell is some sweet malts and a little bit of a hop presence. Taste is bland and unexciting. As previous raters have suggested, this beer (brewery?) needs a serious revamp. This is no exception to that rule.
Huske Hardware Regimental Ale;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Huske Hardware House;Another not so great brew from the brewery. Also another miss leading name. Regimental Red, one would assume it would be an amber and not a brown ale. Either way a less than exciting brew.

Huske Hardware Regimental Ale;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Huske Hardware House;Large draught sample at the brewpub. Buttery, lightly herbal/medicinal nose escapes faintly from the translucent, clearly (no pun intended) unfiltered thick dark amber body with a lasting touch of head....body is sour, somewhat astringent and increasingly mineralic as it warms, cidery, with light carbonation, some dry woody hops towards the finish don’t really save it.
Huske Hardware Regimental Ale;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Huske Hardware House;Draught at the brewpub. Clear copper color with thin white head. Subtle caramel aroma with some metallic hops. Spicy and bitter, slightly sour with dried cherry undertones. Sour finish.
Huske Hardware Regimental Ale;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Huske Hardware House;Sampled at Charlotte Oktoberfest ’04. There really wasn’t enough hop in the flavor here - it had a sour feel but otherwise it was pretty watery. Needs work.
Huske Hardware Regimental Ale;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Huske Hardware House;Faint caramel malt aroma. Nut sweetish and a bit chemical, low acidity, light hops. Finish is slightly tangy with a medium-quick woody finish. Watery. Scotch coloring, lacy head.
Huske Hardware McNairs Scottish Brown;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Huske Hardware House;Growler. Brown with ruby highlights.

Aroma is medium malt. Taste is dark/medium malt-roasty/coffee/nutty, medium fruit/medicinal, faint hops. A bit light. Check the lines, honey wheat?! if that’s not it there’s an infection in the brewing process because something’s off, or the yeast is overpowering and not my style.
Huske Hardware McNairs Scottish Brown;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Huske Hardware House;Draught during my NC brew tour. Dammit. This smells just like the other beers except with less other aromas and more pronounced vinegar. in the flavor though, some faint tobacco and walnut flavors manage to come through. The finish is nuttier with a sour funk throughout. Carbonation is pretty low and sad lactic notes sicken my palate throughout. The 10% abv is hidden well by the nasty mess.
Huske Hardware McNairs Scottish Brown;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Huske Hardware House;pours out a very dark brown color with a small brown head. aroma is very malty and peaty. Flavor is malty and semi sweet. Not such a great brew. Miss lead by the name. i thought it would have been a scot ale, not a brown ale.
Huske Hardware McNairs Scottish Brown;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Huske Hardware House;Large draught sample at the brewpub. This was listed (April 2006) as 10% ABV so I assumed it would be more a Scotch Ale than anything else...hmmm....dark, opaque maple with a touch of fine lasting ring around the glass...dark, somewhat peaty-smoky nose does suggest Scotland or the ales thereof, woody and increasingly nutty/oily with warmth, touches of anise, tar and bitter chocolate, some good stuff here but not terribly well-blended nor strong enough....body is soured, cidery/lactic like 2 of the other 3 samples, very little hint of alcohol makes me wonder at that 10%, I’d have guessed 7 myself, bit tarry and prune-flavored, grapy at first though less so as it warms, low to medium carbonation and a fairly harsh, astringent finish. Some promise and interest here, derailed.
Huske Hardware McNairs Scottish Brown;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Huske Hardware House;Draught at the brewpub. Unfiltered. Hazy, brown color with tan head. Spicy hop nose with chocolate and alcohol undertones. Chocolate flavor with some sour ctirus and alcohol.

Bazens Knoll Street Porter;Salford, Greater Manchester, England;Porter;Star Inn;Cask (backlog). Coppery brown colour with a small slightly off-white head, which leaves some lace. Aroma is roasted malts, some slight chocolate, ashes and mild sugary sweetness to it as well. Flavour is chocolate, ashes, some roasted malts, mild bitterness along with some slight toffee as well.

Bullfrog Apricot Wheat;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bullfrog Brewery;"5oz sample from a flight. Pour is a bright gold with a finger of fluffy white head that went the distance. Nose is apricots, malt, and light hops; the apricot is the dominant presence in this one. Taste is the same, but the apricot and malt take pole position in sweet, fruity masquerade. The finish is more of the same, but it is well met by subtle hops to create balance. This is easy to drink, and quite sessionable, but not something I would go out of my way to find."

Soft and some white grape notes to go with floral. Somewhat generic, quite light overall and clean. On tasting, mid-dry with botanics and a light honey component. It’s a pretty standard traditional, lacks a bit of depth/complexity but that’s like due to the neutral honey. Good balance overall. Nice enough.

Schmitt Barley Wine;Porto Alegre (RS), Brazil;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;De Porto Ind. e Com. de Bebidas Ltda.;Nossa!!! Só de abrir, já saltaram aromas doces de iogurte, algum tipo de licor. Abrindo a garrafa deu pra ver mudanças físicas. Os sólidos e gases se difundindo violentamente pelo líquido. Algo bonito de se ver. Não apresentou nenhuma formação de espuma. Uma bela cor âmbar e opaca. Lembra melado grosso porém fluido. Alcoólica, forte, doce, frutas cítricas... Uma paulada! Seria muito bom ter um queijo forte, um roquefor, para acompanhar. O fundo lembra aqueles licores de cereja dentro de bombons de chocolate. No final, fica um gosto amargo persistente e seco. É uma experiência única. Recomendo veementemente. Acho que vale lembrar, já que é uma barley wine, que tomei uma cerveja com vencimento para 11 de maio de 2011, lote 15.

Also some unexpected sharp hops as this was billed as a mild. More presence, and a bit more alcohol, than most milds. Seems to sit somewhere between a mild and a porter in style. A pretty decent brew whatever it is.

A good dry finish and pretty bitter and sharp. Good stuff.
Glossop Dexters Best Bitter;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glossop Breweries;A full, biscuity, hoppy, well constructed brew which drinks beyond it’s strength. They have now closed, maybe due to consistence problems highlighted here! (Cask from Sheffield)
Glossop Dexters Best Bitter;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glossop Breweries;cask at my local, the old moot hall inn in nottingham. I find it hard to criticise new brewers because it is a difficult business.Hhowever, this beer was awful, almost tasted like cider. Also tried the ’summer bitter’ but that too tasted the same, both were taken off the bar.
Glossop Dexters Best Bitter;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glossop Breweries;"Bright bottled at Cambridge Fest. Fresh notes: ""Refreshing session bitter - light amber. Rancid melon or Indian fruit? Score 2.5"" And that’s about how I feel about it now. The hops are perhaps more noticable, and there’s a bit of grease. It’s not a great beer. Aroma is that Indian fruit again - the one whose name I can’t remember. Just remembered: mango."
Glossop Fletchers Campaign Bitter;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glossop Breweries;Cask, at Newark Beer Festival, May 2004. Notes recovered from a recently unearthed old notebook. This brewery had quality control issues from the outset and only lasted a few months. Those quality control issues were certainly on display here. It looked OK - regulation amber colour but there was a bad petrol and acetone taint in the flavour, followed by a rather sour fruit flavour. Don’t know whether they had an infection issue at the brewery or just didn’t do enough homework before releasing the beer but there was certainly something wrong here. As a point of interest, the kit (and the casks) ended up at Olfabrikken.
Glossop Fletchers Campaign Bitter;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glossop Breweries;Cask conditioned - handpump - Malt Shovel Northampton. Golden coloured bitter with a sour aroma. The taste is also on the sour side and is a struggle to get down. A bit of a mish mash
Glossop Fletchers Campaign Bitter;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glossop Breweries;Gravity at the Rail Ale Beer Festival, Barrow Roundhouse, Chesterfield. Rather unpleasant beer, teeming with questionable vegetable flavours - beetroot, lettuce and sugared radish. A strong flavour all the way down the thraot. Acidic and turpentine. Sandy brown colour, no head and a chocolate aroma.

Green Jack Canary Pale Ale;Lowestoft, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Green Jack Brewing Co.;Holy Madonna. None of my mates managed to end this one. Some pints to the fishes in the Wensum river in Norwich. We should attend a game at Carrow Road in Norwich a couple of hours later. So a Canary pint sounded like a safe bet. How wrong can a man be. Norwich City made up for the mistake by winning their game 1-0! Clear caramel golden color with almost no head. Caramel malty aroma with a low intensity. Medium light body and a soft to flat carbonation level. Tad sweet and almost no bitterness. Way out of balance. Caramel malt, cardboard and cooked vegetables in the flavor. Ohh noooo we want the money back. Maybe the fishes in the river enjoyed it….. [Handpull at Ribs of Beef in Norwich, England]

Sensation : Mince, effervescence moyenne, amertume de bonne longueur, malt court. Bref :Définitivement une Bitter équilibrée entre le malt et le houblon.

Charlevoix La Vache Folle ESB;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;Slightly veiled dark amber color with moderate activity. Soft creamy beige 2 finger head, lasting around 5-10 minutes, with dense lacing but faint legs. Flavors of caramel, nutmeg, ginger, roasted grains, lemon, yeast, herbal spices. Bread and toffee sugary feel, with sharp zesty fruity that balance things out. Slick milky medium body with crispy and prickly carbonation.

Interesting creamy density (a trademark for La vache folle?), still nicely fresh, with some sharp yeast. Quite tasty and filling, but uplifting like a Belgian. Overall very good quality craft. A robust ESB, heavily spiced and probably too much, not as delicate and pleasant compared to the Fuller’s.

Triverius 500;Brakel, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Graal;Bottle from Willems. Slighty oily pale golden, small head. Aroma wheat, nutmeg, light citrus, even traces of alcohol. Taste wheat, oranges, spices. Very soft and malty, spices and oranges well restraint, adding depth to the malts. A little ( too ) sweetish even. Taste could have been a bit stronger though, certainly considering the relatively high abv.
Triverius 500;Brakel, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Graal;Clear pale yellow with a disappointing and quickly disappearing head. Some lemon, malts and coriander at first, but then a metallic undertone slips in, with some detergent. Mouthfeel is good though. Finish is short and watery
Triverius 500;Brakel, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Graal;Nous sommes donc clairement sur les épices avec cette Triverius. Structure particulière cependant avec en opposition une composante acidulée procurant de la fraîcheur et une composante épicée, plus lourde en bouche. Le résultat, plutôt agréable, même si au final, une ampleur plus importante eu pu être appréciable, mais bière qui manque cruellement de variation avec une ligne linéaire. Joli blond doré en verre (EBC aux alentours de 17) avec une forte effervescence et une mousse blanche de 5 mm d'épaisseur. Le nez est d'une belle complexité et plein, un peu laiteux sur le fruit (banane, poire, pêche), le pain et les épices (coriandre/gingembre). L'attaque est d'emblée acidulée. On retrouve toutes les composantes du nez avec en avant les épices (présence poivrée complémentaire, et en arrière plan les fruits et le pain. La deuxième bouche n'est que plus acidulée. Aucune évolution aromatique. Pas davantage également sur l'arrière bouche qui est cependant plus équilibrée et ample. Le final marque quant à lui un bon élancement, avec un houblon légèrement plus présent mais surtout des épices qui restent en bouche. Longueur et corpulence sont tout de même moyennes. A découvrir, mais pas à redécouvrir.

Triverius 500;Brakel, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Graal;330ml bottle BB Aug 2017. Quite clear amber with frothy white head. Aromas of white pepper, pear, candi sugar.

Pours slightly hazy pale golden yellow color with a small dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of cracker, white bread, light honey, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Bit of fruity aromas, but not too overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread, light honey, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. Very mild herbal/grassy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread, light honey, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of pale malt and mild earthy hop flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Fairly clean on lager flavors, not overly fruity. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a smooth, fairly bready/grainy, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is okay. Thin, but not too watery. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is is a pretty solid German pilsener. Nice robustness of pale malt and mild earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the minimally bitter/drying finish. Obviously not fresh, but not bad. Fairly clean pils malts and mild hop balance. Would likely be much better fresh. Not as crisp/refreshing as it should be. Fairly enjoyable."

Es sind aber unterschiedliche Biere. Das ""1516 Victory Hop Devil"" wird in WIen gebraut und kommt mir etwas aromatischer und dafür weniger fruchtig. Das mag aber auch daran liegen, dass man das 1516er vom Fass und das amerikanische nur in der Flasche (auch in Wien) bekommt.

Keegan Ales Old Capital;Kingston, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Keegan Ales;Blind tasted with 3 other golden ales. Beers were 1. Finch Big Pond 2. Alaskan Gold Creek Session Ale 3. Omission Ultimate Light Golden Ale 4. Keegan Ales Old Capital. Both raters rated the beers 3214. 355ml bottle. Golden pour. Mostly inoffensive but it is a touch vegetal.
Keegan Ales Old Capital;Kingston, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Keegan Ales;355 ml bottle. Pours a cloudy golden colour with a huge frothy white head. Lots of retention. Aroma is grain, fruits, some hops. Taste is grain, some banana, citrus. Refreshing golden ale.
Keegan Ales Old Capital;Kingston, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Keegan Ales;Slight sweet malty aroma, almost a lemon hoppy character over a crisp lager like beer. No foot funk of lager though. Bit of a banana nutty yeasty flavor with a crisp lemon like maltiness. For a lighter beer this has some good body and flavor. Has an odd dry almost slightly soapy finish. Not a bad beer. Nothing I would seek out but is flavorful for a light beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Keegan Ales Old Capital;Kingston, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Keegan Ales;Draft, 8 August 2015 at BCTC, Ommegang Brewery. Murky gold color, some head in the sample glass. Aroma is sweet grain, mild fruit and traces of a unknown hop variety. Flavor will not throw you a curve ball, just as the aroma leads to to believe. Lighter body with a sweet grain/ corn finish. No off flavors and no problems. Just an ordinary blond ale, easy drinking.
Keegan Ales Old Capital;Kingston, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Keegan Ales;This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking hazy bronzed yellow to orange color. A decent transparency runs about. Carbonation runs upward at a moderate pace. A slim fingered foamy head sits for about a minute before dissipating adequately. The smell starts off with sweet apricot and a mildly sweet lemon combines over some light malt. There’s a light crisp refreshing grassiness there as well. The taste is mainly sweet through the fruity notes mentioned earlier. Light grassy hops balance in a slight bitter fashion. The light apricots come back in the aftertaste and leave a grassy finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a nice sessionable aspect to it. Carbonation runs fairly light on the tongue and leaves a semi-crisp yet smooth malty feature running over my tongue. Overall, for a blonde/golden ale, this is definitely one of the better ones on the market. Definitely makes the haters of the style reconsider their thoughts on the style.
Keegan Ales Old Capital;Kingston, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Keegan Ales;12 Fl. Oz. Bottle. Poured yellow, clear, small white head. Aroma of citrus fruit, floral notes and mild grain notes. Bitter taste, pale malts, grain and some fruit. Drinkable, crisp and refreshing... Happy 4th y’all.

Keegan Ales Old Capital;Kingston, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Keegan Ales;Bottle pour. Fizzed over on opening. Clean straw gold in class with very active head. Aroma is apricot, sweet, honey-esque grains. Body in thin. Taste has some light caramel, dried apricots. Some lemon candy. A weird, metallic aftertaste.
Keegan Ales Old Capital;Kingston, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Keegan Ales;Yellow pour with creamy off white head and lace. Aroma is light malt and floral hops. Flavor mirrors aroma with an ok bitter finish. Medium bodied and a tad fizzy for me. Still pretty solid.
Vandenheuvel EKLA;Ukkel, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brasserie de l'Imprimerie;"(Bottled) Hazy golden color with a smallish, quite tight head. Lots of big yeast clumps in the bottom of bottle. Nice, fresh and lamony hop aroma with a clear, sourish lambicky feel. Fruity flavor of fresh, lemony-grassy hops. Medium-bodied, fresh and crisp, slightly sour palate with balanced carbonation. A very pleasant, balanced and interesting, refrehing brew. Somewhere between Duvel, XX-bitter and lambic. Could buy again ;)"
Vandenheuvel EKLA;Ukkel, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brasserie de l'Imprimerie;Bottle White, large, firm, rocky head, which lasts mostly. Hazy yellow body. Quite a lot of CO_2 in the body. Good lace. Nose of citrus and fine malts. Strange, doubtful flavour for a pilsener (at least in the beginning). Moderately bitter, lightly sour intial flavour. Lightly bitter, lightly sour finish. It was quite weird tasting this, because I was wondering whether I liked it. But it defenitely is not as flavourless like the big brands’ pilseners. I quite like it anyway.
Vandenheuvel EKLA;Ukkel, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brasserie de l'Imprimerie;"Pale gold; lacey white head. A markedly nose of CO², grassy too. Chalk, slight acidity (really) in the taste - not lactic or acetic, not even wheat. Herbal, no doubt and some diacetyl. Very light bodied, refreshing - something you have ot drink and fast. Nice, typical house-brewery beer, but in a good way. Carries an age-old Brussels name. I just wonder if their beers are really brewed on the premises..."
Blanche de St. Job;Ukkel, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie de l'Imprimerie;"Hazy greenish yellow beer; little white head. Coriander and Chinese batter for deep-frying in the nose. Coriander, and a little citrus in the taste, and again an exotic Eastern flavour - maybe lemongrass? Creamy, fluffy mouthfeel, light bodied. At the end of the ride, an average white. Not bad, not better."
Vandenheuvel Double Export;Ukkel, Belgium;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie de l'Imprimerie;Bottled Clear amber color, cloudy off-white head. Woody mildly hoppy but same time fruity aroma. Medium-bodied. Malty and sweet flavor. Sugary, maybe slightly diacetylic flavor. Sweet and unbalanced.
Vandenheuvel Double Export;Ukkel, Belgium;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie de l'Imprimerie;(Bottled) Quite clear amber color with a large, foamy and lasting head. Somewhat sugary-syrupy and sourish, fruity aroma. Sweetish, slightly sour flavor with caramely malt and some dried fruit. No signs of alcohol. A decent, although quite sweet brew. Not sure of the style, though.
Vandenheuvel Double Export;Ukkel, Belgium;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie de l'Imprimerie;Bottle Quite clear, amber body. Off-white, frothy-rocky, large, firm head. Mostly lasting head. Spare lace. Nose of pine, citrus, malts (straw). Lightly bitter initial flavour, moderately bitter finish, with some alcohol. I found it as weird as the pilsener, but not as good.
Vandenheuvel Double Export;Ukkel, Belgium;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie de l'Imprimerie;Clear amber, little white head. Very bready nose, bit of peanuts. Sweet taste, crystal malts giving a very English impression, but devoid of hops. Medium-bodied, but watery texture. Beginning is promessing, but the finish/palate leaves completely to be desired. Pity, it might have been a hit.
Stout Vandenheuvel;Ukkel, Belgium;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Brasserie de l'Imprimerie;"Nearly black dark brown; little pale head. Virtually exempt of any nose/aroma/smell. My co-taster detects raisins. Taste is liquorice, sof-sweet; very much like a dark mild, rather than a stout, even a sweet one. Dark malts, nothing roasted, all soft. Retronasal there's a slight smokey flavour. Well-bodied, though the sweetness seem to come from the liquorice, rather than from fermented malts. As said, the brewery calls it a stout. I'd say a strongish, sweet mild."
Chiyonosono Shinriki (Sacred Power) Junmai Ginjo Sake;Yamaga-shi, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Chiyonosono Shuzo Co., Ltd.;This is a rich, full flavored sake with hints of tropical fruits and cantaloupe. The mouth feel is silky with pear flavors. A mellow sake that has a lot of texture.

Chiyonosono Shinriki (Sacred Power) Junmai Ginjo Sake;Yamaga-shi, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Chiyonosono Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Slightly sweet liquor smell. Like a brandy and water. Alittle buttery and slightly sweet. Not the best sake I had not bad though. Strong alcohol warmth. Better than Gekkeikan.
Chiyonosono Shinriki (Sacred Power) Junmai Ginjo Sake;Yamaga-shi, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Chiyonosono Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Adequate, though what I’d consider a lower quality sake. Frankly, anything I find at my local Ennju sushi store is generally not all that good, and this is no exception. Buttery mouthfeel with some alcohol burn. Only mildly complicated flavor profile with some sweetness and flavor punch.

McKenzie OReillys Irish Red;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale - Irish;McKenzie Brew House;Pours a slightly cloudy, dark golden copper color with dark amber edges and a half finger off-white head that quickly settles into a thin, lasting ring. Sporadic spotty lacing. Bland aroma with subtle spice and earthy hops. Dominated by sweet malt with hints of rye, caramel, toffee and dark fruit. Medium bodies with a surprising hop forward flavor profile followed by a sweet malt backbone. Crisp, spicy hop bite lingering over caramel malt sweetness, spicy rye, toffee, bread and dark fruit notes. Easy to drink with a subtle hop component countering the strong malt presence.

McKenzie Hefe Weizen;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;McKenzie Brew House;Quality at the Glen Mills brewhouse is vastly superior to the Malvern brehouse, this white beer is a good example. True to the style, nice citurs hop notes, perfect blonde cloudy appearance good finish. Something odd, though (maybe it is just my palate) - it had a funny heavy water taste in the first moments in my palate, weird.
McKenzie Hefe Weizen;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;McKenzie Brew House;Had this at the brewhouse in Melvern. Good hefe appearance. Cloudy and strw colored. Interesting slightly sour aroma. Some gumball flavors and a little tart on the tongue without being overly fruity. This stuff is not sweet, nor is it overly spiced. It does have the essence of a good hefe without being over the top. Not overwhelming in any one of the attributes which make a hefe. Some banana and very little bitterness can be detected. Decent rather friendly brew.
McKenzie Hefe Weizen;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;McKenzie Brew House;July 2007 - Really light pour, pale pale yellow with white highlights. Aroma smelled like corn. This beer is highlighted by a sharp citrusy zing (instead of typical banana like fruity flavors) behind a nice wheat and mild clove base. Pretty good.
McKenzie Hefe Weizen;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;McKenzie Brew House;McKenzie’s in Glen Mills, PA-Draft, Yellowish-orange coloring. Fairly light even for a hefe weizen. More an america feel with a yeast feel and a wheaty aroma. Overall not bad, just pretty low for a hefe weizen for my liking.
McKenzie Hefe Weizen;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;McKenzie Brew House;Hazy yellow with fizzy head. Aroma of banana and wheat. The taste wsas the same. decent beer, refreshing.
McKenzie Hefe Weizen;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;McKenzie Brew House;Golden yellow color with a fizzy white head. Aroma is light, sweet, and citrusy – bits of lemon and coriander thrown in as well. Taste is light and sweet with some sharp citrus, coriander, light wheat, and a nice tanginess to it. Nice on a hot day, but more into Wit territory than a true Hefe should be
McKenzie Hefe Weizen;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;McKenzie Brew House;Ah, not a bad beer... actually pretty enjoyable. But, about on par for the hefe family. This beer poured a pale cloudy color with almost a fluorescent green tint. The aroma was clove-like and somewhat citrusy. In terms of flavor, the spices were minimal beyond the mild cloves and the citrus was most detectable. The flavor was somewhat weak and any hint of bananas was absent. Mouthfeel was light. I’d have it again, but not if it were lined up with some other great hefes on draft.
McKenzie Hefe Weizen;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;McKenzie Brew House;Poured a cloudy golden/brown body with a white head. Aroma is mostly bananas with some malts and dough. Flavors were bananas, sweet bubble gum, and yeast. Good, refreshing hefe. Medium/thin mouthfeel.
McKenzie Shanes Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McKenzie Brew House;[Draft @ EB+B] Golden with a small, white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of toasted malts, toffee, grass, saaz, and citrus fruits. Taste of toffee, almonds, toasted malts, citrus fruits, grass, and a lightly bitter finish.
McKenzie Shanes Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McKenzie Brew House;From draught at McKenzie Brew House II. Nice light beany Saaz hops aroma with some pilsner malt sweetness. Muted nose but decent. Light yellow clear body with slight chill haze, topped with white lacing head. Medium light watery body with medium-light carbonation, soft and perfect for the style. Starts pretty hoppy and has nice tempered pilsner malty sweetness. Carbonic acidic bite in the finish. Overall, nice example but muted and slightly oxidized. Pretty good with robust bitter finish and malt sweet after.
McKenzie Shanes Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McKenzie Brew House;tasted @ Malvern. pours light gold with virtually no head. the saaz comes right through in the spicy, floral aroma. light bitterness, slightly metallic. taste is light saaz hops, slight metal, lemon peel, slight maltiness and grapefruit. not bad. finish lingers with a lemony hint. a little oily, a little thin.
McKenzie Shanes Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McKenzie Brew House;Had this at the brewpub in Melvern. Nice frresh just plain good beer aroma, perhaps a little tart. My sample looked more like a good hefe than a pilsner. It was cloudy, hazy and straw colored. Tea froth head. On the initial tastes, very mild on the taste buds. Not much pilsner bite and I appreciated that. However, as the session continues, there is a buildning pilsner bite that is sneaking up from behind. Typical pilsner finish, medium bitter linger. Pilsner bite end medium to mild.
McKenzie Shanes Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McKenzie Brew House;Taste just like a pilsner. Czch sazz hop taste and aroma. Fresh tasteing. With tart finish. Good beer.
McKenzie Shanes Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McKenzie Brew House;hop tea. cloudy, and just too many hops. very unbalanced beer. tastes more like an ale.from sampler, dirty glass, again! no head...
McKenzie Shanes Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McKenzie Brew House;on tap-pours a white head and yellow color. Aroma is light/medium malt, secondary hops-citrus, perfumy. Taste is light/medium malt balanced with hops-citrus/bitter-pine. Light/medium body. OK effervescence on front of the tongue.
McKenzie Shanes Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McKenzie Brew House;Light golden color with pils/saaz mix in the nose. Taste is light and crisp, but falls short of the better pils you can find close by (Victory, Sly Fox). Crisp and refreshing, but average.
McKenzie Shanes Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McKenzie Brew House;Draft at the brewpub, July 2006. A yellow beer with a rim of white head. The aroma is sweet malty with light notes of oranges, while the flavor is a fine delicate one with a good malt back ground on which are notes of oranges, that lead to a very dry grassy and citrusy end with a good deal of bitterness.
McKenzie Shanes Gold;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McKenzie Brew House;Draught pint at the Malvern location on 10/6/06 with Dickinsonbeer. Head retention seemed to leave a little to be desired on the beers we had this day, but other than that, a lucid bronze body is clear and shows minimal carbonation. The white head is initially small and dissipates rather steadily, leaving behind light, spotty lacing. Fresh, crisp, biting and bitter hops in the nose are luscious and wonderfully utilized. Very strong aroma, with delicate honey notes dancing in the background and a very dry, crisp yeast bite on the end. Light minerals, appropriate to the style, from the yeast, but not overdone. Nor is there any trace of anything unauthentic here. I sometimes feel that hallertauer hops lose out to styrian goldings in their combination of dryness/snappiness and aroma/flavor (styrian having both the dryness AND the more complex flavor), but not so here. This is like the most lush and fertile grass, soft and fuzzy but at the same time poignant and crisp. And that’s just the aroma. The flavor struck me right away as, well, a Bohemian pils. You sort of keep in the back of your head a model of what the perfect example of a style would taste like. This came really close. The hops are about 90% flavor and 10% bittering, just leaving enough bitterness to help aid the yeast in clearing the light malt. They are fully dry, wonderfully grassy and almost fruity, they seem so fresh. Must have been a freshly harvested batch of hops. The malt is medium-light to light in texture, without being watery or too lean, yet at no time does it assert dominance or build up on the palate. Warm honey and very slight baked dough notes, provide a substantial medium on which to display the hops. The attenuation is perfect as well, not being too dry as to get bready or papery, and having enough sweetness to fend back yeast-derived acidity. And last but not least, the yeast on the finish might be even more stunning than the hops. It’s full of that mineral-like lager yeast bite that is so charming about this style. Crisp and snappy, finishing dry and urging another sip. Supremely drinkable, no brewing flaws. Tough to critique this one. I suppose the carbonation, while not poorly represented here, just dosent have what a tight, bottle conditioned carbonation has. This one is a touch loose at times. The aroma, while chalk full of hops, could, perhaps stand a touch more malt nuance, while maybe you could have a more robust maltiness (though it’s difficult to do so without messing up the balance). I’m reaching though. It’s hard to ask for much more than this.
McKenzie Belgian Pale Ale;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - Belgian;McKenzie Brew House;Draft: Dull yellow. Dusty-white whisp of head. Soft fruity yeast, juicy hop aroma topped with flowers and delicately sweet malt. Fuzzy, lightly prickly carbonation. Sweet malt flavors followed up with chalky yeast and earthy hops. Flower petals, peach, and herbs linger alongside muted malt sweetness and chalky yeast. While certainly passable, this would improve tenfold if it were bottle-conditioned.
McKenzie Belgian Pale Ale;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - Belgian;McKenzie Brew House;"Sample at the brewpub. Light golden, hazy; very light, pleasant, yeasty nose. Great sweet/dry balance, bit of clove, cinnamon, caramel, banana. Nice."
McKenzie Belgian Pale Ale;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - Belgian;McKenzie Brew House;Poured a golden color with a small white head that quickly diminished, but left sparce lacing. Aroma of yeast, citrus hops, and a clove spiciness as well. Dry and yeasty taste, was mildly hoppy and citrusy, but finished very earthy. Medium bodied, and very refreshing.
McKenzie Belgian Pale Ale;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - Belgian;McKenzie Brew House;Dark golden color, nice bubbly white head, spicy hoppy nose, excellent balance, great mixture of a Belgian ale with the sweet maltiness with the hoppiness of an APA, very enjoyable & drinkable, a great session beer
McKenzie Luscious Lemon Lager;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McKenzie Brew House;Not really that great of a beer, more like a palate cleanser than a beer, actually more like lemon water to sober you up, clear golden color, very little head, lemon in the nose, way too much lemon the flavor (although that may be attributed to the fact that a lemon was laying on top of the beer for a while), not very drinkable
Lunar Moon Over Brabant Ale;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Lunar Brewing Company;Previewed in a Czech-pils glass before the official tapping. Poured a clear, bright amber hue with a soft white, frothy head, and clingy, curtainy rings of lacing. The aroma offered an initial hint of yeast, then subtle, biscuity malt, light fruit, and a touch of sweetness. The flavor added some nice spicy hints to the mix. A clean, refreshing, and totally sessionable brew. Recently on tap again at the brewpub, and shaker served this time, presenting a very mild nose with light grain & toastiness, and not much in the way of esters or sweetness. However, I really appreciated the moderate hop bitterness and light peppery phenols that lingered smoothly throughout the flavor and into the finish, thus generating a nice crispness. Medium bodied, decently carbonated, and still very sessionable.
Lunar Moon Over Brabant Ale;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Lunar Brewing Company;This poured a hazy orange/amber color with a huge frothy head. The aroma is full of yeasty fruitiness and a mild malty sweetness. Quite bubbly in the mouth. Sweet, fruity, spicy to the taste. Clean, dry finish. One could easily drink a lot of these in a night. Lunar Brewing Company, Villa Park, IL
Lunar Moon Over Brabant Ale;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Lunar Brewing Company;The Brabant Ale that I am drinking is somewhat hazy and copper in color. It poured with an average head that dissipated early in the pint. The aroma is a combination of mango, orange, and beachwood. I detect a hint of saaz hop spicyness. There is some malt character. It has a fresh wort quality, yet still fully attenuated for a nice dry, somewhat fuity finish. Overall this beer reminds me of the fresh quality beer you might get at a non comercial Belgian farm house brewery.

Gaslight The Eliminator;South Orange, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Gaslight Brewery & Restaurant;Strong brew, 10% ABV for the record. Very clear beer, not a very pleasing taste.

Gaslight The Eliminator;South Orange, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Gaslight Brewery & Restaurant;Draft at the brewery. Pours a golden ale with a white head. Aroma is spring fruit, citrus, banan, some chocolate malt. Etoh is very present in this beer that dries your palate out as you finish.
Gaslight The Eliminator;South Orange, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Gaslight Brewery & Restaurant;6.2.06 Tap at the brewpub. Decent. Kind of heavy for a doppelbock. More like a syrupy dubbel or triple than a doppel.
Gaslight The Eliminator;South Orange, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Gaslight Brewery & Restaurant;Smells, looks, and tastes like a tripel. Sweet. I think it is underrated here. Honey.

Cerveza C-Coviran;Barcelona, Spain;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Damm;Copenhagen 27/3 2016. 33 cl can brought home from Tenerife. Purchased at Coviran supermarket in Los Cristianos. Paranoid looking horse on the can looking quite uncomfortable by being figurehead for this supermarket beer. Pours clear pale yellow with white head. Settles as thin layer of foam. Aroma is pretty bland. Wet cardboard, bread and boredom. Prickly carbonation and watery palate. The most positive thing I can say about the flavor is that it is not overly sweet. The problem is that it does not taste of much. Only light sweetness and bitterness. You could argue that a beer that does not taste of anything would be fine for food. But then again - so would a glass of water.

Isotopes Slammin Amber;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Isotopes Brewing;Glass at an airport restaurant in Albuquerque. Rating 10 to make this one count. Dark amber pour with a coarse unattractive head of mottled color. Vegetal nose, caramel malt, and a terrible industrial stale aroma. Yikes. Flavor isn’t much better. Grains dominate, plenty of caramel, sort of an ESB thing going on here, metallic hops. Drinkable because of the easy-going mouthfeel, but only just.

Isotopes Slammin Amber;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Isotopes Brewing;Amber in color, small white head. Aroma is malty, flavor is a bit sweet. Decent amber ale, superior to the Isotopes AAA Blonde. Best beer you can get at the stadium.
Isotopes Slammin Amber;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Isotopes Brewing;From notes 9/2006. Pours amber of course. I was surprised at how much I liked this brew. While I can’t say it will be an all time favorite, it would definitely be the type that I would get for a weekend or a party or something along those lines. The flavor has a somewhat sweet edge to it that never drops off and stays constant. The body is thicker with a heavy tone to it. This isn’t a cheap brew and actually tastes well. I will say thought that I am sure it’s quality has a lot to do with the fact that it is locally brewed and I bought it about 5 miles away from the brewery.

Aroma of sweet roasted malt with a touch of bitter hops. Flavor of roasted, burnt malt with a sweet vanilla finish. Plenty of bitter hops as well.

Bru Double Chocolate Porter;Rochester, New York, United States;Porter;Bru;On tap at brewery: This porter looked very promising to me. It was very dark brown, almost a black, very thick, and had a small tan head to it. The aroma was dominated by roasted malt flavors, lots of darker malt smells. Tasted very roasty, bitter, with just the slightest of chocolate flavors. I would have loved this to be a little more complex in terms of the roasted taste, perhaps adding some more bittersweet chocolate and caramel flavors to balance it out. My favorite one of the day there.

Gaslight Perfect Stout;South Orange, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Dry;Gaslight Brewery & Restaurant;Dark brown pour with tan head and lace. A smell of a plugged kitchen drain.

Socorro Springs Box Canyon Bock;Socorro, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Socorro Springs Brewing (no longer brewing - see Eddyline);Copper body. Nutmeg jumps out of this one.

Light spicy taste with some nice roasted character throughout. Smooth medium body. Good balance of malt sweetness. Some nuttyness way late in the finish.
CooperSmiths Highland Scottish Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;The Highland Scottish Ale poured a copper-red. It had a thick, creamy light tan head that was very nitro-like. It had excellent retention and laced the glass. The aroma was some caramel malt and a little fruitiness. It had a velvety, creamy mouthfeel. The taste was of caramel, toffee and toasted chocolate malt. It had a very subtle hop bitterness - could have used some more. Overall, this a a nice beer. I probably would have loved this not too long ago. Now, it seems a little too one-sided on the malt side.
Freeminer Gold Standard;Cinderford, Gloucestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Freeminer;Anaranjada, turbia. Un dedo de espuma. Aroma poco agradable, un poco a sudor. En boca no, afortunadamente. Sabor lupulado y seco, con toque de naranja y final muy amargo.
Freeminer Gold Standard;Cinderford, Gloucestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Freeminer;Bottle from the Coop. Appearance - golden with a thin head. Nose - caramel, some lemon on the finish but dominated by sweet notes. Taste - more of the same. Palate - light to medium bodied with a creamy texture and a finish that could really be a lot fresher. Overall - when a beer is light bodied the least it should do is refresh but this doesn’t.
Freeminer Gold Standard;Cinderford, Gloucestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Freeminer;Bright amber with white head. Nice looking beer, poured well. Spicy, coriander seed notes in the aroma and flavour with a sweetish malt base, perhaps a little too challenging for a long beer. The hops last the distance with a few honeyish and green nuances but just couldn’t lose the overwhelming peppery notes.
Freeminer Gold Standard;Cinderford, Gloucestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Freeminer;(Bottle). Rather unpleasant aroma of sour malt, urine and grassy hops. Taste of malt and grassy hops. The aftertaste is sour with a rather dull bitterness. This is a bad beer!

Baron Pils (Netherlands);Lieshout, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Bottle from dEnk, thanks? Pale golden color, thin white head that even leaves some lacing. Aroma of cardboard and cheap ingredients, flavor of glue and more cardboard. Ugly.

Becketts Porterquack SwanSupping;Basingstoke, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Becketts Brewery;Bottle conditioned. Amber orange, good white but shortlived head and good condition. Pleasantly complex aromas of chocolate, hops, citrusy orange and fleeting melon notes. More chocolate and fruity malt in the mouth with a nuttiness that veered towards coconut before turning to roasted hazelnuts in the bitter finish. Bags of flavour for a 4% beer.
Legend Stout (USA);Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout;Legend Brewing Company;Bottle shared by ucusty. Nose is roasty, char, coffee. FLavor has some pretty nice roast with a finish of cream and cappachuino. Good, solid, stout without any major flaws.
Legend Stout (USA);Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout;Legend Brewing Company;Thanks to ucusty for sharing this one at the CC gathering! Another solid brew from this modest brewery. Deep dark chocolate pour, with a moderate head, decent retention. While the aroma is dominated by roasted malts, the flavor has some tart fruit in it that doesn’t always complement the primary characteristic &#40could be signs of infection too&#41. Understated and enjoyable, just not too memorable.
Legend Stout (USA);Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout;Legend Brewing Company;Dark brown pour pour tan head and spotty lace. Roasted malts, light chocolate and buttery aroma. Thin bodied. Chocolate, hazelnut, and light roast. Solid regular stout
Legend Stout (USA);Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout;Legend Brewing Company;Bottle shared by ucusty. Thanks, Dave. Dark brown pour. Creamy tan head. Nose is roasty, meaty even. Some chocolate and coffee. Something kind of stale about it... cardboard notes suggest oxidation. Still, not too bad.
Legend Stout (USA);Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout;Legend Brewing Company;Thanks ucusty for sharing. Pours a dark brown that allows light. Head is two fingers thick creamy and tan. The nose is chocolaty, some coffee, sweet, papery. Flavor is thin, slick, papery, peanut shells, old hops. Thin ashy palate.
Legend Stout (USA);Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout;Legend Brewing Company;"Pitch black, 100% opaque with a nice sized light brown head. Great aroma of chocolate, dough, bread - kind of like chocolate chip cookie dough. Very nice with a lactic twang - a great smelling beer for sure! Medium-bodied; Nice bready & chocolatey taste with some malt and roastyness very noticeable. Aftertaste bitter, but a lot of sweetness bodes well on the palate. Overall, a good stout - I can’t believe this is a Legend! Especially after the last beer (Legend Doppelbock), its tough to compare the two. I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Norm’s in Vienna, Virginia on 09-June-2005 at Jon(R888710)’s."
Legend Stout (USA);Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout;Legend Brewing Company;Bomber, split with NachlamSie. Pours quite black with a long-lasting tan head. The aroma is slight smoke, chocolate, a little bit of soy sauce, some dark fruits, and a little coffee. The flavor is chocolate, ash, a little smoke, and some fruit peels. Finish is surprisingly dry considering the fullness of the body. Not bad.
Legend Stout (USA);Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout;Legend Brewing Company;Bomber coutresy of Tronraner. Pours fairly dark, near black with some reds in the light. Nice head on this one which is accompanied by solid lacing. The aroma is on the fruitier side of stouts. Plums, meat, caramel, rum, lightly roasted coffee. Taking a sip, I discovered my biggest peeve with this beer: its thin mouthfeel. It’s not very spritzy nor is it heavy, so it feels a lot like water which doesn’t lend itself much to the overall flavor profile. That aside, it tastes pretty decent. Nothing really jumps out at me, but I get more bashful flirtations with fruit, clear rum, and a bit of buttered bread. The finish is dryish with tame spices. Cumin comes to mind, maybe something else meaty. I thought it was all right and could’ve been much better with a denser palate.
Legend Stout (USA);Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout;Legend Brewing Company;22oz. Pours black with a tan head. Not getting much out of the nose, mostly the slightest hint of roasteds. Body is heavy and lends itself to coffee, but more burnt coffee than anything else. Also, dirt. Finish is long but not necessarily enjoyable. No complexity. I am increasingly underwhelmed with Legend.
Legend Stout (USA);Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout;Legend Brewing Company;22 oz from Whole Foods Charlottesville. Pours chocolate brown with a small, persistent toffee colored head. Earthy mocha aroma. Taste is mocha up front with a minimal yet bad hop character in the aftertaste. Nice buttery quality to the palate. Goes down easy, but forgettable.
Legacy Euphoria;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Legacy Brewing Co.;Bottle. Pours cloudy gold with white head. Nose and taste of yeast, lemongrass, bread dough, lightly spicy malt and touch of peppercorn. Lighter medium body.
Legacy Euphoria;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Legacy Brewing Co.;"Looks dreadful for a beer that touts itself as ""Belgian-Style,"" pouring thin with very little head. Smells powerfully nondescript, like a roided-out Blue Moon. The flavor is mild yet with a spicy, yeasty finish, tart and breadlike and thankfully dry. Finishes with a brush of bitterness but primarily dough, like an unglazed doughnut eaten after sipping hot lemon water. But the texture is to die for; no trace of the alcohol can be found. None. Amazing feat for a 9-percenter. Drinks like a Spring Witbier, and makes for a good diversion on a rainy night. (3/17/09)"
Legacy Euphoria;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Legacy Brewing Co.;13th February 2009 Clear gold beer, good white head. Smooth aromatic malt with a middle note of drying spice. It then blooms briefly in to a little citrus before a sharp effervescent finish. Unusual and quite drinkable.
Legacy Euphoria;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Legacy Brewing Co.;The beer pours medium golden with a light white head. The aroma is light sweet and a bit syrupy and fruity like a Tripel is, but thin. The body of the beer is very thin as well, disappointing, but it is older. The flavors are sweet and end a bit tangy, not spicy though.
Legacy Euphoria;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Legacy Brewing Co.;Pours a nice gold with thin film. Low carbonation makes it smooth. Bottle cellared over a year. Aroma is yeast, citrus, grass and alcohol. Taste is sweet with a sticky finish. Thought this was solid.

Legacy Euphoria;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Legacy Brewing Co.;Bomber from Oak Tree. Pours light hazy amber with a 2 finger foamy white head. Aroma is primarily lightly spiced peach. Calling it as I nose it. Full bodied with creamy carbonation. The mouth feel is almost slick. The flavor is stone fruit with some yeast/spice. Citric comes forth. It is well balanced. Nice. Still sticking with the peachiness. That is not a bad thing. It drinks pretty good.
Legacy Euphoria;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Legacy Brewing Co.;Bottled. Poured a cloudy gold. Aroma is fruits and spice. A decent trip.....

Rating from notes. Pours black with a brown fizz head. Heavy roasted malt aroma with a wine fruit flavor. Vanilla flavor background, which provides the sweetness. Sweet imperial for sure. Very tasty.
Golden Valley Black Panther - Wine Barrel;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Golden Valley Brewery;"22oz bottle shared by somebody? Sat around for a little less than 24 hours. Now is the best time for me to rate this. Despite 1/3 of the bottle sitting art room temperature for a day, it still poured with a small head. Very dark brown color bur looks black. I always worry about wine barrel aging due to infections but this is completely clear of that. Nothing in sight even close. Actually, makes me question if this is barrel aged. I do not get any ""winey"" characteristics. Aroma is strong, alcohol present but not offensive. Ash, dry malts, mild cocoa and chocolate on the nose.. Flavor is mild for the nose, well attenuated, not sweet. After taste has a dry moderately bitter malt. Hops are low. Roast is low, acidity moderate for style. Silky mouthfeel. Decent stuff, nothing that I dislike in the style but also nothing that that makes me want to buy it again. A but to dry and lingering in the aftertaste. Would actually want some more sweetness and less dry malt ending."

Nimbus IPA;Tucson, Arizona, United States;IPA;Nimbus Brewing Company;Amber copper pour lacing with off white head ... aroma of hops citrusy and light sweet malt ..... taste of sweet malts, a little bready and citrusy hops .... ends with a bitter hop finish that lingers a little .... its balanced well and good for an average ipa
Nimbus IPA;Tucson, Arizona, United States;IPA;Nimbus Brewing Company;a nice amber to copper color without much head. aroma of citrisy hops and also somwhat floral. medium body and I like that it has some maltiness but is not sweet. clean dry finish.
Nimbus IPA;Tucson, Arizona, United States;IPA;Nimbus Brewing Company;Cbkschubert brought a growler of this beer to the Mesa Gathering. Malt on the nose but if you sniff like a puppy dog you will get a grapefruit aroma as well. Darker shade of copper body with thin head. Decent citrus grapefuit flavor and had more of a malt texture to it which I thout was odd. Medium body texture to body with smild bitterness. Little dry on the palate but a good refeshent as it was my first beer of the day preparing to host a beer tasteing.
Nimbus IPA;Tucson, Arizona, United States;IPA;Nimbus Brewing Company;On tap at Nimbus - They finally brewed an IPA again. The recipe is has changed a bit though. Uses Simcoe & Columbus and dry hopped with Amarillo (85 IBU). Pours a clear deep golden color with a nice head that lasts. Big citrus hop aroma and flavor. Not much malt back-up on this one. Has a lingering bitter aftertaste. It actually got better toward the bottom of the glass. Medium body. A good beer.
Nimbus IPA;Tucson, Arizona, United States;IPA;Nimbus Brewing Company;A good IPA with nice color, flavor, and aroma. It has a bitter finish, but not too overpowering. A little sweet for an IPA, making it refreshing after a hard day at work.
Nimbus IPA;Tucson, Arizona, United States;IPA;Nimbus Brewing Company;This IPA is a clear dark copper color with an off-white head that persistently keeps a thin layer floating atop the beer until the last sip. An intense fake fruity aroma wafts from my glass, a mixture of tropical fruit and perhaps some notes of Simple Green cleaner (more interesting than offensive though). The taste is hoppy, but with out a whole lot of bitterness. The fruitiness lingers in the taste with some barely perceptible diacetyl in the background that adds to the competing flavors. This is an IPA with a solid malty backbone (as is expected from Nimbus), with sweet caramelized malt notes that are accompanied by hints of lightly toasted biscuits. There is a solid bitterness in the finish, it is just muted a bit by the medium bodied fullness of this beer. The hop flavor is a combination of slightly citrusy, with a bit of tropical fruit, and a hint of pine. This beer is definitely on the sweet side, but it is a good foil for the hops.
Caffrey's Irish Stout;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Stout - Dry;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);"Rated from old notes from the 90s. Creamy head that fades quickly in the canned version; watery body. Dark with a cloying sweet and rich taste. Seems rather flat despite evident carbonation.

Gulf Islands Saturna Island Extra Stout;Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Gulf Islands Brewery (Salt Spring Island Ales);Had this at Moby's on Saltpring Island. They called it Salty Isle Stout, but I'm pretty sure it's the same beer. This was definitely the best of the brews I've had from this brewery. Pitch black in colour with a thick and creamy dark brown head. Huge coffee aroma with hints of molasses. Wonderfully creamy texture with coffee flavour, faint fruitiness and an intensely bitter finish that lasts and lasts. Bitterness seems to come from astringency of the grains and from the presence of hops. Very good brew.

Aroma is slightly chocoatey and a bit of savoury (soy sauce). Roasty malt. Taste is very smooth, touch of vanilla creaminess (chocolate milk maybe) but not that sweet. Savoury tang to it. Initial bitterness but then very creamy finish. Think I am a sucker for Schwarzbier.

Banfield No 1 Sweet Stout;Royston, Hertfordshire, England;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Buntingford Brewery;Cask Conditioned at The Tally Ho, Barkway. Black beer with a bubbly malty head. Confused, this is a Buntingford Brewery beer, which is currently being relocated. While a new Brewery is being set up the beer is being brewed by Belvoir under the name of Banfield Ales, Steve Banfield has rated some beers on this site. This is a light, sweet mild ale with litle bite. Heavily sweetened, I note by lactose so presumably more of a milk stout. The Tally Ho was a devil to find, with some interesting locals who are keen to give strangers misleading directions. Don't go on a dark stormy night.

Pale, beer looking beverage with minimal aroma and almost no taste. Quite remarkable achievement to have such watery blandness in something that looks like beer.

Archers Chocoholic;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Mild Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cash : Brewery Tap, Wimbledon. Poured black, and what looked quite thin in consistancy. It tasted of chocolate but lacked any body at all( my suspicion is chocolate essence instead of chocolate malt) It was much the same as The Meantime version. Drinkable all the same
Archers Chocoholic;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Mild Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Handpump at the Crescent, Salford 23/04/2004 Dark slightly fruity and very smooth on the palate. Slight bitterness, roast malt and a chocolaty finish
Archers Chocoholic;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Mild Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Handpump At The Cricketers,Ipswich.Dark chestnut in colour,small head,milky aroma,some malt flavour,I missed the chocolate.
Archers Chocoholic;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Mild Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);JDW, Rochester. An almost black beer of little noticable aroma. Light bodied with raspberry notes and a chocolate ghost in the finish. A rather dull mild.
Archers Chocoholic;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Mild Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask conditioned - handpump - Head Of Steam euston. A black beer with hints of ruby and an off-white head. Good chocolate notes in the aroma and chocolate malt tastes. A malty pleasant beer.
Archers Chocoholic;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Mild Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask conditioned at the Head of Steam, Euston, London. I would probably have called this a mild. Slight chocolate (chocolate malt rather than actual chocolate), roasty malt, slightly sweet, somewhat tasty but no means a great beer.
Archers Chocoholic;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Mild Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Dark brown with a tan head. Chocolate and more chocolate aroma. Very toasty and dry. A generous proportioned ale. Very nice indeed.
Archers Chocoholic;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Mild Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Archers! Don't ya just love 'em? New beer every week. What would old McSpoons do without Archers, eh? But, give the boys credit - they can actually put together a decent drop. This is an interestingly chocolately stout. Not top drawer, but - bless their little brewing mittens - not bad.
Archers Chocoholic;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Mild Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask-conditioned @ JDW. Roasty aroma. Slighty vinous with aniseed flavours. Too thin. Not much chocolate, a chocoholic would be sorely disappointed.
Archers Chocoholic;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Mild Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Hand pulled at The Anchor, Birmingham. Lovely dark appearance, akin to black leather, scarce lacing and a persistent cappucino topping. Aromatic dark chocolate stench. Bounces on the tongue like Wayne Sleep. Quite rounded and oily. All in all fantastic (MJP).
Weatheroak Easter Whisky Stout;Studley, Warwickshire, England;Stout;Weatheroak Brewery;Hand pulled at the Anchor, Birmingham. Soapy lacing, no head. I couldn't smell the whiskey here, or really taste it as such, but there is a distinct, slightly medicinal quality. Smooth, refreshing and oily, with a slight hoppiness to finish. Fairly full too. Good stuff.
Tenaya Creek Dunkel Weisse;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Amber color with a firm foamy yead. Pungent brown sugar aroma. Smooth but acidic, with sweet flavors and burnt caramels. Little to no yeastiness.
Tenaya Creek Dunkel Weisse;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Sweet malt nose. Some head with good lacing. Some malt in the body but a little thin for me. The texture starts creamy and then turns chalky. No very good.
Tenaya Creek Dunkel Weisse;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Tenaya Creek Brewery;on tap at brewpub: this was the first beer i drank at tenaya creek on recomendation of the bartender. plus i thought this was one that sounded the best for a seasonal. poured in an ice cold frozen glass, killing any aroma and taste the beer had. hazy tan-brown color with a small tan head that disipated. no aroma, kept trying to find it but mostly smelled like a damp towel, nothing. the taste was mostly of malt, crystal sweet with some hoppy overtones in the finish. some kind of an off flavor, cant quite pinpoint it. reminded me of some of my homebrews that went the wrong direction but you could still drink it with a perplexed look and wonder where you went wrong. weird brew. definately didnt remind me of the class at all. surprising because they make a legit hefe, add some higher lovibond or darker malts and you should be able to get what your after??? i wish this would have worked, could have been good.
Milly Rebelle;Milly sur Thérain, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie de Milly / Cidrerie G. Maeyaert;"25 cl bottle at a local restaurant in Caulières. I may have misunderstood this beer altogether but its advertising - as opposed to its label - mentions it being ""viellié au mure"", which I think is supposed to mean barrel-aged. If so it might be a really authentic bière de garde. Even so, it’s mucky and musty tasting in a not nice way."
Milly Rebelle;Milly sur Thérain, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie de Milly / Cidrerie G. Maeyaert;Bue 1 mois avant DLC chez Milinf. Bière blonde avec énormément de dépôt en suspension (comme un voile qui n’augure rien de bon).Gros col de mousse blanche à grosse bulle à tenue moyenne. Arôme léger de miel. En bouche, très sucrée avec un final très clairement orienté sur le miel (mais il n’y en a pas dedans ??). L’impression de boire une bière avec 5 cuillères de miel dedans : trop sucrée !! A côté de ça, bière très spéciale avec un petit goût que je ne sais décrire (cidre mais sans acidité ?). Bref, originale ce qui fait que je lui donne un 11 malgré le reste.
Milly Rebelle;Milly sur Thérain, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie de Milly / Cidrerie G. Maeyaert;Décevante. Relativement plate, dominée par une certaine acidité. Fort dépôt dans le fond de la bouteille

Cottage Breast Bitter;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Tried at the market porter. Okay i tried this because of the picture....when there’s nine other beers to try the one with the boobs on the pump clip will get my attention every time....anything to take the attention away from the barmaids weird pink jeans and muffin top! Amazing nose on this, probably the strongest malty nose i’ve ever had, delicious! 5/5 for appearance because it looked good and so did the clip...flavour was malt driven but lacked the hops to really balance it but not a bad beer.
Cottage Breast Bitter;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask conditioned at The Woolpack, Banbury. Brown amber with slight white head. Rick told me that he thought the person on the phone had said ’Best Bitter’, oh yeah. Dull, malty bitter, sweetish, a little cloying, not one thing in particular stands out. A bit of a booby this one.
Cottage Breast Bitter;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask Handpump at the Cross Keys, Knutsford 10/04/2001 Smooth on the palate with plenty of malt present.
Cottage Breast Bitter;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask-conditioned @ JDW, Soton. Creamy, nutty aroma with a hint of wort. Slightly sweet with creamy bitter finish. Creamy and drinkable but unsatisfying.
Cottage Breast Bitter;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Breast! Oh ho ho ho... Hand pulled at The Anchor, Birmingham. Smells like stale milk. A grey/brown colour, with a reasonable head. A very foody taste - egg or batter mix, or maybe cake mixture. Some caramel too. Very smooth transition from front to back - no dryness or hops, just sweet and lilting. OK, but rather cloying.
Hobdens Wessex Merrie Mink;Longbridge Deverill, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wessex Brewery;Cask handpull at Brew Wharf, London, 20 June 2008. Sherberty hop aroma which I like. Odd bleachy flavour in mouth and finish, which I didn’t. Bit of ginger? Some diacetyl even. If it wasn’t for the sherberty hop, I’d throw it away. It’s oddly ok? No, it’s pants.
Hobdens Wessex Merrie Mink;Longbridge Deverill, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wessex Brewery;Hand pulled at The Anchor, Birmingham. Light brown colour, with a grassy aroma and no head or lacing. Well balanced beer, with an increasingly dry and bitter finish. Refreshing with generous bite. A hoppy and light experience.
Stonehenge LTS (Lunch Time Special);Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stonehenge Ales;I didn’t expect too much from this beer, but I was surprised. An excellent balance of maltiness and bitter hops which meld well in the attractive hoppy finish. Very good, especially for the ABV. (Cask @ Worcester Beer Festival)
Stonehenge LTS (Lunch Time Special);Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stonehenge Ales;"Hand pulled at The Anchor, Birmingham. Looks like lager, with a very loose head, and some sloppy lacing. Tastes as expected, like a light pale ale. Summery on the intake, some hops to finish. All a bit blah really, I feel like saying ""what's the point?"""
Corner Pub Red Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Had about a 7 oz glass of this a couple of weeks ago at the Corner Pub. Wasn’t nearly as good as the Cream Ale. Served with a small, tan head that quickly settled out and a bit of lace. Color was clear amber/red. Aroma was a little roasty mild malt. Flavor was the same and some caramel with a bit of hop. Body was watery and had sharp carbonation. Short finish. Forgettable.
Corner Pub Red Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;On draught at the Corner Pub in Reedsburg, Wisconsin. Pours a clear golden pale brew with a thick white creamy head that slowly dissolves and leaves behind an excellent lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrusy hops and a touch of roasted nuts. Taste is medium bodied, very light carbonated with a semi-sweet flavor of caramel malt and some citrus hops. Finish is semi-sweet a slight biscuity aftertaste with a very light metalic bitterness.
Corner Pub Red Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Light Gold Coloring with White Head. Basically the Old Gold Lager Without the Candy Sugar Taste.
Corner Pub Red Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;"Again... how can the ""Red"" be gold in color? Aroma of caramel. The taste turns sour, but at least retains the halfway decent caramel."
Corner Pub Red Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Translucent yellow-gold in color with a solid, icy, thin white head. Sweet malts in the aroma, joining potatoes, hazelnuts, pumpernickel and baguette yeast. First flavor impression: watery. Moments later: pecans. It goes without saying that the most admirable flavor traits manifest in the finish. Somewhat chalky and palate stinging with a harsh lemon acidity. Part of me wants to welcome this beer. The other 90 percent won’t hear of it.
Corner Pub Red Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Amber to bronze in color. Smaller beige head. Hopsack, mild malt and an english yeast aroma. Lightly sweet malt flavors coupled with vanilla, floral hops, and balanced with a dry nuttiness and a sharp hops acidity. The hops acidity in the end does make this one feel a bit thinner. Lingering bitterness.
Goose Island Dead Goat Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Dark brown color with a smaller tan head. Aromas of dark chocolate, caramel and touch of dough. Flavors start fairly sweet with caramel and nutty malt. Middle added chocolate and darker malts. Finish stays a bit on the sweet side with a black malt bitterness. The goat still lives!
Goose Island Dead Goat Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at the Wrigleyville brewpub before a Cubs game. Pours dark reddish brown with a beige head that disappears without a trace. Aroma is roasty coffee and malt with a little chocolate. Flavor loses a little of the coffee. Thin bodied with an astringent roasty finish.
Goose Island Dead Goat Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);CASK!!!! at goose ...

Goose Island Dead Goat Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at GI. Dark brown pour with an off white head. The first thing I smelled was a good bit of roast, followed by an odd charcoal aroma and some light chocolate. Flavor was quite toasty and lacked much of a body. Way too thin for me.
Goose Island Dead Goat Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Brown. White head. Herbal hops in the nose. Malty chocolaty nose. Light body with a dry finish.
Goose Island Dead Goat Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at clybourn. Dark brown almost opaque black with small beige head. Subtle smokey aroma with dry roasted malt. Flavor is smokey with some raspberry/raisin, prune, some roast, sweet, yeasty. Mediun to light body with light carbonation. Interesting, I don’t know if I am completely into but sessionable.
Goose Island Dead Goat Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);i was forewarned and drank it anyways. this was truly terrible. i don’t how they pulled it off but it tasted like the bottom of an ashtray. i couldn’t even finish half of it. i couldn’t believe how bad this tasted.
Goose Island Dead Goat Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draught at Goose Island Tavern, Chicago, Illinois. An okay porter that poured a rich brown colour and the aroma of caramel. It had well-balance flavours of spice, malt and hops though it was a bit too thin for me.
Goose Island Dead Goat Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draught at the Goose Island Tavern, Wrigleyville, Chicago. A decent if standard porter with some nice chocolate and earthy characteristics. The palate is a bit thin and it was typically served too cold -- although the complexity of the flavours emerged somewhat when it had the chance to warm slightly.
Goose Island Dead Goat Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at GI Clybourn. Poured a clear dark brown color with a light tan head. Some orange light came through around the edges of the glass. Aroma was of light roasty malt, chocolate, and a hint of cola. Medium to full bodied and sweet. Carbonation was on the low end of the spectrum. There were toffee and chocolate flavors with delicate roasty malt in the background. I didn’t get much of any hop flavor. Pretty good stuff, but they may need to up the octane in order to help the Cubs.
Town Hall Cabernet Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Light palate for a stout. Not sure if it was made like that or if the barrel did something to it. Anyway, dark coloured with a nice light roasted malt aroma with some tiny hints of oak. The flavour has obvious hints of wine and it adds a lot of character. I really liked this but would have liked it to be a bit creamier.
Town Hall Cabernet Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;A nice beer, more flavorful than the merlot stout. Aroma has oak and roasted malt. Flavor is medium sweet malt, oak, and light vinous character. Very dark brown. But as Oslo stated, the palate is lacking.
Town Hall Cabernet Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On cask at the brew pub. Dark brown body with creamy brown head. Chocolate nose with wine like characteristics. Smooth creamy body with a sweet finish and a dry wine characteristic. One of the best they’ve done in a while.
Town Hall Cabernet Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;CASK: Black Color with Tan Head. Dark Malt and Dry Cabernet Wine Aroma. Smooth and Creamy Body. Light Bodied Stout Foundation. Lightly Sweet and Malty...Some Light Roasts..Cabernet Comes Out Right After the Initial Taste Hits Your Tongue...This Brew Ends Sweet and Dry. The Cabernet Addition is Amazing. Not Overpowering, It’s Just Right and Mixes with the Stout Wonderfully. I Could Think of Few Things Better then Going Pint After Pint with This Beer.
Town Hall Cabernet Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Almost black shade of brown from the cask. Tannic aroma, hint of chocolate. Cabernet flavors of raisin and salted dry fruit, sort of pungent and almost sweaty, give way to a juice concentrate sugar taste. Smooth and round palate with a dry, bitter aftertaste. Seems to highlight the more unfortunate characteristics of wine barrel aging - this time around it could maybe have spent a little less time in there.
Town Hall Cabernet Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;As a devotee of Ireland's famous black, roasty ale, I've enjoyed stouts in uncounted variations, with myriad twists and turns, melded, mixed and married with numerous fruits, spices, berries, vegetables,nuts, beans, etcetera. So, why was I surprised by this new cask offering, why is my imagination so puny as to never predict this interesting take on the style? That's why there are brewers like Hoops, and pubs like Town Hall! Color is a full brown, reddish around the edges, with a tidy creamy tan head atop. Aroma is soft, creamy, with light fruitiness, and just the start of a suggestion of the work of the vine that has permeated and blended so mellifulously with this ale. (I never asked exactly how they created this masterpiece, I merely drank and enjoyed!) Once on the mouth, pure pleasure, nothing but. Nothing really stands out, not a part steps forward, but what you have is an fine, if rudimentary stout, with the soft, sweet, but still dry-ish, and very mellow cabernet flavorings riding underneath, and coating the mouth. The combination is supreme! This is an interesting idea, magnificently executed...hops are mild, malt is lush and luxuriant, and the finish is a never-ending delight. Texture smooth and wonderful, flavor is a consistent joy! If this were bottled, it would set the world on fire! I'd have it by my side at every occasion I could and wave it around for all to see. (As I did last night at the anniversary party). One fantastic beer! Another triumph for Town Ha

Corner Pub Milk Stout;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;On tap at the Wisconsin Micro-Brewer’s Beer Fest. Poured near black with a well-retained cap of tan head. The aroma picked up sweet chocolate, black patent, and molasses maltage, giving an excellent impression.. no real hop presence was noted.. some lactic sweetness on the back. The flavor found a blend of sweeter and slightly darker chocolates joined by milky caramel and molasses.. light earth and toasted nutty accents.. finished with tasty residual sugars. Medium-bodied and well-carbonated on the palate with near-perfect balance.. probably my favorite beer of the day!
Corner Pub Milk Stout;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Growler from Skyview. I’ll admit to being a bit gunshy based on prior experience with this brewpub. Black color with no head. Aroma of milk that is just starting to turn. Tons and tons of milk and dry lactose flavor. Big oats wallop. Roastiness is buried. May be over the top for a milk stout, but it works very well. Damn fine turnaround for this place!
Corner Pub Milk Stout;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Sweet. I can taste the lactose. Black beer, and lightly roasted malt flavor. Much too light, but it is sweet enough.
Corner Pub Milk Stout;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;"On draught at the brewpub in Reedsburg, Wisconsin. Pours a near opaque dark brown brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that leaves behind a fine film and off-white ring. Hardly any lacing in glass. Aroma of dark roasted malt, some flowery hops, molasses, dark bittersweet chocolate and a touch of coffee. Taste is full bodied, light carbonation, and a very high sweet flavor. The lactose is over-powering and could just barely taste the dark malt and chocolate flavors. Finish is just as sweet as the flavor with a candi sugar aftertaste. This has to be the ""sweetest"" milk stout I’ve ever encountered."
Corner Pub Milk Stout;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Silky opaque black with a smaller tna head. Aromas of dark berries and roasted malts.

Goût : Torréfaction du malt et du café, malt grillé, touche de lactose (?), cendre en rétro-olfaction. Amertume moyenne, sucre faible. Sensation : Corps moyen-faible, longueur moyenne, effervescence moyenne. Bref : Bonne stout qui met plus l'accent sur le côté torréfié, grillé, amer que sur celui sucré, ce qui n'est pas mauvais. Elle manque par contre de corps, handicapant l'ensemble de la dégustation à mon avis.

Yukon Midnight Sun Espresso Stout;Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada;Stout;Yukon Brewing;Deep black in color. Smell has a lot of coffee to it, with some cocoa notes. The taste is more in the espresso realm with a not-quite burnt taste. There's a good level of malty sweetness, too. It certainly hit the goal. It's drinkable, bht not delicious. Though maybe It's just not a style suited for me.

Lake Placid Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;I really enjoyed this beer.

Lake Placid Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;En fût. Pinte dégustée à la brasserie. Arôme: Odeur d’agrumes et d’épices. Apparence: La couleur est paille légèrement voilée avec une faible densité de bulle. Présence d’un mince col mousseux et d’une fine dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Goût d’agrumes et d’épices avec une pointe de banane. Durée moyenne de l’arrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture légèrement huileuse. Moyenne effervescence en bouche. L’arrière goût est légèrement citronné. (Rating #1058)
Lake Placid Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;Bottom Line: Milky coriander and pale malt sweetness precede the lemony spiciness in this decent, and rather sweet Belgian Witbier. Further Personal Perceptions: -A frail veil of foam hangs on to the hazy pale yellow. -The nose is more compelling than the flavor profile, clearly building the beer’s actual spices into the yeast’s esters. -A cereal return in the aftertaste makes it interesting, although some might say it doesn’t finish dry enough to really be quenching. -Body is quite lean and drinkable. -Spiciness is not as flavorful as the nose indicated, but still present. -The yeast from Achouffe tends to add an olden, dusty character to the finish. -The lemony fruitiness fits with the sweet maltiness. On tap at the brewpub.
Lake Placid Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;07.13.05 Tap at brewpub. Bright and clear golden, large white head fades to ring. Strong spiced aroma, corriander, lots of clove. Belgie-type wit yeast, fair citrus is old and orange rind-ish.

Lake Placid Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;Growler. Aroma is very citrusy--orange peels and cleanser-like aroma. It’s quite pleasant though. Pour is a darker yellow with a nice fluffy white head with just the mildest haziness. I’m used to these being paler in color with more haziness. Start has notes of orange peels, which is then followed by some big hoppy bitterness. Finishes creamy and sweet with a bit of malts. Adequate carbonation. An inteesting take on a Wit...used to these being a bit more mellow.

Pours a clear blonde with a generous white head. Very strong aroma, smells like a Yankee Candle...banana, citrus, licorice. Huge licorice flavor to begin with, too much in my opinion. The middle cleans out and ends very sweet. Some more of the typical white beer flavors to end with. This needs a bit more re-tooling to be a good brew.

Baeren Classic;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baeren;Bottiglia. Il gusto al naso viene attratto dall'orzo. L'intensità olfattiva è normale e la maniera in cui permane è sufficiente. Il mantello birroso superiore resiste abbastanza. La grandezza delle bollicine è a grana fine.

La forza gustativa è elevata e la persistenza è buona. Il gusto è piacevole. Le sensazioni boccali finali risultano di birra beverina. Il finale è amarognolo. Il retrogusto è intenso.

Baeren Classic;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baeren;Izakaya Juraku, NYC bottle: pours gold with white head. Aroma is malty, bready, light grass. Taste is lightly bitter, malty. OK.
Baeren Classic;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baeren;Bottle. Malty nose, with rich and concentrated stone fruit, some grass, and a little citrus. Bright gold/amber color, with slight chill haze. Moderately sweet malt, strong stone fruitiness, caramel, bread. The mid palate bitterness saves it from becoming cloying. Finish is a bit sweet, but overall it’s balanced. Medium body. Great malty stuff. A bit heavy and full-flavored for the style.
Baeren Classic;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baeren;"330ml bottle bought at LY Drinks & Bites’s booth at HKCEC in Wan Chai during HKTDC Food Expo 2016. Looks: Clear golden orange colour; One quarter finger head with residual soapy white foam which fades in 20 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with near zero carbonation. Aroma: Fragrant and intense full Lager malt, with strong sulphur, light metallic, strong lemon flesh and peels, tangerines, pepper, floral, molasses, bread and quite sharp grass. Wow! Taste: Medium to strong nice sweet full Lager malt, with strong orange, lemon, floral, molasses, light bread, medium bitter hops and grass. Body: Close to medium body. Slick and smooth palate. Mouth Feel: Strong lager maltyness in a lean but solid background. Pretty silky with every sip. The malt has that nice orangey taste which is a lot more natural and tastier than those by Suntory’s Premium Malt series. Lively lemon and grassy hop profile thanks to Burtonization (that sulphur aroma!). Sweetness is strong but very nice and tasty. The 6% booze is invisible. Excellent! Hoppiness: Strong lemon flesh and peels, pepper, floral and grass in nose. Lemon, floral, and grass in taste; Bitterness is moderate for a lasting, mid to light astringent sweet malty finish. After Taste: Fairly dry. Citrusy, sweet and fairly bitter to mouth. Comments: As a Dortmunder, this one is a very close to the style, with unmistakable Burtonized sulphur aroma and strong lemony hop taste, well attenuated with chop-licking orangey malty character, topped with clean hoppiness. Very enjoyable!"
Baeren Classic;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baeren;Bottle. Strong clear gold colour with a nice big foamy head, lots of bubbles.

Baeren Classic;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baeren;Bottle from Tanakaya. Poured into a tulip pint. Clear gold with a nice pillowy white head that leaves a nice rim around the edge throughout. Biscuity aromas present with some grain, grass and lemon along with some fruity esters. Medium to full body flavor with average carbonation. Malt really sticks out and is nice. A nice touch of sweetness, but not cloying at all. Very enjoyable.

Baeren Wit;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Baeren;"Thanks to IslandHaole for this one. Pours turbid straw with minimal head. Aroma of malt, hops, mint, parsley, chicken stock, green tea, black pepper, huge lime. Unreal aroma. One of the most singular aromas I have ever experienced, my dear Watson! Tastes malty, with some green tea, mint, and tannin overtones. Very unique taste as well. Perhaps the most ""singular"" beer I’ve ever encountered, and I mean that by no means in a negative sense, Lestrade."
Baeren Wit;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Baeren;A clear medium gold with a small white head. Normal Wit scent of corriander with some citrus. A rather flat beer, not the spritzy feel I anticipated. Some corriander flavors but a rather boring wit, toned down for Japanese palates no doubt.
Baeren Rye;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Baeren;Botella. golden brown colour with a big off-white head. Sweet aroma, wheaty rye spiced caramel, some fruit. Flavour is sweet with rye, spice, caramel, yeast, fruitish like. Very nice!
Baeren Rye;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Baeren;Sweet banana, clove, honey, egg tart. More or less the same on the palate, maybe a bit of rye, some smoke and pepper, earthy finish with a spicy edge. Not bad, but very wheat dominant, name was quite misleading to say the least.
Baeren Rye;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Baeren;Bottle from Tanakaya. Pours a slightl hazy brown with a finger of beige head. Banana bread, cloves and cinamon on the nose with some light pepper. Sweet on the palate with more banana bread really standing out. Toasted bread crust comes out on the palate. Finish has some peppery bitterness. Easy drinking. Nice original beer.
Baeren Rye;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Baeren;330 ml bottle from AEON Liquors @ Jiyugaoka. Rye beers are quite popular in Estonia, almost every new brewery tries to brew one these days. This one, however, was my first rye weizen. Poured cloudy and hazy, whitish orange with a nice top that stays. Looks like a weizen should look! Aroma reveals already the rye content of this beer - with usual banana and wheat you get also some black bread notes. Nice. It is nicely carbonated, cleans my palate well. A bit spicy, spritzy, really refreshening, having an extra bitter bite from rye I guess. This beer went down really well, even surprised me. Maybe I was thirsty also but this cold one really hit the spot.
Baeren Rye;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Baeren;Bottle from Morioka Shinkansen station. Golden coloured, opaque, small white head with tiny bubbles. Aroma is fruity, banana, wheat, spicy, and bizarrely turnips! Taste is nice, initial weizen wheat and banana, finish is bitter though, bit of ice cream and biscuits in there too. Quite interesting. Had it again today, 14/5/14. Don’t get the turnips this time but the rest still stands. Very nice beer!
Baeren Rye;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Baeren;I had seen this online and was meaning to try it so when I found a bottle at Yamaoka I picked it up! It poured a nice cloudy golden orange color with a thin head & a delicious fruity aroma of citrus, peach & spice. It also had yeast sediment which was nice. A nice full bodied ale with the rye giving it lots of spice flavors almost like a weizen but not quite as smooth. I really liked it. My wife and I drank it quickly, it hit the spot after a day at work!
Baeren Rye;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Baeren;Rated in 2009. Banana aroma. Milk coffee look, mostly milk. Very green. Light bodied. Bananabread retronasal. Do not enter
Baeren Rye;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Baeren;Draft at The Aldgate (Tokyo), a cloudy pale amber with a super foamy ice-cream head. Fruity perfume on the nose. A creamy palate with berry fruit and raw grain. Dry and tart.
Baeren Rye;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Baeren;"Golden orange with a white head. Strong wheat ale notes in the aroma. banana, clove, sweet malts, candied malts, yeast. Very full mouth. Flavor is close to a wheat. Banana, malts, yeast, light spices, and just a hint of rye. A good beer, but disappointing if you wanted some rye flavors. Why are so many ""rye"" ales lacking rye characteristics?"
Baeren Rye;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Baeren;Who doesn’t love the trash zone? great pour...pure weizen with a bit of bitterness due to the rye,,my first time for the style so I am a bit of a novice but a nice twist on a weizen
Fischer Bräu Fastenbier;Wien, Austria;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fischer Bräu;Draught: Aroma with notes of yeast, worth and grain. White, frothy head, dark yellow color. Lively carbonation. Malty/grainy and fruity flavor with hints of caramel, balanced by a pleasant hop bitterness. Long dry finish,
Fischer Bräu Fastenbier;Wien, Austria;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fischer Bräu;Draught at the brewpub. Dark golden coloured, small white head, alcoholic nose. Sweet malty, light grainy, weak hoppy and a way too strong alcoholic taste. Quite dry in the finish, but in general one-dimensional bock. 5.7%
Fischer Bräu Fastenbier;Wien, Austria;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fischer Bräu;Lovely copper coloured brew, but doesn't quite have the taste to live up to it. Quite plain malty, toffeeish and grainy flavour, some nuttiness and a bit of dryness, and a malt dominated finish with some dryness. Not a bad beer, but lacking a bit of interest. (Draught in Fischerbrau, Wien)

Apatinsko Svetlo Pivo;Apatin, Serbia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Apatinska Pivara (Molson Coors);"27-07-2017; somewhere in Београд, Србија. The looks are those of a typical Pale Lager. Golden yellow, clear, and rough white fast collapsing layer of foam. Not very special, but not bad. The smell is quite nice. It is not extremely special, but slightly stronger than that of most Pale Lagers. I like it. There are some niece almondy malt aromas, together with some lovely spicy and herbal hop aromas The hops are quit strong and nice in this one. Not bad. The taste of the beer is also quite nice. Nice full sweet and slightly biscuity malts, balanced buy some nice fresh hop flavours, some fruity and nice herbal notes. It is well balanced and nice. Great easy drinkable beer. The palate is fine. Medium light body, smooth and medium high carbonation. The finish has some nice malts and hops. All in all, quite a nice beer. Not bad."
Stein Svetlé 10%;Vyhne, Slovakia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Steiger;Die Steiger-Brauerei hat sich irgendwann die Stein-Brauerei einverleibt, produziert. Irgendwie kommt mir vor, dass man das Stein-Bier ein bisschen weniger schmackhaft macht, um die Hauptmarke zu pushen. Beim Zehngrädigen ist der Geschmackunterschied zwischen den beiden aber nicht ausmachbar. Das Stein kommt mir nur ein bisschen wässriger vor, das ist aber schon sehr subjektiv.

Wenig würzig im Mittelteil, das Bier wird insgesamt etwas milder, dadurch verwischen auch die unangenehmen Noten und das Bier wird trinkbarer. Auch im Abgang nimmt die Intensität weiter ab, es bleibt eine herbe Getreidenote, die zwar nicht unangenehm ist, sich aber dafür auf niederster Stärke abspielt. Trinkbar & unscheinbar. 5/6/6/5/4/5

Aroma is warming, bit of warm bourbon booze, not too much of it, nice balance with malty-nutty body. Caramel candy, iris candy nose with a bit of hop kick. Taste has lots of caramel, nut, marmalade and cherries. There is some booze but that doesn’t bother. Which is great.

Near what I’ll call murky, still good looking and on the top there’s a sidesticking off-white head - small lacings. Smells of dark licorice, sweet raisins and wood. Really good stuff. Just below average on the prickling carbonation level and it has a thick oily texture in the mouth. Much the same in the taste: Raisins and rum. I get wood, sweet caramel and it’s also a little salty. Superb stuff. nothing more to say. 19.06.2015

Kuhnhenn A Few Shillings Too Many;Warren, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Kuhnhenn Brewing;From notes. On draft at an “unofficial” company outing to the Clinton Township Taproom on August 08. The pour is a darker ruby brown color with a thicker tan head and a couple spots of lace as it vanishes. The aroma is strong and sweet. There is a bit of booze in this one and the malts and caramel some through pretty sweet. There is a light metallic note to this one the back end, but it’s not off-putting. A decent dark fruitiness exists, but it’s not overpowering. The flavor is much of the same. The good caramel and roasted malts work well with a light fruitiness and the hint of metallic malt returns on the back end. The mouth feel is more of a light-medium body with a softer carbonation and a lingering malty sweet finish. This is an interesting beer. 6 4 6 3 13

Kuhnhenn A Few Shillings Too Many;Warren, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Kuhnhenn Brewing;The aroma, this may sound silly, smells like when you walk into Founder’s Brewing, a bright red robust roast malt with a hint of sweet prune, and some bitter oak on the end. Appears clear dark ruby red, light caramel foam. Tastes like toffee and caramel had a drunkin threeway with a date, very sweet and warm. Feels a little oily, but generally light.

Kuhnhenn Red Run Red Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;This poured a red color with a white head. Aroma was of piney and grassyhops and toasted malt. Flavor pretty similar, not bad, but pretty boring really.
Kuhnhenn Red Run Red Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"A balanced mild citrus and sweet cereal aroma, some caramel, a hint of apple. Appears bright clear copper, swirls of off white foam. Tastes hoppy for a red, but in a good way, it brightens it up; sweet roast cereals and citrus background, finished with bitter hay. Palate is fizzy and a little oily. Overall, a very good red."
Kuhnhenn Red Run Red Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap. Very dark amber red. Decent lacing. Very subtle caramel nose. Surprisingly hoppy, a little piney. Mild caramel malt character. Great with food.
Kuhnhenn Red Run Red Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap @ Kuhnhenn: Mix between crimson & brown in color with only mild translucency at the edges. Beige-tan head settles quickly to a foamy collar. Moderate spotty lacing. Aroma of caramel, toasted bread, cocoa powder, & sticky sweet toffee. Grainy undertones with a touch of leafiness. Reminds me of a grown up Fat Tire. Flavor is amplified from the aroma. Sticky caramel, sweet toffee malts, faint vanilla, & a much bigger inclusion of hops. Mild leafy & earthy bitterness balances out a touch of back-end molasses with a finish made of caramel covered toasted nuts. Gets sweeter with time. Aside from the color, the aroma & flavor are almost more in line with a brown ale. Very malt heavy. Still pretty nice, but the pint has worn on me a little.
Kuhnhenn Red Run Red Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;On tap @ Henrik. This is a cloudy really cloudy actually deep red brown one. A small islandy off-white head on top. It has a soft woody nose with traces of dark fruits, red currant juice and some slightly unpleasant skogsbær-yogurt. Strange stuff. Oh, it’s really infected this. Lots of dark wood and lactose sourness. It’s average on the small bubbles and light oily-dry in the mouth. Clearly infected. A strange not pleasant brew. Wonder if it’s supposed to taste like this. 21.12.2013
Kuhnhenn Red Run Red Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;On tap @ Henrik, Bergen. Pours dark maroon, with a small creamy mocha head. Aroma is oak, dark fruits, berries, as well as some yeast and grain. Creamy body with light texture and soft to no carbonation. Flavour is tart on the border to sour with yeast, wood and a grainy not very fresh notes of barnyard reminiscent of acid reflux. Sweet fruity finish.

Nose is mild red fruits, rose water, hints of balsamic and grains. Taste is sour yeasty notes, balsamic, dry wooden notes, hints of grainy bread and caramel. Light to medium body, medium carbonation.

Heavyweight Golden Idol;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Opened a bottle today of this golden treasure. The brett has come through significantly after aging it for a year+. Poured cloudy and a shade under amber. Quite a bunch of foam. Aromas of funky brett with slight citrus and hints of spice. Less sweet, more dry than I remember it, guess the effect of aging. Exceptional, most OTOPs are!

Heavyweight Golden Idol;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Heavyweight Brewing Company;NJ, Pocono, Philly YEHa!’05. Thanks to willblake. Bright amber body with a uniform, sudsy grayish head. Very bretty horse blanket aroma with mild organic honey tones and an element of orange peels. Subtle, well-integrated wild yeast flavors with hay and orange qualities, low acidity, nice dryness, and moderate bitterness. I like the wild and mature layered aspects to this.
Heavyweight Golden Idol;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Thanks goes to wohlfs for sharing this at the kuhnhenns gathering on 6/10. from the bottle, poured a brown to amber with a nice off white head and some good lacing. aroma, cotton candy, yeast, bubble gum. flavor, sweet and sour, banana, yeast, floral. a very good beer

Heavyweight Golden Idol;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Bottle. Hazy opaque, light amber colore. Everlasting white head which leaves great lacing behind. Medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Residual sweetness, breadiness abound in flavor. Damn nicely done, Kudos to the Heavyweight brewery!!!!
Heavyweight Golden Idol;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Courtesy of Wohlfs. Pours murky light brown, apple cider like. Nice off-white head. Aroma has a big bubble gum presence, with some yeasty/doughy banana bread. Very carbonated. Flavor has lots of chewy banana and bubble gum, with some residuel sugar. Very nice overall.
Heavyweight Golden Idol;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Pure gold. Ornate, fully sustained blanket of pristine white foam. Thick lace. Vibrantly airy, estery nose of white pepper, lavender, and honeydew melon. Milder, but pungent, scents of brett-induced putty, dried herbs, and must. Fluffy and expansive, with a seltzer edge of activeness. Early medicinal tang of brett immediately tightens its grip. Flawlessly attenuated. Redefines the term “balance,” as understated doughy malt sweetness gels with brilliantly placed unripe melon acidity. Harsh medicinal-accented stone and wet leather dryness enhance its highly satiating nature and firm up the body’s softness. Slick melon acidity lends more elegance along the way, as a lightly toasty husk base continually highlights the mustiness. Finishes moistly full with a bright dousing of lavender over a well-proportioned integration of floral hops, medicinal brett, and toasted hay. This is right up there with the legends. Not only does the yeast show remarkable composure, but it’s incredibly clean, aromatic, and luxurious all-around. If I died today, I’d die happily.
Heavyweight Golden Idol;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Thanks Steve for the bringing the bottle, ohhh another OTOP beer I have had! Pours a hazy golden hue with a lasting head and very good lace. The aroma has notes of bubblegum, floral and herbal hops, honeydew, anise and corriander, orange zest, sublime brett character, and oh did I say bubblegum? The taste starts with a wonderful apple twang followed closely by bready yeasty character. The finish is quite peppery and even a a touch woody even though I don’t think it is barrel aged. The feel is lively and refreshing, very carbonated. This beer was a bit of a shocker, didn’t think it would be so good. Yummy and would like to try it again. I guess Pailhead would agree...
Heavyweight Golden Idol;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Bottle: Courtesy of wolhfs at Kuhnhenn’s. Huge bubble gum aroma with some fruit. Pours a hazy cloudy dull orange with a white head. Lots of bubble gum up front. Finishes with a decent banana presence and touch of tartness. A light citrus hides in the background along with a light yeastiness. Can’t think of any beer I’ve ever had that had such a strong bubble gum character to it.
Everards Perfick!;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Cask Handpump at the Penny Black, Northwich (JDW) 11/05/2004 Amber golden colour and smooth on the palate. Slightly hoppy with a creamy pleasant malt finish.
Everards Perfick!;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Cask at County Hotel (JDW) Ashford. Chris_o’s assessment is pretty accurate. Brown/orange in colour. Not a lot of nose some goldings citrus. Some body, but you can tell it is dry hopped with its tangy green hops on the end with some lemony flavours. I kind of liked it, but it did not do enough to make it special
Everards Perfick!;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Reporting from London, this is Peter. Refreshing! Just like it says on the tin. Springy and tasty. Lord Moon of the Mall, Whitehall, London.
Everards Perfick!;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Deep amber colour. Slightly hazy. Vaguely lemony aroma but, too be truthful, there’s not a hell of a lot there. Dry taste, with some malt. A bit dusty but somehow citric at the same time. Strong hoppy finish. Leaves a rather earthy, slightly astringent aftertaste. The fact that this uses traditional English hops is very apparent. Its highly hopped but has that typical dusty Goldings character. Very English and very traditional. A good drinking bitter. Cask (handpump), Shakespears Head, Holborn, London.
Everards Perfick!;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;Cask at Leicester Beer Fest 05. Amber with a dirty white white. Aromas are dry and fruity with sulphur and spicy hops - a bit thin, though. Flavours are fruity, even a bit syrupy on the palate. Some hops...I drank it without noticing it. Inoffensive and gluggable.

Everards Perfick!;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Everards;JDW Rochester. Reddish amber best bitter which almost reaches into a premium bitter, but the malt is too mean. Orange marmalade with a healthy bitter finish.

Ommegang Witte Wheat Ale;Cooperstown, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brewery Ommegang (Duvel-Moortgat);I thought I overpaid a little for this single...which I did, but in the end it's good beer. I've paid double this price in this style, for a decent 750ml before, so not that far off. Wanted something new with a summer theme. This fits the category.

Clos des Brumes Cuvée Blé Noir;La Présentation, Quebec, Canada;Mead;Domaine Le Clos des Brumes;"Cet hydromel a 14 ans d’âge. Il est foncé comme du miel d’automne. En le remuant, on se rend compte qu’il est visqueux. Ça sent le ""vin de miel""; sucré par celui-ci, avec une impression de caramel. Des odeurs d’alcool ambré, de bois sec, d’herbes d’automne et de fleurs sauvages. C’est bien dosé côté sucre, c’est légèrement acidulé, fruité; par ce qui ressemble à du raisin vert et même de la pomme. Une finale sur des notes alcoolisées sans extravagances. Un léger accroc indéfinissable. De la cire et de l’alcool pure? Je déchante au court de la dégustation, mais je reste quand même sur une bonne note. (Miellée 2003 Version à 16%) (2311-280817)"
Clos des Brumes Cuvée Blé Noir;La Présentation, Quebec, Canada;Mead;Domaine Le Clos des Brumes;Vintage 2003. Un liquide ambré et ses longue jambes enroulées autour de mes yeux. Ses parfums de miel et de fleurs sont nuancés par des effluves de noisettes. Ses saveurs de miel sont fortifiées et laissent une impression légèrement chocolatée. Son corps est liquoreux. Sa finale se joue sur des notes grillées/rôties étonnantes. Très agréable dégustation.
Clos des Brumes Cuvée Blé Noir;La Présentation, Quebec, Canada;Mead;Domaine Le Clos des Brumes;Sample. [2003] Pours amber/copper with no head. Aroma is of alcohol, flowers, honey. Taste is of alcohol, flowers, honey, oxydation, cardboard. Palate: Full bodied. Soft carbonation. Overall: Not too bad for a mead. Very bold ethanol ( I hope it’s that). Not bad, but somewhat hard to enjoy.
Clos des Brumes Cuvée Blé Noir;La Présentation, Quebec, Canada;Mead;Domaine Le Clos des Brumes;Pours a super clear amber with nice legs. Nose is of oxidized alcohol, light smoke and caramelized honey. Taste is moderately sweet, offers some rough alcohol and honeycomb. Solvent-y but not as much as the Élie-Anne. Hot, fusel-ish alcohol, I can only imagine how headache-inducing this must have been when it came out! Body is medium and mouthfeel sugary and lightly syrupy. Light fruitiness. Not stellar at all but quite a bit more palatable than their 2002 Élie-Anne for sure.

Clos des Brumes Cuvée Blé Noir;La Présentation, Quebec, Canada;Mead;Domaine Le Clos des Brumes;2 oz sample from bottle (500 ml) at home. 2003. Liste as 16.0 % abv. Clear orangey golden leaving some nice legs on the glass. Aroma is of sweet honey, buckwheat, strong floral notes and oxidation (that seems to be on-purpose) presence. Very oaky as well. Sweetness is medium to heavy, but well cut by the oxidation and a mild acidic presence. The buckwheat show up quite a bit. Medium to full body. Oily mouthfeel. Warming finish. Really mellow and smooth while quite complex. A pretty good mead.
Clos des Brumes Cuvée Blé Noir;La Présentation, Quebec, Canada;Mead;Domaine Le Clos des Brumes;Bottle. Not sure this product is the same as some of my friends have rated years ago. This bottle (purchased this month) indicated the honey was from 2003. Pours a still, clear, dark gold pour. Very very woody aroma, calvados notes are rather dominant, I kept thinking ice cider more than mead. The apple brandy character even carries that light sourness/funk of the extra extra old varieties. Needless to add, this beverage is mellow as can be (my bottle was labeled at 16,5%). Finish was still rather sweet, but the palate wasn’t very liquory. Delicious, and a frankly novel experience for me in the domain of mead.
Clos des Brumes Cuvée Blé Noir;La Présentation, Quebec, Canada;Mead;Domaine Le Clos des Brumes;"Bottle (don’t remember the vintage) drunk on 1/27/07 Very bright, brassy gold and hay colored body is glassy-looking, but still transluscent. Fat legs are left on the glass. Thickly sweet, but with a wildflower/perfumey pungency that cuts through the sweetness quite well. Definite medicinal phenolics and light alcohol sharpness appear on the end, but with such low attenuation, all of the pungent, sharp, phenolic and perfumey characteristics are very welcomed as balance. I suppose I smell the ""blé noir"", and it gives off a lightly hay/straw-like scent, but I certainly would never pick it out blindly. Medium strength of aroma. Very sweet up front, just like the aroma, but lavendar notes, wildflowers and light lemon zest-like notes arrive on the finish to help balance. Dry, almost dusty/chewy buckwheat is noticeable, leaving a bit of grassiness or herbal-like flavors behind and helping soke up some of the fat honey sweetness. Alcohol warmth is definitely strong, with some estery/phenolic spiciness on the finish. It’s sweet, for sure, but I like texture of a sweet mead much more than a dry, and this one didnt cloy my palate, rather the perfumey sharpness and alcohol balanced things well enough. Maybe a touch of soapiness, but I think that’s just the buckwheat. Interesting to see the other scores, I’ll have to try it again, though I’m surprised to see everyone call it cloying as I am usually the last person to enjoy something that others feel is too sweet."
Clos des Brumes Cuvée Blé Noir;La Présentation, Quebec, Canada;Mead;Domaine Le Clos des Brumes;Clear rather dark golden hue. Buckwheat brings out some very interesting flavours. I was told the residual sugar content was of 30g/L, but the floury nature of the buckwheat manages to cut through that sweetness a fair bit, which is for the best imo. Rather spicy honeyed flavours with wild flower aromatics siding on. More of an original experience than a pure hedonistic adventure.
Clos des Brumes Cuvée Blé Noir;La Présentation, Quebec, Canada;Mead;Domaine Le Clos des Brumes;Vintage 2000 - Fairly strong alcohol in the floral, woody, honey aroma. Plenty of sweetness apparent. Clear, deep golden coloured body. No real legs on the glass. Sweetness up front is joined by woody honey flavour along with melons and apples. Slight tartness at the end before seetness re-emerges in the aftertaste. Medium body is a bit sticky with strong alcohol warming. Snifter. Cellar temperature. Bottle (Marché des Saveurs, Oct-04).

Nice dark brown color with a great big tan head. Tastes of malty, hops, choclate, and roast. Also a bit nutty and fruity. Palate was good, and there was a slight bitter finish. Overall, an ok Brown Ale, better than most Church brews.
Church Brew Brown Nuevo;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Church Brew Works;"On tap - 4/12/2004. The waiter told me that this was very hoppy - well, ok, compared to they're normal brown ale, sure. Smelled malty sweet and floral hops. Medium deep brown, somewhat clear. Taste was nuts - almonds; sweet bread, mixed with a strong citrus and floral hop presence (I don't know, maybe Amarillo?). Finish was medium bitter. This was great with pizza."

Church Brew Cherry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;Exported rating from 2010. One of the better beers I tried at the brewery following GOSECA. Reddish brown, nice malty backbone. Powerfully sweet at the end.
Church Brew Cherry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;"on tap at the brewpub; amber-red color; a Belgian style beer - fruity and somewhat sour with a bready malt background"
Church Brew Cherry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;750 mL bottle from the brewery. I miss that place. Pours a clear red color with maybe a touch of brown. Medium sized foamy brown head. Decent head retention. Aroma of earth, toffee, yeast, cherry, spice, bready malt. The taste is toffee, bread, tart cherries, dark fruit, anise, spice, yeast, Twizzlers candy, citrus. Medium bodied, low carbonation, moderate booze. Solid.
Church Brew Cherry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;Bottle. Hazy copper with amber tints. Aroma is candy cherries. Taste is cherry cough syrup, Belgian yeast and spices. Heavy mouthfeel and carb. Mostly pleasant but very syrupy and artificial tasting.

Church Brew Cherry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;In short: A boring no-style strong amber ale that doesn’t offer much of anything. How: Bottle 750ml. Not sure about the age, don’t remember when or where I got this. The look: Cloudy dark amber body with lots of small particles topped by a beige ring of foam. In long: Nose is a bit toasted, a sensation of sweet fake-simulated fruit something. Taste is sweet, fruit flavored lollipop, toasted bread crust, fruit seeds, wet paper. Not only did I not find much Abt character here but I didn’t even find much cherry flavor in this cherry Quad. Medium body, medium carbonation. There is no depth to this beer. Nothing good to be found here but the beer is not very tasty at all so at this end it is more an extremely boring beer than a bad beer. Not bad, just very boring, and I prefer to drink a boring beer than to drink a bad beer, my problem is I prefer to drink a bad beer than to drink any other liquid.
Turonis Czech It Out!;Evansville, Indiana, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;Draft: Lightly hazed, faded golden. Diminishing off-white head. Round aroma paired with juicy hops, dough, and lemony herbs. Hints of yeast, pine, melon, mineral, and malt hulls. Soft, extremely round mouthfeel. Fairly fizzy. Starts fruity and slightly acidic. Slightly snappy, grassy hops are underlain with an undefined malt backbone. Mild biscuit sweetness peaks through alongside touches of artificial sweetener and yeast. Bready, strawlike malt finish caresses the apple acidity as the hops depart just as quickly as they come. Needs a firmer dryness to enhance the mild-mannered hop profile. A bit too yeasty aroma, but it's a nice yeast. Adequately flavorsome, albeit restrained, Czech Pils.
Bodicote Golden Balls;Bodicote, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Bodicote;Cask Conditioned at The Plough, Bodicote. Amber to gold beer with short head. Strong peppery hop flavour comes through initially, almost like dry tea with a sweetish base. Dry, fully ferented, a pretty decent attempt.
Bodicote Boilermaker;Bodicote, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bodicote;Cask Conditioned at The Plough, Bodicote. Brown amber beer with thin head. Sweeter than expected with a heavy spicy base. Overlaid hops towards the finish with a tannin twang. A blend I think.

Eastwood & Sanders Anchor Easter Porter;Elland, West Yorkshire, England;Porter;Elland Brewery;Hand pulled at the Anchor, Birmingham. Presumably brewed specially for the pub's Easter festival, this was a Porter slightly weighed down by it's abv. Glossy appearance, with a long lasting creamy head, which left blobs all down my glass. Very rich coffee taste, a heavy mouthfeel, and slightly overbearing, harsh finish.
Addis Ethiopian Lager;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;High Point Brewing Company;A golden-amber colored lager that leaves nice lacing down the entire glass. The aroma and flavor is malty and inviting. A crisp and enjoyable beer that is unfortunately too hard to find.
Addis Ethiopian Lager;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;High Point Brewing Company;Shared the same bottle as goldtwins: Pours a clear copper with well-carbonated fizzy white head. Has a sweet, fresh, grainy malty aroma. Very lively, fizzy mouthfeel has some sweet viscous maltiness underneath. Starts with some mild sweet sugary sorghum and light oxidation. Seems to have aged fairly well.
Addis Ethiopian Lager;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;High Point Brewing Company;I found this at a store that specializes in having beers that are 3-6 years old. Basically they have a bunch of beer that never sold and they won’t throw out or clearence them so they sit. So the raised date on the glass seems to say that it is from 1999. I sort of believe it could be based on the other stuff they have sitting around. It has to be a few years old at least. Poured a clear amber color (the second pour had a good bit of floaters) with a fizzy white head. A ton of fizzy bubbles rose from the bottom. Could this be NJ champagne. Aroma of grainy malt and caramel. The age made it smell like a scotch ale. Flavor of tasted malt and caramel with a semi-dry bitter finish. Fizzy mouth feel. This was tasty. Does it taste like Ethiopian beer? I will probably never know.
Addis Ethiopian Lager;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;High Point Brewing Company;bottle, at Ghenet in NYC. color is murky, mostly golden yellow with some orange tint. head is foamy white. aroma is honeyish, slightly spicy, and floral. flavor is sweet malt and mildly bitter hops. mouthfeel is slick and smooth.
Addis Ethiopian Lager;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;High Point Brewing Company;"Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is clear medium yellow. Aroma is moderately malty (bread, grain), moderately malty (flowers, herbs). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. I had this at Ras Kassa's in Boulder, and frankly was shocked they had a beer that's not available in stores here. I didn't recognize ""HPW Brewing Co., Butler, NJ"" on the label either. So I expected the worst. But what I got was a beer much like Mehana Beer...a solid, nicely malted and hopped Dortmunder. My girlfriend can testify that, as surprised as I was, I gave this a 3.5 before I knew a darn thing about it. And even if it had ended up actually being brewed by Gluek or City or Latrobe, my rating would stand. Thumbs up."

Not much bitterness going on, neither initially nor in the finish. Medium to thin on the palate, soft carbonation. Short and fruity finish. Well, I don’t feel an urge to revisit. 120324

Firehouse Timothys Fear;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);The good looking waitresses kept drinking this beer and said it was one of their best. So i gave it a try and had an odd taste to it. It wasn't overall bad but the only way i would drink another one is if one of the ladies show me their tits.
Firehouse Timothys Fear;Rapid City, South Dakota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Firehouse Brewing Company (SD);Very dark beer with no head. The bartender said this was his favorite and it appeared as if the waitresses liked it too as they kept pouring small glasses of it out of the tap and drinking it themselves. I believe it is one of their brewmasters specialties and will rarely be available. The bartender also said it was pretty strong in alcohol content as well. My roommate and I tried all six beers they had on tap and I woke up the next morning puking sick with hives, so maybe I am allergic to some of the hops or barley in one of their beers. But in their defense the beers were mighty tasty especially the Brown Cow Ale.

Forst Birra di Pasqua (Osterbier);Algund/Lagundo (BZ), Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Forst;Pale golden colour, large white head, slowly to disappears. Fine hoppy aroma (hops flower, hay) on a clean malt base. The Forst honey-sweetness lacks in flavor, that is more herbal, finish with a round bitter taste and turns in a soft bitterish aftertaste. Medium to light body, pleasant and easy to drink. Filtered but unpasteurized, it is a nice fresh pils, probably an all-malt beer, surely the best pale beer from Forst.

Five Beer;Lemesos, Cyprus;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;KEO;A rather average lager, soft malty flavour, not much in the way of hops. I found this in a taverna in Larnaca, but I did not see it in any shops, so it may be discontinued.

Tentaka Kokoro Junmai Ginjo Sake;Yuzukami-mura, Otawara, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Tentaka Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Buttery mouthfeel with a pleasant aroma that’s floral/candyish. So it was off to a good start. But then the alcohol showed through and I had some misgivings. It wasn’t bad alcohol flavor, though. It’s no jet fuel sake. But the alcohol was definitely there in a slightly harsh way. So IMHO this isn’t a ’true’ ginjo b/c it didn’t taste like one. I believe this is about $7/bottle in Manhattan.

Kuhnhenn Grand Cru;Warren, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;I’m always hesitant to venture into a brewery’s grand cru offering since it often ends up a syrupy alcoholic mess. This one however is much more subtle and pleasant and breaks that mold. A spicy, golden belgian style of beer with a cloudy dark yellow look and a frothy white head. Spicy aroma and a smooth thick dark grain aroma coming up as well. Full bodied, banana and deep wheat sort of flavor. Finish is peppery and a hint of lemon. A nice belgian strong ale that is a pleasant grand cru.

Kuhnhenn Hefeweizen;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"Tap @ Kuhnhenn: Have had this at many places, sometimes labeled ""Kuhnhenn Hefeweizen"", other times as ""Kuhnieweizen"", & even a few times as ""Kuhnhenn Hefe"" & I’m just assuming it’s the same beer. Review based on first sample ever at the brewery. Super hazy straw-yellow body; crazy unfiltered with a huge, chunky, puffy white head that lasts for days leaving nice lacing behind. Nice. Aromas of clove, fruity esters, faint spice, old banana, & a heavy dose of pink, sugary bubblegum. Taste reminds me of banana flavored salt-water taffy, laced with shavings of mint leaves & ground cloves. Tons of yeasty flavor with a huge Bazooka Joe bubblegum finish. Blanket of soft wheat & semi-spicy Belgian yeast coats the palate in the aftertaste. Would prefer a slightly heftier & chewier body, but it’s still not bad. Overall, pretty enjoyable American made hefeweizen."

Black Forest Rauch Bier;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Black Forest Brew Haus;One of my favorite styles and one that I'm easily impressed with. However, this brewery cannot seem to get out of it's own way. Why is it so light? Has a light amber color with a lasting head but that's just about the only good thing I can really say. With the new brewer, I really hope they can get it together.
Rogue Chipotle Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Rogue Ales;I'm still on the fence with this one. Although the beer was smooth like most Rogues, crisp, etc....the Chipotle took a bit getting used to. It definitely had some spice/heat to it, but nothing overwhelming like I was afraid of. Reminded me of a ginger beer. The base seemed like a milder Red Ale, the appearance medium brown with slight red/amber tint. Other tastes of honey and caramel, a little bit of hops. Overpriced IMO, but hey...it's Rogue! With so many others out there I'll probably pass on this again, but was nice to try.
Rogue Chipotle Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Rogue Ales;Bomber (40 IBUs and 5.4% ABV) - nose is rye IPA with spicy peppers. Sip adds mellow heat at least for the first couple. Not getting much of the smoked qualities. Light burn in the back of the throat as it goes down. A little sweet. I like the heat, but I'd expect more based on the size of the red pepper on the label.
Rogue Chipotle Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Rogue Ales;22oz bottle. Wow. Really cool beer. Rogue gets no fanfare, but still make some excellent stuff...this being a prime example. Smoky enough to be a Rauchbier for sure. Super clean body. Great smoked tones, deep vegetal peppery tones, hints and nuances of heat, but never overboard. Shows some serious finesse, body is clean and drinkable. Beyond cool that they make all the ingredients themselves. Really well done smoked pepper beer.
Rogue Chipotle Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Rogue Ales;Light amber pour. Bit of a caramel aroma. Malty taste, nice bit of heat towards the end.
Rogue Chipotle Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Rogue Ales;Pours a slightly hazy, deep mahogany coloration with an amber hue and a medium, foamy head. Smells of bready malt and smoke, with just a hint of the chipotle peppers as well. Taste is foremost quite smokey, almost making this seem like a Rauchbier. It also has the typical malt profile of a Rauchbier, with dark, bready, but also slightly sweet caramel malts at the forefront. Not a lot of hop presence, but some light earthy/grassy notes are there as well. The chili note is quite well-balanced, with a good spiciness that isn't burning your tongue off. Finishes bittersweet, with a pleasant chili note lingering on the tongue for quite a while. This is a really nice Rauch/chile style hybrid with a good balance of flavours. Actually tastes a bit like a Schlenkerla with added chipotle. *Reviewed from memory
Rogue Chipotle Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Rogue Ales;"From Dec 2005 Poured from bottle(room temp) a nice amber with a huge head that settled down after a while but remained throughout. The smell was malty..can't say any of the peppers made it to my nose. The taste was very malty and then notes of ""heat"" made their presence and lingered right through the aftertaste. This is a very different kind of beer for me and though I ""feel"" that this must be one of the better examples of the style, I have to think the style is not for me. Try it and find out for yourself. ;^)"

They offered some restrained notes of flowers, plants and citrus, with a somewhat harsh, bitter-grass quality in the aftertaste. Carbonation seemed a bit too much. Relatively drinkable, overall, but not my kind of IPA -- American style or English style."
Granville Island Whitecaps IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Ratings from notes taken September 09. Light yellow pour, hoppy aroma. Flavor was also lightly hoppy with some sweet citrus on the finish. Not bad, but average.
Granville Island Whitecaps IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Another of GI’s limited releases, for Spring. Quite a nice IPA, with a good, foamy head and a light amber colour. Not a lot of aroma to this one, but I did enjoy the somewhat hoppy taste. I’ll be getting a few more of these to put away for later. Too bad GI doesn’t brew this all year, as it ’tis MUCH better than their everyday stuff.

Pleasant aroma of soft, sweet malt and pine & citrus hops. Medium bodied. Flavour follows the aroma - fairly simple, but a good flavour balance of sweet malt and citric hops, with a moderately long finish. Not earth-shattering, but quite enjoyable.
Augusta Scotch Ale;Washington, Missouri, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Augusta Brewing Company;Tasted at the 1st Annual Urban Chestnut - Wolpertinger festival in St. Louis, MO, USA from tap into sampler beer boot. Poured a clear brown color with moderate white head. Mild earthy, bready aroma, with a funky fermentation smell. Flavor was even more tainted, drinkable but something weird and bacterial going on. Too bad, I usually like Augusta brews and Scotch ales in general.
Augusta Scotch Ale;Washington, Missouri, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Augusta Brewing Company;Cask Stillage from the Jug at the GABF, Colorado Convention Center 24/09/2009 Big malt aroma.

Vapeur en Folie Mars (La Bière et La Bête);Leuze-Pipaix, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie à Vapeur;Typical and interesting representative of a style that can be called ’strong saison’. Crackling, sticky, irregular, dense and stable, off-white head and deep orangey peach blonde colour, cloudy. Earthy, yeasty and fruity barnyard saison aroma, pear, peach, orange, liquorice, hay, spicy hops, honey, ginger, calvados, cognac. Fresh fruity taste with restrained sweetness, soft maltiness, medium carbo, ’juicy’ middle phase with dry spicy accents, mild hop bitter finish with some warm alcohol. Very enjoyable beer but I do not understand the difference with Vapeur en Folie - if there is one, at all.
Vapeur en Folie Mars (La Bière et La Bête);Leuze-Pipaix, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie à Vapeur;Bottle, 75 cl. Taste last saturday with William, Leen, and Paul. Great beer ! Hazy golden color, with thin head. Aroma spice, wood sour. Medium body. Taste dry, spices, sourness (like gueuze), wild yeast. A complex beer.
Vapeur en Folie Mars (La Bière et La Bête);Leuze-Pipaix, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie à Vapeur;Head is initially large, frothy, white, fully lasting. Body is hazy dark yellow, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (cereal, toasted grain), lightly hoppy (flowers), with a note of apple. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Another corny-smelling beer from Vapeur. Very similar to the regular en Folie.
Vapeur en Folie Mars (La Bière et La Bête);Leuze-Pipaix, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie à Vapeur;"Dry and rustic aroma, perfume hints, bursting with sticky fruits; apples and lemon, with hints of gummy bears. Dirty orange color. Really sweet, somewhat grainy flavor with an unpleasant slickness to the palate, sweet fruit, hops and yeast. I enjoyed the overall character. Thanks Ernest."
Vapeur en Folie Mars (La Bière et La Bête);Leuze-Pipaix, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie à Vapeur;"(Is this beer different from the regular en Folie? My notes tend to a certain difference. I tried to phone the brewery, but no response, yet - in the mean time...) Quite pale yellow; good fluffy head, lively carbonation. Dry aromatic spices on a background of earthy smells. Slightly soapy and obvious alcohol. Liquorice - in a terrible way. Loads of it, suspended in an alcohol tincture. very dry again, some other spices. Scorched sugar, still a lot of sweetness, and, in the aftertaste, a little sourness and prickly feeling - no doubt partly the high carbonation. In the aftertaste, and after a glass or so, the liquorice has subsided."
Lion d'Or Ambrée d'Amour;Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lion d'Or / Golden Lion Pub & Brewery;"Orangée, presque rouge ; nez en fruits rouges, en baies et en sucres. Acidulée en bouche, fort goût de fruits (framboises, canneberges), mince et aqueuse. Évidemment, cette bière n’a aucune personnalité, ne représente aucun style, donc le brasseur n’a pas trouvé mieux que de trouver une gamique (les aphrodisiaques) pour vider les tablettes. J’ai des nouvelles pour lui, à l’endroit où je travaille elle est ""la bière dont tout le monde oublie qu’elle existe"". Tout en étant en quelque sorte la risée de ceux qui se rappelent d’elle."

La Barberie Pale Ale Anglaise;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Draught at Le Saint Bock. Pours a clear orange-copper with an average size lasting frothy off-white head. Aroma: Oh, that’s unfortunate, it doesn’t smell very good, sweet and grainy -- it smells more like an average-at-best Pilsener. Flavour’s disappointing as well, it’s watery and overly light with a very light bitter finish. Light to medium bodied. A total failure of a Pale Ale.
La Barberie Pale Ale Anglaise;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Microbrasserie La Barberie;On tap at Le Saint Bock. Slight English hops in the aroma, with a little biscuity malt. Flavor was quite bitter, a little too much acutally. Meh. I’m not a big fan of this brewery

La Barberie Pale Ale Anglaise;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Auburn hue, veiled and topped by a solid white foam that slowly diminishes. Spicy flowers come out mild in the otherwise rather simplistic malt nose that hints at sand or dry earth as well as apples, peaches and soft juicy fruitiness. In mouth, it keeps in the same vein, being muddled, yet not bland. Thin bodied, strongly carbonated for an english style ale, but it doesn’t agress the tongue. Well, I can’t say I enjoy that yeastiness much, it does hold a concrete/tart/apple character I don’t dig, but this is otherwise a solid effort.

La Barberie Cuivrée au Coing;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Thanks for the translation Martin. This beer was interesting if only for the experience of the Francophone server trying to explain to me WTF a Coing was. After a very detailed description I knew this much - it was a fruit! Hazy golden yellow with a whitish head. Aroma is somewhat muted but contains some interesting fruit notes. Some hoppy bitterness and an interesting bitter not quite astringency that brings to mind plants or grape stems. Very different beer, worth trying. Mondial 2T (Me).

Putney Mountain Heirloom Cuvee;Putney, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Putney Mountain Winery;Bottle thanks to Cletus (who also sent me their Mountain Mac, which I quite enjoyed). Pours with no head over a clear, burnt golden body. Light alcohol legs. Aroma of apple sauce, light wine notes, tartness, smoked apple wood and lightly metallic. Taste is sweet up front with apple sauce and light astringent spice, followed by a slight tart citrus note finishing with lemon meringue. Tingly carbonation, sort of like some frowned upon Lost Abbey beers (i.e. perfectly acceptable carbonation for the style). I actually enjoyed the complexity of the Mountain Mac a touch more.
Putney Mountain Heirloom Cuvee;Putney, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Putney Mountain Winery;Pours a clear gold and has such a lively carbonation that it actually maintains a pretty big head for a few second. Of course, lacking the proteins of beer, that head quickly wisps away, bu tthe carbonation continues to stream heavily up the column of liquid. There’s a slight musty/earthy aroma a bit like oats in the aroma, but that’s under a very strong aroma of an apple that’s gone just past prime crunchy eating stage and has headed a little into the grainy/mushy stage, but hasn’t started to rot yet. The yeasty or whatever smell is a lot like that in champagne. Rolls and a bit of vanilla. Starts out as a bit of a shock compared to what I’m used to in ciders, but it really grows on you.
Putney Mountain Heirloom Cuvee;Putney, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Putney Mountain Winery;Pours like sparkling wine, pale yellow, with a lot of carbonation.

Putney Mountain Heirloom Cuvee;Putney, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Putney Mountain Winery;Pours clear with nice carbonation. Taste is of sugar cane, honey and apples. A cider that tends to be more on the sweet side than their other ciders.
Putney Mountain Heirloom Cuvee;Putney, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Putney Mountain Winery;750 ml cobalt bottle (points for the gorgeous container). Slightly foggy burnished brass, little fizziness. Welcoming nose of fresh apples, vanilla, sherry, oak. Alcohol quite present in very sweet initial flavor, but this is not a bad thing: complex notes of calvados, cognac, amaretto ... very liqueur-like and strong and warming. Somewhat flowery in the middle, rather full-bodied for a cider, fairly strong alcohol burn all the way through, rather dry finish, light carbonation. Very interesting, perhaps intimidating and too alcoholic for some, but I like it quite a bit...far and away the best of the three Putneys I’ve had, and now I can’t wait for the last two!

Dusty, faded straw body. Wheaty, yeasty, tart, cardboard scent. Taste is saline, hay, core, mineral water. Yeasty & a touch medicinal. A hard sparkle. None of these are very good.
Bellwether Lord Scudamore Dry Sparkling Hard Cider;Trumansburg, New York, United States;Apple Cider;Bellwether Hard Cider;750mL Bottle, poured at CiderDays 2011. Astringent wax arom and flavor that are unpleasant. Almost heads into band-aids or medicine territory, which is kind of bizarre and off. Carbonation levels are really enjoyable, but there’s a rough, chemmy, bitterness throughout.

Bellwether Lord Scudamore Dry Sparkling Hard Cider;Trumansburg, New York, United States;Apple Cider;Bellwether Hard Cider;Effervesance greets you at the pour. The first taste can offset you a little, lot of metabisulfite. After that it goes real nice with the flavor changing from dry and yeasty to aromatic and acidic as the bottle warms. Flavor and quality equal to that of the English producers I have sampled, dry and not at all sweet. Great to be drinking a product from a local producer.

Butcombe Blond (Bottle/Keg);Wrington, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Butcombe Brewery (Liberation Group);Bottle at home. Pours very pale yellow-straw with some creamy head. Aroma wheaty and citrus. Overall quite watery, but refreshing.
Butcombe Blond (Bottle/Keg);Wrington, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Butcombe Brewery (Liberation Group);Keg pour. Bright gold with strong white head. Massive citrus aroma. Not like grapefruit and lime though, more like a herbal lemongrassy note which is very strong yet very rounded. Sets the beer off beautifully with a strong earthy citrus aroma. Taste is biscuity malt, balanced between dry and sweet with an earthy green citrus lash of bitterness which just about persists but doesn’t assault the palate. Overall very very good. Much better than I expected. Beautiful interplay of the aromas and flavours of both hops and malt. Perhaps just a touch too sweet if anything
Butcombe Blond (Bottle/Keg);Wrington, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Butcombe Brewery (Liberation Group);From a 500ml bottle.

Dark Star Oatmeal Stout;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Stout;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Had in a large format bottle in British Columbia. Pours a dark medium black with a very thin viscosity. Slight bitterness on the finish, not very dry. Tasty and balanced but certainly not a memorable brew.

Dark Star Oatmeal Stout;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Stout;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);A Mes rate: Keg at The Evening Star. Dark mahogany with a slight tan head.

Dark Star Oatmeal Stout;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Stout;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask (gravity) London Drinker festival 2006. A reasonable stout, but perversly chewy and washy at the same time. Good roast and choc flavours but (almost literally) pales by comparison to other Dark Star stouts we tried that day.
Dark Star Oatmeal Stout;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Stout;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Pint poured at The Evening Star in Brighton, very dark with a creamy tan head. Aroma is of roasted coffee. Tastes stronger than its 4.2%, flavours of cherries and molasses, a bit tart.
Dark Star Oatmeal Stout;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Stout;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask (gravity dispense), London Drinker Beer Festival, March 2006. Very roasty, with plenty of coffee in the aroma. More deep malt o=in the flavour, with chocolate backup. Oatmeal stouts often have some residual sweetness, but not this one. Resoundingly dry, with a lasting, distinctly bitter finish. Light, but smooth, mouthfeel. I like it!

Oirase Dark Lager;Towadako Machi, Aomori-Ken, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Oirase Brewing Company;---------new rating 2016----------- Got a bottle of this (proper glass not the aluminium stubby) and shared it with a few guys. It was a properly done dark lager with no off flavors and I found it satisfying. And I do feel that the dark character was more prominent this time around so I’m bumping the rating up to 3.5 ---------original rating June 2014------------- Bottle from the Akihabara Station Nomono, 5% a very dark brown that is black in the glass with ruby highlights & a thick beige head that dissipates quickly. Served in a pilsner glass. The aroma is rich dark malts with caramel, breadiness & light chocolate. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin & watery at first but then becomes more satisfying. The taste is a sweet graininess which gives it some breadiness, light chocolate, a bit of roast and a touch of caramel but this is quite malty in the sense it smells & tastes mostly like grains. It’s OK but I’d like the dark malt character to shine through more. 3.2
Oirase Dark Lager;Towadako Machi, Aomori-Ken, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Oirase Brewing Company;Drought at Bay Brewing Yokohama. Black with a large head. Creamy nose with roasted malt. Flavor of rich malt, chocolate, and cream, vanilla. Well balanced but somewhat non-descript. A tasty enough dunkel.
Oirase Dark Lager;Towadako Machi, Aomori-Ken, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Oirase Brewing Company;After nearly resigning myself to the fact that I’d be drinking mostly watery Pale Lagers while in Japan, I came across these gems...This one poured a nice dark coffee-colored brown with a coarse, foamy, but modest tan head that faded fairly quickly. The aromas were sweet and malty, with hints of coffee, cocoa, and a slight nuttiness. Flavors were malty and sweet, with some slight acidity, a bready yeastiness, a fairly strong suggestion of chocolate, and hints of coffee and roasted nuts. I enjoyed the ample carbonation, but found the body to be almost a bit watery--it seemed to be lacking a certain amount of heaviness or intensity for the style. Regardless, I’ll be drinking these regularly, as I live in Aomori Prefecture, where they are brewed!
Oirase Dark Lager;Towadako Machi, Aomori-Ken, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Oirase Brewing Company;"350 mL Plastic Bottle: Dark brown, nearly black color that turns a beautiful ruby color when held up to the light. A light but fizzy head with a stout ring of lacing around the edge. The nose is very strong with sweet roasted chocolate, mocha, hazelnut, burnt toast, licorice and lactose. Cocoa, carob and other various chocolatey notes are here en force. A bit of tartness like a partial sour mash or yogurt bacteria. The flavor is incrimentally sour than the nose but it’s pleasant, not repulsive; something to add to the complexity. It all melts away after several drinks though. The finish is light and watery with some bitter cocoa. Thanks to IslandHaole for this interesting dunkel!"
Oirase Dark Lager;Towadako Machi, Aomori-Ken, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Oirase Brewing Company;Quick dissipating white head. A light brown body. Solid chocolately nose with slight sour overtones and faint hints of chocolate and nuts. Light bodied, mildly sour, chocolate coffee mouth and slightly sour malty chocolately finish. Re-rating almost six years later from a 2.7 to 3.6. Dramatically improved over this time period. lots of roasted malt nose. Mouth is malty, lots Of chocolate malt and roasty character with a touch of astringency. Very nice with good depth
Oirase Dark Lager;Towadako Machi, Aomori-Ken, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Oirase Brewing Company;After a year and a half of drinking this beer, it’s about time I got around to rating it! A clear dark brown with a small tan head. Mild roasty malts, coffee, nuts, wood, cocoa. Mild roasted malts up front, sweeter in the middle with a bitter dark chocolate follow. This is my beer of choice (except when the Porter or Amber Ale are in season) on the 2 hr all you can drink for 2000 yen ($20) nights at the brewery (45 mins from my house)
General Lafayette Double Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;Thanks to axilla for sharing. I had no idea this beer existed. Extremely dark black body with a medium dark brown head but I was drinking this in the twilight so of course it looked black as death. Moderately boozy rich dark chocolate, chocolate syrup and moderately strong roast, the mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, but in a really nice smooth way, while the alcohol (tasted like bourbon!) was a little high or too apparent but didn’t take anything away. In fact it hit the spot. Complex, rich chocolate and charred fruit flavors, even some dark roast coffee in there as well. An awesome Baltic Porter, and one I was happy I got a chance to try.
General Lafayette Double Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;Vintage 2003, sampled July 2006. A pitch black beer with a lazing brown head. The aroma contains lots of chocolate, madeira, and over ripe fruits, as well as light notes of oxidation and licorice. The flavor is sweet with a strong malt presence and notes of over ripe fruits alcohol, madeira, raisins, and chocolate as well as a light oxidation.
General Lafayette Double Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;25oz bottle from basement at brew pub.2005 version. Pures very dark brown with no head or carbonation. Smell of coffee, brown sugar, and roasted malts. Taste mildy sweet with coffee, roasted malty flavors throughout.The body was kind of thin but o.k. The flavors dissapers fast and leaves and dry hoppy aftertaste.
General Lafayette Double Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;@ brewpub. Poured a dark mahogany/black body with a foamy tan head. The aroma was sweet milk chocolate, cherries, and light coffee and cream. Flavors were hershey bars with coffee and cream. Some berries and sweet smoke in the finish. Very thick and oily mouthfeel. I Love This Beer!
General Lafayette Double Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;Soy, sugar and liquorice notes to the roasted malt aroma with some light fruitiness. Opaque dark brown body with a low tan head that recedes slowly but completely. Chocolate flavour has some nice fruitiness and a pleasantly roasty finish. Medium body with low carbonation and some alcohol warming. Sampled on tap at the brewpub with beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, Rastacouere and Yowie.
General Lafayette Double Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;Pours a black color with a tiny ring of light brown lace. Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate and subtle fruits. Good flavor of roasted malt, chocolate and underlying fruits with a bitter finish. The body is light with a dry texture and low carbonation. This is good, maybe not as I thought it would be but still a very pleasant experience.
General Lafayette Double Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;The Lure: Subtle grapiness escapes the chocolatey sweet malt pond. A straightforward dessert must ensue. The cask version has much more vanilla, and is sweeter and bolder. The Festivities: Roasted malt flavor and bitterness lathers the cocoa powder and smooth vinosity. Hot alcohol laces on the dark chocolate bar and warns of its warming effect. The cask version showcases more alcohol, a flatter feel, and a disparate amalgamation of flavors. The regular tap serves it much better, no doubt. Transcendence: Those ice cream bars do their job very well.
General Lafayette Double Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;Dark brown pour, light brown ring. I tried both the cask and draft version and they were quite different. The cask felt a bit dull, soy saucy and kind of like a dark malts soup. On the other hand, the keg offered a more interesting cakey sweetness with certainly a beany aspect, but it was more vanilla-ish than vegetal this time. The mouthfeel was quite oily with that low carbonation, full and fatiguing. Rather complex flavours with good supporting hops and roastiness hinting at cocoa and herbs. Still, more integration and roundness would have been welcome and the usual fruitiness forgot the meeting.
General Lafayette Double Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;On tap at the GLI. Poured a dark black with an averaged sized brownish head. Aromas and tastes of chocolates, roasted malts, and some dark fruits lurking in the back ground. Starts of lightly sweet and ends in a nice coffee bitter finish. I didn’t get any alcohol in the aromas and tastes - I wouldn’t have guessed it was 9.4%. Lacing left on the glass.
General Lafayette Double Thunder;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;Had this at the Manayunk fest and it got lost in my notes. Poured deep black/mahogany with a big tan head. Nice coffee/chocolate aroma, with a roasty malt flavor followed up by coffee, more chocolate, and a slightly dry, creamy, smooth finish. Very good.
Beowulf Horseman;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beowulf Brewing;Cask at the Waggon and Horses, Halesowen. Pours gold with a small head. Aroma is straw and biscuit malt. Taste has straw malt and some cooked veg. Easy drinking but probably should’ve stayed retired.
Beowulf Horseman;Brownhills, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beowulf Brewing;Hand pulled at The Anchor, Birmingham. Red/golden colouring - no head and a sunflower aroma. Apple and pineapple taste. Sugar lumps and some mixed up malt in here too, plus and unspecified vegetable presence. Slippery, slightly bitter, hoppy aftertaste.

Brootcoorens Angélus Brune;Erquelinnes, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Brasserie Brootcoorens Erquelinnes;"Brune belge de 7 % abv, présentée comme "" naturelle pur malt "". Mon exemplaire était à 26 mois avant sa date. Couleur brun caramel sombre, à la clarté nette. Bulles en fontaine centrale, vives. Mousse beige, soyeuse, stable à 3 mm. Arômes de peau de prune, baies noires, pêche de vigne. 1ère bouche souple, sur des fanes de pomme de terre. Arrière-bouche assez évasive, sans vraie personnalité. 2ème qui reste sur un produit assez vague, plus français que belge (mais on est ici à deux doigts de la frontière …). Arrière-bouche assez primitive, un peu comme une infusion de plantes. La longueur ne trouve aucune personnalité, juste un peu plus liée. Jambes à gros flocons, assez courtes. Levure basique. Alcool assez indifférent à ce qui se passe dans votre verre, il est là comme une potiche .. Finale tout aussi vague.

Great Waters Piper Down Scotch Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Scottish Ale;Great Waters Brewing;"Cask sample. Dark, dark whiskeyish look. Looked-for peaty, earthy, meaty nose was there; earthy caramel-port-whiskey flavors quite intriguing; chewy texture balanced by a velvety quality that is almost, but not quite TOO smooth.

Great Waters Piper Down Scotch Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Scottish Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Cask. Dark brown but almost ruby color. Nice, large, foamy head. A little chocolate and wood in the nose. Flavor is very good: chocolate, malt, slightly sweet. I swore I could taste a berry (raspberry?), but my drinking colleague could not place it either. Very smooth and flavorful.
Great Waters Piper Down Scotch Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Scottish Ale;Great Waters Brewing;On cask: Dark brown color with a substantially large head produced from that wondeful cask pull that sticks around the entire glass, lacing in super sticking webby sheets. Aroma is soft of chocolate roast and a bit of melon-like sweetness. Taste has a nice calming melon sweet front dusted with chocolate, midway turns to more of a slightly roastier tone within the chocolate, great subtle turns within the chocolate throughout. Soft, supple, yet giving malt base. Stable finish thats quickly resolved and eagers you to take more in as the flavors continue to intrigue sip after sip. Solid feel, on cask this comes across much cleaner with a nicer creamyness then most of the casks I've had at GW over the years. Very smooth, clean, and quaffable!

Big River Grille California Common;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);A one day old growler. The whole growler. Pours dark copper with a frothy, though quickly disappearing white head. The aroma is fairly hoppy, but only in the way of Euro hops. Wood, hay, and an interesting fruity character are noted. The mouthfeel is medium. This is pretty crisp, but not overly vegetal or doughy like a lager may be. The fruit notes are more like berries and less like apples. Hops are approachable but assertive, given the style. This is a basic beer that reminds me of the cheap crap in cans at the grocery store, but without any of the flaws. This is smooth, clean, and very drinkable without any surprises or super deep complexity.
Big River Grille California Common;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Draught in Chattanooga.

Big River Grille California Common;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Dark orange appearance with a moderate head. The aroma was faint malt and candy. Flavor was malty and a little on the light side. This favored a lager more than an ale. The aftertaste was slightly bitter. Although I have to admit I had a hard time concentrating on the flavor with all the people looking down at me from the elevated walkway directly above my head. Overall a refreshing beer for the summer months but nothing outstanding. Perhaps we will see this one at the upcoming Georgia Beer Festival??

Pumphouse Passion Fruit Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub, 4/13/06: Same color as their basic wheat. Same slick felling but with a fruity juiciness. Good breakfast beer.
Pumphouse Passion Fruit Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draught. Body is hazy medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly hoppy (grapefruit), with a light note of lemon peel. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Pretty ordinary wheat if you ask me...I didn’t find any passionfruit resemblance, and it’s on the bland side even given the style.
Pumphouse Passion Fruit Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Notes from a long ago trip to Longmont... Has the cloudy wheat look, slightly fruity nose, but really lacks any wheat crispness.
Pumphouse Passion Fruit Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Hazy and yellow-gold, similar to the Wildfire Wheat in appearance. Actually, texture and flavor was very similar as well ... except for the addition of the passion fruit flavors/aromas, which were very mild overall. Noticed mostly in the finish: a little sugary and fruity in the flavor dept., with a mild passion-fruit aroma. Not bad, but rather light-tasting. RERATE 2005: Crisp / lively carbonation. Seemed fruitier than the last sample I had. Mild sweetness. Notes of mango and starfruit in the aroma. Overall, kind of thin and uneventful. Aromas were nice, but the passed quickly.
Ottos Arthurs Rye Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Transfer from BA review on 3-12-13- Served on hand pump in a pint glass Appearance – Served a hazy orange color with a one half finger just off white head. The head fades very rapidly leaving a decent level of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell- The aroma is mainly of a rye and bready nature mixed with grapefruit hop. Lingering with these aromas is a very light tangerine and a small amount of floral hop and almost spicy aroma. Taste – The flavor begins mainly of a bready and moderate rye flavor. These more malty flavors create a base for the brew and remain relatively constant throughout the taste. Upfront the taste is rather dry with a moderate grapefruit hop taste at the start. As the flavor advances the grapefruit hop grows stronger in nature and is joined by a lighter tangerine flavor that brings a light sweetness to the beer. The grapefruit hop maximizes more toward the middle of the taste and remains strong till the end. The tangerine fades a bit however and is replaced by a caramel sweetness more toward the end. Along with the transitions of the lighter sweet flavors, a pine hop and lightly spiced flavor comes to the tongue at the end of the taste, with the combination of flavors leaving a bready and rather bitter grapefruit hop flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thicker and chewier side with a carbonation level (as would be expected for a hand pump brew) that is a bit on the lower side. The thicker body and lower carbonation suit the hoppier flavor as well as rye quite nicely really giving those flavors a chance to be appropriately sensed by the tongue. Overall – A pretty nice Rye PA. A little dry and quite grapefruit hop heavy (possibly a bit more pine or earth would helped level it a bit more) but rather flavorful and quite nicely drinkable. Not bad and one to try if you have the chance.
Ottos Arthurs Rye Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On cask at Otto's Pub and Brewery. Cloudy dark copper pour. A fair amount of lacing after a fast fading tan head. Fresh grassy hop aroma with some rye spice. Flavor is slightly citrusy, grassy hops. Spicy rye accented malt backbone. Soft mouthfeel. Very nice on cask. The hop character is fresh--dry hopped?--and the ale is well balanced. Very flavorful, with a fair amount of carbonation for a cask ale. ---Rated via Beer Buddy from my iPad.
Ottos Arthurs Rye Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Light hop aroma, with some malts - a bit sweet. Caramel-dark brown clear with small off-white head (lacing not apparent in sampler glass). Smooth palate, easy carbonation (hand pump) in nice medium body. Starts rather acidic with good bit of malt. Finish is dry, lightly acidic, and a touch of sweetness, though also has a pronounced sourness. Still, nicely balanced.
Ottos Arthurs Rye Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Pours orangish amber with a good head. Aroma of malt, rye, and some hops. Slightly bitter, rye finish.
Ottos Arthurs Rye Ale;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Otto's Pub and Brewery;First rye ale I have had. Very subtle grainy aroma, mixed with hay and spicy hops. Firm body with hints of oak and maybe rice?? Finishes kinda flat. Interesting. Definitely worth a try.
Ottos HellKat;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Hazy peach body with a lacy, buff-colored head. Aroma of banana and prominent clove-like phenols with an unexpected nutty cocoa note plus some light caramelization and apparent candi sugar. Flavor is medium sweet with full banana esters, cocoa, and a moderately phenolic and subtle bitter finish that has a wood stem character. Somewhat syrupy, medium-full texture. Another good one.
Ottos HellKat;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Otto's Pub and Brewery;2006 Batch. First impression: looks perfect, nice head that thins out but stays. Mild aroma. Big flavor that sticks. Can Not taste the 9.2%, thats what makes an strong ale count. Very drinkable. Good belgian. Cheers!
Ottos HellKat;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Nice sweet aroma, like a barley wine. Candi sugar, oak, vanilla, Twizzlers. Malty and no hops. Brilliant orange-amber clear with little off-white head. Heavy watery body, very smooth and chewy. Starts a little acidic but predominantly very sweet - sugary. Malts, vanilla, oak, and really strong presence of the alcohol. Finish is vapory, with alcohol notes, oak - sweet. Hangs on the tongue, but not cloying like thicker beers. Nice balancing dryness - a bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Nice. Nutty, just a bit sour throughout.
Ottos HellKat;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Reddish amber color with a non-existant off white head. Sweet malt, light fruits, strong alcohol aroma. Very sweet, candy sugar, light fruits, mild yeast, and and an alcohol finish. Just OK, but not one of the best I had tonight. This was a real ass kicker.
Ottos HellKat;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Pours brownish amber with medium head. Aroma of malt, fruit, cognac, toffee. Finishes with a nice malty sweetness, with some cognac and candi sugars. Nice complexity.
Ottos HellKat;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Strong fusel aroma...fermented too warm, perhaps? Funky phenols mix with the expected raisins and dough and figs and mild hops and caramel. Firm body and looks just right. Finishes with too much alcohol. Flawed but if they could fix the wierd fusel alcohol problem this would score much higher.

Aroma is slightly grainy with some malt coming through. Flavor is like most other blond ales I've tried...very mild but nothing offensive. Body is good for the style.
Beaver Street Lager del Sol;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Beaver Street Brewery;Pale yellow, almost doesn’t even look like beer. Nose is somewhat sweet, but doesn’t look or smell like much. Flavor was light malts, with no hop presence. Somewhat sweet, and not at all bad. A bit bland, but considering the competition in this style, it’s great.
Beaver Street Lager del Sol;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Beaver Street Brewery;A very nice upscale version of Corona. This one poured a pale yellow color with little aroma. The flavor was rather sweet, very malty, and lacking hop balance. Not sessionable, as it was too thick of a mouthfeel and too sweet of a flavor. No head or lacing.
Beaver Street Lager del Sol;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Beaver Street Brewery;Server said this is suppose to be like corona. Well clear gold body and not much for a head sereved with a lime. Aroma was of lime. Had a lemon and lime flavor to it. Slight bitterness also. Better than Corona I would say.
Beaver Street Lager del Sol;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Beaver Street Brewery;Virtually clear, barely any color, but surprisingly full malt aroma and flavor on a light-bodied brew. They stuffed a lime on it to make it look like Corona I guess, but this is way better.
Beaver Street Lager del Sol;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Beaver Street Brewery;Pours a very yellow gold color with a small fizzy head. Aroma is somewhat grainy but actually better notes than others of this style. Some malt and caramel were present through the grain notes. Flavor was as the aromas predicted...grainy but if you diug deeper you could detect some better things going on in the beer. Body is medium and better than most in this style. I say thumbs up.

Rio Salado Squid Ink Stout;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Stout;Rio Salado Brewing Company;This beer has a creamy brown head that sits atop a dark, almost black beer. The aroma has notes of roasted coffee and chocolate. This has a smooth creamy taste, with a sharp burnt malt bitterness in the finish. The dark malt notes also contribute a certain acidity to this beer. This is pretty dry and light bodied, but pretty good too.
Rio Salado Squid Ink Stout;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Stout;Rio Salado Brewing Company;This beer poured a dark brown, almost black color with a nice tan head atop the beer. Aroma is roasted and nutty. Flavor is dominated by one flavor and one flavor only...tobacco. It's not in a bad way but tobacco is the most prevelant flavor in this stout. Nice body with the light carbonation very fitting for the style. Overall the best offering frin Rio Salado

Aroma of citrus and perhaps a whiff of coriander. Fairly light in body with a high degree of carbonation and then a distinct, underlying astringent tartness. 270707
Troublion la Goupille;Peseux, Switzerland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Troublion;Bottle. [Courtesy of Papsoe, another great tasting session] Wow this was a strange experience. As the bottle was opened, evidence of what appeared to be yeast covered the edge where the cap had been sitting. That was a first, very strange looking beer overall. Huge fizzy white head that just would not leave the glass. Heavy muddy looking orange color. Good display of lacework. Aroma of yeast, sour notes of cheese, strange sour herbal like notes as well. Some underlying malty sweetness. Medium bodied with a lively carbonation. Moderated sour flavor with light sweet notes. Herbal like acidic finish. More strange then good I would say. 27-07-07

Troublion la Goupille;Peseux, Switzerland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Troublion;"Bottled (thanks Bov!). Hazy yellow colour, much head while pouring, but vanishes quite fast. Some lace. Yeast, sourness, wheat and some caramel in aroma. Flavour is wheat, sour fruits and yeast. Quite ""flat"" flavoured. More a witbier with added sour fruits than a German Hefeweizen (which it apparently tries to be). Lots of spices in the aftertaste."
Troublion la Goupille;Peseux, Switzerland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Troublion;"Bottled (BB 08/2007) Beer wanted to come out from bottle, with force. Lots of foam ... Hazy orange color, later vanishing white head. Dry, medicine-like peppery aroma with hints of barnyard. Dusty, chalky and sour flavor with very foamy mouthfeel. Touch of citrus. This is from the horror movie ""when Hefeweizen went wrong"". Weird brewery."
Troublion la Goupille;Peseux, Switzerland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Troublion;"Hazy golden color; big frothy head. The dry aroma of the homebrewing yeast… Dry, thin, very poor homebrew, surely brewed with extracts…"
Troublion la Goupille;Peseux, Switzerland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Troublion;Hazy orangebrown colour. Fruity aroma with tones of cheese and honey. Tart hoppiness. Malty flavour with tones of cheese and afirm bitterness.
Troublion la Goupille;Peseux, Switzerland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Troublion;Bottled, thanks Bov! Cloudy orange. Fruity, cidery aroma with notes of spices. Poor mellow malt character. Short dusty finish. Peculiar and problematic.
Troublion Hydrante;Peseux, Switzerland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Troublion;Bottle. (thx papsoe) Hazy, orange pour with a beige, diminishing head. Sour, citrus-fruity nose. Citric, acidic flavor with a good fruityness. Quite lemony. Astringent, thin to medium body, with a lemony finish. The maltyness is completely overpowered by the sourness. Not past BB-date. Surely infected. (071006)

Troublion Hydrante;Peseux, Switzerland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Troublion;Bottled (thanks Bov!). Hazy brownish orange colour, small white head. Aroma is sour fruit and yeast along with some hay and glue. Flavour is yeast, sour fruits and hops. Something like witbier meets belgian sour and gueuze... Not totally hopeless though.
Troublion Hydrante;Peseux, Switzerland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Troublion;Bottled (BB 10/2007) Hazy nut brown, small head. Yeasty glue-like aroma with fruity tones. Wacko beer - funky ... yeast, paper, pepper, sourness, fermented grapes ... poor man’s gueuze??

Gettysbrew Blew Kilt;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;Foul. All of the beers I sampled from this brewer had the same sour malt taste. Not recommended!
Gettysbrew Blew Kilt;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;Had this at Manayunk. Not much aroma or flavor. Slight maltiness, but very off balance. I finished my sample, but did not go back for seconds on this one.
Gettysbrew Blew Kilt;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at the Manayunk Brew Extravaganza in Philly. Nasty!! Malt was way off on this one. Sour!! Couldn’t even finish a sample.
Gettysbrew Blew Kilt;Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Gettysbrew Restaurant & Brewery;I could barely tell this beer apart from the others I sampled, the only distingushable quality this had was a bit of a malt profile toward the finish & in the aftertaste, again like the others this was very undercarbonated & flat with a bit of a sour touch to it

Ryburn Stone Troff;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Old Ale;Ryburn Brewery;Cask Conditioned at a Wetherspoons. Dark brown with thin head. Sweet but sour beer with little condition. Some peachy fruitiness but overall a difficult pint.
ABC Best Bitter;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Fond memories of this, shame it’s not as good as it once was. Dirty coloured, decent bitter taste but no real arresting aroma or palate to it. Disappointing.

Rainbow Vaalea Lager;Iisalmi, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olvi;Bottled (BB 09(2004) Typical lager color with lively CO2 and mostly vanishing white head. Strange soapy and woody aroma. Very watery - typical Olvi - mouthfeel with very weak maltiness. This one really tastes like a bulk lager.
Rainbow Vaalea Lager;Iisalmi, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olvi;Typical lager color with medium, diminishing head. Slightly sweet, soapy, pinewood aroma. Quite sweet, a bit lemonade-like flavor - not bad, though. Light-bodied, but not watery, quite carbonated palate. Surprisingly drinkable and not at all skunky, cheap lager. The aroma is funny, though. I found no confirmation that this beer is brewed by Olvi, but that's most likely looking at the outlook of the best before date. It's probably the same stuff as Euroshopper Lager and maybe Ruuti III.
Power Plant Golden Ale;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;This poured a bright and light gold with a white head. The aroma was orange peels with some light breadcrust. The taste had old orange peels along with some bread crust. A nice light body, but could use a bit more body and hops.
Power Plant Golden Ale;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;Citrus hops, some malt sweetness, with some fruitiness. Golden and clear. Served with little head. Sweet caramel and a nice biscuit flavor that is balanced well with the hops. Seemed pretty flat. A average pale ale type beer.

Neuzeller Porter;Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Porter - Baltic;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;As Refugium Männerstolz at 7.1% ABV. Pours opaque deep brown with ruby highlights. Moderate off-white head. Low retention. Thin lacing. Dark malts on aroma. Caramel. Roast. Coffee. Chocolate. Esters and phenols stay far away (moving closer as the beer gets warmer). Bit vinous. The same picture while tasting. Light to medium body. Oily. Low to light bitterness. The review seems to be positive as I read it again. In fact this brew lacks power and smoothness that are IMO appropriate with Baltic porters.

Neuzeller Porter;Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Porter - Baltic;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;50cl bottle. Irony and extremely dry. Full of coffee. Not like EE porter should be.

Pours very dark brown, black coffee colour in the glass, weak hue of ruby against light. Head big but drops fast into a thin layer, light beige, leaves beautiful lacing. Nose is intense black bread crust, but also coffee and chocolate rich in cocoa, ash, and a tingle of spiciness. The roastiness kind of reminds me of fried vegetables, fried potatoes maybe. Taste semisweet - chocolaty-roasty-malty, dark fruits. Sweetens as it warms. Medium to full body, palate sticky and grainy, carbonation very much present but not dominant, mouthfeel smooth and soft. No alcohol detectable. Beautiful!
Neuzeller Porter;Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Porter - Baltic;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;Bottle @ De Tolly joogipood, Tartu, Estonia. Pours with light brown head that reduces quickly.

Symposium Ale (2004 Craft Brewers Conference);Escondido, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Stone Brewing;22oz bottle thanks to Ken. Pours out a crisp golden topped with a white head. Nose is oxidation unfortunately pit fruit sweetness and lots of malts. Taste is more of the old notes plenty of the sweet malts toffee some pit fruit. Thanks end this was sweet to try.
Symposium Ale (2004 Craft Brewers Conference);Escondido, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Stone Brewing;Bottle share, thanks indianared. deep golden colir, small white head. Sweet malty aroma, sort of syrupy. Tastes of sweet, cereal grains and malt. Faded hops. I bet this was pretty solid a decade ago. It’s old and awesome for a ticker.
Symposium Ale (2004 Craft Brewers Conference);Escondido, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Stone Brewing;Bottle from the cellar. Think I won this in a ratebeer contest 10 years ago. Aroma is sweet, with lots of toffee and candy sugar. Some cardboard oxidation is definitely present. Light banana esters. Moderate hazy honey colored body with a small, fairly weak off-yellow head. Starts with lots of oxidized wet cardboard. Has a little spiciness in the middle. Finishes with toffee, and scant esters. Body is a bit on the light side. Probably not the best idea to cellar this.
Symposium Ale (2004 Craft Brewers Conference);Escondido, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Stone Brewing;Aroma is that of oxidation. Lots of cardboard, newspaper and honey. Light Lemon pepper character hiding behind the oxidation. Stale malt notes. Pours a pale, cloudy golden orange with a moderate, slightly off white head with above average retention. Light lacing and small legs. Flavor is slightly better than the aroma because the oxidation is less prevalent, but it is still very strong. Rather sweet with some light spice notes and stale malt. Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium light carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. Overall a shadow of what it must have been. Really not good and a nice example of oxidation
Symposium Ale (2004 Craft Brewers Conference);Escondido, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Stone Brewing;Cloudy orange pour with a white head. Kind of a faded, oxidized nose. Sweet toffee and caramel malt, some cardboard, floral notes, pear, and yeast. Light spice notes and a hint of citrus. Taste has some cardboard notes as well. Sweet toffee and caramel, pear, apple, mild spice, and yeast. Very light citrus on the finish, maybe a touch of peach.
Symposium Ale (2004 Craft Brewers Conference);Escondido, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Stone Brewing;Shared by drabmuh, who loves Stone. Thanks Matt. The beer is mostly clear and light orange in color. The aroma brings faded pale ale, with some caramel malt, basement, light toffee. Not nearly as bad as I thought. That said, this is past its prime, unless you particularly enjoy old tasting brews. Mild alcohol with dank malt, maybe rain water. Like lapping up a puddle in a deserted California alley when you are too drunk to find fresh water. Fun. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 03-31-2012
Symposium Ale (2004 Craft Brewers Conference);Escondido, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Stone Brewing;Bottle courtesy of drabmuh at the Stone tasting. Served in a Stone goblet. Pours golden with a thin white head and some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings some pilsner malt plus a bit of yeasty spice and a touch of fruitiness. The flavor is a bit spicy with good carbonation carrying some flavor through, though honestly there’s not much left to this one. Body is light to medium with a somewhat-dry finish. Past its prime, no doubt. Still, thanks to Matt for finding this one and sharing.
Symposium Ale (2004 Craft Brewers Conference);Escondido, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Stone Brewing;Poured from bottle by Mr. Greg Koch himself at the start of Stone Winter Storm 2010. Poured a hazy yellow with small white head. Faint aroma of dusty yeast and some citrus (lemon). Flavor really shows the age as well with more dust and light citrus. I didn’t yet live in San Diego in 2004, but I wonder why three great San Diego breweries (Stone-Port-Alesmith) would opt for a Belgian-style ale rather than something on the hoppy side. Still, I was happy to try this -- thanks for sharing, Greg.
Symposium Ale (2004 Craft Brewers Conference);Escondido, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Stone Brewing;Pour from Greg the morning of winter storm 2010. Hazy gold/orange pour. The age on this beer is noticable. Fruit, bready malt, sweetness, cardboard, oxidation, and sourness.

Aroma of dark fruit, malt, spice and herbal. Taste of dark fruit, with a solid presence of malt in the background with some spice. Mild bitterness and a fairly dry finish. Medium body,smooth with a richness that increases as it warms. Enjoyable sipper, from a brewer that tends to lean towards british style ales. Worth checking out.
Galbraith's Resurrection;Auckland, New Zealand;Dubbel;Galbraith's Brewing Company;It’s a brave brewery who attempts a Belgian ale in New Zealand. So often it goes wrong or misses the mark. What impressed me was that blindfolded I would have known exactly what it was supposed to be. Appeared dark amber with a cream coloured skim of head. The persistent carbonation gave a certain sherbety character in my mouth along with plenty of Belgian style flavours: tarts, orchard fruit and allspice, dates and even a hint of musty basement. True to character and enjoyable in form. Well done.
Galbraith's Resurrection;Auckland, New Zealand;Dubbel;Galbraith's Brewing Company;very rich malty character with notes of caramel milk chocolate and cherries. Rich warming. Not massive complexity but well made and enjoyable. Alcohol is a bit present
Galbraith's Resurrection;Auckland, New Zealand;Dubbel;Galbraith's Brewing Company;"This is a truly lovely beer. Even if the ""Belgian"" word seems scary, don’t be afraid. This is a big soft rich warming beer with fruitiness, sweetness and subtle alcohol. Like a cold northern Christmas to a Pom (me). It’s a sipper, and it changes as it breathes and warms."

En bouche, le houblon est assez franc, et la céréale ressort dans un deuxième temps. Semble presque plate en bouche. Les arômes sont passables, mais un petit goût métallique persiste en bouche. Moins mauvais que ce qu'on m'avait dit, mais pas trop fou, et ne correspond pas aux caractéristiques de la bouteille, qui vante une mousse persistante et un pétillant marqué. Encore du travail...

L&L Alphand Stout;Vallouise, France;Stout - Milk / Sweet;L&L Alphand;Robe noire, nuances rouge sombre (limpide ?) si verre étroit. Mousse éphémère et moyenne. Nez sur les fruits noirs et le café grillé. En bouche, l'attaque est plutôt sur un léger fruité, plus du genre double que stout, mais assez vite, la torréfaction rattrape le coup, et la bouche est saturée de café et d'amertume brûlée. Pas mal de corps en fond, qui amène un certain équilibre. L'ensemble ne colle pas particulièrement au style, malgré l'indubitable côté empyreumatique. En fait, ce côté brûlé relève plutôt d'un effet de style que d'un réel travail des saveurs, d'où des arômes abrupts et pas très subtils (brûlé, pas grillé), posés sur une base qui ne fait pas très stout. Buvable sans être folle.
L&L Alphand Stout;Vallouise, France;Stout - Milk / Sweet;L&L Alphand;Pas une vrai stout, pas assez torréfié. Mais très désaltérante et agréable au chaud en terrasse

L&L Alphand Stout;Vallouise, France;Stout - Milk / Sweet;L&L Alphand;13/11/2015 @home - 75cl bottle I got from my boss, 10 years old. Hazy dark brown, blackish with nice light tanned head. First smell from the bottle was definetly old smell, from the glass light roast, coffee, thin. Taste is light roast & coffee but thin. not lasting. But anyway for a beer from 5° this old it still tased very good, just the beer as such isn’t that great I think.
L&L Alphand Stout;Vallouise, France;Stout - Milk / Sweet;L&L Alphand;The beer is sold as a stout, it is more like a porter genre beer, not enough taste for a stout. Despite that, it is a good beer, easily drinkable and refreshing.
L&L Alphand Stout;Vallouise, France;Stout - Milk / Sweet;L&L Alphand;Light roasted malt aroma. Slightly creamy in the mouth. Very watery. Out feels like a table beer. The one we give to children.

L&L Alphand Blanche;Vallouise, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;L&L Alphand;Robe blonde orangée, opalescente. Mousse éphémère, carbonation moyenne. Nez bien levuré,avec une légère note de banane. En bouche, banane plus présente, avec une touche acidulée de froment. Pas mal de corps, ce qui la rend assez corpulente pour une blanche à faible degré. Pas mal cependant, et reste rafraîchissante.
L&L Alphand Blanche;Vallouise, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;L&L Alphand;Clear orange in color with a short head. Subdued aroma that includes some coconut notes though I’m not sure why. Coconut on the palate as well, which demonstrates more qualities of a Wit than the nose. Still not great. Decent carbonation but soft on flavor. This beer is a month past code, but even fresh couldn’t be much more interesting.
L&L Alphand Blanche;Vallouise, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;L&L Alphand;Bottled. Pours a clear amber color with a large fizzy white head. Good head retention. Aroma of floral and herbal notes with pale malts. The taste is sweet malts caramel and faint herbal notes. Medium bodied. Never would have guess this was a witbier, but it was definitely the blanche we opened.
L&L Alphand Blanche;Vallouise, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;L&L Alphand;Bottle. Hazy yellow color, small white coca-cola head. Aroma of lemon, apricot, peach. Taste is lemony straw. Little carbonation. Hmm.
L&L Alphand Blanche;Vallouise, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;L&L Alphand;75cl flip-top bottle, thanks Céccile for bringing it back from France, shared with Ajax25g. Dorée, brumeuse, col fin blanc, disparaissant très vite. Pour une bière blanche de style belge, cette dernière est vraiment trompeuse sur la couleur. Arôme malté, grains rappelant un peu une pâte à pâtissier dans la levure. En bouche, le fruité est très modéré voire quasi absent de ce que l’on s’imagine pour une blanche. Je note un fruité léger avec une absence d’épices, le tout marqué par un peu d’orange. Le profile belge est absent, le tout rappelant plus une levure allemande avec une pointe d’ester pomme. Reste fruitée, fleurie avec en fin de bouche un côté mielleux fleuri. Le tout est fade, et garde ce profile très français. Pas mauvaise, mais terriblement banale.
L&L Alphand Blanche;Vallouise, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;L&L Alphand;Bottled. Nice colour, pleasant in mouth. A bit disapointed by the taste, i was hoping something more spicy. A good beer though.
L&L Alphand Blanche;Vallouise, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;L&L Alphand;Bottle. bottled stated that it needed to be consumed before January 08. Hmm. It certainly was not much of a itbeer. It poured with a much darker color, albeit with a nice head. Flavors and aroma both were dominated by sourness, some funkiness but not much else. perhaps that is close to an aged fantome? Certainly, some bacterial infection might have been present.
L&L Alphand Blanche;Vallouise, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;L&L Alphand;Swing top bottle(750ml). -bought all 4 Alphand beers in a local souvenir and liquor store in Risoul, Hautes Alpes, France. Costs ridiculous high 5.50€ per bottle. This one worth every cent that I’ve paid for it. For sure the best Alphand beer. Hazy orange coloured, medium sized firm white head, perfumey fresh fruity and yeasty nose. The aroma is wheaty and fruity (lemon, orange, tangerine) with slight honey and spicy notes. Nice lemony acidity in the finish. Refreshing and highly enjoyable brew.
L&L Alphand Blanche;Vallouise, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;L&L Alphand;0.75l bottle courtesy of and shared with ozujsko (thanks!). This poured a hefeweizen like hazy orange colour with a medium to big sized head that went away slowly. It looked like a hefe but it sure smelled like a wit. Fruit yoghurty nose, hints of yeast, maybe bubblegum, bananas and brown sugar. Interesting, but not terribly pleasant. The taste was surprisingly nice. Yoghurty lacticity, pleasant and refreshing lemony acidity, heavy bubblegum. Overall, surprisingly pleasant. One of the best wits I’ve had. Guess both me and ozujsko will go against the grain.
Flossmoor Station Break the Curse Weizen Bock;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the BBB in Augusta: Rich dark golden color with a thick off-white head. Heavy caramel sweet and wheaty aroma leads into a complex yeasty body with good sweet malty balance. Finishes with black pepper and citrus spice. A very good weizenbock that's just a step below Aventinus, but with some aging, who knows...
Flossmoor Station Break the Curse Weizen Bock;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Wow. This is an amazing Weizen Bock. It's got everything that a good hefeweizen and then doubled. There's more banana (but not overripe or out of control). There's more clove (but not overwhelming). There's most wheat flavor. There's more creaminess in the body. It even manages to retain some of the refreshing citrus qualities and even manages to keep a little lightness compared to its size that make this a surprising beer.
Flossmoor Station Break the Curse Weizen Bock;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;This was so tasty, especially on a hot day such as, the Saturday of the Border Beer Bust. Full of yeasty notes, the aroma is full of bananas. The appearance is very cloudy and unfiltered, and slightly darker than I expected. This is the perfect summer session beer. Perfectly balanced. The flavor is rich and creamy, and just tangy and citrusy enough to quench your thirst, lots of clove and banana with a malt character to back it up. A good solid choice.
Flossmoor Station Break the Curse Weizen Bock;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;"Draft. First impression is a big boquet o' bananas, which can turn me off. But There's also a coppery, cloudy body and a thin, lacy head. A very tasty caramel roast malt note. The usual German hop profile balances enough to cancel itself out. A nice soft citrusy wheat texture makes this very enjoyable and easy to sip as a session beer. Note: Matt put this beer up as a baseball theme, along with ""Pale Hose Pale."" I only had this Cubby-themed beer first because the server said this was running low. There's no curse, no goat, no ball... the Cubs just s**k."

Filter coffee fizzy brown pour, cola effervescence dominates in foam. Immediate cola lemonade and Vita Cola-like guarana forward aromas, nothing beery. Ashy Köstritzer roast mixes in well with the cola, adding a bitter tinge, but then the trademark metallics come through, thinning out the cola. Still refreshing and in se a good idea for a Radler that would warrant a better execution.

Lengthwise Golden Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lengthwise Brewery;Pale yellow gold. Light grain in the aroma, but it is minimal at best. Flavors are light and fruity. A bit of sweet malt, but it is minimal too. Not much going on except thirst quenching here.
Lengthwise Golden Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lengthwise Brewery;"Sample at the brewpub: Pours clear golden with tiny bubbles and a thin white head. Thin rings of ""V""-shaped lacing. Light aroma of hops and fruit. Light-bodied and somewhat crisp with a decent amount of hops and malt flavor, along with a touch of fruit. The finish is hoppy but thin. Decent for what it is - a thirst-quencher."
Lengthwise Oktoberfest;Bakersfield, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lengthwise Brewery;On tap @ the brewpub. Clear medium orange with a minimal off-white head, no retention. Aroma of toasty biscuit and caramel malts with typical lager yeast behind. Flavor is much the same, though pretty dry with a decent earthy bitterness in the finish, peaking @ a 3. Low prickly carbonation with a thin watery body. OK at best, the overhopped-ness was kinda nice.

Buckhead Redwood Amber;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Came from the tap with medium carbonation, and a murky brown appearance. Aroma heavy on nutty and caramel with some hops. The taste was woody, nutty, and semi-sweet. The beer had a dry aftertaste and a medium mouthfeel. It is hard to place this beer into a style firmly. I think of it as a cross between a brown ale, and an amber ale.

Poured a clear pale amber colour with a one- to two-finger white foamy head that retained OK and laced OK. Carbonation very low with small bubbles. Aroma of sweet moderately strong hops (not as aromatic as other pale ales I’ve tasted) with citrus/grapefruit and possibly passionfruit.

BJ's Springbock;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;"Pours a amber color with a very nice creamy head and good lacing throughtout. Aroma is that of fresh malt, just like an operating brewery. Flavor has that same ""fresh"" malt flavor, including some intersting yeast notes as well. I also caught some very pleasant, but light, cheese flavors as well. Body is silky and nice."
Waiheke Island Baroona R.O.C.;Auckland, New Zealand;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Waiheke Island Brewery;Tasted 2006. Features are exactly as in the description. Cloudy with an interesting feel. Rye & wheat dominant. A little bit of a bad homebrew texture, with a sweeter orange finish.
Waiheke Island Baroona R.O.C.;Auckland, New Zealand;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Waiheke Island Brewery;I’m not sure why they have this and the wheat on, as they’re basically the same beer save for the rye, but I digress. Pale, slightly hazy beer with a faint orange tint. Spicey aromas of orange peel, coriander, and a bit of wheat/rye spiciness. Palate is a bit watery. Distinct spicy hop flavour and aroma in here that actually complements the brewing spices used.
Waiheke Island Baroona R.O.C.;Auckland, New Zealand;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Waiheke Island Brewery;"I was expecting some sort of rye-wit, but got something like a watery version of the ""original"" with a bit of coriander. Really couldn't detect the rye. completely clear bright yellow. aroma is an interesting mix of cascade and coriander. taste is bland, clean lagery malt with slight spice. it's a bit too cleaned up to be interesting."
Galbraith's Bohemian Pilsner;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Galbraith's Brewing Company;Tap at the Ale House. Totally clear golden with white head. Pils malts, cereals, soft creamy, light grassy and a hint of apricot and orange. Under medium sweet and almost medium bitter. Medium bodied with crisp feel. Better than I expected, this is well made.
Galbraith's Bohemian Pilsner;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Galbraith's Brewing Company;Nice grassy, straw bitterness on the flavour, less on the aroma, which as a very light whiff of fruit. Looks like a pilsner, tastes like a pilsner, smells like a pilsner. That’s an achievement that few New Zealand pilsners have fulfilled so far, no matter how taste they could be.
Galbraith's Bohemian Pilsner;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Galbraith's Brewing Company;On tap at Meximama in Napier. Slight fruity aroma. Gold color with good head - plenty of carbonation. Medium bitterness and a crisp finish. Went well with the spicy Octopus tacos I was eating at the time.
Galbraith's Bohemian Pilsner;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Galbraith's Brewing Company;Hoppy aroma with malty background. In taste even more hoppy, less malty. But this are like traditional German or Czech old fashion hops. No fruity, no resin notes, just pure green classic hops. Bitterness might be a bit bigger since it’s a pilsener. Clear golden color, small white head, nice lacing. Drinkable, it’s ok. Very classical.

Galbraith's Bohemian Pilsner;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Galbraith's Brewing Company;On tap or cask @ Galbraiths’, Auckland. New Zealand holiday 2011-12. Old notes. The aroma is a bit citric fruity and slightly grainy. Clear, golden coloured beer with a thin, white head. The taste is light-moderate bitter, has hints of grassy hops, is a bit citric, ’pale malty’. Crisp, clean and nice.
Galbraith's Bohemian Pilsner;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Galbraith's Brewing Company;On my visit to Galbraith I took a pour of three cask ales and found them all acidic and bile-like, one of them fooled me and I got a half pint to sit with but it didn’t take long to find the stomach acid in that beer either. Sadly the Bohemian Pils was no different: subtly acidic and sour with plant matter / leaf astringency, lemon, cheese rind, laundry detergent and armpit sweat... I mean it’s like animal sweat, musk, feces, the whole game-y experience of walking up to a pungent deer bed. Carbonation goes totally acidic like stomach bile, there’s solvent overload on the back palate. Scratching my head how the Munich Lager (Pilsner) from bottle is worthy of a mid-to-high 3 while the Bohemian Pils fared so poorly.
Galbraith's Bohemian Pilsner;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Galbraith's Brewing Company;Draft at the source. Clear golden color, white edge head. Aroma of white pepper and straw. Taste is clean and crisp.

Fairly light body, crisp and quite refreshing. Enjoyable beer that is quite sessionable.
Galbraith's Bohemian Pilsner;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Galbraith's Brewing Company;light grassy, moderate amount of biscuit character and a moderately bitter finish. A touch unbalanced and sour but still a great beer

Chant Du Loup Lupus Ale;Canteleu-Rouen, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Chant Du Loup;Looks pretty gay, that’s a three. Weak aromas of lemon and straw/cereal. Super fizzy with a cheap orange juice flavour. Quite citric lemoniness and an almost tongue numbing carbonation. Theyeast is most apparent with floury white baps springing to mind. Drinkable but not hugely pleasant. Worth a rate but not a retry.
Chant Du Loup Lupus Ale;Canteleu-Rouen, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Chant Du Loup;Bottled. Golden with a large white fluffy head. Foaming and fizzing Farm yard aroma, hey and manure.

Chant Du Loup Lupus Ale;Canteleu-Rouen, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Chant Du Loup;Fresh from the lagering tank at the brewery, and then bottle conditioned at home. Patrick Expert, the brewer, calls this a Blonde. He was very keen to practise his English, so information was sometimes vaque or not completely understood. I didn't get the full ingredients for this beer, but he doesn't use lager malt. He uses hallertau and spatz hops and a dried yeast. His brewery training was done somewhere around Herefordshire. He is very proud of the fact that he learned his craft in England. All the beers are lagered for a full four weeks, and he only brews ten times a year - most of his output going to supermarkets or sold from the premises which can be visited after 5.30 during week-day evenings. He let me sample some of this from the tank, even though he felt it was still green and needed another week to fully mature. There wasn't a huge difference to what I'm now drinking from the bottle - it was less fizzy and with a more pronounced bitterness, but it had the same green apple flavour that I took at the time to signify a beer not quite ready. This is a light, refreshing brew with a crisp tartness. Fresh, delicate and very tasty. I'm not familiar with the style, so I'll term it a Blonde as the brewer does.

Kuhnhenn Daves Dark Strong Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kuhnhenn Brewing;This draft brew from the brewery poured a small head of mostly diminishing finely sized bubbles that left behind a good lacing. The body was a transparent uncarbonated copper color. It had a mild malty aroma and the mouth feel was smooth and mildly tingly. The flavor was also malty with a mild brown beer finish. A nice all around ale.
Kuhnhenn Daves Dark Strong Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kuhnhenn Brewing;On tap. A dark brown color with a decent head. Malty aroma. Some chocolate hints.

A creamy and smooth ivory head with fine sized bubbles that mostly diminished. Uncarbonated, transparent and a orange-red hue. The aroma was malty, hoppy and some clove notes were observed.

Kuhnhenn Daves Dark Strong Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kuhnhenn Brewing;2004 draught. Pours a mildly hazy medium earthy brown. Small off-white head. Aroma has a bit of malt in it and some very dry smelling hops. Flavor is very wet, lots of brown malts, moderately sugary with some out of place bitterness. The alpha hops do not go too well with this brown style ale, and the wateriness does not help the situation. Not sure what they were aiming for with this one. Low carbonation, medium to medium light body, very watery texture.
Clarks Rams Revenge;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);First tasted this at the Paisley Beer Festival in April 2004. Cask, gravity dispense. Clear ruby red in colour with an open white head which disappeared quickly. Thin mouthfeel and poor lacing. Strong wood smoke and sulphurous notes in the long aroma. Mixed malts deliver a rich maltloaf base with roast smokey malt, syrupy dates, raisins, chocolate powder, toffee and molasses. Very little in the way of hop resins evident in the aftertaste. Rich malt returns in the smooth sweet caramel laced finish. An excellent session ale.
Clarks Rams Revenge;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);Rich malty character, surprisingly sweet with a caramel hint, fairly bitter finish. Good beer.

Clarks Rams Revenge;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);Cask (handpump), Three Legged Mare, York, October 2006. One of those interesting beers that doesn’t fit neatly into any particular style category. Attractive dark chestnut colour. Lots of roast malt in the aroma. Flavour has some sweetish fruit with hints of chocolate and tobacco. Fairly smooth mouthfeel, although there’s a modest sharp bite that gives rise to a rather bittersweet overall feel. Went down very nicely.

Clarks Rams Revenge;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);Cask conditioned @ South Western Arms Soton. Fruity toffee and mildly roasty malts. The pleasant roasty toasty flavours are enough to keep this drinkable but the sweetish toffee makes this seem a bit cloying.

Dogfish Head Liquor de Malt;Milton, Delaware, United States;Malt Liquor;Dogfish Head Brewery;White capped 40 oz bottle with the paper bag. Mostly drank from the bottle but poured a bit out for my homies and to review. Hazyish light brown with a massive tan foam head. Nose is oxidation, bubble gum, sweet caramel, and corn. Taste is light caramel malts and faded hops. Has a certain character that I get from a lot of aged DFH beers. A sort of oxidized hop oil sweetness. Full mouth feel. Despite it’s age and the abv, it’s actually quite drinkable.
Dogfish Head Liquor de Malt;Milton, Delaware, United States;Malt Liquor;Dogfish Head Brewery;It’s funny, I have 3 different notes on this beer. Going to go for the latest vintage as that is the one I enjoyed the most. Pours malt liquor yellow with a white head. Corn forward aroma, a bit of grape drink, some prickly alcohol notes.

Dogfish Head Liquor de Malt;Milton, Delaware, United States;Malt Liquor;Dogfish Head Brewery;OLD rating just found. Pours yellow golden, yea I poured it. Smells grassy, corny. Tastes of cheap beer. Clever... in the fact that they made a cheap beer that enticed people to overpay.
Dogfish Head Liquor de Malt;Milton, Delaware, United States;Malt Liquor;Dogfish Head Brewery;Bottle (with the brown paper bag) from backlog notes 07. Pours a clear dark golden color with a small off white film. The aroma and flavor have swet grainy malts, corn, some alcohol at 7%, not so sweet its cloying, but nothing much else is going on.

Dogfish Head Liquor de Malt;Milton, Delaware, United States;Malt Liquor;Dogfish Head Brewery;"I know it is stupid... but this is one of my long time whales... Tiklmelmo hooked me up with 2!! Jason is a stellar trader for sure... This is from the 2nd release in 2010. This has been in my fridge since I received it... I cracked it to share with my brother and a work buddy who claims to be a ""Malt Licka"" aficionado.. This was the best of the bunch. Pours clear dark gold on initial pours... but later they were sorta hazy golden... no lacing... short lasting white head. Nose is clean maltiness... something that I guess is corn... smells like some bigger micro cream ales I’ve had over the years.... Flavor has a very lite splash of citrus/lighter floral hops that let you know this is not your every day drunk punch... pale malts and some corny goodness (i think) .... some booze for sure just to brand the style into your brain. Again.. the body and carbonation are akin to a bigger cream ale... medium with a lite yet frothy carbonation.. definitely interesting."

I had no intention of drinking last night but, as I was passing I popped in out of curiosity and, they had a Pictish beer on DAMNITT! Hazy gold with a nice white head.

The taste is much the same, sweet malts with a nice clean & dry bitter grassy hop finish. Very well balanced and drinkable, everything comes together perfectly... Another triumph from one of my favorite UK brewers! I suggest those of you below give this another try, as It sounds that you got a bunk cask at GBBF 2007...Pictish FTW!

Dogwood Winter Ale 2003 (Whiskey-barrel aged);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);A rare find recently at the 5 Seasons. A random offering was made and had the privilege of sampling. Apparently this was the 5SN Winterjack that was once on tap up in Alpharetta. Deep rust color. Sweet aroma of cherries, vanilla, and some spiciness. Flavors are of a well made malt character along with some chocolate notes. Finishes off with a sweet flavor that resembles White Grape juice, but without the tartness, then add some smooth vanilla aftertaste.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2003 (Whiskey-barrel aged);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Has this at the brewery on tap. A nice dark red color with a wonderful spicy aroma. The malty backbone is perfect for winter and the hints of whiskey are just right.

Dogwood Winter Ale 2003 (Whiskey-barrel aged);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);On tap at 5 Seasons North. They are calling it Winterjack. Delicious beer. Poured a still, cloudy, brown...looked like really dirty water. Smelled like wood, burbon, and some vanilla notes. The beer was amazingly full and slick in my mouth. The burbon taste was almost too much. I’m not a big fan of burbon, so I imagine for those of you who are it isn’t at all too much. Chocolate and toffee notes. The belgian dubble was there in the finish right before the real finish which was more burbon. What a delight. I had a day to kill and drove over thinking I’d get some very good beer brewed in Georgia, but didn’t expect this.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2003 (Whiskey-barrel aged);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottle from Walt I think. Thanks again for this one.

Getting past its prime but still a very nice treat to enjoy,thanks again Walt.

Huge sweet vanilla whisky bourbon aroma, with just enough of the base yeasty dubbel to poke through. Sweet oaky whisky flavors, with a backing of yeasty sweet and fruity malts. Fairly full beer. Damn this is a fantastic beer.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2003 (Whiskey-barrel aged);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);I can’t believe 2 things. 1) that dogwood doesn’t exist anymore as i love everything by them so far, and 2) that i forgot to have the decadent at Kp’s when it was on tap! dammit! anyways, this beer was excellent. it was smooth and warm and definitely had that jack daniels feel to it :) very good variation on the winter. i really wish these guys were still around and brewing.

Aroma of malt, hops, and fruit. Tastes very fruity with a crisp, smooth, malt and hop finish. This is the first pilsener I've ever had where I noticed some fruity esters of this magnitude, and I applaud Valley Forge for the innovation. It adds an amazing complexity to this stunning beer.

Selins Grove Organic Pale Ale;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;There is a decent amount of hops and not a very large malt backround which leads to the beer being a little unbalanced and piney.
Selins Grove Organic Pale Ale;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Hops very mellow and herbal. Nice and bitter up front and in the middle the malt gives a fruity undertone like apples and berries. Finish is strangely chalky and dry. A bit unbalanced, I think. The hops are good but the malt bill needs tweaking...?

Im Antrunk ist das Bier schön süffig-süßlich und toll hefig-mild. Diese sehr angenehme hefig-milde Note setzt sich auch im Hauptteil fort, wo noch eine ganz leicht würzige, aber interessnt-angenehme Note hinzu kommt. Im Mund breitet sich ein weicher und ganz leicht malziger Hefe-Weizen Geschmack aus – genau, wie er sein soll. Leichte Anklänge an gelbe Früchte spürbar – Birne oder heller Pfirsich. Der Nachgeschmack ist lang, mild und aromenreich. Es ist eine Fortsetzung der Aromenvielfalt der Hauptteils, die aber im Nachgeschmack unter dem weichen Einfluss der Hefe noch um einiges milder wirken. Hinzu kommt eine sehr angenehme Süße, die sich sehr gut mit der milden Hefe und den übrigen Aromen verbindet! --> Klasse Hefeweizen. Keine störenden Aromen spürbar. Süffig und vollmundig. Sehr zu empfehlen! Test vom 24.1.2009, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 12,13,12,13,12,12 - 12,30

Landshuter Hochzeits Weisse;Landshut, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Landshuter Brauhaus;"Sorry for the german rating, but this is a lousy rating from my ""newbie"" time (2007-2009), and it’s not worth of being translated. I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! Ins Glas ergießt sich ein dunkel-zitrusgelbes Weizen mit guter Trübung und flacher, feiner Cremekrone. Der Geruchstest fällt hefig-nelkig aus, dezent süßer Einschlag. Der Antrunk zeigt sich nelkig-würzig, wieder mit leicht süßlichen Nuancen im Hintergrund, etwas Frucht kommt raus (Pfirsisch, Aprikose??). Der weitere Verlauf bleibt angenehm hefig und gut sahnig, das würzig-nelkige Aroma dominiert dieses Weizen. Zwar kommt ab und an ein süßer Ton raus, der kann sich aber zu keinem Zeitpunkt gut durchsetzen."

En bouche, pas mal de sucre (plus que dans mon souvenir, ou alors ma tolérance a évolué) et du pain grillé, un peu d'épices. Agréable, mais un poil trop de sucre.
Pelforth George Killian's;Mons-en-Baroeul, France;Red Ale - Irish;Pelforth (Heineken);Bottle @ home. Nothing really special but a not expensive purchase from supermaket
Pelforth George Killian's;Mons-en-Baroeul, France;Red Ale - Irish;Pelforth (Heineken);Hmm, not a big fan of this one. Caramel aroma is too much present in my opinion, and the overall feeling is way too sugary. It’s decent, especially if you like fruity beers and such, but you’d better know what to expect to really enjoy it. Alcohol level is average beside that. Best served with a meal, not that great alone. PARTIALLY APPROVED BY TAVERNY’S BLACK METAL CREW!

Hanby Scorpio Porter;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Porter;Wem Brewing;Tasted this porter in The Esquire House, Glasgow (JDW) in September 2008. Cask, handpump dispense. Ruby black in colour with a thin creamy white head. Strange lingering aroma of teak oil, long in intensity. Resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Dark malts give a roasted grain flavour which fades into a dry bitter chocolate, mocha and crushed walnut note. Dry spicy hop resins compliment the dry malt flavours well in the bitter aftertaste. Finish is quite dry with sour berry fruits and oak cask in evidence. A decent session porter though but too dry for my tastes.
Hanby Scorpio Porter;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Porter;Wem Brewing;25th September 2008 On tap somewhere - maybe Market Porter. Fairly typical porter differentiated by a litlle more sourness. Easy drinking.

Pours a very murky brown with a tan head. This had a sweaty and rather cheesy nose, not despearately unpleasant though not a vote winner either.

Hanby Scorpio Porter;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Porter;Wem Brewing;"Handpulled cask at several JDW pubs in the Harrow/Watford area over the last month. Deep brown with good tam head. I’ve tried two distinct versions of this beer. The first time it was choclatey with a hint of coffee and moderately sweet. The next time I tried it, it was distinctly sour but with no ""off"" pointers. I’ve had it twice since and the sourness persists, a characturistic which I believe was indicitive of the porters of old.. On reading other people comments it seems that two versions of this beer are produced. I,ve tried both in the last month and frankly prefere the non sour version though both were very enjoyable."
Hanby Scorpio Porter;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Porter;Wem Brewing;Cask at Spoons, Milton Keynes. Very darb brown with a small off white head. Sour but restrained vinegary aroma. Taste is sweet and gentle with a spicy edge of sourness that gives this beer considerable interest. Its as if someone has tried to enliven a dullish porter by mixing it with an astringent cider. I enjoyed the result.
Hanby Scorpio Porter;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Porter;Wem Brewing;Cask at the alfred herring.

Growers Extra Dry Apple;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;Bottle @ Dusty's, Whistler Creekside. Crisp and light, with a boozy aftertaste. Flowery nose, very pale in colour. Should go nicely with a bitter fortifier.
Growers Extra Dry Apple;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;I am still searching for a decent cider. I am wary about this one. Very, very pale straw colour with no head. Slight champagne aroma. Also has a very champagne taste, which my palate cannot pick apart for flavours. It’s just cheap champagne, probably made from apples. Not bad per se, but it needs something... I just don’t know what.
Growers Extra Dry Apple;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;2L bottle... why oh why did I buy this. Clear with slight straw tinge. Bubbly. Nose has a slight white wine character mixed with the sugar. A bit dry/white wine-ish upfront but sweetness gains in mid palate and by the end you know it’s artificial flavouring and sweeteners. Not crisp. Better than Okanagan, at least. Cider’s so cheap to make, you wonder what’s the point of changing it to an alcopop.
Growers Extra Dry Apple;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;Bottle to tulip I’m not sure what to call this aroma, which is unusual for me as I try to stick to a ’beer’ until I can glean the aromas coming off it. I’m not even sure I get apple, maybe green apple or granny smith, but I’m getting an almost vinegar, and strangely feces. Not a great place to start. This is a clear, slightly tinged yellow, with no head and no carbonation. Taste is apple with celery and cucumber and syryup. Refreshing yes, but strange.
Growers Extra Dry Apple;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;Rating #871 - December 29, 2013 - Bottle 7%. Clear, very pale yellow colour, weakly carbonated. Aroma is sweet apples. Taste is bubbly sweet, alcohol very well disguised, this could pass for juice. Dry, peppery aftertaste - not really pleasant. Not much to distinguish from other ciders or pear ciders.
Growers Extra Dry Apple;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;Bottle at Molly’s Reach, Gibsons Almost transparent look. Not so dry as the name Brut would suggest, it’s indeed just a semi-sweet alco-pop, with very little artificial apple aroma and flavor, and very little interest.
Growers Extra Dry Apple;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;"(Previously Tasted, Home, New 341mL Bottle, Lager Glass, 7% ABV, Chilled, 08/06/12. #43.) Appearance (2/5): Pours a perfectly clear, sparkling yellow tint; like ginger ale. Very pale. Absolutely no head. Aroma (4/10): Sharp apple with lemon, wine, and a musty note. Taste (4/10): Sharp acidity to begin with, then that chemical-dryness that is so common in cheaper dry cider. A little bitterness in the finish. Palate (3/5): Light body, lively carbonation, dry texture, and a slightly sticky, dry finish. Overall (9/20): Not terrible. If you don’t like dry cider you wont like this. Quite harsh and unrefined. But it still tastes fresh like all Growers cider, and as a result ends up pretty average. There are better choices. Drinkability: 4/5. Character: 1/5. Buy Again: No."
Growers Extra Dry Apple;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;341mL bottle, pours pale yellow. Simple, light apple flavour and aroma. Not so good!
Growers Extra Dry Apple;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;"Pours the colour of a light ginger ale, with zero head and lots of big visible carbonation bubbles. Aroma of cheap apple juice (not apples). As advertised, it’s ""extra dry"", and it certainly doesn’t taste like apples. But that said, I don’t mind it. The crispness and carbonation makes it very refreshing . Certainly not the first cider I’d reach for but if in some (admittedly unusual) situation it was a choice between a bland pale lager or this...I’d take this."
Rock Bottom La Jolla Mary Jane Strong Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rock Bottom La Jolla;(Draft: 2005 San Diego Festival of Beer in San Diego, CA) So, I’ve had this a few times before this festival and have never actually rated it. Unfortunately, the conditions were better at the brewery than at this festival, so I’ll have to sample this up in La Jolla at some point. But at least this sample tonight isn’t very good. The beer smells moderately sweet but also a bit stinky, so not a good start. Hoppy and bitter, but there’s not enough balance from malt for my tastes, especially since it’s supposed to be an Imperial Red and malts are just way too subdued. It’s very grainy and mildly sweet, but by the finish, that is wiped out and I’m left with a finish that is just too bitter to be pleasant. Medium body with a somewhat crisp finish. Light amber color, slightly cloudy. The off-white head pours small and fades to a wide ring. I definitely remember liking this beer more in the past, but this sample is what it is: not very good.
Rock Bottom La Jolla Mary Jane Strong Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rock Bottom La Jolla;Draft at LA Jolla. I like hops, and I like this beer. Dark red with very little head. Big hop aroma with some malt. Taste is strongly hops, but unlike an IPA, has a complementary sweet sherry taste from the cask aging. Great bitter finish. Solid beer.
Rock Bottom La Jolla Mary Jane Strong Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rock Bottom La Jolla;On tap, Rock Bottom La Jolla, as Mary Jane Imperial Red. Cloudy red/brown pour, small head. Aroma is bitter hops, decent malt backing, some light caramel. Medium/thick body, strong hop profile, nice malt balance feel, but mostly hops present. Long bitter aftertaste. Not too bad.
Rock Bottom La Jolla Mary Jane Strong Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rock Bottom La Jolla;On Draught at RB-La Jolla: Pours a muddy reddish/brown color with a medium off-white head. Aroma is malty and alcohol. The +7% alcohol is definetely showing through in this beer. Flavor is malt and alcohol with the hop bitterness evident in the flavor. Body is medium with a nice long finish. Decent beer.

Clear pale straw with a soapy head that was as white as new fallen snow . Decent sticky lace for a chepo lager. unfortunately that’s where the fun ends, if only it could have tasted half as good as it looked. aroma was urine soaked grain with a metalic scent, possibly from the can. Bland, watery, hints of cereal and aluminum. clean finish. not recommended.
Culebra Lager;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Can. This beer showed up hidden in ice amongst Mexican bottled beer at a Mexican lunch prepared by one of the Lucasfilm chefs. I guess they thought Culebra was Mexican. I ended up having two cans of the stuff and they were different. The first was better and actually had a nice spritzy hopiness to it. The second was more of a standard bland lager. Aroma for both was bland, watery lager. Clear, light gold in color with an average sized white head and nice lace. Some bite and some nice hops. When its on, not totally unlike Grain Belt Premium.
Culebra Lager;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Alot better than alot of south of the border beers, I could choke it down better than alot of the crap from S America! I enjoyed it as much as corona. I’d drink it again if it was cheap or free!

Culebra Lager;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;this here beer spit out swillish aromas and tasted fuelish, sour, but not as adjuncty as it could be. And thats all the comment this beer deserves.
Culebra Lager;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;Pours a typical golden yellow color. Has a real sweet corn flavor. This is better than most beers from south of the border. Not bad for $2.99 a sixer at BevMo. It didn’t seem to be selling that well, but’s it’s better than some brews that are more expensive.
Culebra Lager;Guatemala City, Guatemala;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria Centro Americana;"Dang were does my local ""Grocery Outlet"" find all tese cheapo Guatemalan lagers!!. The aroma was pretty non-descript only borderline nasty( probably due to this being in a can,..though id does smell faintlly of sweaty socks. Appearance is a ghastly pale yellowlike canola oil..with a white head. Flavour..mmlike flat Sprite, a sickenlingly sweet aftertaste..that sticks around way to long. Horrid on the palate. Why I but these I do not know..Im a sucker for punishment in the form of cheap Guatamalan lagers!"

Ringnes Lys Lager;Oslo, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);"(500 ml can). There's a price war on cheap swill going on in Norway at the moment, and this lager is probably meant to be Ringnes' contribution. I'm not sure where they actually brew this, no mentioning is made of the Reinheitsgebot, so it's probably full of adjuncts. It's just another pale industrial lager, not unlike the ones made by Grans/Harboe/Faxe. The brewery's recommendation ""to be served ice cold"" is an appropriate warning. Totally forgettable. At least they had the decency not to call it a pilsener."

This truly is a multinational enterprise. But all this effort was a beautiful waste of time as the result is completely useless. But presumably an attempt to produce a lager ""Mexican-style"". Decent pilsener golden colour, bubbly head that bubbles away in no time and completely vanishes. Sweet, sticky mouthfeel that indicates brewing cereal although the label claims the opposite.

The Tap Leatherlips IPA;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;"From Aug 2007 I got this bottle in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks, John! Pours from 12oz bottle a cloudy light gold with a nice big head of foam that fades after a while but every time I take a sip and put my glass down, there's *another* close to 1"" layer staring at me from the glass and...there's lots of sticky lacing. The smell is very hoppy with notes of pine and citrus. The taste, well, it's hoppy as hell with big pine and grapefruit profiles but there must be just enough malt in there because I don't find it overly bitter except right near and through the finish. Man, that grapefruit is ruling it now and it makes me want to take sip after sip and at only 5%abv, I'm definitely going to indulge myself. Btw, if I want to bring out the bitterness more, I just swish it in my mouth and then, my mouth puckers a bit. lol. This is a damn good IPA and a fun one to drink. How do I know it's fun? After every sip, I find myself smiling. ;^) Bottom line: This is my first Haverhill brew and boy am I impressed!"
The Tap Leatherlips IPA;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Smells of malt, with maybe a slight hint of hops. Nice golden amber color. For an IPA this doesn't have much hop flavor, just malt really

Blindverkostet würde ich nicht sofort auf ein dunkles Bier tippen. Wenn man mal einen Abend zum Starkbiertrinken geht, ist der Kulinator eine sehr gute Wahl, weil man sich daran nicht so schnell ""abtrinkt"". Allerdings bei 7 % Alk hat das natürlich Folgen.

Sweet aroma of dark, roasted malts. Also some dark fruits, plums, raisins... Taste is slightly bitter upfront, just a bit of sweetness somewhere in the middle. Aftertaste is even more bitter. Just dark, roasted malts in the taste, no fruit at all but cannot say I don’t like it. Medium body with light carbonation. Alcohol is present but not offensive in any way. Overall this is a decent Doppelbock. Not as complex as others and not very balanced but it’s not a bad beer. If you like roasty and malty beers that lean more towards the bitter side, you’ll like this one.

Taste is a bit too clean/sterilized, a bit of minerals, basic crisp cereals, light notes of yellowed grass. This beer is clean, crisp and well balanced beer but everything is just too toned down. Too clean and flavourless to be bad, but also anything to excite the taste buds. A big disappointment considering this is a pils from a brewery that makes another pils that is excellent (Hutthurmer Premium Pils). Old bottle? Hard to say when you buy it in a bar. The taste was about as strong as a new-age vegetarian with a bad flu.

Riedenburger Edel Bock;Riedenburg/Altmühltal, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Riedenburger Brauhaus;Das Bier bietet einen cremigen Antrunk, in dem hellmalzige Noten karamellige Züge besitzen, die hier vorhandene Grundsüße bleibt vorhanden. Mit der Zeit wird das Bier hefiger, was besser zu der Süße passt, die Karamelligen Malznoten verharren an zweiter Stelle. Der Doppelbock wirkt so sehr süffig und bietet dennoch ansprechende Aromen, was aber erst im Nachgeschmack deutlich wird, denn hier bleiben die Aromen nicht nur lange vorhanden, sie entledigen sich auch weitestgehend von der Süße, die, wie man jetzt merkt, geringere würzige Nuancen verdeckt hat. So ist hier erstmal eine milde Herbe erkennbar, außerdem geringe Getreidetöne. Daher alles in allem ein ordentlicher, in Teilen aber zu süßer Bock. 8/9/9/10/11/10

Fox River Dunkel;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Fox River Brewing Company;"My bottle indicates ""Special Dark"", but by reading the other reviews I would say this fits. Deep dark brown color with a small covering of tiny tan bubbles. Mild mocha aromas, with roasted barley, mild coffee and dark chocolate. Light lightly silky feel that seems to thin out. Some light blackberry flavors in the background, with the main characters of mild roasted barley and lightly acidic coffee. Clean finish. Almost to clean as you start ot wonder where it went. Very drinkable."
Fox River Dunkel;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Fox River Brewing Company;I’m honored to be the 2nd rater to drink this beer behind the infamous Slikwily. By the way, this beer is courtesy Slikwily and his assortment of great brews from Minnesota/Wisconsin region. Roasty, Chocolately, coffee, Grapefruity. Very interesting first taste combination. Very intriquing indeed. Dark obsidian color and very very citrusy. Not exactly what I was expecting from a Dunkel. Very interesting beer!!! There is also a very acidic attachment to this beer as I’m drinking it. Not exactly what a dunkel should taste like. The last time I tasted anything like this was at belgianfest and it was a flemish sour. Unusual taste for this category. Thanks Slikwily for the beer!!! I'm sure it was a bad bottle and at some point to review this beer again based upon the rating of Slikwily.
Fox River Dunkel;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Fox River Brewing Company;Good dark brown color,small white head that faded quickly leaving little behind.Roasty aroma with a light caramel and light hops presence,maybe also a mild coffee coming through.Nice carbonation to this one,with a decent roasty flavor,mild coffee and mild caramel presence.The hops are there but a bit subduedThere is also a very slight alcohol hint that comes through but nothing that is real noticeable.All in all it's a pretty decent brew and well worth trying again which i will be able to do,since Joeybgood sent me a few of these for later.

Asahi Premium Draft Beer Jukusen;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Asahi Breweries;Yep. It’s a beer. Yellow and fizzy and if drunk gulpingly keeps a head until finish. Take a break and it’s gone. A forgettable beer I suppose but nonetheless a beer. This would also work well as a thirst quencher on a summer day. Not bad at all, but there are a lot of beers that intrigue me more. It’s smoother than a silver super dry.

Asahi Premium Draft Beer Jukusen;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Asahi Breweries;grass, earthy, golden, hazy, white foam, lightly bitter, medium body, lively, bitter. Slightly more bitter, slightly heavier Asahi Super Dry. Paired with a fine sashimi dinner, near perfect fit. On it’s own, a tad boring with unearned bitterness. Seems to be aimed squarely at seafood restaurants.
Asahi Premium Draft Beer Jukusen;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Asahi Breweries;2015.03.08 (bottle): This one is Super Dry with slightly more attention paid to the ingredients. I wish it would do a bit more, be less boring. 2015.12.13 (can): Thick with malt, this is top tier lager from the big guys. Not great aroma or palate, and the aftertaste could use some work.
Asahi Premium Draft Beer Jukusen;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Asahi Breweries;On tap in a bar in Tokyo. Reckon I’d struggle to tell this apart from any other unmemorable glass of tasteless Asahi. The best I can really say is that it isn’t unpleasant.
Asahi Premium Draft Beer Jukusen;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Asahi Breweries;"Draught. Bright gold, thick creamy head. Aromas of grass, thin spice, paper. No character whatsoever- perhaps created to rival Heartland in the ""non-intrusive beer to pair with quality food"" category. But gassier than Heartland, and not as flavorful. Looks classy, but as with many things in Japanese society, appearances can be deceptive."
Asahi Premium Draft Beer Jukusen;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Asahi Breweries;Appearance: Yellow, clear. Little head. Aroma: Some light fruit, hops and malt. Taste: Nice, refreshing hops and malt. Nothing special, really. Info: 500ml bottle, 9/6-2013

Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Good for what they are meant to be which is rocket fast way to get drunk. Don't hold one of these in your hand and stab it with knife in order to shot gun it, it doesn't end well.
Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This “Cold Shot” poured a crystal clear, light yellow colour with a rocky, bright white head. Minimal lacing. Scents include corn, light malt, a little white wine and perm solution. First swig was watery as hell but a little better than expected. I figured it would be a throat grabber. Flavours of corn and cereal most prominent. Finish is also corn and a little malt. Muck.
Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours an insane amount of foamy bubbly white head and has a straw coloured appearance. Thick dirty lacing. Aromas of corn and grains. Flavours are bland malty notes, grainy and more corn. A little bit of sweetness. Dry finish. A little more better flavour than a normal abv Canadian but a one and done beer for me.

Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Drank from a tiny can. Tastes like a molson, but with more malt aroma and taste. I actually like this than the regular Molson Canadian!
Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Just a stronger version of a beer that has no right to the name it claims I thought this would be a fad but it seems to be sticking around
Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);It has a light golden color with good clarity and carbonation. This is topped off with a tall white head of foam that quickly settles down to a wispy thin film layer which make some slick spotty lacing on the glass. Smell: As I had expected it has a light aroma with a pale biscuity malt and very faint grassy hops. Taste/Palate: The base is a pale malt with a plain biscuity and saltine cracker like character. It has a dry overall taste with very light hop flavor and bitterness. The palate has a smooth almost creamy texture with soft carbonation.
Molson Canadian 6.0 Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"The only time I drank this was back when they had the bullseye on the can to encourage you ""shotgun"" the cold shot (before they had to take it off because some c**t with a long face complained it encouraged excessive consumption). It was 08:00 hours. At an employee golf tournament. An 8am shotgun start of course meant an 8am shotgun beer start for my buddy and I. The day went sharply downhill from there as we shotgunned one per hole on a 9 hole course with free shot/sampling stations between each one. The day ended by him spilling beer on my crotch while driving the golf cart then me pouring mine on his because I thought he did it on purpose. All in all it was a pretty great day except that this beer tasted like the bathroom at a Mexican bar smells like."

Pater Van Damme;Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;Bottle from Damme courtesy of Loz, with mug, cheers Loz. Consumed at home Monday 2nd January 2017. Difficult to determine the colour as I have poured it into the stoneware mug that they also sell at the store in Damme, but it looks dark brown. Nutty, with lots of molasses, a little banana toffee and a touch of spice, uncomplicated, decent Belgian ale. A7 A3 T7 P3 Ov14 3.4
Pater Van Damme;Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;"Beer sold for many years by the Tyl & Nele shop in Damme. Dark chestnut colour with ruby hue, creamy, delicate, off-white head; pleasant aroma of banana, plums, pear, chocolate, caramel, candi syrup, brambleberry, floral hops. Candied fruits in the mouth, soft bready, caramelly and chocolatey maltiness, subtle carbonation, bit yeasty, very light sourish touch, liquorice, bitterish grassy and herbal hops in the finish. Very well balanced and tasty. I remember the mystery surrounding the origins of this beer; originally, it was claimed to be made at the premises but no one had ever seen the actual brewery. I personally think it has been brewed at more than one brewery throughout the years - in fact, I have a strong belief the sample I tasted (some ten years ago) was actually made by Sint-Canarus, as well as Pater Van Damme Blond, which was also available at the shop. In fact, I tasted it side by side with Potteloereke and could not find any difference whatsoever, which convinces me that both were the same beer. Later allegedly made at Huyghe but I’m not sure if it still exists today."
Pater Van Damme;Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;From Tijl en Nele in Damme. Served in a ceramic pot, a good creamy head over a dark beer. Spiced, caramel, delicious and smooth. Light spiced aroma. Good stuff.
Pater Van Damme;Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;bottle @ dams bierfestival, dark brown colour with foamy white head. Smell: some caramel, dark fruit notes. Taste: just great hidden the relative high alcohol percent, caramel, plums, sometimes some strange malts, coffee. Nice one, better then expected for a ’huyghe’ beer!
Pater Van Damme;Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;Bottle Deep brown, clear body. Creamy-rocky, off-white, lightly brown head. Aroma of malts: caramel and hints of stronger ones, alcohol, yeast, ... Lightly bitter, lightly sweet. Weak mouthfeel, watery and also dry finish.
Pater Van Damme;Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;Medium brown, hazy with some settled yeast. Not sure how old this bottle was. Very good thoough. Smooth and sweetly malted, with tones of spice, licorice, and fruits. Just a light twinge of sour to round it off. I wish I could find this in the US.
Pater Van Damme;Melle, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Huyghe;"(Quite aged 75cl sample) Dark red brown, yeast in suspension; no more head. Nutty, spicy, rich old portwine nose, vinous as in cold brännvin glögg. Light-spicey, very vinous beer. An old Flemish brown (which is at odds with the young beer, which is all dark malts, spicey, even a tad harsh but nowhere sourish). Lots of esters in this beer. Palate is VERY much portwine-like. Light to medium bodied, bit watery texture, no doubt due to ageing. Faint oily mouthfeel. The beer has benefitted enormously from lagering more than half a decade in my cellar. Turned out a beautiful Flemish ""red"". The spices are unidentifyable. ""Pater van Damme"" has been with us for the longest time now - it still exists! - and it is still shrouded in mystery. Alledgedly, the brewery is on the first floor of the (only) shop were one can buy it. Nobody has ever seen this brewery, though many have asked so. When young, the beer oozes a rather severe, good homebrew, with lots of spices. One of the more plausible tales is that the beer is bought in, in (small) bulk, and further blended with a homemade spiced liqueurdrink. But, as long as nobody really knows the truth, and the beer remains available, I have to classify it here, under its own ""brewery""name. I was quite surprised it wasn’t yet in the database. After many years of mystifying, the people in Damme have finally admitted their beer is brewed in Melle."
Shugborough Red Cap;Shugborough, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shugborough (Titanic);First tasted this at the Fox & Hounds, Houston in September 1997. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear orange amber in colour with a thin white head. Slight note of toffee in the short but sweet aroma. Thin but creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Mixed malts give a digestive biscuit base with sweet raisin fruit and soft caramel. Slight flavour of spicy hop resins noted in the brief bitter aftertaste but this fades fast. Finish is malty with sweet creamy vanilla fudge note right at the end. A decent session bitter.

Bittings Chocolate Cherry Stout;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Stout;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;This was a good beer. I had it out of the tap and it poured black/dark red with a somewhat small tan head. The smell was of chocolate and cherries. The taste added coffee to the equation. Normally I don’t like fruity types of beers as they tend to be too sweet but the cherry flavor in this beer was in the form of a nice aftertone. The palate was nice and creamy. Good job August!
Bittings Chocolate Cherry Stout;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Stout;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;I could see why people would love this beer, I just personally wasn’t into it. Too much flavor complexities for me, I just couldnt sit and drink it. Bursting with cherry.

Medium bodied, and smooth overall.
Bittings Chocolate Cherry Stout;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Stout;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Lasting, solid beige foam of 3cm tops the opaque black pour. Aiming straight for the dessert-loving crowd as an accompaniement for a sweet tooth. Cherry bathing in maraschino bursts from the glass and does not feel superficial. Rather slight, minimalist roastiness nevertheless offers a diplomatic bitterness. A bit fading in mouth, powdery palate, soft carbonation. Not juicy, nor vinous. Alcohol is not perceived at all. While I enjoyed the aroma, I was a bit let down afterwards.
Bittings Chocolate Cherry Stout;Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States;Stout;J.J. Bitting Brewing Co.;Pint @ brewpub poured black with a light brown head. Aroma is strong - big on lite roasted aroma - what I mean it is full of roast but not heavy roast - faint smoke in the roast, light fruity sour (a la soda pop cherry) and cocoa chocolate. A light bodied stout with a slight seltzer feel. Taste has little fruit flavor, is light on the lite roast. Meshes well together for a very quaffable stout, leaves a lightly sweet aftertaste. Low bitterness.

Kuhnhenn Stout;Warren, Michigan, United States;Stout;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"On tap at the pub. The menu called it ""Sweet Stout"" but the tap handle said ""Stout.""

A very drinkable stout, you could gulp this stuff, this stout did not come across as a strong and bold black stout and does not have a lot of the dark roasted malt flavor found in many stouts but this may be a good stout to introduce to a newby or a friend to the dark side of beers.

Up front you get a sweet toffee-biscuit decenment then the body goes weak and washes away to a clean finish where the hops show up to add light bittering. A very thirst busting light summer ale, a tad thin in body but the biscuity malts carry the palate over that detraction.....a well made light summer ale that you can down by the pint.
Scotch Irish Dogsbody;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;Good beer, a little weird the names from this brewery, but very bitter, somewhat yellow good aroma, and good foam too. A little heavy to drink after a while, but good aftertaste too.
Scotch Irish Dogsbody;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;tap @ volo. Lightish gold, thin head. Nose is dusty malt, butterscotch. Flavor is english hops, lightly toasted maltg, maybe some honey.
Scotch Irish Dogsbody;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;Mild citrus and leafy hops with underlying caramel malts. Clear, deep golden coloured body with low, white, fully-diminishing head. Grainy malts and herbal, grassy, earthy hops with fair finishing bitterness. Somewhat simple - there’s not much to grab you. Medium-light body with moderately prickly carbonation. Somewhat watery in texture. Draft with muzzlehatch, Olivier_MTL and Rastacouere at the Winking Judge in Hamilton.
Scotch Irish Dogsbody;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;Couleur blonde, absence de mousse et de dégagement gazeux lors du service à partir du fût. D’influences anglaises, timide grain et houblon apportant un aspect cireux aux arômes également composé d’une trace notable de DMS. Bonne dose de houblon en bouche mais simplement aucune autre matière pour venir le balancer, apparaissant ainsi vers un jus de houblon plus que d’une bière. Échantillon d’une fraîcheur questionnable, Winking Judge, Hamilton, Ontario.
Scotch Irish Dogsbody;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;Oh boy! I do like the scotch irish line, but after having this one on tap at cafe volo, I have to wonder. It’s just non consequential. Great brown colour and a finished frothy head leaves no room for taste. Malt? It’s smooth and utterly Disappointing.
Scotch Irish Dogsbody;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;Clear golden, light gentle white head. Pleasant, but faint english grainy nose. Light bodied, heavy carbonation, straightforward. Heavily hopped blonde ale, pretty much what you’d expect, floral and direct.
Scotch Irish Dogsbody;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;Sampled on draught at the Winking Judge in Hamilton, ON, with tiggmtl, Olivier_MTL and Rastacouere. Light gold with a touch of lasting head...malty, boring nose offers faint hints of dry herbs if you really try, and some caramel...flat, bland flavor profile, touch smoky and woody, dry rather flat and bitter finish. No thanks, I’ll have some water.
Scotch Irish Dogsbody;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;Cask. Clear pale gold with a short vreamy suds head. Light pine and grain aroma. Lemon acidity, biscuit malts are dull. Not without its charms. Originally I would have guessed this not to be well suited to cask. From the looks, smells, and tastes of things It has benefitted at least a couple of points. Finish is a little gritty.
Church-Key Gates of Hell;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Church-Key Brewing;What balls! A beer flavoured with white pepper? A real eye-opener, full of contrasting flavours and aromas. Not subtle. Only drawback is that I probably could only drink one pint of this per evening, it’s that intense.
Church-Key Gates of Hell;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Church-Key Brewing;On tap at the winking judge in Hamilton, Ontario. WOW! This stuff incredible. Darl orange body with tons of visible pepper floaties throughout. Aroma is of fruit (oranges) with black pepper up front. Taste is very sharp, peppery, and at the same time, sweet and fruity. Creamy, smooth, and easy to drink, despite the pepper. Well done Church Key, this beer is amazing.
Church-Key Gates of Hell;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Church-Key Brewing;As others have noted, an experience for sure. Pepper right from the start and all the way to end. In between you're left with what used to be Northumberland ale. I was impressed with the effort, and it was the most talked about beer there, but not for me.
Church-Key Gates of Hell;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Church-Key Brewing;A tough one to call, since I am very impressed with this effort from Church Key, if only because it is a beer that definitely has some balls, and while I thought it was very cool I didn't particularly like it. (It is worth noting that many of the non-Ratebeerians present for the tasting at the Judge loved it and went back for more.)Obviously unfiltered murky brown body with a respectable white head. Intense white pepper in the aroma clears the sinuses nicely. Flavour is dominated by pepper has welll as it burns a firey path across the tongue and leaves a trail of warming down the throat reminiscent of hard liquor belying the relatively low alcohol content in the beer. Didn't make me want another. An experience.
Church-Key Gates of Hell;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Church-Key Brewing;Muddy amber-brown. Frothy off-white head. Peppery aroma w/ sweet malt & smokey notes. Medium, almost gritty feel. Very sweet and somewhat caramel at first, giving way strong white pepper. Finish is very peppery hot. Might work as a marinade, but it doesn't work as a beer.
Church-Key Gates of Hell;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Church-Key Brewing;Murky dark tan. Peppery aroma, slightly smokey with lots of malty sweetness. Very peppery palate. Some balancing maltiness of the chewy, earthy, caramelly variety. Hottish finish. Not balanced enough though - it's like drinking Montreal steak spice.
San Marcos Winter/Dark Wheat;San Marcos, California, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;San Marcos Brewery & Grill;Tap at San Marcos BrewingAmber, nice head and light lacing. Nose of light crisp hops and odd funky wheat notes. The flavor is good, different. Hops and dry tart wheat, light a hoppy german beer. Finishes clean.
San Marcos Winter/Dark Wheat;San Marcos, California, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;San Marcos Brewery & Grill;Nice clear deep amber body topped by a thick head with a good amount of lacing. Nice aroma! I'm surprised. It's sweet and full of banana notes with an underlying yeastiness and little bitterness. The flavor is slightly sweet yet slightly bitter with yeasty notes, a little banana and sour notes. Not nearly as good as the aroma. Medium bodied and smooth.
Grosswald Festtrunk;Heusweiler-Eiweiler, Saarland, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Grosswald Brauerei Bauer;Aus der Flasche (bbe 27-06-2018) im 2018-06 getrunken. Dieses dunkelbraun/rote Bier ist so was von ein typisches Deutsches Dunkel - keine Schnörkel, etwas Malz, etwas mehr Hopfen. Ich finde durchaus trinkbar aber es ist wirklich nichts besonderes und das Hopfen/Malz Verhältnis ist für mich verkehrt herum. Etwas mehr Malzaroma würden dem Bier gut tun. Nach hinten und mit etwas mehr Wärme kommt eine Getreide- und eine leichte Honignote jedoch ohne Süsse auf. Danke an Erzengel für dieses Bier.

Der Nachgeschmack ist lang anhaltend, schön trocken-malzig, ganz leicht süß und angenehm herb. Die Herbe passt schön zum malzig-trockenen Grundton. -> Leckeres, schön trockenes Dunkel, das zwar in die Bockbierzeit passt, aber sich auch bestimmt gut als Bockbier gemacht hätte.

Grosswald Heller Bock;Heusweiler-Eiweiler, Saarland, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Grosswald Brauerei Bauer;(Bottle 33 cl) Slightly hazy, golden beer - almost honeyish - with a very small head. When cold you only detect a weak, spicy, perfumy aroma, but as it warms this beer really reveals it’s extreme complexity. You’re pretty much carpetbombed with refined aromas of fruit, honey and flowery hops. A great brew indeed. 210301
Grosswald Heller Bock;Heusweiler-Eiweiler, Saarland, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Grosswald Brauerei Bauer;A nice beer, very easy drinking, but strong enough to make me savor it, good flavor, will have again.

I under-rated it before, nice to go back and see what a great beer this is!

Chant Du Loup Viking Wolf;Canteleu-Rouen, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Chant Du Loup;Bottled. There beer as actually a chestnut colour but you would know that for a few days, as the things is absolutely loaded with CO2. Upon opening the beer preceded to gush for a day. The head lasted two! Astringent flavours pushed me back in my attempt to sample this one objectively and thoroughly. My warmest thanks though go to SilkT and Chrissie for bring this home from France for me. Cheers guys.
Chant Du Loup Viking Wolf;Canteleu-Rouen, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Chant Du Loup;"I had this straight from the lagering tank at the brewery and it transformed my ideas about lager. The beer came out with a huge white head - or at least it looked like a head. I had waited for a while for the head to subside, but it hadn't, and Patrick, the brewer, was obviously waiting for me to try it and tell him what I thought. I intended to drink through the head, but when I put my lips to the glass and tipped it back I soon realised that the huge creamy white head was in fact the beer itself. And Wow! It was soft and delicious, full of honey and toffee flavours. I asked about the malt used, and after a struggle with his English Patrick told me he used caramel malt. The beer was certainly full, well rounded and tasted of creamy toffee and vanilla ice-cream. It was, in a word, superb. I bought a couple of bottles, and I've just opened one. Hmmm. This has an insistent carbonation that I find unpleasant. It's a natural carbonation because Patrick insisted that he does nothing to the beers, simply filling the bottles straight from the lagering tank. It also has an unpleasantly light body - compared to the full creamy body of the stuff straight from the tank. There is also an acidity and sourness here that doesn't taste off, but is simply not enjoyable. Somewhere in this bottle is the beer I drank at the brewery - but I'm damned if I can find it! Score for direct from the tank: 4.5; score from the bottle: 2.9. Perhaps lager, like cask ale, should always be served damned fresh!"

1516 Eegit's Oatmeal Stout;Vienna, Austria;Stout - Milk / Sweet;1516 Brewing Company;Tap @ brewpub, 02/04/14. Pours a very dark wooden brown with a large, thick, beige head. Aroma is roasty, lightly burnt, some fruitiness and smokiness. Taste is a lot of coffee, some roast, some oat, light salty liquorice. Light and smooth, not much carbonation. A bit too light and too much coffee.
1516 Eegit's Oatmeal Stout;Vienna, Austria;Stout - Milk / Sweet;1516 Brewing Company;Solid black that light doesn’t penetrate with a medium, lasting, creamy, tan, lacy soft head. Looks like an espresso. Deep smell of sweet chocolate like a nice sweet or dry stout. Coffee and some flower hops with a nice soft roast. Medium to full oily body. Creamy and smooth. No carbonation. Initial taste of sweet chocolate with some coffee roast and finishes with a stronger roast bitter finish. Lingering coco and roast. Nice dark malt gives it some Mild elements. Very sweet and rich. Though it’s very nice, it lack a bit more complexity.

Aroma of coffee, dark chocolate, roast and also subtle citric hop notes from the background. Tastes of coffee, cocoa beans, chocolate, some dark fruits and also little citric notes. Mothfeel is full, creamy and it finishes smooth, with coffee and chocolate notes. Overall a quaffable Stout that has the typical dark malt notes, but is surprisingly fresh at the same time, because of some subtle citric aromas. But the biggest highlight is this delicious, extremely creamy foam!

1516 Ossi Black Lager;Vienna, Austria;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;1516 Brewing Company;"Another go at the ""Prague Dunkles"" style that Vienna seems to have made it's own. A black brew with lots of roasted grain and some caramel - true to style this far, but they've gone and put in far too many hops for my liking or the style. These perfumey hops take over the flavour and continue into the bitter, roasty finish. A good beer, but not really true to style. (Draught at 1516, Vienna)"

Chant Du Loup Guédelon;Canteleu-Rouen, France;Traditional Ale - Other;Chant Du Loup;Bottle. This is labelled a Cervoise, but it’s more like the lager ales that some British breweries are playing around with: a top fermented beer with lager ingredients which is then lagered for several weeks. There is some possibility of honey in the flavour, and a faint suggestion of corriander, but mostly it’s fruity with a gentle acidity. Not great.
Thomas Creek Stillwater Vanilla Cream Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Cream Ale;Thomas Creek Brewery;Cream ales have become the new style of the summer for me. I had Genese and maybe a couple others before last year, but I appreciate a quality ice cold cream ale during the hot weather.

Hachenburger Schwarze;Hachenburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Westerwald-Brauerei H. Schneider;Pours a clean hazelnut color, with a huge froth head, revealing a ton of bubbles. Smells of toasty malts with a flowery quality to them, coated by toffee. Has a lower carbonation, resulting in a thin, yet refreshing mouthfeel, with an effervescent finish to it. Tastes of toffee coated leaves anong toast, which leans more on the malts than on the hops. During the finish though, a dry hop bitterness unfolds, featuring again a noble herbal quality, with the malts producing more toffee, tied together by a lactic peak. Finishes clean and refreshing, with a mix of minerals and slowly fading hops remaining on the tongue. Don’t recognize this as a Pils, as it gets advertised on the neck of the bottle, while it certainly convinces as a light bodied, heavier hopped Dunkel. The malts define the taste from the beginning, with hops becoming apparent during the finish, adding a synergetic dryness to the toasty malts.

Hachenburger Zwickel;Hachenburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Westerwald-Brauerei H. Schneider;Pours an amber, hazed color, with a big, bubbly head. Smells of coppery, sweet toffee, peas hull, wet grass and straw. Has a soft, velvet mouthfeel, with a medium, refreshing carbonation to it, convincing for its dry, leafy finish. Tastes of rustic, doughy malts, a rich, leafy hoppiness and a note of toffee on the back end. Old honey blends into dried leaves, turns almost alcoholic while finishing with a pleasantly calm, soft hop appearance and hazelnut shell among earth. Unexpectedly heavy on the tongue for what it represents, while exhibiting a nice hop profile among sweeter malts.

Hachenburger Zwickel;Hachenburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Westerwald-Brauerei H. Schneider;33cl fliptop bb03/2015, merci idiosynkrasie voor de serie. Nice label design overall by this regional brewery. The first less succesful, while in its off-the-markness still interesting beer by Hachenburger so far: beigish pour with heavy carbonation. Chalky yeast aroma, some hard to locate minerals. Taste splits up in quality sweet malts with marzipan dryness and a distinct grassy hop bitterness. Yeast profile remains too timid and body overall too fizzy for it all to come together. Grainy husk-bitter finish, late hop pollen. Some character in the base ingredient department, but rare remain the truly spectacular yeast-driven supra-Main Zwickls...

Hachenburger Zwickel;Hachenburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Westerwald-Brauerei H. Schneider;Schönes neues Etiketten-Design mit springendem Wildschwein – gefällt mir besser als die alte Variante. Das Bier im Glas ist orange-trüb und riecht süßlich-würzig. Der Antrunk ist herb-neutral, leichte milde Hefetöne spürbar. Zum Hauptteil wird das Bier etwas würziger, die milde und etwas laff anmutende Note hält sich aber recht lange auf der Zunge. Der Nachgeschmack ist mild-herb, angenehm weich und leicht würzig. Angenehm abgestimmt herb-hefig. --> Interessantes Bier, das ich viel herber in Erinnerung hatte. Insgesamt aber etwas zu laff-neutral. (Test vom 23.9.2009) --> 12,10,11,9,12,10 - 10,30

I notice a mahogany body, a body like no other... no other that sits in front of me. This beer... a beer. Mind and body over a 6000 year old recipe. What do I conjure? This slight whisky and strong caramel malt doesn’t qualify after the long duration of transposing. My mahogany depression continues...

Molson Dry Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Y’a de ces moments où je me sent plutôt poisson et/ou maladroitement curieux. L’achat de cette en canette en est un parfait exemple. Je l’sais, on l’sais tous que ça sera un grosse farce, mais, je l’ai quand même achetée. Ce n’est pas laid, au contraire, mais ça sent pas bon. Ça sent l’épis de maïs bouilli et refroidi, la sauce poisson et les herbes mouillées. L’absence de saveurs est interrompue par du foin mouillé et du sucre raffiné. Je n’ai qu’une chanson de Hank Williams en tête (Cold Cold Heart), et je me sens honteux d’avoir fait un lien avec lui…(1714-150116)
Molson Dry Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Arômes de malt sucré plutôt insidipe. Goût de malt, sucre, malt et sucre. Amertume absente. Comme son nom le dit, à boire d’une shot pout avoir un semblant d’appréciation.
Molson Dry Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A 6.5% ABV. version of the Molson Dry, put in a 8-pack of small cans. Pours a light golden colour with a big frothy white head that stays a decent time and gives out a bit of foamy lacing. The nose is not overly sweet as I thought it would be, kind of malty. Notes of alcohol and bananas. Taste of sweet malt with the famous Molson corn in the finish. A little adjuncts, but overall, not too bad. Nothing too chemical. Made for the 18-20 year olds.
Molson Dry Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bouteille 250ml. Couleur jaune pâle avec une mousse blanche assez dense. Goût semblable à sa cousine la Molson Dry. Goût d’alcool un peu plus prononcé. Sans grand intérêt.
Molson Dry Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);250ml can, 6.5% a/v Gift from brother. Pours very generic gold with white head, looks exactly like Molson Dry which is no surprise. Aroma is mostly malt with some corn, very little hops. Taste is quite malty as well, but actually balanced well enough with hops as to remain unoffensive. The palate is dry as promised, still just a coldshot as advertised, but prefer this one to the Canadian cold shots. God love the french.
Molson Dry Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);So... let me get this straight. It’s the same Molson Dry 6.5 beer but in a smaller can? Or different beer in a smaller can, with the same name? Pours with big thick foamy head and an average gold colour - though one should wonder what the head is for since the whole thing implies you’ll drink it out of a can. Aroma of stale bread with a hint of lemon juice. Flavour is slight grain hints - but ultimately it has almost no flavour. The real kicker is in the aftertaste, which is slightly dry - but then sinks into all of this corn and rice adjunct stuff that coats your tongue. You’d better drink another to try and forget about it.
Molson Dry Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This one is made that way for a pretty good reason. It can be drank in two seconds. Which basically means that you just... don’t really have to taste it. Even more awful than the regular Molson Dry (is it only because of the can?).
Molson Dry Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Cannette. De couleur dorée et transparente. Nez de maïs sucré, de grains de malt pâle avec des notes herbeuses gazonnées et métalliques. Goût de grains de malt pâle âcre avec un léger goût chimique (faibles notes végétales) lors de l’entrée en bouche suivi d’un goût moyennement sucré de maïs ainsi qu’une finale légèrement herbeuse (gazonnée) avec des notes d’alcool métallique. Post-goût court et aux notes sèches avec un goût légèrement métallique et des notes herbeuses.
Molson Dry Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);As bad as the Molson Canadian cold shots in every way! Bad! Bad! Bad! (...there, did I use up my 75 character minimum?)
Molson Dry Cold Shots;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Thankfully Small Can: 0.5 #2. My brother-in-law had the foresight to give this to me for a rating when it came attached to a six of Canadian he’d bought. What a pitiful thing it was. I’m only thankful I found a nice girl to split it with or I’d have been stuck drinking it alone. Smells like Han Solo after a night in the carcass during Empire; looks like carbonated urine; tastes like carbonated urine sitting in an animal carcass. I drank it fast because there was no f’n way I was letting it get warm. PASS."
Southern Tier Hop Sun;Lakewood, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);This is another Souther Tier that I sampled a while back and forgot to review. I remember getting it as a seasonal, so must have been last summer or spring. It was a decent smooth wheat with a little hop kick at the end. Was good enough to want to sample again and grab a 6-pack. Sill some around from the summer, so may grab one to update this rating, along with their Harvest Ale which is decent too. UPDATED 10/27/11- Good as remembered. One of the better summer seasonals. Enough summer/fall beers for now, but will probably look out for this next year.
Southern Tier Hop Sun;Lakewood, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);"From Jun 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with jwc215. Thanks Joe! This pours a clear gold with a 2 finger head of foam and some lacing. Great head retention. The smell is very nice. A good presence of lemony citrus hops and about an equal amount of malt hits my nosebuds. If the taste is anything like the smell, this could be good... The taste follows the nose alright. A very tasty lemon hoppy flavour balanced by an ample malty sweetness and some wheat notes. Man, I could drink a lot of this one. It's so tasty and so smooth. Very good mouthfeel here and the carbonation is actually on the light side and that works perfectly. The finish has a nice lemon bitter subtleness to it. I like! A great drinking experience and a real authentic session brew. I'm so pleased I got to try this; I don't think I've had a better example of style. Southern Tier has done it again!"

Southern Tier Hop Sun;Lakewood, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);A light unobtrusive summery wheat ale that strikes a balance between grainy cereal flavors and mild citrus.

Bear Creek BUD Nut Brown;Redmond, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Bottle pours dark ruby, large milk frothish like head (off-white), and fantastic lacing.   Lacing almost appears like pancake batter, its that thick.   Roasted malts on the nose, extremely light hop tones as well.   Continued roasted maltiness on the tongue, but the mouthfeel was a bit thin.   An abrupt sweet & sour characteristic emerges halfway through.   By the finish, and as the beer warms, the sweet & sour effect diminishes.   Slight hop bitterness on the finish.   Overall, looks great, smells decent, but the flavor is a bit off.   Not bad, but just not quite there.

Gilded Otter Mayday Maibock;New Paltz, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Hazy orange amber hue with little head. Aroma is hard to discern.

Hard to get a good read on the nose since it was pollen time in New Paltz this weekend. good carbonation with up fron hoppiness that transitions to a well rounded, smooth body for the last half of the mouthfeel. So nice I rewarded myself with two. Went well with the grilled chicken sandwich. Re-rate..05/09..... Semi-hazy amber with a light film from lackluster carbonation. A light malt nose leads into the Medium minus body that boarders upon watery. A bit of fruitiness. strong backbone of graininess. a quick finish...not the maibock I recall last year.

Super effervescent with many fine bubbles and floaties. Yeasty, slightly sour nose. Harshly zingy in the mouth. Fruity and bitter with a short tinny finish. A little banana evident right at the end. Not quite sure where this fits in the Coopers’ portfolio. Suburban/country football ground beer? Something to drink while you are doing something else. Perfectly drinkable though.

Light to medium in body, medium carbonation and fine length in the finish. Has fair hop bite but seemed to me more like a premium lager in terms of character rather than a golden ale.

Middle Ages Raspberry Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;On tap @ Little Pub on Hamilton College campus. Light yellow pour, very fizzy head. Aroma holds light berry, cereal grain, wheat, and sweet malt. Flavor is much the same, with an uninteresting but present fruit profile. Palate is light and crisp. Mediocre.
Middle Ages Raspberry Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;on tap at Faegan’s. A light yellow pour with minimal head. The aroma is weak raspberry but still smells good. The taste is decently fruity but I have definitely had better fruit beers. Drinkable but not all that remarkable
Middle Ages Raspberry Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;At the brewery. Not up to Middle Ages long-term track record of very representative styles, I guess this is aimed at the popular crowd. It’s a light-bodied lager with the addition of something raspberry. However it is quite acidic and I would not think that is something the fruit crowd will consider drinkable. Above average gas. This impressed me as an accident at the taps of some second-rate bar, not something to be served up at the brewery itself.
Middle Ages Raspberry Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;At the brewery. Clear, light goldwith an off-white head and a strong raspberry aroma. The first impression was the fruit, not as strong as the aroma would indicate. The aftertaste was hops. It was light and thirst quenching, a summer beer.

Middle Ages Raspberry Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;Raspberry comes out more on the palate than in the aroma. Light bodied with just enough hops tossed in. Recommended.

Middle Ages Raspberry Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;Sample at brewery. Cloudly light gold in colour. Some sort of light wheaty beer with a bit of raspberry splash thrown in. Very mild on the palate very lacking in the flavour. Will not want this again.
Middle Ages Raspberry Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;This was not as balanced as I had hoped and the raspberry flavor did not mix as well as I would have liked it to. Still in all, this was not a bad beer, just not the best fruit beer I have tried.

Bowland Dragon;Clitheroe, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bowland Brewery;Cask, Aikmans Cellar Bar, St Andrews. Golden with a thin cream head. Nose is hoppy with some sweet toffeeness, not anything really distinct here. Mouth is much the same, some syrupy sweetness with a nice crisp hop balance. Really just not great.

Light tang in the nose, some toasty dough. Tangy flavor, too, with slight fruits and berries, faint toasty leafy bitterness. Light bodied with fine carbonation. Mildly tangy finish with some toasty dough and bits of berries. Not great condition, but the base beer might not be any good, anyway.

Bavaria Light (Netherlands);Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Originally rated October 2009. Bought a six-pack of this one at the LCBO (thank God - on special)... and was not expecting much. Urine smelling malt aromas at first pour. Then, metallic sewage. Then corn. Light golden colour, decent-size white head that is thin and disappears quickly like fizz stuff and does not have any lacing. Thin watery mouthfeel with hardly any taste. Chemical malts maybe, and I actually think Bud Light might be better... ha, ha. Had a few from the can over Monday Night Football and found it gross and unappealing. Now, testing from the glass... even worst. Yukkie poo !

Veltins Alkoholfrei;Meschede-Grevenstein, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauerei C.& A. Veltins;0.5 l bottle from local ’Trink & Spare’, best before November 2017. Clear, golden yellow with a medium large, frothy, almost stable, white head. Slightly sweetish, a bit grassy aroma of grains and some straw. Moderately sweet, rather grassy taste of grains and straw, followed by a short, rather dry-bitter, slightly grassy finish. Medium body, slightly effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Very bland.
SPAR Dudler;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Parkbrauerei;Canned, 0.50l. Clear pale straw color with large frothy white head and lots of lively bubbles. Artificial citric aroma kills all other elements that I would like to catch. Tastes like fizzy lemon juice without beer character. Mouthfeel is plain, body is light, texture is sticky, while carbonation in palate is quite fizzy. It wasn’t even worth of trying it...
SPAR Dudler;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Parkbrauerei;01/08 0.5 l can from Spar in BTC, Ljubljana. Very pale yellow bodied with big head that goes down very fast. Quite ok aroma, some lemon, almond, spices, with some malts as well. But...flavor...ouch! At first slightly sweetish, artificial and watery, but fine. Later turned into something bordering with unpleasant, so artificial skunky spices (read chemicals), that are quite hard to describe in details and I don’t want to bother with it. Finish is luckily short. Really awful, even for radlers!
SPAR Dudler;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Parkbrauerei;Beer no. 12 of my Slovenian beerhunt. Dudler.... what a name. 0.5l can. It poured a huge fluffy white head that went away fast. Pale yellow colour. The nose was fake lemon only. The taste had no discernable trace of beer (and it’s 50% apparently). Just a distinct fake honeyish and lemony sweet taste. And guess what. This contains no lemons (only citric acid) and E950 (Acesulfame-K), E951 (Aspartame), E952 (Cyclamic Acid), E954 (Saccharine) and of course because of Aspartame - Phenylalanine. Healthy stuff indeed. It’s not nasty, it’s pleasant in an odd, fake way, but if you find that you like it.... just look at the ingredients list, will you ?

Full malty, nutty aroma, bit dusty but still sweetish, creamy and nice. Taste-wise this is a lovely nutty dark lager, with chocolate notes, slightly creamy. Full carbonation. Solid lighy roasty aftertaste. Mild bitterness. Flavors do clash at times randomly later on, ends up slightly worse than the initial impression, but quite likable overall.
Radgonsko Temno;Gornja Radgona, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Kostanj;Pours a dark brown color, topped with a big and quite lasting beige colored head. Gentle roasted aroma with some coffee notes that are easily picked up. Taste is ssweet and caramel at first, gentle bitterness in the finish and some coffee. Very light, almost empty body, no dark aftertaste. Drinkable but watery. Too bad.
Radgonsko Temno;Gornja Radgona, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Kostanj;Tap at the Brewpub. Aroma is strongly sour, background roasted malt. Moderate duration of head. Almost black colour. Taste is strongly sour, but IMO much of it comes from incorrect usage of roasted malt. Might even be they are using incorrect malt. Hardly drinkable. Bad, sadly.

West Brothers Shot in the Dark Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout;West Brothers Brewery;Now this is a powerful over the top stout. Quite enjoyable, but I might as well have drank a cup of coffee. A great espresso stout, but literally all the great things about coffee, with cream and sugar. Sweet in the mouthfeel with a great bone dry finish. Yum!
West Brothers Shot in the Dark Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout;West Brothers Brewery;On tap at the BBB in Augusta: A thick darkness with a thin creamy tan head unveils a powerful mocha coffee bean and roasted malt aroma. Body is very smooth and flavorful with nice sweetness throughout and a dry, bitter and lingering coffee finish. An enjoyable brew.
West Brothers Shot in the Dark Stout;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Stout;West Brothers Brewery;This has a great coffee nose on it, which you'd expect from a beer conditioned with espresso beans. The aroma carries over into the flavor, but the coffee isn't backed up enough by the malts, which leaves this coffee stout a little light. Still, it'd make an excellent breakfast beer with that eye-opening coffee aroma and the lightness keeping it from being too heavy for bright-eyed-and-bushy-tailed drinking.
Brown's Imperial Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brown's Brewing Company;Seems like every craft brewery is releasing their own ultra-rare imperial stout these days. A lot of people hate this trend, but I’m okay with it since, more often than not, these beers are really good and a great example of what American craft brewers can do regardless of size. The best example of that is Brown’s Imperial Stout, made in my hometown area of New York’s Capital District. They bottled this for the first time in 2012 and limited it to only 84 total bottles (and they were only $6 each - what a bargain!). While not the best imperial stout I’ve ever had, it’s still quite impressive considering it was only made with a few malts and one hop. I poured a 22oz bottle into an official Brown’s tumbler. Appearance: By far THE darkest beer I’ve ever seen! Liquid is as black as a black hole and it forms a huge, extremely dark brown, almost black foamy head. The lacing and retention on this beer is fantastic. Smell: The usual imperial stout aroma of black licorice, black cherry, plum, and a touch of grain alcohol. Taste: Because Brown’s Imperial Stout pours such a thick, foamy head, that initial taste of that initial swig is quite bitter. It’s a dry bitterness of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Once the liquid passes the tongue it’s a whole new ballgame. Strong sweet notes of black cherry and plum with slight black licorice as it transitions to the finish. The final third of the palate is similar to the opening with the bittersweet flavors of dark chocolate, French roast coffee and just a touch of alcohol. It’s like a rum without the spice or a clear liquor with a touch of cinnamon. That’s not to say this beer is absolutely delicious. There seems to be a noticeable lack of roasted malt and the sweet elements seem a little cloying. That being said, the balance of the palate overall is impressive as the sweet side never becomes sickly sweet and the bitter side never becomes too dry. Drinkability: The bottle indicates the beer is 10.4% ABV, but the brewer’s website says 10.2%. So either way, you can tell Brown’s Imperial Stout is a pretty hefty beer. But unlike most double-digit ABV stouts, there is little to no alcohol presence here. Only the faintest hint of alcohol warmth, which is fine because it blends well with the natural tastes of the beer. The mouthfeel is fairly thick, but extremely soft. One of the most comfortable beers I’ve ever had, actually. The aftertaste is a tad dry and somewhat sticky, but easily tolerable. This would be an ideal pairing with dark, gamey meats or drank alone as a dessert.
Brown's Imperial Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brown's Brewing Company;A - Pours a very dark black color with a nice finger of dark brown head. The head had nice retention and left behind some nice lacing. S - The strongest scent is of the roasted malt, and there is a nice amount of it. There is also some nice chocolate and carmel/toffee elements to go along with it. Could be a bit more powerful overall. T - Starts of with a really deep chocolate malt taste that really builds nicely. Then a bit of toffee sweetness and a bit of dark fruit flavor comes through. Just a hint of bitterness at the finish that lingers, from a mixture of chocolate and hops. M - Full bodied with a very low amount of carbonation. Super creamy and pretty smooth, D - Fairly drinkable. It is a fairly heavy beer, but it is still very enjoyable and goes down very smooth. The flavors are really nice and pretty well balanced, especially the finish.
Brown's Imperial Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brown's Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Dark brown, almost black pour with a nice creamy off white head. Aroma is chocolate and coffee. Medium palate and a bit dry. Not what I would expect in an Imperial Stout. Flavor was chocolate, coffee, molasses and an acidic tartness. A bit out of the ordinary. Not bad, just not exceptional.
Brown's Imperial Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brown's Brewing Company;Bottle shared after the Bruery Reserve Society Initiation. This really must have been an unintentionally sour beer tasting without my knowledge, because this was another one. Looks great on the pour - black in color with a nice heavy tan head. Aroma is roasty with dark fruit, chocolate, and tartness. Flavor is pretty tart and not as intense as I expect from this style, but still not bad. Roasted malt, chocolate, plum/raisin, and some fruity tartness. Medium body with a mildly bitter and acidic palate. Not at all boozy, but a bit weird for sure.
Brown's Imperial Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brown's Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Smell is strong chocolate malts. Appearance is everything you want out of a stout, very dark brown, with a thick, foamy, medium brown head. Taste is watered down chocolate malts and a strong alcohol presence. Overall, one of my least favorite imperial stouts.
Brown's Imperial Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brown's Brewing Company;Thanks to Ethan for sharing. Jet black pour, thin beige head and spotty lace. Chocolate covered cherry aroma. Creamy up front with a dry bitter finish. Kinda chalky

The nose is sweet, lactic, some smoke, some fruit skins, chocolate, tart. Flavor is roasty, dark and grainy, fruit skins, sweet chocolate, acidic, bitter grian. Palate is bitter and acidic.
Brown's Imperial Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brown's Brewing Company;The appearance is jet black and about as easy to see through as a bowling ball. One finger of cocoa-brown head. The aroma is heavy, oily. Milky chocolate, toasted &#40not bitter/burnt&#41 malt aroma. Strong but not brutal or bitter. A hint of licorice. Plums, raisins, dates. The taste is milk chocolate and dark grapes. Some bitter, roasted malts underneath. The bitterness rises up as it warms. The feel is motor oil, thick and smooth. And no bite whatsoever. It is a terrific sipper, but a tough repeater. The flavor is all there. Even better when it’s warmed up.
Brown's Imperial Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brown's Brewing Company;"A ""big"" beer somewhat uncharacteristic of Brown’s style, but great malt and chocolate notes make it a winner. Here’s to hoping they make this a year ’round beer!"
Brown's Imperial Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brown's Brewing Company;Rather nice imperial stout with a good balance between the roasted, bitter and sweet.

Brown's Whiskey Porter;Troy, New York, United States;Porter;Brown's Brewing Company;Was introduced to this by my beer snob brother in law. Porters are usually hit or miss with me, but this one nailed it. You can taste the barrel aging, but it is not overbearing. Leaves a good burn in the tummy, despite the relatively low abv.

Poured a pitch black thinner to average density body under a soap bubble super light beige head.

Flavor of light butter, especially in the middle, up front has some light whiskey and wet burnt malts, dark toast and a bit more butter. Get the butter out and this will be far better.
Brown's Whiskey Porter;Troy, New York, United States;Porter;Brown's Brewing Company;On Tap at the brewery in Troy, NY. Pours dark brown with long lived off-white head and nice lacing.

Flossmoor Station Pale Hose Pale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Much lighter in flavor, mouthfeel, and appearance than their IPA. Good. Quite well-balanced. Nice up front aroma hoppiness with slight dry bitterness at the end. Me likee...Besides, if drinking this beer will help take the Sox to the Series and prevent the Cubs from even making the playoffs, I’m in!
Flossmoor Station Pale Hose Pale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;"Draft. This one might get lost in a place where hoppy IPAs are the standard. Nice, slightly hazy copper body, with a head that coats the sides of the glass. Though lower in IPAs, hops are still a big part of the flavor profile. These lend bitterness and a grapefruit nose, I'm supposing Cascade or Northern Brewer and a bit of Amarillo. Malts are lessened, but there's a light toasty character. Probably not too big on alcohol. Matt's not here today, (apparently at the Big Border Bash, serving up the last of the Train Wreck of Flaver, drat him!) so I couldn't get all the details. But this rating finally makes me the rater who's had the most Flossmoor Station beers!... for now. Just to clear up confusion over the name: ""Pale Hose"" is a nickname for the White Sox. Matt put this on tap at the same time as ""Break the Curse Weizen Bock,"" in reference to the Cubs' inability to win a World Series within living memory."
Sail & Anchor Dockers Wheat Beer;Fremantle, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Sail & Anchor Brewery;On tap at the Sail & Anchor in Freo. Very pale yellow, puffy head, decent lace. Faint itrus aromas, zesty citrus sweet palate but a little watery. Maybe it’s because I tried this after the terrific IPA or maybe it’s because of the midstrength style, but I found this pretty average.
Sail & Anchor Dockers Wheat Beer;Fremantle, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Sail & Anchor Brewery;First of all, with a name like the Dockers Beer you can’t go wrong - the only problem with this brew is that it is midstrength ....... just like the Eagles!!!

Sail & Anchor Dockers Wheat Beer;Fremantle, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Sail & Anchor Brewery;Soft fruity aroma, mainly of lemons. Pale straw colour with a short lasting head that at least left good lacing. Fairly light in the body with a slightly oily texture. Lemon and wheat taste with a little harshness on the finish along with lemon zest. Fairly easy drinking mid strength. This is my 2nd dockers beer from this brewery and all I can say is go the Eagles!!

Iceni Black Lager;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Iceni Brewery;Cask Conditioned (Gravity). White Horse, Hedgerley, Bucks. poured by me. This is rather unique, it's as dark as a stout, but it's a lager. I'm guessing they used roasted/chocolate malts but lager yeast/brewing method. It's not brilliant, but its truely unique (in terms of cask beers) and pretty good.
John Shippeys Gutless Low Carb;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;John Shippeys Brewing Company;No, this is not a joke. Made with 35% honey, and a final gravity of 1.0015. That is not an extra zero either. Light amber colour with a thin white head ( was actually still carbonating when I tried it). Honey aroma. Initial pleasant sweet honey flavour and hints at some body, then vanishes on the finish.
Rebellion Sabotage;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Cask Conditioned, Three Horsehoes, Marlow Bottom (Sole Rebellion pub, 1/4 from brewery). A tasty, fruity bitter.
Rebellion Mayhem;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Cask, at Newark Beer Festival, May 2004. The commercial description just about says it all. Rebellion seems to specialise in these malty and slightly fruity, but fairly dry, best bitters and this is no exception. Solid if unspectacular. Dry bitterness lingers in the aftertaste a little more than the fruit.
Rebellion Mayhem;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Sampled cask conditioned at Akkurat, Stockholm. Copper colour.

Dům Vanilkové;Prague, Czech Republic;Flavored - Other;Pivovarský Dům;Draught at Pivovarsky Dum. Clear amber. Verry vanilla aroma. I would score it a perfect ten because I love vanilla, but the voice in my head says that beer doesnt smell like this... cheaters. The flavor has a lot of vanilla too, but there is a pronounced bitterness that doesnt mesh well with it. I think that vanilla has to be pretty sweet to really taste good, so not a winner for me.

Dům Pšeničné;Prague, Czech Republic;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pivovarský Dům;Taster glass @ Pivovarský Dům, Prague (March 24, 2018). This is a decent Hefeweizen - there is enough bananas even without any artificial additions. Maybe a bit on the light side, as seen by the ABV. Again, one of the 'normal' beers of the place.

Rohrbach Nate (X-Ale);Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Now called Old Nate. Fresh growler courtesy of shadey. Pours copper with a generous tan lingering head. Smells of pine, some citrus, some sweet malt. Tastes perfumy with a mellow bitterness. Some sweet malt and underlying spiciness. Mouthfeel is earthy with a tea like finish. Okay as a casual session brew.
Rohrbach Nate (X-Ale);Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Rohrbach Brewing Company;5 oz draught sample at the brewpub, mid-October 2006. Medium oily amber with a lovely smooth, small head that lasts fully half an hour, thick creamy lacing....diacetyl butteriness alas nearly drowns out orangy-apricot tinged hops.....the tongue discovers a bit of butter as well, mostly in the oily mouthfeel, but faint PNW hops do emerge eventually through the hazyness.....touches of baked apricots and dry wood towards the finish....mmm, this had some potential but infection is it’s downfall.

Rohrbach Nate (X-Ale);Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Rohrbach Brewing Company;(cask conditioned @ The Old Toad - Rochester, NY) Golden color with no a thick and puffy tan head. Aroma begins with a very sweet and caramelly flavor and then you get punched in the nose with hops. Lots and lots of hops, but still that caramel sweetness hangs around. The flavor is packed with hops as well. Bitter and peppery hop flavor at the beginning with a smooth and sweet middle and a bitter, hoppy finish. Very smooth and very hoppy.
Rohrbach Nate (X-Ale);Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Rohrbach Brewing Company;"(Draught) Sampled at the Central New York Brewfest on February 4, 2006. Described by the Rohrbach representative as a ""Hoppy Pale Ale"" - so I asked is it an IPA? ""No, its a Hoppy Pale Ale"". So is it an American Pale Ale? ""No, its a HOPPY Pale Ale."" I obviously gave up... Medium, tan head with a deep orange body. Hi-C hops. Astonishingly bitter with the Cascade and Piney hop merry-go-round. Bitterly fun!"

And they enjoyed several good hop fixes. IBU 44 yet good bitter hop lead. Called an American double IPA yet a bitter according to Jim and I agree. Good citrus hop aroma that will disappear by the time it’s poured through the taps.
Rohrbach Nate (X-Ale);Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Had this at the Flour City Brew Fest. Kind of orange in color. Too many hops for my taste and the bitter ending did me in.

Пенка супер стойкая, плотная. Вкус питкий, карамельные составляющие слабые, по началу также как и раньше много бананов, персика и дрожжей. Послевкусие с мощной и продолжительной кислинкой. Послевкусие немного водянистое, дрожжи кажуться уже немного лишние, а бананы и оттенки фруктового пюре быстро затихли. Но все равно пиво очень топовое, заходит мне этот стиль.

Adirondack Oktoberfest;Lake George, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Adirondack Pub and Brewery;Out of a bottle best by 12-20-15, which I think was optimistic. Amber color with a short lived off white head. Caramel sugar nose with some bad perfume notes. Some burnt caramel and cardboard, ripe fruit and soured lemon peels, and some stale popcorn in the finish. Maybe better fresher.
Adirondack Oktoberfest;Lake George, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Adirondack Pub and Brewery;"Draft at Pony Bar. Pours orange with a white head.

Medium-to-dark amber, slightly reddish tint, little head, very clear. Light malty nose. Quite sweet, sugary, little carbonation, very smooth.

Adirondack Fat Scotsman Ale;Lake George, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Adirondack Pub and Brewery;There aren't enough scotch ales in the world. If you're in Lake George NY, a trip to this brewery is worth it if you order one of these.

Poured a clear amber with a thin beige ring for a head. Light brown sugar, caramel malt nose. Some dark fruit. Flavor is sweet, but not what I expected. Body was also lighter than expected. On their beer menu this was listed as a Scotch ale, so I was expecting more flavor and more body. Not bad, just not what I was hoping for.

Small head poured from 12 oz bottle. Initial taste is burnt sugar and caramel which quickly subsides into a malty whiskey aftertaste that clings to the tongue. The lingering effects of sip after sip leaves a tingle on the tongue similar to scotch whiskey. Very different mouthfeel and very welcomed during colder months. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Pours a dark brown color with hints of red, a small off-white head. The aroma is sweet berries and caramel, alcohol heat hits you. The aroma is very robust almost pushing toward some of the fruity malt driven Belgian Ales or a Barley Wine. The flavor is very nice; sweet nutty and fruity malts, toffee, loads of sweetness here, hefty, a big brew! This is a hell of a Summer seasonal. Very much dominated by sweet sugars and dark fruity malts. Very good. Quite hot."
Adirondack Snow Trout Stout;Lake George, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Adirondack Pub and Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a black color with a nice level finger’s worth of off white foamy head that seemed to take forever to dissipate. Sliding messy lace. The aroma had some soft roasty to sweet cocoa beans, coffee beans, a touch of vanilla and then Irish cream. Dark fruits as it warms up. The flavor leans towards the sweet side covering all of the previously mentioned aromas together. Mild fruity sweet to creamy aftertaste. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. ABV felt fine. Pretty smooth and creamy all around. Overall, pretty nice Irish dry stout well worthy of having again.

Adirondack Snow Trout Stout;Lake George, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Adirondack Pub and Brewery;On Tap at Brewery. Dark black/brown color with only wisps of head. Aroma is plenty of fresh roast. Flavor is a lot milder than I would have thought. Pretty mild roast, almost porterish. I’m not detecting the chocolate. Body is a little thin for a stout, but if you told me this was a porter I would say - great porter. As a stout, its a bit thin.
Adirondack Snow Trout Stout;Lake George, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Adirondack Pub and Brewery;Appearance of dirty water (muddy brownish). Doesn’t look like a stout.

A bit of acidity is also present. Moderately opaque dark brown/black color with no head whatsoever. Where’s the head?? Thin, mildly peat-like water with touches of dark chocolate. Acidic, thin, and lacking. A dissapointment.
Trinity Marzen;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trinity Brewhouse;Good looking clear red with a generous helping of head. Not much of an aroma but a grand caramelly flavour. Buttery and smooth but with a slightly off sicky flavour. Good though.
Trinity Marzen;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trinity Brewhouse;I have to admit, I was a little disappointed in this one. It was described as a Marzen with notes of toffee and spices. I didn’t tatse it. It had a deep caramel color with a one finger, fluffy head. The aroma was a muddled combination of sweet malts and hops. The malts and hops did not balance each other nicely. I think there’s a good beer in there waiting to get out, but this batch missed the mark.
Trinity Marzen;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trinity Brewhouse;Copper in color with a small white lacing around the rim. Sweet malt aroma with mild toasted malt. Sweet malt dominates with faint hop flavor in the backkground.

Trinity Larkens Irish Stout;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Stout;Trinity Brewhouse;On tap at the brewpub. Interesting. This was definitely a Guinness replacement, but I found the body way way way too thick. I’d just had the barrel-aged Barleywine and Imperial Stout, but found this too sweet. There wasn’t a nice dry crisp roast to balance. Also, I was burping some diacetyl after this beer.

The aroma was brown malt bready and dark malt. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of roasted malt breads and herseys cocoa chocolate. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
Paddys Brewers Delight;Flemington, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);I agree Ecze, this is a bock style of beer. Good amber/copper finish in the glass with a good clean white head. The nose is a gentle maltiness with a small amount of hop aroma, good I say for the style. I like the buttery undertones here and the nuttiness of the finish. Once again, this brewery at least makes a bloody good effort. Well done.
Paddys Brewers Delight;Flemington, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Draught, at Paddy’s Brewpub, Flemington, Australia. Amber with a white head. Easy drinking smooth set of malts. On the sweet side of things and for the strength it could have done with some more bitter structure. Another good drop from this little Aussie champion.The gathering: duff, eczematic, motelpogo, Spiesy, Sully and late arrival Linc.
Paddys Brewers Delight;Flemington, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Sweet and sticky malts, some lemony, floral piney hops, failry tasty, but as linc points out a little to sweet.
Paddys Brewers Delight;Flemington, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Sweet floral fruity aroma, a little oily with pine and lemon on the palate, full malts.

Paddys Brewers Delight;Flemington, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);this was my first beer of the spiesy homecoming tasting session. pretty amber looking with a lasting head. aroma of lemon cheesecake and hay. quite full in the mouth, seemingly reasonably alcoholic, finish dominated by german grassy hops with a slight harsh pride of ringwood kick. very drinkable stuff. many thanks to the staff at paddy’s for their hospitality
Paddys Brewers Delight;Flemington, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);"The staff couldn't tell us anything about this beer apart from its name so I'm going on what it tastes like rather than what it might be intended to be, and I've called it a BOCK - tastes like 6-6.5% or so. But it is quite bitter so who knows it might be a ""European strong lager"". So lemme tell you more: it is a nice, clear, deep gold with a hint of red, with a nice creamy head ""serviced from below"" to quote the expat aussie rambo. smells are grass, fresh bread and malt. taste is grainy malt, slightly nutty, finishing with some more bread, a bit of honey, some nice diacetyl (well, i think it's nice) and a surprisingly assertive herbal bitterness. a very decent effort. this brewery is more reliable for classic styles than any other australian micro i can think of."
Slater's Road to Ruin;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Slater's Ales;Cask Conditioned at The White Lion, Fewcott, Oxon. Pale golden beer with lively head. Long dry tangy hoppy beer with an underlying malty sweetness. Excellent condition with a tangy juiciness. Could be a seasonal as this is twice I have had this in spring. Grapefruit and orange notes in the flavour. A very decent beer indeed.

Unimpressive.
Noi Voi Century Beer Pilsener;Lainate, Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlsberg Italia;45c blue-white tin. Funny how the the things you expect to be the very worst sometimes turn out alright. Sweet, fruity malt aroma with a surprisingly heady nostrilful of alcohol. Smells like a potent Belgian ale. Flavour not quite as....engaging, but inoffensively sweet and buttery nonetheless. Even some apple or pear-like fruit. Unexpectedly half-decent canned ’Pilsener’.
Noi Voi Century Beer Pilsener;Lainate, Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlsberg Italia;Bottled. Pale yellow colour, mediumsized white head. Aroma of maize and also very skunky notes. Very unpleasant. Flavour is sweet malty with hints of skunkyness and maize. Like crapped dishmater...

Noi Voi Century Beer Pilsener;Lainate, Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlsberg Italia;Canned. Limpid wellow color, little shining. Compact and enough dense foam. Medium malt, herbaceous and alcoholic scent. Enough decided taste even if not particularly good. Strongly alcoholic rumor. Discreetly pungent finish.
Noi Voi Century Beer Pilsener;Lainate, Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlsberg Italia;looks like a cheap mainstream beer brewed for a supermarket - clear golden colour with a nice foamy head and a nice lace, grainy and metallic hoppiness, sweet and medium-bodied with a dry and aggressiv grainy finish - very dubious

Novecento Pellizza da Volpedo;Casatenovo (LC), Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Novecento;Pale blond color. Very nice aroma of hop. Dry mouthfeel, good malt and very good hopping. Aromatic palate, just a bit too short.
Crater Pilsener;Rotorua, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crater Brewing;"On tap at Pig and Whistle Pub in Rotorua and slod as ""Swine Lager"". Bright golden colour with small head, mild bitterness with smokey aftertaste. Very littel aroma but what aroma there is is sweet malty/citrus."
Crater Pilsener;Rotorua, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crater Brewing;"Pale gold, coarse carbonation, tightish white head. Sweet, apple-like aroma with a metallic hint. Smooth malty taste with a hint of hop, and a notable alcohol taste despite the low abv. Flavours and aromas become very ""appley"" as it warms."
Crater Pilsener;Rotorua, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crater Brewing;looked and tasted like something which should have the words ’premium’ and ’dry’ on the label. a very well-hidden lack of alcohol. no nz saaz, let alone the czech stuff. but i do like bottles with handles
Crater Pilsener;Rotorua, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crater Brewing;"Watery as hell. A faint appley sweetness, and a dry vacuum of a finish. Faint smell of ants and acetic infection provides the only ""interest"". If this is their pilsener I can't see how their ""lager"" could be any less hoppy."

Crater Lager;Rotorua, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crater Brewing;Boy, you really know who your mates are when they send you a bottle that they rate as their worst ever beer. Ta Beerledgend, no really!!! To be fair I think my sample was better than his as I don’t really detect the acidity. The aroma is actually a bit on the H2Sl side which hits you as soon as the top is popped. This dies away when poured and left to sit though. Well, this is a pale and weak looking sample. Light yellow with a billowy head that soon dissipates. There is no nose after a while and certainly no real hop presence either in aroma nor taste. The taste is simply missing, it is a beer but by definition only. Certainly a contender for a drainpour but nothing yet is worse than my sample of Michelob Ultra.
Crater Lager;Rotorua, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crater Brewing;Clear Golden colour with big fluffy head. No aroma and tatsed very acidic, will put down to bad batch, will need to rerate on next trip.
Beer na Beer! Pale Pilsen;Laguna, Philippines;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Asia Brewery Inc.;Tasted this one on 1 litre bottle 2016 and thought it didn't taste anything, now it's the othe way around, San Miguel Pilsen have started making beer with less taste and Beer na Beer makes it taste more.
Beer na Beer! Pale Pilsen;Laguna, Philippines;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Asia Brewery Inc.;Clear golden yellow body with a white head that didn't live very long. It smells of bread with a touch of honey. These seem inaccurate though, maybe I'm getting sick and it's affecting my senses. It's smooth and bread tasting. And highly carbonated on palate.

Maivisto Paciana;Sedrina (Bergamo, BG), Italy;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Maivisto;Draught at the brewpub. Proprietor has told me that it’s a Vienna style but he wasn’t much convinced.

Has an excellent dark malt aroma. A little less impressive in the mouth, but with a strong roasty finish. Really not bad at all. I don’t understand why the brewery call it a Münchner. It’s way too roasty and much more like a sweetish Schwarzbier. The beer is brewed in Portugal by Drinkin, a subsidiary of the Brazilian Cintra Group."

Zupanič Temno;Maribor, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Zupanič;Deep reddish brown coloured, firm small beige head.

Kuhnhenn Dunkel Weiss;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Sain sen kollegalta syntymäpäiväni. Maukas, kevyt mutta ei mitään erikoista!!
Kuhnhenn Dunkel Weiss;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Bottle from Mike. This was poured into a weizen glass. The appearance was a milky soft brown color with a foamy finger and a half’s worth of head. Mild lace, somewhat messy, sliding. The aroma had some toast, light clove, some white bread, even lighter banana esters. Milk chocolate with a little bit of caramel at the very end. The flavor blended the banana sweetness to the clove somewhat sweet with spicy under touches. Light bubblegum. Nice aftertaste of the bubblegum, wheat and caramel. Quick toast-like to bubblegum sort of sweet finish. The feel was between light and medium bodied with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fairly light. ABV felt appropriate. No wheat kick as I usually expect that from the style. Semi-smooth along my tongue. Overall, mostly nice dunkelweizen, seemed aged to me, but I can’t argue because I don’t get to try a lot of this style given where I currently live.
Kuhnhenn Dunkel Weiss;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap @ Kuhnhenn: Semi-murky chestnut brown pour with a soapy, bubbly khaki film across the top, settling to a mild collar. Aroma of old banana bread, clove, toasted wheat, some stale toffee, & a hint of spicy yeast esters. Gives off a slightly medicinal, phenolic tone but it isn’t too overpowering. Flavor is soft, light. Banana esters, spicy yeast, clove, mild bubblegum, hints of mint, caramel, burnt toast, prune, & some faint anise. Again, a mild phenol character in the finish lends a slight medicinal vibe. Not a bad dunkelweizen, but could use a little polishing.
Kuhnhenn Dunkel Weiss;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kuhnhenn Brewing;9th September 2011 Cloudy dark brown beer, small cream coloured head. Light semi dry palate. Tangy wheaty citrus, bordering on sour. Mild caramel in the background. Whisper of chocolate. Semi dry finish. Nice tangy fruits in these Kuhnhenn wheats!
Kuhnhenn Dunkel Weiss;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Refrigerated bottle from FlandersNed poured into a weizen glass. Pours translucent medium brown with small off-white head. Little lacing, medium body, low carbonation, and tart aroma. Taste is tart lemon, banana, some roasted malt, and some caramel.
Kuhnhenn Dunkel Weiss;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"Served side by side with Kuhnhenn Hefeweiss. Shared with Mike & Matt. The beer appears a mildly hazy, mahogany shade of brown. An off-white, bordering on light tan, head measures approximately 1/4"". After a few moments, the head settles to a thin wispy layer. The aroma is far more assertive than the Hefeweiss. Banana, malt, light spices, sweet bread, sugar. The flavor is nice and enjoyable. Plenty of banana presence. Akin to banana bread. Sweet, but not too. Nice notes of bread and brown sugar. Thin to medium bodied, with adequate carbonation. Alcohol presence a non factor. Overall, a decent brew, though still short of the high marks set by the authentic German examples of the style. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 08-15-2011"
Kuhnhenn Dunkel Weiss;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Bottle. Sour wheat malt, funky yeasty aroma. Hazy brown with a minimal head. Sour yeasty wheat malt flavor, very citric. Light body and carbonation.
Kuhnhenn Dunkel Weiss;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Bottle. Banana, clove and lactic wheat/caramel malt aroma. Cloudy orange brown with small head. Sweet-tart lemon, banana, and toasted wheat malt flavor. Nice - not as sweet as the typical dunkelweizen.
Kuhnhenn Dunkel Weiss;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kuhnhenn Brewing;12oz bottle picked up at one of the best beer stores around, Champane’s! It pours a mahogany sort of darkness with a light tan head floating around on the top. The aroma is all earthy and minerally and fruity with sort of wheat notes around the edges. The taste is oddly similar and a mix of dark fruits and earthiness are cut with a mild dry sort of mineral note. These notes soften a bit with a quick shot of a wheat like sensation into the finish.
Kuhnhenn Dunkel Weiss;Warren, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Shared by Ibrew2or3. Pours a hazy caramel color with a thin tan head. Lots of caramel and fruit in the nose. Tase is slightly tart and sweet. Medium bodied with a dry finish. Not bad.

Davidson Brothers ESB;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a ruddy burnt orange almost red color with a thin finger’s worth of off white foamy head. Subtle stringy lace. The aroma had some biscuits and white bread with grassy dried grass. Some dried fruity esters. Earthiness at the end. The flavor was malty with a touch of sweetness from the biscuits and white bread. Crisp grassy hop bitterness. Biscuits run with the hops into the aftertaste and on into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt fine. Overall, good ESB for what it is.
Davidson Brothers ESB;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;In short: A lame generic sweet Amber Ale trying to pass as an ESB How: Tap at brewpub The look: Clear golden blonde body topped by a small white head In long: Nose is light leafy hops presence. Taste has semi-toasted honeyed malts that taste like a cheap sweet commercial cookie. Hopping is too weak and only add weak juicy leafy and slightly citrusy notes. More like a poorly made Amber Ale than an ESB. Another shitty beer from Davidson Brothers, when I go to this brewpub I love to yell “Fire!!!” and then watch the disappointment in the faces of the customers when they realize they are not going to burn to death and will have to continue drinking their beer.
Davidson Brothers ESB;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Bland, mostly flavorless brew. Overly malty, metallic, soapy flavor. Had it as part of a sampler, and it tasted the same as most of the other beers on the rack. Poorly executed, clumsy attempt at an ESB.
Davidson Brothers ESB;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Pours a muddy medium brown. Not much head. Light caramel toffee aroma and taste. Thin consistency. Bitters. Ok but not amazing by any neans.
Davidson Brothers ESB;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Brown with a white head. Aroma is toasty malt, light molasses, and a bit of earthy hops. Flavor follows along the aroma with the malts really toning down the lightly grassy/earthy hops. Decent.
Davidson Brothers ESB;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;A - Pours a rich amber-red color with a finger of off-white head atop. The head fades down to a thin ring around the glass leaving behind some lacing in the process. S - Aroma is a mix of sweet caramel malts and some fruity aromas (cherry and apple). There is also some hops and some spices in the background. T - Starts off with a mix of some sweet caramel malt and some light sweet fruit flavors. Though the middle some citrus hops come through alongside some bitterness. The finish is a mix of caramel flavor and bit of bready malts that lingers nicely. M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very smooth and crisp with a nice mix of sweet and bitterness that lingers. D - Very drinkable. The hop/malt balance is really nice and the touch of added fruity flavors mixes in well. Really smooth and feels refreshing.
Davidson Brothers ESB;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Draft @ the brewpub. Clear amber-brown color. Aroma has strong grassy hops, a lot more than the style usually calls for. Some light tea aspects as well. Flavor is also a tea and grassy hops mix, the tea stronger here. Its an American ESB, and ASB.
Davidson Brothers ESB;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Although very translucent, and golden in color, this beer is very alive with a good fizzy sensation that stays on the lips. The bitterness is well evident, but not overpowering, and has a very crisp finish. This is easily my favorite choice when it is available in the restaurant.
Davidson Brothers ESB;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;29.04.06 Tap at TAPNY. Another complete butter bomb from these folks. I understand that there can be a bit of diacetyl in an ESB, but this was just over the top. Anyway, a caramel colored beer looks promising beneath a sturdy white head. Aroma is, as noted, pungent with butter and less so with touches of cider/apple must. Some mild earthiness in the background. Slick on the palate. Terrible. I wish I had the version the Canadians were drinking.
Davidson Brothers ESB;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;on tap-pours an offwhite head with gold color. Aroma is malt, hops with lots of floral. Taste follows. Mild carbonation.

Fresh grain and hops flavour and grapefruit mixed in. Good flavour and well balanced yet too light. I'd encourage the brewery to keep this in their line-up with minor tweaking. Good.

Coopers Cave Bohemian;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Coopers Cave Ale Company;April 2004. Hazy blonde with white head. Fresh malts and spices in nose, with a peppery malty taste with lots of german hops . Good bodied. Again, good beer.

Coopers Cave Bohemian;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Grainy, oxidized aroma. Hazy blond body with big white fully diminishing head. No hops apparent but there is something funky and sour. Slick, smooth mouthfeel. I suspect something is awry with this one and find it hard to believe I was sampling the same glass as the Cap... We had very different impressions. On tap at the brewery.
Coopers Cave Bohemian;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Coopers Cave Ale Company;(Draught) Sampled at the brewery. Was told there was Saaz hops in here... I don't think so? Nice head retention. Good grapefruit nose and flavour. Creamy and lasting bitterness. My favourite beer by this brewery.
Troy USB Light;Troy, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brown's Brewing Company;April 2004. Very light yellow beer, almost dilute. Lightly aromatic hops and beery aroma. Very thin lemony tatse but with floral hops. Watery body. Quite good for a light/low carb.
Troy USB Light;Troy, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brown's Brewing Company;Very mild hop aroma. Really still, low carbonation, no head and very pale body. Sweet, slightly malty and a touch toasty with light hop flavour. Body is a bit on the thin side and it's not very enticing looking - but hey, what would you expect from a light beer? This is one of the best American Lights I've tried. On tap at the brewpub.

It is pale and sweetish with the orange detectable, although the coriander is very faint, just a slight spiciness in the aftertaste.

Aroma is melon and sweet rice. Palate is medium. There is just enough thickness to it to complement the sweet/balanced creaminess of the flavor, which matches the nose with melon and lightly sweet rice.

Abbeydale Black Bishop;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Porter;Abbeydale Brewery;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Red-hued dark beer, with a nice cream head. Very good sweet hop aroma. Whilst dark, this is unmistakeably Abbeydale, with their trademark, clean hop flavour. Lacking dark beer chocolate-ness, this ends up being closer to a perky Scwarzbier. Later some roast appears in the background. Very odd. Tasty, but impossible to pin down.

Aberdeen Killarney Kopper;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;At brewery only: Hazy reddish amber hue with small frothy head and good lace. The faint aroma hints of toasted malts, some caramel, floral and grassy hops, hazelnut, orange zest, sea salt, and zesty yeast esters. The taste starts citrusy and mildely hopped. Undertones of toast, nuts and caramel. Salty and bitter finish, but not too big. The mouthfeel is dry, smooth, and lively, very refreshing. Would classify as an Irish Ale but really a hybrid of Scottish and Brown Ales. This beer is the standard quaffable stuff. Good with a meal.

Custom Brewcrafters St. Patricks Irish Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Custom Brewcrafters;The body has a very deep amber color with good clarity. On top sits a tall light tan head that was produced by a fairly vigorous poor. It slowly fades but hangs on well, keeping a thin covering to the end. First off the aroma hits with a pleasant bouquet of floral, citrus and herbal hop notes with sweet maltiness coming in right after. The flavor follows suit on the aroma with a good mix of hops and sweet lightly toasted maltiness. The floral and citrus hop flavors are up front with sweet and very lightly toasted malt flavor moving in to the middle to balance the hops. On the finish herbal like hops take back over and bring dryness and pleasant bitterness. The palate has an easy drinking medium body that slides right down with just enough carbonation to give it life.

Overall, not a bad beer.
Pizza Port Lucidity Belgian Golden Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);(Draft: Pizza Port in Solana Beach, CA) Hmm, there’s no question about the Belgian notes in this beer, clove and Belgian yeasts mainly, but the thing I notice most is the bitterness in the finish. It’s really a counterpoint to the sweetness, but it’s a bit harsh to me. A fair amount of alcohol also has presence, but it’s not overwhelming. Medium bodied, but there is enough sweetness in this beer that the palate remains pretty substantial right through to the finish. The bitterness in the finish doesn’t really cut into the sweetness too much, but the beer does finish crisper than it would normally. It pours a hazy golden color, with just the occasional tiny carbonation bubble rising slowly through the beer. The white head is small when poured, and settles to a thin filmly layer. This is a very flavorful Belgian Golden, but I would like it a whole lot more if the bitter finish mellowed out a bit.

An attractive off-white head sits atop the brew which laces very well. Aroma is Belgian-ish in that yeasty wild way. Nice over-ripe banana flavors and some light cheese notes as well. Flavor is a little more mild than expected. Not quite the yeasty bite that I expected but still a nice Belgian roundness exists. Body is nice and silky and finishes with a dry, clean characteristic.

Landshuter Hochzeitsbier;Landshut, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Landshuter Brauhaus;Das Hochzeitsbier vom Landshuter Brauhaus sieht rötlich-golden aus und die Schaumkrone ist appetitlich vorhanden. Dieses Bier riecht schon relativ alkoholisch schwer, mit Hopfen und Malz. Einstieg ist sehr gemischt - anfänglich schmeckt man den Festbier Charakter, aber die Würz-Süsse ist etwas unrund.

Bare aroma, dark brown body, solid white head, decent lacing, fairly watery/oily, burnished finish, not one to cross the road. Premium!?
Acorn Forester;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Acorn Brewery;"September 10, 2017 - at Cask Pub & Kitchen - on handpull cask. Clear refractive pale amber-gold with a smallish but lasting mottled off-white head. Dry, dry leafy aroma, black tea and tart fruit; taste follows - like slightly sweetened black tea with some green leafy hop bitterness; both odd, but interesting and different. Airy, light body, a whisper of acidity in the medium bitter slightly astringent finish - never quite reaches palate-coating levels; could be a little maltier as a bitter, but glad I tried it."

Flowery, citrusy hop nose but tea flavour lets it down. Creamy mouthfeel and lingering finish but this is average at best I’m afraid.
Acorn Forester;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Acorn Brewery;A Mes rate: Cask at the Market Porter. Mid gold with a decent white head. Nice grapefuity hop nose. Thin malty tea flavour. Really not my thing at all. As soon as I detect tea in anything I am totally put off. Thin yet sticky mouthfeel. Not my thing.

Sly Fox Styrian IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;"Draught at Bar Great Harry. Hazy orange with a thick off-white head leaving webby lacing. Aroma of sweet orange/citrus, caramel, pine with floral, tea and spice notes. Flavor includes the rich SF IPA project malt body with a concentrated sweet omni-citrus component(orange, grapefruit, tangerine). Also apricot, peach and a ""root extract"" spiciness (I’m thinking birch beer with hints of licorice). A nice smooth hoppy flavor on the finish rather than just a generalized astringent grapefruit/pine bitterness. I really liked this one."
Sly Fox Styrian IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Hazy orange-amber beer with a thin white head. Aroma is awesome. Rich orange and tropical fruit over a rich herbal/zesty spiciness. Nicely fruity and spicy with a bit of chewy sweet maltiness on the back. Full-bodied with a great balance of fruitiness and spiciness. Another great single varietal IPA. Lingering resiny bitterness with a nice fruity finish.

Pours a slightly cloudy coppery orange amber with a medium sized beige head. Aroma of grassy hops, tangy citrus and faint pine. Taste of tangy citrus(grapefruit)with hints of grassy hops and a bit of pine. Similar to other Sly Fox IPA’s.
Sly Fox Styrian IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;I would have thought this one would be similar to Fuggles IPA considering it is pretty much the same hop. However, this IPA goes to show you what growing conditions and climate can do to hops. This was actually quite different from the FUggles. Styrian Goldings have muddled herbal character mixed with some fruitiness. Has a wierd spicy bite at the end. Decent bitterness. Oveall pretty good but not my favorite of the experimentals.
Sly Fox Styrian IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery for the IPA Project. Another hop that doesn’t knock my socks off. No bite to it. Nice and clean.

Sly Fox Styrian IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Perhaps the most intersting IPA at the SF IPA event. Never heard of anyone using this hop in an IPA before, but I loved the character it provided. The aroma was pleasantly pungent, and I noticed that this aroma is familiar from past decently hopped Belgian brews that I have had like La Bavaisienne. You really notice the unique hop character in the flavor as well. Very low malt character, but the hops really keep this interesting.

Etna Blackberry Blonde;Etna, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Etna Brewing Company;"Bottle. Translucent straw color, faint nose of wheat malt. Taste is wheat with a strong blackberry flavor. The flavor is not as astringent but reminiscent of cough syrup. Palate is medium to medium thin and not syrupy at all. I""m not a huge fruit beer drinker but this one isn’t bad because of the pleasant wheat malt profile. Very drinkable."

Phillips Phoenix Gold Lager;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Phillips Brewing Co.;"Bottle. Clear light golden pour with a small white head.

Phillips Phoenix Gold Lager;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Phillips Brewing Co.;"Beer 2500 on top of Grouse Mountain after the Grouse Grind. Doesn’t pour any color because I drank it out of the bottle during the lumberjack show. Not an overly sweet lager at all which is nice.

De Prael Juliana;Amsterdam, Netherlands;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brouwerij De Prael;The aroma’s of this beer are a little thin(far away) orange, malts..yeast??

Had some trouble from the tap..maybe the bottle do better.

Alcazar Black Fox;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Alcazar (Shipstone's);Deep brown colour with a ruby tinge. Not as dark as some. I thought I picked up some smoky notes lurking beneath the roast malt on the nose, but I was suffering from a heavy cold, so I was struggling with aromas. The palate was dry and had a slightly mineral/ashy consistency (which I found in a number of the milds at this festival). Light bodied. A decent, traditional, easy drinking mild but nothing really leapt out. Then it is a mild so it wouldn’t be fair to criticise it for not being an attention-grabber. Cask (gravity), Reading beer festival 2005.

Initial metallic aroma with hops later developed sweetness. Thick, oily mouthfeel. Slightly grainy taste with some bitterness though not a lot of impact. Bit warm, to be frank, and well past its best. Disappointing in the light of favourable reviews from raters whose judgment I respect.
Alcazar Vixen's Vice;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Alcazar (Shipstone's);A Sim rate (cask at the Wenlock): Smells of feet, stilton and a bit of apple.

En se foutant complètement du brassage et de la matière première, alors c’est pas mauvais mais l’intérêt est proche du zéro...
Valmy Bière Blanche;Sommepy-Tahure, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie d'Orgemont;"330ml bottle. Slightly cloudy, orangey golden colour with average, frothy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, white head. Minimally weak, spicy and citrusy zesty aroma, notes of coriander, orange, orange zest, sweet-ish, wheaty background.

Blue Ridge (SC) Hurricane Hefeweizen;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Blue Ridge Brewing Co. (SC);Served from tap into a standard pint. Poured a pale yellow with a white head that was minimal and did not linger long. There was no apparent lacing present. The aroma was of a nice sweet malt with hints of wheat and grains. The flavor of this one consisted of citrus and wheat that was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a very nice Hefeweizen that could be compared to a Franziskaner, but is not quite there in flavor. However, this is worth a shot for any Hefe fan out there if you can get your hands on it.
Blue Ridge (SC) Hurricane Hefeweizen;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Blue Ridge Brewing Co. (SC);On tap at the brewpub in Greenville. Bright yellow pour with a decent white head - not murky like a hefe should be. Some cloves and bananas in the aroma.Flavor has some decent coriander notes with some nice bubble gum notes but finishes a bit too tangy. Mouthfeel is thick enough. Slightly below par brewpub hefe.

Blue Ridge (SC) Hurricane Hefeweizen;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Blue Ridge Brewing Co. (SC);A very average take on this style. This one to me is kind of light for the style, with out alot of the yeastiness that I crave, a light clove and banana are present but are definitely afterthoughts. The flavor is kind of musty, damp and sweaty. Other than lacking in body and flavor it was great.

Blue Ridge (SC) Colonel Paris Pale Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Ridge Brewing Co. (SC);Had a quite enjoyable evening at the Blue Ridge Brewing Co. in downtown Greenville, SC yesterday, now to submit my evaluations of their brews. First up was this pale ale, which begins with a clear pale amber color, good lacing but not much head. Has a sweet fresh aroma of fruity hoppiness. The flavor is roasty malt, a little earthy, with a good medium-bodied texture. Maybe a hint of cocoa (?) in the flavor, or maybe I'm misreading a subtle caramel note. Has a unique tropical finish. Good!!! but not as good as their stout. Either way I recommend giving this brew-pub a visit. ---Rated via Beer Buddy

Blue Ridge (SC) Colonel Paris Pale Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Ridge Brewing Co. (SC);Pours clear gold with a large sudsy head. Nice yeasty/citrus aroma. The flavor starts very non-dimemo and finishes with an unpleasant hop flavor that is piney to the point of a soapy flavor. The mouthfeel is thin with heavy carbonation. An unpleasantly off aftertaste follows. Even though I enjoy heavy hops, this beer needs more than just bitterness to be good
Saku Presidendi 8;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pilsener - Imperial;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);"2L PET bottle (Maxima, Rakvere) Why the hate? Malty aroma, sweetish. Paleish. Taste clean and malty, a little sweet. Full smooth palate, carbonation low enough that drinking 2L is feasible. Finish sweet and malty. This is a good ESL, make no doubt. This is better than a lot of so-called ""craft"" beer. And I’m not saying that past midnight after a long sesh, this is the first beer of the day. And, no bullshit, I drank 2L of it, this is remarkably drinkable."
Saku Presidendi 8;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pilsener - Imperial;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);Hard to get. Possibly retired. Last time I had it was more than a year ago. Fortified lager. Malty and with loads of alcohol. Quite a disappointment. Update: 2L bottle from Selver. Extremely thin and tasteless. It is not revolting,it is quite smooth and easy going, but the thickness is really lower than water, considering 7% alcohol.
Saku Presidendi 8;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pilsener - Imperial;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);Bottle from supermarket. Golden color, white head. Sweet taste with mostly malt, citrus, caramel, grain, alcohol. Dry bitter finish with malts. Drinkable brew.
Saku Presidendi 8;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pilsener - Imperial;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);"Can’t really hate this, even if one is sort of supposed to look down on anything of such high alcohol by volume, and such high...volume (67 oz, 2 L). Good balance between malt, alcohol burn, and the expected if suboptimal adjunct lager; all elements are strangely in harmony. Quite drinkable, and better than so many of Saku’s insipid PLs."
Saku Presidendi 8;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pilsener - Imperial;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);2l plastic bottle. Every sip is agony. Like trying to commit suicide in a very slow and painful way. Vodka+beer= this drink.
Saku Presidendi 8;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pilsener - Imperial;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);Pale golden yellow, medium head. Malty aroma with lots of alcohol, some apple notes. The taste is sweet malt and anis, alcohol in the finish. Oily mouthfeel. Drinkable.
Saku Presidendi 8;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pilsener - Imperial;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);2l Bottle - Gold in appearance and it looks rather flat. Alcoholic aroma with some hints of dried apple. Malty and faintly fruity taste with grain and apples standing out. Not very nice at all.
Saku Presidendi 8;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pilsener - Imperial;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);Big murder size plastic bottle (thanks dad!). Deep golden colour with small white head, that disappears quite quickly. Aroma is sweet malts along with with quite much alcoholic notes. Flavour is sweet alcohol along with a big malty body with some honeyish sweetness too. Some slight metallic hints also. Quite nice while cold.
Saku Presidendi 8;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pilsener - Imperial;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);Bottle. Light amber with off-white mostly diminishing head. Aroma of slightly sweet malt. Somewhat metallic in the flavor. Average finish with a dash of alcohol.
Saku Presidendi 8;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pilsener - Imperial;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);Bottle. Clear golden colour with a medium moslty diminishing white head. Sweet aroma and sweet taste of malts and alcohol. Boring pretty much standard estonian beer. This is a bit stronger than most estonian beer with a better palate but high Abv. is not everything.

Nose is oxidised, caramel, figgy jam, wood, light barrel. Taste comprises tarte fruit, meaty notes, nutty, faint whisky, oxidised rinse. Medium bodied, limited carbonation, drying close. I figure some ageing hasn’t done too much damage to this one!
Borve Ale;Aberdeenshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Borve;Bottle shared at the tropical Croydonia tasting. No date on the bottle. Little did I think I would get my hands on this Aberdeenshire rarity!!!! It pours deep brown with small beige head. The nose is soft, juicy, plenty of berry, jammy stuff, light whisky, wood, earth, Vimto, blackcurrant and raspberry. The taste is smooth, woody, earth, some alcohol warmth, medicinal, leather, mild acidity, jammy fruits, raspberry, salty aspect, oily and light metallic notes. Medium body and soft carbonation. Good depth of flavour. This has somehow held up or evolved into an interesting beverage. Rather impressive.
Borve Ale;Aberdeenshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Borve;Bottle share at Paul’s. Thanks Scopes! ’Borve Ale Air a Ghrudaireachal’, no date or ABV. Dark reddy brown, still, small bubbly tan head. Aroma is tangy lemon, almost bretty, background peach and air freshener. Body is medium, rounded and smooth. Taste is berries, light citrus, coins, not getting much whisky. For an aged beer at this ABV, I was surprised this was even drinkable...but I actually quite liked it.
Borve Ale;Aberdeenshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Borve;1st July 2015 Tropical Croydonia Bottleshare. Thanks to Paul for this museum piece. Clear amber beer, a smattering of short lived pale cream colour bubbles. Woody caramel on those nose plus a little brett. Palate is light and semi dry, unsurprisingly - no carbonation. For it’s age it is pretty complex. Yep some knackered oxidised malts but also bitter tangy caramel, light wood and savoury saltiness. Whisper of whisky? Maybe out the corner of your eye! Light dry finish. A salty old sea dog of a beer which I genuinely enjoyed and could still taste half hour later!
Borve Ale;Aberdeenshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Borve;Bottle shared in London - many thanks to Paul. Pours clearish amber with a bubbly tan head.

Borve Ale;Aberdeenshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Borve;Bottle in Croydonia. Thanks to Paul for this much sought after Scottish tick! Honestly, you don’t know shit about Scottish beer unless you’ve tried Borve. Amber pour with a small white head. Nose of apple jam and croissants. Some red fruits. Mellow, sweet and inviting. Taste is a touch acidic and thin, but not unappealing. Raspberry and brown bread, earthy. ,medium body. Oily.
Borve Ale;Aberdeenshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Borve;First tasted this at the Paisley Beer Festival in April 1994. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear copper red in colour with a thin loose white head. Tart redcurant fruit in the malty aroma. Thin mouthfeel and poor lacing. Pale malts give a slight maltloaf base laced with cherries and hedgerow fruit. Metallic tang from the hops and boiled vegetable note give a bitter bite to the aftertaste. Finish is slightly sweet with dry woody notes. An ok session ale that you can tell from the malt profile it hails from Scotland.
Borve Ale;Aberdeenshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Borve;Vintage bottle, consumed at GBBF, day 5 on 5 August 2006. Wasn’t immediately apparent which version this was as there was no ABV on the label. Dead and buried. An ex-beer. Shuffled off this mortal coil etc etc. Indeterminate age. Woody with balsamic vinegar. Nothing else left. Default score.

Rock Bottom Arlington Snake Chaser Stout;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Arlington;a decent little irish stout after a loooong day of drinking. Had all the good characteristics of a irish stout, nice light head, easy going flavor and a great palate. A decent stout...
Rock Bottom Arlington Snake Chaser Stout;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Arlington;Served on nitro-tap at the Ballston VA location. Appearance: Extremely dark brown, approaching black. Creamy ivory colored head that is über-thick, just like a nitro stout should look. Reverse cascade effect and all that rot. The head stuck around for awhile and left clingy bits of foam at first and then thick sheets of lace at the end. Aroma: Faint bready malts with chocolate and burnt malt/toast notes. Faint is the operative word here. Flavor: Burnt bready malts, slightly bitter, with mild black licorice on the finish. Palate: Creamy and smooth, remarkably light (and in a good way). Overall: Modelled on either Guinness or Murphy’s, but better. Brewed for this store’s celebration of St. Patrick’s day. Still in good shape and relatively tasty if you like nitro-stouts. There are more flavorful stouts available, but this one wasn’t bad. I’d get it if it were a regular at that location.

Černá Hora Black Hill;Černá Hora, Czech Republic;Flavored - Other;Pivovar Černá Hora (Pivovary Lobkowicz);Piwo bardzo specyficzne. O mocnym i intensywnym, a w zasadzie drapierznym aromatem szpitala i lekarstw. W smaku wyczuwalne ziola, przeroznego typu, podobne w smaku do Becherovki. Piana spora i trwala. Kolor amber, finisz mocno wytrawny i ziolowy. Likierowy posmak. Piwo trudne w odbiorze i nie do codziennego sporzycia. Polecam ciekawskim bo to zupelnie inna bajka niz sztandardowe jasne lagery.

Černá Hora Black Hill;Černá Hora, Czech Republic;Flavored - Other;Pivovar Černá Hora (Pivovary Lobkowicz);"Bottle. What a pleasant surprise! This beer feels like a regular Czech lager infused with two shots of non-alcoholic Becherovka. There is some malt and hops, but also notes of ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, coriander and honey. The beer is rather dry with a very dry finish, where the hops go hand in hand with the herbs to provide an underlined bitterness. This is supposed to be a ""beer aperitif"" and it works very well."

Aroma is mild with a whiff of grass or dried out hay but also has some notes of spice or banana like esters.

Pegas Tmavý Ležák 12°;Brno, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Minipivovar Pegas;My Bottom Line: Roasted malts and raisin-y edges swing to herbal hops and their bitterness in this balanced Tmavy. Further Personal Perceptions: -A creamy head of foam laces atop the dark brown-tinged blackness. -Body is lean and carbonation frothy. -Though this was a nice Tmavy overall, I didn’t feel like the malt flavors were as well extracted as that of the best examples of the style. On tap at the brewpub.

7 Stern Hanf;Vienna, Austria;Flavored - Other;7 Stern Bräu;Pours a hazy golden yellow on tap with fluffy white foam that dissipates slowly to leave moderate lace. Aroma of herbal and citrus hop notes over light biscuit and hay malt notes, with a clean German lager yeast behind. Taste follows, definitely not a hemp flavor like they tout, but a decent hop punch to an a mostly clean lager, a touch of diacetyl here. Not bad, but nothing special.

Dominion Second Runnings Bitter;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Had this beer when it was a one-off at the Lupulin Slam in DC in late 2003 but, as it’s apparently been put on at the brewpub, I dug out my notes and am rating it. Auburn, not much head. Nose slight, maybe a few hops. Flavor a bit bready and lightly nutty, hops make a brief visit. A mite thin. Eh.
Dominion Second Runnings Bitter;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Admittedly my palate was shot from the previous 3 or 4 IIPAs I had consumed, but here is my report. Cloudy light brown smallish white head. Aroma was mildly floral hoppy and slighlty bready. The flavor was OK, mild floral hops and light malt. Body is medium-light with a very quickly diminishing aftertaste. Interesting attempt at a small beer, I might have enjoyed this one more under different circumstances.
Dominion Second Runnings Bitter;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Setting: Served on cask conditioned system using the ol’ fashion hand pump at the brewery. Appearance: Very cloudy lemon yellow with a smallish head of white foam. Nice lacing left on the glass as this was consumed. Aroma: Yeasty and bready with a nice solid presence of East Kent Golding hops (per the brewer). Flavor: Aaaah.. greatness. A mild taste of bittering hops with a good solid pale malt backing. Palate: Goes down quite smooth, on the lighter side of medium bodied. Overall: Goddamn is this a fine session beer. Great with food, too. I had mine with fish and chips. Other: One of the hits at the Lupulin Slam for me. Hoppy in a different way, and boy did this taste like heaven after 3 high octane IIPA’s! This is a small beer brewed using the spent grains of Millennium.
Søbogaard Tors Hammer Mjød;Borup, Denmark;Mead;Søbogaard;Clear pale golden colour. Great aroma with notes of honey and spices. Sweet taste with light bitterness and spicy notes. Full body with a long finish. The alcohol leaves a burning sensation. This is one of the better meads I have had. The spices and the bitterness balance the sweetness. It might improve with a slightly lower abv.

Not a hint of alcohol, just some glorious cheap Coca Cola notes along with some fanbloodytastic spice. So drinkable it’s downright dangerous. Mad as a bag of frogs and I could easily be hovvering the lawn drunk on this. Excellent.

Chelsea Porter of Authority;Bronx, New York, United States;Porter;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Location: Cask at Pony Bar (HK), 5/15/13 Aroma: The aroma is on the sour side, with some underlying roasted malts Appearance: It poured a dark brown color with a (large for a cask beer) frothy beige head Flavor: The taste is a little sour as well, with some light-medium malty sweetness as well Palate: The body is light-medium, and it has a very smooth and creamy cask feel to it Overall Impression: Oddly, this tasted more like a sour than a porter. Accidental sour? I can’t say for sure, but it somehow sorta kinda worked. Weird stuff. I’m not sure how to rate it as I’m not sure what the intent was here.
Chelsea Porter of Authority;Bronx, New York, United States;Porter;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;had this on my trip through NYC last year and just found the napkin I wrote it one. Dark with a wispy head. Light sour, roasted malts, chocolate, cocoa (there did seem to be both), with some molasses. Flavor is similar with nice bittersweet chocolate. Lightly dry and sour finish. Thin bodided. Refreshing on this warm evening. (Cask at Blind Tiger)
Chelsea Porter of Authority;Bronx, New York, United States;Porter;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Surprisingly timid and simplistic porter from a brewery that has not won me yet. Appealing fruity nose soon evolves into recurrent jamminess which quickly bores. The timid roastiness does not help, making the fruitiness dominating and accentuating its tartness. Still, it’s so light on the palate that you can’t accuse it of being astringent. That does not make it a winner though.
Chelsea Porter of Authority;Bronx, New York, United States;Porter;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Nitro at Brazen Head. Chocolate and coffee flavors with a minerally lining. Full bodied, even and smooth, retaining the robust and roasty flavors of the style without any acidic distractions or off-notes. Nicely brewed porter.
Chelsea Porter of Authority;Bronx, New York, United States;Porter;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;In short: Good sweet fruity malt backbone and a strong hop bite. Solid. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Black body with a very small beige head In long: On one side medium roastiness, some burnt raisins, a little molasses and an overall crusty baked dessert sweetness. On the other side a big bite of fresh green hops, a little lemony flavour and a light tartness. Well balanced. Solid brew. You need to respect the porter of authority.

Chelsea Porter of Authority;Bronx, New York, United States;Porter;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Cask at Blind Tiger. Aroma of roast, coffee, smoke. Flavor of roast, coffee, sweet notes, and a hint of dried dark fruits. Dry for a porter. On the watery side. Ok.
Chelsea Porter of Authority;Bronx, New York, United States;Porter;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;On cask at Blind Tiger. Pours black with no real head. Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate. Flavor of light fruitiness initially, followed by roasted malt and bitter chocolate. Palate is weak and watery. It was an ok beer but nothing I’d seek out again.
Chelsea Porter of Authority;Bronx, New York, United States;Porter;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Nose reveals dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malt, ebony, with a trace of auburn at the sides, small tan head, nice lace also.

John Harvards Double Trouble Bock;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Weak aroma of sweet caramel unleashing tired roastiness and sweet nuttiness...Earthiness joins the caramel on the palate and both shrug off the few hops...A nice bock, but nothing worthy of a pilgrimage...

Lokys Sviesusis;Mažeikiai, Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;UAB Brauer;Light yellow colored, this kind of hazy appearance makes me kind of suspicious. Little vanishing white head. Aroma is rude with sweetness, ryeness, butterness and skunky yeastiness, mild alcohol comes up also. Thin to medium bodied. Flavor has also kind of spoiled rye in it with sweetness and skunkiness, aftertaste is dry and skunky. Phew how bad brew!

Lokys Sviesusis;Mažeikiai, Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;UAB Brauer;Light copper with visible carbonation but the head quickly fades. Sewagey, appley aroma. Almost malty palate but still mostly sugar, apple skins and vegetal notes. Not as offensive as their other beers.

Barley and Hops Lust For Lupulin;Frederick, Maryland, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Barley and Hops Grill and Microbrewery;"I stopped by this brew pub on a business trip and it was definitely worth the stop. This highly aromatic copper colored ale had a wonderful floral and fruit nose. The taste started out with a hint on sweetness followed by an extremely astringent grapefruit finish. I am not a ""hop head’, but this brew was wonderful."
Barley and Hops Lust For Lupulin;Frederick, Maryland, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Barley and Hops Grill and Microbrewery;Pumpkin orange with a firm head. The beer has a malty character, but the hops are too bitter -- I like hops, but there needs to be more balance between the bitter and the hops flavor. Strong, but just missing some of the flavors I expect in a double IPA. More like an extra-bitter IPA.
Barley and Hops Lust For Lupulin;Frederick, Maryland, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Barley and Hops Grill and Microbrewery;This beer rocks! Murky, deep golden ale with orange highlights. Small, fizzy, white head with decent retention. The nose reveals notes of toffee, apricot and alcohol. Heavily hopped with a huge malt backbone. Blasts of caramel, butterscotch and fuzzy fruit up front. Big, juicy hops do a great job of tempering the malty sweetness. Full-bodied with an oily/syrupy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Lengthy, bitter, very dry finish. HopHeads should really dig this one. World class brew from a much improved microbrewery!

Light bodied and a grainy texture. A dryish, slightly appley, citrus hop bitterness in the finish. It’s not a bad beer, the apple actually adds to the character of this pale, zesty ale.

Aroma is wheat, spice, lemon, citrus, banana, and grass. Taste is banana, coriander, light citrus, clove, cracker malt, and some minerals.

Paulaner Bräuhaus (Brewpub Munich) Paulus;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Paulaner Bräuhaus München (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);On tap at Paulaner Im Tal. Perfectly cloudy and dirty/rusty caramel brown in color with a booming khaki tan head with circular lacing tracts. Spicy nutmeg on liquefied bananas gets us going early on, deployed synchronously with wafts of cocoa butter on melted caramel, cloves, pepper and a touch of orange crème toffee chews. A flavor to savor. Refreshing caramel and pecan toffee ribbons lay a sweet coalescing flavor blanket. Sweet brown sugared dates with some a batch of banana honey bunches of oats. Condoning and honed carbonation allows the pepper, cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg quad-factor to pipe up the mouth feel. Hints of spicy rye curves into a liquefied and brown sugar sweetened pumpernickel tract. Phenomenally balanced with an overarching, flavorful theme. Brown sugared and browned bananas hit nutmeg in a delicately significant manner in the finish, with some buttery caramel nougats, serving due process to the stuff that legends are made of.

Paulaner Bräuhaus (Brewpub Munich) Paulus;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Paulaner Bräuhaus München (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);"Bottled, sampled at the Paulaner brewpub in Munich. Strongly yeasty aroma, lots of the traditional banana and clove, some faint alcohol and plenty of light, milky caramel sweetness, also very fruity with notes of apple, pear and lemon, and accompanied by rich, bready malts. Exceedingly cloudy amber color, spectacular lacing and a nicely lasting ivory head. Flavor profile is big, estery and malty, spicy with the voluminous amounts of Weizen yeast, some light brown sugar sweetness throughout. Finishes strongly, some faint peppery alcohol and balanced malt/yeast attributes, also some gently spicy hop bitterness. Palate is quite effervescent; medium-full body. A good example of the style."
Bluegrass Your Maibock;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bluegrass Brewing Company;"Ten years since the last rating... Aroma: Light overall but bread at the fore; very slight fruity esters (apple) with a little caramel. Appearance: Slightly hazy copper with a sticky bone head. Flavor: Bread is more spiced and there is a light herbal bitterness in the background; the beer becomes a little more toasty and semi dry toward the finish.

Bluegrass Your Maibock;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draft - a nice surprise!

A good one!
Bluegrass Professor Gessers Mind Numbing Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;750 ml bottle picked up at the Party Source from backlog notes 07/08. Pours a hazy orange amber color with a medium sized beige head. The aroma and flavor have caramel malts, sweet candied fruit, citrus, pineapple, some resiny hops, mild earthy notes. Definitely more sweet than bitter and I like my DIPAsto be bitter.
Bluegrass Professor Gessers Mind Numbing Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draught@Mikkeller Bar, Copenhagen (backlog). Deep golden colour, small white head. Aroma is fruits, grass, some vanilla, toffee and wood. Flavour is very similar in a nice balance. Hides the alcohol very well.
Bluegrass Professor Gessers Mind Numbing Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;On tap, nice amber/copper pour. Very earthy/herbal aroma. Notes of some floral hops character but no citrus hop character to speak of. Decent Double IPA but not the most complex, seems a bit standard issue. So not bad, probably good for someone just developing a taste for hoppier brews.
Bluegrass Professor Gessers Mind Numbing Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Bottle - thanks RJ5020! Pours cloudy deem amber-brown with a medium tan head that dissipates with good lacing. Aroma is malty - caramel, biscuit, some pine and herbal aromas as well. Flavor is medium sweet, caramel, toffee, candi sugar, overripe citrus. Some bitterness as well, but not strong at all, with some odd herbal, almost floral notes as well. I can’t call it a bad beer, but it is definitely not in my wheelhouse. This is pushing sweet hoppy barleywine territory more than DIPA.
Bluegrass Professor Gessers Mind Numbing Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Cloudy, dark amber with a yellowish-tan head. Scent is caramel, herbal, fruity, earthy. Taste is a strong earthy bitter....sugary. Dark carmelized fruit, toffee malt. Substantial leafy bitter.

Bluegrass Professor Gessers Mind Numbing Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Originally reviewed: 12/21/09. Bottle received from bamadog in a recent trade. Thanks for the beer! Poured into my pint glass. Pours a very cloudy dark copper with a thick beige head on top. Decent retention. Left some pretty sip rings on the glass. That was the best part of the beer. Scents of toffee, bread, and earth. Not what I would expect from an IPA. Hmm. Decent body on this beer. Nice mellow smoothness with a touch of carbonation play on the tongue. Flavor is weird. Dull earthy bitterness, caramel, and a slight tart funkiness on the finish. This is strange. Not sure what I think of this beer. It’s interesting, to say the least. I wouldn’t go out of my way to grab this one again. Too bad, I liked the other BBC brews I’ve had.
Bluegrass Professor Gessers Mind Numbing Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;750ml bottle courtesy of Acknud. Thanks a million Bill. Pours a hazy burnt orange with a one finger creamy beige head. Not much in the way of lace, but the head collapses until there is just a half dollar size bit floating like a water toy in the middle of my glass. Luscious candy and cherry aroma with some hop bite. Very much like a Barlywine. Flavor was a nice combo of dark fruit, brown sugar and fruity hops. Palate is moderate with a finish that is sweet and bitter simutaniously. This doesn’t seem to be highly rated, but I thought it was terrific.
Bluegrass Professor Gessers Mind Numbing Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Pours an opaque caramel color with a thick tan head...nice lacing and reatention. Aroma is floral with tea-like hops...caramel maltiness...fruity...smells a bit like a barletwine. Flavor also has some caramel and earthy malt notes...spicy dry hoppiness...just a bit metallic. Mouthfeel is oily and the finish is bitter and dry...earthy.

Great nose where the buckwheat honey is really distinguishable and obvious, you can in fact easily tell each one apart from the other.

La Barberie Brune à la Mélasse (Aux Patriotes);Québec, Quebec, Canada;Brown Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;18th beer of the 2004 Montreal Mondiale. Dark brown.

La Barberie Brune à la Mélasse (Aux Patriotes);Québec, Quebec, Canada;Brown Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;A sweet little brown ale. I did not like it. Way too swet for me. Otherwise an OK beer for their lineup
La Barberie Brune à la Mélasse (Aux Patriotes);Québec, Quebec, Canada;Brown Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Stressing its sweetness, this round but quaffable malty body renders caramel and brown sugar hints, probably due to the molasses used...A slight earthiness joins the few almond skins in an attempt to refine the maltiness...Otherwise a simple brown ale...

Hyde Park Mary Ps Porter;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Porter;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Tap at Brewery. Color was deep brown, like a porter should be. Aroma was weak, not the strong tones of coffee, or smokey. Smooth and not heavy, which I liked. It makes for a very easy session beer. Flavor was better, but more like an ale than a porter. Not a strong beer for its class, but I have had far worse.
Hyde Park Mary Ps Porter;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Porter;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Not a lot of aroma. Was not as dark a color as I was expecting.

Hyde Park Chaos Dry Stout;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a dark red/brown color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that fell off at a moderate pace. Light stringy lace. The aroma had some roasty coffee beans up front, pretty bold and ended with some earthy hop dryness. The flavor was dry and roasty through the coffee beans. Super dry coffee aftertaste and finish. The feel was about medium bodied, maybe a touch under with a decent sessionability about it. Light carbonation. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, pretty nice dry stout, worthy of having again.
Hyde Park Chaos Dry Stout;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Sampled at Tap NY 2015, 4/25/15 This is a fairly simple stout, with dark brown pour and the dark/roast malt components you’d expect. It’s just fine, but there just isn’t a ton here.
Hyde Park Chaos Dry Stout;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Hyde Park Brewing Company;On draught at the brewpub. Arrived at the table black with a ring for a head. Very pleasant aroma of coffee and chocolate. The flavor is malt, lightly roasted with a bit of chocolate that is washed by some mild sourness.

Rock Bottom Chicago Terminal Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;Draft at Rock Bottom Chicago. Pours a deep brown/black with a tan head. The nose is a bit phenolic at first, then chocolate and charred roast. Light on the roast and softly hopped. On tasting, it is a pretty well rounded beer, tending again towards chocolate. Not overly sweet. Charcoal notes pervade, minimal hop flavor. Solid overall.
Rock Bottom Chicago Terminal Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at the brewpub on 6/20/07: Pours an opaque black with a frothy, wispy-lacing dark tan head. Aroma of roasted malts and dark chocolate.

Rock Bottom Chicago Terminal Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;Very dark brown, same as the Terminal Oatmeal Stout, actually. Very opaque. Smooth, not thin. Feels hand-pulled almost. Roasted quality and good subdued flavors. Well done. (on tap at brewpub, Labor Day weekend).
Rock Bottom Chicago Terminal Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;NOTA BENE: These combined ratings are for two different beers. Brown only around the edges, this black looking ale is topped with a creamy tan head that engages in thick lacing. The aroma (once the beer warmed) is mainly chocolate with some roasted malt and a splash of coffee. Some chewy dark caramel and a light touch of PNW bitterness are added to the flavor. Fairly dry finish. Pretty decent, quite stout-like. Rock Bottom Chicago, Chicago, IL Earlier Rating: 8/22/2005 Total Score: 2.9 More like a thin, watery stout than a porter. Roasted barley and milk chocolate in the nose and mouth with smattering of hop bitterness in the finish, this is one of the less impressive brews that I’ve had at the Chicago Rock Bottom, most often serving excellent drinks. But this one, some sweetness in the malt, tongue coating in the finish... I’ll past in the future. Rock Bottom Chicago, Chicago, IL
Rock Bottom Chicago Terminal Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at the brewpub, once again thanks Drewbeerme for sharing your beer.

Simple aroma of some roasted malt beans. Flavor was mainly chocolate and some coffee, some lingering bitterness as well. Decent brew, and like Duane said, similar to one that he made a while back.

John Harvards Pinstripe Porter;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Porter;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at JH. Pours a cloudy brown with just a small ring of white head. Aroma of roasted malt and roasted nuts, slight coffee presence. Flavor is similar with nice coffee and roasted nuts. Much better than I expected. It’s just a touch sweeter than I’d prefer, but I really don’t see why this beer gets such poor ratings... 7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)
John Harvards Pinstripe Porter;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Porter;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap at JH. Really ugly porter, too translucent and oddly murky at the same time. Aroma is actually pretty nice though, coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, the stuff that should be there. Flavor is less impressive with and odd sweetness and an odd coffee-grind bitterness that do not blend well together. Not sure why they keep churning out such a mess of a porter.
John Harvards Pinstripe Porter;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Porter;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at the Lake Grove location. Pours cola colored with a thin off-white head that lasted through the furst quarter of the glass and left partial lace. Very mild aroma of roasted malt and not much else. Thankfully, more flavorful than the aroma suggests with lightly roasted malt followed by some mild chocolate and tobacco. As the beer warmed, the tobacco flavor thankfully faded. Light bitterness at the finish.

John Harvards Pinstripe Porter;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Porter;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;April, 2004. Deep clear brown with a moka head. Pleasant choclate malt aroma. Thin short porter with no malts and no hops. Watery at the least.

Utenos Premium (Gold);Utena, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Utenos Alaus (Carlsberg);Nose is cereal - Cheerios actually. The appearance is pale yellow with a white headthat quickly dissipates leaving no lacing. The taste is unidimensional bitter - barely a hint of cereal. Body is medium, thin with soft carbonation. I was surprised that its initial nose was a handful of unsweetened Cheerios, the only redeeming quality in this beer. It quickly dissipated. Buy again? No.
Utenos Premium (Gold);Utena, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Utenos Alaus (Carlsberg);Why do they have to put it in a clear bottle? It looks good, smells unoffensive (fresh bottle), and tastes rather bland, par for the course.

Heavyweight Black Ocean;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Courtesy of footbalm. Medium brown, film for head. Smoke up front in the nose, hints of roast and coffee, slight sour twinge. Flavor on par, sour takes over a little bit in the finsh. Thin on the palate. Probably past it’s prime.

Heavyweight Black Ocean;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Capped 750 from Ty5592 - Thanks! Appears black at first, but raising it to the light shows a deep, brilliant mahogany red. A dense, beige head lasts to the final drop. Beautiful nose, mild baking chocolate, a bit of coffee, nicely roasty. Roasty flavor, chocolate, coffee, charcoal, some light nuttiness and a wisp of smoke. Light body that never feels thin, perfectly carbonated. Dreamy stuff... excellent.
Heavyweight Black Ocean;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Heavyweight Brewing Company;750 from HimerMan - thanks Brian!! I’ve been wanting to try this for some time and it doesn’t disappoint. A big dark amber pour, glistening with hints of ruby and topped by a lustrous head (but not a HW gusher!). Nice faintly chocolate aroma, which translates into the taste, capped off by some slightly dry qualities that give it a nice bitter finish. Fine stuff.

Heavyweight Regal Pale Ale;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Rated: 5/01/04 For about 8 or 9 months now, I’ve been wondering to myself if a beer from Heavyweight that I got on tap one night and couldn’t stop raving about for a few weeks actually existed. Everytime I checked the breweries website not a damn thing was mentioned about this beer. However, i kept my notes just in case it ever popped up. Well, after drinking this weekend and trying Heavyweights new Black Ocean, i decided to rate said Black ocean. Little did i know that heavyweight was brewing a whole series of beers to be available for only one time at one place. Sure enough i found the old Regal Pale Ale listed there. Well, enough rambling. This beer rocked. Potently hoppy, yet sweet, malty and earthy, with a killer refreshing finish. Big white head, pungent hop aroma. Friggin delicious. And its never to be brewed again. Damn.
Heavyweight Pegalina Pale Ale;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;IPA - Belgian;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Draft at Blind Tiger. Great IPA. Well-balanced and fruity. Spicey aroma. Complex refreshing body and a nice average long hoppy finish. A good IPA.
Heavyweight Pegalina Pale Ale;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;IPA - Belgian;Heavyweight Brewing Company;07.10.04 tap @ HW open house. Orangey gold color. Seemed quite young to me, others at the tasting agreed. Nice malt backing makes it recognizably Heavyweight. Bready and sweet but with a harshly sharp, dry fresh hop bite. A welcome hoppiness, but too harsh it seemed for the type of hops used. Alas, the potential for this beer was evident and six weeks later it sounds like the beer has mellowed quite a bit.
Heavyweight Pegalina Pale Ale;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;IPA - Belgian;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Draft. Pours dark straw with medium head. Aroma of malt, fruit, hops. Tastes malty, with hops, slight fruit, and slight corn chips. Medium palate with a malt/hop/fruit/limey corn chip finish that was slightly dry. Unique.
Heavyweight Pegalina Pale Ale;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;IPA - Belgian;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Draft it the Grey Lodge in Philly. Ok Beer. Was a little to sweet (honey?) for me. Had a hop and it had a lot that I didn’t care for.
Heavyweight Pegalina Pale Ale;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;IPA - Belgian;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Not your typical American micro I.P.A. My nose was greeted by the scent of wet hops from this golden ale. Peglina’s German, British and American ingredients blend well together. This beer reminds me of a super hoppy Octoberfest beer.
Heavyweight Pegalina Pale Ale;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;IPA - Belgian;Heavyweight Brewing Company;On draft at the Grey Lodge. Modest hop bouquet, not much head, some lacing. Thought I was signing up for a hop monster, but instead this is a mild and mellow pale ale, nice hint of pepper in the finish.
Heavyweight Pegalina Pale Ale;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;IPA - Belgian;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Draught at Spuyten. Deer clear orange hue with a small off-white head. Interesting aroma with some nutty part I can’t put my finger on. Supposedly this is made with rye? It blended pretty well (hop rod rye anyone?) although very accessible. Hops are orangey and earthy which gives an english feel. Mouthfeel is smooth, rather mouth-filling and displaying lower than average effervescence. Nice malt bill (rye, cereals, caramel), Spicy peppery and orangey finish. I like it!
Heavyweight Pegalina Pale Ale;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;IPA - Belgian;Heavyweight Brewing Company;(draft) Clear mahogany body with beige head. Aroma is mild sweet, peppery, caramel, some earthy. Taste is medium sweet, caramel, port, earthy, pepper. Low carbonated, medium body, sticky. Not like any pale ale that I have ever had.
Heavyweight Pegalina Pale Ale;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;IPA - Belgian;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Draft at Monks... This was a very interesting, IPA? Whoa... Poured a dark reddish caramel color, medium sized off white head, and nice lacing. Aroma of yeast, light citrus, and tropical fruits. Interesting flavors going on in the taste. It tasted somewhat sweet, citrus (orange peel), some pepper, a little alcohol, and finally finishing a little roasty. Light carbonation. This tasted very Belgian to me, hops were not all that pronounced.
Heavyweight Pegalina Pale Ale;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;IPA - Belgian;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Amber appearance with an average head. Aroma had a cereal-like quality that reminded me of grapenut flakes. A maltier IPA with a butterscotch flavor. Finished smooth with little hint of the 7% abv. On tap at Max’s in Baltimore.
Rock Bottom San Diego Cross Jack Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom San Diego;Draft at the brewpub and a growler at home.

Rock Bottom San Diego Cross Jack Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom San Diego;Draught at brewery. Better than expected honestly.

Normal hefe aroma and flavour of citrus and spice. Very refreshing.
Rock Bottom San Diego Cross Jack Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom San Diego;On tap at brewery. Dull, straw gold in color.

Rock Bottom San Diego Cross Jack Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom San Diego;Board just sed hefe. Very sheaty aroma, lots of banana in the flavor, but the banana and wheat are just right. A pretty good finish. Quite pleasantly surprised.
Rock Bottom San Diego Cross Jack Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom San Diego;My favourite of the beer they had on tap while we were there.

Rock Bottom San Diego Cross Jack Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom San Diego;Draft: Called just Hefeweizen. Golden orange color, good carbonation. Nose of toasted wheat, light banana and some clove. The flavor has a good level of hallertau hops, creamy wheat body and a bit of off-notes in the finish and light overall compared to the originals but this is decent. Perhaps less wheat ratio in the grist.
Rock Bottom San Diego Cross Jack Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom San Diego;Citris and banana aroma. Pours a cloudy yellow, thin head. Yeast and banana flavours. Could have used some more sourness. Still, you could proabably pound back alot of these bad boys.

Spicey nose with lemon and yeast notes. Creamy body, nice. Flavours of citrus, coriander and yeast. Seemed to have a bit of Belgian character. Tasty, though.

Thüringer Premium Pils;Gotha, Thuringia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Gotha (Oettinger);Bought this one at a store in Lima Peru, in a single can. They had tall cans and shorties. Very easy to drink beer. Not heavy, barley flavor is clear, and hopped up lightly. The palate is not very deep and it does not have too much more going on for it. It is what it is, a good clean pilsener. I could enjoy quite a few of these over the local peru blends.

Cabezon Kristall Weizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Cabezon Brewing Company;Bottle, acquired on a rafting trip to Santa Fe. Rating taken from notes i’ve been too busy to input, original drinking date was probably May of 2005. Pours with a small fizzy white diminishing head. Lacing is spare, body is sparkling and a very pale yellow color. Aroma is lightly malty, lightly hoppy of hay, grass, celery, orange, and lime. Lightly yeasty and hints of soap and chalk. Light in body with a thin texture and average carbonation with a metallic finish. Flavor is short in duration, light to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Terrible. Bad metallic aftertaste. It’s more like a yucky pils. I hate to admit it but I can’t finish this s$%^.
Cabezon Kristall Weizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Cabezon Brewing Company;leave it to mike to find the dusty bottles, in which a 6pack costs $1.99. wow. this tasted like the ocean. some grass and hay flavors and aromas, as well as a decent amount of skunk.
Cabezon Kristall Weizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Cabezon Brewing Company;Damn glad to find this dusty bottled beer. Its got a copper color to it with a small head. Aroma is of fresley cut weeds and skunky malts. Tastes like salt water with maybe some caramel dipped in it.
Cabezon Kristall Weizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Cabezon Brewing Company;Medium gold hue with light orange edges. Some very small particles. Visible carbonation. Medium, creamy, white head is short lived. Aromas of hair in a fan motor, corn, butter, salt, hay and light grains. Lightly sweet, lightly acidic flavor. Very lightly sweet finish. Not much flavor outside of some corn and hay, thankfully. Some of the off-flavors do come through in the finish though. Medium-light body, watery texture, lively carbonation.
Cabezon Kristall Weizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Cabezon Brewing Company;Don’t you need to use a weizen yeast to produce a Kristall weizen? Pours a light straw with a fizzy head. Citrusy aromas. Diacetyl in a weizen? Finishes like Alka seltzer. This is just terrible.
Cabezon Kristall Weizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Cabezon Brewing Company;Clear pale-yellow body with mild carbonation and loose soapy white head that mostly faded away. Aroma of citrusy/banana esters, touch of clove, wheat and diacetyl. Grainy, cereal flavor. Also estery, slightly nutty, considerably sweet, medium acidity, and a hint of hop bitterness. Tart, thin eviscerated body. Sweet, cloying cereal tartness dominates and really hurts.
Cabezon Kristall Weizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Cabezon Brewing Company;As said in previous rating, this is one of those fridge cleaners where you drink this to make room for other better beers, as I was saying I agree, this is right up there with the worst wheat beers I have ever had. Stale wheat chex...indeed

Aroma of jelly bean with a hint of banana esters, honey dew and some golden grain malt with wheat. Taste is quite sweet with flavors mostly of mellon, some candi sugar, honey and golden grain malt. Finish is quite sweet with a lingering jelly bean and mellon aftertaste.
Great Dane Watermelon Wheat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Just had this on tap last night at the downtown Dane: Pours a bright hazey orange colour with a big bouqet of flowers, fruit and spices. Watermelon, raspberries other berry fruit. Taste was a little too much. Like really too much. Way too sweet for me. And i guess this makes sense to a point, watermelon could be a pretty appealing taste, but it just wasn’t doing it for me. Sorry. Take it easy on the fruit mista!
Great Dane Watermelon Wheat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub on 6/22/07: Pours a murky pinkish orange with a thin wispy white head.

Aroma, watermelon, more specifically, watermelon jolly ranchers. Flavor, tastes like a wine cooler, candy, watery. Not very good, but not horrible.
Great Dane Watermelon Wheat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at GD - Madison. Poured hazy pink with a short, creamy head. Aroma was of freshly-sliced watermelons with some tangy wheat lurking way in the background. The flavor had fresh, sweet watermelon upfront with tangy wheat and mild spices coming through about halfway.. spritzy watermelon again at the finish. Lighter-bodied with a decent flow to it.. not bad.
Great Dane Watermelon Wheat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"On tap at the brewpub. Odd aroma like bread soaked in cough syrup; thin pinkish head sits atop lovely, dainty, clear rosy liquid; Flavor overly sweet like a Jolly Rancher; wheat and watermelon flavors do not mesh well, though the wheat base -- when it can be discerned -- is this beer’s primary redeeming feature. Bartender claims the head brewers don’t even like it but they keep making it because of its improbable popularity; the pub is, after all, in a student area, and one speculates the co-eds need something they can tolerate while their meathead boyfriends drink the more substantial stuff. A rare miss from an otherwise high-quality brewpub."
Great Dane Watermelon Wheat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Hazy light pink, like grapefruit juice, with a thin, creamy head that leaves some nice lacing as it goes. Smells like strawberry shortcake, watermelon, yeast and clover. Flavor is thin watermelons, like a diet Snapple. Mild sweetness, easy going.
Swans India Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Swans Brewpub;Tasted on tap at Swans Brewpub. Excellent IPA. His hoppiness without overpowering
Swans India Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Swans Brewpub;Tap at the brewpub. Clear gold pour with a small soapy white head. Citrus and pine, assertive hops. Good.
Swans India Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Swans Brewpub;Bomber, as Swans India Pale Ale. Clear lighter orange copper, fine off-white foam settles and mostly lasts. Aroma is sweet fruity and citric. Taste is mostly lightly bitter forest fruity, lots of citrus, lightly sweet lean pale malt behind. Average carbonation, light-medium bodied, well hopped. Refreshing and easy to quaff but still: NFL (Not For Lagerboys)
Swans India Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Swans Brewpub;"Sweet nose made me think of apple juice. Bready and crackery malt flavors, along with a yeasty aspect in the finish. Clean bitterness. Subdued hop flavors and aromas left me wanting more. Seems like this IPA leans more toward the British style, but I don’t think that’s what they were going for as they tout this beer as having ""citrus, pine and fruit."" I only got herbs, flowers, grass and a weak citrus note. Regardless, overall it was OK, it just lacked some vibrancy and charisma."
Swans India Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Swans Brewpub;On tap at Swans. Great aroma! Strong with pine. Very nice. Gets a bit cloying by the end, with how sweet it is. Bitter, resinous taste.

Swans India Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Swans Brewpub;Verbatim from notes 16JUL11 Golden ale with brilliant clarity and no head. No foam. Plenty of citric hps and just a hint of malt. Not special but not bad at all. Plenty of late addition hops give this a good flavor, but doesn’t really pack much bitterness. slick finish. Serving type: on-tap 08-04-2011
Swans India Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Swans Brewpub;Honey color, big foamy head that fades fast. Aroma is all pine and lemon, not very pleasant. Flavor is terribly sweet with some piney hop finish. Thick and icky.
Turtle Mountain C3 IPA;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;ReRate-Man o man, what a dissapointment this day was when i revisited this beer. The beer has suffered from a case of the diacytl. The beer had all the possibilities to be a great IPA, modeled after SNCA. Unfortunately, TMBC suffers from lack of quality-control and this beer took a dive for the worse. It was the most buttery beer of the night and its really a shame since this beer is usually so good. please TMBC, hear this message and clean up your brewery so you can produce beers without diacytl. tap at brewery-pours a nice orange hue with minimal head. high alpha citrus aroma of grapefruit, pinneapple, and tangerine. medium body-citrus hop and dry piney finish-you can tell this has all 3 of the hops-cascade pineyness, centennial citrus notes and that chinook hop dryness on the finish. There are alot of crystal malts here actually, but somewhat hard to detect due to the wallop of hops (no reference to the brew by Victory). I love the dryness of this finish. Great IPA! first rating, 3.9
Turtle Mountain C3 IPA;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Poours a lite amber with hues of orange. Nose of centtenial hops. An overwhelming amount of grapefruit aromas but only for most. This a homebrewers type of IPA,... Hop Juice! You can actually chew the hoppiness of this brew. THERE WAS A LAYER GREEN HOP RESIN AT THE BOTTOM OF MY 34 OZ. GLASS!
Turtle Mountain C3 IPA;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Original rating, 8,4,8,4,17: Orange-copper body and slim off-white draught head. Lighter color than previous IPAs from this brewery. Citrusy hops in the nose from dry hopping with Cascade plus some wood and fruity malts. Crisp grapefruit and woody flavor. Medium body has a less malty texture than other Turtle IPAs. This is another great IPA from Turtle Mountain. Very stylish and my favorite to date. After sampling at least 3 separate batches, consistency is a big problem with this beer. The most recent sampling was very heavy in diacetyl and very astringent to the point of being difficult to drink.

Bierhäus Cult Helles;Wien, Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Bierhäus Cult;Cloudy pale amber brew with a malt aroma. Very smooth and mellow flavour with some bitterness increasing in the aftertaste. Not interesting, just very drinkable. (Draught at Brauhäus Cult, Vienna)
Bierhäus Cult Schnitt;Wien, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Bierhäus Cult;A deep brown, malty, tasty beer with a pronounced toastiness in all departments. Fairly dry and full in body, this is a fairly complex beer. (Draught at Brauhäus Cult, Vienna)
Dombräu Styria Dunkl;Graz, Austria;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dombräu;03/01 Draught at the brewpub. Clear brown body with medium brownish head. Very pleasant, sourish aroma, some roasted caramel with a bit of dark fruits. Sweetish flavor, fruity and a bit of chocolate also, as such very pleasant. Also, quite full bodied with not too much carbonation. Finish is great, too, sweet sugary caramel with some fruits. Delicious, I think the best Dunkel I’ve tried, I regret that didn’t take a bottle for home, which is probably even better.
Dombräu Styria Dunkl;Graz, Austria;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dombräu;Thick foamy beige head tops the opaque dark brown body. Again a really soft flavoured, perhaps too much so austrian dunkel. Appealing juicy grape and berry tones mount over the earthy and leafy pretense, but it’s all down behind the walls. Nevertheless, a dry, softly carbonated and foamy, pleasant drink.
Dombräu Styria Dunkl;Graz, Austria;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dombräu;Bottle (5.2%),, bought at the brewpub, which seems to have expired 20 days ago. Wonderful. Just wonderful. Looked impressive. An opaque very dark brown/almost black body, with a big-huge fluffy tan head. that collapsed leaving plentiful lacing. Interesting nose... raisins, coffee, dark chocolate. Coffee and chicory dominate the taste, which is soft and pleaant, some roastiness in the aftertaste. Faint, faint malt. The body, despite being dominated by some persistent and very pronounced flavors, is relatively light in truth. The bottle calls it a Schwarzbier (which, after tasting it, I’m quite willing to believe, as it’s more dry than sweet, and the profile is a bit different from an ordinary Dunkel), and says it contains rye (hmmm). Nice and interesting. Bottle conditioning must’ve done wonders for this one.
Dombräu Styria Dunkl;Graz, Austria;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dombräu;Draught at the brewpub Fresh, light fruity aroma, light roasty. Creamy, light brown head. Quite hazy, nutbrown color. Fresh, light fruity and light malty. Light roasty, dry finish. For me a bit to bitter. Unspectacular

Dombräu Styria Dunkl;Graz, Austria;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Dombräu;Dark brown beer, fairly hazy, with a caramel nose. Sweetish malt, toasted malt and some hop and bitterness combine to give this beer a complex and satisfying taste. (Draught at Dombräu, Graz)
Dombräu Helles Naturtrüb;Graz, Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Dombräu;03/01 Draught at the brewpub. Poured murky golden body with medium white head. Sourish unpasteurized aroma, with nice fruitiness (citrus, orange, honey), very pleasant. Flavor is sweetish, quite tasty and nice although thin bodied. Long, nice fruity finish. Quite heavenly after those boring pale lagers and beer like things those days!
Dombräu Helles Naturtrüb;Graz, Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Dombräu;Extremely foamy, soft cloudy pale gold. Rounded malt flavours, fully cerealic, fresh and not too sweet. Sandy hop nuances capture the finish while floral notes and limited bitterness are unagressive and softly caressing. Terrific mouthfeel, rich, foamy, refreshing. Excellent example!
Dombräu Helles Naturtrüb;Graz, Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Dombräu;"0.5l, 5.2%, bottle conditioned (huge amount of yeast in the bottom of the bottle), 8 days after it ""expired"". Interesting. Poured a hazy light apricot colour, big thick white head that went at a medium pace. The nose is distinctly yeasty (not terribly pleasant) with faint notes of hops. A nice hoppiness, a pleasant maltiness (honey-like maybe) and a stale, unimpressive yeastiness that kinda ruins all that. Some lemoniness and a fine mouthfeel. Tastes light, feels heavy on the stomach. Odd, I know. Didn’t impress me much. This isn’t fresh (and this style seems to benefit from that), and I’ll definitely try it draught next time. It shows promise, but I didn’t like it nearly as much as the bottled Dunkel (and that was almost a month past its expiry date)."

Dombräu Weizen Hefetrüb;Graz, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dombräu;Cloudy deep gold. Exotic meringue-like cover. They can’t be blamed for their looks those Dombraus. Well done fresh yeast emanations propose clove, nutmeg, dirty leaves.. All culminating into an interesting sweetness at low levels. It’s all about the yeast this one, though the wheat offers a nice crisp support. Ultimately, not that refreshing though, slightly juicy, but leaving an unripe banana feel with a certain astringency.
Dombräu Weizen Hefetrüb;Graz, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dombräu;Draught at the brewpub. -cloudy dark honey coloured, lasting medium white head, nice fruity aroma with lemon, banana and slight apricot flavor, slight fruity acidic and bitter finish

Dombräu Weizen Hefetrüb;Graz, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dombräu;Typical of the German style, this is a full, cloudy, yellowy brew with the usual bubblegum and banana flavours and a fairly bitter aftertaste with full-on bubblegum. Not my choice of beer but well brewed. (Draught at Dombräu, Graz)

Khean W Indied;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Khean;Reading Beer Fest, Gravity. I’m a bit miffed at this one - my drinking partner, a scooper from Plymouth whose name I can’t remember, said it was a bit dodgy, and he suspected it was a festival mix. I agree, though my feeling is that it was a mix of stale and fresh beer of the same abv - maybe Leg Spinner. Whatever - it’s a fairly standard bitter of no character. Strangely flat yet green. I’ll be avoiding Khean beers in future.

Papago Six Shooter Imperial Wheat Pale Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Papago Brewing;Another winner from Papago. Not like your normal wheat beer. This one is a hopheads delight. Six different hops in it and they even have the beer run through fresh hops right before serving.

Papago Six Shooter Imperial Wheat Pale Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Papago Brewing;On-tap at the brewpub: After finally deciding after much discussion with the Staff and Gusler, I decided to start the evening with this brew. It was still early evening and pretty hot at the time and I didn’t want to start off with the heavy stuff. But just after I ordered it I then saw the 7.6%. Whoa nelly, here we go! Color is a clear bright slightly pale gold, nice firm white head thats small and compact, lacing in sheets the whole way down. Aroma is wheaty sweet, sticky, buttery, crisp, with a nudge of mild floral hops underneath. Taste is all malts, and a wonderful supply of them, nice sticky sweetness of wheat and chewy malts that has unique crispness at the edge of every sip. Quite tasty. Hops add some floral spice nearer the finish but more sweetness wipes the palate clean before the finish drips away clean and malty. Feel is nearly full, well rounded and super clean and lightly buttery smooth, with an edgy zip of hops in the middling finish and ends overall dully sweet and fruity. Gone in no time and making another choice was soon to be had as this was an amazingly fine wheat ale to consume. Very well crafted and super yummy.
Papago Six Shooter Imperial Wheat Pale Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Papago Brewing;"Clear golden body with white head. Aroma is sweet, honey, some wheat. Taste is sweet, wheat, some herbal bitterness, finishing sweet alcohol. Medium-full, some sticky. Not as ""heavy"" as I2PAs, but the refreshing quality that a wheat should have is missing as a result of the ""Imperial""-ness."
Papago Six Shooter Imperial Wheat Pale Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Papago Brewing;Nice American hop aroma, lots of citrus and piney notes. Flavor is sweet, lots of malt and wheat flavor, with a nice mix of hops and alcohol in there. Pretty full-bodied. Far from your typical American wheat beer, more like an IPA that happens to have wheat in it.
Papago Six Shooter Imperial Wheat Pale Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Papago Brewing;A remarkable complex beer. Delictable aroma of wheat, hops, and some spicy notes. Flavor is well balanced, smooth flavor with the bitterness well contained. The aftertaste is a little dissapointing. A little bland maybe too dry, or maybe it was just my palate at the time. Still a very well balanced thirst quencher. Seek it out if you are at Papago.
Papago Six Shooter Imperial Wheat Pale Ale;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Papago Brewing;"Draught @ Papago This is a new creation from Ron the master brewer, and one I’ve been eagerly awaiting since he told me about it, “Woo Hoo” it here! The beer fresh from the tap pours a translucent gold with a majestic bright white heat that is creamy in texture; the lace forms a nice sheet upon the glass. Nose has a nice mild hop floral aroma, backed my sweet malt and a touch of yeast, strikingly crisp and fresh with the start lightly sweet and the wheat profile pleasant, the top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops magnificent in their spiciness, quite dry after taste, with the dry hopping a nice touch, a great summertime beer for us desert rats, as the thermometer is hitting the century mark now and will stay that way till the end of October."

Well, I hate wasting beer so I put it away anyway. Pretty much standard issue beer in appearance, aroma and taste. Coulda swore this was a light lager. Your friends & family who are familiar with the macro brews will be pleased with this. As said by others, at least you’re spending money at a brewpub instead of throwing it at one of the big guys.

Front Street Swing Cream Ale;Davenport, Iowa, United States;Cream Ale;Front Street Brewery (IA);On tap at the ballpark. Light golden in color with a phenomenal head retention. All-malt cream ale that beats the hell out of drinking Miller Lite with that bag of peanuts. Light and refreshing. Like everything the Davenport Swing is doing, it is first class that they provide a locally made beer to serve to the fans of this Single-A team. I was amazed that a thick head remained until the last sip.
Front Street Swing Cream Ale;Davenport, Iowa, United States;Cream Ale;Front Street Brewery (IA);Lite yellow color and I don’t remember there being much head or lacing. It was better than other cream ale but, I don’t like cream ale so most people wouldn’t like it.

Goes down smooth and easy - good stuff!
Front Street Cherry Ale;Davenport, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Front Street Brewery (IA);On tap, poured into a 4oz sampler.

Front Street Cherry Ale;Davenport, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Front Street Brewery (IA);I wasn’t impressed by this brew. Everything about tasted fake. I got the cherries in the aroma and flavor but it seemed more like cough medicine cherry flavor.

Front Street Bucktown Stout;Davenport, Iowa, United States;Stout - Dry;Front Street Brewery (IA);Draught at the brew-pub The beer pours basically black with a thin tan head that is pretty well retained and leaves not much lacing on the glass. The aroma is nutty, with plenty of roast and dark chocolate. The aroma has a little bit of banana in there that isn’t totally out of place. The bouquet is mild, but what is there is very pleasant. The flavor of the beer is roasty, perhaps a little too liberal with the roast, but the nuttiness and the dark chocolate step up to provide a little balance there. Again a little bit of banana in the flavor that just isn’t bad no matter how much I want to think it is. It’d certainly get docked for this in a BJCP contest, but the beer is tasty so I’m not really going to whine about it.

Brownings Louis XVI Guillotine ESB;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brownings Brewery;Bottle (holy crap - don’t know how this bottle popped up - Parti-pak is the place for retired beers). Weedy grass and toffee malt aroma. Amber with small head. Mildly sweet toffee malt and dry grass flavor. Has aged incredibly well.
Brownings Louis XVI Guillotine ESB;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brownings Brewery;Bottle: Pours slightly hazed orange-amber with a small beige head.

Way out of date bottle......so....it’s a bit worse for wear....still well carbonated and fruity.... A little sweet for the style
Brownings Louis XVI Guillotine ESB;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brownings Brewery;Gold pour with white head and lace. Earthy/perfumey hops and sweet malt aroma. Perfume, sweet malt, and a light bitter finish. A very sweet esb. A bit thin and fizzy.

Brownings Louis XVI Guillotine ESB;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brownings Brewery;Aroma of citrus hops, grass and light caramel. Appearance is rusty gold with white head. Flavor matches the nose, but pretty watered down. Palate is creamy. More like a Pale Ale, and didn’t remind me of an ESB at all.
Brownings Louis XVI Guillotine ESB;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brownings Brewery;English malty nose but well balanced. Malty and bitter and full. Super bitter finish.

Brownings Louis XVI Guillotine ESB;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brownings Brewery;Hazy golden hue with a huge fluffy head and clinging lace in my no-nik pint glass. The aroma has notes of dusty and biscuity malts, some caramel, herbal hops, hint of apple cider and pear, metallic and minerally. The taste has a sharp acidity and moderate hop bitterness before the pale and caramel malt are noticed. Light peppery spice and peat before a metallic finish. The mouth feel is lively (perhaps too much for the style) and a tad thin-bodied. Meh, just very average and also appears to be turning due to the initial high acidity.
Brownings Louis XVI Guillotine ESB;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brownings Brewery;22 oz bottle A decent enough bitter, this was a gift from a friend. I have never been blown away by Browning’s but they do just well enough to hold out promise that eventually they might make a breakthrough. However unlikely that seems they are at least one of the best breweries in Kentucky (for what that is worth). Given the choice between visiting them and visiting Bluegrass I may opt to go downtown. Aroma / Appearance - The sticky sheet of lacing mixed with a golden mostly transparent body lively with carbonation. Cedar wood shavings, freshly brewed iced tea, and some other light aspects make it easy on the senses. Flavor / Palate - Oak chips, shavings of medium grade chocolate, and peat moss wash quickly across the tongue seeking refuge in the throat. Lightly hopped it sits gently on the back of the palate before fading. I’m not usually a big fan of ESBs but this makes a nice change of pace from bigger styles.
Brownings Red Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brownings Brewery;Draft - more golden in color than red. Nice malty sweetness. Nice safe beer - I wish they were more bold, but good!
Brownings Weizenbock;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Brownings Brewery;Draft - this beer is the exact color of a Kraft caramel. It has a very yeasty flavor. Nice!

Brownings Oatmeal Stout;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Brownings Brewery;Draught. Pours brown. The aroma is sweet, almost cola-like with hints at oats. Not much bitterness or roast is present on this one. I found the mouthfeel to be light for a stout. Flavors of caramel and chocolate are present with a richly sweet finish. This is a decent, fairly creamy beer. There just isn’t much to it.

Aroma is lightly bready, toasted malt, and grainy. Taste is bready, crackers, with a slightly harsh grainy/husky finish. Overall a very drinkable and enjoyable Octoberfest, but it wish it had a slightly more rounded palate, with a little more sweetness and less harsh graininess. Ar 7 Ap 4 Fl 7 Mf 4 Ov 15 = 3.7 10/05/09 -On tap at Liquor Barn. Pours amber, dark oragne with a mostly receding off-white head.

Electric Brewing OK Ale;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;Tap at DE. Damn another ho hum pale. Light malt, cereal, bready notes, butter. Same flavors. Not really all so great. Good view of the ASU staduim though.
Electric Brewing OK Ale;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;Poured up on tap at Dave’s Electric brewpub with clear copper body and near white head. The aroma seems malty, a bit roasty with malts and a bit earthy with a sense of citrus way off in the background. The tast begins pretty neutral and then picks up a mild level of roasted malts. To midway spicy hops come to the surface and are then joined by earthy hops into the finish. Nice spicy, earthy amber.
Electric Brewing OK Ale;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;Clear amber color/ beige head. Mild, but fresh floral, ganja bud aromas. Medium bodied. Decent flavors of lightly sweet, grainy caramel malt, with a nicely bitter hoppy finish--not bad--
Electric Brewing OK Ale;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;Bottle thanks to Bavarian Purity, great trader! Smell is quite candy sweet, it alarms me that this may be quite strong. No sign of visible CO2. Hazy brownish yellow. Fairly flat on the palate. Fruity at times. Does not seem to show alot of alky even tho this is 7%. Goes down way too easy. Starting to get some leather in there er somethin. Quite rich and somewhat thick on the palate. As session continues, becomes more oppressive. Don’t really think this belongs inthe APA style. Do I sense a little tartness inthere? Finish is flat and smooth. Tastes like it was aged and served on cask.
Electric Brewing OK Ale;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;on tap at the tempe pub 12/27/2009. clear gold pour with a white head which leaves a bunch of lacy foam on the glass. it smells of orange, mild pine, spiciness, malt sweetness, florals and some skunky nobles... quite soapy and floral. the flavor is pretty much the same... malty yet very dry and crisp on the palate. not a whole bunch going on but there is nothing else wrong with it. it pairs very well with spicy food and conversation... 6/3/5/3/13/3.0
Electric Brewing OK Ale;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;Enjoyed on tap at the new Tempe brewpub location. Poured a light amber color with a slight haze. Very thin head. Bright citrus on the nose. Palate has a hop focus and citrus zest, but still well within a basic amber ale category (not a hoppy IPA). Easy drinking but nothing inspiring about the beer.
Electric Brewing OK Ale;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;Bottle. Pours hazy amber with a one finger beige head that results in spotty lacing. The nose is caramel malt and earthy hops. The taste is caramel, grain and light citrus hops. Medium bodied. Wasn’t sure what to expect on this one but it’s not bad.
Electric Brewing OK Ale;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;A vigorous pour produces a fat-one-finger thick, light tan colored head. The beer is a hazy amber color that shows a bit of a copper hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells of spicy hop and stale malt. It almost has a cinnamon note to it that goes well with the predominant caramel notes. A very light aroma compared to most beers. Sweet and caramelized up front, the beer finishes with an herbal hop flavor as well as a lightly biting bitterness. There is a certain spiciness running through the flavor profile here, it is almost like black pepper, with even a bit of a wood-like note to it. This has a light body to it, yet has a touch of heft to it that just clings to the palate. Not a bad beer, just not all that great either. Tastes a bit like a standard Amber ale.
Electric Brewing OK Ale;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;Pours a dark orange-brown (like a strong tea) with a creamy, pitted, beige head that deposits wispy lace on the glass. The nose is more like an ESB than an APA: dry, biscuity malt with earthy hops in the background. Light to medium-bodied and creamy on the tongue, transitioning to a bitter, lightly salty, and somewhat metallic finish. Again, the flavor is more like a well-hopped ESB than an APA, but I like ESBs. This is a solid session brew from the guys in Bisbee.
Electric Brewing OK Ale;Bisbee, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dave's Electric Brewing Co.;Pours a medium hazy amber collor with a foamy light tan head. Aroma is sweet hops and caramel, with some citrus. Flavor is similar, but somewhat weak. Finish is slightly bitter and watery, but quenching. As the name states, OK

Brownings Dunkelweizen;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brownings Brewery;Draft at the 2005 Knoxville Brewer’s Jam. A nice brown color in the glass with a small tan head. Smells of raisins and fruits, with very light malts noted. The flavor was a reasonable hop and malt mix but need just a little more. Smooth light to medium body.
Brownings Dunkelweizen;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brownings Brewery;Draft - coudy and about the color of a brown ale. Sweet and malty. I’d like more umph, though.
Big Sheep Shepherds Ruin;Bideford, Devon, England;Strong Ale - English;Country Life Brewery;"Bright bottled at Reading Beer Festival. When sampled at the festival my notes were ""Dark amber strong ale. Sweet and fruity with a late tang. Score 3.3"" It survived the journey home very well. There’s little condition, but it tastes fresh. There’s a bland fruity sweetness followed by a good bitter finish, mostly earthy, though with a slight orange citric tang.

Lacks character this one, but it drinks easily. Might need some food to shine. 150610

Portsmouth Oatmeal Stout;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Portsmouth Brewery;Polished, roasty aroma. Chocolates, brandy cherries, coffee, more. Graham cracker maltiness and sarsaparilla bittersweetness make up a simple, top-heavy flavor. Mouthfeel is round and delicate, lacking in a certain pillowy depth that characterizes better examples.

Nice nose reminding me of a chill spring night, with honey, heather and other flowers. Sweet, honeyish, heathery flavor, almost syrupy texture. A bit on the warming side. Alcohol, heather and honey in the finish. A nice mead, but a bit too syrupy. Maybe it would work nice as an after dinner drink. (090514)

Elmwood Pale Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Elmwood Brewing Company;Draught at the 2006 Iowa City Brew Fest. Clear yellow-orange color with white head that left a nice lace on the glass. Attractive flowery hop aroma and flavor well balanced by a buttery caramel, malty cereal grain note that lingers.
Elmwood Pale Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Elmwood Brewing Company;Explodes out of bottle with a 5+ finger head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Cloudy (??) amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Piney, cidery nose. Starts slightly sweet but a cidery, hoppy flavor is right there. Limited hoppy aftertaste, different from any pale I have had. 12 oz bottle from Friar Tuck’s Peoria, Il.
Elmwood Pale Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Elmwood Brewing Company;Usually when I go to the store I buy beer that gets good ratings. This time I thought what the hell, why not try a local beer. This must have angered the rate beer gods. This was disgusting. Terribly balanced, horrible aroma. The bottle sprayed when I opened it. Overbearing metallic, citris after taste. Don’t even bother, this is terrible. Not even worth complete sentances.
Elmwood Pale Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Elmwood Brewing Company;In the bottle. Light amber color with a fluffy oatmeal-colored head. A medium fragrant hoppy citrus aroma, but otherwise, not very memorable. Medicinal taste. Hops that were neither subtle nor balanced- mild grapefruit. Finishes with a sweet pungent aftertaste. Nowhere nearly as bad as my last Elmwood which was contaminated and exploded out of the bottle and into the sink.
Elmwood Pale Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Elmwood Brewing Company;Medium amber colored body with a light off white head. The aroma is colby cheese with some light oranges and grass. There is also some moldy old cellar. The taste has some light hay and wood. There is also a hint of grapefruit, but it is very subtle. There is also some old moldy socks and a little bread. This is not as bad as their other offereings, but lame. Again, why are they bottling this?
Elmwood Pale Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Elmwood Brewing Company;"I don’t understand what color is this supposed to suggest? It looks jaundiced. It could be red, pink, brown, copper, orange...? Pouring fresh out of the bottle (purchased cold), the beer produced absolutely no head other than some white slime on the surface. Fruity, sanitary and metallic aroma. The flavor is overpowered by fizziness, though there’s a strange hint of tart caramel(?). Anyway, some intrusive flavors for a pale ale yet not undrinkable by any means. The most off-putting aspect to this beer is its extreme carbonation. They cloud the color, and make its appearance murky and muddy. This is not surprising after having just read an interview with its maker. Apparently he liked going out to bars and drinking American domestics, then they ordered a Killians Irish Red. Well, here’s the American entrepreneurial spirit for you. Once they tasted Killian’s, they realized that beer is actually something entirely removed from the domestic lagers they were raised on, they decided to make their own, instead of learning to apprecreciate the craft. It’s like they got the idea ""Let’s take the domestics we know, and make ’em taste like Killians,"" instead of searching for the roots of what a beer should really taste like. It actually reminded me of Killian’s upon first taste. ""Look, guys, we can do it, too!"" But with a commercial carbonation, and no intimation of depth or understanding of the art in its production. They seem to have settled for a mediocre role-model to best. And they do best Killians, in flavor. This pale ale features a strange flavor that (although it may be too strong for many some tastes) somehow incorporates a sweetness and all of the good flavors that should be in every beer. Somehow, it becomes a bit overpowering. And. unfortunately, everything else is off. I will try their other brews, despite obviously being the work of perennial amatuers. And I hate fizzy heads."
Elmwood Pale Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Elmwood Brewing Company;"Bottled. #6 of 31 US Beers for <a href=""http://www.americanbeermonth.com"">American Beer Month. O-o-o-kay, a gusher when I open the bottle. Not a good start, but let’s remember this sat in my hot car for a few hours. Orangeish, slightly cloudy body, very fizzy head that suggests bacteria. But no, contamination isn’t the problem. It’s just really off style with off flavors. Metallic taste; what, are they suing aluminum brewpots? Even a bit of bile. Folks, I want to support local brewers as much as possible, especially in the BMC wasteland that is downstate Illinois, but this is not something I can get behind."
Elmwood Pale Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Elmwood Brewing Company;Awful-just poured a second bottle. Remember that science experiment in eigth grade where you mix vinegar and baking powder? I’ve never seen anything like it. Took the cap off and there was a steady flow of head with the bottle standing straight up!!! It kept going until a third of the bottle was empty. Do not waste your $$$ or time on this one. Awful. The worst. Would rather drink Bud Light--and I hate Bud Light. The pour alone told me plenty--took ten minutes. WAYYYY too much carbonation. Little haze in a yellow/amber Almost smells like MGD I used to drink during high school. Tastes, er, well, no good taste. Flatish, waterish, badish. Wouldn’t waste the $$$ on this one again. Friends in P-Town tell me the best is on tap at the brewery, not in the bottle. I don’t doubt them after tasting this waste of ingredients.
Elmwood Pale Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Elmwood Brewing Company;Vile. After the HUGE frothy overflowing head, there was nothing. The aroma was metal and suet and arm pit. The palate was overly carbonated and acrid. Flavor was just awful.

Alcatraz Wee Creature;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Scottish Ale;Alcatraz Brewing Company;Poured a dark brownish color with a big off white head. Aroma was of dark malts, molasses and a little alcohol. Flavor was more dominated by the alcohol, but not unbearable, just because the rest of the beer is bland and is really malty.
Alcatraz Wee Creature;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Scottish Ale;Alcatraz Brewing Company;Brought a growler of this home from the brewpub in Indy about a month ago, just now getting to it. Nose of brown sugar, spice, and a trace of alcohol. Pours a deep walnut. Thin frothy light brown head has minimal lacing and is only around for a blink. Flavor is heavy and a bit on the sweet side. Nice alcohol warmth combats the still frigid early May temperatures of central Ohio. The full chewy soft body is a tad cloying, but still to my liking. A nice scottish to be sure.
West Berkshire B.R.A. (Berkshire Ruby Ale);Yattendon, Berkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;West Berkshire Brewery;"Bright bottled at Reading Beer Festival. I was not impressed when I sampled this at the festival. My notes say: ""Dark, sweet and tangy. Some oak. Score: 2.9 "" Looking at it now, the colour is a dark ruby, there is a pleasant port and raisin aroma, a good mouthfeel, and an interesting play between the soft sweetness and the gentle bitterness leading into a nice oak finish. But it’s not a stunner. It’s a decently made strong ale on a par with Fullers ESB, but it doesn’t rock my boat in the way that Moor’s Old Freddy Walker just has."

Clean gold with a good White head and lots of lace. Nice chewy resinous hop aroma with hints of citrus and a delicate sweetness in the background. The flavour is on a whole different level. And sadly, not a good one. Metal. Full on metal. It’s like sucking on a tin can. Bloody awful and not fit for sale. Spoons? Surely the brewer wouldn’t let it go like this. Must have been Spooned.

Starts with sweetish malt, balancing hop arrives, malt comes back, and the finish is hop. Moderate mouthfeel - thin, but swishing improves. IBUs probably exceed the average amber. Something like a malty IPA - compare to Deschutes Inversion. Just a thought. Very pleasant to drink.
Etna Phoenix Red;Etna, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Etna Brewing Company;This is nothing special, a beer that you immediately know what you are getting as soon as it is poured. All the typical characteristics are there and I cannot really add anything that has not already been said in pervious reviews. Not too bland but not too sweet in the malty side, with some fleeting hoppiness as an afterthought.
Etna Phoenix Red;Etna, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Etna Brewing Company;Nice amber color,medium sized off white head that had a decent hangtime then faded to leave a bit of a lace behind.The aroma was caramel and malty with a slight hint at the hops.The flavor had a nice malty side some caramel maybe toffeeish and faint hops in the end.Pretty much an ordinary brew with little going on for flavor,but it’s worth trying once,but i think it would be a waste spending the shipping dough to get.
Etna Phoenix Red;Etna, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Etna Brewing Company;12 oz bottle Reviewed again at the At Hops in Humboldt Micro-Brew Festival. Nice amber color, with nice tan head. Lots of malts, and good hops. This one of those that was better in the beginning than at the finish. Mouthfeel ws OK, but nothing outstanding. However when all is considered this is a nice brew and easy to drink. After re-reviewing this my rating stays the same.
Etna Phoenix Red;Etna, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Etna Brewing Company;Dark amber color. Aroma of toasted malts and caramel. Lightly sweet malt, toast and caramel. A light touch of hops. Not incredible but easily drinkable.

Full Mash Whistling Dixie;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Full Mash Brewery;Gravity, Reading Beer Festival. Yellowish session bitter. Sharpish, clean and crisp. Pleasant, but lacks distinctive character. Some apple acidity. OK.
Big Sheep Ewe Bitter;Bideford, Devon, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Country Life Brewery;Gravity, Reading Beer Festival. First beer of the second day. Chrissie’s choice (she liked the name). Fruity amber session bitter with a gentle but nicely dirty earthy finish. Decent stuff.
Boggart Dark Side;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Porter;Boggart Hole Clough;Mid dark brown pint with a decent head. Taste is fairly standard burnt malts, sweetness and caramel, mild bitter finish. Ok but unexciting.
Boggart Dark Side;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Porter;Boggart Hole Clough;A Mes rate: Cask at Chelmsford Beer Festival. Red brown colour. Simple aroma but with some lovely coffee malt that continues over into the flavour with a nice and creamy bitter hop finish. Little on the watery side or it could be excellent. Enjoyable mellow porter.
Boggart Dark Side;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Porter;Boggart Hole Clough;Cask Handpump at the Mill Hotel, Chester 28/06/2001 Dark coloured mild with some roast malt and bitterness in the finish.
Boggart Dark Side;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Porter;Boggart Hole Clough;Cask, Birmingham Fest 05. Very dark brown with a small head. Aromas are sweet and earthy and lightly floral, a touch oaty, too. Flavours are sweet, earthy roast malts with chocolate and berry fruit. Has a nice gently carbonation. Dry towards the finish. Decent stuff.
Boggart Dark Side;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Porter;Boggart Hole Clough;This is a beer with a little bit of everything, but not a lot of anything, if you know what I mean. Yep, it prompted that is it a stout/porter/mild debate in my head too(I would have gone for stout incidentally, not that that matters). Black, with a hint of red. Sweet with a hint of bitterness. Roast malt, with a hint of fruit. Dark chocolate, with a hint of coffee. Smooth with a hint of acidity etc etc. It might sound like a bit of a mish mash but its all pretty well integrated and refined. But, in the end, it doesn’t quite deliver the knockout punch. Mustn’t grumble though. Cask (handpump), Crown Inn, Bacup.
Boggart Dark Side;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Porter;Boggart Hole Clough;Cask conditioned - handpump - Head of Steam Euston. A bit of sour fruit in the aroma oof this very dark brown porter. A good roasty taste with a bit of coffee.
Boggart Dark Side;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Porter;Boggart Hole Clough;Hand pulled at the Head of Steam, Euston, with Joeh and Maeib. I had this down as a pretty flavoursome Mild, though as previously mentioend, it is getting harder to tell the difference. Nice roasty aroma, with a dry coffee flavour initially, finding some sweet water afterwards. Nice blend easy drinking.
Boggart Dark Side;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Porter;Boggart Hole Clough;Cask conditioned at the Head of Steam, Euston, London. Dark & roasty, malty and fruity, fairly flat, bitter finish.
Boggart Dark Side;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Porter;Boggart Hole Clough;On draught hand pump from The Babington in Derby (during the Wetherspoons Octoberfest, though not a beer that was part of the fest it’s self) Dark brown/Black in colour. Pretty Vinegary & it had only been on for 2 or 3 days so shouldn’t have gone off. Very disappointing. [b]re-rate[/b] Straight from the Cask at the Chesterfield Beer Festival on 04/02/05. A bit better this time - but not much - 8/20 this time
Boggart Dark Side;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Porter;Boggart Hole Clough;Gravity, Reading Beer Festival. Dark creamy velvet vanilla stout with a gentle but refreshing mouthfeel. Coffee mingled with diacetyl toffee. Very pleasant. One of the better beers at the festival. Saturday was slightly warmer than the Friday, so the beers were fractionally more developed. I had this down as a stout. Mild, Stout, Porter - they all seem to merge into the same beer most of the time.
Fyfe JPS;Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fyfe Brewing Co.;A light fruity pilsner pretty average, Had from a 5litre minicask, got from brewery.
Fyfe JPS;Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fyfe Brewing Co.;Cask Stillage at the Bhurtpore Inn, Aston 14/07/2004 Golden coloured hoppy fruity and slightly pale. Some bitterness in a crisp lasting malt finish.
Fyfe JPS;Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fyfe Brewing Co.;Horrible smokey bread taste to this, like someone burnt the loaf. Not convinced it’s supposed to taste this phenolic, but if the brewers send out beer like this then they deserve all the criticism they get. (Cask @ Reading BF)
Fyfe JPS;Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fyfe Brewing Co.;Bright bottled at Reading Beer Festival. A golden premium bitter. This is the weakest beer I bottled at the festival. And the palest. There is no condition, though it still tastes fresh. At this point it seems rather lifeless, lacking in flavours and quite joyless really. There’s some orange citric flavour, but not much. I’ll stick to beers over 6% in future.
Goose Island Willow St. Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Clayborn pub. Quite clear pour for a Wit with a small white head. malt and Coriander in the aroma carries to the taste. Very low bitterness and almost no aftertaste. Quite a nice refreshing summer beer.

Nose is full of citrus and light coriander. Nice crisp wheat flavors. Good clean citrus on the finish.
Goose Island Willow St. Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at GI Clybourn. Poured a hazy medium amber with a darker middle.. short white head. Nose was very mild, with light wheat and non-distinct yeast... almost approaching pale lager. Sweet malts in the flavor.. light sour highlights from the wheat.. caramel. Light-bodied, almost watery. This was non-offensive, but really had nothing going for it.
Goose Island Willow St. Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);luckily i ordered a 5oz sample of this and wasn’t charged for it. It was really malty for a wheat beer. it’s not great good and borderlines on bad.

Goose Island Willow St. Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);I wasn’t expecting much from this one, and I got no surprises. Cloudy with low head. Slightly bitter and with a slight dry finish. It’s a simple wheat beer with a smooth flavor. I didn’t notice at the time, but I could pick out the banana flavor that everyone else is talking about.
Goose Island Willow St. Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Clybourn. Wierd that they should have 2 american wheats on tap, but both were pretty good. THis one is a bit deeper gold than the urban wheat. Aroma is a bit more intense wheat, a touch more hoppiness, and a bit fruitier, but still no clove or banana like a german wheat. Flavor is a bit more pronounced due to the bigger body and higher abv than the urban wheat. Wheat, bready, slighty citrus, lightly herbal and somewhat sweet, but finishes nice and crisp.
Goose Island Willow St. Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at Clybourn: Golden hue with small fizzy head and little lace. The aroma has noted of lemon and lemongrass, light toasted malts, buttery, and dusty esters. Mild citric twang with noted of apple and lemon. Chalky and bready background. A straight forward American wheat ale. Watery and clean, fizzy feel. Argggh, yet another so-so American wheat. Go down to Piece for some real Weizens!
Goose Island Willow St. Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Yellow color with no head. Slightly sour wheat aroma. Very watered down wheat taste with not much showing up.

Lemon...Sweet Malt and ALOT of Wheat Flavor.....Hop Dry Ending. Sweet Overall. A Bit Unbalanced with So Much Wheat Coming Out. Still Enough Reasons to Find it Enjoyable.
Emmetts Poppin' German Pilsener;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Draft at source. Nose is faintly catty but mostly grassy hops. Light sulfur, very faint. Super clear pale gold with a small white head. Crisp malt backbone with a seemingly subdued but there hop flavor. Mild I guess but might be the variety of hop. Decent and clean
Emmetts Poppin' German Pilsener;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Emmetts Brewing Co.;"Draft at Downers Grove as ""Poppin’ Pils,"" Solid gold color, filtered to look clean, open bubbly head. Smell has a touch of sweetness, but also some noble hop pepper. Big, filling flavor from first sip. Plenty of golden roast barley managed by German hops. Still a bit of yeast, but a full and filling brew."

Emmetts Poppin' German Pilsener;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Clear gold color with no head. Aroma is reminicent of corn syrup. Strong grains (barley, rye?) dominate the flavor and push it towards the grain silo zone, though not quite there yet. No bitterness at all.
Emmetts Hefe-Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Taste: crisp, tangy, semi sweet, a bit toothy, wheat. A aroma of a wheat field, some citrus nose. Deep gold hue, semi unfiltered,nice head and lace. Medium body. Have many years ago.
Emmetts Hefe-Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Nice hefe. Lots of banana and clove flavor a bit thickets than most others. Compared to German too which is much lighter flavor ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Emmetts Hefe-Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On draft at the Dundee location. A good hefeweizen. Nice banana and clove flavor, true to the style. Might be the best offering from this brewer.
Emmetts Hefe-Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Tap in Palatine. Pours hazy yellow with a medium, fizzy white head, long retention with excellent lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (bread, cookie, hay), no hops, huge banana nose, and citrus notes. Flavor is malt and sweet, candied bananas, and citrus notes. Light body and carbonation, low warmth, and a dry finish.
Emmetts Hefe-Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Draft. HUGE candy banana aroma here... way too much of that. Flavor tones that down a tad and is quite well balanced and attenuated, beautifully dry, complex hefe flavor, has all the right players, bit of burnt rubber, medium banana, love the dryness. Great body, dry and well attenuated. Unfortunately the overly phenolic and estery aroma really detracts from the drinking experience.
Emmetts Hefe-Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewery in W. Dundee- poured a bright hazey yellow with a big fluffhead. Instant aroma of bananna, yeast and lots of wheat. Taste was rich and refresing at the same time, ecspecially on scorcher like today. Little spice in the finish with some noticeable clove.
Emmetts Hefe-Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Tasted at Emmetts Tavern in West Dundee during their quarterly beer tasting. Cloudy golden color with a slight orange coloring, very thick white head and a mod/high amount of carbonation. Aroma has a pronounced lemon aroma with clove and bready notes. Flavor is a very robust lemon fruitiness, clove hides behind the fruit flavor but melds well with it. Yeast as a good amount of density to the brew and a smooth bready flavor with a slight dry ending. Overall a pretty good beer and a the perfect amount of yeast in your glass from tap.
Emmetts Hefe-Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On tap at the Downer’s Grove brewpub. Presented in a logo weizen glass with a cloudy orange/golden hue, a medium white head, and spotty lacing. The aroma was light grain, ripe banana, and spices. The flavor was these with a more pronounced clove note, subtle sweetness and a little dryness in the finish. A more subdued version than previous years, but still very sessionable.
Emmetts Hefe-Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Sampler at the brewery. Cloudy yellow, good head. Nice looking hefe. Very strong aromas of banana. Flavor follows suit- nice soft mouthfeel and lots of bananas and a touch of lemon/citrus at the end for balance. I liked it a lot.
Emmetts Hefe-Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;This draft brew from the ale house poured a small sized head of foamy fine to large sized long lasting white colored bubbles that left behind a semi-opaque dark yellow orange colored body with very good carbonation . The aroma was mild with floral malty notes. The mouth feel was mildly tingly at the start and very mellow in the finish. The flavor was thin missing the typical banana notes and favored the hops.
Emmetts Munich Light;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Emmetts Brewing Co.;We has this at the brewmaster dinner in Wheaton Illinois in February 2018 very nice flavorful light beer ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Emmetts Munich Light;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Taste: Smooth and crisp, some hops and mellow malts, notes of corn tortilla. Mild corn grain and hop nose. Straw color, somewhat unfiltered, with a white head of delicate lace. Lite body. I would rate it higher if if liked the style.
Emmetts Munich Light;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Draft at downers grove. Light honey and sweet malt aroma. Very clear pale yellow with minimal white head. Light sulfur yeast aroma. Taste is very sweet with a light mineral water quality to it. Kinda sweet and bland. Not crisp
Emmetts Munich Light;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On draft at the Dundee location. Straw gold in color. A skunky aroma and flavor. Rather easy drinking with some flavor, but the flavor just is not that great. A below average brew.
Emmetts Munich Light;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On tap at Emmett’s, pours a clear light gold with a thin head, the aroma is of slight fruit with a little bit of grain, the flavor is the same, grain flavored water with a hint of fruit in the finish, really boring.
Emmetts Munich Light;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Had this at Emmetts in downers grove from draft, part of a flight. Yellow and clear. Not much to say here. Straw and slight fruits. Standard lager
Emmetts Munich Light;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Emmetts Brewing Co.;[Tap] Pint on tap at Flaco’s Tacos in Wrigleyville. Very hazy yellow colored pour. Little head on top. Sweet cereal grains, straw and light adjunct aroma. Taste is of mild noble hops, wheat malt, light graininess and a distinct lemon flavor. Light in body. Honestly, the beer was better than it sounds though. It came together all right and paired well with what I was eating.
Emmetts Munich Light;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Tap flight at the brewery. Very clean light yellow pour with a decent white head. There appears to be a greenish tint to the brew when it sits on the bar. Holding the glass up to the light reveals that it is just a very, very pale yellow. Buttery hop aroma. Flavor is slightly sweet like buttered sweet bread with nice flowery hops and jellied candy flavors. Much more complex and interesting than expected. Grainy flavors blend in well with the sweetness and bitter hop flavors. Clever and well crafted.
Emmetts Munich Light;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Paddle sampler on tap at the brewpub (Downers Grove, IL). My first visit to Emmett’s. Pours a nice pale straw gold hue, a touch of darkness, fairly transparent pour with a smaller brighter white head atop. Dies to a small tiny ring of white bubbles with faint lacing. Aromas are toasty and grainy, bready and cereal grains dominate the nose. Dough, some dry grass and light spiciness hit the nostrils. Fairly aromatic for a lighter style here. Bready and doughy, yet not overbearing and a mellow spice and dry earthy hopping. Initial is lighter bodied, with a touch of girth into the middle, dry cereal grains, touches of toast, bready dough and mellow wheat. Pale grains, mellow touches of faint honey offer some mellow sweetness. Middle pushes some spice, a touch to the body, and some decent dry florals, earthy spicy hop focus. Lingering bready and biscuity malts stick around, some dryness and spice. Refreshing and lighter, fairly fresh and a dollop extra of body. Nice fresh beer that lacks complexity but is fairly drinkable. Cleaner, efficient.
Emmetts Munich Light;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Tap at Emmett’s in Downers Grove on Dec. 27, 2011. Sweet honey and grain nose. Clear pale yellow pour. Thinner palate, slightly syrupy. Buttery grain taste.
Elmwood Blonde Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Draught at Old Chicago in Coralville, IA. Clear golden color with foamy white head that laced the glass. Attractive aroma of vanilla and cream. Buttery, malty caramel flavor. Dry on the tongue with a pleasant, smooth mouth feel. I liked this one so much I had another.
Elmwood Amber Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Elmwood Brewing Company;deep brown, thick tan head, good lacing. malty sweet aroma. flavor is sweet fruit, malt, i dunno... not cloying, but too sweet nonetheless. medium bodied smooth creamy. thanks to rayboy01 for this sample
Elmwood Amber Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Elmwood Brewing Company;"Bottle and served in a standard pint glass: A deep amber orangy hue with almost no head nor lace. The aroma has some notes of citrus, carmel, toffee, walnut, and some earthy yeast esters. THEN CAME THE TASTE... YUCK!!! There is an awful sourness and sulfuric character that makes this beer undrinkable. Now that I have read other ratings, it appears I am not the first the have this bad experience with this ""beer"". DRAIN POUR."
Elmwood Amber Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Elmwood Brewing Company;Pours a solid hazy brown color, way too dark for an ’amber.’ A thick head of tan foam reduces to just a film in a couple minutes. No lacing. There is a mild malty aroma, but I also find a whiff of sauermalt, which really seems out of place. The taste is initially malty with a mild toasted grain flavor. This is followed by some sugary sweetness. There is a mild hop presence in the finish. No sauermalt flavor - that was only in the aroma. Body on the light side, with mild but very fizzy carbonation. Somewhat thin but balanced.
Elmwood Amber Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Elmwood Brewing Company;Cloudy, amber/brown color, and slight off-white head. The aroma reminds me of apple cider, and the initial flavor does, too. Once the cider flavor is gone, caramel notes emerge, and that’s followed by mild coffee. Interesting, but I won’t be a repeat customer.
Elmwood Amber Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Elmwood Brewing Company;Draught at the 2006 Iowa City Brew Fest and again at Old Chicago in Coralville, IA. Clear copper orange color with off white head that laced the glass. Aroma was buttery caramel and toffee with light sprucy hops. Tasted of caramel, light brown sugar, and a touch of spicy black pepper. Second try was better than the first.
Elmwood Amber Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Elmwood Brewing Company;I see from other reviews that I’m not the only one who hated this. I though tit might have been a bad bottle. Extrememly sour aroma and flavor, I actually pured it out it was horrible. I hope it was just a bad batch.
Elmwood Amber Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Elmwood Brewing Company;In the bottle purchased in Peoria IL. Pours a very dark amber color, brown in fact. The head was very unusual for a commercial beer: super explosive and filled a 0.5L mug instantly with off-white foam before even a quarter of the beer could be poured. The foam aroma was of sorgum, but as the head subsided, an acidic burning aroma emerged. The taste is DISGUSTING: extremely tart and sour with little sweetness or any maltiness resembling beer. My guess is that I’m tasting a very bad bacterial infection of some sort that generated the acidic by-products of tartness and overcarbonation. The unusual thing is that there is no sulfur thiols producing a rotten egg smell. Since I was interested in a beer and not a microbiology project, I proceeded to pour my very first Ratebeer beer down the sink. BUYER BEWARE!
Elmwood Amber Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Elmwood Brewing Company;pours nice dark amber.huge foamy head. smells malty and a bit dusty. tast isnt bad just malt and caramel very little hop to balance.
Elmwood Amber Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Elmwood Brewing Company;The smell of stinky feet asserts itself out of the glass. The glass fills with a copper colored solution that rests under a big thick head. This beer tastes like the worst medicine your mom made you take when you where child.
Elmwood Amber Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Elmwood Brewing Company;This poured with a medium orange body. The aroma had flowers, orange peels and a hint of caramel. The taste had toffee and dirt dominating. Then there was old apple core and hint of cardboard. Sampled at the 2005 Iowa City Beer Festival.
Elmwood Dry Stout;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Elmwood Brewing Company;) This beer offers a bitter stale coffee smell as its aroma. It is blackish-brown in color and has a good thick head. This solution shouldn’t even be allowed to call itself beer. It is over carbonated and has too much yeast in it. Its taste is one, I assume, that would be experienced if ashtray were licked.
Elmwood Dry Stout;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Elmwood Brewing Company;Pours deep, dark brown, almost black. Overdone foamy tan head. The nose was burnt coffee and unsweetened Dutch cocoa. Thin and fizzy in the mouth. Taste was burnt coffee and bitter chocolate. Just an unpleasant experience for a stout.

Houston Warlock Stout;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Stout;Houston;Bottle from the Scottish Real Ale shop. Appearance - opaque black and silky with a creamy fawn head. Nose - caramel and biscuits. A hint of spice. Taste - caramel and liquorice over some biscuits again. A touch of smoky earthiness. Liquorice finish. No chocolate though so should be a dry stout in my opinion. Palate - medium bodied with a crunchy texture and a dry crunchy finish. Overall - a fairly complex stout for the alcohol level even if it is atypical.
Houston Warlock Stout;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Stout;Houston;Cask at Scottish Real Ale Festival 2014. Dark brown body with a thin off-white head. Aroma of wood and lightly roasted malt. Flavour of plum and dark malts. Thin body with a watery, slightly oily texture. Very easy to drink.

Houston Auld Cooperheid;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Houston;Tasted this in the Saltcot, Saltcoats (JDW) in March 2008. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear copper in colour with a thin white head. Strong clemantine fruit in the intense aroma. Thin but refreshing mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt base gives a slight chewy digestive biscuit note with tart fruit notes of pink grapefruit and redcurrant present. Dusty hop resins give a short bitter aftertaste. Finish is malty with redcurrant fruit sweet in the mouth. An ok session bitter.

Houston Auld Cooperheid;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Houston;Cask conditioned at Banbury Beer fest 07. Reddish amber with small head. Lifeless beer, quite dull in characteristic, some diacytol with a sweetish note. Short finish. Didn’t enjoy.
Houston Auld Cooperheid;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Houston;Aroma hits straight away with caramel, however some grassy hops are kicking about too. Taste is similar, quite one dimentional and dull.

Felstar Chick Chat;Dunmow, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felstar;12th December 2010 Clear amber beer. Few bubbles for a head. Very low carbonation and dry palate. Sweetish malt with a little generic fruit sweetness. Finishes semi dry. No discernable hops. Flat. Not Felstar’s finest.
Felstar Chick Chat;Dunmow, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felstar;Bottle shared with HogTownHarry and Dave B. -- courtesy of Dave B. Pours a cloudy orange with a large rocky white head. Aroma is very yeasty along with spices and way in the back some malt and hops. The flavour isn’t very flavourful at all, what’s there is once again yeasty (almost Wheat beer-like) with some malt and spices and a hoppy bitterness. Somehow the palate has a harshness to it as if it were quite strong in alcohol but it’s only 4.1% so that’s odd. Average at best.
Felstar Chick Chat;Dunmow, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felstar;Bottle (500ml). Shared with blankboy and Dave B, courtesty of Dave B. Poured hazy deep orange with a large lasting off-white pancake batter head. What is that aroma? - tons of funky UK yeasts, woodiness, fresh mint, mostly fruity malt as it warms. Taste is a weird blend of a sharply bitter UK ale and a generic belgian wit - very odd, quite bitter - I don’t like it that much, and it tastes like it has way more alcohol than 4.1%. Mouthfeel very bitter. Odd.
Felstar Chick Chat;Dunmow, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felstar;Bottled. Amber coloured. Fruity aroma. Sweet and fruity flavour with notes of candy and some yeastiness.

Felstar Chick Chat;Dunmow, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felstar;Gravity, Reading Beer Festival. This was one of Chrissie’s choices - again because of the name. It’s a dark amber session bitter. Earthy hops play over soft toffee malt. Some herbs - rosemary and tyme. Some banana. Toffee again. A bit flat, but gets interesting. Easy to dismiss, but rewards attention.
Wellington Hoppy Waters;Hope Valley, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Edale Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Kelham Island Tavern, Sheffield 01/05/2004 Golden coloured and very hoppy. Fiishes crisp and bitter on the palate.

Ellicott Mills Black Forest Lager;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Ellicott Mills Brewing;Deep brown, borders black space, milky white head. Malty chocolate, roasty, raisin, and rum in the nose. Flavors are chocolately and mild citrus hops. No other way to really describe it. Full bodied, pillow soft carbonation, semi dry finish.

Ellicott Mills Black Forest Lager;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Ellicott Mills Brewing;Pours black and opaque (I think it was dark in the bar). Mild aromas. Flavor was a nice sweet roastedness with mild fruity esters that seem to be in all the Alpenhof brews. The flavors where fairly gentle but where very nice. This is a top notch session beer.
Pärnu Mee Õlu;Pärnu, Estonia;Traditional Ale - Other;AS Puls Brewery;500ml bottle (SadaMarket, Tallinn) Oh, well, if everyone else is doing retrospectives, then I guess I can too. I remember this one as it was only my second ever non-Saku non-Coq beer from Estonia (the first being one I remember everything about apart from the name, and it’s not on RB or even on any label collection webpages). Anyway, this was a very easily drinkable honey-aromad and -flavoured beer. A tad too sweet. Palate slightly sticky with sugars, which remained in the finish. The recipe was cleaned up a bit when it came out as Puls, but it’s fundamentally the same beer. (Actually, I think they simply upgraded their water filtration and ion exchange process, and it’s probably the identical recipe.) Best of the haul from the fridge that trip. I can date this to ~2006 as the Puls brand had appeared and was just about to take over.
Pärnu Mee Õlu;Pärnu, Estonia;Traditional Ale - Other;AS Puls Brewery;From the Archives: This was a decent beer. Available for a short time at least 10 years ago. Sweet and easy going.
Pärnu Mee Õlu;Pärnu, Estonia;Traditional Ale - Other;AS Puls Brewery;500ml bottle (Ararat Y2K). Hazy yellow color. Strong dry honey aroma, sweet and papery too. Sweet, honey, papery, acidic, lemon in taste. Way too sweet for me, but my friend seems to like it. He is weirdo.
Pärnu Mee Õlu;Pärnu, Estonia;Traditional Ale - Other;AS Puls Brewery;Bottled. Honeyish golden colour with big white head. Strong sweet honeyish aroma. White bread and honey in flavour. Indeed a honey beer. Also some licorace noteable in flavour underneath the boom of honey. Not bad, but almost too sweet.

Pärnu Mee Õlu;Pärnu, Estonia;Traditional Ale - Other;AS Puls Brewery;Bottled, Stockholm Beer Festival. Golden, firm head. Syrupy and sweetish with notes of honey pastilles. Medium bitter.
Pärnu Mee Õlu;Pärnu, Estonia;Traditional Ale - Other;AS Puls Brewery;Golden. No doubt there is honey in it. Too much honey, by the way. I did not feel much else and I want a beer to taste more than just honey... Very sweet.
Pärnu Mee Õlu;Pärnu, Estonia;Traditional Ale - Other;AS Puls Brewery;Golden, godd steady white head. Clean and fresh but a tad too syrupy sweet honey honey aroma with hints of grassy malt. Fresh honey flavour with hints of licorice, minrals and grass in the long aftertaste. Medium bitterness.
Pärnu Mee Õlu;Pärnu, Estonia;Traditional Ale - Other;AS Puls Brewery;Bottle @ Stockholm Beer Festival I don’t like honey in beers, this is however an exeption. Very nice, fresh honey aroma with a hint of recently cut grass. Good balance of malt/honey. I think I can drink two of this on a hot summers day.
Pärnu Mee Õlu;Pärnu, Estonia;Traditional Ale - Other;AS Puls Brewery;Bottled. Hazy golden, airy head. Menthe like honey aroma. Sweet and soothing, medium bodied. This style of honey beers appears to be common throughout the Baltic countries.

S: Nice aroma of toasted bread, toffee, and light caramel. There is definitely some lager yeast in there and a touch of earthiness I would assume comes from the hops. Perhaps a light floral note as well. T: More of the same as I take a drink. Nice toasted malt flavor with a really substantial breadiness. Moderately sweet with some toffee. There is a subtle earthiness to the beer and some yeastiness. A very mild bitterness. M: Medium in body with a nice crisp carbonation. O: Quite refreshing and rather pleasant to drink.

Schans Dubbel Klap;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Dubbel;Brouwerij De Schans;Bottle, brewed for the Open Day 13 june 2004, gift from the brewer. Named Schans Dubbel. The ABV is the same, so I guess it’s this beer. Very dark brown color, small but persisting creamy head. Chocolate and Mon Chéri cherry bonbon aroma and flavor. Roasted malt. Alcohol. Thinnish probably because of the everpresent alcohol. Chocolate and alcohol aftertaste, almost like Tia Maria. A taste bomb!!
Schans Dubbel Klap;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Dubbel;Brouwerij De Schans;Chocolate syrup aroma, soy sauce too (as said by duff). Chocolate dominates flavour, sweet though balanced. Full smooth feel. Nice.

Schans Dubbel Klap;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Dubbel;Brouwerij De Schans;Bottle at Beer Circus, Croydon</>. Another seldom seen beer from this well stocked Croydon bar. Very chocolty, sweet, coffee. It almost tasted a little stale but overall was good.
Schans Dubbel Klap;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Dubbel;Brouwerij De Schans;Bottle. Thanks again to Gazza for sharing. I’m starting to realise I owe him a few drinks! This had an oxidized caramel aroma with hints of leather and was by far the best part of the experience, certainly quite interesting if not exactly pleasant. Mousse mouthfeel, which is often the problem with bottle conditioned beers - they need time to settle in the same way that a cask needs to settle after being tapped. Anyway, when it had settled a bit the alcohol could be felt. Perhaps this was too young to be drunk right now. It’s certainly a rough brew with the flavours not quite making themselves known other than for a general caramel experience. Given more time this beer might be rather good.

Disguises the hops, stale nose. Bitter and strong malty, touch of malty biscuit. Generic beer taste, some fluffy taste (like drinking head, but not actually drinking head). No palate, watery, boring, uninspiring. Don’t think it was at its best, but still, really really dull.

Slaughterhouse Wild Boar;Warwick, Warwickshire, England;Porter;Slaughterhouse Brewery;Tried at the Wild Boar, Warwick. Amber colour with a tan head. Deep fruity aroma. And a sweetish taste.
Slaughterhouse Wild Boar;Warwick, Warwickshire, England;Porter;Slaughterhouse Brewery;Cask at the Wild Boar, Warwick. I tasted this ale at the brewery earlier this year, but the slightly more mature version is a big step up. A gorgeous dark mahogany pour with a signature creamy, slightly off white head. A malty aroma, with a lovely smooth roasted malty flavour with surprisingly little bitterness. At 5.2% it's a little stronger than an average English bitter, but there was little evidence of that. Well, not in the taste anyway :-) A truly wonderful session beer! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Slaughterhouse Wild Boar;Warwick, Warwickshire, England;Porter;Slaughterhouse Brewery;A Mes rate: Gravicask at Coventry Beer Festival. Mid red brown with nothing going on in the head department. Decent malt in the aroma but an appley note lets it down. A bit out of condition sadly and it shows in the mouth. Some coffee, a bit chalky and dry and too much apple. Far from great.
Slaughterhouse Wild Boar;Warwick, Warwickshire, England;Porter;Slaughterhouse Brewery;"Cask conditioned - handpump - Wellington, Birmingham. Neither a porter nor a stout in my book; just an English Strong. It is dark mahogany in colour. There are malty fruity bready notes in the aroma. These attributes are also in the taste where coffee makes an appearance. It’s a pretty tasty beer with an added alcohol bonus."

Cloudy orange amber in colour with a thin white head quickly disappearing. Hint of orange oil in the brief aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing.

Landshuter Prädikator;Landshut, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Landshuter Brauhaus;Dark brown and almost black color, and the light-lasting foam on top. The aroma is sparse and limited to a little hard roasted malt. The taste is very accomplished and irresistible for a bock fan like me. It’s cute on a little candy-like fashion, but still with caramel sweetness in front. Light tones of plum and raisin blends in well with the hard roasted and lightly roasted malt notes, and together give it a slight aftertaste of licorice. Hop bitterness is gentle but breaks just right sweetness of the beer so it never at any time becomes too cloying.

Etna Old Grind Porter;Etna, California, United States;Porter;Etna Brewing Company;Bottle split among friends into snifters.

The flavor was exactly what I expect in a Porter mild roasted malts balanced out with just the right amount of sweetness. It only shortcoming was the mouthfeel was a little to light for me.

Karg Weizen-Bock;Murnau, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei Karg;Der Weizen Bock sieht im Glas karamellfarben aus. Die reichlich vorhandene Hefe bildet unterschiedliche Schlieren. Die Schaumkrone ist feinporig und ist ordentlich im Bestand. Der Antrunk ist malzig, recht würzig (wie nach Kräutern) und etwas fruchtig. Daß das Bier stärker eingebraut ist, ist erkennbar aber nicht dominant. Der Hefegeschmack ist im Abgang klar vernehmbar und zeigt sich sonst eher im Hintergrund. Ein gelungenes Hefe Starkbier, insbesondere die Mitte stellt den Höhepunkt in Sachen Würzigkeit, Geschmack und auch ungewöhnlich Spritzigkeit dar. Da das Bier so vollkommen ist, leidet darunter die Süffigkeit. Was man hier aber durchaus verschmerzen kann.

Murky, brownish amber with a thin, frothy, quickly diminishing, off-white head. Sweetish, yeasty-spicy and a little fruity aroma of banana, clove, toffee, cinnamon, vanilla and honey. Rather sweet, yeasty-spicy and quite fruity taste of pear, banana, toffee, clove, honey, vanilla and some peach, followed by a medium long, slightly bitter, quite yeasty-spicy finish. Medium to full body, slightly oily and only a little effervescent mouthfeel, soft to average carbonation. Doesn’t look very appealing, but aroma and taste make amends.

Zlate Temno;Medvode, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Zlate;Deepest brown pour topped by a gently lacing beige head. Quite yeasty for a dark lager and unclean, but better than most of its Slovenian rivals thanks to the avoidance of excessive sweetness.

High Desert Irish Red Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;High Desert Brewing Company;"Sampled July 2014 A steady pour from the growler into my teku glass produces a two-finger thick, pale amber tinged, tan colored head. The beer is a deep reddish-amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich amber hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells of berries, spicy whole grain malt, toasted whole grain, and toasted malt husks at first. There is a perceived sweetness to the aroma that is brought out by the fruit-leaning fermentation character, and accentuated a bit by the malt. The beer tastes a bit sweet up front, but finishes with a bitter hop bite to it that helps to dry things out a fair amount. The body has a viscosity to it that coats the palate nicely, and adds a definite chewiness to this beer without keeping it from being quaffable. There is a nice berry like fruitiness here that leans towards red-currants, but more nondescript red-berries of some sort, and there is also a light citrus character here that suggests of tangelo perhaps. There is a light herbal character here, just a touch of peppery character, and a nice spiciness that is all hop derived. The malt character is quite as pronounced, compared to the hop notes, as I was expecting, but still plays a prominent role; flavors of caramelize whole grain, a bit of spicy crystal malt character, the hop character is quite a bit more pronounced than I was expecting, though this is by no means a hoppy beer, but it is almost a bit more hop focused than it is malt focused. I wasn’t really expecting much from this beer, bland and boring’ish perhaps, but this is actually quite tasty, and very well balanced. Part of the reason I am enjoying this so much is that I expected so little from it, but I don’t really care."
High Desert Irish Red Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;High Desert Brewing Company;Tap @ High Desert. Pours a bit hazy, dark golden appearance with a khaki head. Sweet caramel/toffee, a bit earthy aroma. Slightly soapy, floral bitter hoppy, toasty caramel malty flavor. Ok.
High Desert Irish Red Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;High Desert Brewing Company;Not an Irish Red! Thos beer is closer to an American AMber but not an Irish Red. Too hoppy for an Irish Red but still not hoppy enough to make it an Amber.
High Desert Irish Red Ale;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;High Desert Brewing Company;Once again, another thanks to TannerTavernboys for introducing me to this brew. This beer pours something that is NOT at all red. It was the most goldeny yellow Irish red Ale i’ve ever seen. Perhaps it had a hint of amber, but really now, I don’t know what they were smoking when they brewed this. The aroma was very faint with slight hints of roasts and malts. The flavor is highly astringent with bittering hops and slight malty notes in the finish. This beer finishes dry but has a fairly weak mouthfeel. It’s hard to describe..but this tasted like a red but was lacking something.

Chama River Demolition Dubbel;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Dubbel;Chama River Brewing Company;Poured dark brown... darkest dubbel I think I’ve ever seen, and was gorgeous. It had a mild yeasty aroma... not overly done though. I think the best part of this was the subdued yeast profile, which is usually way too strong for me in most belgians. Had a lot of chocolate, caramel and malt flavors... Good stuff... 7.4% abv
Chama River Demolition Dubbel;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Dubbel;Chama River Brewing Company;I got to try this thanks to a beer swap with Erway. This is a fine example of a dubbel if I must say so. If I could get mine to taste this good I might open my own brewery. Nice maltiness with a good caramel sweetness. Complex and plenty of godness that you would expect from a dubbel.
Chama River Demolition Dubbel;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Dubbel;Chama River Brewing Company;Just an all around nice beer. Thick and malty with a nice alcoholic bite. A bit of a scotch note with smokey undertones.
Chama River Demolition Dubbel;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Dubbel;Chama River Brewing Company;Labeled 7%, pours a dense dark brown with a slight tan head. Big body and big malty flavor.

Chama River Demolition Dubbel;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Dubbel;Chama River Brewing Company;Clouded chestnut brown pour with a perfectly retained, creamy light tan head. Thin arc lacing, overall a great appearance. This just smells creamy and succulent. Roasty malt and well extracted every-element, with extremely well-integrated caramel. Notes of honeyed malt, cereal grain, cocoa powder, egg yolk, molasses and mild alcohol. A great(almost a 9) aroma. Mellow baked banana peel and even softer spice, raisins and miscellaneous dark fruit round out the nose. Upon first sip, the realization that this is overattenuated a touch doesn’t deter great enjoyment. This is a great take on a great style. Mild sweetness, very high nuttiness overtake the senses. Bitterness and astringency are low and complimentary. The Belgian yeast element is mild but lovely throughout. The finish is dry, nutty malt and light roast lingering. I would love to have more of this.
Chama River Demolition Dubbel;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Dubbel;Chama River Brewing Company;Courtesy hopscotch. Deep burnt ochre brown, very little head. Aroma is reodlent of sweet malts, treatcle, plums, some raisins. The flavor is what is to be expected, sweet and rich, with a touch of graininess that seems to work well. Good bottle.

Very nice dubbel.

Smells of dark malts, caramel, molasses, and some sweet dark fruits. Tastes of big caramel malts, dark berries, a little molasses, and a little wood. The finish is a little woodsy as well, mildly sweet, and oaky. The caramel and malts were the most prominent in the finish and the aftertaste however. Pretty solid.
Chama River Demolition Dubbel;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Dubbel;Chama River Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewery on a business trip . . . was rushed for time so I couldn’t give it a chance to warm up (of course it was served too cold) - but pretty solid I must say.

Blue Corn Euro Pale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Corn Cafe & Brewery (Albuquerque);"Deep golden body, mild carbonation, and velvety white head. Grassy, woody aroma. Flavor is like roasted nuts with a little smoke and some toasty malts, a little butter, bananas and more grass. This is a wild beer. Creative and very educational actually. The individual qualities of the ingredients stand out more than they seem to when they’re found in the ""appropriate"" styles. This is bold."

Leek Brahms and Liszt;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);"Bottled. Clear, still gold. Aromas are buttery, caramel, hops and some Leek oddness. Flavours are more of the same with some floral notes and a bit of soapiness. Has that unique Leek ""something"" about it. Still, Brahms and Liszt is a good name for a beer."
Butford Farm Perry - Dry (Draught);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Butford Farm Cider;From the barrel at GBBF, day 3 on 3 August 2006. The ABV for this seems to be all over the place as it was 5.0% on this occasion. Hazy yellow colour. Smooth, slightly peachy and easy-drinking. Pleasant enough but doesn’t really have sufficient depth of succulent fruit to charm or enough tannic grip to challenge. I wonder whether the lower ABV suggests a rather poor year for the pears with relatively low sugar and extract rates.
Butford Farm Perry - Dry (Draught);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Butford Farm Cider;Plastic cask, 6.2% at GBBF08. Acidic aroma, a little vinegar. Spreewalder Gurken flavour. Not bad. Milky very pale yelllow colour.

Butford Farm Perry - Dry (Draught);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Butford Farm Cider;Barrel – GBBF. A hazy dark lime green coloured perry. The aroma has the obvious pear but also maybe a touch of ginger. The taste is fairly sweet with pear skins and some tannin notes. Drinakble.
Butford Farm Perry - Dry (Draught);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Butford Farm Cider;Polypin at Merton Beer Festival Sat 18th Feb. This really was an excellent Perry it was actually a medium at 4% rather than dry as I noted from the cask label. Fantastic to have a Perry at this strength rather than coming in at 6, 7 or 8%. Wonderfully flavoursome, loads of pear leaping out at you, a very pale lemon colour makes you just want to keep gulping, great!
Butford Farm Perry - Dry (Draught);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Butford Farm Cider;Polypin at Merton Beer Festival, Oxon. Pale lemon, opaqe, no head.

Naish Dry Cider;Glastonbury, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Naish Cider;August 28, 2013 - on draught at Euston Cider Tap. Hazy gold, no head. Smells and tastes like an apple lambic - apple, sour lemon, wool - sour as f*&k!!! Thick, massively acidic, still, long dry buzzing finish, leaves an odd burnt sour baked apple aftertaste - this made me gassy for a whole friggin’ day but it was worth it.
Naish Dry Cider;Glastonbury, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Naish Cider;Leicester Fest 10. From a barrel into a 1ltr plastic milk bottle as a take home. Hazy golden orange in colour.

Fort Collins Maibock (Spring Bock);Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Fort Collins Brewery;I like this. It’s not the best every but certainly good. There are a lot of solid things going on here: aroma has a rich malt and toffee character, the taste is toffee sweet and balanced, and the finish is good too. I’m usually not a big fan of Fort Collins Brewery stuff but this one is pretty good.
Kingdom Chopping Block IPA;Burke, Vermont, United States;IPA;Kingdom Brewers;From my cellar: I was debating whether or not I should rate this one as it’s an IPA that’s been sitting in my cellar forgotten about for almost two years, but when I opened it and found no tell tale signs of spoilage, I decided to review it. The pour is very hazy and on the golden end of the spectrum with some floaties present in the pour and a very small white head. Smells of grapefruit and very slightly breaddy, but otherwise in good shape. Tastes of grapefruit, pepper, but most of the defining hop characteristics have mellowed out. In all likelihood, this one was pretty decent fresh as the bitter elements that define a good hop were still there after two years.
Kingdom Chopping Block IPA;Burke, Vermont, United States;IPA;Kingdom Brewers;22 oz bottle. Pours a very hazy luminous orange, slightly bubbly, little head, unfiltered and bottle-conditioned. Nice but slight orange-caramel aroma with a hint of pine. Pungent and rather sweet-sour on the tongue, medium-bodied, hoppiness present but damped down somehow...like embers burning low, you know the fire was warm once, but is dying now. Just rather dull on the whole. Carbonation on the low side.

Craftsman 1903 Lager;Pasadena, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Craftsman Brewing Company;Aroma is one of beer’s most complex features. Aroma is propelled by lively CO2 and dampened by pillowy heads - especially nitrogen foam.

Craftsman 1903 Lager;Pasadena, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Craftsman Brewing Company;On tap at Trappist Provisions. Believe it or not, I’ve been tracking this one down for a while now. I can see why it’s rated so highly as a pale lager. It kind of changes your mind on what this style can actually be. It pours a clear golden color with a nice white head. The aroma is rather spicy and floral with a light maltiness that has some corn and apple, but not over the top. The flavor is full bodied with prominent spicy and floral hops, more corn and light malts. Very creamy mouthfeel. Excellent stuff.

Magic Hat Spaceman Ale;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Location: Draft at Professor Thom’s, 9/15/09 Aroma: Light floral and grass, some bready malts Appearance: Clear, pale yellow color Flavor: Mild and dull balanced malty and hop flavors Palate: Light body, fizzy, a touch too light Overall Impression: I’d never seen this beer before, and it is listed as retired here, but Professor Thom’s had them as their special for trivia night, so I tried it. Maybe because it is a Boston sports bar they get this beer? I have no idea, but anyway, here’s my rating, and by the way, if they want to re-retire (keep retired?) this beer, no one would be missing too much. This was pretty dull.
Magic Hat Spaceman Ale;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A bit weak for a limited brew, but still tasty. Citrus and bread-like malts in the taste. Little bit of that is the signature Magic Hat taste and some light hops. Pretty refreshing.
Magic Hat Spaceman Ale;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Another one of those Magic Hat brews that doesn’t fit a style; golden/blond would have been my third guess for this one. LIght orange-yellow color, medium white head. Aroma is flowery, chamomile at first, but then becomes moldy and mildewy. Not so good. Flavor is an improvement; wheat, citrus, refreshing, though bland. Typical Magic Hat style. Not worst place."
Magic Hat Spaceman Ale;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours with a white, two-fingered head, fades soon and leaves a good lace.

Magic Hat Spaceman Ale;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Art of Beer Festival 2004: Has a yellow color with a small white head. Smell is lightly malted. Taste is also lightly malted and finishes with a slight bitterness. Overall easy to drink, but nothing special.
Magic Hat Spaceman Ale;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"for those who DON’T know, Spaceman is in honor of Bill Lee,Sox lefty who pitched with the club from ’69 to ’78. On to the beer. Deep straw in color with a small white head.Subtle if anything,minute hops and malt. It doesn’t do the Spaceman justice to have such a ""plain"" ale named after him."
Magic Hat Spaceman Ale;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);I have no idea why Spaceman has any connection to baseball (as the label insinuates), or what the beer’s flavor and other characteristics have to do with the sport. Tastes a bit creamy, hints of anise, ginger? A bit heavy. A good even-handed swill for a well-metered, enjoyed round. Not fruity at all. Although heavy, would seem to be a good summer beer.
Magic Hat Spaceman Ale;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Art of Beer Festival 2004: Light straw color, light malty aroma with some light flowers, medium bodied, ends slightly bitter. Very nice for the style.

Quite pale aroma, some grassy hops with just touch of stench like rotten vegetables. Flavor quite fine, but too watery and blank even for the style.

Score 2.6"" and I like it even less now. I’ve been told that correctly bottled a beer can last for at least a week. I’m sure this one hasn’t. I can’t remember it tasting THIS bad on the day. The score today is undrinkable. I’ll give the score on the day."
Capitol City Roggin Rye Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Capitol City Brewing Company;Clear red-brown body with smooth off-white head. Aroma is sweet, caramel, light rye. Taste is medium sweet, caramel, some rye. Medium body, some caramel stickiness. The effect of the rye is to evoke an Irish Ale, but the caramel sweetness overpowers the the rye.
Capitol City Roggin Rye Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Capitol City Brewing Company;A nice heavy ale. Dark color with a very rustic nose. Tasted a lot like rye, unsuprisingly. Not bad, just a little heavier then i was expected.

Cleveland ChopHouse Irish Red Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);Tap at the brewery. Deep amber pour. Aroma is full of cooked vegetables and DMS. Light earthiness on the back although it’s tough to tell with all the diacetyl and dirty fusels. Lingering dull sweetness. It’s like a case study in bad brewing.
Cleveland ChopHouse Irish Red Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);tap @ the ChopHouse - red/orange pour. Toffee, caramel, vegetal and cabbage aftertaste. Hot mess.
Cleveland ChopHouse Irish Red Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);On tap at the District ChopHouse in Cleveland on our way to RBSG. Pours a crimson hued orange brown with a medium sized white head. Malty, smells a little like brewing. With vegetables. Crisp metal, and a little more vegetal malt. Metallic and bitter grains. This was a terrible way to start off, but then I had something I thought was worse, so went back and tried this again... and nearly vomited. Horrible.
Cleveland ChopHouse Irish Red Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);Growler shared by a friend. He asked for the Irish Stout, but there’s no f’n way this is a stout. Clear amber pour with a medium beige head. Caramel malt nose with a bit of fruit. Caramel malt flavor with sprinklings of English hops. Average for the style.
Cleveland ChopHouse Irish Red Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);"Pint special at the bar, I had this after their Pale Ale and decided this was much better. Malty aroma of biscuits, caramel and toffee. Amber body with a bit of a hazy quality, on top sat a 3/4"" light tan head that left heavy lacing. Flavor is malt dominated and very soft, nuances of bread, grainy cereal, and nuts. A hint of noble hops create for a good balance. Medium to lighter in body, finishes slightly creamy. A good pub ale."

Cleveland ChopHouse Irish Red Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);Very malty for this brewery, some cocoa and metallic notes. Has a dark amber body with some caramel in the aroma. Probably their most rounded and well-crafted offering. I’d drink it again, and not on a dare either.
Cleveland ChopHouse Irish Red Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);I felt this was the best beer that they had. Caramel malts and sweet taste make this the only beer there that I would have again.
Cleveland ChopHouse Kolsch;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);Draft: Deep gold w/ a lasting white head. Fantastic floral hop aroma, maybe too much for a koelsch style, but very pleasant. Malt is low, but has a grainy aroma, and a low level of esters. Malty and well balanced, but has a more than moderate hop flavor in the finish and aftertaste, and fruitiness is very low. Very smooth m/f, creamy, low carbonation and has a medium body. Seems very similar to the Bo. Pils, but not quite as clean and crisp. Very good though.
Sinebrychoff Kaura;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Deutlicher Honiggeruch. Das Bier schmeckt recht mild, der intensive Honiggeruch passt so gar nicht zu dem Geschmack. Teilweise wässrig und nur leicht hopfig im Mittelteil geht es weiter in einen wässrigen Nachgeschmack, in dem dann tatsächlich ein leichtes Honigaroma auftritt. Nette Idee aber kläglich gescheitert. Test vom 8.8.2006, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 12,6,8,5,11,8 - 7,80
Sinebrychoff Kaura;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);I remember this one a bit repulsive I don’t know why. maybe the oats gave a flavor I didn’t like at all. Honey tried to compensate it but no success.
Sinebrychoff Kaura;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Lightly hazy light yelllow beer with interesting honeyish aroma. Quite sweet and lots of honey in the flavour. Easy to drink but not watery palate. Little bit more hops would make this better. Iinteresting beer with lots of honey.
Sinebrychoff Kaura;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Big head, hazy orange color. Very honeyish, rubbery aroma. Almost too sweet. Easy-going, sweet flavor dominated by tons of honey.
Sinebrychoff Kaura;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Obvious honey notes on the nose, and also comes through strongly in the mouth. Knowing it’s barley and oat makes it easy to put the finger on that providing the more interesting maltiness, but still little more than another inoffensive pale lager.
Sinebrychoff Kaura;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);bottled. honeyed nut aroma, semi-cloudy golden, pretty soft and drinkable with some honeyed sweetness and a peanut skin finish

Sinebrychoff Kaura;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Surprisingly quite good bier. Taste isn’t strong, aroma has some honey. An easy all-around beer.
Sinebrychoff Kaura;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);This is surprisingly good. I’m not really a fan of flavoured beers (honey in this occasion), but this ends up on my glass every once in a while. It’s a bit like weissbier, without the horrible banana flavour.
Sinebrychoff Kaura;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Bottle, 0,5l. This is a beer with a smooth feel on the tongue, and a strong honey-aroma and flavour. The honey is complementing this beer, not ruining it. It looks hazy but a bit more yellow than your typical wheat beer. Niiice surprice from Finland.

Buffys Rogers Ruin;Wicklewood, Norfolk, England;Strong Ale - English;Buffys Brewery;Cask at paisley beer fest. Alround rating: Spicey grassy richer malts, overly bitter without too much body. Sort of big sting beer that not really ment to be.
Buffys Rogers Ruin;Wicklewood, Norfolk, England;Strong Ale - English;Buffys Brewery;"Bright bottled at Reading Beer Festival. Notes on the day: ""Dark amber. Gentle sweetness - some licorice flavours. Soft spice. Barley Wine? Score 3.7"" This is a lovely drop. The spice is very christmassy, and this would do well as a winter warmer. The sweetness has dropped out a bit, but this is a beer that is more about the malt and the spice than the hops. Fully brewed so it doesn’t cling and is fairly clean and easy to drink. A strong ale or winter warmer rather than a barley wine."
King Annihilator Doppel Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;King Brewing Company;Heavy on roasty cocoa aroma. Massive head that looks like those beer commercials with the head protuding (huh huh, huh huh huh) 3/4 inch above the top of my wide conical. Huh huh huh, huh huh huh huh huh. Okay, I’ll stop there.
King Annihilator Doppel Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;King Brewing Company;2005. Purchased at Bello Vino, Ann Arbor, MI. Pours dark reddish brown, diminutive cream colored head. Nose is all malt with raisins, touch of alcohol, cashews, toffee and caramel. Taste is more of the same, but very focused as the flavors are very well melded together. Full bodied, palate was a little oily but nonetheless pleasurable from start to finish. I found this to be a very exciting, rich and well made dopplebock. Was the hit of a bock tasting several months after its purchase. Nice one.
King Annihilator Doppel Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;King Brewing Company;Bottle, from trade with walleye. Ok aroma, sweet. Soy, caramel, raisin/grape. plum. Little cardboard/paper thing too. Clean orangy dark brown color, massive head, half the glass on first pour, that slowly faded to one of those dead foam covers. Malty flavor, mainly a soyish grape thing. I get a little nuttiness I didn’t get in the aroma. Medium body, lite creamy mouthfeel, dry bitter finish. Eh, doesn’t do much for me. Seemed weak for the style. Oh well. Thanks walleye.
King Annihilator Doppel Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;King Brewing Company;Opaque, dark brown, almost black, with a voluminous, brown head from an intense carbonation. Aroma has a very hard water impresssion with some malty notes underneath that is proper for style with lots of milk and toffee and some bubblegummy richness. Flavor is quite odd and not very pleasant. I assumed the overcarbonation would ruin the palate with all of that extra carbonic acid does not seem to phase this one. That said, I have lots of trouble with the interpretations of beer styles from this brewery and its ’house character.’ There is something about almost every beer they produce that turns me away. This beer does not even fall into the bock or double bock category except for maybe alcoholic strength.
King Annihilator Doppel Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;King Brewing Company;12 oz bottle: A dark brown pour with a thick carbonated tan head. Aroma is malty, roasted coffee, alcohol, nice hop note, and a slight caramel scent. Taste consists of malts, chocolate, hops, slight coffee notes, and quite smooth. Palate is flat and everso slightly bitter. Overall, I liked this Doppelbock from Pontiac. Best to get it fresh.
King Annihilator Doppel Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;King Brewing Company;This bottled brew poured a large sized head of foamy finely sized mostly diminishing brown colored bubbles that left behind an unnoted lacing. The body contained average carbonation, was transparent and dark brown in color. Its aroma contained notes of nice caramel malt semi-vinous . Its mouth feel is initially slightly tingly smooth vinous flat with a lingering palate and a caramel malt aftertaste. Its flavor contained vinous malty caramel notes. I was missing the bock like qualities though nice, it was not bock like at all. All-in-all very nice brew.
King Annihilator Doppel Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;King Brewing Company;Bottle. Deep brown in coluor, thin beige head, some lace left behind. The aroma was of chocolate, toffee, nuts and some spice. The flavour was chocolatey, some caramel, smokey, chalky mouthfeel, lightish body for a dopplebock, medium carbonation. Finishes with a mild lingering bitterness.
King Annihilator Doppel Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;King Brewing Company;Deep copper, fari off-white head. Light rather dry nose with mellow chocolate and sweet toffee to pair a dry coffee and nutty palate. I looked hard for any smoky aspects as I felt they would have fit well, but there weren’t and the dry prickly carbonated mouthfeel don’t help it from being rather mundane for a dopplebock.
King Annihilator Doppel Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;King Brewing Company;RBSG 05. Deep amber/light brown with a decent head. Aroma of sweet caramel, munich malts, and some chocolate. Slight diacetly as well. Flavor had some roastiness, with chocolate malt and a slick sweetness to it. Mouthfeel was slick and sweet, but then finishes dry. High carbonation also hurts this beer.
King Annihilator Doppel Bock;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;King Brewing Company;RBSG Average-sized off-white head. Chocolate and molasses aroma followed by a lightly sweet, lightly acidic flavor. Dry finish. Needs more maltiness to round this one out.

Still, good amount of caramel and dark fruits throughout. Fairly sweet; Light yeast and light hops round things up. Boring… Hoppiness is light lemon and grass in nose. Lime and grassy hops in taste. Bitterness is medium for a lasting, mid-astringent sweet-bitter finish; Slightly dry after taste. Watery and sweet-bitter to mouth. Comments: This one had basic BdG elements - maltyness, musty nose, caramel taste and fair hoppiness, but it’s too watery and sweet. Maybe this is one of those light-style BdG for the summer, but it’s just a tad too light for me. Caution advised."

Hereford & Hops Schwarzbier;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;draft, room temp glass (finally, i had to cause a scene to earn one). infected H&H strawberry aroma - one of the only beers that presents inside the aroma as well as flavor. flavor is well balanced (haha) well developed roast and rubber strawberries. quite offensive combination. opaque body, coca cola edges, lingering initially filthy head and good lacing. soft, lush mouthfeel. roast disappears as strawberry overwhelms palate. small victory to finish a pint of this infected bastard.
Hereford & Hops Schwarzbier;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap at the Escanaba brewpub. aroma is a faint flow of roasted malt. Pours a deep brown with off-white rim. Flavor is ashy, salty and sea-like. Flavors develop some dry chocolate character, a bit of oaky and some nice sweet caramel. This isn’t bad. Deep and sustaining. Somewhat complex and developing. A bit of soda-like flavor, but nothing sugary. Very dry actually, and I can appreciate that. A bit of pepper and herring meld with the roast and salt. Nice. Good examples of this beer are starting to grow on me. There’s room for complexity and good style done subtly here.
Hereford & Hops Schwarzbier;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;A very nice and toasty schwarzbier. Aroma was ok. A nice blend of roasted malt and a hint of coffee. Pour was a nice deep dark brown with a pinky sized near tan head. Taste was a little thin in the front but all roasted malt and coffee in the middle and aftertaste. The finish didn’t carry it through, but had a nice warm toasted malt backbone. Not bad.
Hereford & Hops Schwarzbier;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Had this beer on draft at their newest brewpub in Cranberry PA.

Hereford & Hops Wausau Lager;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Happy to see this beer pulled out of retirement. On draught at the Wausau brewpub location, pours a clear copper amber brew with a thick and creamy white head that slowly dissipates to a fine film and white ring. Aroma of caramel malt, some nice dark pitted fruit character, flowery hops and a touch of apricots. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonated with a fruity caramel malt flavor with flowery hops and light spice. Finish is semi-sweet and very malty compared to its aroma of taste.

Lake Louie Louies Reserve Scotch Ale;Arena, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Lake Louie Brewing (Wisconsin Brewing Company);From Feb 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with orbitalrOx. Thanks Don. This is one of my favourite styles. :^) It pours from 12 oz bottle a hazy rusty brown with a 1 finger head of foam. It shrinks after a few minutes but there's still a fine layer(with god lacing) near the end of the session. The smell is of roasted and caramel malt along with some notes of chocolate and just a wee bit of alcohol. The taste has the caramel malt up front and gives me a nice sweet flavour. Now I get a bit of chocolate, big toffee, some smoke(nicely done) and some roasted malt. There's also some hops hiding in the background that I find more prevalent in the finish. Yum. The alcohol is just noticeable after the swallow but doesn't interfere with the flavour at all. The mouthfeel is medium bordering on heavy and feels silky smooth. Yum again. That toffee is really make this one very drinkable given the alcohol content. I'm really happy that I got to try this Wee Heavy as it's a darn good one!
Lake Louie Louies Reserve Scotch Ale;Arena, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Lake Louie Brewing (Wisconsin Brewing Company);Raisins and plums are definitely what you notice first in the aroma, with hints of butterscotch, too.

Lake Louie Louies Reserve Scotch Ale;Arena, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Lake Louie Brewing (Wisconsin Brewing Company);Notes from Scotch Ale tasting for St Patricks Day. Reddish brown pour with a faint head. Aroma of phenols, toffee and later butterscotch. Taste is light toffee, some butterscotch with dark fruits, and eventually other fruits. Not the greatest style, and this is also not a strong representative.

Freeminer Strip & At It;Cinderford, Gloucestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Freeminer;Cask@Newark Beer Festival. Golden beer with a light head, the aroma is light and the flavour is only lightly hopped and quite watery. A poor beer overall.
Freeminer Strip & At It;Cinderford, Gloucestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Freeminer;Cask Conditioned, at the GBBF, 2004. Sweet grain aroma. Dull golden ale. No head at all. Bitterness lives happily with the malt base. Lingering aftertaste of Musk and Musk.
Freeminer Strip & At It;Cinderford, Gloucestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Freeminer;Yet another pale gold, lager coloured summer beer. These seem to come in two styles. The first is very hoppy, with lots of citric bite and a quite tart finish. The second promises some hops in the aroma, but goes for a more mellow, easy drinking, lager feel on the palate. This one is firmly in the second camp. While it is clean and a touch fruity, it is not that crisp and the finish is rather soft and lacks grip. I prefer the sharper style. Cask (handpump), GBBF 2004, day 1.
Freeminer Strip & At It;Cinderford, Gloucestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Freeminer;Theobald Arms, Essex. This will be my last drink at this pub for a while. I’ve decided to go back to teaching, so I won’t be popping into the Moben Kitchens office anymore, which is only 10 minutes from this little scooping gem. Anyway, for my last drink: Pale amber session bitter with a lager quality about it. Dry with a thin malt base and a trace of hops. A bit wishy washy. Grassy aroma. I’m not keen on these lager type beers that the British brewers are putting out.

Dansk Mjød Skjalde Mjød;Billund, Denmark;Mead;Dansk Mjød;Non vintage. Bottle aged for 10 years after purchase. 14.8 % ABV. Tasting notes by memory: Amber colour. Appealing, complex and sweet nose with honey, herbs and spices. Rich and sweet (but not overly sweet) taste, complex, rounded, and well balanced. Did not in any way appear to be (too) old. The 14.8% alcohol was perfectly integrated. Although stored cold, within a few weeks after opening the mjød had lost part of its freshness and appeal and in particular the nose had undergone a negative transformation. So the advice is: Storing quality mjød can be rearding, but once opened, do (presumably) as the old vikings and drink it up!

Lysholmer Double Ice Summer;Oslo, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Bottle 330ml. Colour is yellow, clearer than water. Aroma has hay and honey in it, and the flavor is nothing worth of mentioning. If you’re tried Corona, you’ve tried Double Ice Summer.

Lysholmer Double Ice Summer;Oslo, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);330 ml bottle. Golden and crystal clear. Tall fine-laced head that clings to the glass. Soft floral hop aroma and smooth malts. Soft malty flavours and a crisp hop bitterness. A little grassy and papery. Nicely drinkable, and not really that bland as I had expected. Wife complains that it stinks, but I’ve had lot worse. Anyway, this beer is not particularly exciting. It reminds me a little of Flensburger Gold.

Lysholmer Double Ice Summer;Oslo, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);330ml bottle, 4.5% abv. Chalky white head that fades away quickly. Straw-golden body. It tastes and smells more like a sweet soft drink than a beer. Oversweet fruitiness and very lively carbonated. Not the right choice to my spicy, chicken food and far away from that summer feeling (Tromsø, 01.05.2009).
Lysholmer Double Ice Summer;Oslo, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);330 ml bottle.

Great Lakes Independence Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Billed as a red ale, but it’s a little yellow. Refreshing citrus flavor, this tastes like one of the trendier hop varietals but used in a fairly restrained way.

Sampled side-by-side with the Christmas Ale. Reviewed from notes. Pours a moderate amber color with a bit of a stronger reddish character when light hits the glass. A bit of a light head that dies down a bit too quickly. The nose brings some citrus and pine hops as well as some very lightly-toasted malt with a bit of bread and biscuit.

Struise Witte;Oostvleteren, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Struise Brouwers;На аромат это уже никакой не витбир, он очень кислый, много благовоний из сельской хвора, немного цветочных ноток, немного самой пшенички, немного фруктов а точнее цедры с цитрусовых, а также дрожжей. Пены очень маленькая, она шепит и исчазает, тело слегка мутное и желтоватая как хорошая моча. На вкус весьма кислый, и все таки больше похож на сизон а не витбир. Во вкусе есть много цветочных ноток, а также дрожжей с солодом, немного пшенички. При глотке легкая хмелевая составляющая. Хорошо ощущаются цитрусовые и конкретно снова цедра от апельсина.

McMenamins Habanero Gold;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Ahh, another pepper beer! This time for Cinco de Mayo. Small fizzy head, yellow watery color. Head and body give way to a nice creaminess that was unexpected. Aroma is slightly of peppers. Medium bodied. Taste is of peppers, but doesn’t overpower the beer like most pepper beers. Only a slight burning sensation, almost unnoticeable. For a pepper beer, this one was quite drinkable.

Rockyard Excavator Doppelbock;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Rockyard Brewing Company;!2 oz. bottle. 7.6% ABV per the label, so the recipe has changed from the origional. Pours a medium, well retained, ivory head, with slight lacing, over a clear amber (SRM 13) body.......nose is toasted malts with toffee/caramel tones, hints of cocoa, no hops, balance to the malts......taste is lightly sweet with toffee/caramel tones, light fruits including raisin, slight col tones, minimal hops......mouth feel, medium light body, slight alcohol, moderate carbonation. This is a very light version of the style, with a very light body. More malts and perhaps a technique change with more decoction mashing would improve. BJCP 6/3/11/4/5
Rockyard Excavator Doppelbock;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Rockyard Brewing Company;12 oz. looks like it was bottled Feb 2015. Pours red-copper with a lasting film of foam.

Medium body has low-medium carbonation and a dangerously drinkable balance, with just a faint hint of the abv.
Rockyard Excavator Doppelbock;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Rockyard Brewing Company;Caramel, raisin, chocolate, smoke, vanilla, nuts. From a bottle. Complex, nothing really ruins it, but the taste is a little more bitter and less malty than I expect in a dopplebock.

Rockyard Excavator Doppelbock;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Rockyard Brewing Company;Bottle @ home. Red orange appearance with a small, light colored head. Sweet caramel malty lager nose but also pretty bitter and just is off from style. Sweet, caramel, light toffee lager flavor. Fairly sweet malty, yet pretty boozy and bitter finish. The whole beer is a little off.
Rockyard Excavator Doppelbock;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Rockyard Brewing Company;12oz bottle - lightly hazy copper pour - they must have aged this batch on oak, because it dominates the nose and flavor - at first, it is pleasant, adding notes of vanilla, but it soon because overbearing and bitter, like sucking on a plank - some sugar, spicy alcohol, a bit of raisin - some vegetal notes are, sadly, some of the strongest characteristics to get past the oak - poorly done.
Rockyard Excavator Doppelbock;Castle Rock, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Rockyard Brewing Company;(draft at Trinity 9/20/10). Clear dark copper color. Medium off white head.

Not sure what the original 2004 rating was talking about, as this bock isn’t black and has no licorice flavors at all. Golden amber with a thin head. Aroma and flavor primarily light-roasted malt, slight nuttiness, with a light brown sugar/caramel sweetness. Creamy medium-bodied lager with a clean slightly boozy finish.

Alhambra Mezquita;Granada, Spain;Pilsener - Imperial;Cervezas Alhambra (Mahou San Miguel);Muy muy pobre. Ningún aroma, casi ningún sabor. No es tampoco una IPL, quizá intenta ser una doppelbock, aunque desde luego no lo consigue. Una cerveza a evitar (ni la terminé).

Blacksburg Hefe Weizen;Blacksburg, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Blacksburg Brewing Company;I’ve had two different wheat beers from these guys and they were both superb. At a beer festival I had theirs alongside 4 other breweries with excellent reputations and BBC beat them hands down. Flavor is clean and crisp wheat, slight cloves. Great head, typical cloudy golden look. They don’t bottle so you’ll have to look for this one on tap if you’re in Blacksburg. Definately worth checking out.
Van Pur Karpackie Pils;Warsaw, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Van Pur S.A.;Okay white foam and medium darker clear gold body, smells like rotting burlap doused in gasoline.

Van Pur Karpackie Pils;Warsaw, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Van Pur S.A.;Smelly beer. Light golden color, quickly diminishing foam. I'm surprised that this product contains hops. Has a hoppy, but a strange chaotic taste. Aftertaste is worse, because it's getting sour. But it wasn't that unpleasant for me. It was better than expected. But not good.

Van Pur Karpackie Pils;Warsaw, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Van Pur S.A.;0,5 can. Laza, nagy lyukú fehér hab, mely hamar oda lett... Színe testetlen világos-aranysárga. Illata inkább malátás, mintsem komlós pilseni, bár némi füvesség érződik. Szénsavassága közepesnél több, íze malátás, nagyüzemi, pici komló érződik. Nagy bátorság pilseninek nevezni magát... Iható, nem kiöntős, de nagyon alap nagyüzemi lager, nem különösebben ajánlom. Ahogy melegedett, nagyon büdös mellék-illat jött elő :(
Van Pur Karpackie Pils;Warsaw, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Van Pur S.A.;Clear straw-golden color with white head. Aroma of butter, some malt, bit hoppy. Flavor is bready, bit caramel, cardboard. Light body, easy to drink, nothing special.
Van Pur Karpackie Pils;Warsaw, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Van Pur S.A.;Can, 500 ml. It's a cheap Polish beer, no aromas, no taste, just a beer for watching football game. It looks OK, decent golden colour, head is staying for a while. Hay and faint sweet barley, totally featurless lager, no character, no anything u can discuss about. Watery palate, very faint taste of a bit of sweet malt, and a very very small amount of hops. Totally empty, dull cheap lager. Not a one to try again..

Max Amber;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Max Lager's;"The beer I had was called ""Amber Cream"" and may have been a different beer than this, but I’ll place this review here for now. Light clear amber pour, with a very light malt aroma and somne light hops. Light malty flavors, some woody hops. Light creamy mouthfeel. Came across a bit non-descript."
Max Amber;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Max Lager's;This was actually quite a tasty beer for an otherwise usually boring beer producer. Has some nice toasted malts and a bittersweet hoppy bite in the aftertaste which is a nice surprise. Nice caramel malt presence, with just a bit of a herbal vegetal taste in the finish.
Max Amber;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Max Lager's;This is one of those beers that you know you won’t rate about a four, but you have to admit that you really enjoyed. This is the quintessential session beer. Attractive color, it’s a true amber, and crystal clear, with a head that could pass for nitrogen dispensed if I didn’t know better. The aroma is slight - a little malt and a little hops. The flavor is perfectly balanced. There isn’t the chewy maltiness that is present in my top-ranked ambers that pushes them close into brown ale territory, but there is this nice clean caramel malt flavor, that enough to tease and keep you interested without being enough to tire you out after a few. The hops sneak up on you. I didn’t notice them at the first few sips, but as I drank, they grew and grew to the point that there was a distinct herb grapefruit peel hoppiness standing out and complementing the clean malt nicely. A beautiful little beer that I wouldn’t mind having more of.
Sweetwater Tavern Boot Hill Brown Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Draft at Sweetwater-Merrifield. From memory. Pours a dark brown/amber with white head. Very malty with a hint of chocolate. Good, but one dimensional.
Sweetwater Tavern Boot Hill Brown Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Deep amber pour with off white head and lace. Aroma of roasted malt, light chocolate, and earthy hops. Sour malt, toastiness, light chocolate, and a light bitter. Medium bodied and a tad fizzy for me.
Sweetwater Tavern Boot Hill Brown Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Light cola nose with bit of toffee. Taste is lightly sweet with some raisins and dark fruit, lots of caramel and a bit of roast at the end. Decent brown ale.
Sweetwater Tavern Boot Hill Brown Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Draft at Merrifield, VA location. Poured a relatively clear dark brown color with a medium sized white head. Aroma is roasted malts, touch of coca, earthy hops. Flavor is a great nutty one with notes of earthy hops, roasted malts. This was the highlight of the evening.
Sweetwater Tavern Boot Hill Brown Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Growler from the Sterling location. Pours coppery brown with a tall tan head. Aroma is hoppy, floral, and nutty with light cocoa and sweet malt. Some spicy hops come through as well. Taste is bigger nuttiness, spicy and earthy hops, cocoa, sweet malt and toasted notes. Body is light-medium and strongly carbonated, for a growler pour. Finishes with more cocoa, earthy hops, nutty flavors, toasted malts and light chocolate.
Sweetwater Tavern Boot Hill Brown Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);head doesn’t hold. nutty undertone, slight chocolate hint, more of a lager than an ale.
Sweetwater Tavern Boot Hill Brown Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);draft, middle of the road brown. Nutty but fairly unremarkable. A fairly generic brown beer.
Sweetwater Tavern Boot Hill Brown Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Draft... Sterling, VA location... Clear, copper ale with a mid-sized, creamy, khaki-colored head. Good retention with very thick lacing. Nutty, malty nose with subtle milk chocolate and piñons (pine nuts). Malty, chocolatey flavor, but perfectly-balanced. Medium-bodied and creamy with medium carbonation. Based on previous ratings, I’m thinking there have been improvements to the recipe... maybe more malt. Same frozen glass, though. Very nice brown ale.
Sweetwater Tavern Boot Hill Brown Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Had this on tap at the Sweetwater in Sterling VA. This came out looking a dark brown with a slight tan head with a bit of lace left about as it was drank. Aroma was of semi-sweet chocolate and nuttiness that mixed together over roasted malt. The taste was very similar to the nose with chocolate, nutty flavors and a roasted malt combine for a great flavor that is balanced out with a slight hop bitterness and coffee flavor at the end. One of the most flavorful Brown Ale’s I have had ever. Mouthfeel was good with a creamy medium body and good carbonation. With the great taste this never really got old and the only thing that might slow you down drinking these is the 6.4% alcohol.
Sweetwater Tavern Boot Hill Brown Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Red-brown body topped by healthy beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, nutty, chocolate, caramel, light roasty. Taste is mild sweet, nutty, chocolate, some roasty, light caramel, coffee, light cola, earthy, finishing with some anise. Watery light medium body. Iced glass may have contributed to the wateriness.

Hook Norton Hooky Dark (Cask);Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Mild Ale;Hook Norton Brewery;Cask @ Swansea Bay Beer Festival 2010. Dark chestnut brown-orange. Nice color but flat. Toasted butter and caramel aroma. Flavors are likewise toffee candy, caramel, and good dark sugar/gula melaka. Interesting study of how butteriness/diacetyl can be well-integrated to create those types of flavors rather than be a flaw.

Hook Norton Hooky Dark (Cask);Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Mild Ale;Hook Norton Brewery;Cask handpull at the brewery. Pale ruby with an off white collar. Red wine vinous and sourish with Ovaltine and biscuity malts softening the fruity edge. Quite a hefty dose of Marmite yeastiness, caramel and earth. Easy, quietly complex refreshment. Less of the red wine character next door at The Pear Tree, where it was brighter and more biscuit-accented. Tasty mild.
Selins Grove Dunkel Weizen;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Served on-tap at the brewpub. A - Pours deep brown with a fluffy one finger tall off white head leaving light lace down the glass. S - Smells of bready wheat, light spice, bananas, clove and bubblegum. Not much sweetness initially but it really revs up as it sits in the glass. T - Starts off with a bunch of chewy wheat slowly giving way to hints of bananas, spicy clove and bubblegum. The sweetness builds up as it comes to room temperature. Finish is a little chewy with some sweetness, lingering on the pallet for some time. M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Kinda chewy initially growing a little sweeter as it warms up in the glass. O - I enjoyed this one but I doubt I would drink more than one. After about half the glass it became a chore to finish.

Samuel Middleton Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;"From old tasting notes. Brewed by Wild Goose Brewery; Cambridge, Maryland. Hazy amber gold color. Big creamy beige head. Mild malty aroma. Pleasant toasted malt flavor is slightly dry, yet bittersweet as well. Soft dry finish. Faithful to the style, this pale ale rivals the Burton pale Ales from the UK, though it lacks their complexity. Overall, quite good."
Samuel Middleton Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Rather well pleased by this random choice found with a nice snack in Annapolis. While not a Pale to rave about, it was good enough that my girfriend was disappointed that she chose a Pilsner Urquel instead. Served in a cheap, flimsy plastic cup and it stil managed to let a fair malt body and decent hopping sally forth. Good beer.
Samuel Middleton Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;This is brewed by Fordham for Middleton’s Tavern in Annapolis. The beer has been around for years, and even bottled for a while, but brewed by a different company and using a Ringwood yeast. The latest incarnation is draft only and is a clean, bright APA with very balanced hop and malt flavors, with some strawberry notes apparent to me. A very easy drinker and enjoyable. Great head retention and clarity. But note that there is not a lot new here--you’ve had this beer before.

Bastone Main Street Pilsener;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bastone Brewery;More like a mild pale ale than a pilsner... but then, I don’t like pilsners, so that works. Slight pepper taste. Mildly dry-hopped. Minimal head. Yellow.
Bastone Main Street Pilsener;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bastone Brewery;Yellow gold color out of the tap with a thin white head. Light nose with some lemon notes. This is a good house beer to sell to people who do not know beer. There is a thin white sugar sweetness with some cracker and a lemon citrus flavor. Very lively on the tongue. Refreshing if standard brewpub pilsner.
Bastone Main Street Pilsener;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bastone Brewery;A bit too much diacetly here. No maltiness, not much hops, just kinda bland but not terible.

Bastone Main Street Pilsener;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bastone Brewery;Sample at the brewpub. Pours a clear yellow-gold color with a medium thin white head that recedes quickly. Spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of floral hops and grainy malt. Light body with flavors of mildly spicy hops, sweet malt and a bit of fruit. The finish is grassy and hoppy with a short mildly bitter aftertaste. Slightly above average overall.

Bastone Main Street Pilsener;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bastone Brewery;This bottled brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that was long lasting and left behind a transparent uncarbonated light yellow colored body and an excellent lacing. The weak aroma was malty. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of malt hops and mild astringency. An OK brew just nothing special.
Bastone Witface;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bastone Brewery;Served up on tap at the brewery or bar or abbey or whatever this place is trying to be. No head to be found. Hazy golden orange. Aroma is mild orange citrus without much assertiveness. Taste is more along the lines of watery orange and pineapple juice combination. Seems to be missing the spices of a witbier. Almost a thin sugar syrup quality. This is not recommended.
Bastone Witface;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bastone Brewery;Tap at brewery in royal oak during glbtq. Hazy gold with small white head. Slightly citrus nose. Some banana and clove elements. A little juicy. Not great mouthfeel. Below average wit.

Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20131122]
Bastone Witface;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bastone Brewery;It’s an unclear, yellow beer topped by an off-white head. The aroma is quite dusty and cellary, with some lemon and orange hints. Generic fruityness too. Quite dry on the palate, with quite a lot of carbonation and a solid dose of coriander. Citrus peel as well. Some maltyness and a little bitterness towards the end. Lacks quite a bit to become my favorite wit. 131122
Bastone Witface;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bastone Brewery;Pours cloudy pale lime yellow with small white head. Clear aroma of hops, yeast and coriander. Sourish, slightly perfumed flavour of yeast, flowers and citrus. Mildly rough and sourish aftertaste. OK but I have tasted better beers of this style.
Bastone Belgian Pale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bastone Brewery;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a murky orange color, somewhat brown, but not really. Finger’s worth of white foamy head sat atop and fell off at a decent pace. Mild stringy lace. The aroma had a floral hoppy output gracing some notes of lemon, banana, vanilla, raisin, and some woody to earthy dry/ sort of dustiness. The flavor was definitely pretty dry rubbing against the malty sweetness of the aromas. Dusty sort of earthy aftertaste and a clingy sort of dry leathery/grainy finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Sturdy carbonation. ABV felt fine. Overall, I can see it as a Belgian pale ale, and possibly one to come back to.
Bastone Belgian Pale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bastone Brewery;On tap, poured into a shaker. Sweet and floral aromas pour out of this one with notes of lemon, banana, vanilla, and dark woody spices. It pours a murky yellow brown color (classic belgian tripel look) with a foamy white head that reduces to a medium ring with a dusty surface. There’s no lace on the glass. The taste is a mellow, balanced medium level of sweet and bitter. It’s light, thin, and fizzy on the palate with flavors of lemon, banana, and clove. It’s clean, dry, and crisp with a light aftertaste.
Bastone Belgian Pale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bastone Brewery;On tap. (On special I believe). Surprisingly clear straw/gold color. Floral nose. Nice balance of hops and Belgian yeast. Very drinkable.
Bastone Belgian Pale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bastone Brewery;On tap: Lightly sweet aroma with even lighter hops. Slight hazey orangish-amber with a white head. Nice lacing. Lightly yeasty up front with a much stronger pine hop finish than I expected.
Bastone Belgian Pale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bastone Brewery;Slightly cloudy orange/yellow, lightly carbonated. Aromas of definite hops, mango (honestly), banana, sugars, slight malt. Strong hops in the flavor along with sweet fruits, citrus w/o sourness. Hops remains long into aftertaste.
Bastone Belgian Pale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bastone Brewery;Tap. Copper colored with a decent white head which leaves good lacing. Aroma is quite hoppy and a bit sour. Nice malt presence balanced out with a very big hop bitterness. Much more hop than I would expect from a true Belgian, but quite nice. Medium bodied. Pretty good.
Bastone Belgian Pale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bastone Brewery;Poured a cloudy peach color when poured into a pint glass. Maybe someone can explain to me why American brewpubs pour Belgian style ales into pint glasses. I just don’t get it. Anyways, the pale pours with a small egg shell colored head. Candy sugar and banana dominated the nose. Taste is lively and peppery with some notes of light banana, clove and slightly astringent. Mouthfeel is really lively. Brewed with Chimay yeast.
Bastone Belgian Pale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bastone Brewery;Nice orange transluscent color with good head. Estery yeast aroma, with little hop aroma. Descent malt flavor, a little Belgian yeast flavor, hop bitterness but not too much hop flavor, overall clean and tasty. I found it enjoyable, I didn’t expect a ton of hops, and I thought the hop/malt balance was good, but I would have liked a little more of the Belgian yeast character
Bastone Belgian Pale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bastone Brewery;2004 Draught. Moderately to heavily hazy. A warm orange with red tinges, slightly pale around the edges. Small white head, mostly disippating. Aroma has plenty of alpha hops, light belgian yeast. A light hint of toasty malt in the background, provides decent balance, but the hops are amazingly high in alpha content (cascades) and turns this in to a hybrid of an american pale and a belgian pale. Interesting, but I’m not sold yet, could use some more malt and yeast.
Bastone Dubbel Vision;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Dubbel;Bastone Brewery;Served from the brewery. Plum color with no head. Nor much aroma. Fruit light chocolate flavor. Medium heavy body. Basic dubbel. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bastone Dubbel Vision;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Dubbel;Bastone Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours ruddy cloudy light brown. Flavor is crisp dark malt with a touch of Belgian tartness.

Bastone Dubbel Vision;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Dubbel;Bastone Brewery;Taste on tap during Michigan Summer Beer Fest. Totally hazy brown, slight red color. Thin khaki head, some bits of lace. Solid dark fruit, some raisin, bit of toastiness. Touch of chocolate. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, kind of soft, sort of creamy lighter carbonation. Mild slick. Moderate-plus bitter taste, moderate sweet, nice balance to the taste. Just a bit of pleasant warmth on the end. A solid, tasty, balanced dubbel.
Bastone Dubbel Vision;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Dubbel;Bastone Brewery;Pours a dark brown with a thin white lacing. Aroma is lots of candi sugar, alcohol, and some dark fruits. Flavor is sweet candi sugar and dark fruits. Decent, though a bit heavy on the sugar.

Bastone Brown;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Bastone Brewery;Poured into a mug, the appearance was a semi-dark amber color with a half finger’s worth of white foamy head. Some messy lace. The aroma had some semi-spicy hops rolling over some toast, pomme-like fruit and then just a touch of vinous quality. The flavor blended a slight sour Belgian sort of taste to the sweet to spicy hops. Light banana and then some nuts. All seems to combine decently into the aftertaste and run on into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it, if one looks past some of the raw vinous quality almost coming out in an acidic manner. Carbonation seemed alright. Overall, was the acidic and vinous behavior of the aroma and flavor intentional? I’m not sure.
Bastone Brown;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Bastone Brewery;"Bottle acquired by, and thanks to footbalm, don’t ask me how but he has connections. Pours a dark mahogany color with a medium brown head. The aroma is very light; yeast, toasted malts, some fruit. The taste surprised me; sour vinous Belgian notes, some yeast, lots of sweet fruits, some banana and a odd very raw tasting malt. Some toasty and nutty flavors too. I’m not sure really, while I really enjoy this beer’s uniqueness it is very raw and has a very unclean feeling in the taste. I wonder about the ABV. However, overall it is really quite nice. A fizzy medium mouthfeel."
Bastone Brown;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Bastone Brewery;On tap at Bastone. Resembles a trappist style ale. Slight caramel, plum, and fruity notes throughtout. Full of flavor. Smooth.

Harviestoun Spring Fever;Alva, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;Tasted this at the Saltcot, Saltcoats (JDW) in May 2006. Cask, handpump dispense. Crystal clear pale golden straw in colour with a thin white head. Very aromatic with strong floral hop notes long in intensity. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives a digestive biscuit base with tart lemon zest present. Strong grassy hop resins impart a floral note in the aftertaste. Finish is citrusy with pithy dryness. An ok session Golden Ale but not for me.

Dillon Dam Yo Han Bock;Dillon, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Dillon Dam Brewery & Restaurant;Pretty good, that is my frist thought upon tasting this bock. Rich and creamy with some rich chocolate and sweet caramel, with a bit of nuttiness showing through as well. Some butterscotch, and other assorted bit of spiciness. This feel and tastes great. Well done!

Dillon Dam Yo Han Bock;Dillon, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Dillon Dam Brewery & Restaurant;very strong bock, but lacking flavor, this seems to be a trait of DAM brewery, cant say much about this one, a bit boring
Dillon Dam Chili Beer;Dillon, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Dillon Dam Brewery & Restaurant;Had this on tap at the Dam Brewery and Restaurant, the source. They apparently had made some changes to the recipe, though I don’t recall if I had tried it on any previous visits. But this was good. Great chili pepper aroma (which I can’t get enough of), served with a perperoncini in the glass, which made the appearance all the nicer. It had a lot of flavor without being over the top and the spiciness was distinct but also didn’t linger longer, which can happen sometimes. I like them either way, but this one not having that was a good thing. I would definitely order again.
Dillon Dam Chili Beer;Dillon, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Dillon Dam Brewery & Restaurant;Draft at the brewery served with a pepperoncini floating it.

Glenwood Canyon Heart Lake Dubbel;Glenwood Springs, Colorado, United States;Dubbel;Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company;Malty aroma on a dark golden beer. Very rich, alcohol-heavy, and sugary. Too much of the light sweetness, I’d think, to appeal to Belgian fans.

Aromas of flowers, dough, spice and honey. Tastes of sweet honey, a hint of wheat thins and spice. Light body, tingly carbonation, slippery mouthfeel and a cloyingly sweet, lightly spicy finish.

Light with a bit of orange and some coriander flavor at the back of the palate. Solid head! The flavor profile matches the style. Perfect for the summer because of the flavor but it has a solid full bodies mouthfeel that does not linger.

Tractor Brewing Farmer's Tan Red Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Tractor Brewing Company;Can from local Smith’s. What others have said.

Oh well, I’ll save the rest for driving off evil spirits when the relatives visit.

Sleeman Amber Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Single bottle purchased from a mom and pop shop in Calgary, AB on 05/04/2012. Colour: Light brown with creamy low white head. Nose: Hearty fusion on nut bread and burnt caramel. I really like how the malt plays here, outstanding. Taste: Medium-light sweet, light bitter, light sour. Again the malt works fantastic, producing lots of distinct grainy characteristics but without a sweet whiteout. Light vanilla is ever-present and the finish is lightly bitter but not astrigent. Big mass production breweries often get stepped upon for lack of consistency and quality, and deservedly so in some cases. This beer is an example of how things can go very right when the stars align. Great work on making a delicious amber Sleeman.
Sleeman Amber Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);341ml bottle pours a pale amber color with a finger of white head that settles to leave some thin spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild caramel with some light floral and citrus hops. Taste is light caramel malty sweetness with a moderate hoppy bitterness. Easy on the palate and a decent session beer, but nothing more than that.
Sleeman Amber Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Meilleure que la moyenne des amber ale. L’équilibre caramel/amertume est meilleur que dans plusieurs rousse comme la Keith mais pas aussi bien que celui de la Boréale. Un peu petillant pour mon goût. Rien de special mais c’est correct dans un bar.
Sleeman Amber Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Pours an amber color with a small dense off-white head, very clean and a huge amount of carbonation. Light citrus hops, strong floral, modest caramel, mild toasted malt late and some light metallic hints late. Toasted malt, smooth caramel early, smooth floral and sweet fruity apple, grape and orange middle, mild grainy and light metallic ending round out the flavors. Body is actually a decent density with a light dryness at the end and a slight fizzy feeling from the large amount of carbonation. Overall not a bad brew if you had it available around you. Sleeman has switched to clear bottles from the old classic brown bottles so I could see some variation of flavors floating around. Solid sweetness from the malt and hope really make this a pretty decent brew to drink.

Sleeman Amber Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Poured out a nice clear mid-range brown with an off white bubbly crown and consistently left minimal ropy lacing. The aroma was weak but for a widely available beer its just different enough to appeal to someone venturing out from the mass produced sort. Slight caramel, light caramel and roasted malts with grains. The taste is weak caramel that is blended near equal to the hops. Some sweetness. It doesn’t come across all that smooth with a sort of fluffy carbonation feel and it was more bitter than I had expected from a Sleemans product (cool). Gets ’er done but is nowhere near the flavour factories on the west coast US pumping out ambers that water the mouth.
Sleeman Amber Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Bottle. Amber pour. No head. Aroma is citrus and some mild hops. Flavor is water. Very thin and poor.

Sleeman Amber Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Bottle: Amber color,weal heading, weal lace, no off tastes. Weak mouth feel, some fruits and stale malt presence over attenuated hopping, fast finish... clean and fizzy. A dollar beer tarted up in a premium package...but not premium taste.
Sleeman Amber Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Decent Flavour. Slightly sweet malt flavour. Overall its an okay beer and I would probably get this one again.

Trap Rock Ghost Pony Light;Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Trap Rock Brewery;Crisp and fruity, not bad for a light beer. It’s still a light beer though, so I couldn’t really go any higher with the numbers.

Trap Rock Ghost Pony Light;Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Trap Rock Brewery;I had the pleasure of eating and drinking at Trap Rock on a business trip (and believe me, this place was great..it even made all the rude Jersey assholes seem insignificant). This is the finest light beer I have ever had. It pours pale yellow (no surprise there), with a malt and citrus aroma. The taste was very malty, sweet, and with a smooth, almost honeyish finish. A fuller bodied, sweeter light beer. Excellent.

Trap Rock Six Witches Dry Stout;Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Dry;Trap Rock Brewery;Clearish, close to black stout topped by a lasting and sticky brown head. A rather smoky nose where pumpernickel breadiness shows amidst the grainy roast and coffee laden flavours. Timid acidity remains drowned by the black malts’ roast. Balanced and tasty, not anywhere too sweet. Medium bodied, average carbonation. Good stuff, just greatly executed.
Trap Rock Six Witches Dry Stout;Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Dry;Trap Rock Brewery;on tap -pours a retaining light brown head and black color.

Trap Rock JP Lager;Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Trap Rock Brewery;"Trap Rock actually named this beer after a patron with the intials JP. I met him, and he was filling up a cooler full of three growlers, and he was a hell of a nice guy. I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Trap Rock describes it as a ""lighter maibock"", and it pours dark straw with a good head. Aroma of malt, red wine, and sweet grape juice. Tastes very malty, with a fruity, sweet, slightly hoppy, smooth finish. Very complex. I’ve never had a beer like this one, and I was very impressed with this one."

The aroma is banana esters, clove, wheat, all the trademark aromas for the style. The taste is very strong on the banana, wow, it tastes like a piece of banana taffy, very interesting. The body is full, carbonation is medium. Overall I was impressed with this one, that flavor is very drinkable and unique. Half way through the glass I started detecting sour notes in the taste, so the taste drops from an 8 to a 7, the overall drops from a 16 to a 13, this beer did not finish well.

Iceni The Wright Stuff;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Iceni Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. The boys were recommending it strongly from the minute I walked in but on ended in me being stitched right up. This beer looked like a pint of Fairy Liquid (that’s UK washing up liquid. It was bright fluorescent green, with a sudsy, bubbly head. Fucking awful to look at and it wasn’t even Saint Patrick’s Day. Closing my eyes and trying to be objective the beer was still awful. No real flavour to comment on. Word was that the beer was meant to be blue, but blue and yellow give green so I think there was some sort of miscalculation along the way.

Steelhead Terrapin Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Good beer but not really an IPA. There is so much malt that I would classify this more as an Amber? Either way its good. Bold Centennial hop aroma is citrusy and a bit spicy. Plenty of caramel in there to balance the malt. Very flavorful and aromatic brew here. Quite complex, there’s a lot going on. Medium bodied with lingering bitter finish.
Steelhead Terrapin Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;I would not exactly call this an IPA, more of a beefed up APA, but has a substantial malt background that tastes like a steelhead beer. Nutty, with some light fruits shining through with a subtle but lingering hop tinge, that is just unbalanced. Too bad the beers just are not what they used to be since Jaime left.

Walkerville Superior Light;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Walkerville Brewing Company;I did not like this beer at all. A very pale orangy-gold colour with very little head. The aroma is slightly skunky with a lot of off notes. The flavour was a mish-mash of malt, hop, and sour vegetables. A pretty poor effort for a light beer.
Walkerville Superior Light;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Walkerville Brewing Company;341 ml bottle (from dusty 6 pack at Crossroads LCBO... wonder how long this one has been sitting around). Pours a very lightly cloudy yellowish golden colour with thin white head. Aroma has lots of caramel malt, grains and a bit of sourness. Flavour has identical profile. Body is lightish but not too bad for 3.9%. So so but better than I’d anticipated.
Walkerville Superior Light;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Walkerville Brewing Company;Another Ontario pale lager, Joy!! very vegetal, corny aroma. Flavour is much of the same. Not really any hops to speak of, slight maltiness, but nothing more. Meh, very passable beer.
Walkerville Superior Light;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Walkerville Brewing Company;bottle: Thanks to Lord Beamish for this from his pilgrimage to Walkerville Brewery. Again, he hits the nail on the head: for a LIGHT beer, this is superior (as the label boldly declaires). Are all the reviewers here mad? It is a light beer, of course it will lack some flavour, but it has way more flavour than any light beer I’ve ever had! Just enough hops bite and some famous Walkerville sweet malts to really round out the flavour. Thiis is the best light beer I’ve ever had & isn’t that bad compared to normal beers. Comparing this to a full bodied ale or bitter is just missing the whole point.
Walkerville Superior Light;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Walkerville Brewing Company;bottle: I picked one of these up direct from the factory in Windsor, Ontario. It’s a bold move to call your beer ’superior’ but when you produce award winning beers like Walkerville, you can justify the name choice. This is clearly superior to any light beer on the market. Having said that.....it’s still a light beer. Pours a beautiful deep golden colour with a thin white head. Some lacing is evident. It looks delicious. A sweet hops aroma leads to a pleasant mouth feel. Tastes somewhat sweet and finishes silky smooth. Surprising body for a light beer. This tastes very similar to its big brother beer, Walkerville Premium Blonde. Why everyone is roasting it remains a mystery to me. Maybe Walkerville doesn’t run enough commercials of scantily clad women or run a Maxim Golf Tournament like another light brand I know. Bizzare.
Walkerville Superior Light;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Walkerville Brewing Company;A lightly veeled blonde lager with a thin lacing white head. Light caramel adjuct aroma, boiled corn. In mouth, a light chlaky malt taste, no hops, light and innoffensive. Malty mineral water.
Walkerville Superior Light;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Walkerville Brewing Company;[111-20061121] 341mL. Musty, slightly burnt aroma. Clear, light orange body with many fast-rising tiny bubbles throughout and a quick foamy white head. Bready fish flavour with a light metal and slightly slate watery quality. Tingly tongue feeling but nothing important. Not terrible but not good either.
Walkerville Superior Light;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Walkerville Brewing Company;"Apparently, Walkerville was known for its beer quality around the turn of the century. Okay... They claim no adjuncts as well, but I detect distinct corny notes. A bit of grass and much malt for a lite beer in the nose; flavour-wise the sweetness is very apparent right off the bat, weak body and some astringency in the finish. Gets points for appearance: golden yellow with decent head and even a touch of lacing. But the imbalance and thinness make it an unpleasant drink overall."
Walkerville Superior Light;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Walkerville Brewing Company;Extremely light in colour and body. Not much to it in terms of variety of taste. Very distinct smell, hops, grassy undertones and malt. It claims to have yeast as well, but it’s not very prevalent. Overall a very weak beer that is slightly more interesting then it’s mainsteam counterparts (Budweiser and the like)
Walkerville Superior Light;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Walkerville Brewing Company;For a light beer this ain’t too bad. I really like their lager and found this one to be, not a water-down version, but more of the economy version. The flavors aren’t as robust or distinct and some off flavors and aromas have snuck in. Fairly good body and nice light bitterness and a clean finish. Cheers!
Wyre Piddle Piddle Down Under;Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wyre Piddle;A Mes rate. Cask at the Wenlock. Nice rich amber colour with no head what so ever. It does actually smell of wee. Not sure if the name is influencing me but it never has done with Wyre Piddle before. Oily and almost fatty in the mouth. Bitter finish. Pretty crap.
Wyre Piddle Piddle Down Under;Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wyre Piddle;Cask Conditioned at The Boat, Offenham. Pale amber with weak head. This is a thin malty beer with a little nutty character, dryish but lacking overall depth. Short harsh finish.
Caseys Cream Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;Draught. Originally rated on 20110121. Pours hazy copper color with a medium sized steady head. Aroma of malts, hay, some mild toffee and faint hops. Flavor of malts, mild fruits and caramel. Smooth fruity palate.
Caseys Cream Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;Draught @ O’Connell’s, Tampere. Rated on 17.03.2010 Aroma is rather light with some hay, toffee and caramel. Flavour has toffee, some English hops, hay and biscuits. Easy‐going, straightforward and easy to forget. I thought I was finally going to have my first cream ale, but then I noticed this was listed as a bitter…

Caseys Cream Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;Mild aroma of toffeish-malts and lemon. Same unpleasant lemon dominates malty flavor. Thin body.
Caseys Cream Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;Keg (O’Connells, Tampere) Dark copper, tight keggy head. Tasted like the finish of the previous beer I’d had, which was about half an hour earlier. Fleeting hint of sweet malt. I think. Better than the tapwater because it has less flavour.
Caseys Cream Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;"Dark coppery colored, slightly cloudy appearance. Medium sized white head. Sweet, mildly roasted toffee aroma, let’s say noticable ""Irish Smithwicks""-aroma, though this comes from England. Thin to medium bodied. Flavor has also toffee with mild licorice even, same creamy tone also in flavor. Drying aftertaste with slight caramel."
Caseys Cream Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;"Draught. Copper coloured, caffrey’slike huge white creamy head. After ""settling a few minutes"" it is still big and creamy, and the creamy head lasts until the beer ends. Fruity aroma with hints of hops and also some caramellishlike hints. Fruity and caramellish flavour. It’s very sweet also. Hoppy and fruity aftertaste. Good carboration and pleasant in most ways."
Caseys Cream Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;Draught Clear nut brown, mahogany. Perfect off-white creamy and steady head. Mild aroma, a bit soapy, weak coffee. Light to medium bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Not much roast - watery. Quite similar to Kilkenny but thinner and weaker mouthfeel. (3/4/6/4/10 2.7) Re-rated draught Nut brown, flowery nose. Light-bodied but a good amount of flowery Goldings hops is present. Totally different than in my first sample - it was Irish Ale, this was more like a bitter. (6/3/6/3/12 3.0)
Wye Valley Forgemans Mild;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Mild Ale;Wye Valley Brewery;Cask Conditioned at The Fleece, Bretforten, Worcs. Dark brown with red hue, regulation bubbly head. May the 8th ’04 was national mild day and this didn’t let us down, higher abv than most milds this was an easy drinking fruity apply mild with a background nuttiness and chocolatey malt. A lasting sumptuous bitterness completes a pretty good mild. The pub, owned by The National Trust, had a recent devestating fire in the thatch, it is going to be rebuilt and the nation should be thankfull because this is a classic country pub. The beer is being served in the barn at the moment which in itself is a beautiful building. The whole package is a delight, please support it.
Baeren Maibock;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baeren;Bottle from Tanakaya. Pours a slightly hazy gold with 2 fingers of head. Biscuit malty nose with honey and some peach notes. Fairly one-dimensional but still really enjoyable. More honey as it warms. Finish is sweet and malty. Nice enough for the style. I enjoyed this.
Baeren Maibock;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baeren;Bottle, thanks to TimE, 04/11/2015. Pours a cloudy golden orange, thin white head fades quickly. Aroma of soft bready malts and dry straw, mild honey notes and faint fruit. Taste is sweet cereal grains with toasted bread, spicy herbal hops. Light medium body, nice carbonation. Decent brew.
Baeren Maibock;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baeren;Bottle. Helles malt and softness, light grassy hops but the extra booze gives it a bit of a creamy feel somehow. Light funkiness which I like. Not sure if it is supposed to be there. Honey and fruit. I like it.
Baeren Maibock;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baeren;This bottle was brewed on my birthday which was a nice surprise. 6.5% bottle from the brewery via Rakuten. Anniversary 3-pack. It pours a dark gold with a quickly dissipating head. Nice sweet malt aroma. Rich thick malty sweet body, kind of one dimensional but good. Dry mild bitter finish. Reminds me of a golden ale I had yesterday... but it is better.
Baeren Maibock;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baeren;Botella at a family/friends Golden Week gathering in Obatake. Nice deep golden colour with a big white head, steady, good lacing. Sweet nice fruity hoppy malty caramel pleasant aroma. Good mouthfeel indee3d. Flavour of toastish malt with nicely fruity hops and caramel, good above medium bitterness. Nice!
Baeren Maibock;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baeren;Bottled. Lightly hazy golden, small head. Aroma of bread and butter.

Baeren Maibock;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baeren;Big white head. Sweet malty arom with some wheat caractair. Taste is malty with a big body and a litle warming alcohol. A realy good bock.
Baeren Maibock;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baeren;"Tap at Q-Brick. Fruity malt aroma with peaches, oranges, and honey. Rich malt flavor, with the same fruits as in the nose. Hoppy, with a rather bitter finish. Nice contrast between hops and fruits; good balance. Pleasant and flavorful, but nothing at all like a traditional maibock. Tastes like a strong blonde ale."
Baeren Maibock;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baeren;"My Bottom Line: This Heller Bock is able to offer as much fruity honey sweetness as grassy hop bitterness, all in a crisp and delicate vehicle. Another good German-style creation from Baeren! Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the hazy honeyed blond. -Sweet cereals are cooked up into a spicy bread. -Hops are also herbal and quite authentic. -The soft effervescence pushes all flavors onwards. -Alcohol is not a factor in the flavor profile. Bottle; thx Tim!"
Baeren Maibock;Morioka, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baeren;I looked at the ratings before, I had this beer and didn’t have much expectations. WOW, nice surprise to say the least. Deep golden color with a fruity nose of apricots, strawberries. Fully body of apricots, strawberries and oranges. Rich malty finish with a lingering orange taste. Tried six years after the original rating and it isn’t quit as good as what it once was. Still not a bad brew, but just above average and lacking depth.

Rohrbach McDermott's Irish Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Rohrbach Brewing Company;McDermott’s Irish Red is a crystal clear amber ale with a fine, dense, off-white head that leaves good lacing. It has a slightly sweet, malty aroma. There’s a touch of resin in the nose and maybe something slightly umami. It has a very smooth medium body with a clean crisp finish. It’s slightly sweet, a little roasty and a little resiny. It’s a nice focus on the malt, but there is enough mellow bitterness to balance it out. It’s so drinkable. I could chug this entire growler, but I have to go to work in the morning. Alas.
Rohrbach McDermott's Irish Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Draft at Buffalo Rd. brewpub. Pours brown with a thin off white head.

Aroma is very smoky and malty with a lot of earthy notes as well. Flavor is very smoky right at the beginning and carries all the way through. Underneath all the smoke and roasted malts is a lightly sweet malt touch and a quickly disappearing finish. Nothing all that special.
Rohrbach McDermott's Irish Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Poured a small head on this one. Reddish when holding it up to the light. Not up to par with some other Irish beers. What is that gritty stuff in there?
Rohrbach McDermott's Irish Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Was rather surprised to find this different Irish Ale than the previous one I tried here. This one was quite different than the light fluffy Flaherty’s. The buzzword here is ’malt.’ Little head, but very nice brown with reddish highlights. Low aroma, very high malt palate, gritty.

Big Dog's Tailwagger Wheat;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Dog's Brewing Company;Sample 4/4 at Yard House, Las Vegas. Pours cloudy yellow with a thin, off-white head. The aroma contains banana, wheat, citrus and very little clove. It tastes light sour, medium bitter and medium sweet with a dry, astringent finish that has some spice in it. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation (too much). Palate ruins the experience somewhat, whilst the taste is all over the place...
Big Dog's Tailwagger Wheat;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Dog's Brewing Company;On tap. Pours a cloudy orange-yellow with a thin, white head that laces. Sweet aroma of wheat malt, banana, bubble gum and yeast. Tart flavour of wheat malt, lemon zest, grass and clove with a crisp, dry finish. Light body with a watery texture and soft carbonation. Disappointing.

Big Dog's Tailwagger Wheat;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Dog's Brewing Company;(bomber from Sparky, thanks E!) Pretty warm out on this 11th of June, so I figured a hefe would be a good drink for the evening. Pours a very cloudy light yellow-orangish color with a medium white head that settles to a thin white cap. Aroma holds a rich cornucopia of scents, with some creamed corn, big time wheat bread, must, more wheat bread, mineral water, lemon zest, and more wheat bread. There is no trace of the banana or clove in my estimation. Flavor holds more of the Mendota Springs mineral water with lemon flavor, some more bread, and a glimmer of sweetness towards the finish that has a faint trace of Cream of Wheat with dried banana chips and vanilla. Finish snaps pretty good and is quite refreshing. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, but it could stand to use a little more carb. The creaminess is one feature of this beer that is present which I seek in the style. Overall this is a decent hefe, but it needs some work in the aroma.
Big Dog's Tailwagger Wheat;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Dog's Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy yellow with a head of huge bubbles that quickly dissipate... not impressed. Aroma is faint but pleasant: caramel, hay, floral, grass, light citrus, some dough, light butterscotch. The smell is the best part of this beer IMHO. Flavor grew on me as I drank more (I’m up grading the flavor rating as I type): Medium sweet, very little bitterness, and medium sour, quite enjoyable. A slick light to medium bodied palate with an abrupt lightly bitter finish. Probably wouldn’t go out of my way to purchase again BUT wouldn’t mind drinking it when in the mood for a Hef’ and pickings are slim.
Big Dog's Black Lab Stout;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Stout;Big Dog's Brewing Company;On tap at Big Dog’s. Pour a deep brown color with tan creamy head. Aroma of malt, bit of grain and coffee.

Big Dog's Black Lab Stout;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Stout;Big Dog's Brewing Company;Ah, the good beer of the night. The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a bar pour’s thin white head. Light lacing does trickle a tad. The smell had a light roasty quality with a tad of light coffee. The taste was semi-roasty with a touch of caramel and light chocolate. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body. It’s somewhat sessionable. The carbonation was somewhat harsh but not overbearing. Overall, good stout I’d have again. It saved me from that cranberry beer I had before.
Big Dog's Black Lab Stout;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Stout;Big Dog's Brewing Company;Had to try this because I had a black lab for several years. Great dog, pretty good beer. It is very dark in color, with roasted, coffee-like malt with a dry finish. Rich, full head and nice aroma.

Big Dog's Black Lab Stout;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Stout;Big Dog's Brewing Company;Nice malt aroma and a big brown head. Beer had big body and excellent roasted, coffee taste. Beer is nitrogen carbonated giving it that typical Guiness type mouthfeel. Best of the beers I tried.
Big Dog's Black Lab Stout;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Stout;Big Dog's Brewing Company;"Sampler at Big Dog’s Brewery. Nice dark color, slight roast and coco in the sip. Too watery for me throught the sip for this style. I would have guessed ""Porter"" on a blind test."

Big Dog's Leglifter Light;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Dog's Brewing Company;On tap At the Draft House. Served a light golden color with a small head and bits of lacing. Mild aroma of citrus and fresh grain. Taste has a mild sweetness with fresh grain. Trace of bitterness and a clean finish. Light body, crisp, smooth and somewhat refreshing. Easy drinker. Not a beer that I would go out of my way for, but my wife enjoyed it. At least it has a leg up on the BMC offerings
Big Dog's Leglifter Light;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Dog's Brewing Company;Light yellow cleaar colour. Nearly no aroma, with a very weak head. Very borring and very little taste indeed.
Big Dog's Leglifter Light;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Dog's Brewing Company;I think this is the worst beer I’ve ever had. Water with lemon has more body and taste than this beer. Small floral hop was the only thing that separated this from water. Non-existent carbonation only frustrated me more. Save the dough.

Big Dog's Leglifter Light;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Dog's Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. I hate to rate such a low rating for a small brewery but I don’t have a choice on this one. The worst part about it was the over carbonated sour/stinky taste. I didn’t finish my sample glass which says a lot about my opinion since I NEVER waste beer unless I don’t have a choice. Sorry Big Dogs but I can’t stand this one.
Big Dog's Leglifter Light;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Dog's Brewing Company;On tap. Pours with a near water hue. No head. Aroma of corn, light grain and cigarette from the bozo next to me. Taste is water, light sweet fruit and no hops (tastes like an actual lack of hops). Surprisingly unoffensive. Really thin and fizzy.

Tenaya Creek Centennial Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tenaya Creek Brewery;"Very middle of the road ... malty/biscuity with a white head that stays as a filmy top. Sweet finish. Not at all an ""amber"" lager, but pretty good drinker, like all of them at Tenaya."

Light-bodied with a very creamy mouthfeel and pillow-soft carbonation. Short, lightly bitter finish. World class beer!

Deep Creek Angry Clown Brown Ale;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Deep Creek Brewing Company;This red muddy brown ale had a loose but lingering head. The aroma was that of a nice smooth nut brown ale, and the taste didn’t disappoint. Woody and complex, worth sinking your teeth into.

Royal Pilsner;Faxe, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Royal Unibrew;Simple mart on Wuxing. Nose is nondescript. Looks the part tho. Very basic pilsner. Clean and crisp, yet watery. I can't draw out many more adjectives or flavours. Basic lager, but good on a hot day.
Royal Pilsner;Faxe, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Royal Unibrew;On tap, it looks OK, golden with a fast-settling head, smell is sweet, a little malt and corn, then it's thin and dusty-sweet, vaguely beery in a Lite Lager sort of way. At least it's wet.
Royal Pilsner;Faxe, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Royal Unibrew;A small can from Simplemart. A more watery version of the Export. This makes Carlsberg taste good. Thumbs down.
Royal Pilsner;Faxe, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Royal Unibrew;Bought a bottle of this Royal Pilsner in Denmark. Thin and malty. Clear and golden. Nothing interesting at all !
Royal Pilsner;Faxe, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Royal Unibrew;Can. Aroma is herbal starchy something. Taste is a little sweet with not much taste. Light herbal aftertaste. Boring old pils.
Royal Pilsner;Faxe, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Royal Unibrew;Cold 500ml serving in a tumbler at a bar in Nyhavn, Copenhagen. Appearance is amber-gold, with a few bubbles and one finger of off-white fluffy head. Crystal clear. The head remains as a thiner layer for most of the drink. A very limited selection of beer at what was really a cocktail bar. No much in terms of aroma. Some limited malt. A little hay. The taste is just as limited. Some slight malt, as the drink warms some caramel flavour becomes apparent. A little bitterness. Corn is ever present. Watery mouthfeel. Corn. A touch of bitterness. Does away and is forgotten very quickly. Some limited lacing on the glass. As the drink went down I noticed the glass was branded with ingredients listed on it. Though I’m not fluent in Danish I’m pretty sure corn is one of them. Meh. It is what it is. You might as well just drink water.

Oily mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Lengthy, smooth, strawy finish. Me likes!
Deep Creek Golden Ale;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Deep Creek Brewing Company;"Their best brew, according to the bartender. Nice hops. Better than most ""golden ales"", actually has a little complexity. Easy start and finish, a good drinking beer"

Deep Creek Dauphine Street Dunkel Weizen;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Deep Creek Brewing Company;Murky, dark amber lager with a large, fizzy, off-white head.

Lengthy, crisp, tangy finish.
Deep Creek Dauphine Street Dunkel Weizen;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Deep Creek Brewing Company;The banana and clove flavor and aroma is the first thing that stikes you (German yeast strain typical of dunkelweizens used). One will also notice the heavy malt flavor compared to the light hopping. This beer has a complex taste and is very different. Definetly one to try.
Deep Creek Storm Peak Stout;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Stout;Deep Creek Brewing Company;Pitch black with a very thick, creamy, well-tanned head. Terrific retention and great cumulus lacework.

Deep Creek White Dog Wheat;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Wheat Ale;Deep Creek Brewing Company;Hazy, straw-colored lager with a mid-sized, fizzy, white head. The nose is a bit yeasty/soapy and citrusy. Very refreshing flavor, but a tad thin. Nicely hopped... just a touch on the bitter side. Citrus and floral flavors. Light-bodied with a fizzy mouthfeel. Short, crisp, clean finish. Very refreshing Summer brew!
Deep Creek White Dog Wheat;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Wheat Ale;Deep Creek Brewing Company;"From the appearance (white/gold, hazy, fluffy head and lacing) and the aroma (herbal, clove), I would’ve guessed it was a Wit? Palate was very soft and smooth, not thick, but full of flavor. Lemon, banana, fruity, cloves; this was a really good summer beer!"

Fair enough.
Wittinger Premium;Wittingen, Lower Saxony, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Wittingen;Draught 0.3 litre into a lovely flute at the brewery stand in Berlin’s 2014 Green Week: two years ago I had their Stackmanns Dunkel, this year their Premium was chosen. Typical and usual German Pilsner look: golden, bright, clear and clean. The head a non-staying white crown. Slight grainy, malty nose. Crisp feel to the taste, flavour wise it’s weak, a little sweeter than some but nothing out of the ordinary. A bit of a disappointment to be honest, I was surrounded by brewery bars and headed for this one because it looked interesting and I remembered their Dunkel being OK. Just below Mr Average in almost all aspects.

Royal Classic;Faxe, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Royal Unibrew;The first local beer I have tried on a trip to Copenhagen. The delivery is nice in their prescribed Royal tulip glass, copper in color with a skim of light tan foam. It has the generic beer scent, grain, rice and a bit of hops. And the taste is decent, cereal, lightly malty, a touch of caramel and water. Not rewriting the book on beer but certainly not bad.

Mudshark Pub Draft ESB;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mudshark Brewing Company;Have you ever wanted a beer to make someone change from budlight to real beer... small batch beer? This is the step better than bud light but with a little better flavor... not to bad.
Mudshark Pub Draft ESB;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mudshark Brewing Company;On tap @ Mudshark poured a clear dark reddish amber with a lasting amber head. Aromas of carmel, toffee and light earthiness. Palate was light bodied and dry. Flavors of carmel, toffee, earthiness and a hint of pine with a dry bitter finish.
Mudshark Forever Green IPA;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;IPA;Mudshark Brewing Company;average ipa....nice cloudy copper color, but not that interesting for an ipa....and a bit cloying in the finish
Mudshark Forever Green IPA;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;IPA;Mudshark Brewing Company;on draft: nice golden yellow brown. with white head. nose is hops and piney citrus. medium bodied hops and malt well balanced. not really an ipa to my standards, more of a pale ale. however, many have tried to push the hop limits with the ipa thing, probably moving the category to higher expectations or broadening the margins. never the less, a good beer. easy to drink and refreshing.
Banks Legends Export;Christchurch, Barbados;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Banks Barbados Brewery;Light orange colored beer with an insignificant white head. Weak grass aromas with some cereal. Flavor is also week, some corn sweetness and also sourness. Watery body and low carbonation.
Banks Legends Export;Christchurch, Barbados;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Banks Barbados Brewery;Historical rating, bottle - source not noted. Pale gold colour with white head, aroma of grass and hops. Fairly high in carbonation, medium sweetness. Disappointing really.
Banks Legends Export;Christchurch, Barbados;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Banks Barbados Brewery;(Retrospective rate) 330ml bottle. Catty, watery, thin, harsh tasting. Poor.
Banks Legends Export;Christchurch, Barbados;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Banks Barbados Brewery;"Süßer und leicht künstlicher Geruch. Auch der Antrunk ist so gestrickt, komisch künstlich, etwas süß, nicht wirklich lecker. Im Mittelteil etwas ""normaler"", leicht hopfig, weniger süß. Im Abgang wird das Ganze dann noch milder, was zu einer deutlichen Aromenschwöche führt, der Hopfen führt ein schwaches Untergrund-dasein. Schwache Leistung.

Banks Legends Export;Christchurch, Barbados;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Banks Barbados Brewery;Bottle@Home. Malty, light fruity, herbal hops. Small beige head, yellow colour, hazy, good lace. Sweet, light bitter, light fruity, some yeast. Medium body for a lager. Refreshing, interesting.
Banks Legends Export;Christchurch, Barbados;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Banks Barbados Brewery;Bottled, pasteurised, 330ml from Beers of Europe, Norfolk. Pale yellow gold with CO2 head. A pretty faithful copy of the original, drunk at the same time, but how difficult is it to copy a pale, sweet malt lager. There is a little less hop impact and just a touch more of the corn, vanilla note. It loses to the original, but only just.
Banks Legends Export;Christchurch, Barbados;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Banks Barbados Brewery;Pours a fizzy yellow. Aromas of grains, mild hops, with a little skunk. Flavor is crisp, and taste like it smells.

Gwada Ambrée (-2009);Baie-Mahault, Guadeloupe;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gwada (Les Brasseurs de Guadeloupe);My research before departing to the Caribbean for a six week holiday suggested that this would be to only beer I would find that was not a bland lager or a stout, so I was very keen to try it. But my efforts in Guadeloupe drew a blank and a phone call to the brewer foundered on language difficulties, so I resigned myself to missing out. However, when I went into a shop in the airport departure lounge there, in the fridge, was Gwada Ambree (and Gwada Rhum q.v.). Well, it’s not the finest beer I’ve ever had but, in comparison to what I had had to put up with before, it was very welcome. Filtered, but not pasteurised. Clean and fresh, with some malt and a subtle hop presence. A good effort.
Mad Anthony Plum Porter;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;A dark brown body with a light tan head and wonderful lacing. Malty aroma with some plum hints. A typical porter malty bitter taste, but there was a sour plum taste as well. Also a dry finish.

Byron Bay Premium Ale;Byron Bay, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Byron Bay Beverages (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);On tap at Byron Bay, pours a clear pale yellow with a small white head. Aroma brings out biscuity malt and not much else. Flavour is boring, with biscuity malt and maybe a smidgeon of hops. Pointless creation. Clean enough but barely different from water.
Byron Bay Premium Ale;Byron Bay, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Byron Bay Beverages (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Very light fruity citrus aroma. Clear golden colour with excellent head. Malty up front with smooth toffee middle and a dry hop finish. Medium body with low carbonation.

Byron Bay Premium Ale;Byron Bay, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Byron Bay Beverages (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle 330ml. Not bad, nice and malty. Aromas of honey and leaves. Taste is sweet, with light bitterness. Palate is oily, and medium bodied. Dark yellow, with a thin head.
Byron Bay Premium Ale;Byron Bay, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Byron Bay Beverages (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);0.33l bottle from fridge. clear amber golden, with no head at all. lots of sweetness for a lager, very little mouthfeel (not very carbonated). aroma of roasted cereal and malt, with a lot of sweetness, and mild bitterness.
Byron Bay Premium Ale;Byron Bay, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Byron Bay Beverages (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);poured a brilliant gold with minimal head, slight sweet aroma, medium bitterness and a little bit sweet. very boring beer, i got this in a boutique beer pack for valentines off the wife, firstly the fact that this beer is considered boutique scares me, the only thing premium about this ale is the name and the price, if i wanted a bland macro lager i could drink one the mega brands for a lot cheaper.
Byron Bay Premium Ale;Byron Bay, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Byron Bay Beverages (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Quite heady, cow-pat hay and gritted, cereal grain on the nose, stings of salt. Looks good but oddly manufactured, orange amber and bright with a resilient head of foam that sheens and is fuelled by a violent melee of rising carbonation. Flabby, doughy, sweet, biscuity malt palate, woody tale end hinting at burnt caramel. Very nutty, sweet like pecan pie filling, a subdued marzipan note that doesn’t quite suit. Licks at vanillin too, in fact it tastes like a half-baked leavened nut slice. No hops to match, no depth to balance, and an overall soapy mouthfeel. Not one I’d say refreshes, seems halfway there to a decent beer. Pretty ordinary! (33cL, 26/11/10, Dan Murphy’s)
Byron Bay Premium Ale;Byron Bay, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Byron Bay Beverages (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"not a good beer at all. would not consider this ""premium"" at all. tourist trap in a bottle (brewed in sydney, not byron)"
Byron Bay Premium Ale;Byron Bay, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Byron Bay Beverages (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I’m sorry I don’t know all the terms, but this is a drinkable little drop with a charming balance of malt and hops. Aroma is negligible, but the bold hop first taste is friendly without being forward. Do I have to smell a beer before I take a sip? ...no. And the finish is sweet but definitely charming, putting one in mind of Russel Crowe (at least IMHO). But please do not call this an ale. This is a highly competent lager, comparable to Bluetongue lager. A lovely companist to a meat pie, a Thai red curry, or souvlaki. The first taste is friendly, and the friendship remains with one for a very long and pleasant time.
Sequoia Baseball Nut;Fresno, California, United States;Brown Ale;Sequoia Brewing Company;On draught. Tasted during trip to California. Reddish brown colour. Good aroma of some sweet and fruity. Great taste of roasted malt caramel and it’s end up lovely hoppy and bitter, some nutty in the aftertaste.

Pizza Port Palisade Pale Ale;Carlsbad, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Honey colored body with a tight small cream head that left beautiful lacing all down the glass. Soft resiny funk in the nose. Floral, earthy, and fresh. Fairly dry with a smooth mouthfeel. Firm soft bitterness on the sides of the tounge. A touch of earthy funk with a very subdued biscuty maltieness that becomes more prevalent as it warms. Finishes with fresh bread and hops.
Pizza Port Palisade Pale Ale;Carlsbad, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);"(Draft: O’Brien’s in San Diego, CA) A hops dominated pale ale; Quite hoppy and bitter, especially in the finish; Some kind of weird vegetable-like hoppiness going on and something just tastes a little off; I guess I don’t much care for the new Palisade hops; Fairly malty and mildly smoky early on; Not much aroma; Amber in color; Off white head leaves a nice blanket of lacing"
Pizza Port Palisade Pale Ale;Carlsbad, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);This pale ale pours with an orange-amber body topped by a thick head with a good amount of lacing. The aroma is slightly sweet, grapefruity and hoppy with a slight malt note. The flavor is bitter, piney and hoppy with a slightly sweet malt note and a slight grapefruit note. Medium bodied, relatively smooth and dry.
Pizza Port Palisade Pale Ale;Carlsbad, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Pours a golden yellow in hue with a small white head. Aromas of light yeast and a little citrus. The flavors though were a little off for me. I haven’t experienced this palisades hop before, but with this brew, the flavors don’t seem to come together well. It has a light bitterness, with the hops at the forefront, yet the flavors of those hops don’t do well on my palate. I will have to try it again, as I do with port brews.
Pizza Port Palisade Pale Ale;Carlsbad, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);"Pours a crisp clear golden color with a medium ghost white head atop the liquid. Lacing is adequate. Aroma is nice and hoppy with a definite west coast flair. Flavor follows suit with an ""unbalanced"" hop to malt profile, but unbalanced is perfect for this beer. This is a hop monster but not over the top. The mouthfeel is medium with a clean dry to medium finish. This may be the best PP Carlsbad beer I’ve tasted yet."
Beer Works Mad Hops;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Beer Works;On tap at the Canal Street location on 6 April 2010. Clearly not a special in view of its reappearance. Red colour. Off-white head. Some hops but not really mad. Some sort of Imperial Red/DIPA (ABV wasn’t stared on the board)? Clean mouthfeel. Modest bitterness. Nicely drinkable. Could’ve been madder.
Beer Works Mad Hops;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Beer Works;On tap from Canal Street Beer Works. Pours a dark copper color with a small thin head.

Aroma of sweet cascade-type hops, grapefruit and loads of sweet malt. Caramel, toast and a bit of dried fruit as well. Grape/raisins along with some sweet breadiness as well. Flavour is more American Strong than IIPA. Sweet bready malt flavour, some toastiness, fruity malt and fruity cherry esters. A fairly hoppy flavour that shows off grapefruit, pine, and some earthy/woody resin as well. Fairly assertive bitterness on the back, but it lacks the big hoppy aroma/flavour that makes a great IIPA.
Beer Works Mad Hops;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Beer Works;Draft. Caramel brown with 1 finger cappucino-link foam.

Berkshire Whoa Heavy Scotch Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Berkshire Brewing Company;Hand-Pumped Cask @ Bukowski’s Tavern, Boston, MA: Very delicate aroma, deep red/brown in colour, no head to speak of. The taste was heavy in alcohol, some good caramel sweetness, and a heavy maltiness that - by the time I was done - I was finding somewhat cloying. Still, an exciting one for me.
Berkshire Whoa Heavy Scotch Ale;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Berkshire Brewing Company;On cask. Pours copper with a thin filmy head. Smells of peat, roses, some caramel and toffee. Tastes malty with some nice butterscotch like elements.

Montana Brewing Custers Last Stout;Billings, Montana, United States;Stout;Montana Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery. Having just visited the site of the Little Bighorn, knowing its history and now having stood in a place of such devastation, I don’t find any humor in the beer’s name. That said, this is a solid if ordinary stout ... it’s black of course, delivering a bit of coffee and chocolate. (#6365, 10/10/2016)
Montana Brewing Custers Last Stout;Billings, Montana, United States;Stout;Montana Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Dark brown pour with a kaki head. Roasted malt aromas. Smooth and creamy with loads of dark roasted malts. Hints of baker’s chocolate. Good body and mouthfeel. Not overly complex but clean and refreshing.
Montana Brewing Custers Last Stout;Billings, Montana, United States;Stout;Montana Brewing Company;This was poured into a 10 oz pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking dark brown close to black color with a bar pour’s kind of slim white to off white foamy head that dissipated evenly to allow a decent lacing roaming about. The smell had a thick rich roasted cocoa bean to slight coffee rich indulgent glossed over cakey-ness. The taste was pretty much exactly the same and covered a big cakey rich chocolate into the aftertaste. Semi-dry finish came across nicely. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a rich chocolatey roastiness rolling over my tongue, indulgent - definitely. Semi-sipper to somewhat of a drinker allowed me to be quite pleased. Overall, foreign/export stout or American stout, maybe a cross between the two. If anything, I liked it and would have it again.

Montana Brewing Whitetail Wheat;Billings, Montana, United States;Wheat Ale;Montana Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. This was poured into a 10 oz pint glass. The appearance was a hazy golden orange color with a slim bar pour’s kind of head that dissipated slightly allowing a nice looking clingy lacing running here and there. The smell had a decent light sweet wheat, balanced and adequate. The taste was mainly sweet with a light kick of wheat at the end to balance. Semi - citrus aftertaste lead to a sweet dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed appropriately styled as it was subdued enough to allow the wheat to be the substance running over my palate. Overall, I say this was a pretty good American Pale Wheat Ale that I would have again.

Smells mild hopped. Some ripe fruits and a little bit of crackers. Decent, nothing more. Easy to drink. Its mild oily in the mouth and below average on the carbonation. Not a horrible tasting lager this actually. More vienna like IMO. Biscuity in a way, a little sweetness. Kinda floral in the taste. Its nothing Im gonna remember for too long for the flavor, but Ill definitely remember it due to the time I went to Barcade in NYC. 19.06.2015

Cape Ann Fisherman's Brew;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cape Ann Brewing Company;At Cheers, Beacon Hill, Boston, MA. Classified as amber lager, though quite bitter. Taste (and smell) actually reminding of the sea.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Brew;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Light amber pour, quite clear, with lots of nearly white head. Very grainy nose, almost to the point where it smells like fresh wort. There’s a little hint of caramel underneath but this is really quite one dimensional to me. The palate is about the same, but slightly better. There’s a little spicy hint that gives it at least a touch of character. This is definitely a pass.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Brew;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Pours a clear coppery amber with off-white head. Bready malty aromas. Citrus and honey notes. A pretty average lager, nothing special at all.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Brew;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Spicey and nutty earthy aroma with some metallic background. Clear orange color, collapsing head. Bittersweet caramel taste, very much an English brew in this way, although it’s a lager. Crisp clean body, for medium length sessions. Okay stuff, not a match for the heavy hitters in this category.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Brew;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Pours a coppery amber with a medium off white head. Aroma of light caramel malt some grains and light fruity notes. Taste same as aroma with mild bitter notes. Palate is a medium body with mild carbonation.

Montana Brewing Fat Belly Amber;Billings, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Montana Brewing Company;Tap @ MBC. Was recommended this over their wheat. Not impressed. Pours very dark brown, not the least bit amber. Caramel, maybe some toffee and maybe a hint of hops. Taste is just very bland, and body too light. Compared to a good scottish ale, the body is too light, compared to an american amber, there’s not enough hops. All in all, a watery and underwhelming experience.
Montana Brewing Fat Belly Amber;Billings, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Montana Brewing Company;Draft at MBC: Pours more of a dark chestnut color than amber, but topped with a creamy beige head. Nice aroma is nutty, earthy, floral, and caramel. Tastes more malty, but not overly sweet. The earthiness and florals go well with a light nuttiness and more caramel. Nice.

Taste is semi-sweet, medium bodied, light carbonation with some sweet malt and flowery hop flavors. Finish has a nice malt and hop bitter aftertaste that also has a semi-sweet and then clean flavor. Reading some of the previous rates it looks like either I received a fresh batch or the brewmaster’s experience has really improved since the last rating.
Montana Brewing Fat Belly Amber;Billings, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Montana Brewing Company;Light amaber color with small head. Light roasted malt with hop nose. Flavor much the same with a very water middle and finish.
Montana Brewing Fat Belly Amber;Billings, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Montana Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub.

Paper City Summer Haze;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Paper City Brewery;On tap pours a slightly cloudy straw color with a white head. The taste is more of an american wheat then a wit. The overall flavor was wheat with some citrus and a little spice.
Paper City Summer Haze;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Paper City Brewery;Pours a golden orange hue, quickly dissipating soda like head. Sweet spicy nose, floral, fruity, sweet. Palate is the same. Quite fizzy, spiced, fruit, awefully limey, watery texture, funky yeast, overly sweet. Perhaps a more fresh sample would be better, but I think not.
Paper City Summer Haze;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Paper City Brewery;2005 bottle. Color is a brass to deep urine, with a deeply faded, lime-green tint. Good amount of sediment at the bottom. Large off-white head is well-retained. Massive amounts of small bubbles make their way to the surface, providing an aroma of soft grassiness, lemon and coriander. A light creamy sweet malt in the background as well. Flavor begins with a big herbal note of coriander, with some lemon and light white pepper perhaps. Some soft, fluffy yeast and a light, moist honey-whitebread maltiness. Light, pleasing acidity, very zesty bubbles for texture. Some citrus tones linger on the tongue nicely. Honey and some faint caramel. The spices (probably the pepper?) create a slight numbing effect on the tongue. Not watery at all with a strong linger flavor that coats the palate well. Spritzy at times. The bottle makes no indication that this is a Belgian Wit. Not to say that it is not, (and if it is, it’s not to style at all). But I don’t get the feeling that it was made to any particular style. Probably just a hybrid, refreshing, spiced summer ale.
Paper City Summer Haze;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Paper City Brewery;Draught @ CTRiver Brewers Festival: This was an all-around unappealing beer. It was a golden color, with some white head. The aroma was sweet- pretty much sickly sweet. Fruit was in there. Maybe lime. There was also some wheat down in there. The taste was not very good at all. Sickly sweet again. This wasn’t even close to a Wit.
Paper City Summer Haze;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Paper City Brewery;For once I wish a beer was cooler as it would probably be more fitting for the style. As it was, it just came from a cooler with no ice after a brief trip. In the same vein as Celis white and Hogaarden predecessors, but lacking the subtlety in most all regards - spicing and sweetness especially. I did enjoy it, but if you’re looking for nuance it’s a bit of a leap.
Paper City Summer Haze;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Paper City Brewery;12oz Bottle No Date A slightly cloudy honey color with a head that never really happens. Huge coriander nose is one dimensional yet attractive. Body is thin and lacking carbonation. Watery flavor with some orange notes. Overall a dissapointment. They can do better this I know.
Paper City Summer Haze;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Paper City Brewery;Light golden and hazy in color with a small white head. Aroma is of ginger,corriander and orange with a subtle wheat tang character. Flavors of fruit and spice donimate with some wheat malt in the background.
Paper City Summer Haze;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Paper City Brewery;Strange sweet fruits, indeed, Volgon, and Muzzle is dad on with the lime. Whew, this is a weird one. I wanted it to be heftier. Very carbonated. Only a good dose of pepper kees this evn remotely traditional. Still, it is quenching.
Paper City Summer Haze;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Paper City Brewery;"Sample at the Vermont Brewers Fest. Big lime nose...not lemon, not banana or orange, but lime; just a hint of lemon and apple. Rather odd. Light yeastiness in the body, creamy, sweet and soda-like. Interesting for sure, but just ok as something to drink."

Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #05 - Alt Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Harpoon Brewery;Nice color and, typical of the style, easy to drink. At times too similar to other Harpoon products A bit flatter than I like.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #05 - Alt Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Harpoon Brewery;I finally tracked one of these down. Worthwhile, though a bit weak even for the style. Amber/reddish with a white head. Smells roasty with some rosey elements. Taste is sweet and fruity with a decent finish.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #05 - Alt Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Harpoon Brewery;Deep amber and clear with a god off white head.

Moderate to low for the hop aspect.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #05 - Alt Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Harpoon Brewery;Clear, bright amber color, slim, tight, white rings caps it off. Aroma: sweetness, from fruit and caramel tones, apples and berries, grapes, a hint of oak and vanilla, just a tease of spices. Nice. This ale meets the tongue amiably, gently passing the lips and providing a pleasant hoppy breeze. It’s a brief blitz, gritty, then dimmed. The palate is lightly touched with flavor, then it fades clean off, leaving only a faint echo. While it lingers, though, it’s a fine fruity flavor, with nutty, cola-ish edges. Medium bodied, and a supreme drinker, as quaffable as they come. An okay alt, sure, but nothing to shout about.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #05 - Alt Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Harpoon Brewery;Pours amber/copper. Aromas of sweet malt, brown sugar, and hops. Body is too thin, and the flavor is bland. Not as sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe, with flavors of brown sugar and hops.

Hazy brownish-red, light magenta tinges and some darker browns. Small light tan/cream head. Aroma of soft, even chocolate malt, some fluffy yeast, hints of alcohol and a soft, sweet fruit smell (grapes, cherries, blueberries). Much less aggressive and astringent than the Bizzaro, but also, a bit more thin and less adventurous. Had a muted blueberry/grapes flavor that lingered on the background. Almost no carbonation, lightly alcoholic and sugary on the finish. I think it went too flat, but it had a pretty smooth flavor for a dark strong.

Wyre Piddle Piddle in the Snow;Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wyre Piddle;Cask (Kitty’s, Helsinki) Cloudy dark gold, small head - end of barrel perhaps? Not much aroma, hints of sourness and nuttiness. A bit veggie taste. Decent nutty hoppiness with a decent finish, but way too much of a sour component.
Wyre Piddle Piddle in the Snow;Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wyre Piddle;On cask @ The ’Freshie’ Formby. Mid to light brown coloured ale with a creamy head and lovely mix of hops and malt. A very easy drinking ale whose taste disguises its strength.

Wyre Piddle Piddle in the Snow;Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wyre Piddle;Cask Conditioned at a Wetherspoons. Deep brown with whispy head. Dark roasted malt dominates the flavours in this somewhat unbalanced beer. A strange boiled hop note takes you in another direction, there is also a saccharin sweetness. Strange an challenging pint.

Anderson Valley Brother David's Triple Abbey-Style Ale;Boonville, California, United States;Tripel;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Gifted for my birthday from Doug Theresa Aadland, Brother David’s Triple is an Abbey style ale brewed by Anderson Valley Brewing Company. The aroma of toffee, raisins, apricot, and spices are noted as you drink. The appearance is a bronze amber with a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 10%. Raisins and apricots sweeten the body. The apricot imbues amazingly with how watery the beer comes across. Toffee thickens the comprehension and gives off a cream life tone with the Trappist yeast used. Honey is noticed when you lick your chops and assists the sweet tone. Pear is easily distinguished as the finish dries. Coriander compliments the apricot aspect. Clove spices the take and glows with the finish. Demerara sugar has a different sugary feel than I’m used to. Brother David’s Triple is a beautiful Trappist ale. The water, apricots, and coriander against a toffee body set this beer apart from the Belgian crowd. The honey, toffee, and malted barely takes this ale to another level. After spending spending a couple months in Belgium and drinking Trappist beer at this source, Brother David’s Triple hits the mark for a Trappist ale. The water quality makes this strong beer easy to drink and refreshing. Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer. For more beer reviews, visit and like my blog “Drink For the Love of Beer.”

Hampshire Thunderbolt;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hampshire Brewery;Bottle. Pours a light brown colour with a real thin white head. The aroma is all hops,the taste is very hoppy with a real taste of citrus and a nice bitter finish.
Hampshire Thunderbolt;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hampshire Brewery;Cask with Mes at the Market Porter, 2nd Sept 2007. Light amber appearance. Aroma of coffee and marzipan but with an unwelcome artificial sweetness. Tastes of hops and roasted coffee. The long lasting bitter finish does a bit to redeem it but overall I found it to be a mish-mash of flavours that doesn’t really work.
Hampshire Thunderbolt;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hampshire Brewery;Cask at Market Porter, Southwark, London. An amber beer with a thin orange head. The aroma is sweet mlaty with primary notes of caramel - and so is the flavor. The body is thin. I find it boring.

Hampshire Thunderbolt;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hampshire Brewery;(Cask at Market Porter, Southwark, London, 5 Aug 2007) Copper colour with brief beige head, slightly cloudy. Malty, nutty nose with notes of toffee and slightly buttery aromas. Malty, nutty taste with notes of toffee, butter and a rather bland bitterness in the finish. Not much of a thunderbolt to be honest.
Hampshire Thunderbolt;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hampshire Brewery;A Mes rate: Cask at the Market Porter. Light amber with a slight white head. Tobacco, dusty grapefruit and some sweet malt in the aroma. Similar flavour, mellow malt & fruity hops with a sweet nutty finish. Totally standard.

Anton Svetlo;Grosuplje, Slovenia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarna Anton;Hazy pale straw coloured, headless and sad-looking. Sweetened grains and vague cereals are paired with creamy hay and unattended to hops that procure very little bitterness. Rather unclean with the yeast feeling a bit stale all over the place. Thin .
Anton Svetlo;Grosuplje, Slovenia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarna Anton;Sampled draught at Anton, Grosuplje, Slovenia. -Hazy yellow coloured, no head, sweet and watery with some yeast, ordinary slovenian home brewed pilsener
Anton Temno;Grosuplje, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Anton;Pretty black, opaque body covered by a thin off-white head. More roasty character than most Slovenian beers with hintings at dark chocolate and anise. Little hoppiness to be noticed, but the malts, albeit quite sweet, manage to let the beer remains quite drinkable thanks to their leanness, whether it is voluntary or not. Quick finish with a chocolate milk kiss. Not too bad, but terrifyingly simple.

Puntigamer Zwicklbier;Graz, Austria;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Puntigamer (Brau Union);From notes. Enjoyed on draft at the brewery in Graz with Gary on November 18. The pour is a darker orange color with a thick white head that slowly fades leaving a good lace. The aroma is full of metallic malts and sweetness. There is a light hop, and a decent alcohol. A light graininess rounds it out. The flavor is much of the same. There is a maltiness and a sweet metal that comes through pretty heavy. The mouth feel is watery and crisp without much carbonation and a lingeringly sweet pilsner malt on the back end. It’s an interesting beer.

Coopers Cave Helles;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Coopers Cave Ale Company;I dont know if you guys had a bad bottle but mine was not contaminated, probably due to chlorine.. Light gold in colour. A got a honey nose with a whiff of chlorine. Rather bland taste, a ain with that chlorinated taste. Seems that the brewer may not be doing a good rinsing job. But no cucumber or other vegetables in here.

Coopers Cave Helles;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Cucumber, dust, DMS (cabbage) and cherry jam in the aroma. Clear yellow-gold with white fully diminishing head. Stale, earthy, moldy flavour. Light, still body. Sampled with MartinT and Rastacouere. Bottle.
Coopers Cave Helles;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Totally clear straw yellow with a white film as a head. Aroma is weird to say the least. Your mother’s cucumber’s dip in which she unloaded the dust from the vacuum cleaner’s filter. Dry yet boiled vegetables, already astringent from smelling. Palate is watery, unpleasant, not as despicable as the nose, but fully flawed, anywhere and everywhere possible and thinkable. Surprising notes of pumpkin, bland eggs, chalky finish, fully oxidized and I’m fairly sure the bottle was rather fresh. Thin body and low carbonation just can’t help the off-flavors. A never-ending, unfinishable nightmare where all your worse memories are thrown back at you.
Brouwers aan den Rijn Rijngoud;Alphen aan den Rijn, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwers aan den Rijn;Bottled. Cloudy orange color, short head. Aroma of broth/bouillon, meat, some sweet caramel, slight spicy. Weird stuff, can’t stop thinking of the broth, which makes it quite hard to drink. Furthermore, it is not that bad, just a bit unbalanced, and not too complex. Maybe heating it up, and adding some vegetables would make it a good soup.
Brouwers aan den Rijn Rijngoud;Alphen aan den Rijn, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwers aan den Rijn;Bottled. Aroma has malts, bouillon of cowflesh, yeast and fruits.

Brouwers aan den Rijn Rijngoud;Alphen aan den Rijn, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwers aan den Rijn;Bottled. A very hazy blonde coloured beer with a nice pillowy white head. Looks a little like a hefeweizen in the glass. Aroma is a little soapy and peppery and lemony. Some yeast notes also . The tste is light and unassuming, but very pleasant to drink. Light fruitiness and some yeast charcter. A touch of peppery hop. Very pleasant.
Brouwers aan den Rijn Rijngoud;Alphen aan den Rijn, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwers aan den Rijn;From St Servattumus: Blonde and cloudy. What an indifferent aroma and flavor!

Gwada Rhum (-2009);Baie-Mahault, Guadeloupe;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gwada (Les Brasseurs de Guadeloupe);"When I came across this, I was not sure what to expect. It is certainly unusual, but not unpleasant. The colour is pale amber and there are hints of malt in the flavour. At a guess, I would say it is based on the same brewer’s Ambree, but I couldn’t be sure. The rum is noticeable, but not overpowering. I can’t say I’d drink a lot of this, but an interesting novelty nonetheless. My biggest problem with this is what style to put this under as none of the options seemed to fit. In the end, I plumped for the catch-all ""Ale"". Bottled, Guadeloupe airport."
Lake Placid Matts Maibock;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a slight golden yellow to copper color with a film of a white foamy head that fell off at a decent pace. Sly lace. The aroma had some malty sweet caramel/toffee tones rolling over some nuts. Light grassy hops underneath. The flavor makes a decent effort to blend the malts to the hops but mainly keeps the malts up front sticking to my taste buds fairly nice and clean. Moderate bitter sort of finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Slight sort of stickiness along my tongue, but acceptable. ABV felt as projected despite being just a tad higher than normal for the style, I didn’t mind. Overall, really good as a beer, just to have as a beer. I didn’t mind the higher alcohol content for Lake Placid’s version of this style.
Lake Placid Matts Maibock;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;Not oversweet, not over bitter. A perfect balance of taste. Caramel and nutty taste very present. This made my week-end! Too bad we can’t by in bottles but only in growler to go...

Lake Placid Matts Maibock;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;04.29.06 TAPNY Pale golden below sticky white head. Aroma is mildly hopped with herbs, grasses, pungent straw. It’s got a lighter feel for a big maibock, crisp and lithe, not too sweet but nice balance of softly toasted malts and mild grassy/earthy hops.
Lake Placid Matts Maibock;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;TAP NY. Pours a light blonde with a lasting sticky white head. Aroma of light sweet careml and sticky bready malts, light herbal hops. Flavor is mostly sweet, bready lightly herbal, sharp pils malt and light bitterness in the end for balance. Great smooth mouthfeel and well made. Clean finish.
Lake Placid Matts Maibock;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;Growler--fruity aroma, I smell white grapes and pears in the nose. Pours a tranparent copper with a miniscule white head. Start is sweet, then leading to some sourness and then some hops in the middle balanced nicely with malts. Bitter finish that makes me come crawling back for more. I’m a relatively newbie to maibocks, but this beer just keeps making me come back for more, so it’s got to have something working for it.
Lake Placid Matts Maibock;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;Growler...clear golden pour with a thin white head that does not last. Malty aroma with some dried fruit aroma (maybe raisins?). Very malty and sweet, alcohol isn’t really detectable. Quite syrupy. Not the kind of beer you can drink too many of. I believe this is my 1st Maibock, therefore I am not really sure of the typical characteristics...

This was a bonus beer for me as having drunk my Dunkel much quicker than Loz or my mum I was handed both of theirs tofinish. Light golden in colour, having a standard Pilsnery type bitterness, I agreed with Loz it just tasted a touch too fizzy for my liking and lacked character.

Hainfelder Spezialbier Hell;Hainfeld, Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Hainfeld;Kein klassisches Spezial-Bier, da es dafür etwas zu stark ist. Es geht schon in Richtung heller Bock.

Hainfelder Spezialbier Hell;Hainfeld, Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Hainfeld;"500 mL Flasche from a small market on Josefstädter Straße in Wien. I will have to go back and note the name for this the review; they tend to have a small but interesting selection of German and Austrian beers. Very pale with a rapidly dissipating head and no residue on the glass. Surprisingly little carbonation. Nothing stands out here, but for a stronger euro lager it is smooth and drinkable nonetheless. Nice choice to combat the recent heat wave in Vienna."
Kirin Latte Stout;Tokyo, Japan;Stout;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);"Now I joked about saying ""Oh joy"" when I saw Keystone in my local convenience store, but I really was happy to find this little gem tonight, only 200 yards away too! An opaque dark chocolate brown with a foamy light brown head. True to it’s name, coffee is prominent in the nose with some malty sweetness and roasted malts, but not nearly as powerful of a roasted aroma as the Asahi stout I had last night. A very mild roasty flavor with a malty sweetness, a Mocha Latte and Guinness combined. Not a stunning stout but very tasty and easy to drink. This could easily become my ""go to"" beer! Look for this one!"

Penns Best NA;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Can: Bubbly, clear, beige-yellow, with a foamy white head. Minimal aroma.....grain, water. Taste is slightly stronger, but just as plain. Barley, water...... Displays less of the cornflake-water note that many NA’s have...... Fairly drinkable in a pinch.
Penns Best NA;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;I think all republicans should have to drink this because, according to the can, it was made since 1863 which was when we had our first republican president, Abraham Lincoln. He created the first federal income tax and got shot in the head and these two facts are more than just tangentially related. In any case, this is a damn solid NA beer. Its watery and a bit metallic but I will be damned if it doesn’t have a tiny touch of actual malt character and some lemony hops going on. I’d believe this was like three percent alcohol if you told me. Not fucken bad! Also, the current republican president can eat shit.
Penns Best NA;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Can. Light barley wort and cardboard aroma. Golden yellow with moderate white head. Very lightly sweet barley malt with hint of straw flavor. No body. This is the beer for you if you want mineral water with a hint of beer.

Penns Best NA. All 3 raters rated the beers 213. 355ml can, appears to be brewed at genesee. Clear golden pour. aroma is floral and cascade hops. Wooo a NA with at least a smidge of hops. But it really is not much. Flavor is a lightly hopped metallic flowery N/A. Post tasting thoughts: It is like 2$ a 6 pack and is not the worst N/A.. take it or leave it...
Penns Best NA;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Can. Pours clear, wan yellow with a frothy porcelain head. And it’s downhill from there. Aroma is - hello? Earth to aroma! I can’t get a blamed thing. Flavor is barely malty - this tastes like heavily watered-down macro-brewed swill. I could get tipsy faster drinking Mountain Dew. Mouthfeel is indistinguishable from water. Well, the can was only 50 cents, and I had to give it a fair shake.

Garrison Tall Ship Amber;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Garrison Brewing Company;A 20 oz draft pour at the Wheelhouse, Digby. This seems to be marketed as a pale ale these days and at a ABV of 5.0. It seemed to be served to cold as it has what looked like ice bubbles floating that diminishes slowly. Still it was a decent fruity ale.
Garrison Tall Ship Amber;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Garrison Brewing Company;Can from NSLC A: cereal no much more. App: clear copper sparing white head.

Garrison Tall Ship Amber;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Garrison Brewing Company;Gift from my sister-in-law, drank that one while watching the movie The Darkest Hour, great movie, great beer.

Garrison Tall Ship Amber;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Garrison Brewing Company;My go-to brew! Light enough to be an easy drinking beer, yet flavorful enough to be interesting. Slight metallic honey/caramel with medium carbonation. Perfect evening beer.
Garrison Tall Ship Amber;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Garrison Brewing Company;Perfect pour and foamy head that lasts, good clear red body. Vague cracker aroma but really needs more of anything on the nose. Flavour is a lot of crisp cracker and medium on the mouth. Serviceable but again little to write home about here.

Kirin Blue Label;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Bugger, the first to rate this without any real reference to what this should be apart from a pale lager. Well that’s what it looks like in the glass. Not bad actually but I have a feeling that there is not much promise. The nose is corn and some other sort of unknown grain and so is the flavour, a slight roughness on the palate. That’s all. Next.

The aroma was bitter and tangy with fruity hops, cactus, pine and pepper. The flavor was bitter, tart and dryish with cactus, pine and lemon then a sweet caramel undertone. Long hoppy finish. Moderately full bodied and smooth. Decent
The Brew Kettle Old 21;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Brew Kettle;Bottle thanks to JSquire, drunk 8/29/16. Good clarity in this tangerine-golden body with a medium-sized, fairly well-retained, white head. Big fruity, citric, punchy and aggressive nose has plentiful cherry, strawberry, ruby red grapefruit and very light pineapple. Sweet caramel malts balance, somewhat, but there’s certainly some resin and booze present here. As with their other IPAs, it’s flavorful as hell, with big bursts of fruitiness, strong citrus and tangy pine and soft, balancing honey-caramel-like malts. Engaging carbonation and lingering pine, grapefruit and light sour-like resin. I like a lot of these flavors, but there’s just too much resin/acidity here and it fatigues the palate rather quickly.
The Brew Kettle Old 21;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Brew Kettle;"Bottle. Nose heavy pine and grapefruit rind, buffed caramel; pour orange-amber with a sudsy cream head. Taste very sweet and very bitter, some resin, huge pine, huge caramel/toffee, nice underlying earth/wood, strong-but-not-burning alcohol. Full body, creamy rather than crisp, bold flavor with strong lemon and tangerine citrus, quite heavily perfumed floral finish and aftertaste (which I will most remember about this one). Clean with sticky lips. Not getting terribly much of the advertised Simcoe, but I enjoy the occasional a trip down memory lane with view to sugar-and-hops booze bombs of old. [2016.08.27: 3.3]"

The Brew Kettle Old 21;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Brew Kettle;Tap at local roots. Nose is all hop with a bit of sweetness in there. Hop bite is muted by sugar up front. Little floral notes until the end. A bit too sugary for me but smooth as butter.

Aroma is a nice resiny piney citrus hit with a sweet caramel malt backbone. Taste is nice and hoppy with a lot of grapefruit and a little pine, sweet caramel.

Ringneck FOTB Barleywine;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Kettle;On tap at the Brew Kettle. 07 vintage keg. Pour is cloudy amber color with off white head. This has an amazing aroma showcasing raisin, caramel, and a sweet tangy bite. Has a medium heavy mouthfeel. Flavor follows the nose and has smooth character that is inviting. Overall a top notch brew. Should be on tap all the time at this place and I’d never leave.
Ringneck FOTB Barleywine;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Kettle;2004 Vintage. Poured a hazy golden amber color with a small off-white head. The aroma was of oxidized malt with some cheezy notes. Sweet malty flavor with notes of caramel and a hoppy finish. Warming with a medium-full body.
Ringneck FOTB Barleywine;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Kettle;Bottle at my latest BW tasting. Pours a deep peachy amber, hazy with an ok head. Aroma is light in alcohol right off the start, good nutty doughy and toasted swet malts, honey, raisin and slightly estery with a nice floral hop component. Flavor seems a bit sweet, caramel and honey in there, molasses and toasted malts with a floral honey finish and a bit dirty yeast as well- not quite refined but still ok.
Ringneck FOTB Barleywine;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Kettle;Bottled. Aroma is ok, toasty sweet, mildly oxidized. Taste is incredibly astringent, still hoppy but only in bitterness. Tough to drink. Not great.
Ringneck FOTB Barleywine;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Kettle;On tap at Rich O’s Publick House when I stopped on the way to Dark Lord Day. Left over from Gravity Head. Slightly hazy, deep amber in color, with a frim off-white head. Light malt aroma that lacks complexity for a Barleywine. Sweet malt flavor (but not overly so)with some bitterness in the finish. A bit one-dimensional, this would be a good candidate to age a bit more.
Ringneck FOTB Barleywine;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Kettle;Draft @ Gravity Head: Pours lightly cloudy amber with a spare white head. Burnt caramel stands out in the sweet aroma. Lots of hop character in the body - flower, pine, grapefruit and orange. The malts bring sweet fruit to mind as well - peach, pineapple and apple work well with lots of caramel and bubblegum. A well done BW.
Ringneck FOTB Barleywine;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Kettle;Draft. Clear ruby body, little head. Lots of aromas: toffee, doough, cherries, sweat, flowers, sweet malts. The flavor, though, is only moderately sweet compared to the heavy bitterness. Full bodied and low carbonation. Astringent, bitter finish.
Ringneck FOTB Barleywine;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Kettle;Tap at the Brewpub. Aroma: Nice malt up front with some light toast, caramel, toffee, and bread. Fairly assertive hoppiness comes through next with citrus, pine, and a touch of floral. Alcohol is there, but not hot or unpleasant. Appearance: Deep reddish brown in color and clear. Medium beige head was small and creamy with good retention. Nice lacing. Flavor: Lots of malt sweetness upfront with notes of caramel, bread, toasted nuts, nutmeg, and a very light chocolate. Again, the hops come in strong with pine, citrus, floral, and a touch of grass. Alcohol is pleasant and warming throughout. Medium-high bitterness. Lingering sweetness post finish. Palate: Full bodied. Moderate carbonation. Alcohol warming in back and roof of mouth. Overall: Solid barelywine. I missed the 3 year old one they had on tap earlier in the day. Would have liked to try them side by side.
Ringneck FOTB Barleywine;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Kettle;Had on tap at the Brew Kettle as part of sampler. 2007 batch. Reddish brown in color, slight head. Smelled sweet and caramel like. Tasted very smooth! Very sweet up front. Brown sugar or molases, then some piney, fruity flavors, finishing with a bitter hoppy taste. Which is blended well here. Both my husband and I enjoyed this very much!
Ringneck FOTB Barleywine;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Kettle;2004 bomber, courtesy of Ron Bush- Vintage Estate Wine & Beer. Green waxed top. Pours an amber brown, burgundy color with a small white head. Aroma is extremely hoppy with citrus and alcohol overtones. Smells as if this was brewed in a wet pine forrest in Oregon. Taste is bitter hoppy with lots of piney and woody flavors. Excellent and not as sweet as some barleywines tend to be. Thanks Ron !!!
Whittingtons Nine Lives;Newent, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Whittingtons;"50cl bottle picked up at the Three Choirs Vineyard near Newent. A bright amber pour with a thin white head; sour fruity aroma; sour apple taste with a hint of farmyard; and a light sour finish. Actually better than it sounds."
Whittingtons Nine Lives;Newent, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Whittingtons;Bottle at home, from the Wine Society Winter Beer Box, big thanks to Jeff 26/12/16. Gusher Alert !!! ... fearing the worst now. Golden copper with a decent off white cap. Nose is orange peel, light plastic, biscuit, brown bread, faint spice., lemon rind, damp straw. Taste comprises light funk, brett like notes, hay bale, tarte fruit rinds, farmyard, bready pangs. Medium bodied, fine carbonation with a little prickle, semi drying close with a light bitter edge and soured fruit closure. Bit of an infection here me thinks but I managed the rest of the bottle that hadn’t gushed ... almost like a light sour in some respects and it began to grown on me! Yup ... I doubt I’d have enjoyed this as much if it was delivered as intended !!
Whittingtons Nine Lives;Newent, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Whittingtons;Bottle @home. Pours gold, bland nose slight butter also some sweetness and cinnamon. Sounds like a cinnamon bun but it did not smell as nice as that. taste is thin bitter after taste, lacks something like some ompf.
Whittingtons Nine Lives;Newent, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Whittingtons;Bottle, courtesy of jmgreenuk. Pours a hazy amber beer with a thick white head on top. Aroma is faint caramel and rather bland. Flavor is quite metallic, boring and not so good. Doesn’t seem to fit the style well, not so impressive. Meh.
Whittingtons Nine Lives;Newent, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Whittingtons;Poured a hazy medium amber with a frothy white head. The aroma is weak malt. The flavour is medium bitter with a metallic hop palate. Light bodied with average carbonation. Perhaps served a little too cool but not the best example of an English bitter.

Whittingtons Nine Lives;Newent, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Whittingtons;500ml bottle bottle-conditioned. Poured amber with slight haze, minimal head. Little aroma. Taste: rather smokey/chalkey. Malt dominates. Not bitter. There is sweetness, balanced by dryness. Overall: an odd beer. I don’t know what its trying to be. Its neither a malty bitter nor a hoppy one. bb12/13
Whittingtons Nine Lives;Newent, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Whittingtons;Pleasant enough but not really very memorable. Quite a dry bitter ending, with a hint of citrus in the after taste.

Harboe Compliment;Skælskør, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Harboes Bryggeri;Bottle. Amber colour, rather dull head. Aroma of malt and caramel with some hops. Flavour is rather thin with malt, bit of caramel and slightly yeastish. Bitter finish. Drinkable beer.

Harboe Compliment;Skælskør, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Harboes Bryggeri;Bottle. Henrik Søgaard found this at a beer collector. Should have been tasted before October 30th. No head. Light amber color and a bit hazy. Aroma is hops and caramel. Taste is dull and flat. No carbonation left.
Harboe Compliment;Skælskør, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Harboes Bryggeri;(Bottle 50 cl) Deep, clear amber colour - almost no head. A bit flat as most often in Harboes plastic PET-bottles. Rather sticky, caramelish malt character pretty much without bitterness. Notes of chicken fodder, but I’m not sure if there’s actually corn in this. An unusual style for Harboe - this is closer to a Vienna. 250205
Harboe Compliment;Skælskør, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Harboes Bryggeri;An amber beer with an OK but disappearing dense off-white head. The aroma is sweet and contains lots of caramel as well as candy sugar, slight burnt notes, and some grass. The flavor though doesn’t measure up to what the aroma promises. The flavor is sweet with sour hints from the notes of corn, but also with notes of metal and caramel. The mouthfeel is flat - all the carbonization turn into head when it is poured.
Harboe Compliment;Skælskør, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Harboes Bryggeri;Just another boring pilsner from Harboe. Amber colour, low head. Not much hops. Rather watery
Harboe Compliment;Skælskør, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Harboes Bryggeri;White greamy head. Golden beer. Watery beer with some malt and hops. No a beer that I´ll look for again...
Harboe Compliment;Skælskør, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Harboes Bryggeri;Plastic bottle. Amber colour gives this a two for appearance. It looked decent and all. Aroma is revolting and dusty. Flavour is chemical. Very chemical.
Harboe Compliment;Skælskør, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Harboes Bryggeri;"Bottled. Amber with a short head. An artificial, dusty aroma. Dry and too much carbonation. All and all; artificial."

Nagyon sötét barnaság fogadott, szinte sötétbarna habbal, ami sajnos hamar el is tűnt. Picit alkoholos illat, ami meglep, mivel a sör 4,1 százalékos. Emellett karamelles, kávés , csokis alapillat. Nem rossz. Íze édeskés, karamelles, és még megfelelően testes is, gyenge szénsavasság mellett. Vegyesen kávés és csokis, pörkölt malátás lecsengés. Kellemes meglepetés volt.

Patagonia Lager;Valdivia, Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecería Kunstmann;Tasting from Dec’ 2009. Pours bright, medium gold with large, clingy bubbles that release with pace. Mostly lasting sudsy white pad tops it. Mineral-like liquor and CO2 on the nose and that is it (What the...?). Very light in flavour too, feint grass and sweet malt and corn, chalky in feel and ultra-featherweight in body. Ends mildly bitter (A surprise!), grassy and crisp. Bouncy, bubbly carbonation doesn’t help it. There is nothing offensive to this. You could say it is half the beer it should be, or is that a quarter the beer....... (33cL, BBE 09/09, The Beer Store Morley)
Patagonia Lager;Valdivia, Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecería Kunstmann;My second Patagonia beer within a week, this one from a different brewery. Doesnt mean it gets any better but this one just shades the other. Looks dull in the glass, smells of cooked corn and tastes thin, grainy and bland.

Patagonia Lager;Valdivia, Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecería Kunstmann;Let’s see, green bottle+ made in Chile +shipped to Japan= Skunked! Thin watery, not horrid but boring at best.
Patagonia Lager;Valdivia, Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecería Kunstmann;Initial aroma was rather skunky, but mellowed out to a slightly hopped cooked corn cob doused in kerosene and lightly perfumed with moldy lemon rinds. Beer is clear dark yellow, with a very thin layer of whitish foam - retention is nil. Body is thin, watery and carbonation is weak. The starting sip was rather sweet and grainy. Mediun acidity breaks in and morphs into an odd salty taste for the finish. After is light acidic and musky. Perhaps this beer packaged in green was light struck on a slow boat ride from South America to Paris, where I found it languishing on a Chile-promoting endcap display. Or maybe it’s just carbonated llama urine.
Penn Maibock;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;draft at brewery. Overall excellent springs brew. Well balanced between hops and malts that are detected in the smell and taste.
Penn Maibock;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;One of the best maibocks i have had. Definantly a comparable seasonal to the oktoberfest and marzan. I liked this alot and recomend Erie brewing companies seasonal maibock if you like this one.
Penn Maibock;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;This is by far the best Maibock you will ever drink. I do not understand the other reviews I have read. I base all of my reviews on beers that I have bought a 1/2 keg of for the house. I do not think it is fair to judge any beer on a couple of glasses or bottles. How can you gage its drink ability? A complicated beer will take time to grow on you.
Penn Maibock;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Pennsylvania Brewing Company;Draught at Penn Brewery. Dull neutral fruits, light sugar, some caramel notes in the malt. A touch of hops. Golden amber clear with a slight haze, and rapidly disspating head. Medium watery body with light-medium carbonation. Starts with cherrywood and mild caramel notes, sweet toasted malts, bit of biscuit. Light vapory notes, sweet throughout. Mild hops that grows a bit more bitter toward the finish. Cherrywood and mild nutty after and touch of sweetness.

Tryst Buckled Wheel;Larbert, Central, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tryst Brewery;Bottle at Chris_o birthday bash 08. Pale gold with thin white head. Decent sherberty hop aroma. Nice attractive aroma. A little soapy but I thought pretty decent. Bit earthy, like a lot of BCAs, but nice enough.
Tryst Buckled Wheel;Larbert, Central, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tryst Brewery;A Mes rate: Bottle at the Oi Oi Saveloy tasting at Chris O’s. Semi hazy gold with a rapidly vanishing head. Lovely hoppage, all grassy and floral. One dimensional really. Faint soap, decent tangy malt in the background giving it a slight earthy feel. Decent.

Tryst Buckled Wheel;Larbert, Central, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tryst Brewery;Old gold colour. Markedly hoppy, especially on the nose, where grassiness dominates. Markedly bitter, with just a smidgen of pale, dry malt. Tart, lingering finish, perhaps a touch astringent. Quite austere, but no serous complaints from me about this one. Bright bottled from cask (gravity dispense), Cambridge Beer Festival, May 2005. RE-RATE. Bottle (bottle conditioned) at London tasting, May 2001 (courtesy harrisoni). BBE December 2008. Murky gold/amber colour with some lumpy stuff in suspension (although my helping was from near the bottom of the bottle). Fruity hop aroma with some tropical fruit, maybe melon. Smooth and easy drinking with more fruity hops in evidence on the palate. Seemed rather more easy going and less austere than my earlier notes suggest. I wonder whether the recipe has been tweaked a little - the ABV has gone up from 4.0% to 4.2%. 7/2/6/3/13=3.1 (original score retained).
Kuhnhenn Palisade Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kuhnhenn Brewing;May 04 batch. Pours a bright godlen with some moderately darker copper tinges. Good white head. Aroma of bitter hops, not earthy or piney, but lightly floral and oily, just bitter and dry. Has some light malt in there as well. I thought the flavor was a lot less bitter than the hops predicted. Very dry and hoppy, with little malting. As it warms caramel malt emerges from within to slightly balance. Though it’s a big, hoppy APA, I thought the palisades were pretty tasty. New hop varietal from the Yakima valley. It’s cool that these guys keep on top of the latest hops strains.
Kuhnhenn Palisade Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kuhnhenn Brewing;On tap at Kuhnhenn Brewing. Appearance was a small sized white head with fine-small sized bubbles that quickly diminished. Uncarbonated, somewhat cloudy and a yellow hue. The aroma was lightly malty and lightly hoppy. The flavor was lightly bitter and moderately hoppy. This was a medium bodied APA with good lacing.
Kuhnhenn Palisade Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kuhnhenn Brewing;This draft brew from the brewery poured a small head of mostly diminishing white colored finely sized bubbles.

It had a medium strength hop flavor and a mild malty not to it.
Kuhnhenn Braggot Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Bottle (bottled in Oct 2014). Pours thick and brown with only a minimal head. Aromas of alcohol, rich malts, caramel malt, raisins. Taste is medium sweet, warming. Full bodied and thick with extremely soft carbonation. Drying, astringent finish. I am enjoying this one a lot more than I anticipated. It’s a sipper. Good.
Kuhnhenn Braggot Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Kuhnhenn Brewing;12 oz. bottle shared by Joe - thanks again, Joe! 2014 vintage, 12.8% ABV. Pours a mostly clear darkened gold color with some carbonation bubbles settling around the edge. I’m surprised at the amount of banana I’m getting from this, like a sweet bananas foster sort of thing, with honey and layers of toasted sugar, earth, wildflowers, subtle spices, and old wood. A little bit of a boozy warmth, but mostly sweet. Medium-plus bodied, with moderate carbonation. Seems older than it is. Not as good as other Kuhnhenn meads but worth checking out for sure.
Kuhnhenn Braggot Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Pour out of bottle, thanks Brandon! Dark reddish pour with slightly off white head, aroma brought notes of honey, caramel, toffee, slight orange peel, hints of vanilla.

Kuhnhenn Braggot Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"Poured a dirty brown color with amber highlights with aromas of honey, sweetness; light clove, dirt and some earth. Flavors amber romance honey with some earth, sweet aftertaste nice abv flavor as well. Decent braggot not the worst out there but very drinkable."
Kuhnhenn Braggot Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap @ Kuhnhenn: 2013 vintage. Pours a dingy shade of brown with hints of ruby. Decent clarity overall, given the deep hue of the brew. Small, bubbly, gray & beige tinted foam barely blankets the top. Aroma has lots of stuff going on. Fruity esters, spicy Belgian yeast, Bubble-Yum, earthy staunch, white pepper, mild clove, a touch of musky, damp woodiness, faint citrus... Orange zest maybe? First sip has some alcohol heat to it. But still quite tame considering the 16% ABV listing. Notes of light citrus spritz, alcohol, honey, heavy esters, clove, rotten banana, toasted bread, thick mouth coating of yeast. More subtle hints of mint, plums, musty hops, herbal tea leaves, plums, & sherry coated black cherries arise as the braggot warms up. Dense, fairly heavy mouth feel with medium carbonation. It’s a boozy & malty slow sipper, but a pretty good one at that.
Kuhnhenn Braggot Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Kuhnhenn Brewing;330ml bottle (shared by FatPhil, thanks). Slightly hazy deep brown color. No head. Sweet, malty, raisins, caramel in aroma. Malty, raisins, honey, sweet, roast, prunes, woody in taste. Liquid honey silkyness in aftertaste.
Kuhnhenn Braggot Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Kuhnhenn Brewing;355ml bottle (ALEhouse, Riga) Cap didn’t look properly closed. Opened with barely a pfft, then again, if this is a mead there won’t be any carbonation. Aroma is a pleasant sweet honey, but also has an over-aged papery barley wine aspect to it too. Deep reddy orange, flat and glassy. In the mouth it’s flat and very sweet. There’s some oxidised toffee-like malts, papery. Tons of sugar and honey. A bit messy. Not sure what a braggot should taste like, if this is a good example, then it’s an interesting style, but I prefer both barley wines and miod. Was it spoilt by an imperfect seal on the cap? Either way, it’s massively improved by a little splash of Old Monk rum - much more piratey!
Kuhnhenn Braggot Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Kuhnhenn Brewing;2011th crafted bottle, Pours more reddish that coppery with no top and no lasing. Aroma - first impression was like raspberry, caramel-candy malty quadrupel, no honey to me actually but maybe it’s just in my region there is no such wild or a special type of honey. It wasn’t sugary at all to me. Flavour of course is sweet as ... very sweet, pungent on nose and astringent to tongue, alcohol is well hidden to me, very smooth, velvety palette, thick texture and average to full bodied, no to light dry finish. Very sweet fruit overall, indeed I feel that scotch ale as backbone. Quite sipping sample except you must share it with someone cause at the end of the 330ml bottle it becomes too annoying sweet.
Grand Rapids Spring Bock;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;This poured a murky brownish orange with a nice offwhite head. Mild malty aroma. Medium bodied with taste of caramel malts, sweet but not annoyingly so, with some fruitiness. This was GRBC attempt at a maibock, while certainly not a top flight one, this was much better than the normal medoicre to bad offerings, and certainly one of the best I’ve had from there. a decent brew.

Cricket Hill Hopnotic IPA;Fairfield, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Cricket Hill Brewing Co.;Poured from the bottle. Amber with a short lived head. Less nose than I expected.

Nice lacing and retention. Aroma caramel and light pine. Taste is more sweet than bitter. Light bodied, moderate carbonation, sticky mouth feel. Finishes bittersweet.

Cricket Hill Hopnotic IPA;Fairfield, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Cricket Hill Brewing Co.;"Pours clear amber with a thick, fluffy, and rather persistent pale buff head. Crisp aroma is very hoppy and resiny; subtle malty and citrus notes provide support. Flavor is quite hoppy yet not at all bitter; malty and grapefruit notes peek through. Texture is fairly smooth and fizzy, average but pleasant. Maybe not exactly ""hopnotic,"" but enjoyable."

Clear and filtered, with a honey colored amber body under a white, thin head. Fruity, rich, oily hops up front, then some sour and astringent flavors over the middle, complete with buttery diacetyl and some soggy grains lingering into the unpleasent finish.

Grand Teton Workhorse Wheat;Victor, Idaho, United States;Wheat Ale;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;"Short lasting head and minimal lacing atop a hazy golden brew. Aroma is of course wheat and pale malts.. slight spicy hoppiness. Good body for the style and sorta creamy carbonation. Wheat and husky pale malts with only a touch of spicy hop flavor.. the brew leans towards the malts. I don’t know what else to say; I don’t even try to pretend to enjoy American wheats... just not my thing. It is good for its style and I like Workhorse more than Widmer Hefe, but that’s not saying much."
Grand Teton Workhorse Wheat;Victor, Idaho, United States;Wheat Ale;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;gold pour with a thin white head. aroma is wheat malt, light banana and malt. hint of clove spice. very light though. flavour is light citrusy lemon and light banana, cardboard-ish wheat malt body. pretty drinkable.

McMenamins Golden Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Draught at Thompsons in Salem Ok beer, light weight with some light lemony type hopping. Mouthfeelis pretty good for the style. I was however put off a bit by a rougher rough earthy taste that sort of clashed with the light hopping. Overll average even for McMenamins.

McMenamins Amber Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Had on tap with a light orangey color and a coffee that tingles the nose. Very dry in taste. Not what I expected in an amber ale, but a clean finish and is worth a try.

McMenamins Amber Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;When i got this glass I thought the waiter was joking that it was an amber, and im still skeptical. Looks like a hefeweizen, orange and cloudy with a small white head. Smelled Fruity, sweet, and hoppy. Tasted like an IPA, started sweet then the hops made it very bitter, kinda lousy amber but a decent IPA taste.

Independence Oatmeal Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Independence Brew Pub;had at the brewpub, and must admit i was disappointed by this. maybe I caught it on a bad day, but it seemed to lack something, it was possibly overly roast/burnt, and just wasn’t easy to drink
Independence Oatmeal Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Independence Brew Pub;"Date: 07/26/2007 Mode: Draft Source: Brewpub black, fine tan head, drippy scattered lace, light roasted malt aroma, sweet chocolate and roasted flavor, sweet vanilla character, light roasted character Aroma: 6/10; Appearance: 7/10; Flavor: 6/10; Palate: 7/10; Overall: 12/20 Rating: 3.2/5.0 Drinkability: 7/10 Score: **/4"

Independence Oatmeal Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Independence Brew Pub;Sampled on draught at the brewpub in Philadelphia, PA. Pours to a jet black color, with a thick, creamy, tan head, and a soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is very nice, with lots of good dark chocolate, sweet malt, and fruity estery aroma of black currant. The palate is soft, silky, and creamy, with good flavors of chocolate, lightly roasted coffee, and estery flavor of currant. This beer finishes with more good dark chocolate, and coffee flavors up front, then ends with a slightly bitter sweet dark chocolate flavor that lingers. A very creamy, and delcious, sweet stout. Makes for a nice beer to enjoy at the brewpub, and an ideal match with the deserts on the menu. My favorite of all the Independence beers I tried.
Independence Oatmeal Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Independence Brew Pub;Best beer they’ve got on tap. Cood coffee bean aroma. Very nice looks black with a very tight creamy light brown head, lots of lace. Flavor is perfect mocha, a smooth, milky blend of coffee and chocolate, and sweet. palate is smooth but slightly watery. Nice beer, enough to give me some faith in this brewer.
Independence Oatmeal Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Independence Brew Pub;Had this at the brew pub from the hand pump cask. I thourghouly enjoyed this. It was like a guiness, but not crappy. Because it was hand pumped from the cask it had that guiness consistency, but it was backed up by a great toasty creamy chocolate flavor.
Independence Oatmeal Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Independence Brew Pub;"""Poured black with a little tan head. Lacing was great. Roasty chocolate aroma. Flavor was of toasted oats, chocolate. Mouthfeel was nice and creamy. """
Independence Oatmeal Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Independence Brew Pub;Eh... not bad. The nitorgen infusion mellows out the taste. Actually not very powerful in the mouth but seemed a bit on the choclate side and not too earthy. Was a decent drinking beer.
Independence Oatmeal Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Independence Brew Pub;Nitro-tap to give it light creaminess, not overdone. Roast, smooth. Sour and malt and milk,coffee, sugary malty. Opaque black with mocha head.
Three Clear;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gunn Island Brewbar;Clear orange colour, compact head, need muscles just to lift the glass, orange in there giving sweetness, should have had a middy, flat grainy boring aroma with a harsh follow through initially in the taste that comes and goes.
Three Clear;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gunn Island Brewbar;Draught at AIBA, Melbourne. Clear golden. Light on grass and fruit. Dry with clean (but not hard) mouthfeel. Flavours are restrained, and the finish is carefully bitter. Unspectacular, but flawless and obviously well made.
Three Clear;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gunn Island Brewbar;2 July 2004 - Brewed at Gunn Island brewery at this stage. Fruit malt hop and slightly metallic aroma. Orange clear colour, reasonable good head, with delicate lacing. Slight fruit starting flavour, but hugely metallic, simplistic-linear hops. A long lingering, clinging finish like many aussie beers, maybe Pride of Ringwood hops are being used. The staff claim that Hersbrucker Hallertau is being used, if so only for aroma. Thin gutless beer that is a bit fizzy.
Three Clear;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gunn Island Brewbar;Aroma: Malty, fruity but with noticeable metallic notes stinking it up. Apperance: Orange, clear, good head and good lacing. Flavour: definate formaldahyde, sticky metallic flavour without the aroma promised malt. Very one dimensional. Palate: Thin and with lasting clingy bitter metal. Overall: I warmed this up to a normal drinkable temperate (from the insane 3 degrees) but maybe I should have drunk it freezing and not bothered to taste it. I am sure this is massively oxidised. Perhaps will be better when it’s brewed on premises rather than off premises.
Three Clear;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gunn Island Brewbar;Sampled AIBA 2004. A Vienna lager according to the brewer. Medium rust brown with light carbonation. Nice malty aroma but without a lot of actual flavour.
Three Clear;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gunn Island Brewbar;Gold colour, good solid head. Lightly malty aroma, not much going on, some herbs in there. Fairly solid body, nice light malt character (though it’s obvious the beer uses Australian malts) and a reasonable PoR bitterness which teeters on being a bit overwhelming but actually works pretty well. It’s nothing special, but nor does it pretend to be, which gains some points with me. I’m disappointed that this is the only beer this brewery is currently producing but hopefully they’ll make some more interesting stuff.
Johansson's 80 Schilling Scottish Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Scottish Ale;Johansson's Dining House;Murky, burnt orange ale with a small, creamy, khaki head. Fair retention. Malty aroma with notes of chocolate, oak and beef drippings. The flavor is perfectly-balanced, but extremely thin and watery. Light-bodied with fizzy carbonation and a dry finish.
Johansson's Irish Amber;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Johansson's Dining House;Well-balanced and unoffensive, but mostly tastes and smells like seltzer water. Nice, very light milk chocolate notes within the nose and flavor, but that’s about all. Light-bodied with a dry mouthfeel, fizzy carbonation and a short, crisp, clean finish. Some malt and hops would've been nice. Lawnmower ale!

Girardin Faro;Sint Ulriks-Kapelle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Brouwerij Girardin;Bottle. Pours amber bronze with some murk and a little head. Aroma is funk, lemon iced tea, artificial sweetener. Caramel, malts, vanilla, iced tea all on top of a mild funky lambic. Light and easy. The finish seemingly ends with light sourness but what really lingers is this kind of herbal tea bitterness. Strange style Faro beer. Defo my least favorite among wild beers. This is drinkable though.

Finishes sweet, a bit dry, moderate wooden, sugary, a bit fruity, with slight funk. OK. The nose is quite interesting, but the taste is too sweet, with too much sugar and quite simple. My bottle also seems a bit oxidized. Still quite good to drink, not the worst style example I've had. Score: 7 / 4 / 6 / 3 / 13

Sticky in the mouth, and with the flavour profile, this is fitting indeed. Wow, what an unexpected beer, with a crazy sour finish. Orange and lemon is initially quite gentle and smooth, but once it gets over your tongue things go mental, with a sour wave that verges on Flemish Sour territory. Extremely tangy, mouth puckering even. Nice, unusual, and well done, although you’d struggle to do a session on this.

Ottakringer Radler;Wien, Austria;Radler / Shandy;Ottakringer;Can: Thanks to my friend Susann: Pale yellow pour, good clairty with a thin white head. Lemon drop candy aroma. No discernable beer qualities. Very light palate. Flavor is dominated by a soft sugary sweetness that’s quite nondescript. Some lemon candy notes with no bitterness. It doesn’t seem too artificial. I’d prefer this over the mainstream examples (Budlight Lime). Eh.

Ottakringer Radler;Wien, Austria;Radler / Shandy;Ottakringer;01/08 A 0.5 l can from Interspar Udine. It poured pale yellow body with medium sized head that typically went down fast. Artificial lemony aroma, thus boring. Flavor was hardly any improvement, dominated by strange make of bitter spice that is otherwise usual in Austrian radlers, and some artificial sweetener. Finish is more sweet however. All in all, a lower quality radler.
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);16-Mar-13 (12-oz bottle: Purchased 16-Mar-13 for $3.49 at The Bine & Vine Bottle Shop in San Diego, CA) I had this 6 years ago and liked it, but it's now available in SoCal, so I might as well give it another try. The beer pours a hazy, copper body with half an inch of off-white head that settles to a thin, unbroken sheet, leaving spotting lacing on the glass. Hops provides piney and fairly floral aromas while the malt is on the grainy and cereal side, with a bit of cheesiness in the background. On the palate, the hops are floral, grassy, and gently piney with moderate bitterness. Malts are cereal in flavor with some caramely character and medium sweetness. It's medium-plus in weight, average in carbonation, and somewhat drying from the hops. Overall, this Imperial IPA comes across as just average for the style, not bad, but not memorable either. I guess I'm pretty apathetic in general and I have no great desire to retaste this in the future. (6, 3, 6, 3, 13 = 3.1) 14-Jan-07 (22 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with whaleman, thanks David!) 471 Small Batch is unfortunately so small a batch, they didn't have enough beer to fill all the bottles properly. A very low fill here, the beer barely reaches the base of the neck of this bomber and unsurprisingly, the beer is a bit oxidized and tasting somewhat bready. But overlooking this, the sweet, caramely maltiness is a strong component and is balanced nicely by a piney and citrusy hoppiness with the moderate bitterness extending the finish quite some time. The beer seems fairly alcoholic, something I didn't expect from an aged beer. Medium-full in body with ample carbonation, but there is enough sweet maltiness here to prevent the hops from imparting a meaningful crispness in the finish to help combat the oxidation. The nose is sweet and malty, but fruity and modestly hoppy. Orange-amber in color and fairly hazy, especially on the second pour when sediment is released from the bottle. The tall, fluffy, off-white head settles unevenly, resulting in deep holes burrowed into the fluffy surroundings. Lacing is significant, delicate in structure and long-lasting. Smooth and easy-drinking, yet rich, malty and fairly bitter, so this is a well-rounded beer And since I'm not all that bothered by oxidation, this aspect seems to meld well with the other flavors, though it keeps me from wanting to drink more than a pint or so. (7, 4, 7, 3, 14 = 3.5)
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);12oz bottle from Beer Run. Aromas of citrus fruit, grapefruit, orange, some pine, somewhat herbal. Clear deep orange with a somewhat lasting white head. Dry, nicely bitter, pretty well balanced. Medium-full bodied.
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Caramal malt combined with Pacific Northwest hops. Fairly bittered and dry in the finish.
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);From Feb 2008 I had this on tap at the Fire Rock Grill Feb 23, 2008. The pour reveals a cloudy rust gold with a 1 finger head of foam. Good head retention here and there's some very nice lacing. The smell is on the delicate side. All I get is some light notes of malt and floral hops. The taste is...my...very well balanced. It's big on caramel malt and biscuit, with some earthy tones, and big with the hop bitterness, both from some grapefruit and some floral, but the sweet-bitter thing going on here works very well! The mouthfeel is firmly on the medium side and it finishes with a slight bitterness that makes you want to take another sip. So easy drinking for the abv that it's scary. Btw, I was served this pint in a frosted glass,(I'll correct that next time I'm here) and as the beer warmed, all the flavours intensified and I enjoyed it even more. I think this is a very solid, very balanced, very easy drinking DIPA and I'm going to revisit the draught version, just $4.25 a pint, soon.(Botttles are still not in town)
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Had from draft at Melt bar and grill. Light scent, medium golden color, light semi sweet taste without much aftertaste. Not a strong heavy IPA but had a high alcohol content (9-10%). Pretty good summer IPA ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle shared in MV. Pours unclear orange with a frothy, off-white head. The aroma has some rich bready malts, well ripened citrus, some berries. Medium sweet flavour with ample toasted caramel, more grainy malts, citrus peel. Medium to full bodied with fine carbonation. Finishes with light warmth, wigh some mild resinous pine, more citrus rind, some marmalade. A little punchy but not bad overall.
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Had this brew on tap at Breck Brewing in Littleton. This is a malty, tasty, strong IPA. Carmel in color. There’s a lot of IBU in this brew, but not as much nose or finish as some. Not arguing w the brewmaster’s description, about more hoppiness than you’ve ever tasted, butthe maltiness nicely counterbalances the generous hopping of this DIPA. Tastes like a hoppy Imperial pale ale. Amazing!

Breckenridge 471 Small Batch IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle. Amber colored with a big foamy off-white head that has good retention. The aroma is decent with pine, citrus and toffee. The taste was a bit of a letdown, I found this bitter just for bitters sake--no real hop flavor--like they dumped a boatload of magnum in the boil at flame on. The principal flavor was overly sweet caramel, and very bitter caramel at that. Bit of candied cardboard in there too. The palate was medium and a bit sticky. Overall: Im sure this would have been a first rate IPA in 2007, but today it just does not tickle my fancy..
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Purchased the first time I saw a four pack at a local HEB. Glad I did. Out of the bottle it comes a super nice hazy orange liquid putting up a thinnish white top. The nose is resin with some caramel. Tasting it I get a moderate hop kick, maltiness, surprising for an IPA and a toffee-like sweetness. The bitterness is present throughout. I detect the 9.2% abv lingering in the background. Brewer should be proud.

Lovely bright brown-amber beer, maltier in the nose than the flavor, which has some light toasted sweetness. Releases a bit of fruit when swirled, which I find reassuringly unpolished. Nicely rough, dry bitterness, very light sweetness, light bitter aftertaste. High on character and drinkability so scores well with me."

Other than that...its well made.
Chicago Daisy Chain Tripel;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Tripel;Chicago Brewing Company;(Draft: 2004 Strong Ale Festival, Pizza Port in Carlsbad, CA. Day 2, Beer 8) Chicago Brewing Company is located in … Las Vegas!!? Huh? Well, it smells like a tripel, albeit, not an especially aromatic one. Candi sweetness, light spice, moderate bubblegum are all in the nose. The flavor is moderately sweet with some bubblegum and light spice. Lightly bitter as well. The palate has average viscosity, but I’ve had many tripels with a more substantial mouthfeel than this one. Pale golden color. Whitish head is bubbly, and maintains the thin layer for a bit, but eventually fades to a sheen. Some modest lace here and there. This is decent, but the flavor just seems a bit light and watered down. Come on guys, let loose!

Second Street St. George IPA;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Second Street Brewery;On tap at Second Street Downtown. Pours a clear orange with a white head. Aroma of light fruits, floral hops, and bready malt. Flavor of bready and pale malts, bitter hops, and floral hops. Definitely quite hoppy but it also a solid malt presence. It reminded me more of a really hoppy pale vs. your standard IPA. Great stuff though! I liked it better than their regular IPA. 7/4/8/4/15 [3.8/5]
Second Street St. George IPA;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Second Street Brewery;On tap. Pour is a very nice looking deep orange to red color. Aroma of caramel, orange, and fruit. Flavor is nicely balanced. Starts with citrus flavors and some bitterness which gives way to malt sweetness and some fruitiness. Finish is crisp, bitter, and slightly dry. Enjoyed this one quite a bit.
Second Street St. George IPA;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Second Street Brewery;Tap at the Brewery, prefer this IPA over there standard to be honest. Floral, earthy, hops and caramel malts. Flavor has a strong bitterness quickly followed by a slightly deep sweetness. Fairly easy drinking. Decent stuff.
Second Street St. George IPA;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Second Street Brewery;Poured a medium orange with very slight chill haze. Nose was weak on hops, mostly just caramel and some bitter floral hops. Taste was fairly big on the malt sweetness, bittering hops were a little harsh, mostly floral and earthy hops. not a lot of hop flavor.
Second Street St. George IPA;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Second Street Brewery;Draught. Pours hazy gold-amber with a small white head and spotty lacing. Fruit citrus hop and caramel malt aroma. Bitter hop (floral, citrus) and malt and yeast flavor. Medium bodied and clean palate. I’ll have to agree with the consensus that this is an English IPA, as opposed to their regular IPA.
Second Street St. George IPA;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Second Street Brewery;Rich, copper-orange hue. Smooth and nicely carbonated. Had an English IPA slant. Still, pretty big citrus flavors (grapefruit, orange and tangerine), but not acidic citrus. Malts were more predominant, with notes of cocoa and light toffee. Crisp and clean and easy-drinking. Not over-the-top in any way, but still tasty and solid.
Second Street St. George IPA;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Second Street Brewery;"Pours similar to all of the second street pale ales and bitters. Lite amber, clear, with a tightly knit white head. Aroma of grapefruits and grass. Not as hoppy or as complex in the flavors as the IPA. A little thin too. Grapefruits and that;s about it for the flavor. Just Ok, stick with the IPA."
Second Street St. George IPA;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Second Street Brewery;This is different from the regular Second Street IPA and I tasted both side by side. The St. George IPA is more English in style. It has a deep copper body (a shade darker than the original IPA), mild carbonation, and a thin soapy white head. Very fruity, apple-citrus nose. Considerably hoppy, piney flavor. Aroma hops seem English while the bittering hops seem to be a mixture of English and American. Decent, but inferior to their American-style IPA in my book.
Cottage Stephensons Gold;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cottage Brewing;Cask Handpump at the Smithfield Hotel, Manchester 17/03/2002 Straw golden colour and slightly rich on the palate. Fruity with a pleasant hop finish.
Cottage Stephensons Gold;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cottage Brewing;"Well, what a surprise - another Cottage ""occasional"". Appealing clear gold colour, but there is nothing very distinct in the aroma. The flavour is rather grassy with a slight musty note in the background. Quite clean but short of hop bite. Hints of malt. Quite light bodied. The finish is soft, tending towards flabbiness, with a sweetish honey tang. OK, but undistinguished. Cask (handpump), Head of Steam, Euston, London NW1."

Archers Hopscotch;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Deep amber with little nose. Usual rich sweet maltiness and a vague hint of dryness. Too sweet for me and not very Scottish either. (Cask @ Orwell, Wigan)
Archers Hopscotch;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Nice pale amber colour. Indistinct aroma. The flavour is rather odd. From the name I would guess there is some whisky malt in here (see also His Lordship’s Whisky Beer from the same brewery). It also has a rather sappy character on the palate and the combination is not too successful. The grassy notes continue in the lingering finish, but there is a tinny edge too. Medium bodied. Cask (handpump), Head of Steam, Euston, London NW1.

Fruity, red wine, malty, peaty, chocolate notes, coffee. Bitter. Watery palate, Dry finish.

Phoenix Black Shadow;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Mild Ale;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);16th April 2010. Very dark brown beer but it is clear. Dry palate, very dry. Bitterish dark malt and underlying hop that also imparts bitterness. There is a pleasant tang in the middle. Overall this beer is way too dry and too one dimensional in it’s bitterness.
Phoenix Black Shadow;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Mild Ale;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);"The High Cross, Leicester. As good as impenetrable with a glint of ruby at the edges; loose yellow-tan collar, maps of tan daubing the glass. Big carbon and alpha presence (or so I thought); hints of tangerine running under inedibly charred toast, ash, touch of cardboard. Perfumey citrus hop and blackened toast aroma. Very US; could do with a notch more creaminess to soften the hop and carbon. I’m nit-picking. Excellent, not-very mild."
Phoenix Black Shadow;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Mild Ale;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);[Cask at the Monks Retreat, Reading] Nice smokey aroma, tastes of earth & coffee with slight ashy hints, but it’s all a bit muted. Dry finish.

Roosters Outlaw Ringo;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Roosters Brewing;Cask (handpump) at the Devereux, Holborn. You can generally have a fair idea of what you are going to get with a Roosters beer - golden colour and plenty of hops. This one does not break the mould, although its not as aromatic as some . Gold/straw colour. Fruity hop burst on the nose. More grassy than floral. Juicy, grassy and herbaceous in the mouth. Some citrus and guava. Light bodied. Fresh, clean and crisp. Very refreshing.

Harvest Moon Maibock;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);I’ve always loved Maibocks and this one stands right up with the rest of the ones I’ve tried so far. This offering pours a dark yellow / light gold color with small white head. The nose is very sweet, with caramel, floral hops, yeast and bread.

Harvest Moon Maibock;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);Draft at HM. Pours a moderate dark copper color with a small white head. Aroma is of light grains, fruit, caramel, and maybe a touch of that bland noble hop bitterness. Taste is grainy bread, caramel, light fruit skins, toast and once again some of that noble hop character creeping in there for light bitterness.
Harvest Moon Maibock;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);on draft: poured golden brown with small tan head that didnt linger around. the nose malty, the mouth and feel was malty sweet a little chewy, too sweet for my taste, almost unfermented. no hop character.....next!

Bergedorf;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);0,33 l can. Pours crystal clear (I can actually see my fingerprint through the glass), light golden with a finger of quite dense medium lasting white head. Aroma is minimal, a tiny bit of cardboard, some very light grainy aroma and that's about it. Taste is light sweet, hardly any bitterness. Body is light, texture on the watery side and carbonation above average. Finish is very short, a bit of bitterness comes from somewhere and fades immediately. Non offensive, but completely pointless...

In any case, clear golden pour with two finger soapy white head. Goes away almost instantly. Smell is malty and grainy, slightly sweet. Thin body with regular carbonation. Watery texture. Aroma and taste.... nothing to write home about. Usual macro supermarket lager. Bittersweet combination of malts, grains, corn and metal. Watery and boring. Cheap beer, but drinkable.

FILO Cardinal;Hastings, East Sussex, England;Porter;FILO Brewing;Cask at the Eastbourne Beer Festival, 9th Oct 2008. Pitch black appearance with a little cream head. Soft medicinal herb and berry notes on the nose lead you onward to a an intense coffee start to the sip but then the flavour broadens out to include more berry flavours and roasted notes. A very interesting and challenging porter with lots of fun flavours.
FILO Cardinal;Hastings, East Sussex, England;Porter;FILO Brewing;A Sim rate (cask at Hove BF): Red wine and sweetness in the aroma, but not nearly enough to warrant a nice porter. Dark colour, but not quite opaque. Biscuity, bitter malt flavour that’s so so bitter in the finish. Such a watery palate. It’s such a letdown. I got a half pint of this and a taster of the Bottlewreck porter. I should’ve done it the other way ’round. Didn’t even finish this beer.
FILO Cardinal;Hastings, East Sussex, England;Porter;FILO Brewing;[639-20070919] Cask @ First In Last Out (Hastings, ES). Malty coffee roast aroma. Clear, dark brown red body with a small long-lasting foamy white head. Coffee malt flavour. Medium-full body is smooth. Interesting porter.
FILO Cardinal;Hastings, East Sussex, England;Porter;FILO Brewing;FILO, Hastings Soft, mildly creamy, with an embracing blanket of ducks down. Flavoursome without weight or aggression. Hints of coffee, chocolate and roast, as expected from a dark beer. Soft hopping bitterness. Everything is here, but in a restrained manner - and that is well suited to the soft and comforting mouthfeel. Soft, jammy raspberry fruit near the finish, and jelly in the swallow. Charming.
FILO Cardinal;Hastings, East Sussex, England;Porter;FILO Brewing;Cask conditioned @ FILO, Hastings. Dark berries and malt. Fruity acidity goes well with the light roasty flavours.
FILO Cardinal;Hastings, East Sussex, England;Porter;FILO Brewing;Cask@The Sussex Beer festival, Hove. Quite sweet, with notable caramel/toffee characters. Very subtle roasted characters, very soft, vanishing flavours. This tasted like a mild to me.

More toffee and coffee on end with minimum dry powder. Depends what you want. Fine, but not exciting.

Hogs Back Dark Mild;Tongham, Surrey, England;Mild Ale;Hogs Back Brewery;Cask@Readin BF. No aroma, no flavour, very ’mild’ indeed, but this mild to the point of almost being non-existent. Something grainy is happening i guess, but the mouthfeel is almost completetly empty. Watery.
Hogs Back Dark Mild;Tongham, Surrey, England;Mild Ale;Hogs Back Brewery;Gravity at Reading Beer Fest, with Kook, Duff, Chris_o and Joeh. Light red/brown, no head. Very boring, tasteless beer. Some pilsbury baked product flavour, but not much else. Some grease, which is boring and possibly worse.

Hogs Back Dark Mild;Tongham, Surrey, England;Mild Ale;Hogs Back Brewery;Cask @ Reading Festival. Watery mild with trace character of malt, fruit and sweetness. A little bitterness in there also.
Hogs Back Dark Mild;Tongham, Surrey, England;Mild Ale;Hogs Back Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Market Porter, Borough, London . Brown with a beige foaming head, settling down quickly. Very little aroma (typical of the cask ale but more so at the Market Porter). Chocolate and mocha flavours, other coffee notes as well. Clean and true.
Blind Tiger Chief Burnetts IPA;Topeka, Kansas, United States;IPA;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;Growler. Really missing something. The PNW hops are used well here, but there was hardly any malt! The aroma began with plenty of resiny citrus hop, a tad floral. Flavor much the same, with an extremely light, almost watery body, leading to a firm bitterness in the finish, with a lingering grapefruit. Nice amber color with a fluffy head.
Blind Tiger Chief Burnetts IPA;Topeka, Kansas, United States;IPA;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub. The body was dark orange with a white head. The aroma was caramel and grapefruit. The taste was toast with some bread crust and toffee. There was also a hint of hops. The was decently bitter, but no way this should be called an IPA. Possibly, it coudl be an English style IPA.
Blind Tiger Chief Burnetts IPA;Topeka, Kansas, United States;IPA;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub. Copper with no head. High citrus hop aroma with some bready malt aroma in the background. Tons of hop flavor. Bitter as hell but not harsh. A touch fruity. Medium body. Pleasant. Not extraordinary, but well made nonetheless.
Blind Tiger Chief Burnetts IPA;Topeka, Kansas, United States;IPA;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;BIG flowery aroma comes with this reddish-amber one, followed with the promised big hop flavors ... dry and robust. This was the best I had in 5 weekend brewpub stops. Excellent.
Blind Tiger Chief Burnetts IPA;Topeka, Kansas, United States;IPA;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;Cask-conditioned: Speckled, mucky pumpkin. Loose, spongy, off-white head. Slick body, soft and round. Mellow flavors of orange pulp and soft floral tones. Mildly sweet maltiness smoothens the subtle citrus rind sharpness. Trace acidity at the center alongside juicy apricots. Finishes a tad spicier and more assertive than when it started, with sweet honeyed malts and orange pulp. Predictable, boring C-hop aroma and far too little maltiness to beef up the body. Very average.
Spendrups Röd Lager;Grängesberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spendrups Bryggeri;The color is very nice red amber and the head is huge and creamy. The aroma is sweetish, fruity and malty. The flavour is sweetish with light notes of fruit, a lot of malt and a dry grapefruit. The bitterness is low, and it ends with light notes of caramel and licorice. It’s quite interesting and a bit surprising!
Spendrups Röd Lager;Grängesberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spendrups Bryggeri;Canned. Amber with an ok off-white head. Some burnt toffee in the sweetish aroma. A lot of co2. Fine maltiness with chocolate- and toffee-notes.
Spendrups Röd Lager;Grängesberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spendrups Bryggeri;Can. Pours deep, clear red with a medium off-white head. Fruity, nutty, slightly roasted malt aroma with a faint hint of hops. Medium bodied and quite smooth. Medium sweet flavour with a decent bitterness in the finish. OK but not very interesting Vienna.
Spendrups Röd Lager;Grängesberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spendrups Bryggeri;500 ml can. Reddish light copper colour. Crystal clear. Very tall light beige head. The fluffy head clings lightly to the glass. Sharp citrusy and soapy aroma. Soft texture and little carbonation to be detected on the tongue. Some münchenermalt flavours. Light-bodied and lacks a bit malt body. Next to no noticeable hop bitterness. Bland, but drinkable. I had expected more character.
Spendrups Röd Lager;Grängesberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spendrups Bryggeri;(50 cl can from Systembolaget) Labeled 5.2%. Clear walnut brownish dark color, creamy but small tan head.

Spendrups Röd Lager;Grängesberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spendrups Bryggeri;Light copper colour, you could almost say it is red, as I’m assuming is the intention of the brewer. Head is large and bubbly. Flavour and body is better than your average spendrups, not that this is a big thing. There is minimal hop character, and a very basic malt profile. The finish is clean and dry.

Prösslbräu Adlersberg Palmator Doppelbock;Adlersberg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Prösslbräu Adlersberg;"Flasche (50 cl) von Getränke Frizzz, Regensburg. - Tiefstes Kastanienbraun, klar (soweit erkennbar). - In der Nase schwarzer Kaffee, Pflaume, leicht weinige Noten, dicht aber vornehm und keinesfalls fuselig. - Antrunk gediegen röstmalzig mit (wenig) Rohrzucker, Pflaumenmus und einem Touch spritziger Säure. Für einen Doppelbock gut rezent - etwas weniger Kohlensäure würde ihm guttun. Im Abgang mehr füllige Malzsüße und mild krautige Herbe, die gerade ausreicht, um die Malzfülle zu grundieren. Den Alkohol schmeckt man kaum. - Schöner Doppelbock, sehr rund und gediegen, weder breit noch fuselig; für einen Doppelbock beinahe schlank. Gelungen. (Alte Bewertung, 21.4.2015: 3,3.) Neuverkostung: vom Faß beim Prößlbräu. - Etwas süßer, frischer und lebendiger als aus der Flasche. Vorzüglicher Doppelbock. (30.4.2019.)"
Prösslbräu Adlersberg Palmator Doppelbock;Adlersberg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Prösslbräu Adlersberg;My Bottom Line: Candied dark fruit, molasses and caramel lead to earthy hops and toasted sugars in this rich Doppelbock. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the hazy dark brown. -Alcohol is well hidden throughout. -Carbonation, in the tap version, was a bit too much for the style, imho. -The bottle proved to be more polished and totally world-class within its category. Above rating is an average of both tap and bottle experiences. On tap at the brewery and from the bottle.

Es ist ein klassisches Dunkles bayrischen Stils. Es ist nicht zu süß und hat angehme Röstaromen vermischt mit malziger Basis.

Good start, not so well finish.
Prösslbräu Adlersberg Jubiläums Dunkel;Adlersberg, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Prösslbräu Adlersberg;My Bottom Line: Nuts and toffee thrive in a velvety mouthfeel, as light minerality and hops color the finish. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam sits atop the attractive mahogany. -Carbonation is once again a tad excessive in this tap version. -This is as good as their Palmator Doppelbock, but it is obviously more drinkable. -Malts are well defined throughout.

Boulder Beer Sweaty Betty Blonde;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boulder Beer Company;Draught. Pours yellow with a small white head. Aroma is clove and banana bread. Taste is dough/bread, clove, coriander, light banana, and a hint of earth. Bitter finish. Too much coriander. Light+ body. Moderate carbonation. Crisp-ish mouthfeel with a slight doughy creaminess. I'd prefer a hefeweizen with a little citrus to it - although anything would be helpful to give this one a little life.
Boulder Beer Sweaty Betty Blonde;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boulder Beer Company;At first I thought this was pretty much an average beer, but as I got further down the 6-pack it kinda grew on me. Pretty much a wheaty/yeasty beer, but a smooth and crisp one. Been about a year or so since I tried it, but saw it in the store which reminded me to review. I thought it was worth the try, but didn't really stand out much. There are probably better choices out there for this style. Refreshing though for a hot day, or just for something lighter for a change of pace.

Aroma: sweet, cloying malt with notes of light toffee, honey, fresh raspberry & blueberry smoothie, earthy malt, and a hint of pepper or rhubarb.

Hollolan Hirvi Kivisahti;Hollola, Finland;Gotlandsdricke/ Koduõlu/ Sahti;Hollolan Hirvi;My Bottom Line: Caramelized rye and touch of juniper earthiness are met by mildly acidic fruitiness in this simple and efficient Sahti. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam circles the hazy amber. -Drinkability is high on this one, especially if you are drinking it fresh out of their smoke sauna. -Not quite sure how the stones affect the flavor profile, but they must have had their effect since this Sahti was quite unique flavor-wise. -Body was surprisingly lean, which is a rarity in the Sahti world where the final gravity is pretty much always sweeter than 1030.

Tryst Brockville Pale;Larbert, Central, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tryst Brewery;On tap at the Red Squirrel. Appearance - golden with a nice head. Nose - screaming citrus particularly grapefruit. Taste - grapefruit confirmed with just a hint of pale malt in rhe background. Palate - light to medium bodied with a long refreshing finish. Overall - what a palate cleanser. That would take the taste of doner kebabs away.

Greenfield Friezland Ale;Greenfield, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greenfield Brewery;Cask Conditioned at The White Lion, Fewcott. Dark brown almost opaque tan head. Masses of flavour in this dark bitter, which I would almost describe as a porter. Chocolate roasted malt predominates with a coffee huskiness and plummy fruit. In amongst all this is a bitterness that lasts. Hard to define, but a well crafted beer.

Nørrebro Royal Hobart Ale;København, Denmark;Pale Ale - English;Nørrebro Bryghus;Tap, at the brewpub May 2004. Amber, moderate white head and gentle condition. Low fruity malt aromas with some developing but subdued hop notes. Much the same in the mouth, both the malt and hops jostle briefly for attention but soon realise no one cares and give up. Bitter hops seize the opportunity and assert themselves in the finish.
Nørrebro Royal Hobart Ale;København, Denmark;Pale Ale - English;Nørrebro Bryghus;"Draught at Nørrebro Bryghus; served in Nørrebro Bryghus glass with stem. Orange-gold color. Fresh aroma with flowery hop presence; the taste is bitter, dominated by the hops, has good bite and some sweetness, especially in the finish; pleasant, lively mouthfeel; good drinkability."

Nørrebro Royal Hobart Ale;København, Denmark;Pale Ale - English;Nørrebro Bryghus;Sampled draught at Dansk Ølfestival. Deep golden, almost clear. Fruity malt is dominating. Dortmunder-like dense, sweet maltiness. Low hop rate, just some bitterness.

Doyles Fishermans Lager;Sydney, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle enjoyed during a holiday in Australia. Backlog rating from bottle collection and historic scoring. Source - Doyles Restaurant, Watson's Bay. Tasting notes not kept, just rating. Scoring at the time possibly influenced by the fantastic location!
Doyles Fishermans Lager;Sydney, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);(Bottle) Clear golden yellow with no head. Pleasant subtle aroma - citrus and hints of honey. Palate is smooth with restrained but pleasant carbonation. Taste is smooth with slightly honey sweetness and good malt with citrus hints and a decent bitter finish. Overall a nice lager.
Doyles Fishermans Lager;Sydney, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);12oz bottle @ Doyles in Watson’s Bay AU, this is decent, and goes well with Calamari and Tuna, this drinks easy and suits me just fine on a hot day, had to try this because AU is still proving to be a wasteland for hoppy beer.
Doyles Fishermans Lager;Sydney, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);bottled. sure enough at the fish markets. decent olden appearance with a light head. german hop aroma - grassy and inviting. light bitterness, decent texture, quite crisp, some vanilla malt sweetness
Doyles Fishermans Lager;Sydney, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);At the Fish Markets with some great calamari (I’m such a tourist). Darker than expected - solid orange - clear with no head retention though I was drinking from a plastic cup of unknown cleanliness. Pretty decent Helles-type beer. Malt is solid, enough hop at the end to make it interesting. Quite fizzy. Some mild vanilla. Has that flavour that everything tastes like when I’m hungover. Easily the best thing to come out of Blue Tongue but that doesn’t mean much.
Doyles Fishermans Lager;Sydney, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);It must be the smell of the fish. Lets not worry about the beer they say, just serve up a beer that will refressh. Would it? Sure, but just like any other average lager that is given the poison chalice of ’premium’. I prefer a good crisp Semillon Suavignon Blanc with my fresh seafood here in the absence of a good beer. The scene here is clearly skewed towards the wine crowd.
Doyles Fishermans Lager;Sydney, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottled, at the Sydney Fish Markets, Pyrmont. Clearly a contract brew but as they don’t currently claim to do larger this must be an original. Golden larger with large bubbles. Thin malty aroma. Fairly average beer, shame really then that I halled the damn thing all the way to Mabul Island in far east Malaysia to drink. Anyway you get that sometimes.

Camas Prairie Palouse Gold Mead;Moscow, Idaho, United States;Mead;Camas Prairie Winery;Bottle: Pours a golden green apple color that’s still. The nose is fresh with some apple and honey notes, fairly floral with an obvious sign of ample sweetness. The flavor has a moderate sweet impact with a syrupy mouthfeel and a relatively complex finish. Good for the style, but a bit too sweet and cloying for my liking. Alas, I had to dump it.

Camas Prairie Strawberry Mead;Moscow, Idaho, United States;Mead;Camas Prairie Winery;Bottle: Dark red kool aid color. Nose of sweet medicinal instant fruit drink along with alcohol and some fermentation byproducts, very light honey notes. The flavor is astringent and very sweet. Not quite something you’d want to give a woman who prefers a sweeter drink, it has a syruppy bitterness to it that’s almost like strawberry seeds or something. Drinkable, would be good with the right meal, something like duck a l’orange or something.
Camas Prairie Idaho Tej Mead;Moscow, Idaho, United States;Mead;Camas Prairie Winery;Light beige color with a green tint. The nose is lightly funky with herbal hops, vanilla, and some earthy honey notes. The flavor is sweet, lightly bitter like just a brief afterthought, not very upfront or noticable. In the produce deparment I’m seeing granny smiths, pears and starfruit. There’s some dusty woody notes like you find in a geueze or a normandy cider. Attractive and complex but not something I’d seek out usually.

The Brew Kettle Felonious Funk Belgian Wit;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Brew Kettle;This beer pours a slightly hazy yellow-gold color with a medium white head that recedes steadily to an outer ring. Strings of lacing on the glass. Fruit, wheat and malt in the nose. Light-bodied with flavors of mildly funky citrus, herbal yeast and malt. The finish is fruity with a citrus and yeast aftertaste. Above average overall.
The Brew Kettle Felonious Funk Belgian Wit;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Brew Kettle;Dark gold. It’s a bit hazy at the beginning as the yeast has settled. At the end of the bottle, it gets cloudier. Beautiful aroma. Ripe bananas, bubblegum, orange and coriander. Slight phenols. Flowery. The wheat provides a firm background to the soft fruitiness of the esters and spicing of the orange peel and coriander, although the esters almost overpower the spice. Really seems more like a spiced hefeweizen than a witbier, but it’s tasty.
The Brew Kettle Felonious Funk Belgian Wit;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Brew Kettle;"Hazy golden; poured with a huge head that slowly settled, very nice lacing. Coriander is the predominant spice, some other herbs, citrus. Taste is light but flavorful - orange, lemon tartness, clove, coriander. finishes with a light orange peel bitterness. Even though the body seems thin, this is a very refreshing beer."
The Brew Kettle Felonious Funk Belgian Wit;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Brew Kettle;Bottle: Hazy light amber hue with fizzy fading head and some lace. The aroma has notes of coriander, juniper berries, orange zest, lemongrass, wheat, and floral hops. The taste is citric and spicy but fades too quickly for my liking. A yeasty and wheaty background on the finish. The feel is watery and crisp, dry. Overall, I have had worse and at least it’s truer to style than some American brewed Witbiers.
The Brew Kettle Felonious Funk Belgian Wit;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Brew Kettle;Bottle: Lightly hazy medium gold w/ a lasting off white head. Coriander very prominent in the nose, wheat malt, light clove, very light orange citrus. Well balanced with a slightly tart flavor, some orange, wheat malt, and yeast spice flavors. Finish is dry and lightly citrusy. Mouthfeel is a little more than dry, borderline chalky and astringent, and highly carbonated. Not a bad Wit, but it seems a little toned down to Belgian counterparts with less of a smooth mouthfeel

Triumph Chico Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Triumph Brewing Company;I’m really baffled by the high ratings of Triumph’s beers. On tap at New hope.

The info cars says that it’s brewed in a Pac-North style and it shows I think. Feel is good. Drinkability is good. A bit of a hophead type of beer.

Davidson Brothers Wheat Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a yellow color with a fair transparency about it. Moderate carbonation flowing into a quickly dissipating white head. The aroma had some sweet corn, floral and grassy hops. Some light banana. Some light bubblegum. The flavor leaned to the sweet side. Bubblegum comes out a bit more here. Grassy and floral hops produce some bitterness, but that’s super faint. Some sweet banana/bubblegum aftertaste, just a pure sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt fine. Overall, I seemed to have missed the wheat portion in this. Was this supposed to be some odd Americanized version of a krystalweizen? Unsure if I would come back to.

Davidson Brothers Wheat Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;"On tap at the brewpub with a 5oz sample. Sour, grassy barnyard-like aroma with mildly lemon-like notes. Not much banana is detected, unfortunately. Aroma is rather faint. Mostly transparent yellow color with a white head. Contrary to popular belief, this does not seem to be ""unfiltered"". Slightly citric and sour lemony flavors with significant maltiness. Sweet, smooth maltiness and low on carbonation. This is tasty, but not really traditional and the appearance sucks."

I was told ""this is not a czech pilsener"" by someone who apparently has been there many times, and is also crazy. Not so bad. Some of the Saaz poking up. Decent pils, though maybe not a CZECH pils. Czech yo’ self before you Wrech yo’ self"
Triumph Czech Pilsner;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Triumph Brewing Company;Sweet malts come through in the nose with the saaz hops pushing their way up as you take your first sip. Very light body midway through with a little spicy / bitter finish adding to the dryness. One of the first pilseners I have ever appreciated.
Triumph Czech Pilsner;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Triumph Brewing Company;Lasting large white head covers the clear golden hue. Subtle hallertauer nose comes out fully floral, lemony and honeysuckle reminiscent. The underneath maltiness is at its softest, grassy, well attenuated.

Pyramid Amber Weizen;Seattle, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);I couldn’t tell what color it poured exactly, then I red the label. So I guess it’s amber. With a pretty unimpressive head that dissipates with no evidence left behind. So what if its not a masterfully crafted beer, it is tastey. Definitely malty, sweet, with a hint of brown sugar. It comes across as a very drinkable and thin version of a fairly malty red ale.

Lagunitas XS Ale;Petaluma, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);22 oz bomber is what I had on hand to taste this with my brother, while visiting on Labor Day and charring up some cow meat. Aroma was just a bit better than average with an up front malty aroma, but there was some hops in the background. They were faint, but there if you dug a little deep. Appearance for me could have been higher, but we had a TON of floaties in my bottle so that took a minor hit. It was dark amber colored, nice off-white head so not bad. Mouthfeel is what really I found intriguing with this beer because of the creamy nature of a strong ale at 7% (okay, okay...6.9% precisely) but it wasn’t overly harsh in any way. Flavors were slightly sweet, but nicely balanced between hops and malts with a bit more bitterness coming around going down. My overall impressions with this beer is that it IS good and very drinkable.

Perhaps a little old (presumably from last May/June, but not oxidized smelling at all yet), but still enjoyable...just not extra special. Will likely re-rate when a fresher batch arrives.

Spinnakers Honey Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;A mildly fruity nose is lively, sparked by the honey. It’s slightly herbal too. Color is lovely, and although the head pours frothy it dissapates too fast. There is too much carbonation in this light-bodied beer. The aftertaste is nice, even a touch hoppy, but there really isn’t that much flavor here overall.
Spinnakers Honey Pale Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Spinnakers Brewpub;Bright pale copper colour. No head. Aroma has slight melon, honey and a little hint of malty earthiness. Flavour is mild - watery, even - with hints of honey and vague fruitiness (peach?).

Merridale Traditional Cider;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Oak, oak and more oak. The oak is very over powering and while the cider has an ok golden colour any underlying flavours and palate characteristics are overpower by the oak. Not very enjoyable, it was much better during the tasting at Merridale. I’m now wondering just how bad the rest of the cider were during the tasting because this was the pick of the bunch.
Merridale Traditional Cider;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;341 ml bottle. Pours a yellow/gold with no head. Aromas of dried apples. Flavour of watery apple juice. Not much there but not offensive either. A high ABV sessionable cider.

Merridale Scrumpy;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;"Muddy pinkish body and no foam, soft sweet earthy apples and no sign of the high alcohol. Flavour is bitter apple, soft wood notes, no sign of the booze. Medium on the mouth. Not sweet at all but not sure it has a good cider vibe either from the bitterness; probably an acquired taste despite a lot of things going for it."
Merridale Scrumpy;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Tap at Alibi. Deep gold, clear, some bubbles. Caramel apple nose, pie, nice apples, calvados.

Merridale Scrumpy;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;"Bright orange pour with no head or bubbles, although it feels carbonated in the mouth. I’m glad this doesn’t taste like Fanta after pouring it out of a plastic bottle. Aroma is of underripe apple skins mingling with notes of hay, star anise, and cat urine. A friend described the aroma here as ""mousey"". I can see it, but am not particularly sensitive to its negativity as he was. Extremely dry on the palate, seems to be a byproduct of the oak. Tannic to the extreme, providing a mouth-coating sensation unlike anything I’ve tasted. Closest thing I can imagine to eating an apple tree whole. Not sure if I love it or hate it, but I’ll be damned if it’s not a unique experience and unforgettable to boot."

Decent.
Merridale Scrumpy;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;"Plastic bottle from Brewery Creek, Vancouver Golden color; no head persistence. Aroma of apple juice, alcohol, chemicals, light hazelnuts and very light Chinese Market; paint remover too. The mouthfeel is dry, so dry like nothing tasted before, and leading to a very dry and astringent finish; there is some acidity, shades of fruits, but the flavor overall is very difficult to accept, weak flavor and aggressive mechanics. I wasted 6 bucks."

Flavour is moderately sweet, light apple, dry finish has a similar wood like touch. Average bodied palate, low to no carbonation. 6/3/6-7/3/13-14 Sampled at Merridale, Cobble Hill, BC.
Merridale Cyser;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Tasted at 2016 Great Canadian Beer Festival in Victoria, BC. Nice balance of sweet and dry.
Merridale Cyser;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Draft - Green apple and tannins. Clear gold. Sweet apple and a long sweet finish. Honey doesn’t really come through.
Merridale Cyser;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;On tap at St. Augustine’s, pours a crystal clear faded yellow with no head. Nose smells more like a cider than a mead, with lots of caramelized apples. Flavour tastes more like a blend, bringing out dry apples upfront, transitioning to honey. Still finishes dry despite the honey. Very nice blend of the cider and mead. Booze isn’t detectable. Good stuff.
Merridale Cyser;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Sampled at the Great Canadian Beer Festival. O.K., because I thought Mead was mainly honey-based I was disappointed this tasted so much like apple cider.There was some honey around the edges, but sweet green apple dominates (and mildly repulses me). Boozy and dry enough to act as a acceptable precursor to a two-day stretch of beer-drinking.
Merridale Cyser;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Got to love the bottle. Looks like juice for kids. Bright, darker golden pour. Clear and almost still. Aroma is rich of caramel apple with a hint of cider vinegar. Complex nose, even when cold. Drinks like an ice cider, but manages to avoid the boozy/sweet characteristics typical there. There are many forms of apple flavor here from tannins to pith to leaves and sweet flesh. The honey is not flavored as such, but adds a floral note. A bit of carbonation would assist the drinkability here, and the sweetness does limit consumption, but this beverage is one of the more interesting, unique cider-type things I’ve had.
Merridale Cyser;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;(3.41 decilitre bottle from Hillside Liquor) Not sure if I’ve had a cyser before. This tastes like a cross between a dry British cider and a Quebecois ice cider. Good in small amounts, I think it would get cloying if I had the whole bottle.
Merridale Cyser;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Small plastic bottle. Deep golden colour. Aroma is quite spicy, lightly herbal and apple. Flavour is sweet, cnnamon, honey, apple, with a dry medicinal finish.
Merridale Cyser;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Plastic bottle from Brewery Creek Deep blond color, with some lonely bubble. Light apple juice aroma, with light acidity, and no honey. Semi-sweet strong cider, with a lean body, and a kind of sweetness that can be due to the honey more than the apples, but the flavor doesn’t go beyond the apple. Simple.
Merridale Cidre Normandie;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Draught at St. Augustine’s, Vancouver Cloudy yellow color. Funky aroma like true French ciders. Good body strength, good flavors, apple cider, wood, tannins, but the alcohol is too strong and spoils a bit the balance. Interesting and complex, for a local cider. Boozy but good.
Merridale Cidre Normandie;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Draft - Funky barnyard and Apple. Clear pale gold with almost no head. Funky apple skin, tannin and a light bitterness and acidity.
Merridale Cidre Normandie;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;On tap at St. Augustine’s, pours a clear dull yellow with no head. Aroma brings out light champagne yeast, fairly dry apple acidity and a touch of a farmhouse character. Flavour is very complex, with lots of barnyard funk, champagne yeast and minor acidity. Bone dry and hugely funky on the finish. One of the finest Merridale products. Excellent.
Merridale Cidre Normandie;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Sampled at Merridale. Flowery nose. Dark golden. Mellow chewy mouthfeel, not particularly sparkly. Dry sweet dry apple base, light floral notes. Feels substantial.
Merridale Cidre Normandie;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Deep gold colour. Still. Really spicy nose with loads of nutmeg and cinammon and sweet apple. Flat body...not just still but dead and oily with no vibrancy at all. Sweet, no trace of those lovely spices, just bland sweet apple must and a hint of tartness at the back. Jeez, that really fell apart.
Merridale Cidre Normandie;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;(Draught) Deep golden body with a strong acidic nose. The flavour was terribly acidic and dry with a somewhat thin and watery finish. Dry overall. My least favourite.
Merridale Cidre Normandie;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;I had this at the cidery and I have only one complaint... if you are going to try to sell people beer, wine, cider, whatever, wouldn’t you want all of them served in a way that presents them at their very best? All the ciders at the winery were served in thick coloured glass tumblers, so colour and aroma were very hard to assess. Also, most of the ciders were at ~18 degrees C, which is way too warm. Those complaints aside, everything I’ve ever had at home has been wonderful, so here goes. Pale yellow colour, aroma of apples, horseblanket. Very dry flavour with some buttery notes, oaky. Clean finish. Alcohol was also obvious at the high temperature that this was served at.
Merridale Winter Apple;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Bottle sampled at Merridale, pours a clear caramel gold with no head. Aroma is very heavy and boozy, with brandy, wood, booze and caramelized syrupy apples. Flavour is intensely sweet, woody and boozy, but not harsh. Sweet, but not too cloying. Wonderfully made. Excellent.
Merridale Winter Apple;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;fortified apple cider dessert wine (10 on sweetness scale). Advertised flavours of baked apple and brown sugar. Slightly viscous, alcohol rush is excessive and washes away the delightful apple flavours, thus off-balanced.
Merridale Winter Apple;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;"Bottle from Brewery Creek Blond color, pale, possibly hazy. Mild apple aroma, mature, with a touch of acidity; but it’s light. Immediately comparable to Ice Ciders, this one is clearly less sweet and more alcoholic, almost burning; sweet flavor, apples and traces of cooked apples, some citrus sourness. Too boozy."
Merridale Winter Apple;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Pours a lovely rosy gold colour. Aroma is brown sugar, baked sweet apples. Tastes very, very sweet indeed, more baked apple with plenty of warm alcohol & vanilla near the end. Coats the throat, nice body. Very fond of this one - the first bottle we bought was lost in an unfortunate accident, but I’m glad we had a chance to try it again!
Merridale Winter Apple;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;375 ml bottle shared with Capflu, Goldorak, beerbuzzmontreal, and DumDum at the Ciderwinder tasting in Ottawa. Still caramel-brandy appearance, quite viscous and oily...alcohol-infused oak and pepper along with sharp apples...gorgeous honeyish palate, sweet and thick, alcohol less present than expected...burns just a touch at the front, but warms late with beautiful honey-almond-vanilla pools amidst the ocean of apple. Wonderful.
Merridale Winter Apple;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Pours a copper color. Aroma of apples with lingering sweetness and alcohol. Very sweet flavor of apples and alcohol with a bitter finish.
Merridale Winter Apple;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Caramel, almost scotch-like in color and was syrupy. Alcoholic nose (not surprising at a booming 19%ABV), but behind that boozy blast up the nostrils is a flowery, fruity aroma that reminded me of Mirabelle, an eau-de-vie made in the Lorraine region of France with little fruits that look like yellow prunes. Again, with the first sip comes a surge of alcohol that attacks you on the start, but it’s not strong enough to give you shivers. Then a slow creshendo of honey sweetness finishes it off nicely. Makes a great digestif. Thanks CapFlu for sharing.
Merridale Winter Apple;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;(Bottle) I very much enjoyed this cider - enough so that I brought a bottle East with me to share. I hope others enjoy it as much. Pours a clear, deep golden. Fermented 4 times to bring the alcohol level up to bordering on 20%. Thin white head with a whiskey, brown sugar nose. The flavour was euphoric - very sweet American Apple Pie with an alcohol and sour undertone. Excellent.
Merridale Winter Apple;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Gorgeous bright orange colour and completely still. Sweet, earthy aroma with an unmistakable Brettanomyces character. Baked apple character and some light spice as well. Flavour is intensely sweet, apple, spice, and an earthy and musty flavour. Faint citrus character on the finish. Good, but not as complex as the giant alcohol content would have you expect.
Merridale Champagne Style Somerset;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Tasting at Matt’s So pale that is near to water. Vinous aroma, delicate, a bit flowery, light fruity touch, but also a hint of cork. Dry, acidic, and empty, no remarkable flavor, and a bit astringent in the final. One more American poor cider that doesn’t go anywhere.
Merridale Champagne Style Somerset;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Bottle - Some green apple and sulphur. Very clear. Apple peel, blight bitterness and a dry finish. No bubbles at all, not worth the hype.
Merridale Champagne Style Somerset;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;"Pours a very light colour, almost clear. Aroma of red apple skins, and a touch of baking spice. Bit of ripe cheese. Taste is slightly tart, fairly dry, but thin and uncomplex. Almost no bubbles, which isn’t right for a champagne, ""effervescent"" cider."
Merridale Champagne Style Somerset;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;750mL bottle, pours a clear pale blonde with a small white head. Aroma is bone dry, with champagne-like effervescence and super dry apples. Flavour is very restrained, with bone dry apples and maybe a touch of champagne wildness. Don’t get any of the high alcohol. Not very complex at all. The carbonation is surprisingly underwhelming -- barely carbonated. Not bad, but very underwhelming. Disappointing.
Merridale Champagne Style Somerset;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Vintage 2006, red label. Cloudy white yellow, very sparkly. Champagne dry, light floral apple and citrus. Very nice subtle dry flavors, definitely comparable with a good champagne. Super nice.
Merridale Champagne Style Somerset;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Bottle, shared with friends at the lake. Dark yellow gold, a little dirty-hazy looking. This smelled and tasted the same as the other Merridale ciders I’ve had-- an odd chemical edge to a simple apple-mash flavour, medicinal bitter finish. I’m guessing freshness is critical for this little cidery, because I haven’t really enjoyed their products to the same degree as those who have tried them while visiting the cidery. Either that, or I don’t have a palate for ciders I guess. I actually didn’t care for this at all.
Merridale Champagne Style Somerset;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Liked this one a lot when i tried it at the Great Canadian Beer Festival. Found it to be far more full-bodied and interesting than the House Cider from Merridale. Would love to try this from the bottle or tap!
Merridale Champagne Style Somerset;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;(Druaght) Sampled at the cidery. Pours a dry apple nose with a brown sugar hint. Flavour is finely crafted with local tart apples and a refined sugary finish. Being a supporter of champagne-style ciders, I knew I’d like this one. Very good.
Merridale Champagne Style Somerset;Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Merridale Estate Cidery;Hazy beige-yellow colour. Aroma is of apple skins, hint of brown sugar and sulphite. Soft and bubbly, with a rounded apple flavour, sweet edge and only a hint of alcohol coming in late, this is probably the most accessible but also the best-crafted Merridale’s product yet.
York Final Whistle;York, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Cask, half-pint at Royal Oak, watching the world cup match between England and Columbia.

York Final Whistle;York, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Cask @ Mr Foley’s, Leeds.

Walshs Bakehouse Flying Top;Warwick, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Walshs Bakehouse;[Cask at GBBF 2004] A nut- brown beer with no head. The aroma is sweet hoppy. The flavor is sweet with notes of roasted bread, fruit, and flowers leading to a dry end.
Walshs Bakehouse Flying Top;Warwick, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Walshs Bakehouse;Cask, GBBF 2004. Amber, no head and almost no condition. Trace hop and malt aromas, gentle malt and hop in the mouth with some sweet toffee notes developing with time. Low caramel in the finish.
Walshs Bakehouse Flying Top;Warwick, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Walshs Bakehouse;This beer tasted a bit tired to me. Or perhaps it was just my palate that was tired due to drinking too many similar beers. Amber colour. Bready aroma. Someone said it also smelt of wet dog, and I know what they meant. Drinkable, but unexceptional. Maybe not in peak condition. Cask, GBBF 2004.
Walshs Bakehouse Flying Top;Warwick, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Walshs Bakehouse;Cask@GBBF04. Quite thin and short i thought, some hints of apple and caramel in the flavour. Felt a bit grainy and thin in the end though, not very interesting.
Walshs Bakehouse Flying Top;Warwick, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Walshs Bakehouse;Gravity at the Great British Beer Festival, Kensington Olympia, London. (Thursday Session). Yet another one of the many British bitters that couldn’t stand up to foreign competition at the GBBF. Nothing stand out about this deeply average ale.
Walshs Bakehouse Flying Top;Warwick, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Walshs Bakehouse;GBBF, London. Brown/orange pint, no head. Slight hop aroma. Sweet marmalade flavour, some orange, but no bite. Warm, chubby mouthfeel, with a lingering, sugary finish. Not to my tastes.
Walshs Bakehouse Flying Top;Warwick, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Walshs Bakehouse;GBBF. Amber colour. A dry, almost wheaty (not fermented) best bitter. Some dustiness. Drinkable.
Walshs Bakehouse Flying Top;Warwick, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Walshs Bakehouse;Cask Conditioned at The Tilted Wig, Warwick. Amber orange beer with tight head. A very tasty best bitter with a deep hoppy flavour and a mid roasted slightly nutty malt. Orange and tangerine notes, a very decent effort rom a new micro.
Dragonmead Honey Porter;Warren, Michigan, United States;Porter;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at BST. Dark brown, almost black pour with a thin white head. Dark chocolate with a honey sweetness in the taste and aroma. A nice, drinkable porter.
Dragonmead Honey Porter;Warren, Michigan, United States;Porter;Dragonmead Brewery;Aroma of coffee, dark chocolate, tobacco, pear. Appears dark brown, nearly black, and opaque with a big frothy caramel head and some lace. Tastes sweet upfront of pear and some honey followed by a balancing coffee and dark chocolate bitterness. Palate is a bit fuller than ordinary. Overall, good.
Dragonmead Honey Porter;Warren, Michigan, United States;Porter;Dragonmead Brewery;"Tap: deep brown near the edges, nearly black in the center with a chunky, khaki collar that has good staying power. Aroma has notes of bitter chocolates & cocoa dust, residual ""honey"" sweetness, some caramel, light brown sugar, perhaps inducing a reminder of graham cracker. Taste is pretty sweet, but controlled. Dark chocolate, roasted malt, light caramel, honey finish. A touch of ashy hops with some faint brown sugar notes. A pretty nice & easy drinking porter."
Dragonmead Honey Porter;Warren, Michigan, United States;Porter;Dragonmead Brewery;On nitro at brewery. Beautiful. Dark brown with long-lasting tan head. Faint nose of honey. Great creamy mouthfeel. Charred malt and honey. Beautifully balanced.

The finish is sweet and roasty with a short malt aftertaste. Slightly above average overall.
Dragonmead Honey Porter;Warren, Michigan, United States;Porter;Dragonmead Brewery;Draft. A nice porter with a little extra sweetness from the honey. Smooth, chocolate presence is there. I had just a sample but will try more on another visit.
Dragonmead Honey Porter;Warren, Michigan, United States;Porter;Dragonmead Brewery;nitro... can’t believe there is so much honey in this, I get a bit of the chocolate but this is so dull, the base must be terrible

Aroma of chalky malt (it did not have a strong aroma). Flavor of bitter chocolate, light honey sweetness, and sweet roasted malt. A decent porter that is on the sweet side. 6/4/6/3/11 [3.0/5]
Hoppers Apple Raspberry Lambic;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;"I would say it’s a fruit beer; Hell, it’s brewed in Florida… nothing more to say! I was rather impressed with this “fruit beer,” actually it could be a “Flemish Sour,” anyway, it was delicious! The raspberries were most abundant in the aroma and flavor… the apple was only a side note… a suggestion of crisp dry cider. Very tart with notes of strawberry rhubarb pie… I was more than shocked to find that it packs an 11% abv, in addition… it’s delicious! Hoppers is really doing a tremendous job with there brewing!"
Archers Wallingtons Celebration Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Handpump at the Smithfield Hotel, Manchester 21/05/2004 Amber golden coloured fruity beer with bubble gum aromas and some dryness in the crisp malt finish.

Thwaites Dark Smooth (Nitro keg);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;On tap at The White Lion, Four Oaks. Pours Dark Red, single finger white head. Aroma, creamy, roast malts, dark fruits. Taste is much the same, nice and smooth, could do with fuller flavour though nice!
Thwaites Dark Smooth (Nitro keg);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;A style of beer which doesn’t seem to be popular these days. Dark in colour with a smooth and slightly creamy tan head which doesn’t last. Very easy drinking, nothing amazing but has a slightly nutty taste, I’m actually rather taken with this, it certainly has its place and I reckon it’s pretty decent. More please!
Thwaites Dark Smooth (Nitro keg);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;Pint in Kettering Park hotel. Pours dark nut red. Tea, light toast nose. Flavour is watery sweet with nut, wood, metallic finish. No carbonation. Meh
Thwaites Dark Smooth (Nitro keg);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;Dark but not completely black as it may first appear. What it lacks in flavour it gains in its very smooth palatable texture. Has a very mild sweetness in its aroma.
Thwaites Dark Smooth (Nitro keg);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;Really watery palate, that ’smooth’ mouthful of pasteurised bitter, almost no discernible hops or malt.
Thwaites Dark Smooth (Nitro keg);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;Keg Handpump at the Royal Oak, Ramsbottom 06/07/2003 Dark red colour and slightly fruity. Smooth on the palate with a slight roast finish.

Thwaites Dark Smooth (Nitro keg);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Mild Ale;Thwaites Brewery;Keg, The Shovels, Blackpool. Worse beer of the Blackpool Rocks weekend. Dreadful.

Saint Arnold Summer Pils;Houston, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery. Clear golden with a small white head. Aroma is honey and grain. Flavor is sweet, honey, grain, touch of hop. More like a helles really. Decently clean and crisp. OK.
Saint Arnold Summer Pils;Houston, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a clear yellow color with a white head and good retention. Spotty lacing. Typical pilsner profile taste. Sharp crisp flavors with a lightly bitter finish. Decent.
Saint Arnold Summer Pils;Houston, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Saint Arnold brews some excellent Lagers. While they undoubtedly have some better bottom-fermenting brews in their lineup, I think this one is underrated. It's simple, yes, but there's no off flavors whatsoever. Pour is pale yellow. Flavor starts off pleasantly grainy and finishes with grassy, lemony Noble hops. It's crisp, clean, and chug-able. It works best when the beer is ice cold and when you're hot and sweaty.
Saint Arnold Summer Pils;Houston, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;This is a great pils - what it claims to be, a great summer time light drinking beer. Not the best beer or the most dynamic, but what Pilsner is? I really like this simple, good tasting beer damn it ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Saint Arnold Summer Pils;Houston, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Sampled from a bottle purchased in a sixer by the prodigal son while in Houston, natch. No glass so I rate in the bottle while drinking it very cold. A thin nose, a little grass and grain coming through. On for a taste, pretty decent. Lemon, barley, slightly hoppy and bitter. Great summer drink, ripe for a session. It is what it is.
Saint Arnold Summer Pils;Houston, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Can from 504 Craft Beer Reserve, New Orleans.

Saint Arnold Summer Pils;Houston, Texas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;I am not a fan of this brewery. This one is too sweet and not refreshing enough for the style. The hop quality seemed poor. A sweet bland beer that is forgetable
Thwaites Liberation Ale (Bottle);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thwaites Brewery;Bottle. Amber. Very malty. Roasted malts. Toffee. Fruity (dried fruits, oranges), spices. Some grassy hops. Sweet malty fruity. Dryish, bittersweet finish. OK, drinkable. (2008)
Thwaites Liberation Ale (Bottle);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thwaites Brewery;From BA (11/11/2007): 500ml dark brown bottle, brewed to celebrate ’Rememberance Day’. Poured in a straight Bateman’s pint glass. Dark mahogany in colour, very clear and clean looking, good biege head. Looks good. The aroma was fairly weak, some hops and malts, but nothing to set your senses alight. The taste is a very dry hoppy affair, very dry compared to most English bitters. The 5.2% is in the mouthfeel, the dryness is also very prominent in the aftertaste. The beer is OK, but not great.
Thwaites Liberation Ale (Bottle);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thwaites Brewery;50cl bottle. Decent white head. Clear amber pour. Subtle bitterness in the aftertaste

Thwaites Liberation Ale (Bottle);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thwaites Brewery;Reminds me of London Pride this one. Nose is mild malt and dry fruit. The pour is a ruby brown colour. Head is a good two fingers with some decent lacing. Taste reminds me of London Pride. Dark fruit , biscuit ,caramel and a slightly bitter malty edge.
Thwaites Liberation Ale (Bottle);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thwaites Brewery;Bottle. Chesnut coloured, thin white head. Aroma of dried fruit and a touch of chocolate in the background. A decent biscuity malt flavour with some raisins and a surprisingly bitter finish. I don’t think the beer is very balanced and I don’t like it very much.

Thwaites Bitter / Smooth Beer (Keg);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thwaites Brewery;From an old notebook, catching up on inputting the beers of my youth. Thwaites Smooth was one of those horrible creamflow cold wet vaguely beery ‘bitters’ that populated British pubs in the mid/late 90s and had very little going for it. Having grown up in Preston/Blackburn...it was quite different from the Bitter of the
Thwaites Bitter / Smooth Beer (Keg);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thwaites Brewery;"Nitro Keg Pint in North Yorkshire in Sept 2016 - Amber in colour.

Draught House Reanimator Doppelbock;Austin, Texas, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Draught House Pub & Brewery;A pretty good attempt on the style, but I expected a bit more punch. Standard nuttiness and malt in the aroma, but it was toned down too much. Taste followed suit, just not enough malty backbone to it, I sensed that it was all there, but amp it up guys.
Draught House Reanimator Doppelbock;Austin, Texas, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Man I love Austin. Great Brew Pubs. This beer is awesome for spring. Huge and alcoholic. Malty and salty, sweet and bold this beer will kncok your dong off. Looks like a Salvator. Bronze and thick looking. No head...would like a head but I will do without. Smells like a great Doppel...that means apricot, thick molasses and soy sauce. Tastes awesome. Very thick. Carbonation takes over and comlpliments the giant maltiness of the brew. Hops...I can’t even taste them. Aftertaste is excellent. Check it out G-rat

A bit thin.

Rogue Yellow Snow IPA;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA;Rogue Ales;Robe orange trouble, mousse éphémère dont subsiste quelques plaques en surface. Le nez est assez malté, mais le houblon est présent (mandarine). En bouche, l'attaque est partagée entre une franche amertume et des arômes fleuris, avec du corps qui se sent, même si l'amertume prend le pas au bout de quelques secondes. Amertume puissante, mais un certain équilibre, qui s'estompe peu à peu alors que le houblon est étonnamment long en bouche. Très sympa, bien que l'amertume tende à être un peu trop forte pour moi. Arômes très intéressants.

Fin sødme overfor det bitre og en smag med flere nuancer end førnævnte bryg. Middel bitter med bedre og tydeligere humleprofil tilføjet en mindre sødme. Forholdsvis blød mundfølelse, men stadig frisk og let perlende. Karboneret på et middel niveau eller lige under sammenholdt med en olieret konsistens. Middel fyldig krop og en bitter afslutning. Overall: Dette er en Pilsener, man altid gerne vil smage og kan glæde sig til. Hæver sig over niveauet af hel- og halvdårlige forsøg. Godkendt. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Rustic dark brown coloured body, clear and well conditioned. Frothy tanned head. Woody, oaked flavour, mild roasted notes.

Watch City 38 Schilling Scottish Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;~8oz glass @ brewpub. Billed as an Amber and Scottish mix. Color is dark pale, a lot of clarity. Aroma is basic pale ale mixed with a cornish-biscuit. Taste is similarly BMC-ish and corny pale ale. Nothing distinctive, barely a thirst quencher and not recommended. Also not a Scottish ale but more like Pale or maybe Bitter.

Watch City 38 Schilling Scottish Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;Draught pint at the brewery on 4/21/06 Small, but sticky off-white head sits atop a golden-copper body with light strawberry blond tints. Quite clear and lightly bubbly with minor, blotchy lacing, and a mostly well-retained head. Nose is highly fruity, lovely Edinburgh yeast allowed to ferment at will, throwing out light minerals, earth, apples, cherries, raspberries, strawberries and such. Papery, hay-like hops work their way in and keep things dry, but light pale malts provide just enough sweetness via light sugars. Quite aromatic and decidedly snappy from the hops and esters. A crisp, strong yeastiness and mineral-like note linger on the end for a long while. Golden delicious apples, fresh white dough and light cherries all combine to create a fresh, flavorful body, with flowery and light hay-like hops that keep things dry, while a strong attenuation and moderate carbonation make it very drinkable. Yellow fruits gain juiciness (pears, nectarines) and are quite prevalent on the end, coupled with the drying yeast and hops. Medium-light body, no alcohol.
Watch City 38 Schilling Scottish Ale;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;Found a couple old notes from a visit to Watch City.

The aroma is sweet malty with light notes of caramel and straw. The flavor is sweet with light notes of caramel and metal - the metal notes carries all the way thru to the dry end. And the body is thin. I wonder if the metal note is due to the used hops.
Spendrups Röd Lager 3.5%;Grängesberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spendrups Bryggeri;Canned. Dark rusty ruby red colour, huge beige head, some lace. Aroma is caramellish malts with slight roasted hints. Flavour is caramellish malts and hops in the finish. Sadly the metallicness ruins it a lot. Otherwise quite pleasant.
Spendrups Röd Lager 3.5%;Grängesberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spendrups Bryggeri;Can (BB 10/2006). Very dark ruby color, big foamy brownish head. Very emtallic aroma, slightly nutty and grassy. Nutty, malty, watery, dry and slightly metallic. Stronger version was quite tasty, this is (too) much closer to water.
Spendrups Röd Lager 3.5%;Grängesberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spendrups Bryggeri;Out of the can and out of my memory. (Meaning I have not notes on this one). I was not very excited about this one. I see that it has got some good reviews but honestly I wasn’t that impressed. For one thing, this watery muck, tasted a lot like metal. Which I don’t rather fancy. Apart from that I like the idea of the caramell malt lager and yes, there are traces of caramell in the taste (even more so I should guess in the stronger version). Otherwise, not very hoppy nor very malty. Just thin. But kind of pretty to look at with it’s amber red color and it’s white lasting foam.
Wolpertinger Chiemseer Maibock;Traunstein, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Maximilians Brauerei;Malty biscuit aroma. Sweet, malty flavor with some peach and cookies. A hint of butter and a hint of bitterness in the afteratste. Not the best maibock, but good enough.
Mishawaka Transit of Venus Sunrise Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Sad news as apparently Mishawaka BrewCo has closed down effective April 2011. This small batch, limited release was my favorite beer that I had there. This has been years ago, but from what I remember it poured a vibrant orange with a nice fluffy head. Plenty bitter, but with a reserved sweetness. Used to hang out with friends there after class and drink $4 pitchers (hella cheap!) on Tuesdays. Good times, but the brewery had a lot of problems the last couple years what with the terrible economy in our area. That and the fact that the overall quality of their brews (especially in bottles) was below substandard compared to nearby legends like Bell’s, 3 Floyds, and Founders. However it also introduced a lot of people (including myself) to the world of craft beers, and for that I give heartfelt praise.
Mishawaka Transit of Venus Sunrise Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;This one packs a nice punch! Good flavour, big alcohol content, it doesn’t really feel like their other IPA, it does have some very nice body. Very nicely hopped.
Mishawaka Transit of Venus Sunrise Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Draft sampler at MBC. Dark amber color with a moderate white head that diminished slowly. Moderate hoppy aroma. Medium body with dry texture. Light hoppy flavor with a small bitter finish.
Mishawaka Transit of Venus Sunrise Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;All Centennial hops makes for a nice hop aroma. Copper orange. Medium head with some lacing. Kind of grainy and grassy. Ample bitterness. Medium body. Basicly a Two Hearted knock-off.
Mishawaka Transit of Venus Sunrise Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Orange/amber pour with a light off-white head. Centennial hops provided most of the aroma, with a little caramelly sweetness behind it. Flavor followed the aroma very well, but the single hop variety kept this from being more complex and interesting. Finish carried through the caramel and piney hops, and was a bit sticky.
Mishawaka Transit of Venus Sunrise Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Nice deep gold color with Mishawaka’s creamiest off-white head. Aroma is haystacks, neglected grass fields, cedar and caramel. Much creamier than their other renditions. Smooth, and a reserved hop profile. How many IPAs neglect the hops and favor the malts? Other elements include basement paneling, moth balls and spring cleaning. Decent, but an IPA? I’m not so sure.
Mishawaka Transit of Venus Sunrise Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Draft. Another pale ale. Could tell it was all one hop, somehow. Orangey hop taste matches its orangey color, Sweet light caramel malts. Toward the end, a big pineyness comes along, too.
Mishawaka Transit of Venus Sunrise Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Pours a dark orange color, with a small white head. Aroma is piney and citrus hops. Flavor is piney hops, apples, and bitter. Palate is nicely appeased. Thanks to BBB63 For this tasty brew!
Mishawaka Transit of Venus Sunrise Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;On tap at Mad Anthony’s Octobeer Fest. Pretty golden color with a fluffy white head and an orange citrus nose. Grainy astringency with a rotten orange rind funkiness in the finish. Both of Mishiwaka’s beer that I tried reminded me of homebrew.
Mishawaka Transit of Venus Sunrise Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Tap. Orange-amber color. Floral and citric hop aroma. Bitter sour taste that lingers. Not that great.
Breughel St-Pacôme de Kamouraska;Saint-Germain-de-Kamouraska, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Breughel;Bouteille de 500 ml achetée au Marché du Boisé à Trois-Rivières. Bière blonde dorée voilée. Dégustée le 15 mai 2005 (tulip). Mousse peu, col mince, assez durable. Peu effervescente, bulles moyennes. Odeur de framboise marquée et un peu d’épices en finale. Très douce, un peu sucrée, peu amère. Goût de framboise bien présent mais pas trop marqué. Manque un peu de caractère. Un peu trop douce, manque de pétillant.
Breughel St-Pacôme de Kamouraska;Saint-Germain-de-Kamouraska, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Breughel;Hazy pinkish salmon colour, white head. Aroma of toilet refreshener, citrus, lactic sour and wheat. Sour flavour, light raspberry, pomegranate, lactic acid, quite astringent. Light fruity finish, pomegranate astringent. Better than expected actually. (From 50cL bottle shared @ RBBWG III, Gent. From trade with mathieuc, thanks!)
Breughel St-Pacôme de Kamouraska;Saint-Germain-de-Kamouraska, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Breughel;18/I/14 - 50cl bottle @ RBBWG III, my place - BB: n/a (2014-68) Thanks to Tinus for sharing the bottle! Cloudy grapefruit pink beer, small irregular off-white head, unstable, dissipates immediately, non adhesive. Aroma: boys urinals at a children’s summer camping site. No really. Also some almonds and a bit sugary. MF: ok carbon, medium to light body. Taste: it does surprisingly enough taste like raspberries. Bit sourish, yoghurt, lemony, more raspberries. Aftertaste: raspberry, yeasty, lemon juice, actually this is not too bad. Just the smell that’s horrible.
Breughel St-Pacôme de Kamouraska;Saint-Germain-de-Kamouraska, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Breughel;@RBBWG 2014. Pink/orange colour. Sour taste, fruity. Medium carbonation. Some light sweetness. Thin body and watery but refreshing and easy drinkable. Not that bad.
Breughel St-Pacôme de Kamouraska;Saint-Germain-de-Kamouraska, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Breughel;50cl bouteille @ RBBWG III, thanks Tinus. Rosée avec cette couleur melon, pas de col et ni de mousse. Arôme est faiblard avec un léger fruité - framboise tirant sur des effluves surettes. Palais est fruité avec encore une fois des framboises, note de blé léger qui perdent un peu de leur profil terreux. Très peu au niveau des épices malgré que cela soit indiqué sur l’étiquette. On note un peu le profil blanche belge, mais ce dernier peine vraiment à se faire ressentir.
Breughel St-Pacôme de Kamouraska;Saint-Germain-de-Kamouraska, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Breughel;Tinus...thanks?! Sampled @ RBBWG 2014. Pours a cloudy pinkish, yellow color with a ring of head. The smell is sour strawberry, mint. The taste is a watery strawberry, tart, popcicle with a dry after taste. Light, watery body with light carbonation.
Breughel St-Pacôme de Kamouraska;Saint-Germain-de-Kamouraska, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Breughel;50 cl. bottle sampled @ RBBWG 2014. Courtesy of & thx! to Martinus. The stories behind this brewery are awesomely messed-up (feel free to check out the forum archive for specific), this stuff is bound a legendary legacy. Pours a raspberry / pomegranate, murky, looks more like a really bad soda than a beer, no head. Nose is all lactic & lemon sour, soapy, artificial cleaning agent notes, soda, this smells unintentionally wild fermented. Taste is sour, all kinds of seemingly unintentionally sour critters, lactic sour like bad yoghurt, tangy, the words urinal cakes were thrown around a lot by the group, watery, bad soda, some unidentifiable fruits, pomegranate touch. Musty fermenting strawberries. Faintly fizzing out body & very watery overall. Bad but nowhere near as extremely horrible as we were hoping for honestly.
Breughel St-Pacôme de Kamouraska;Saint-Germain-de-Kamouraska, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Breughel;Bottle at RBWG14 Pours peach coloured . No real foam Smells infected , strawberry , High carbo . Taste is strawberry , not really infected in the taste . Bit dry sugar

Nez fruitées aux notes acides (framboises) avec des traces de yogourt, de céréales et de levures. Mince en bouche avec un pétillement moyen ainsi qu’avec une texture minérale. Goût fruité sucré et légèrement acide et sûr (framboises) avec des traces de levures dès l’entrée en bouche suivi d’un léger goût minéral avec des notes de grains de céréales puis en finale l’on retrouve des traces métalliques et herbeuses. Post-goût court, composé d’un léger goût fruité (framboise chimique) avec des notes herbeuses. (2006)
Breughel St-Pacôme de Kamouraska;Saint-Germain-de-Kamouraska, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Breughel;on tap at brewpub. hazy light pinkish with a nice white head, some retention, no lacing. fresh raspberries, decent cereals, some wheat, hint of acidity, touch of yeast mustiness. average carbonation, some fizz, light body - quenching. decent lightly acidic and herbal finish. not a fan of the style - still is the best one i’ve had out seven of their brews - all drank at brewpub.
Holdens Walsall Wallop;Dudley, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Holdens Brewery;Cask, at Newark Beer Festival, May 2004. Notes recovered from a recently unearthed old notebook. Pale amber in colour. Subtle mix of fruity malt and earthy hop in the aroma. So far, so normal. However, I found the flavour distinctly odd. Plenty of tangy hop and quite a ration of bitterness but it is also distinctly sweet, making for a rather odd mouthfeel. Restrained caramel and berry fruit in the background. Quite interesting but not entirely to my taste - seemed a bit unbalanced with the elements not perfectly matched or integrated.
Holdens Walsall Wallop;Dudley, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Holdens Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Community Centre, Frodsham 07/05/2004 Golden coloured slightly rich on the palate and hoppy. Malty bitter finish.
Holdens Walsall Wallop;Dudley, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Holdens Brewery;Amber with some pink in appearance! Aromas are caramel and spicy hops. Flavours are smooth caramel - quite sweet and malty. Quite thick in consistency and has a decent hop finish. A sweetish OK beer.
Newby Wyke Bardia;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask. Can’t smell, as usual my nose is completely fucked. Amber with a white head. Dry and hoppy with a liitle flowery hint, some light spice. Fairly standard stuff but I did enjoy this. Nothing exciting about the style for me but this was nice enough.
Newby Wyke Bardia;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;A pale golden orange coloured beer with a thickish white head. A light hoppy aroma, slightly floral, and grassy. The taste is dry with a medium bitterness. Floral hops dominate, then a biscuity malt flavour comes through in the end. (Cask - The Fox & Hounds, Heacham, Norfolk).
Newby Wyke Bardia;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Plain bitter appearance with an airy aroma and a basic watery bitter flavour. Overall a very plain English bitter.
Newby Wyke Bardia;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Still and golden. Aromas are pleasant light pine. Flavours mainly consist of dry, bitter hops with some floral notes. Smooth on the palate and quite decent.
The Cowboy California Common;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Clear amber body with beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, floral. Taste is moderately sweet, floral, light caramel. Medium body.
The Cowboy California Common;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;The beer pours a limpid golden color, the head is tall and creamy, the color white, with a nice sheet of lace to cover the glass. Nose is sweet malt, with a crisp freshness and the start sweet and nicely malted, top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has a stern acidity, the hops powerful in their spicy bite, quite dry and a real nice drinking beer.
Cascade Lakes Blonde Bombshell;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;355ml can. (4.3% ABV) Pours a clear pale gold with a medium, foamy, long lasting, white head that laces. Mild aroma of bready wheat malt, lemon and grassy hops. Sweet flavour of grainy wheat malt and lemon in a crisp, dry, mild bitter grass finish. Light body with a thin, watery texture and average carbonation. Refreshing, easy to drink and boring. A good thirst quencher on a hot summer day.
Cascade Lakes Blonde Bombshell;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;On tap at Snakepit yesterday. Clear golden pour with a white head. Not much aroma to speak of, but it’s slightly sweet and grainy. Really basic for a frequently boring style, but it’s drinkable.
Cascade Lakes Blonde Bombshell;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;Not to bad, but not overwhelming. Slight wheaty and malty taste, but mostly resembles a Lager. Definitely drinkable, but not wonderful. (K)
Cascade Lakes Blonde Bombshell;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;This is an old NW standby. I’ve had it a bunch of times mostly in the summer or at The Creek.
Cascade Lakes Blonde Bombshell;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;This was the first beer for Cannery Row Beer Club night. We had mixed feedback on this slightly slinky tastin/smelling beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Cascade Lakes Blonde Bombshell;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;Pleasant and refreshing. It’s pretty much everything you will want from a Golden/Blonde.
Cascade Lakes Blonde Bombshell;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;Tap, gold pour, white head, nose is lacking, taste is lacking, bud light, really light
Cascade Lakes Blonde Bombshell;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;Bottle from Smoker Friendly. Light golden in color. Grainy nose with a bit of a sour twang to it. Grainy with a little bit of a malty base. A little bit of a grassy hop flavor to it. Easy drinking. Fairly boring, but seems clean. Tastes a bit like a pilsner.
Cascade Lakes Blonde Bombshell;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;"""aroma fresh, of grain and a little grassy. look is typical. feel is crisp and clean. flavor is sweet grain and faint grass with a touch of hops at the end. nothin worth seeking out, especially in OR."""
Cascade Lakes Blonde Bombshell;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;This fairly bland, but highly drinkable. Lightweight grainy nose, with some taste of a wheat ale, lightly hopped.. Pale golden body with a scant head. Mild hoppy, dry finish. Would be good on a very, very hot day.
Parish Farm Gold;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Parish Brewing Co.;14/3/2019. Cask at the Leicester Beer Festival 2019. Pours amber brown with a small off-white head. Aroma of grain, citrus, hops and light caramel. Medium sweetness, moderate bitterness. Moderate body, slight oily texture, soft carbonation.
Parish Farm Gold;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Parish Brewing Co.;Cask at The Anderson, Fortrose. Nothing special. A fairly thin taste and an average body.
Parish Farm Gold;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Parish Brewing Co.;Cask@Melton Mowbray Beer Festival 2007. Brown beer with a lightly fruity and dry flavour. Overall a nice fruity and dry beer.
Parish Farm Gold;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Parish Brewing Co.;Nice enough and twice as tasty as they say. Cask Conditioned in the ol’ local in Norwich. We get a fair bit of beer coming up our way. Like a splash of lemon water on the tongue.
Parish Farm Gold;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Parish Brewing Co.;Cask Conditioned at Harbury Beer Festival ’04. Dark amber coloured with light head. Bright spritzy beer with light summer flavours. A sweet graininess pervades the beer and a long bitter finish. Quite enjoyable.
Parish Farm Gold;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Parish Brewing Co.;Copper with a persistant foamy head. Aromas are sweet grain and sulphur. Flavours are sweet grain with citrus notes. Quite chalky dryness - not bad.
Brown Cow Bière de Citron;Selby, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brown Cow Brewery;Cask conditioned, White Horse, Hedgerley, Bucks. Gravity dispense, poured by me. A lively golden ale with a foamy head. It’s malty (bread/biscuit), balanced by medium-sharp lemon. I believe this beer is brewed with lemon, instead of just sharp/citric hops, but not enough lemon to justify it being called a fruit beer, it is simply a golden ale with a hint of lemon.
Deschutes Horse Ridge IPA;Bend, Oregon, United States;IPA;Deschutes Brewery;Draught at the Deschutes Brewery, Bend, OR. Cloudy amber colour with a small off-white head. Piney and fruity hops, mild bitterness and some malty sweetness in the aroma. Sweet soapy fruity hops and mild bitterness in the flavour. Balanced and easy.
Deschutes Horse Ridge IPA;Bend, Oregon, United States;IPA;Deschutes Brewery;"less inspired than hophenge, or even hop trip. the casking mellows things a bit too much for me, especially in an ipa...makes it more complex, but not aromatic enough. not bad though."""
Deschutes Horse Ridge IPA;Bend, Oregon, United States;IPA;Deschutes Brewery;Rating backlog, from Sept 2011. Poured an amber color with a whitish head. Aroma was solid, with citrus, nuts and caramel. Flavor was about the same in quality and components.
Deschutes Horse Ridge IPA;Bend, Oregon, United States;IPA;Deschutes Brewery;Draught at the Deschutes Brewery & Public House in Bend, OR. Fruity, sugary, mildly hoppy nose, along with a slightly sour tang.. Medium copper color. Caramel and raisins in initial / absolutely wonderful balance in mid palate / more caramel and hop cream pie in finish. Very good stuff. This is in Deschutes’ best style line -- kind of an amped-up big brother to Inversion. Also had it on cask, and that version had a mild blue cheese initial flavor but overall was a bit milder and gentler and not quite as full bodied as the regular.
Deschutes Horse Ridge IPA;Bend, Oregon, United States;IPA;Deschutes Brewery;Several 6 oz drafts at the Hats off to Homebrewers event held at Amigoni Winery in Kansas City, Missouri. The pour is a mostly clear orange copper brown, with a nicely formed off white head. The aroma is nicely balanced between toasty nutty malt and a resin, citrus fruit hop character. The taste follows the nose, and may even lean a bit more towards the malt character. The toast of the malt plays really nicely with the resinous hops. The palate is medium bodied, touch lower carbonation, resin leads to a bitter dry finish. Nice beer, really glad they brought this out with them. Cheers to Deshutes and Boulevard for a great event.
Deschutes Horse Ridge IPA;Bend, Oregon, United States;IPA;Deschutes Brewery;really nice. I liked it alot. Great nose, malty, burlappy with bright aroma of nw hops. Great balance great stuff
Deschutes Horse Ridge IPA;Bend, Oregon, United States;IPA;Deschutes Brewery;Tap @ Deschutes Bend... Poured clear, amber with a lacey white head. Mild soapy aroma. Good hop flavor, not too bitter. Caramel malt sweetness. Earthy, citrus hops. Short finish.
Deschutes Horse Ridge IPA;Bend, Oregon, United States;IPA;Deschutes Brewery;On draught at the Bend brew pub. Pours clear orange. One sip yields delicious citrus, grapefruit, and resin, with the traditional Deschutes malt backbone of tea leaves. Yum. Long bitter finish. Crisp and easy to drink for a brew with this many IBUs. My favorite of all the IPAs I tasted on this trip. This would make a great session IPA.
Deschutes Horse Ridge IPA;Bend, Oregon, United States;IPA;Deschutes Brewery;Draught at the Bend brewpub. Medium amber with a lacey head. Lots of hops in the aroma with juicy tangerine and grapefruit, and some sticky dank as well. Bitter and resiny in the finish with some caramel flavor, but more just really hoppy with a big grapefruit and dank flavor. Medium bodied with somewhat coarse carbonation. Supposedly this was brewed with only wheat and crystal malt (not sure if i trust the bartender though) but you could have fooled me. I didn’t really get any wheat, but that could be due to all those hops...
Deschutes Horse Ridge IPA;Bend, Oregon, United States;IPA;Deschutes Brewery;Copper bronze, good lasting off white head disipated quickly. Enticing spicy raw hop resin and caramel nose with some alcohol apparent, Big sweet peppery mouthfull of caramel, malt and spicy hops. Some traces of toasted bread.. Alcoholic finish with the spicy malt notes well balanced by the solid hop bitterness. Absolutely loved the style of this brew
St. George American Brown Ale;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;St. George Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. Light lacing remained speckling around the sides of the glass. The smell was rich and roasty through a nice nutty caramel blend. Light cocoa in the background. The taste was enthusiastically sweet nutty and had a nice caramel to cocoa blend underneath. On the palate, it sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. The carbonation was pretty smooth. There was a nice creamy richness coating my tongue. Overall, this was a really nice brown ale that I would have again.
St. George American Brown Ale;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;St. George Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours dark amber with a nice pillow of head that fades slowly to a white halo. Slightly sweet aroma with only a hint of nuttiness. The taste is surprisingly complex with a bit of hoppy bite up front that gives way to a light toasted nut flavor. Very smooth and drinkable.
St. George American Brown Ale;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;St. George Brewing Company;Bottle pour into shaker. Typical nut brown color for a brown ale. The taste was not as typical with a nice hoppiness added to the nuttiness. A decent beer.
St. George American Brown Ale;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;St. George Brewing Company;"Bottle. Pours a clear dark brown with a medium tan/light brown head that dissipates quickly with lacing. Aroma is chocolate and a nutty/smoky note. The taste is smokey; much like a porter in body and flavor, with strong nutty malts and a bit of hop bitterness. All in all a good brown ale."
St. George American Brown Ale;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;St. George Brewing Company;Pours an almost opaque brown with a medium light tan head that lowers down but persists. Little lacing. Sweet caramel and toasted malt aromas balanced by a moderately bitter grass and resinous hops. Hint of raisins and tobacco in the finish. Moderate carbonation, medium body. Bitter finish. Not what I would expect in a classic brown ale, but good nonetheless.
St. George American Brown Ale;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;St. George Brewing Company;Robust chocolate malt aroma. Very dark amber color with a medium tan head. Sweet chocolate taste with a light bitterness mixed into the finish. Creamy palate.
St. George American Brown Ale;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;St. George Brewing Company;Got this is a trade with ksurkin. Thanks again. Smell malty and wet cloth like. Pours a honey gold brown. Nice white head. Tight. Definite hop bite on the front and ending of the brew. Malty sweetness in the middle gives me great pleasure. nice cabonation. Solid beer. I think I enjoy a little more malty brown ales than this more American version but still great.
St. George American Brown Ale;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;St. George Brewing Company;The last bottle I picked up from the brewery and the second of two brown variants. This version was more complex, had a thicker mouthfeel and more roasted notes. Finishes with coffee and baking chocolate. Nice.
St. George American Brown Ale;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;St. George Brewing Company;Deep brown pour with a thin brown head. Chocolate, molasses, toasted malts, milk aroma. Medium, smooth body. Chocolate flavor with toasted malt, molasses, biscuit, and a lightly herbal, fruity hop finish. Light bitterness. Very nice, full fledged brown.
St. George American Brown Ale;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;St. George Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Pours a deep chestnut brown with a nice half inch off white head that slowly settled. Aroma is dark, roasty malts, toasted nuts, caramel, and cocoa with a hint of piny hops. Flavor is well balanced between roasty, caramel malt, chocolate, and a pleasantly bitter bite of pine and floral hops through the finnish. Body is medium, with a slick, creamy texture and fizzy mouthfeel from the high carbonation.
Cest What Ginger;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;decent taste, but not much of it. that seems to be the story of this beer. aroma is good but mysteriously faint. quite thin
Cest What Ginger;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;This is ginger ale, without too much carbonation. Somewhat ginger aroma and taste, was hoping for some sort of bite I get from Jamaican style ginger beer. Clean your palate but if I must have soda, let it be soda. Thin mouthfeel.
Cest What Ginger;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;Light amber, medium carbonation, pour small but thick head. Aroma of honey, sweet malt and touch of ginger. Ginger is more pronounced in flavour . This is medium bodied beer . Light bitter finish . Worked nice . Glad to see decent ginger beer.
Cest What Ginger;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;I like Giner. I like Beer. I didn’t really like this ginger beer however. C’est What has long been one of my favourite haunts, so I will always praise the establishment and the fact that they will experiment. Sadly I found this one to be quite routine. Watery amber colour with very thin head. Ginger difficult to detect but it’s in there amongst the hops and spice. Moderately sweet malts and a crisp dry finish.
Cest What Ginger;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;Draught. Orange pour. Subtle spicy aroma - there’s ginger in there for sure. Kudos on getting the ginger to show its face in the taste as well - pity it is in a bit of a watery bland body, although there is a good crispness to the whole package. Ok.
Cest What Ginger;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;Clear copper w/ thin, frothy white head. Faint aroma of ginger & hops. Medium-light, slightly watery feel. Flavour of mild ginger & sweet malt. Moderately bitter, dry finish.
Cest What Ginger;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;Copper colour with a thin white head. The ginger aroma is fairly pronounced at a distance, but not so much up close - more earthy hops and Sprite. The flavour starts out malty, slightly cake-like. Towards the finish is turns slightly bitter with a hint of ginger late. Not bad actually - it has a refreshing crispness.
Cest What Ginger;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;Spicey, light aroma Woody, light brown. Lots of zip that I wouldn’t have identified as ginger if I hadn’t known it. Fairly bittered, crisp, a bit malty. Medium light body on a bitter finish.
Cest What Ginger;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;Pours a clear copper red with a frothed up thick creamy head that lasts for quite a long time. Smells of ginger (what a shock) and hops. At first, the ginger is most prominent, but after a while, the hops really seem to come out in the aroma. Has a creamy and slick mouthfeel with very low carbonation. Tastes of mild ginger (not enough as far as I’m concerned, I was disapointed) which tickles the tongue. Has a touch of honey and a light malted tone. The finish is bitter and over the course of the drink it collects into something more than you’d expect. The aftertaste grows and the ginger warms it. Okay, but, just an interesting beer.
Cest What Ginger;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;Faint aroma of ginger and malt, amber/copper, small vanilla custard head, nice lace. Stale malt taste at first, a fruity throat stinging after effect, rather than flavour, sourish. Light bodied, dry finish. At least they keep trying new things.
Warwickshire Mayflower;Cubbington, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Warwickshire Beer Co.;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Rugby BF. A dark brown beer with a vaguely fruity aroma. The taste is clean but a tad bland and uninteresting.
Downton Chimera Red;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Downton Brewery;[Cask at GBBF 2005] A pale dark orange - close to brown beer with a thin off-white head. The aroma is sweet malty with a light touch of hops. The flavor is weirdly spicy with coriander standing out combined with celery and yeast.
Downton Chimera Red;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Downton Brewery;Cask (handpump) at the Market Porter, Southwark. Reddish copper colour. Clean and reasonably bitter, with lots of dry malt. Some fruity notes on the nose. But its not very rich and the mouthfeel is a touch thin. It ends up feeling very dry but without enough body or character to quite cut it as an autumnal/winter beer.
Downton Chimera Red;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Downton Brewery;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Ruddy beer, with a bit of a head. Pretty decent stuff, in an Autumnal stylee. Nutty, with sweet malts and some crunchy fizz. Has a metal tang, but certainly drinkable.
Downton Chimera Red;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Downton Brewery;Well, not that bad, I expected a squash beer, but it was not, it was a little sweet in aroma, and the after taste was not that bad. Amber in colour and with foam.
Downton Chimera Red;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Downton Brewery;Cask (Wetherspoons): Amber-copper in colour with a short beige head. Subdued fruity malt aroma. Flavour is rather bland, just mildly fruity malts with a bitter nondescript finish. Medium bodied bitter.
Downton Chimera Red;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Downton Brewery;Dark red with purple darkness. Aromas are hoppier than I expected with light malts. Flavours are smokey floral hops with very light malts. Too mild for its own good.
Downton Chimera Red;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Downton Brewery;Rare Breeds Fest. Amber from the side but a beautiful cherry red from on top. Beautifully roasty & chicory aroma. Gently sweet and full bodied malt with a little nettle finish. Interesting.
Downton Chimera Red;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Downton Brewery;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Rugby BF. A dark brown bitter with a slight maly aroma. The taste is also reasonably malty but there is not enough character. Average.
Facers Landslide;Flint, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Facers Brewery;Mild and easy to drink, smooth and velvety head, with some body. Flavour woody with some fruit ..... tangerine and cream? Finishes with orange bitterness and floral hops. Sessionable!
Facers Landslide;Flint, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Facers Brewery;Cask conditioned at Fleetwood Beer Fest ’13. Gold with slight head. Quite a perfumed flavour to this beer, lychee’s was the closest that we came up with, then a light herby note. A little thin and short. Fairly average.
Facers Landslide;Flint, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Facers Brewery;6th August 2009 GBBF Cask. Clear amber - gold beer. Light dry palate. A little soft fruit, peach and a tiny bit of orange. Not bad.
Facers Landslide;Flint, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Facers Brewery;Golden colour. Earthy, mossy hop character. Nice, fruity (berry), herbal character with a gentle, sugary malt sweetness. Balanced, nice easy drinking character. The finish has nuances of acidity and mineral.
Facers Landslide;Flint, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Facers Brewery;Cask @ The Raven, Bath (Coastal Beer festival). Straight gold. Not much head. Floral aroma. Soft palate. The flavors are strongly cereal like wholemeal corn flakes. Interesting malt character. Is a sweet, mild brew with decent body, unique character, and finishes pretty clean and dry.
Facers Landslide;Flint, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Facers Brewery;Cask, handpump at The Mill Hotel, Chester, Cheshire, 25-04-10 This is crystal clear gold with a white head.

Facers Landslide;Flint, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Facers Brewery;Gravity cask, sample on the third day of GBBF 09. Shiny golden body. Fresh fruity aroma of peaches and oranges. Taste of hop resin, notes of berries and subdued malty sweetness. Prolonged aftertaste of rounded bitterness. Refreshing. A Welsh bitter over the average for the style &#40Earls Court, 06.08.2009&#41.
Facers Landslide;Flint, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Facers Brewery;Cask@GBBF 2009. Golden color, small white head. Sweet caramel-sugary aroma with some hops. Ditto the flavor: sweet with wort, light flowery hops and malts.

Blencowe Mild Mannered Boys;Barrowden, Rutland, England;Mild Ale;Barrowden;Cask conditioned - no sparkler. Little aroma to this dark brown mild ale. The taste is malty and a tad roasty. It is an acceptable but unexceptional mild.
Spurgeon Vineyards Mead;Highland, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Spurgeon Vineyards;[bottle] shared by skyview. Pours nearly perfectly clear with no head. Aroma is sweet honey and some alcohol. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than it probably should be. Not too hot, but the alcohol lingers on the finish. Overall a pretty drinkable mead.
Spurgeon Vineyards Mead;Highland, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Spurgeon Vineyards;(bottle, thanks Skyview) Pours completely clear, and as OSLO said, it looks like water. Light aroma of honey, with a hint of raisin. The taste is like grape kool-aid with an odd finish that isn’t too pleasing. Light mouthfeel.
Spurgeon Vineyards Mead;Highland, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Spurgeon Vineyards;Shared by Skyview. I do like mead but this one was not so good. Clear appearance, which is fine. Light honey aroma. Just a little sweet in the flavor, with sort of an astringent quality that I didn’t care for. On the thin side for palate as well.
Spurgeon Vineyards Mead;Highland, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Spurgeon Vineyards;Thanks to skyview. clear, clover blossom and citrus and honey aroma. flavors of raisins, sweet honey brown sugar. but not syrupy sweet. light and crisp.
Spurgeon Vineyards Mead;Highland, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Spurgeon Vineyards;"Courtesy of Skyview. Clear ""color"". Very light aroma of clover honey. Light, sweet honey flavor. A little floral and a bit more of the clover honey. Interesting..."
Spurgeon Vineyards Mead;Highland, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Spurgeon Vineyards;Picked up a single 750 ml bottle at Mars Cheese Store near Kenosha, Wisconsin. Pours a clear and thick watery looking wine with no head or bubbles. Aroma of light pear, honey, some floral scents and white grape skins. Taste is oily, semi-sweet with flavors of honey, pears and a touch of wintergreen. Finish has a high alcohol character with some mixed aftertaste of honey and some phenol medicine.
Spurgeon Vineyards Mead;Highland, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Spurgeon Vineyards;A hint of yellow to the otherwise clear still liquid. I catch resin, glue, oak, pine and some dried sweet herbs in the aroma. Taller thick legs, the alcohol seems to hold the top quite awhile. THe longer I sniff the more it is starting to smell like kerosene. Mild plum brandy flavors. A mead that, without the strength, has slivovitz qualities. Oak and nuts in the finish. A interesting coconut milk linger. Medieval, I can agree with that part. Seems old and unclean.
Spurgeon Vineyards Mead;Highland, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Spurgeon Vineyards;"750 ml bottle. This was an alleged four year old bottle from Ray Daniel’s cellar given to the folks at Perfect Brewing who kindly gave it to me. Pale yellow in color, not pretty but that’s supposed to be what this stuff looks like. The aroma is full of phenol alcohols, malt, honey, and of course sweet. At four years this one has no body left. Like water. Sweet sugar flavors, sugar/honey water. mmm ... i wish i could say better things about this ""table mead"" but I can’t."
Spurgeon Vineyards Mead;Highland, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Spurgeon Vineyards;sample from holdenn. i’m not one to complain about free mead, even when the mead was given to holdenn, but this is one watery mead. notes of honey, pear, apples, and avian. slightly sweet, and totally boring.
Spurgeon Vineyards Mead;Highland, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Spurgeon Vineyards;"750 ml bottle, from the Mars Cheese Castle in Kenosha, Wisconsin (December 2006) sampled froma White Winter Winery glass at just above fridge temperature. Pours very clear, slightly oily almost colorless, just a hint of yellow-green, with legs very faint and immediately falling....dry, tart apple aroma for the most part, simple floral touches, very faint and innocuous at first though a sour, vegetal smell creeps in and eventually dominates....dry, excessively tannic and woody with again virtually no hint of honey, salty and grainy and actually spoiled/lactic tasting, absolutely undrinkable....couldn’t be cork-tainted, at least not in the conventional sense as it’s artificially corked.....whatever the reason, I’m hardly anxious to find out more; I have to give this a minimal score, this is one of the 2 or 3 most horrifying, foul beverages I’ ever tasted, and I’ve had 28-year-old Billy Beer. After about 10 minutes of this being open and trying to choke down another sip or two I really came close to vomiting, the aroma got to be so bad, and I poured 98% of it down the drain .... how could this happen? Buyer beware!"
Rabbits Foot Dry Mead;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Mead;Rabbits Foot Meadery;"Bottle from: Whole foods. Visual: light gold. Clear, shallow rim, medium legs. Nose: Acetone, nail polish remover, and oak sawdust. Palate: Light body, extremely over-oaked and nail polish remover. Very little if any honey character. Conclusion: Undrinkable. I have purchased this honey wine from several different vendors over time because I thought there must just had been a bottle defect. I cannot believe a commercial Meadery would release such a poorly made product to the public. I would be embarrassed to do so. If you like the taste of oak sawdust mixed with paint remover this is for you. The description on the back label said, ""with a hint of honey."" Imagine that, a Mead with a hint of honey? Bottle was not hand numbered and signed as claimed."
Rabbits Foot Dry Mead;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Mead;Rabbits Foot Meadery;"Bottle ($14.99). Pours a clear, golden yellow color, with no head but medium legs. The aroma is interesting. Sesame seeds and dates predominate. Cinnamon, cork, cedar continue. Earthy, spicy, persimmon; surprisingly complex! Buttery, complex. Pappy [bourbon, (very) good bourbon] like vanilla tones. I am liking this more with each sniff. Taste is dry, oaky, cork, sesame, lots of vanilla, date and aged bourbon barrel usage. I am surprisingly LOVING this, and I was expecting another mediocre Rabbit’s Foot product. Very dry, very complex. Peppery, like some very fine and expensive wines I have had the pleasure of trying. Pungent and a tad vinous. Thick and weighted mouthfeel. Holy crap, count me as very pleasantly surprised by this one!!!! Overall: a super COMPLEX and bourbon like mead from a otherwise mediocre meadery!"
Rabbits Foot Dry Mead;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Mead;Rabbits Foot Meadery;Sampled @ Rabbits Foot tasting room poured a clear gold [still]. Aromas of honey, pepper and some light oak. Palate was light bodied and dry. Flavors of light honey with a hint of grapes and a warming dry finish.
Rabbits Foot Dry Mead;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Mead;Rabbits Foot Meadery;2006 Intl Mead Fest. No head (still). Body is light yellow. Aroma is notes of honey, vanilla, sherry, wood, flowers. Flavor is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Light to medium body, watery texture, flat carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic. Yes, it’s a dry mead, and that’s a shame because the aroma is beautiful. The thing is, I just don’t enjoy dry meads (just as I’m not big on dry Riesling). If you do, ignore my flavor/mouthfeel score and check this out. If the aroma of this sample was typical (and judging from the overall average so far, it may not be), I would love it if they would age/oak their sweet mead this way (which I sampled, but did not bother rating as it was quite boring).
Rabbits Foot Dry Mead;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Mead;Rabbits Foot Meadery;Golden color. Aroma was hard liquor, Scotch notes, honey. SMooth and watery texture. Silky. Flavor was a little rough. Alcohol dominates. Didn’t much care for this.
Rabbits Foot Dry Mead;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Mead;Rabbits Foot Meadery;Shiny yellow-tinted liquid, no head...paint thinner or maybe freshly painted walls...burning plastic...dry, grapey...Deathly medicinal tasting and down right satanically WRONG! Burnt marshmellows..acidic rubbing alcohol...is this stuff suppoed to be enjoyable??
Peoples Pint Slippery Slope;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Mead;Peoples Pint;Nice example of a Braggart style ale. Malt and apple seem to blend seamlessly with ginger to create a very unique palate and mouth feel. As a cider snob this is as close as I’ve come to enjoying a non- cyzer malt / cider ferment. Much better with age. 6 mos - year seems ideal based on my taste tests.
Peoples Pint Slippery Slope;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Mead;Peoples Pint;22 oz bottle. From the Brew Pub, 20102 vintage. Nose is a really pleasant crisp apple and ginger root. Very low carbonation with no head. As this mead warms up, it really is exactly as the bottle description. Apple cider upfront and the cider maks up the body. The honey is very subdued yet can be found Mid-sip. Ginger root rounds out the flavors in the finish.
Peoples Pint Slippery Slope;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Mead;Peoples Pint;Bomber shared by Doodler (thanks Scott) poured a hazy amber with a small lingering amber head. Aromas of ginger, carmel, apple and light honey. Palate was light to medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of honey, ginger, apple, spice and light earthiness with a smooth lingering ginger finish.
Peoples Pint Slippery Slope;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Mead;Peoples Pint;Bomber shared at Southampton. Murky, honey pour. Quarter inch of white head. Looks like farmhouse cider. Smell is strong with ginger & rubbing alcohol. Cider & floral notes in the backdrop. Taste is crazy potent, tangy ginger cider. Doughy malt. Sharp sweetness. Hard alcohol. Lemon. Yeasty finish. Decent carbonation, but very itchy/starchy. Real flavors save it from a very bare bottom rate, but just way too much of everything. This is Cave Creek Chili, Dixie White Moose level dare stuff.
Peoples Pint Slippery Slope;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Mead;Peoples Pint;Bomber from Odeed shared with my son Enniskillen. Nose is heavy with ginger, alcohol, with hints of apple and honey. Murky amber with a small beige head. Flavor is of strong ginger just about like an alcoholic ginger beer. Body is very thin and it finishes with ginger.
Peoples Pint Slippery Slope;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Mead;Peoples Pint;The aroma is, as Tom said, like jet fuel - or that of grain alcohol, spruce, and bitters. The clear amber color has a bubbly white head. The flavor is nothing like the color, but like a thinner cider, big notes of apple cider vinegar dominate the flavor.
Peoples Pint Slippery Slope;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Mead;Peoples Pint;Nice clear golden color. I was a little apprehensive at first, because I’m not a huge fan of honey, but this was good. The apple flavor was pronounced, but not overwhelming, the honey notes were mellow and subtle. It had a nice crisp mouthfeel, but not fizzy.
Peoples Pint Slippery Slope;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Mead;Peoples Pint;Bottle shared by JW77...yessir. Copper color. Aroma is fruity as hell, lots of stone fruit and honey. Some caramel notes as well. Flavor is sweet/tart with apple, pearts and honey. Good.
Peoples Pint Slippery Slope;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Mead;Peoples Pint;22oz bottle-pours a white bubbly head and hazy amber color. Aroma is peach, nectarine, persimmon, papaya, spice, perfumy, sweet light/medium malt. Taste is tart/sour lemon and herbal-ginger, jump out front, then honey, fruit-grape/apple. Interesting. Occasional.
Peoples Pint Slippery Slope;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;Mead;Peoples Pint;Draught sample. Pours copper with a thin white head. Smells of honey, cider, barley. Tastes of honey, apples, some caramel. Nice!
Peoples Pint Spring IPA;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Peoples Pint;Art of Beer Festival 2004: Has a light reddish orange color and a small white head. Smell is of hops. Taste is of sweet malts and has a hop finish. Overall a little too sweet for my IPAs.
Peoples Pint Spring IPA;Greenfield, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Peoples Pint;Light copper in color with a small white head. Sweet malt and citrus hop aroma.Flavor is consistant with aroma and much too sweet for my taste.
Yaletown Short Sleeve Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Dark orange color, untypicall for Pilsner. Nice very bitter pilsener taste. I enjoyed it.
Yaletown Short Sleeve Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Yaletown Brewing Co.;On tap at Yaletown Brew Pub. Pours hazy yellow, thin white head. Nose is soft grains, skunky hops, earthy, mild, correct. Palate is butter, weedy/skunky hops, clean, fresh, odd finish. Very resiny.
Yaletown Short Sleeve Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Yaletown Brewing Co.;On draught at the brewpub in downtown Vancouver (Yaletown sector), Canada. Pours a clear straw blonde brew, lots of carbonation bubbles, with a fast dissolving white head that quickly dissipates to a thin white ring. Aroma is challenging to detect as bleach and chlorine is present in the glass. When ever this happens ask your server to bring a small glass with soda water. Add a little salt in the glass and rinse it out. Use the new glass as your tasting glass. Anyway... Aroma of light pear and apple fruit, some white bread dough, a touch of grassy hops and some mild yeast. Taste is light bodied, plenty of carbonation with flavors of light fruit, white bread malt and some grassy/vegetable hops. Finish is semi-dry with a mild toasted white bread malt aftertaste.
Yaletown Short Sleeve Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Hazy gold,lasting white head.Fine intense bead. Light spicy nose.Spicy saaz profile decent balance, long finish.Gassy, good lace
Yaletown Short Sleeve Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Yaletown Brewing Co.;"Slightly hazy amber colour with big frothy head. Saazy, bready aroma is light but shows potential. Fresh, creamy character blends a light saaz character with doughy malts. There’s a bit of diacetyl, too. I don’t care if it’s considered ""appropriate in small amounts"". There’s more of it here than in Pilsner Urquell, and I hate diacetyl. Once it gets on your palate, it really ruins the good work the malt and hops are trying to do."
Yaletown Short Sleeve Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Golden in color, medium saaz aroma, crisp light hoppy saaz flavour. Was a bit on the thin side.
Yaletown Short Sleeve Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Slight chill-hazed appearance with a creamy white head and rich golden colour. Malty caramel smell, yeast and some faint citrus notes. Decent maltiness with good body. Flavour is grassy and herbal with very good bitterness on the finish.
Rock Bottom Cleveland Rye;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Rock Bottom Cleveland (CraftWorks);"On tap, 5/15/2004. Starts with a big ""Zing"" down the center of the tongue, cushioned by sweetness on the sides. After the third or fourth sip, the finish gains a huge rye bread flavor - this is totally toasted and butterd rye bread CRUST - nice flavors! Surprisingly low aroma in this. (typical of my experiences here). Waitress said this had 12% rye in the grain bill."
Rock Bottom Cleveland Alt;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rock Bottom Cleveland (CraftWorks);"On tap 5/15/2004. Nice: sweet malty aroma, hazy brown body, medium head and lacing. Begins sugar/cinnamon sweet; bready, and ends with a long subtle and warm bitterness. Body smooth - nice and medium thick, very softly carbonated. Had an extra pint of this one."
Föroya Bjór Bryllupsbryg;Klaksvik, Faroe Islands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Föroya Bjór;"From the 2004 program my wife was about to throw away. Scarce note saying: ""sweet, breadish and light fruity. Why did I spent my token on this"" :)"
Föroya Bjór Bryllupsbryg;Klaksvik, Faroe Islands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Föroya Bjór;Draught, at DBF 2004 (040515). Golden with a white head. Aroma malty (fruit) and hoppy. Flavor sweet and bitter.
Föroya Bjór Bryllupsbryg;Klaksvik, Faroe Islands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Föroya Bjór;Dark golden coloured. Quite malty and sweet. Slightly thin, but not bad at all.
Föroya Bjór Bryllupsbryg;Klaksvik, Faroe Islands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Föroya Bjór;Golden colour with a quickly diminishing head. Very forgetable aroma and flavour. Not at all a full-bodied beer nor a good one.
Föroya Bjór Bryllupsbryg;Klaksvik, Faroe Islands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Föroya Bjór;Bottle, DBF 2004. Gold, thin white head and low condition. Insipid malt in the nose, some fruitiness creeping into the mouth and a forgetable finish. An embarrasing Best Mans speech of a beer.
Föroya Bjór Bryllupsbryg;Klaksvik, Faroe Islands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Föroya Bjór;An orange beer with no head. The aroma is sour with notes of caramel and citrus - I wonder if there is brewing cereal in this one. The flavor is very hoppy which gives it a dry end combined with celery. The body is thin, especially considering the 5.8% ABV.
Föroya Bjór Bryllupsbryg;Klaksvik, Faroe Islands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Föroya Bjór;Golden color with a white head. The taste is light earthy malts with a nice full taste and a light hoppy finish.
Föroya Bjór Bryllupsbryg;Klaksvik, Faroe Islands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Föroya Bjór;Sampled from bottle at Danish Beer Festival 2004 (#12). Golden body with a fine head. Somewaht sour malty aroma. Flavor is dry and bitter hoppy. More a pilsner than a bock and extremely bland.
Föroya Bjór Bryllupsbryg;Klaksvik, Faroe Islands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Föroya Bjór;"Bottled Deep golden. Green apples and menthe up front. Sweet and mellow, quite sticky. Is this an attempt by the Faroese to hint that the don’t care much for the Danish rule?;-)"
Föroya Bjór Bryllupsbryg;Klaksvik, Faroe Islands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Föroya Bjór;Draught @ DBF2004: Golden coloured. Clear. White head. Hops and malt in the aroma. Hops dominant in the flavour. A little boring. Is sweetish in the aftertaste.
Wig & Pen Russian Imperial Stout;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Wig & Pen Brewery;March 2018 bottling. Pours opaque black with a dense brown head. Pronounced initial aroma of olives, eventually dissipating entirely as it sits, giving way to malts, acidic fruit and heavily roasted coffee. Medium sweetness, strong burnt bitterness. Medium-full body, soft carbonation, very creamy with a lingering burnt bittersweet finish.
Wig & Pen Russian Imperial Stout;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Wig & Pen Brewery;Wig and pen Russian imperial Aroma: sweet malt, 6 App: black flat head 3 Flavour: loads of balanced sweet malt, some dark fruit 8 Palate: finishes nutty 3 Overall 16
Wig & Pen Russian Imperial Stout;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Wig & Pen Brewery;Weekend of Darkness 2015. Good classic stout pour. Aroma is subtle dark malts - not big on smell. Taste is dark malt richness without being astringent, nice sweetness, subtle. Palate is nice texture - silky smooth. Very solid RIS.
Wig & Pen Russian Imperial Stout;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Wig & Pen Brewery;I’m just updating my records. Had this beer at the Australian beer festival at the rocks. A great big and strong stout.
Wig & Pen Russian Imperial Stout;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Wig & Pen Brewery;the essential Aussie beer geek beer. on tap. pours black with just a ringed collar. Much better looking as drank on and get a dark brown head with swirling. nose is of alcohol, wood, char, licorice, chocolate and dark fruits. Big and bold. licorice at first and changes to fruit, chocolate, smoke, ash and char. Nice Thick and coating in the mouth. Still a bit hoppy in the end with some char and burnt tires. Best RIS in Australia.
Wig & Pen Russian Imperial Stout;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Wig & Pen Brewery;Figure I should finally rate the original Australian geek beer. In 2004 I travelled to Canberra on the release weekend just to try it. I would have given it low 4s back then, but I think my tastes must have changed now. Standard serve is 330mL (in a FULL snifter - geez) when you can get halves of most other stuff, and it’s just WAY too much. Nice aroma of tar, raspberries and heaps of woody mid-range coffee notes with little hop. On the palate it’s HEAVY. There’s clearly a lot of roast and hop bitterness in there, but it’s just swallowed up by the glycerol-like malt richness. Not sweet as such, just massive. It just desperately needs something (roast, bitterness, acid) to cut through it to make it drinkable. Of course serving it in such big glasses doesn’t help either. Absolutely unique beer, perhaps as big a mouthfeel as I’ve ever come across, and a real icon of the Aussie micro scene. Shame I didn’t like it more.
Wig & Pen Russian Imperial Stout;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Wig & Pen Brewery;Wow. This is a huge beer. Opaque black, softly carbonated, with a medium head. Would have been rated 4.8 if it didn’t have such an alcohol taste to it. More floral/ctirus notes than coffee/smoke which when added to the intensity, makes it world class. Awesome stuff.
Wig & Pen Russian Imperial Stout;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Wig & Pen Brewery;On tap. Beautiful beer, nice aroma of coffee, lasting complex flavour, bitter ending. The high alcoholic content is not overwhelming. One of the best beers I ever tried.
Wig & Pen Russian Imperial Stout;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Wig & Pen Brewery;Tap. Black ale with a small dark brown head. Smells and tastes of dried fruit, chocolate and wood. Dense creamy mouthfeel and finishes with a pronounced bitterness. This is world class.
Wig & Pen Russian Imperial Stout;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Wig & Pen Brewery;This is easily one of the best beers i have ever tasted. Big rich deep burnt creamy molasses aroma. Mouthfeel is even bigger with well balanced combination of alcholol, malt, roastness and bitterness. An exceptional beer.
Barley Johns Alfreds Porter;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Tap at the brewpub - wow, what a find! Hasn’t been on in years, but here it is. Super dark dense oily pour with a correspondingly slick dense palate. Roasty, boozy warmth, licorice. Yum.
Barley Johns Alfreds Porter;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Pitch black with a thin head of nut tan. Highly concentrated aroma of smoke, chocolate cake, rum, cherrries, raisins and brandy. Supple and seductive, yet somewhat reserved. Flavor is extremely sweet, sugary and grainy. Loaded with coffee, kahlua and hint of juniper. Alcohol very notable, but not harsh or detracting, instead warming and rounding. Sugary malt with brown sugar, cane sugar and some Mexican chocolate, swept up in a fresh vanilla bean. Lacks a bite or movement that makes you stand up and take notice. Maintains oilyness and smoothness across the palate, with creaminess that just dissolves into the tounge. Sublime.
Barley Johns Alfreds Porter;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Baltic in name only. Light coffee aroma. Black with a very small tan head. The dominant flavor is bitter coffee with lighter chocolate. Tastes like a dry stout as it warms.
Barley Johns Alfreds Porter;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Black no head. Very sweet and soft. Creamt mouthfeeling. Finish is warming and sweet. The alcohol is well balanced with the flavour. A powerful pleasant stout.
Barley Johns Alfreds Porter;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Barley Johns Brew Pub;An opaque black beer with a disappearing brown head. The aroma is sweet with notes of alcohol, over ripe fruits, and prunes. The flavor is sweet with notes of prunes, chocolate, toffee, and grass.
Barley Johns Alfreds Porter;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Hand bottled from growler by Footbalm and send to Denmark - thanks a lot! Pitch black with almost no head. Dark heavy roasted aroma with coffee and liquorice and some alcohol. Very sweet flavor of brown sugar, coffee and roast. Full bodied and tasty but too sweet to be excellent.
Barley Johns Alfreds Porter;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Hand bottled by Footbalm from a growler. Bottle sealed with wax: Pitch black colour. Has a medium sized dense brown head. Alcohol, fruit, grass, toffee, nuts and a light roast in the aroma. Sweets, marcipan, light roast, chocolate and light coffee in the flavour. The alcohol is there, but quite well hidden. Is a little watery IMO. Has a sweetish light cloying end. Some vague roastyness and a good warmth on the lips. Nice one. Thanks again to footbalm for these 3 gigantic brews from Barley John.
Barley Johns Alfreds Porter;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Bottled. Almost black coloured. Vanilla and chocolate aroma. Extremely sweet flavour. Notes of vanilla. Full bodied.
Barley Johns Alfreds Porter;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Tap @ Brewery in March 2005 when I was back in Minnesota. I grew up only a few miles away from this brewery, although I was long gone before it opened for business. Black color with a laced brown head. The aroma had lots of vanilla, alcohol, toffee and some toasted malts. Very sweet finish but at the beginning it had a roasted lingering malty dryness. Fantastic.
Barley Johns Alfreds Porter;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Imperial;Barley Johns Brew Pub;The Lure: Sweet soy components roam amidst the wealthy malt. Roastiness emanates from the mix and ably joins some dates and dark chocolate. The Festivities: Fat dark chocolate malts lie on roasted cereal flakes. Alcohol flames scorch the back of the palate, but the soothing carbonation and balming malts reconcile it all. Not super-complex, but these guys can really brew high octane beers with aplomb. Transcendence: A simple giant with a heart of gold.
Barley Johns Dark Mild;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Draft. 2010 St. Paul Summer Fest. Poured a dark brown with a slight head. Some chocolate notes in the aroma along with some malts. Nice bite of the roasted malts with the first sip. Nor bad but not outstanding either.
Barley Johns Dark Mild;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Tap. Dark brown with a thin off-white head. Aroma is dry and malty with hints of choclate. Flavor is also dry with roasted malt, chocolate, some breadiness, and an interesting bitterness seemingly derived from something other than hops. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. My first Mild and I am not sure what to think.
Barley Johns Dark Mild;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Sampled via growler pour thanks to Doug H at the 29th Annual ABA Meeting in Bloomington, MN. Pours an opaque dark brown brew with a fast dissolving beige head that dissipates clean, no ring, no film top. Aroma of roasted dark malt, a hint of chocolate, and some dry leafy and floral hops. Taste is medium to full bodied, soft carbonation with flavors of toasted chocolate malt, and some light yeast. Finish is balanced with floral hop and dark malt aftertaste.
Barley Johns Dark Mild;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Dark color roasted malts and faint chocolate on the nose. Satisfying body similar to the aroma but stronger and a bit grainy.
Barley Johns Dark Mild;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Tap @ the brewpub. Color is a very dark brown, looks black. On top sits a khaki head. Aroma is light roast with faint tobacco slickness. Overall the aroma is fumy and full. Taste is a light mineral, dark chocolate, and roast. As advertised, its totally sessionable yet full of flavor. However, it is really more like a stout then a Mild Ale (from my ideas of the styles).
Barley Johns Dark Mild;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Barley Johns Brew Pub;On tap at brewpub **Aroma / Appearance** - Deep black and fluid it is darker than some other milds. Filled to the brim there was no head when it came to the table. Roasted coffee and chocolate gave it a light porter feel without the thickness. **Flavor / Palate** - Coffee, dark chocolate, and barley it goes down easily. A hoppy residual finish wraps up an excellent and sessionable experience. This could be a daily drinker if it was not tap only.
Barley Johns Dark Mild;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Dark with a white head. Enjoyed on-tap at the brewpub. A good effort, complex with chocolate malt, decent IBU. Drying. Like the brown without the wild rice,a slightly more bitter dunkelweizen. A good effort of the style and one I could drink at any meal.
Barley Johns Dark Mild;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Dark Black Coloring. Roasts. Some Malt. Bitterness. Definitly a Mild Ale... Not my Favorite Offering.
Barley Johns Dark Mild;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Nearly black color, quite odd and unusual for a mild. Very bitter taste with only light malts. The bitterness did not, however, seem to come from hops. Not their best effort.
Barley Johns Dark Mild;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Small sample at the brewpub. Chocolaty nose, near black. Dry, fairly hoppy, cardboard and light sour grapiness, mouthtickling, good late maltiness. Nope, still haven’t figured out milds.

Pours a hazy pale yellow with a white head. Dry hoppy aroma. Notes of brett, horse stable and citrus. Decent and quite interesting. Flavour is tart with dry hops, citrus and brett.

Ørbæk Wedding Beer;Ørbæk, Denmark;Scottish Ale;Ørbæk Bryggeri;(Bottle 75 cl) Typically flat Ørbæk carbonation and the typical Ørbæk house character although a new yeast has been used for this - a Scotch ale yeast. Very dark, almost mahogany. Sweetish yet with a solid hoppy bite. Quite refined, almost vinous beer. 060704

Ørbæk Wedding Beer;Ørbæk, Denmark;Scottish Ale;Ørbæk Bryggeri;"Wonderful brown colour with a reddish glow but a disappointing head. Decent aroma and flavour with some malts, dark fruits, acidity, and perhaps yeast. The initial sweetness is hence being balanced by a mild acidity rather than a ""real"" bitterness. Definitely not my favourite Ørbæk beer, but better than a lot of the other bland and commercial ""wedding beers""."
Ørbæk Wedding Beer;Ørbæk, Denmark;Scottish Ale;Ørbæk Bryggeri;Bottle, DBF 2004. Orange bronze, no head and fine condition. Low thin malt in the nose, some citric fruit in the mouth and a developing bitterness in the finish. Nothing special.

Carlsberg Brown Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Brown Ale;Carlsberg Brewery;A decent drink in the end, although I was scepticle as trying this since I dislike original Carlsberg, I was moderately suprised at its difference.
Carlsberg Brown Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Brown Ale;Carlsberg Brewery;Malty sweet, not very balanced. Brown ale? More like a sticky Central European dunkel, if you ask me.

Carlsberg Brown Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Brown Ale;Carlsberg Brewery;Tap, DBF 2004. Amber brown, thin shortlived white head and gentle condition. Faint caramel and grain in the nose, sweet toffee and some grssy hops in the mouth and a finish that just seems thin and bitter. Not my idea of a brown ale.

Tuborg Chili-Øl;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Carlsberg Brewery;On tap) Bitter carbonated water with a buttery feeling and an overload of chilli. Nothing moreto say, hope they had fun making it, but why?
Tuborg Chili-Øl;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Carlsberg Brewery;An orange beer with no head. The aroma is dominated by chili - not very beer like. The flavor is also dominated by chili. An interesting beer.
Tuborg Chili-Øl;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Carlsberg Brewery;[Draught] Weak aroma. Smells like normal Grøn Tuborg. Thin and sweet pilsener flavour with a slight chili burn in the aftertaste. I cannot think of any other use of this beer than for pranks.
Tuborg Chili-Øl;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Carlsberg Brewery;Tap, DBF 2004. Gold, low white head and moderate condition. Gentle malt in the nose gives little hint as to what will follow. In the mouth it starts sweet before a developing wave of hot chilli takes over, becoming oppresive in the finish. Pointless.
Tuborg Chili-Øl;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Carlsberg Brewery;Test beer @ DBF 04.Not much to say: i agree with madsberg: i also love chilli and i love beer, but this marriage wasnt a succesfull one! As Dixen stated: take a green tuborg and add chili.
Tuborg Chili-Øl;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Carlsberg Brewery;Golden color with a white head. The taste is water that burns. This should not be allowed.
Tuborg Chili-Øl;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Carlsberg Brewery;Draught @ DBF2004: Golden coloured. Has no head. Has a somewhat chemical and perfumed aroma. Flavour is watery and malty and ends up in this light chiliburnt on the lips. Quite funny sensation but not something I connect with and strive for in a beer. I love chili, and often use it in various ways in foods. This is my first chili beer. Conclusion Chili IMO dosn’t belong in beer.
Tuborg Chili-Øl;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Carlsberg Brewery;Draught at DBF 2004. This is horrific! This is the recipe i think: Take a normal Tuborg, add some water and some chili, and then you yourself a tuborg chili beer! Its watery and the flavor actually isnt real chili, it just burns in your throat! Horrific!
Tuborg Chili-Øl;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Carlsberg Brewery;Sampled from draught at Danish Beer Festival 2004 (#9). Clear dark golden beer with an ok head. Almost no aroma, only a little malt/hop and a spicy undertone (or is it just my imagination?). Flavor is like an ordinary Tuborg beer with a slight spicy tone. Only obvious sign of chili is a burnning feeling in my throat when the beer is swallowed. Not the best beer but Tuborg deserves an extra credit for doing something besides the ordinary.
Refsvindinge Jordbærbryg;Refsvindinge, Denmark;Flavored - Fruit;Refsvindinge Bryggeri;Draught@EBF2008 (backlog). Orangeish red colour, small white head.

Refsvindinge Jordbærbryg;Refsvindinge, Denmark;Flavored - Fruit;Refsvindinge Bryggeri;[Sampled in 2004.] A nice beer with a nice taste, but where are the strawberries. Thirstquencher!
Refsvindinge Jordbærbryg;Refsvindinge, Denmark;Flavored - Fruit;Refsvindinge Bryggeri;I imagined that this would be reddish - but no. It’s plain golden and the head is white. The aroma is hoppy and malty, and it has some vague and unclear notes, that COULD be berries. The flavour is pilsner-like and I get the thought: Why aren’t there any strawberries in MY beer :(( When I was almost through the finish I actually found a brief moment of weak strawberry flavour. It’s not bad, but I had looked forward to having a nice, strawberry beer, and as such it’s very disappointing.
Refsvindinge Jordbærbryg;Refsvindinge, Denmark;Flavored - Fruit;Refsvindinge Bryggeri;Bottle. Light red-brown colourith. White head head with a touch of pink. Bit sweet weak aroma of strawberries and some maltiness. The flavour has some weak strawberry along with some waterish malt and little hoppiness. Thin softdrink brew but worth trying.
Refsvindinge Jordbærbryg;Refsvindinge, Denmark;Flavored - Fruit;Refsvindinge Bryggeri;Cask at Copenhagen Beer Festival 2007. Like a pilsener, a light white head. Aroma moderate malty (light notes of strawbeeries). Flavor like a pilsener. Light body, almost flat.

Ceres Royal Amarillo;Århus, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ceres Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);Yellow beer with a small white head. Aroma of corn and hops.

Ceres Royal Amarillo;Århus, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ceres Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);This beer is light yellow and it has no head. The aroma is of citrus and hops.

Ceres Royal Amarillo;Århus, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ceres Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);[Draught] I cannot find much hops in this one. It tastes more of corn. Very thin and boring.
Ceres Royal Amarillo;Århus, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ceres Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);Tap, DBF 2004. Straw gold, thin white head, moderate condition.

Ceres Royal Amarillo;Århus, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ceres Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);Sampled from draught at Danish Beer Festival 2004 (#20). Very light yellow beer with a small disappearing white head. Aroma is very weak, I only sense a little bit of hop. The flavor is malty but very thin and not very bitter. A boring and uninteresting beer and where the hell is the Amarillo?
Ceres Royal Amarillo;Århus, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ceres Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);Draught at DBF 2004.. What a lousy beer!!! I was attracted by them Amarillo, thought i could taste some good hops... but no, there wasnt any hops in this beer. Fizzy, yellow and watery!
Ceres Royal Amarillo;Århus, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ceres Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);Sampled draught at Dansk Ølfestival. Pale yellow, clear small head. Sweet and mellow, corn is obvious. Watery. Supposedly this experimental beer is brewed with Amarillo hops, but it is impossible to detect any hops. Perhaps they had a picture of the hops posted in the brewery while they were brewing it? Completely lacking in character. Very low bitterness.

Olde Auburn Catch Her In The Rye;Auburn, Alabama, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Olde Auburn Ale House (AL);Brought to Tampa by brewer Jeremy, thanks buddy. Pours brilliant clear copper with white head. The aroma is pretty roasty with a solid rye component. Wow, nice and malty with mild hop notes I can’t really pin down. The taste is much the same starting with a vague yet varied hop bitterness and solid mild roastiness moving to chocolate malts followed up by a very tasty rye twang. Near pine bitterness sort of rises up into the finish to round this out.

Olde Auburn Catch Her In The Rye;Auburn, Alabama, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Olde Auburn Ale House (AL);Fairly light golden colour. Vague aroma of toast, earthy hop, maybe a hint of rye.

The pour is murky straw to amber, the head quickly leaving. Mostly bready, toasted malt notes. Scary apples and banana notes. Highly mineral.

John Harvard's Cambridge Heresy;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;2004 draught @ BBF. Light brown appearance with a touch of dark copper. Good white head. Smells of spice (clove, cinnamon, coriander, pepper) and dry wood. Body is medium, somewhat thin if I remember correctly, with a small amount of fruitiness, moderate belgian yeast presence and a very dry, somewhat astringent finish. There is a touch of sweet malt, that or perhaps some dark candi sugar. Anyways, it’s an interesting beer.

Ceres Royal Fusion;Århus, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ceres Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);An orange beer with no head. The aroma is light - what is there is malty. In the flavor the alcohol shines thru and prickles the tongue before a hoppy dry end sets in. It’s a mystery to me how a 5.5% ABV can taste of alcohol - it must be because there is nothing else put in, that tastes of anything.

Slightly simple pale lager palate, but it quenches the thirst satisfactorily. I won’t say it was good, but it was cleanish and had a decent enough level of taste, I can believe this might even be a premium all-malt lager rather than adjuncty swill.

Lake Louie Dark Shadows Series #2: Dinos Dark;Arena, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Lake Louie Brewing (Wisconsin Brewing Company);Decent enough. Poured at a good temperature with a smallish tan head that soon settled to little more than a ring and no lace. Color is a nice clear mahogany with a few bubble trails. Aroma I a malt, hop, a little roast, and some dark, ripe fruit. Flavor’s much like nose with tang and bitter in front, slight sweet behind, medicine in background. Body/carbonation ok. Finish is like flavor, on the long side, generally speaking hoppy porters aren’t my thing.
Lake Louie Dark Shadows Series #2: Dinos Dark;Arena, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Lake Louie Brewing (Wisconsin Brewing Company);Draft at Greenbush Bar. Pours a cloudy brown color with an inch of foamy tan head. Notes of chocolate, nuts, and toast, and a really nice earthy hop character throughout. Exactly meets the description. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a soft, earthy mouthfeel. Nice take on their own porter.
Lake Louie Dark Shadows Series #2: Dinos Dark;Arena, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Lake Louie Brewing (Wisconsin Brewing Company);Bottle:   Deep brown, cola hued edges, thin to moderate sudsy light beige head, spotty lacing.   Fairly assertive roasted malt aroma, resiny hops (minor), with a touch of coffee.   Similar tongue, a bit of bakers chocolate. &nbsp Slightly acrid tho.   Body and mouthfeel are moderate.   Finishes without the hops it started with, lingering roastiness.   Not bad, but seems pretty middle of the road.
Lake Louie Dark Shadows Series #2: Dinos Dark;Arena, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Lake Louie Brewing (Wisconsin Brewing Company);Pours a dark reddish brown with a small tan/brown head.

Lake Louie Dark Shadows Series #2: Dinos Dark;Arena, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Lake Louie Brewing (Wisconsin Brewing Company);"Poured into a pint glass. 3.5 A: Black color. Two fingers of frothy tan head. Retention is good and a short ring of lacing is left. 3.5 S: Grainy roastiness, chocolate, and tangy caramel. Good, but the tanginess puts this at a bit ""off."" Moderately malty. 3.0 T: Like the nose, but the tangy tartness is increased. It’s not an infection type tang, but it’s a sign of something not being done right along the brewing process. Still, it’s not bad. 3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. A touch crisp with a bit more creaminess. 3.0 D: Not bad, but not without problems. Good, strong flavors, but a couple bad ones as well. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 07-18-2012 00:35:09"

Tractor Brewing Double Plow Oatmeal Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Tractor Brewing Company;Not a stout fan, this one definitely just slips into he category of the typical stout. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Tractor Brewing Double Plow Oatmeal Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Tractor Brewing Company;This is one of my favorite tractor beers so far. It has a bit of bite to the mouth feel - which I like. It has earthy undertones with a slight burnt nutty finish. Nice and light for a stout - refreshing. It has a deep brown cloudy center. Only complaint is it doesn’t smell like much!

Tractor Brewing Double Plow Oatmeal Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Tractor Brewing Company;Beer #43 of NM 100. I almost really like it, but instead I just don’t like it. It has a super dry roasted grain flavor, but also then some other various nastiness. Not sure what, sometimes I find it chalky sometimes vegetal, sometimes cherry and acidic. I don’t know. I think the choice of hops is part of the problem strangely enough.
Tractor Brewing Double Plow Oatmeal Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Tractor Brewing Company;A little thinner than I’d like for the style. Clean and sweet, refreshing. Lacking some smoky depth and chocolate notes.

Lovejoys Enns River Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Tap. A pretty standard stout. Coffee flavor. Nasty aftertaste gives it some demerits. Darkish appearance, too small of a head. LJs has made better stouts.
Lovejoys Enns River Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Nice one, even in the heat of mid May in Texas (at brewers fest). Thick, tarlike, and with enough substance and character to carry over the IPA sampled prior and come out a winner.
Bitter End E.P.A.- Environmental Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Fluffy, bubbly white head, collapsing in small craters, some lace; very pale peach-yellow beer, hazy. ""Creamy"" nose - impossible to explain without blowing a hashish pipe - I suppose, short of experience. Notes of coffee - in a fully pale beer! Then hops to the fore, like a very-well hopped English ale. Quite bitter taste, bitterness growing even after first recognition, citrussy. Malt for balance is unmistakably. 25 IBU seems very low - it appears to be more. Notes of bitter grapefruit retronasal, gains also some hayaroma's. I have to admit it has a soft, creamy mouthfeel - I wasn’t expecting much of this, but it’s there allright. Surprisingly well-carbonised, but nowhere fizzy. Intruiging because of the rainwater, but interesting because of being one of the few organic beers worth its money. Good show - I hold this brewer in high esteem. Many thanks to the Dewberries!"
Bitter End E.P.A.- Environmental Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Light bread malt (L); flowery hops (VL); hint of lemons in the aroma. Hazy gold/peach body poured without a head. Lightly sweet, moderately acidic flavor becomes a lightly bitter, moderately acidic, slightly husky finish. Medium light body, watery texture, lively carbonation. The bottom line is: I found this beer to have more acidity than flavor, but I’m goofy like that."
Bitter End E.P.A.- Environmental Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Tap. Okay, let me start by saying that I’m not one to enjoy anything just because it’s ""organic"", and I don’t go out of my way to get extra enjoyment out of anything sold by hippies or nature freaks like in Austin. And before any of y’all say that I’m from Texas and so my opinion of rabid liberals doesn’t count, you ain’t been to Austin. The other day I was at a stop light, in the middle lane, and the car in front of me, and the ones to its left and right ALL had anti-Bush or pro-Kerry bumper stickers. This beer was a good example of environmental stuff actually coming through. The water came from the Bitter End head brewer’s house, where he has some rainwater catching and filtering system. It makes the mouthfeel something special - smooth, without a bite to it. Normally when I say that a beer doesn’t have bite, it’s a bad thing, but this one is different. It’s ""light"" in your mouth, for lack of a better word, almost as if the beer is disappearing in your mouth like cotton candy. The organic hops come on strong, punching through until the end. Some standard BE malts, I want more of this stuff!!"
Bitter End E.P.A.- Environmental Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Murky yellow body yet it is somewhat clear. Small white head.

Bitter End E.P.A.- Environmental Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Not only is this fantastic by concept, it’s actually a damn tasty beer, which makes it a winner for all. Cheers to Tim Schwartz and crew for another fine beer!
Draught House Biere De Garde;Austin, Texas, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Draught House Pub & Brewery;This was pretty boring and really reminded me of their Munich Dunkel. Very aniseedy smelling and exceedingly carbonated. Dark, poowater looking and not all that memorable honestly. G-rat
Draught House Biere De Garde;Austin, Texas, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Tap at Texas Craft Brewers Festival ’04. I have very limited experience with the style, but I just dont think this one made the grade. I appreciate Draught House taking this on, but I thought it was a very mild beer without anything distinctive to it. It had some bitter maltiness, nothing sweet nor sour that got me going. Very boring.
Draught House Biere De Garde;Austin, Texas, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Tap. Thickish caramel appearance. Decent maltiness, but I was expecting more of a sweet complexity that comes with others of the style.
Draught House Biere De Garde;Austin, Texas, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Going to ignore the comment of another at Texas Craft Brewers Festival that was really just making noise. Thought this had some spice and character to it. Will have to head back to the pub and take some better notes, but all in all I thought a good job was done on it.
Great Dane Maibock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Sampled from the tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear copper with a near white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has notes of sweet grains and straw with a hint of biscuit backing. Flavor is similar with sweet grains, bread and straw notes.
Great Dane Maibock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Keg @ Great Dane. Medium amber pour with a small head. Nose is malt-forward. Some glazed donut. Suggests a bit of booziness. Toasted grain. Light peppered grass. Flavor is a bit ragged. Some booze and windex. Soft plum fruit. Gentle grain. Medium body, very strong carb. Sort of a fiasco.
Great Dane Maibock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"Several draught pints and glasses at the Hilldale location, 2014-16, most recently in early June of this year. Pours a darker amber-gold than I might expect, almost clear, with a bit of lasting head....caramel-malty nose, a touch of darker, smokier stuff, light herbal qualities...body is lightly syrupy, moderately sweet - honey and a bit of raisin or dates perhaps - not at all hoppy/bitter, faintly smoky/burnt/caramelized throughout, and a bit dryer and more burnt at the finish...low carbonation, a bit sticky. Fairly similar to Capital’s Maibock, which I like a little more (and really should re-rate next time I have it); it’s a bit much, a bit sticky in a pint sample, which is the main difference - the Capital is just more drinkable and less heavy to my taste. In any case both are good reasons to look forward to spring."
Great Dane Maibock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft. Cherry, apple, toffee malt, and astringent alcohol aroma. Amber with small head.

Great Dane Maibock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Accompanied lunch on the day before GT ticket sales. On tap at the downtown Madison brewpub on Doty, and served to an imp. pint glass with a clear, amber hue, a modest amount of light tan, bubbles & cream head foam, and waves & spots of clingy lacing. The nose was light grain, a little sweetness, a touch of spice, and light hints of caramel and vanilla. A little better than softly carbonated, and medium bodied, the flavor also presented a low hop bitterness, light sweetness, and a subtle, finishing bitterness & dryness. Food complementary, quaffable, and fairly clean.
Great Dane Maibock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Courtesy of malachi. Bright orangish color. Huge nutty/caramel combo up front. Fades to biscuity/grainy character, hints of fruit. Flavor much the same, caramel and faint fruit character. Creamy smooth mouthfeel. No hop character whatsoever. If not for color would pass for a regular bock.
Great Dane Maibock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Blah overly sweet both in aroma and tAste but worse yet a very fake sugar sweetness that comes off like those crappy pink packets. Avg pal nice appearance downhill from there. I won’t drink it again
Bitter End 2XRyePA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Really murky, no head, and tons of pepper spice in the nose. Good effervesence on the tongue. Spice is right up front and the alcohol is quite evident. Traveled well also.
Bitter End 2XRyePA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Big hops with a bit of pumpernickel coming out of it, and an edge of alcohol. Woody in a way. Deep golden color. Syrupy palate, stinging with bitterness. Lively too. Long finish, bitter. Quite engaging. Thanks to Legion242 for hauling this back to Dallas! (growler)

Bitter End 2XRyePA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Poured cloudy amber with almost no head at all...smelled very floral at first, then citrus fruits...more sweetness in the mouth than I expected...a little bitter in the finish, but that goes away quickly due to the alcohol...a slight medicinal aftertaste...
Bitter End 2XRyePA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;From a growler from legion242, thanks for sharing. light hazy brown with a minimal head. sweet citrus hint to aroma. hops are present and citrusy throughout but is balanced with some sweetness in the flavor. alcohol bite on the finish.
Bitter End 2XRyePA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Although I’m rating this from memory I remember it quite well. This was the first brew I ever had at the Bitter End. Not bad. Sreved in a pilz glass. Exceedinlgy aniseedy and hoppy in the nose. Almost like a Barleywine though not overpowering enough to get you there. The Palate...as I remember was excellent...mor ebitter than floral. Good brew. G-rat
Bitter End 2XRyePA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Tap. Also known as ""Richter Scale Rye"". Amber, average head, slightly hazy. Attractive malty aroma, but the nice mellow flavor of the ""supa-fly rye"" and the higher alcohol content clash for me. I prefer the regular version."
Bitter End 2XRyePA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Dark red in color. Great head. Good lacing. Nice citrus hop nose. Nice hop bitterness and flavor with slightly dry finish. Very well balanced. This is a very drinkable beer.

Hydes Cloud Nine;Salford, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hydes Brewery;Cask Stillage at Edgeley Park, Stockport 04/06/2004 Golden coloured and very hoppy with some sour fruit flavour. Slightly dry crisp malt finish.
Hydes Cloud Nine;Salford, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hydes Brewery;Very pale amber colour. However, whilst it almost looks like a blonde ale, malt dominates the aroma and palate. Some subtle hop nuances in the flavour, but the mouthfeel is soft and there is a slightly clammy undertone. Clean, but rather unassertive finish. Not unpleasant, but nothing to really grab me here. I’m not entirely sure what the brewer is trying to achieve with this one. Cask (handpump), Lord Moon of the Mall (JDW) , Whitehall, London SW1.
Kamoizumi Nigori Ginjo Sake;Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Kamoizumi Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Pours a super cloudy, milky white. The nose is clean, a bit of a yeasty, earthy note, but driven by floral, fruity esters, and a touch savory. The flavor is super dry, there is no residual sugar here, still very floral, with the same earthy yeast character, mouth-watering acid, and a faint hint of light bitterness. The body is full and creamy, with a high acid, floral, and lightly yeasty finish.
Kamoizumi Nigori Ginjo Sake;Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Kamoizumi Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Noix de coco, parfum, melon d’eau et une vive acidité lactique dans l’arrière-goût. L’alcool n’est pas timide.

Kamoizumi Nigori Ginjo Sake;Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Kamoizumi Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Caraffel @ Hakkasan, NYC. A really light milky white cloudy thing this and it has tons of small white sediments this. Presume that’s why its called summer snow? Cloudy like you have put double cream in some water. Smells like sake alright with rice, starch, it’s kinda sugar sweet and I get some apples also. Sweet apples. Really dry-ish in the taste and unless it’s the psyche playing a trick on me there is a milky flavor as well. Coconut, rice and loaded with potato starch. Well... It’s not all that at first perhaps, but after a while it definitely grows on you. 20.06.2013
Kamoizumi Nigori Ginjo Sake;Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Kamoizumi Shuzo Co., Ltd.;"Bottle shared by my nephew whose friends gave it as a gift and supposedly came from Japan! Nose is casabas and coconuts with the normal ricy grains I smell in sakes; translucent very pale gold; flavor very smooth with a very much white melon flavor along with some alcohol warmth; finish is very slightly sweet and alcoholly! My nephew and his wife thought it stank, but I like it’s classy style. My nephew did like the Surly Darkness sample so he does like good beer if not good sake!"
Kamoizumi Nigori Ginjo Sake;Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Kamoizumi Shuzo Co., Ltd.;I finally caught up with Kamoizumi Nigori while dining at the new japanese restaurant, Ono, in the Gansevoort Hotel, NYC. Delicious creamy mouthfeel with light sweetness. I agree with JoeT that this is one of the better nigoris, and I’ve certainly had my share of the horrible ones. A credit to the style.
Kamoizumi Nigori Ginjo Sake;Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Kamoizumi Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Lots of clustered white clouds, smell of melons, slightly tart, light effervescence, bit of diaper, DELICIOUS, only lightly sweet, great with our summer Japanese meal.

Slater's Premium;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Slater's Ales;"Bottle from Asda, Newark. Deep copper in colour, no head. Little in the way of aroma, and pretty not much more than one dimensional malt on the palate, very little going on here, finish fades very quickly. This is ""premium""? Hmm."

Slater's Premium;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Slater's Ales;Golden in colour with a 1 finger white head. Aroma is minimal but traditional.Has a nice peppery bitterness. But apart from that it is lacking. Maybe deserves a bit better than the score I’m giving it but every category is lacking.
Slater's Premium;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Slater's Ales;This is a nice beer, available in cask and bottle. This review is for the bottled variety. It has a light cereal/hay aroma and amber appearance. Very clean. It is quite lively, although the head doesn't last long... The taste is dry with a lovely equal balance of bitter, sour and salt notes. Fairly light and thin body, but perfectly suited to warm sunny day... I like it a lot - among the best (if not the best) available at Aldi UK.

On Tap! Belgian Double;San Diego, California, United States;Dubbel;On Tap! Bistro & Brewery;Nice rose stained amber with a thin head...Subtle yeast, bubblegum, banana, and grape aromas...Lots of bubblegum yeast flavors, slight tart black grape, solid background bitterness and matching sweetness..I’m not exactly a fan of the yeast they’re using here, but other than that, and the lack of the complexity you’d expect in a authentic belgian dubbel, it seems to be well made.
On Tap! Golden Triangle Triple;San Diego, California, United States;Tripel;On Tap! Bistro & Brewery;"(Draft: O’Brien’s in San Diego, CA) Presumably sampled the same keg as Sick_boy at O’Brien’s on nearly the same night, but I got quite a bit of spicy, moderately sweet aromas from this beer; The flavor was a major let down however, being bitter with a fairly strong and harsh bite in the finish; It was also very spicy and very sweet, but the bitterness is the dominating flavor, and that clearly shouldn’t happen in a tripel; Nothing subtle about this beer; Fairly thick and viscous palate, but the bitter bite just hangs on the palate; Medium gold in color; Off-white head has good size on the pour, and fades to a thin sheen within a few minutes"
On Tap! Golden Triangle Triple;San Diego, California, United States;Tripel;On Tap! Bistro & Brewery;Pours a golden hue with almost no aroma.. no aroma?? yes no aroma....But with a nice head which is supposed to make ups for that??? maybe not.... Flavors of ...... ummm.... I can’t really tell becuase all I go was a slight hop bitterness with almost no flavors other than the yeast.... This is a poor excuse for a belgian triple and I hope this brewery can brew at least one decent beer.
On Tap! Golden Triangle Triple;San Diego, California, United States;Tripel;On Tap! Bistro & Brewery;Crystal clear & golden, distiguished from a bad beer by the slightly darker, cream colored head which displays a nice gallery of lacing throughout your tasting...a spicey yeast aroma finds your nose...tanginess, yeast, & alcohol greet your tongue..bubblegum sweetness follows countered by the signature san diego hopping you’d expect...as with the dubbel, i haven’t founnd myself too excited with the yeast strain..its a tad too assertive and spicey for my taste.

Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood American Wheat Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Carolina Beer Company;"Pours a clean lively straw yellow. Not much in the aroma to talk about. The first sip was ""just another plain beer"", but then the finish stole the show. Something about it has this almost roasted wheat flavor that is really excellent. Not to mention this is refreshing. I am not a huge American Wheat fan. Some come off as way too sweet or cloying. This one, however, hits the spot and makes for a great starter beer or session beer."
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood American Wheat Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Tap. Not nearly as cloudy as the Red Wheat and Blue. Didn’t like this one at all, but wheat is not my cup of tea. Some reason the taste reminded me alot of honey.

Nose of lightly sweet malted wheat with some grainy notes and noble hops. Body starts with about average fullness, but not much malty flavor and a touch of mild tartness and husky character.

The Distillery Raspberry Wheat;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;The Distillery;2003 draught. Light raspberry colored pink with a hint of purple/yellow and a small off white head. Aroma of lightly sharp papery hops, or is that the raspberry? I dont know. It’s hard to discuss the flavor. It’s everything that is wrong with raspberry wheats. Syrupy, fake, excessively and horribly watery, completely devoid of beer flavor. It kinda tastes like seltzer water, with raspberry flavor added.
The Distillery Raspberry Wheat;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;The Distillery;Draft: Pour is red with a faint hint of rasberry in the aroma. Wheat beer in palate and mouthfeel. Not great, but not a drain pour. If you are in Rochester and want a Rasberry wheat, check out custom brewcrafters.
The Distillery Raspberry Wheat;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;The Distillery;[draft - The Distillery - Rochester, NY] Pours a nice reddish color with lots of carbonation and barely any head. Faint raspberry aroma with a touch of wheat and grain. Initial raspberry sweetness in the taste with a watery wheat backbone and a lingering raspberry taste on your lips.
The Distillery Irish Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;The Distillery;Just order the Killians. It tastes much better. This was a poor showing for a brewpub.
The Distillery Irish Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;The Distillery;[draft - The Distillery - Rochester, NY] This one reminds me of Killians, so I would assume that it’s the same style. Anyone in Rochester that’s had it and can correct me, please do. Pours a coppery red color with no head and lots of carbonation. Stale malt aroma with a touch or roasted earthiness. Malt taste with not much of a followup or aftertaste. Kind of bland.
The Distillery Hyland Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Distillery;[draft - The Distillery - Rochester, NY] Pours a nice golden color with a decent sized white head. Good malt aroma to it. Initial malty taste with a watery followup and a good, smooth malt finish.
Wolf In the Hands of the Fans;Besthorpe, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wolf Brewery;Cask@Dartford BF. Tasted like the Will Kemps Ale, well, quite similar anyway. More hops perhaps, earthy hops, bitter finish, nice soft, malty texture.
Wolf In the Hands of the Fans;Besthorpe, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wolf Brewery;Beer #34 at Dartford Beer Festival, with SilkTork and Duff. Mid copper/amber colour. Not for the first time at this festival, there was a whiff of diacetyl butterscotch in the aroma, but that subsided quite quickly, leaving a very decent, easy-drinking, well-balanced session bitter. Cask (gravity dispense).
Wolf In the Hands of the Fans;Besthorpe, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wolf Brewery;Dartford Fest. Gravity. Amber session bitter with bags of fruit and tangy bitterness. Satisfying and very pleasing. Wolf beers are great in the cask but vile in the bottle.
Wolf In the Hands of the Fans;Besthorpe, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wolf Brewery;Bottled. Amber with an annoying uncontrollable foaming beige head. Annoying because I was thirsty and the bloody thing wouldn’t settle to drinking level. Home brew in its flavour and performance.
Faxe Strong Danish Lager;Faxe, Denmark;Malt Liquor;Royal Unibrew;500ml Can Beurk.... not as bad at the 10% Jet fuel. The amber is probably their best one.
Faxe Strong Danish Lager;Faxe, Denmark;Malt Liquor;Royal Unibrew;Gedronken bij dutchdrebus met banzai en joris, blik van een liter, goud helder kleurtje met een stevige schuimlaag. Pilsgeur, smaakt bitter, waterig.
Faxe Strong Danish Lager;Faxe, Denmark;Malt Liquor;Royal Unibrew;Originally rated March 2005. Just like their 10%, pours a golden-yellow light colour with a descent white head, and mild lacing. Looks like a plain lager, and retention is not bad. Says 8.0% on the can. Smells malty with hints of lemon and alcohol. A few spots are releasing carbonation, but that is about it. Watery flat mouthfeel with not much burn. A mild taste of bitterness with some apple aftertaste. No corn compared to the 10%, but still prefered the other one.
Faxe Strong Danish Lager;Faxe, Denmark;Malt Liquor;Royal Unibrew;Canned sample from MLCC. Can’t figure out why the LC would still carry this. Who buys this anyway? Go back to Denmark
Faxe Strong Danish Lager;Faxe, Denmark;Malt Liquor;Royal Unibrew;From the can, this poured a darkish gold with a moderate white head, which left some nice lacing (a small bit). Aroma was mostly malt with something else in the background, fruit perhaps? Taste was a bit of malt and the high ABV was clearly evident. Easy to drink for a strong beer.
Faxe Strong Danish Lager;Faxe, Denmark;Malt Liquor;Royal Unibrew;A clear solid gold colour that appears thick. Dumped out into the glass and produced an OK white head that fades to a ring and looks flat overall. It has a nonoffensive but cheap malt aroma with some alcohol and seems somewhat sharp. The taste is so-so with lots of hard alcohol flavour, decent malts, apple juice and hops. Medium bodied. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth and soft and has a drying malt aftertaste.
Faxe Strong Danish Lager;Faxe, Denmark;Malt Liquor;Royal Unibrew;I love this brew. I know most people do not. Everything from the taste, to the palate to the appearance agrees with me. The only sense that is not as agreeable is the corny alcohol smell. I dunno, maybe its a genetic thing, I have Danish blood so it must be far easier for me to love this stuff than most others. Cheap and effective, cool logo.
Faxe Strong Danish Lager;Faxe, Denmark;Malt Liquor;Royal Unibrew;Holy Christ! A beer so bad Billy Dee Williams wouldn’t star in the ads. An abomination. This is how I imagine a urinal cake must taste. Do even Danish people drink this shit? If so, what did they ever do to deserve such a piss-poor beer, besides exporting some of it. I’ve only taken two sips, and if life weren’t so unbearable sober, I’d pour the rest down the drain. Even then, I don’t think this beer deserves the standard drain pour. I must lobby city council for a special drain for this to go down so it won’t pollute the filth that goes down regular drains. Then a representative clergyman from every recognized religion should be brought in to perform some sort of exorcism over the drain. Then an angry mob must be formed, complete with pitchforks and torches, to fly to Denmark and storm the brewery so no more of this swill can ever be made. If you’re interested in joining the angry mob, please message me through this site re: Angry Mob. Don’t bother buying a pitchfork or torch until you reach Denmark, as I doubt they’ll let us take them on the plane.
Faxe Strong Danish Lager;Faxe, Denmark;Malt Liquor;Royal Unibrew;the feeling of a heavy beer, slightly more unpleasant and mechanical tasting that the extra strong for some reason. alcohol is pretty well hidden though in my opinion. a drinkable, not painful malt liquor
Faxe Strong Danish Lager;Faxe, Denmark;Malt Liquor;Royal Unibrew;Pours out of the 500ml can a pale yellow with a thin white head. Aroma is sweet, floral, some banana, and alcohol. Tastes pretty much the same with a lot of alcohol. Alcohol is not hidden very well.
Harper Hill DosOkies Oildale Pale Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harper Hills, Oildale Winery;why is this categorized as a pale lager? It says pale ale, and it just might be, though it would be the lightest pale ale I’ve ever tasted. It poured disgustingly yellow and smelled of must, hay, and a touch of fruit...tasted extremely light with faint wispers of fruit and grass...the 1st 5 of my six pack were dissapointing, but i saved the last for today whilst i paint my kitchen and I it was surprisingly refreshing. So, my recommendation to you is go in with very low expectations and you will be pleasantly content.
Harper Hill DosOkies Oildale Pale Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harper Hills, Oildale Winery;You almost need sunglasses when pouring this bright yellow beer.

Harper Hill DosOkies Oildale Pale Ale;Bakersfield, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harper Hills, Oildale Winery;Watery, very light, slightly noticable hops, slightly malty finish, thin last creamy head, not horrible, actually not too bad, I guess it’s just not hot enough right now to make this a decent beer.

3 Rivers Oxbow;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;3 Rivers;Pale gold colour. Limited aroma, but what there is is malty, which is rather unexpected given the appearance.

There are some coffee and chocolate flavours here but they are subsumed (at least at first) under a strong fruity taste that brings to mind greengages and gooseberry jam. Very interesting and flavoursome, at a quaffable ABV. Malts rather than hops rule the roost in this brew.

This one, like all others, poured pale yellow body with medium sized bubbly head. Fine aroma, lemon peel, not really artificial. Flavor is good for radler as well, moderately sweet sparkling lemonade with herbal spices and some bready beer, as well. Unfortunately, the aftertaste is really bad, cardboard, maybe of that herbs that went so good in flavor. Except that, I liked this one comparing to many others I’ve tried.
Schloss Radler;Wieselburg, Austria;Radler / Shandy;Wieselburger Brauerei (Brau Union);0.5l can found at a Zielpunkt in Graz, shared with heavy. They must’ve changed the recipe, used to be 45% beer and 55% lemonade and now it says 50/50. Poured a shiny yellow body pierced with large bubbles and carrying a thick white head. The nose seemed surprisingly natural... real notes of lemonade, even slightly herbal. The taste, however reveals its impressive array of sweeteners. Sweet, bready. with what might’ve been proper lemon turned into fakeish lemon drops by the sweeteners in the taste. Herbal once in a while. Bitterish sweetener aftertaste. It’s actually refreshing and not as bad as it might’ve been.

From approximately 100 beers I’ve found only 8 new beers, or should I call them beers, because they were 5 radlers, 1 non alcoholic, and only two regular (Hirter 1270 and Apostelbräu Dinkel).

The Wellhead Cisco Canyon Blonde;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;Draft @ brewpub. Lightly hazed yellow. Super bland aromas and watery palate, the only flavors a smidgen of sweet pale malts. Fruity, in a generic way. Clean enough but boring.

Spicy flavor with some cloying but not in a bad way. Long finish for a blonde ale due to the tettnanger hops. Solid blonde! rerate-tastes pretty much the same, but with more pale malt grain husks. the corn is slightly present, but not too bad. some good citrus notes on the finish.

The Wellhead Pale Ale;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;Arrives from the tap with a 1/4-finger thick, pale tan colored head. The beer is a clear, copper / gold color. Thin, pale malt aromas are the most noticeable thing here, a bit of dried straw, some cracker like malt, and perhaps a soft herbal character is noticeable. The beer has a metallic flavor to it that seems a combination of hops and straw like malt character. There is a soft herbal note as well as a bit of pine like hop character here, and perhaps a touch of citrus character, but this last is quite light. The beer is quite quaffable, but has just a touch of viscosity to it so that it does not seem thin. Not my type of Pale Ale, it seems straight out of the early days of craft beer, where it was thought that Sierra Nevada was way too aggressive of a beer. Not bad, and certainly quaffable.
The Wellhead Pale Ale;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;Golden-bronze colour. Lightly spicy hop aroma. Has some earthy, slightly spicy, slightly earthy taste. Caramel malts lie underneath.
The Wellhead Pale Ale;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;Draft @ brewpub. Copper color, nice hue. Aroma is nicely hopped, very piney. Toasty, woody malts. Earthy and bland but soft and balanced and technically flawless.

The Wellhead Pale Ale;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;Draft at Brewery. Deep Amber color. One or Two tints paler than the Red. Not much head. Aroma was very hard to pick up. Had to swirl the glass and really bury my nose in there to pick up anything. Flavors were better though. The hops came through in the finish and left a bit of ing flavor although a bit soapy.
The Wellhead Pale Ale;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;pours pretty yellow for a pale ale (considering their wheat beer was darker!) Piney aroma with slight citrus notes. flavors are mostly hops and crystal malts. medium piney finish. flavors were just not that bold for a pale ale and the body was a tad thin. Rerate june 2014 Its been 10 yrs since I have been here. Pours bright orange with a nice soapy white head. Nose is classic c hop notes. Grapefruit throughout. Clean ferment with some nice bitterness. Much better than it used to be.
The Wellhead Roughneck Red;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;"The beer arrives from the tap with a tan colored head and a red color, that shows brilliantly clear when held up to the light. The aroma has a faint smell of crystal malt; a bit caramelized, some toasted brown cracker notes, and a soft malty sweetness are all that is really noticeable. The beer has a light sweetness to it, lots of caramelized grain flavors, with chewy brown grain cracker notes, a bit of toasted maltiness, touches of sweet tea, as well as a hint of herbal hop character. This beer is really all about the malt though, it barely has a hop presence. There is a bit of a thin metallic character here as well. The body has a touch of viscosity to it, but this is defintiely a quaffable beer. Again, a beer that seems like it is from the beginnings of the US craft beer industry. Clean and well made, but really not very interesting to me. A great starter craft beer perhaps."
The Wellhead Roughneck Red;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;Slightly hoppy reddish-brown. Dull. caramelly, earthy character, with almost chocolatey notes.
The Wellhead Roughneck Red;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;Draft @ brewpub. Dark, deep auburn. Aroma has integrated diacetyl, buttery, like mixing fresh butter into flour, at the point where no liquid has been added, so not doughy--if that makes sense. Has some buttered toast ends to...But the flavors are doughy and sweet. Brown bread crust. Needs hops to brighten it up! The malts are fine but that’s all there is here. Sweet. Bread and butter beer. 3,6,3,6,10
The Wellhead Roughneck Red;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;[Tap] Pours a clear ruby color with little head.

Pretty dry finish. Their best offering! Good brew. rerate-this time, the stout was the best beer they had. this one was similar, but not as good. some good earthy hop notes (ekg or chinook) with a medium body. a little dull on the flavors and a little to nutty/grainy.
The Wellhead Crude Oil Stout;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;For an out of the way brewery, this is not bad. The aroma was faint with roasted malt. The color was quite dark with a creamy appearance. The palate was light but smooth. The flavors were of roasted malt with some chocolate and a dry finish. I think it needed a little more alcohol though. Decent brew.
The Wellhead Crude Oil Stout;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;"The beer arrives from the tap with a deep brown tinged, dark tan colored head that is maybe a 1/4-finger thick. The beer is a deep black color that has some concentrated brown edges to it. Wow, character, finally, the beer has deep, roasted richness to it with lots of roasted coffee like character, charred black malt, and, as the beer warms up, even a hint of dark malt sweetness up front that leans towards roasted molasses notes towards the middle and finish. The beer is fairly light bodied, and is quite quaffable. Rich roasted, almost smoky leaning notes linger on the palate long after each sip. The finish has bitter hop notes as well as quite a bit of bitter burnt malt character to it. Burnt toast, black cold coffee, and touches of rounded dark chocolate that are just noticeable. Deeply toasted whole grain flavors become a bit more noticeable as the beer warms up; this beer really is served at too cold of a temperature. I hadn’t realized how light this beer was; it is really a beer meant for quaffing, and has a ton more flavor than Guiness does these days. Definitely a tasty beer, and the best I have had so far from this brewery, by far."
The Wellhead Crude Oil Stout;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;Brown, looks flat. The aroma has fudgey notes, and a little bit of roast. Similar mix of roast and malty fudge nuttiness. Decent.
The Wellhead Crude Oil Stout;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;Draft @ brewpub. In sample glass doesn’t look great. No head but scattered ran lace leads me to believe there might be some. Aroma is coffee grounds, in a Folgers direction, not Intelligentsia. Smooth body, nice toasty roast coffee bean flavors, Not bad, just thin.
The Wellhead Crude Oil Stout;Artesia, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Dry;The Wellhead Restaurant and Brewpub;Draft at the brewery. I thought this was pretty decent. Darkest black with a smallish brown head. I was able to make a bigger head later with a bit of swirling. Aromas of chocolate and some coffee. Flavor were very milky with some more chcolate.

Heavy Seas Red Sky At Night;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;"From Jun 2008 I got this bottle from jwc215. Thanks Joe! It pours a hazy straw gold with a 2 finger and growing head of foam. The smell is of candy sugar, yeast, lemon zest, and some clove. Oh, and there is some funk. It wasn't easy to pick up on until after I had several ""holding the glass to my nose"" moments. Overall, the smell insinuated some sourness. The taste has the clove and lemon zest up front followed by notes of candy sugar and yeast, some banana, some pepper, and a slight funk taste. That(the funk) could have a bigger presence and I'd be happier for it but it's still tasty enough to keep me satisfied. Nice lacing and the head retention is quite good. It has a light but pretty nice mouthfeel to it, the carbonation borders on medium, and it finishes with the lemon and funk so, I really like the finish. ;^) Overall, I think this is a pretty good example of the style and I'd be happy if it was available locally. I'm always pleased to try another Saison and this one was tasty. Edit: I forgot to mention. The alcohol is well hidden. I'd have never guessed that this is 8%abv."

OCCASION: watching the Grammys and waiting for more inclement weather... APPEARANCE: cloudy, light yellow body; creamy off-white head settles to a reasonably bubbly half-inch; ... AROMA: instant lemon grass and bubble gum; pepper, clove, and a bevy of hop varietals to tantalize ... PALATE: quite drinkable, with a smooth, rum-like warmth and comfort; the finish is dry but welcoming and lingering...TASTE: a dramatically packed burst of hops that evoke flowers and lemongrass; bubblegum, clove and anise (?) complicate the experience in a good way, with each sip invoking consideration; fruits like pear and apple arrive late in a loaded plate ...OVERALL: this was the beer I took to the 2003 trip to OBX, and all as well until I found a claw (!) in a bottle; still, a fantastic beer for the summer--and, not bad in the months leading up to the spring..."

St. George Summer Ale;Hampton, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;St. George Brewing Company;July 2010. Sampled at the brewery. A lighter version of a pale ale - seem more watery, but I guess for a Summer ale, that is OK, just not my kind of beer.

Smells lightly grassy and ’clean’ and hints of grain that become more prevalent on the flavor. A slight butteriness, but nothing even close to offensive. Mild grassy hoppiness with a pleasant smooth finish. Semi-crisp. Pretty easy drinker. Good replacement for a budlight. Not so good as a pale ale.

Nynäshamns Mörkö Lager;Nynäshamn, Sweden;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Nynäshamns Ångbryggeri;Pours a deep brown beer with an airy light tan head. Roasted and grassy aroma.

Nynäshamns Mörkö Lager;Nynäshamn, Sweden;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Nynäshamns Ångbryggeri;Keg @ Ardbe Room, Stockholm A hard to define beer. Too sweet for a dark lager, not enough burned for a Schwartzbier, not enough hops for... well, any beer. A hint of lactose is also present. If more it might have passed as a milk stout... Knowing the brewers, I m sure the brew will change somewhat in near future. (It’s a very small brewery).
El Toro Peach Flavored Ale;Morgan Hill, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;El Toro Brewing Company;A- Pours a golden hue with a thin head that dissipates quickly. S- Lots of peach, mild yeasty esters. T- Big Peach upfront with a wheaty malt backbone. slightly metallic aftertaste. M- Thin with quite a bit of carbonation
El Toro Peach Flavored Ale;Morgan Hill, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;El Toro Brewing Company;Hazy orange color. Aroma is peach and grainy maly. Flavor is some metalic notes with some bitterness and some peach. Light body. Crisp finish with a wierd lingering metal flavor. Without the metal it would be much better.
El Toro Peach Flavored Ale;Morgan Hill, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;El Toro Brewing Company;Transparent, yellow color. Smell of peach, malt, oranges, strawberies, and some hops. Taste of peaches, honey, hops, light malt, grass and a nice bitterness. I am very surpised how good this goes down. After a little bit more warmong up, I can also taste some pine and orange peal. I got a little of a soapy aftertaste at the end. I will have some more in summer.
El Toro Peach Flavored Ale;Morgan Hill, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;El Toro Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Opened to a loud pssst and poured witha huge off white head. Settled into a medium orange / amber color. Aromas of fresh peaches. Not artificial (as I close my eyes and smell, I can picture holding a fresh peach). I don’t normally like peaches, but I can safely say this one smelled good. Tastes of peaches (not as strong as the aroma). Started out lighlty sweet and ended lightly sour. Thinner body and somewhat over carbonated (as evident with the way it opened).
El Toro Peach Flavored Ale;Morgan Hill, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;El Toro Brewing Company;Not too sweet like most belgian ales using lots of fruit. Wonderfully dry, bitter, hopped pale ale with peach flavor that is just right balance-- strong but not overwhelming the pale ale taste. Maybe the pits and skin give it that nice bitterness. Drink this one chilled. Frothy head. Can quench thirst but also as a sipper. Sometimes the first chilly smell and sip gives me a pleasant fleeting head rush that is hard to describe. Great change of pace. Classic lawnmowing brew. Perhaps too much carbonation. Brenan chain in Wisconsin may be only place to get it.
El Toro Peach Flavored Ale;Morgan Hill, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;El Toro Brewing Company;Mostly translucent and fiery gold in color with a foamy, tight-packed tan head. Peach juice squeezed from the can leaps at the sinuses, pursued by dried apricot pieces that bring me back to toddler years, along with some sugary nectarine juice with peach jolly ranchers slowly diffusing. Peaches (imagine that) emasculate the flavor as expected, yet they inhibit a husky quality, spiffed by a curt bitter element that’s immediately pinned to the roof of the mouth. Substantive cohabitation is completely comprised of a musky pils quality. Peaches wrapped in tamale husks and faded grass stains curtail on the coattails. The formula works, save the hop profile, but it’s best to not throw caution in the wind and leave this within a child’s arm reach.
El Toro Peach Flavored Ale;Morgan Hill, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;El Toro Brewing Company;Bottle purchased at Brennan’s. Cloudy wit-like yellow body with a big fluffly white head. Smells just like ripe peaches with a touch of mandarin orange tartness thrown in. Good flavor - lightly malted blonde ale base with the less-sweet elements of peach on top - skin and the woody pit. I’m sure there weren’t any pits in their peach extract but that’s what I taste. I appreciate how it’s not overly-sweet which makes for a refreshing, crisp beer. Nice job!
El Toro Peach Flavored Ale;Morgan Hill, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;El Toro Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. What a surprise that I’m only the third reviewer of this Cali beer, and the other two are in Wisconsin! Immense fluffy, bubbly white head topping an almost clear peach-juice body....very fresh, fruity nose with hints of biscuit underneath and a mild grassiness, clean and nice...the body is quite interesting, sweet peachy juice interacting with a fair amount of strong sprucy hoppiness, very zesty towards the finish, touch of dryness in the center really crushes the potentially syrupy fruitiness at the finish...solid medium-full body. Not incredibly complex, but vastly better than the average in the style, with no real faults.
El Toro Peach Flavored Ale;Morgan Hill, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;El Toro Brewing Company;Here’s a surprise! Not just an insipid American wheat flavored with extract, as I’ve come to expect. This is actually a reasonably hopped pale ale with a nice sweet and slightly tart peach fuitiness. Very perfumey peach aroma. I might actually buy this again! The single I bought this time around gushed, but was not infected. Lightly sedimented.
El Toro Peach Flavored Ale;Morgan Hill, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;El Toro Brewing Company;Near amber color with a moderate cream colored head. Initial sweet peach aroma frightens me. I continue and find hops swimming with these peaches in a mild malt sea. Quite pleasant. Actually a dry start with a light toffee and caramel sweetness coupled with a mild floral hops flavor. Finish has a mild peach flavor with a light peach pit bite. Actually much better than I expected.
Åbro Bryggmästarens Mörka Lager 3.5%;Vimmerby, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Åbro Bryggeri;Brun med ett vitt skum. En lätt historia med lite mer malt än blask lager. Lite av allt ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Åbro Bryggmästarens Mörka Lager 3.5%;Vimmerby, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Åbro Bryggeri;Lovely maroon beer foaming nice. It has a very light fragrance that sporadically hit the nose and quickly disappears. However, you can reach to glimpse some malt tones and a slight hoppy aroma. The taste is initially characterized by a malt sweetness that quickly assumes a hoppy flavor which in turn quickly turn into a somewhat water to taste with leftover of hop bitterness that in no way surprising. Palate can be in a small place, and as a whole has no character. However, it is drinkable and good as a thirst quencher, but unfortunately without any real identity.
Åbro Bryggmästarens Mörka Lager 3.5%;Vimmerby, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Åbro Bryggeri;This was a nice beer to come from Åbro. Quite malty taste with a little coffee in the aftertaste.

Åbro Bryggmästarens Mörka Lager 3.5%;Vimmerby, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Åbro Bryggeri;Dieses schwedische alkoholreduzierte Lager ist im Ganzen etwas laff.

Åbro Bryggmästarens Mörka Lager 3.5%;Vimmerby, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Åbro Bryggeri;Det var det här man befarade skulle hända. Det är skopa av sin egen kritik mot 3,5-procentig öl i största allmänhet som man får nedtryckt i halsen på grund av Åbros mörka lager. Det är bara att erkänna, motvilligt, att den är fullt godkänd.

Åbro Bryggmästarens Mörka Lager 3.5%;Vimmerby, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Åbro Bryggeri;Bottle from NK Saluhall, May 2013. (labeled as Premium Dark) Copper with a large head. Obviously thin but still quite drinkable. Bread, malt, caramel and some light notes of fruit. The finish was sweet.
Åbro Bryggmästarens Mörka Lager 3.5%;Vimmerby, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Åbro Bryggeri;A very good according to me. Decent with smell but good smell anyway. The taste is good and just right. The aftertaste is good and there is a moment. This beer does not promise so much but just enough to drink. Perfectly okay to drink beer.
Åbro Bryggmästarens Mörka Lager 3.5%;Vimmerby, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Åbro Bryggeri;500 ml bottle, labelled Bryggmästarens Premium Dark 3,5%. Aroma of dark malt and bread, kind of spicy. Taste is a bit tangy and basementy, dark malts and sour bread. Not very pleasant.
Grainstore Bartons Mild;Oakham, Rutland, England;Mild Ale;Grainstore Brewery (Rutland Brewing Co.);"Appearance is ""Dark beers look better"" (sometimes).

Harviestoun Dragonfly;Alva, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;On cask. Pale golden colour, aroma of fruity resin, some hops, taste is more of the same, citrus, quite dry, refreshing. Quite tasty and packing a decent amount of flavour. Not bad.
Harviestoun Dragonfly;Alva, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;Cask @ The Sir John Moore JDW. Golden yellow colour, good head. Fruity resin aroma. Citrusfruit & resin flavour. Dry aftertaste.Light & refreshing blonde beer. Big taste for a 3.6% beer.
Harviestoun Dragonfly;Alva, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;Pretty basic beer, thin malt base to a fairly standard hop profile which is a little resiny. Watery and lacking depth. A pretty bog standard session ale, surprisingly dull for Harviestoun who usually add a little something to beers. So overall a bit pedestrian.
Harviestoun Dragonfly;Alva, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;Cask@Hope & Anchor, Bristol. Golden colour, small head. Aroma is fruity, floral, mild herbal and nectary notes. Flavour is quite similar in a nice balance. Refreshing, but a bit boring.
Harviestoun Dragonfly;Alva, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;Cask by handpump at Queens Arms, Edinburgh - clear golden ale, good white head, citrus hop aroma and flavour, thin body, dry bitter citrus finish
Harviestoun Dragonfly;Alva, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;First tasted this in the Saltcot, Saltcoats (JDW) in May 2004. Cask, handpump dispense. Crystal clear pale straw in colour with a thin white head. Hint of lemon grass in the short aroma. Thin watery mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a weak malt base with just a hint of lemon and lime cordial in there. Floral hops give a fragrant flavour to the short aftertaste. Finish is very light and watery with hop resins just about edging it. Yet another Golden Ale to add to the burgeoning biased portfolio. No wonder Brewdog is so popular just now
Harviestoun Dragonfly;Alva, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;Cask at the Red Lion, Isleworth, Bank Holiday Festival, 29th August 2010. Straw gold colour.

Harviestoun Dragonfly;Alva, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;13th July 2010. Chelmsford Beer Festival. Clear gold beer. Little white head. Light semi dry palate. Good grapefruit - orange hops for it’s abv. Fruity bitter - not much else but tastes alright with consideration to it’s low strength.
Harviestoun Dragonfly;Alva, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harviestoun Brewery;Pale pint, citrus, lemon and dry flavours, quite fruity overall and a decent hoppy finish. Nice and refreshing.

Poured with a huge lasting, frothy and doming off-white head atop a golden orange body. Crisp lemon and grassy hops with some sweet peach and orange. A lovely grapefruit citrus quality about the flavour that lasted well, complimented by sweet tangerine notes. Bright & refreshing yet soft palate texture, light to medium body and a lingering bitter hop finish. Another good Harviestoun golden.

Dark golden in colour with small barely noticeable white head. Found this to be a really refreshing summer beer, kept in superb condition and served at just the right temperature, nice maltiness and good level of bitterness little bit sweet but not unduly so. I was convinced this said 3.6% or 3.8% on the pump clip but it definately said Tom Woods summer (summat) and a quick check on their website confirms this as their seasonal beer, although this didn’t taste or look like a lager style beer.

It’s clean and fairly dry, with some pale malt and a touch of citrus, but I am not really enamoured of these lager style summer ales. I prefer something with a bit more crisp, hoppy bite.

Elm City Belgian Witbier;Keene, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Elm City Brewing Co.;Hazy golden in color with a small white head.. Fruity,spicy aroma. Flavor has a sharp wheat tang,sweet and tart with a fruity/spicy finish.
Elm City Old Castle;Keene, New Hampshire, United States;Brown Ale;Elm City Brewing Co.;A Nut Brown, very similar to Newcastle according to the waitress. Not really. My fist reaction to the flavor was that it was too sweet with not much else going on. After a few more sips it still had that initial sweet bite but turned quite bland and almost watery. Appearance was dark brown topped with a small head. Not much lacing on the glass. Not much aroma either, especially for something that should be quite flavorful. The beer was merely average and rather bland all around. I’ve found that most of the beers at this place are in the average range.

Elm City Maibock;Keene, New Hampshire, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Elm City Brewing Co.;My Bottom Line: Well-rounded honeyed cereals and whispering herbal hops conjure up and very drinkable, clean pint of Heller Bock. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam floats atop the deep golden. -The finish is a simple fading out of the flavor profile, with not much bitterness. -Balance is nearly achieved throughout. -The mouthfeel is quite comfortable, cushiony and softly carbonated.

A great balance. It’s almost too smooth, but very enjoyable, especially for a warm day! One of the best beers I’ve had at the Elm City Brewing Co."""

Elm City Lunch Pale Ale;Keene, New Hampshire, United States;Pale Ale - English;Elm City Brewing Co.;This is a decent Pale Ale I just tried at my local brewpub. Not sure who or how they come up with some of their names though. This beer pours a somewhat cloudy copper body topped with a medium white foamy head. The head diminishes quickly and there’s only a little bit of lace on the glass halfway through the beer. Aroma is slightly sweet with hops and maybe a little grassy. It tasted sweet and slightly hoppy but not as hoppy as I would have liked. The finish was sweet and a little bland leaving me wanting more. It felt sort of watery but not at all a bad beer. Compared to the others I’ve had here it’s actually one of the best. A little more flavor and it would have been great!

Elm City Pothole Porter;Keene, New Hampshire, United States;Porter;Elm City Brewing Co.;"When I first had this beer I actually liked it, prompting me to buy a ""growler"" of it. When it was all said and done it really wasn’t a very good beer. Very dark in color, but didn’t taste as dark and poured a small amount of head. Had almost a flat, bitter taste to it. Like old flat coke with an alcohol kick, it looked like Coke too without the fizz. Something I probably won’t get again, but you never know with these microbrews, they sometimes taste completely different each time."

Bright, sparkling medium gold with a tight, compact snow-white crown that holds firm with good legs. Soft, bready and yeasty nose with hints of chamomile, tea and flower petals. Nice, delicate malty palate, weet-bix, toasted grain, hay. Very light, clean, a little citrus on the tail before a lightly bitter, dusty swallow. Quite dry, a mild spritz amplifies it somewhat. Drops off quick, no aftertaste. Very simple, a nice easy quaffer.
Beer Engine Rail Ale;Exeter, Devon, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Beer Engine;On gravity at the Tuckers Maltings Beer festival, Newton Abbot 23/04/10. Amber coloured with a slight, off-white head.

Beer Engine Rail Ale;Exeter, Devon, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Beer Engine;Beer # 13 at Dartford Beer Festival with SilkTork and Duff. A gold coloured standard bitter. The aroma has a hint of malt, but nothing very assertive. The flavour, again has a little malt and a little bitterness, but, again, not a lot of impact. Dry finish, but not a lot of crisp bite. A perfectly reasonable session beer, but nothing get too excited about. Although the marks are relatively low, this beer is entirely fit for the purpose intended. Cask (gravity dispense).

Beer Engine Piston Bitter;Exeter, Devon, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Beer Engine;500ml brown bottle with a comical label of a train loaded with brewing equipment. 4.2%. The label also says it was brewed and bottled for ’The Beer Engine’, but not by who and where. Best by Nov 2007, drank in Dec 2006. Tawny brown, clean looking in my sleeved pint glass, very thin white wispy head sat on top, loads of bubbled rising through the beer,they are not however helping the head to grow or stay. Aroma, caramel, but not sweet or toffee apple, hops and a splash of malt also in the air. Very dry, too dry for my tastebuds. the dryness is there from the first sip until the last and lingers in the mouth. I have two more bottles in the garage, they will now move from my personal stash, to the ’visitors allowed to drink them’ area. Not a bad beer by any standard, but just a bit dry for me.
Beer Engine Piston Bitter;Exeter, Devon, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Beer Engine;Cask, handpump @ The Beer Engine, Newton St. Cyres, Devon. Didn’t seem in top form when I tried this one. Or maybe it was me!? Deep tawny amber and bright as bright with a depleting white fluff atop. Yeasty, sulphury and oddly phenolic, plastic and burnt matchstick nose with just a hint of grass, toffee and earth. The aroma is very shortlived like the head. First mouthful has a lot of burnt nastiness, phenolic and husky, astringent and bitter malt more than hop in back. Very earthy and musty in the swallow. Settles out to reveal some burnt wood and old staling rye bread on the mid-palate. The body is light, even thin and slightly oily, soft and still. It seems to get better the more I drank, but that seems normal as alcohol kicks in. Unimpressive as it is, but given prior ratings its justifiably a dud batch. Bummer as it’s possibly my last visit!

Ruddy tinged tawny chestnut in colour, not quite bright but has an oily shimmer when held to the light. A houdini head, now you see it now you don’t, settles to but an island of white atop. Mixed bag on the aroma; caramel, burnt sugar, bitter, dried fruit peel mix, old staling port wine and sweetened, dried prunes and dates. Good body, big, rounded and smooth on the palate. Lots of chewy sweet malt and bitter dried fruits like raisins, sultanas and prunes. A tangy edge of orange marmalade, sweet and sharp, before a swallow reminiscent of fruit mince pies. Lingers long on the palate. Has a dusty edge that balances out its sugary side, and a seemingly warming effect although it’s not a potent brew. This is a lovely bitter, full of life, full of flavour and not too heavy. Easily their best, but not the most sessionable. A few pints of these is more than enough."

Fairly weighty in alcohol terms for a UK bitter but drinks easily enough. Very well judged balance of chewy malt and tangy, spicy hops, although the aroma is quite subtle and restrained.

Badgers Hill Farm Pippin Cider - Dry (Draught);Canterbury, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Badgers Hill Farm & Cidery;Badgers Hill is a garden centre / orchard in Chilham, a small village between Canterbury and Ashford in Kent. My folks happen to live in Chilham, so I think its my duty to be the first reviewer of their cider. Its sold from the barrel in 2 pint milk cartons at £4.25. In the glass its very pale, with very little carbonation. It’s 8% abv, and this is well disguised. The taste is of apples and a slight peachyness. Quite sweet, mellowing out in the finish. Its a young cider and lacks body - it could do with a ageing before its sold. That said its very fruity and refreshing and I’ll be buying it again. They also do a sweet and a medium dry. The shop is open every day between March and September.
Moa Methode Pilsner;Marlborough, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Moa Brewing Company;This is a backlog rating from 2009 from a bottle at a tasting, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time, work and/or family. Words to describe this beer are pilsner malts, citrusy, grass, floral.
Moa Methode Pilsner;Marlborough, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Moa Brewing Company;"Golden colour, slightly hazy with slight fruit notes. Spicy to the taste but very pleasant; good mouth feel."
Moa Methode Pilsner;Marlborough, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Moa Brewing Company;330ml bottle at the Beer Bank, Kuala Lumpur. Poured a hazy golden colour with a lasting frothy white head. The aroma is Pilsner malt, hay, some light citrus, woody hop. The flavour is moderate bitter with a light, crisp, malt, dry woody hop bitter palate and a lingering bitter finish. A decent and rather inoffensive Pilsner. Fine for a session if this floats your boat. Comparable with some of the better European Pilsners.
Moa Methode Pilsner;Marlborough, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Moa Brewing Company;Pours cloudy dark golden, with a full, off-white head. Aroma is hay, light caramel and some hops. Taste is light caramel with hint of clove, moving to breadiness and a building hop backbone. Finish is hoppy. A decent pils.

Moa Methode Pilsner;Marlborough, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Moa Brewing Company;Keg at Moa Tiki, Singapore. Clear pale golden, small head. Aroma of papaya and citrus. Mid dry with light-medium body and crisp, rounded, spritzy mouthfeel. White currant and spices, mild citrus. Long bitter finish. Nowhere near a pilsner, but a great hoppy quaffable modern lager hybrid.
Moa Methode Pilsner;Marlborough, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Moa Brewing Company;Moa Methode Pilsner pours hazy pale golden with a medium-sized frothy head with some lacing. The nose has notes of citrus, apricot, and bright tropical fruits with a hint of caramel. While it is mildly bready up front, the bitterness kicks in in the mid-palate along with the bright fruit notes and some earthiness and peppery spiciness. It transitions into the slightly resiny, yeasty dry finish smoothly while the bitterness intensifies. Despite its name, this brew is not a pilsner - the carbonation is too fine, the body is too full, the hops are non-noble, and the finish isn’t clean enough to give you the snappy pils feel.
Moa Methode Pilsner;Marlborough, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Moa Brewing Company;Bottle pours a clear pale golden yellow with a huge white head. Spicy citrus aroma bordering on Belgian yeast esters like a Belgian blond. Taste of dry citrus hop with a light spice, light grassy hops, dry malt, with Belgian yeast esters. Few to no pilsners qualities, closer to a Belgian blond or Belgian pale ale.
Moa Methode Pilsner;Marlborough, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Moa Brewing Company;This was served as a palate cleanser after some pretty headstrong fresh hopped IPAs and a 16% imperial stout. Hardly surprising that it stacked up like a dandelion in a hurricane. It did cleanse the palate, I guess, but was entirely forgettable.
Moa Methode Pilsner;Marlborough, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Moa Brewing Company;On tap at Moa. Biscuit, tart lemon, floral. Quite cloying, pretty much the opposite of crisp. Not great.

I found this to be very sweet (supposed to be dry!) admittedly there was a slight dryness towards the end. I cannot get away from a sacchriney artificial sweetness unfortunately, tastes powdery in the mouth, not my thing apples are very much bit players here, and yet I’m almost on my own with my views (poured the last third away) this stuff appears to be very popular.

Biddenden Special Reserve Cider (Bottle);Ashford, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Biddenden Vineyards;Bottle picked up at Biddenden, consumed to bring in the New Year. It pours clear deep amber with pretty much no head. The nose is rich, plenty of sweet apple, oily, touch of wood and whisky. The taste is smooth, juicy, unctuous apple, candied pear, oily, wood and some whisky in the background. Not actually as much whisky character as I was expecting. Good depth and drinks incredibly smoothly. Has a bit of ice-cider about it. A great sipper.
Biddenden Special Reserve Cider (Bottle);Ashford, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Biddenden Vineyards;Glass from a bottle at The cherry Tree Canterbury shared with Ang. Bright gold with no head. Some apple on the aroma. Quite sticky. Quite hot in moith. Some subtle whisky jotes. More like a grain whisky cask. Quite sweet and sticky. Finish has sweetish apples. But not unpleasant. Highland whisky orange notes. Quite impressive for the kick 3.5 bottle at The New Inn Canterbury. Clear amber colour no head. Eating apple aroma some caramelised apple. Remarkably smooth. Just a hint of heat on the finish. Wow. Sweetish apple. Like a caramelised apple tart. Pretty sweet. Rather good. Way too sweet. Worth it though.
Biddenden Special Reserve Cider (Bottle);Ashford, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Biddenden Vineyards;I was quite surprised about this one. Dark orange coloured. It has an extremely woody character. Aroma is wood and leather. Strong and round finish. Woody aftertaste.

Biddenden Special Reserve Cider (Bottle);Ashford, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Biddenden Vineyards;"(Bottle) Clear amber, no head and quite flat.Fantastic and very intense aroma of whisky and fruit.

Biddenden Special Reserve Cider (Bottle);Ashford, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Biddenden Vineyards;Bottle. Orange colour with no head. Fruity, whisky, alcohol aroma and a sweet fruity, whisky taste. Medium body with a sweet warming alcoholic finish. Cider is not my strong side, but this one is ok.
Biddenden Special Reserve Cider (Bottle);Ashford, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Biddenden Vineyards;This cider caught me by surprise - inspite of knowing that it at matured in whisky cask - I had no idea, that the aroma would be so powerful and only of whisky - I imagined some apples in the aroma, but only whisky, so I was kicked back in the chair overwhelmed and not too satisfied - eventhough the whisky aroma is nice (for a whisky). The color is a dark orange and no surprise it has no head. The flavor is much more complex, than the aroma, since it has a really interesting combination of notes from the apples and the whisky, with some acidity from the apples as well as some woody notes from the cask, and a dry end. I would have like if the same combination of apples and whisky that is present in the flavor also was present in the aroma.
Biddenden Special Reserve Cider (Bottle);Ashford, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Biddenden Vineyards;This is a dark fuity cider, it fully packs 13% not a great spiritousness in it, but it tases wonderful. About £7 a wine bottle
Biddenden Special Reserve Cider (Bottle);Ashford, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Biddenden Vineyards;This is a monster of a cider, but it does not taste like it. Apple is present slightly in the arome but more predominantly in the flavour, it does not taste like 5% let alone 13%, there is whisky on the nose (it is whisky casked) but this is not so apparent in the mouth. Give it a try but beware it is strong and expensive.

Aroma is surprisingly strong: some fruits with peppery and spicy tone. Flavor starts with sweet fruits, ends with peppery hops and some alcohol coming up.

The Original HY Super Beer (HΨ);Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Una bellissima bottiglia fa immaginare una grande birra. In realtà è una buona strong Ale con lieviti belgi che danno note di frutta a pasta gialla: albicocca e ananas. Al palato è abbastanza esile con un malto caramello e miele molto pronunciati.

Teme Valley Dark Stranger;Knightwick, Worcestershire, England;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Teme Valley Brewery;Cask conditioned GBBF 2005: Horrible. Tastes slighty rodden. I could’nt really taste the wheat, and that is maybe a shame. Nothing for me.
Teme Valley Dark Stranger;Knightwick, Worcestershire, England;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Teme Valley Brewery;Cask, GBBF, August 2005 (Day 2). A curious beer. Mid brown colour. Like others, I wouldn’t have guessed this is a wheat beer. But that tends to be the norm for British wheat beers. I think the level of wheat in the grain bill at which British brewers describe their beers as wheat beers is rather low. It has treacle toffee, soft chocolate and licorice notes. Also spicy and herbal nuances. But its also dry and fairly bitter. Unusual but somehow it works.
Teme Valley Dark Stranger;Knightwick, Worcestershire, England;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Teme Valley Brewery;GBBF, 2005: Lonely dusky flavours. A maiden on horseback. A rolling lightbulb on the plains of Araby. Roasty. And very nice.

Teme Valley Dark Stranger;Knightwick, Worcestershire, England;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Teme Valley Brewery;Cask (GBBF): Dark copper with a brown head. Lacks aroma. Loads of cara/choc in the flavour, with a mildly fruity finish. Medium bodied, ok.
Teme Valley Dark Stranger;Knightwick, Worcestershire, England;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Teme Valley Brewery;On tap at GBBF 05. Brown beer, with a loose, pond-like head. Standard Bitter: dry with a pepper finish. Not terribly interesting, but it is bitter (with a small ’B’) as intended.
Teme Valley Dark Stranger;Knightwick, Worcestershire, England;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Teme Valley Brewery;Cask @ GBBF 2005: Quite a surprise. A british dunkelweizen??? Well, nevertheless. Burgundy coloured. Has distinct cocoa notes, is floral and herbal. Miss most of the normal weizen flavours IMO. Is quite dry and fruity bitter in the end. As Hbie I would have called it a Mild.

Teme Valley Talbot Porter;Knightwick, Worcestershire, England;Porter;Teme Valley Brewery;Half pint at Charlies. Pours deep orange and golden with a little off-white head. Flavour is mild fruity hops, mild caramel malt base. Nice lingering hoppy and light fruity finish. Porter? Not in my book.

Abraham Thompson Lickerish Stout;Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England;Stout;Abraham Thompson;Cask, Carlisle BF, 6 Oct 2011. This version came out at 3.8%. A huge combination of coffee, chocolate and licquorice, but nothing overpowers and everything is beautifully in balance. Black as pitch, bags of flavour and extremely impressive for such a low ABV.

Sheppy's Tremlett's Bitter Cider (Bottle);Taunton, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Sheppy's Cider;Bottle, glorious golden coloured cider, that is wonderfully refreshing with a great appley and woody aroma and a taste of wood in this pleasantly medium/dry but erring more towards dry cider, very nice indeed.
Sheppy's Tremlett's Bitter Cider (Bottle);Taunton, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Sheppy's Cider;500 ml bottle courtesy of geth_in_beer. Thanks again. (I’m only now realizing how many beer you dragged over for me). Orange-golden colour. Beautiful earthy/dusty aroma over a sweet appley aroma. Distinct apple skin tannins in the nose as well. As it warms a beautiful fragrant floral character comes from underneath the tart acidity and soft funkiness. Lightly stinky cheesy funkiness over the more normal horsey character and wild yeastiness. Some soft vanilla notes and a very dry tannic finish make this go down very easily. As it warms, the sweetness comes forth a bit more, but it is still very dry. Lovely cider.
Sheppy's Taylor's Gold Cider (Bottle);Taunton, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Sheppy's Cider;0.5 l bottle from local 'Getränke Hoffmann', apparently bottled in November 2018. Clear, very pale golden with a thin, fluffy, quickly diminishing, white layer. Sweetish, a little sourish, gently fruity and minimally funky aroma of sweet apples, light wood and hints of funk. Gently sweet, slightly sour, quite fruity taste of sweet apples, a touch of wood and traces of honey, followed by a short, slightly tart, quite dry finish. Thin to medium body, slightly astringent and gently effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Very refreshing and deep for a medium-sweet cider, fairly well-balanced and highly quaffable. Pretty good and also pretty surprising to find this kind of cider at my local former 'Dursty'.

Dry, mineral nose, green apple and funk, barnyard, band-aid. Medium sweet, as predicted. Some bandaid is not so pleasant, otherwise sweet apple, minerals, some hay-like funkiness. Interesting stuff. Strange phenolic character has to go though. Light carbonation and silky body is nice.
Sheppy's Taylor's Gold Cider (Bottle);Taunton, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Sheppy's Cider;Bottle from Booths. Pours golden. The taste is sweet stewed apples at first with a little sherbet and a touch of farmyard. Lingering sugary finish. Refreshing and pleasant easy drinking sweet cider.

Sheppy's Kingston Black Cider (Bottle);Taunton, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Sheppy's Cider;Bottle at Full Monty. Very dry, tannic nose. Chalk, minerals, just a bit of apple. This is the driest cider I have ever had, extremely tannic, with just a hint of light, sweet apple juice somewhere in there that makes it very fun and enjoyable. The tannic finish last a long, mouth-puckering time. I actually liked this a lot, beyond the educational value of a single KB cider. It is too dry to drink all day, and I enjoyed the Vintage Reserve much more, but a fascinating creature.

Sheppy's Oakwood Special Cider (Bottle);Taunton, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Sheppy's Cider;Bottle from Vinmonopolet in Valkendorfsgate, Bergen. Pours a pale orange body with a medium carbonation level. I’ve learned by now that ciders aren’t supposed to have a head, but can’t help commenting the CO2 in some way. :-P Nose is tart, dry apples and wood. Taste is very dry, with strong oak notes coming in along with a slightly tart, dry and short - but still fresh, as opposed to mature - apple flavor. Highly drinkable, although perhaps a tiny bit too dry for my liking. All in all: not too bad, but no memorable cider either.

Rock Bottom Milwaukee American Dream IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;Pours orange with white head, aroma is nice citrus hop in the forefront, a bit of biscuit as well. Really hop bursted this beer, with big hop character in the beginning, sweet caramel in the middle, but not bitter on the finish. Good and the best of the ones I tried, but still lacking.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee American Dream IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;On tap at Rock Bottom - Milwaukee. Poured reddish-orange with a nice cap of whitish head. The aroma picked up juicy redder fruits and a hint of floral over dry caramel. The flavor found fruits and caramel again at the core, but it lost some of the juiciness and became a little muddled.. moderately bitter with black pepper and fruit leading.. finished somewhat quickly. Medium-bodied and dry overall on the palate.. didn’t roll through the mouth as well as I would have liked.. still a solid drinker.

Rock Bottom Milwaukee American Dream IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;This is good for an IPA -- and I agree with BeerBelcher, it’s much drier and bitter than citrusy and sweet. Drinkable, I drank a few after trying some inferior RB products off tap at the RB Milwaukee. Aroma doesn’t match the taste, though. Still pretty good.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee American Dream IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;"It seems to me that very hoppy IPAs/APAs/DIPAs in the midwest are very citrusy or sweet, while those in the west are drier and more purely bitter. If you accept this, I would say that this IPA is more like a ""west coast"" IPA, with a lot of hop bitterness without a lot of sweetness. It is very dry with a lot IBUs. Appearance is good...it is a rather golden IPA with a good amount of head. A lot of citrus aroma, but very little citrus flavor. It is boldly bitter but without a lot of balance. For as much bitterness as this beer has, I didn’t think the mouthfeel was very sticky. It was fairly drinkable. I’d order this again, but I was a bit disappointed and felt that the aroma made a promise unkept by the taste."

Rock Bottom Milwaukee American Dream IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;Foamy white head with an oddly dark color for an IPA. Aroma has traces of flora and malt. The taste was different. It was an odd mix of hops with touches of malt. It struck me as very bitter and dry. 8% ABV?! Good grief, didn’t seem that high at all. It was pretty good, an unexpectedly nice find, but not one to write home about.

Pitfield Bitter;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);Bottle at the Juniper Tree NW3. Amber brown colour, slight haxe. Thin white foam. Hmmm not that impressed with this, haven’t had a Pitfield beer in ages and remember the organic stuff always being pretty uninspiring and that doesn’t seem to have changed. Lack of definition in malts, not much hop and tastes like they used Greene King house yeast so an overarching hint of dishwater. All they need to do now is serve it warm from an old oxidated cask...not helpful for bitter as a style or organic beer as a thing this.

McCoys Belgian Abbey Dubbel;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Dubbel;McCoy's Public House;Served in a hurricane glass which I thought was odd. I took a lot of crap from my buddies for that. Black pepper and brown sugar come through well in the nose. Soft malts also. Cloudy orange color which I don’t really think is right for style. Thick foamy head with lots of lace. Notes of pepper, orange/lemon, and sugar in each drink. Valvety smooth with subtle carbonation. Not a bad whack at a Belgian. I would get it again.
McCoys Belgian Abbey Dubbel;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Dubbel;McCoy's Public House;Served appropriately in a stemmed tulip glass, but when ordering this, count on 20-30 mins. time for the beer to warm sufficiently prior to consumption. Aroma is full of malt and yeast, dark breadiness and light brown sugar sweetness blending with prominent banana and melon fruitiness, toffee, spicy notes and a certain floral sweetness. Light-medium amber-brown color, pale for the style and filtered with a slight but lasting head. Flavor profile is mildly complex -- malty, sweet, estery and lightly tangy with the sugary and toffeeish malt up front followed by a rush of fruitiness and a lively, lightly acidic, long and mildly warming finish. Pleasant interplay of malt sweetness and fruity yeast, some very faint citrusy notes to be found inbetween. Body is medium-full, mouthfeel is round and smooth. Certainly a pleasant surprise and a very good beer.
Goose Island 16 Year ESB;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at Clybourn brew pub. Deep amber, almost ruby color. I didn’t get much of a smell. The taste was an expansive, almost fruity sweetness that felt palpable in the mouth, transitioning to a nice dry bitter in the finish. The contrast between the volume and refreshing flavor of the beer at first with the dry absense of anything but lingering bitter was nice, and it was the best Goose Island beer I’ve had in a while, definitely best of the night.

The taste is malty but there is a sharp, balancing hop bitterness in the finish. This beer maturely expresses the Fuggle hop character; earthy, spicy, and subtly fruity. Overall this has a good mellow flavor to it, though there is a bit too much astringency in the finish."
Goose Island 16 Year ESB;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Clear ruby body with thick, persistent tan head. Really pleasant, subtle fruity nose of peaches, apricot, toffee, nuts, lightly bitter hops and whole grain bread. Really elegant body with soft, creamy carbonation. The flavor is just as nice as the nose but with a little more sweetness. Fruity with caramel, molasses, nuts, grains and I’m sure many more things. the finish is smooth and refreshing and leaves your tongue wanting more. Another fine session ale.
Goose Island 16 Year ESB;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Lots of carbonation. Creamy head. Ruby hue. Hazy. Creamy mouthfeel. Not as bitter as I was expecting or hoping.
Goose Island 16 Year ESB;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Dark copper, nice pillowy off-white head (may have been nitroed). Grassy hops in the nose, with some metallic and caramel notes. Medium sweet in flavor, with a nice bitter, grassy hop kick. Just a touch of diacetyl, which was pleasant. Slight metallic tang detracts a bit from the taste. Very smooth mouthfeel, very much a session beer.
Harmon Brown's Point ESB;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;Poured into a mug, the appearance was a semi-transparent amber color with a thin cap of a white foamy head. A disarray of light lace. The aroma had some sweet grassy to earthy hoppy tones. Some malts, somewhat tea-like and lean. Light dose of biscuity to breadiness. The flavor leaned crisp and malty sweet with a touch of the smooth tea and earthiness. This all combines into the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, nicely done ESB well worthy of having again, preferably with some fish n’chips.
Harmon Brown's Point ESB;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;Bottled: unk Pours a copper, diaphanous ale with a sheet of off white foam. Light molasses and tea like malts with a hint of earthy hops on the nose - pretty spot on for ESB IMO. The malts are a little oxidized, but not off setting. There is a good herbal quality to the hops and a slight plastic and sharpness to the malt - almost as though the mash was an overnight mash. Body is medium on full and carb is hi as anticipated with a semi dry finish. This is a decent ESB. I always forget how exceptionally forgettable ESB’s are and that the most beautiful thing about them is their subtly, like 007. Serving type: bottle 03-16-2012
Harmon Brown's Point ESB;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;On tap at London pub. Hazy orange with bubbly cap. Seems to retain and lace decently. Aroma of honey, cereal, soggy leaves. Taste is malty, with a good hop presence. Medium to light body and carbonation.
Harmon Brown's Point ESB;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;Deep copper-amber coloured brew. Fairly assertive crystal malt sweetness with a lightly woody bitterness. A little bit of diacetyl in here as well. Could definitely do with some cleaner yeast here. The hops are actually quite lovely in here.

Harmon Brown's Point ESB;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;Bottle. Slightly hazed golden pour, big loose white head. Very mild floral and caramel aroma. Tastes a little sweet and caramelly, a touch fruity, and becomes very floral and a mildly bitter on the finish. Not too remarkable, but has a nice mellow, balanced flavor.

Kroghs Belgian Wit;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;Drank as part of a four beer sample at Krogh’s in a six ounce glass.

AROMA: nice fruity banana and bubblegum scents; secondary smell comes as dampened basement--overall, favorable ... PALATE: rather clean and filtered; easy sipping/slamming, yet holds a bit of weight.. TASTE: sharp, edgy yeasts agitate; bubblegum is prevalent; less a wit and more a malty mash-up of wood grains; odd lemony fizz late; in time, the ping of malt mellows slightly--...OVERALL:the growler was clean, but I do not recall this wit being so abrasive--mildly refreshing but a bit of work to enjoy, until a few have been had.."

Kroghs Belgian Wit;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;A semi hazed yellow pour with off white head and lace. An odd odor of restroom drain and light pepper. Harsh stale drain like flavor, pepper, and lemon. Foamy and thin. Not in line with the rest of their beers I had this day. Something was just off.

Beermanns Schwarzbier;Lincoln, California, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Beermanns Beerwerks Brewery;Dark black color. Small to no head. Aroma is roasted malt with a hint of chocolate.

Fire Station 5 Golden Brigade Blonde Ale;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Reviewed from notes. Every time I had this beer, it was in a pint glass. The appearance was a nice light golden yellow color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipated within seconds. There was some really super light lacing sticking to the sides of the glass. The smell had some corn and rice with a delicate breadiness running about it. The taste was mainly sweet and offered a bit to be desired. On the palate, it sat fairly light and offered a decent sessionable quality about it. Overall, I say this was just a decent beer and nothing to go all out in seeking out. This is your basic average blonde ale.
Fire Station 5 Golden Brigade Blonde Ale;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours a hazy and slightly cloudy light straw, definitely strong carbonation and some sparse white foam that leaves decent lacing. There’s a strong pilsner-like malt aroma that arises from the glass, grassy notes, along with some DMS and corn. There is no distinctive hop presence. There’s a neutral taste overall, lager-like in character, a bit of fruitiness and plain, neutral malt. Although the carbonation is high, the finish is still lacking the thirst quenching/dry finish that should be found in Blonde and Cream ales. Overall it’s a plain and simple lawnmower beer.
Fire Station 5 Golden Brigade Blonde Ale;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle. Pours a mostly clear golden color with a smallish white head on it. Nose is light and has a little bit of corn in there, and actually reminds me a bit of a lager. Taste is relatively unremarkable, actually, which was disappointing, and much like the smell. Meh.
Fire Station 5 Golden Brigade Blonde Ale;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz bottle.

Fire Station 5 Golden Brigade Blonde Ale;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);a bit sweet and not enough hopping but it’s not nearly as bad as everyone is rating it here!

Sulphury apple and barnyard aroma with indeterminate fruity notes. Dry-sweet-acidic empty mealy apple taste with sulphury wooden notes. Fullish body. Mild, rounded mouthfeel.

Orchards Farm House Cider - Dry;Chepstow, Gloucestershire, England;Apple Cider;Orchards Cider;"My first cider rating! :-) Pours a murky orange-brown body with no head, although I see some bubbles down there somewhere. Smell is very yeasty and vinous, with barnyard funkiness and some earthy tones. Taste is dry and fruity at the same time, with plenty of basement aromas and yeast. Very low on sweetness and a well-disguised alcohol content. Drinkable and pleasant, but not anything that blows my mind. Bonus points in my book for being a dry and yet fruity cider; that’s one of my favorite styles."

Orchards Farm House Cider - Dry;Chepstow, Gloucestershire, England;Apple Cider;Orchards Cider;500 ml bottle. Slightly hazy golden body with close to no head and low carbonation. Relatively mild, but well pronounced aroma of ripe apples with a hint of mould and wood. Exactly as real cider is about by the way. Flavor is similar to the aroma, a real, ripe apples flavor with hint of mould, cellar notes and wood. Maybe a bit to mild and soft, could also have some more acid to be more than an average cider. Not particular exiting, but still very nice compared to those f**ing fake wannabe ciders like Somersby etc. that only contains 15% of apple juice and has nothing to do with a cider at all.

Newmans Wolvers Ale;Caerphilly, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Newmans;Nice rich foam which tend to be slightly creamy. The aroma is very sparse, possibly because of the compact foam. It has slightly fruity malt tones like flavor and not much else. As bitter ale is very tasty because it just hops palette is theme of this beer. Light caramel notes from the malt contributes to a scene where several hops notes will have room. It has the flavor of a breath of fresh grain or grass, spices and perhaps a little syrup towards the end. It is well brewed and in fact surprisingly good.
Newmans Wolvers Ale;Caerphilly, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Newmans;Bottle. Aroma of hops and flowers. Slightly unclear yellow colour with small white head. Very dry and definately bitter with notes of grapefruit. A bit watery texture.

Crystal clear pale amber in colour with a thin tight white head. Malty digestive biscuit notes in the short aroma. Good robust texture to the creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt base gives a maltloaf flavour with sweet sultanas, dates and pink grapefruit. Dusty, floral hop resins present in the short bitter aftertaste. Sweet malt returns in the slightly dry redcurrant fruit finish. An ok session ale and well recommended.

Newmans Woolly Mammoth Weis;Caerphilly, Wales;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Newmans;[Cask at GBBF 2005] An unclear orange beer with a small beige head. The aroma is sweet with light notes of banana as well as malt. The flavor is malty - though not much wheat malt present, but also light buttery notes as well as light banana notes. I’m not fond of cask wheat beers served at 12 degrees centigrade - I want my wheat beer cold.
Newmans Woolly Mammoth Weis;Caerphilly, Wales;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Newmans;Cask (gravity dispense), GBBF, August 2005. Hazy blonde colour. Strikes me that diacetyl is the last thing you want in a wheat beer, especially a delicate English one where the wheat is hard to pick up at the best of times. But there’s butterscotch aplenty here, both on the nose and the palate, and it doesn’t sit easily. Couldn’t really pick out much else other than a certain dryness. Dodgy condition? I’ll give this one another chance if I get the opportunity.
Newmans Woolly Mammoth Weis;Caerphilly, Wales;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Newmans;Banana, caramle aroma with some butter. Hazy golden-orange with decent, fin-bubbled white head that lasts well. Herbal hop flavour, rather grainy malts, and mild citrus in the finish. Light bitterness. Medium-light body with low carbonation. Butterscotch aroma and flavour become stronger as it warms. Cask at GBBF 2005.
Newmans Woolly Mammoth Weis;Caerphilly, Wales;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Newmans;Cask (GBBF): Banana, caramel fruity aroma. Bland though clean flavour. Medium-thin in body. Cloudy gold with a white head. Ok session beer, but smells better than it tastes.
Newmans Woolly Mammoth Weis;Caerphilly, Wales;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Newmans;On tap at GBBF 05. Nice, tempered sweet aroma. Thin in the mouth. Slightly smoked flavour, on the back of this malty brew. Not much wheat in evidence and a bit watery too. Drinkable, but not very. I don’t have much of a love affair with UK wheat beers, and this hasn’t changed things.
Newmans Woolly Mammoth Weis;Caerphilly, Wales;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Newmans;Cask conditioned - handpump - GBBF 2005. A golden coloured beer with no wheaty notes in the diacetyl spoilt aroma. The taste is dull with toffee and more diacetyl. Right at the end a wheaty lemony note comes through, but it’s all a bit too late for true redemption.
Newmans Woolly Mammoth Weis;Caerphilly, Wales;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Newmans;Cask at GBBF 2005 Golden, slightly cloudy. Bready yeasty nose, smells thin, is thin, not that great. Cardboard. Not a lot of finish
Newmans Woolly Mammoth Weis;Caerphilly, Wales;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Newmans;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Poured with particulate texture, light scattering all over the place. With time this defused to a foggy texture. Large frothy white head. Light aroma and flavour but distinct and clear hop and vanilla notes.

Southport Natterjack;Southport, Merseyside, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southport Brewery (UK);[cask at 2011 Battersea Beer Festival] Dark amber with a thin head - not a host of aromas coming from this one - some fruit maybe.

Southport Natterjack;Southport, Merseyside, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southport Brewery (UK);Dull golden. Almost a fresh grain aroma with quite a bit of woody hop. Slightly spicy with more toasty notes and fairly bready/biscuity malts.
Southport Natterjack;Southport, Merseyside, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southport Brewery (UK);Cask @ The Raven, Bath (coastal beer fest). Warm dark gold color. Really thick head. Nose is wholly unique to beers of this region: is floral, almost perfumy or soapy but in a good way. Bright and inviting. The body is unfortunately thin. Has some nice toasty malts in the beginning but has interesting floral and soap notes that are peculiar. Is too bland and does not live up to the promising aroma.
Southport Natterjack;Southport, Merseyside, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southport Brewery (UK);[i] Cask at The National Winter Ales Festival, Manchester 2007 [/i] Poured golden in colour with fruits and hops on nose, some honey and tangerine present themselves in the mouth and a reasonably dry and bitter finish, but I think this was starting to tire as it wasn’t as crisp or fresh as it could have been.

Melko kuiva ja vehnäinen vehnis, jossa banaania ei juurikaan havaittavissa. Vehnän lisäksi kevyttä hiivaista mausteisuutta. Keskitäyteläinen, kevyen hiilihappoinen suutuntuma. Melko vaisu kokonaisuus verrattuna parhaimpiin saksalaisiin veljiinsä.

Founders Devil Dancer Triple IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Delivers as advertised: This is a big, big IPA with the super-heavy pine-bark-like aroma that makes it seem as though an entire 50-foot Douglas fir was put through the wood chipper and strained into your snifter. Not so much extremely bitter (though it is bitter) as extremely dry. Almost needs a beer chaser. Bottle enjoyed nearly two years after its bottling on May 2, 2016 -- oh the joy of a beer fridge and dark cellar, and sons properly trained to let dad's beer rest undisturbed.

Ingredients are water, hops extract and barley malt. ABV is 5,3%. Poured into a lager glass. Pale golden yellow colour, with two fingers of white soapy head. Very good retention.

Härke Pils;Peine, Lower Saxony, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;BräuManufaktur Härke (Einbecker);12th May 2017: two half-litre glasses (on tap) sat on a raised terrace in the afternoon sun in the little town of Witzenhausen while waiting for the Schinkel’s Brewpub to open. Clear and clean golden body, snow white head that sadly didn’t hang around. Crisp and hop first in the nose and taste, decent malty undertone which backed off a little to give a good, dry, hoppy finish. Refreshing in the sunshine, espeicially after escaping earlier from Colditz Castle.

Le Cheval Blanc Märzen;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Le Cheval Blanc - Brasseur Artisan & Bar;In short: Plenty of whole-wheat cereals and plenty of woody hops. Highly drinkable amber lager. Very nice. How: Tap at brewpub. This rating for the 2008 batch The look: Almost clear pale copper body topped by a persistent small beige head In long: A ton of cereals with a whole-wheat bread flavour. A bit fluffy. A ton of hops with a fresh wet beechwood birch. Light fruity notes of citrus and gooseberries. A touch of caramel to tie it up together. Toasted but not really caramelized. An very nice overall freshness sensation. I don’t remember Cheval Blanc’s Marzen having been as good as this 2008 batch. Too bad it’s only brewed once a year because this is a beer I’d love to drink all year round. I’d be a much happier man if it was this beer that was the monthly ritual and P.M.S. the yearly affair.

Dieu du Ciel! Danse Macabre Triple;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Tripel;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;On tap at Dieu du Ciel. The color is amber with a thick beige head and lots of lace.The aroma is spicy.

Dieu du Ciel! Danse Macabre Triple;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Tripel;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;On tap, DDC. Dieu du Ciel does not generally specialize in Belgian-style beers (however their Rigor Mortis ABV is exceptional), but I thought I’d give this one a go. Pours red-orange, with a good-sized head. Aroma is sweet, primarily of fruit (peach, cherry, strawberry). Flavors were crisp, yet not as complex and mature as I would have liked in an Abbey Double. Although all aspects of the flavor were desirable (my girlfriend loved this beer), I found them to be a bit too straightforward, without the depth of beers of similar styles, such as Charlevoix’s DV Double, or Ommegang’s Abbey. Not one of DDC’s best offerings.
Dieu du Ciel! Danse Macabre Triple;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Tripel;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;In short: A fruity and very hoppy Belgian amber ale. Stinky annoying hopping to me. How: Tap at brewpub, 2008 batch (first batch since 2004 I think) The look: Clear golden copper body topped by a medium beige head leaving good lacing. In long: Nose is a bit stinky, that type of hopping that really doesn’t do it to me, like a urinal without the blue thing. Taste is very fruity with anything from citrus, kiwis, red apples, dried strawberries and more. A whole lot of cereals in there. Rather sweet. Sensation of a sweet fruity bowl of cereals. An old dirty rug feeling brings an almost rustic feeling to the beer. Finish is somewhat dry, very grassy, moderately bitter with a sweet fruity comeback. But again those hops are really annoying me. It sometimes happens that I get that annoying stinky/rotten/sweaty feeling from some type of hopping (Fuggels sometimes) but rarely to that degree. There’s probably a good beer in there but not for me. Classified as a Abbey Tripel here, called an Abbey Dubbel at the pub. I don’t like Abbey Twodotfivel.
Dieu du Ciel! Danse Macabre Triple;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Tripel;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Bu sur place en fut (12oz), le 25/10/08. Décrit comme une double à 7%. Blonde miel foncée, moyen collet. Arome malté pas très fort, des notes d’épice faibles et sucré. Goût un peu houblonné avec des notes d’herbe et d’aspérine, finission sucré au début mais elle devient amère dans la gorge. C’est bien, pas très savoureuse et l’arrière-goût gosse un peu mais on s’y habitue!

Dieu du Ciel! Danse Macabre Triple;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Tripel;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Dark golden yellow, light carbonation, white sticky head. Aroma is not too strong, mostly floral, yeasty (cookie dough), hoppy, fruity (pears, light apple). It feels pretty spicy on the tongue, brewmaster claims no spices are used the the magic of the yeast. Floral dry finish, orangey, minty hops. Creamy texture, medium bodied. Good take on the style
Dieu du Ciel! Danse Macabre Triple;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Tripel;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Slightly clouded gold color, thin head. Aroma of citrus and spices. Flavors of yeast and citrus.

Hochstift Pils;Fulda, Hesse, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hochstiftliches Brauhaus Fulda;"friends, back in the 1980's, I was stationed at Hanau Germany, between Frankfurt am Main and Fulda. We went to Fulda occasionally for a night of drinking and stay over. I remember this beer as one that I drank...it was better than Frankfurt's Henninger ""Kaiser"" Pilsner as well as Binding ""Romer"" Pilsner. Upon a trip back to Germany just a few years ago, and a stop in Fulda, I had this beer again. It is a good decent pilsner, and worthy to be quaffed! Dan Barton, US Army Retired"

Hochstift Pils;Fulda, Hesse, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hochstiftliches Brauhaus Fulda;"///As I was lucky :D to be born and grew up where Hochstift is brewed and at many restaurants and village/ town fairs you only get Hochstift. I have to say it´s one of the worst beers/pils I know... We always call it ""lovely"" Hochgift (High Toxic) as many locals hate that beer. It has a sparkly, malty taste with a strong bitter, hoppy, scratchy aftertaste. Usually I got headache afterwards and it tastes so bitter that many stomach acid is produced so propably you get heartburn as well./// Da ich ""glücklicherweise"" in und um Fulda geboren- und aufgewachsen bin, und auf vielen Dorffesten und in Restaurants es ausschließlich Hochstift zu kaufen gibt- muss ich sagen dass Hochstift das wohl schlechteste Bier ist was ich im In- und Ausland getrunken habe xD Wir Einheimischen nennen es ""liebevoll"" HochGIFT. Zunächst hat es eine spritzige, malzige ""Kopfnote"" wonach ein starker bitterer, hopfenlastiger, kratziger Nachgeschmack folgt. Es fällt schon schwer es runterzuschlucken. Ich habe sehr oft Kopfschmerzen davon bekommen und (vlt) weil es so bitter ist, produziert es (bei mir) auch viel Magensäure."

Intense roast on the palate with slight date and fig notes, hints of chocolate, coffee, nuts. Long finish with traces of hoppiness. Slight off-putting fruitiness. Somewhat thin, and though the requisite flavours are present they aren’t very cohesive.
3 Brasseurs Imperial Stout;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Stout - Imperial;3 Brasseurs / 3 Brewers (Canada);(Montreal location) : Odd ochre highlights through the darkness...Faint malt sweetness easily overcome by green hops...Low level of roastiness or of any other malt flavor for that matter...Way too thin for the style and heavily lacking in malt, nowhere near to countering the 45 IBUs...
Green Man Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Green Man Brewery;Middle of the road porter. A little bit of a unrememberable finish. Wouldn’t mind a six pack of cans of these. Is there a such thing as a session stout.
Green Man Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Green Man Brewery;Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. A thin tan head drops quickly with mild lacing. Color is dark red-brown. Aroma of cocoa powder and coffee. Mouthfeel is medium with a somewhat dry finish. Flavor of dark chocolate, cocoa, burnt toast, earthy hops. Overall: good but there is some level of flavor that is missing from this one. Just falls a little flat in the taste
Green Man Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Green Man Brewery;Found out of bottle from Ingles in Franklin, NC. Dark pour with a medium tan head. Nice light coffee and caramel malty aroma. Enjoyable and easy to drink. Really good winter option.
Green Man Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Green Man Brewery;Poured from cool-looking 12oz brown bottle into schooner glass, an opaque brown colour, reddish when held to the light, with weak beige foam, and a little lace. Fantastic malty/toasty/roasty/fruity aroma, but low in intensity. Flavour same but much bigger, breadier. True to style London Porter traits, I especially like the subtly tart berry and stone fruit notes, red wine tannins, eminiscent of Fullers' masterpiece. Medium body, nice full mouthfeel, hint of chalk, ash. Low-medium carbonation, lingering bittersweet/fruity aftertaste. Delicious, a truly great stylistic example, no wonder it is award-winning.

Green Man Porter;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Green Man Brewery;"12 ounce can into pint glass, canned on 1/31/2017. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, nuttiness, and toasted dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of dark fruit, smoke, herbal, grass, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. A bit too fruity/yeasty aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, nuttiness, and toasted dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of dark fruit, smoke, herbal, grass, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/grassy hop and roast bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, nuttiness, toasted dark/brown bread, herbal, grass, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; with a nice roast/hop bitter/sweet balance; and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering hop/roast bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 6%. Overall this is a very nice English porter. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Nicely rich English malt complexity, light earthy hop balance, and restrained yeast fruitiness. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."

Green Man IPA;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Green Man Brewery;"Crisp amber and copper coloured body with a nice, two centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of earthy malt, metal, nuts and a good deal of grassy hops. Medium-bodied; Strong grassy and very earthy flavour at first with some alcohol and metal noticeable as well. Aftertaste shows some earth, nuts, malt, pine and a little grassy dryness, but the hops show through along with some metallic off-flavours and a bit too much malt, but expected if this is an English-styled IPA. Overall, a decent beer, however, I sampled this horizontally with the Green Man Trickster IPA, which I preferred almost every aspect of that beer over this. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Grapevine in Fort Mill, South Carolina on 21-August-2017 for US$1,70 after watching the Eclipse, sampled at home on the Eastern Shore of Virginia in Pungoteague, Virginia on 02-September-2017."

Green Man Pale Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - English;Green Man Brewery;Had on tap at West First. Just totally average. Sort of like a crossover beer- if that is what they had in mind. Looks good (nice orange color with decent head) and smells good (citrusy) but taste is a let down. Just a bit flat and boring to me. Could drink a pint and not be offended, but could probably find something better. Like Green Man IPA, for example.

For all I know it could’ve been one of the other varieties listed in the database, but ""Pale Ale"" is what both chalkboard and waitron said. Bright pale copper pour, with fairly light carbonation. Isolated and large-ish bubbles rather than a foamy scrim. Dry fruit and hops in the nose, pale malts and leafy bitters. Mouthfeel is a bit of a letdown, prickly at first but then a bit watery. Flavors are quite dry for the most part, and refreshing for sure. But there wasn’t a huge amount going on here."

Green Man Brown Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Green Man Brewery;Draught. Pours an extra dark brown, really this looks more like a porter with a neat, tan head. The nose is muted with some faint notes of mild chocolate, hickory, pumpernickel. It’s a rather tart brown ale, not hoppy, but tart in a way similar to wood or pumpernickel. There is no strong sweetness and the finish is slightly acrid. This is just okay.
Green Man Brown Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Green Man Brewery;on tap at the green man - asheville nc - this review is for the cask version - see notes below for the regular tap version. coffee roasted aroma along with a medium to dark brown color. nice thick foamy head. served at a good temp for cask. great conditioning in the cask - mouthfeel was excellent. flavor was very good for a brown ale (where i expect bland). sweet malts with a bit of roasted coffe (a bit out of character and almost porter like). if this were an official beer cometition it would lose points probably for being out of style - but nevertheless, it was very drinkable and enjoyable. the regular tap version was way over carbonated and you could barely taste anything amidst all of the abrasiveness. my wife - who normally hates cask beer - much preferred teh cask version.

Hmmm, a fruity hefe, are we in trouble here? Well, let’s try to be objective: clear peachy amber, no bubbling or head really....faintly fruity/syrupy aroma, hints of vanilla and brown sugar....alas it’s a rather nasty mix of syrupy, cloying juice and sour mash in the body, a bit metallic/medicinal and quite artificial tasting....as I feared, it has that ""chick beer"" character without much real beer flavor, and the ingredients seem cheap and poorly put together.

Leek St Edwards;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Very dark red-brown beer with a yellowish small head. Stupefying nose of running smelly cheese as Camembert or even Herve, aggressive to say the least. Taste is perpendicular to the nose - even when this last keeps coming in whilst drinking AND returns diminuendo retronasal, proving it to be no imagination. Still, the main taste is nearly bone-dry, wry, woody and a bit mossy or dark green leafy in flavour. Despite the description on the label, it is neither bitter neither malty, though warming up, I get some lightly bitter chocolate. Medium bodied at best, a bit spritzy MF. To the point: I loathe the smell. The rest is noticably better, but there is no running away from this creepy cheese smell, which reminds me of a J.K.Jerome 3-man-in-a-boat episode.

Bayeux Cidre de Normandie Doux;Guéron, France;Apple Cider;Cidrerie Viard;75cl bottle as ’Cidre Bouche de Normandie’, pretty sure it’s the same. If I see a bottle with the other name I’ll make a seperate entry. Pours clear gold. Aroma of cider orchard, apple skins, breezy funk. Taste is fruity, generally clean but does have a faint sour, wild yeast air to it. It’s not bad, but this is a little off-putting in a French cider.

Super fruity apple aroma, a touch sour and sharp. Very sharp bit on the tongue, dry woody palate, very crisp and tart, but not lacking any fruitiness, not tasting underattenuated.

Sourish flavor, apples of course, some sweetness, as it’s expected, vinegar and cork notes, too. Sourish long, bit mouth pickering finish. This one was really fine for me, I look forward to brut version."

The nose is dusty, notes of cork, slightly funky/sulphury, apples. Not the most pleasant one around but does seem genuine. The taste, however was a bit of a letdown. Sweet, bit sulphury... basically an odd, kinda fakeish sweetness with a light, nice mouthpuckering appley tartness breaking through from time to time. Bit funky, notes of rice crackers maybe. And the odd sweetness again in the aftertaste. Wouldn’t exactly call it simple, but I definitely wouldn’t call it good. Shows some potential but isn’t as enjoyable as it should be...
Bayeux Cidre de Normandie Doux;Guéron, France;Apple Cider;Cidrerie Viard;"Light amber color; poor head. Ripe, oxydized apples aroma. Medium sweet, too much CO2, very simple."

Bire Pils;Udine, Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;BIRE - Birrificio Udinese;Già dall’aspetto non entusiasma, velata in modo un po fuori stile. Al naso un po’ vuota, gusto più dolce del mio personale gusto e in ogni caso nulla di che. Servita fredda, troppo, praticamente gelida.
Bire Pils;Udine, Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;BIRE - Birrificio Udinese;01/08 Draught at the brewpub. Poured murky golden body with smaller head. Quite nice malty honeyish aroma, with sourish unpasteurized hops and some yeast, as well. Watery, but fine flavor, some herbal bitterness is prominent here. That would be about it. Bitter, dry and rather short finish. Pleasant brew, but nothing special, particularly for brewpubs.
Bire Pils;Udine, Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;BIRE - Birrificio Udinese;Draught at the brewpub. -Pale honey coloured, small white head, yeasty nose. Not much of carbonation, fresh hoppy and mild yeasty aroma, but very watery. Typical slovenian home brew taste (Trieste is just few km away from Italian-Slovenian border).
Bire Pils;Udine, Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;BIRE - Birrificio Udinese;Cloudy orange color. The aroma is initially grassy, then a nice hoppy aroma is developing, later it’s a bit malty, honeyish. The taste presents some nice hop notes, but the malt is missing, the body is initially thin, ends with a strong bitterness, partially aromatic. It needs a better malt to be really ok, but it’s much more enjoyable with salty dishes.

Bire Nera;Udine, Italy;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;BIRE - Birrificio Udinese;01/08 Draught at the brewpub. Poured dark brown body with small brownish head. Sourish hoppy unpasteurized aroma with lot of coffee. Flavor was coffee as well, with notes of other roasted malt flavors like caramel and burnt wood. Finish is slightly sour, but mostly sweet caramelly. Still it wasn’t nothing special to me, but it’s made better than pils.
Bire Nera;Udine, Italy;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;BIRE - Birrificio Udinese;"Draught at Salone Della Birra Artigianale e di Qualità 2007, Milan In their flyer they compare the beer to the legendary U Fleku Dark mahogany color. Delicate beer, with some chocolate and roasted malt traces. Correct beer. I lost the original rating from the bottle, with Jens Ungstrup; we were both quite drunk in my small red apartment around Lausanne, after the Ouchy Beer Festival 2004; I had to wait 3 years before rating it again ;-)"
Bire Nera;Udine, Italy;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;BIRE - Birrificio Udinese;Draught at the brewpub. -This beer was very pleasant surprise.

Jacob Hackstein Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;12oz can Old Notes-Pours a pale yellow with a small white head. Aroma of corn. Taste of the same. Another light bodied pale lager.
Jacob Hackstein Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;355 ml can, Fargo, ND, USA. 30 cent clearance, had to try it. Pours a shockingly pale urine colour, thin head with an aroma of very very faint rice water. Very watery, no aftertaste owing to the lack of any other flavors, aromas or anything. Some dishwater on the finish.
Jacob Hackstein Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;You can’t get a beer that is this bad if you look everywhere. Makes me sad to be a human being
Jacob Hackstein Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Ugh, ugh, ugh. Goddamn that is disgusting. Its cheap, but there are better cheap beers. Do not waste your cash on this metallic, barfy, skunk secretion.
Jacob Hackstein Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;"Pours an average pale corn water yellow with a bright white head that fades almost immediately, but NOT completely. A thin layer of yeast remains floating over the beer. Very interesting. But not as interesting as it’s aroma. What is it? Lemon & melon? Yeast and grass? Has a strange grain flavor with a roasted aftertaste. This is a very unusual tasting beer. It has character, but it seems not to know what it’s trying to tell your taste buds. A nice diversion from the average ""cheap beer"". However I would like to know what the alcohol content is. Not what I expected for only $6.99 for a case of 24 cans at Woodmans in Kenosha, WI. on 11/22/06."
Jacob Hackstein Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;one of the top fie WORST beers ive had i HATE to say this BUT its worse than miller lite and thats some bad beer just horrible save your bones
Jacob Hackstein Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Thanks to tiggmtl for this one. Pours pale gold with big white head. Aroma of slight hopcit, some lemongrass. Tastes the same as it smells.
Jacob Hackstein Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;12 oz can (at $1.79 a 6, Woodmans of Janesville WI), Sultans of Swill tasting with tiggmtl and ClarkVV 10. Bit of head tops the very light yellow body...soft, sweet, bland mouthfeel follows a touch of dry grass in the nose...watery and simpering though there is a touch of sweetness...a masterpiece compared to most of what preceded it.
Jacob Hackstein Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Sweet, grassy, grainy aroma. Pale golden coloured body with decent cover of white head and some marginal lacing. Mild, sweet, grainy flavour is short-lived. Very low bitterness. Mild carbonation leaves this one feeling a bit still and sticky in the mouth. Can sampled with ClarkVV and muzzlehatch.
Jacob Hackstein Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Hahah, just looking at the picture to the left makes me laugh. Swill tasting with Barry and Stephen, can. Pale golden color, aside from the cider we had, this had a relatively decent yellow color. Small head, somewhat well retained. There is actually flavor in this one, I wont say it was great, but it has some sweet corn syrup, a little bit of metal and some lightly spoiled fruit notes throughout. Not disgustingly overcarbonated, a bit meaty all told and just really strange. My first Gluek product, I’m so proud!
Jacob Hackstein Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;12oz can Old Rating-Pours clear with a white head. Aroma of corn. Taste of the same with a bit of alcohol. This light bodied brew is pretty bad.
Jacob Hackstein Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;for a college student or someone watching there income but still wanting to have a good time, this beer is superb
Jacob Hackstein Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Bad bad awful beer but it is cheaper than dirt, literally you pay much more to buy dirt than this rubbish
Jacob Hackstein Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;The reason I gave this beer the score that I did is because they are a dime a dozen. Nasty Crap. Flat, bad tasting crap. Giving minnesota beers a bad name.
Jacob Hackstein Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;it’s cheap and will get you drunk, plus if you buy 10 cases at cashwise you get $1 off each case, tastes absolutely horrible though
Jacob Hackstein Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;This beer is a college beer drinker’s dream. For six bucks a case and higher alcohol content, it’s an amazing brew. It tastes better than most of the major brews and you can’t even tell the difference between this beer and any other cheap beer when its cold. I will be taking this camping in a few weeks.
Jacob Hackstein Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;12oz can Old Rating-Pours light golden with a small white head and an aroma of corn. Taste of corn. This light bodied brew is not too good.
Jacob Hackstein Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;About as bad as beer can get and still be called beer. Might as well be labeled toilet water
Jacob Hackstein Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Can. I can drink about any cheap beer ice cold, but not this crap. Metallic and husky and stale and just about every other off flavor you can think of. Yes, it may be 6.87 a case, but I’ll spend 2 or 3 more bucks and get a buzz beer that you can drink without holding your nose. Even drunk I couldn’t handle this. The fact that this brewery is less than 30 miles from me makes me uneasy.
Jacob Hackstein Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;EGADS! I’ve been Glueked again! Yellow with an aroma of skunky corn syrup, rust, and a light(hop?) bitterness, it’s grainy and corny and metallic and everything that I’ve come to expect from this brewer. I need mouthwash! Sal’s Beverage World, Elmhurst, IL
Jacob Hackstein Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;I got this as a matter of principle because it costs six dollars and fifty sense for twenty four cans. And indeed it tastes like the cheap crap that it is. It’s got your regular cheap beer grain character plus a weird not of banana--like a Belgian gone terribly wrong. Still, I’ve had worse and paid a lot more for it so this stuff serves a purpose.
Jacob Hackstein Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;A good beer for anyone looking to drink cheaply. I purchased 8 cases yesterday for less than 50 dollars. Pretty much just a good cold Miller Lite. I highly recommend it.
Jacob Hackstein Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;ahhh, i have seen the future of beer, and it is Jacob Hackstein. Crisp, smooth taste and given the fact that a case costs less than a wendy’s value meal make it a great choice for the college student looking to complete a few power hours or case races. A friend bought 8 cases for this weekend...i know what i’ll be consuming.
Jacob Hackstein Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;This tastes like Bud Light mixed with Coors Light, like a good clone of these to big time hardcore partier beers or something. I think I found a new King of Beers... now if they could just incorporate some Miller Lite into they would Monopolize the Macro Market.
Jacob Hackstein Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;If you looking for a cheap beer to tie on a buzz and can get by the first couple then this is the beer for you.

Frederik Tosin;Haljala, Lääne-Virumaa, Estonia;Malt Liquor;Viru Õlu (Harboe);Not produced any more. Young people used to get wasted just with 2 bottles of that brew. If you want to reproduce the taste - take any Baltic lager and add 2 shots of vodka in it. You will get 90% resemblance. All I could taste at that time was ethanol. One of the scariest beers I have ever had (there was also Saku President 10).

Frederik Tosin;Haljala, Lääne-Virumaa, Estonia;Malt Liquor;Viru Õlu (Harboe);(Bottled, BBE 10/2004) Copper color with small, lacy head. The aroma is surprisingly pleasant: fruity, yeasty, slightly sweet and very much like tripel. In the sweetish-malty and fruity flavor, the burning alcohol shows through quite strongly, but not unbearably. Medium-bodied, oily and alcoholic, very warming palate with medium carbonation. Surprisingly full-bodied, tasty and pleasant for a malt liquour. If I ever wanted to get really, really drunk really, really fast, I’d definitely consider getting a six-pack of this :)

Blind Tiger Belgian White;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;Very light yellow, like lemonade, but with a big frothy head.

Blind Tiger Java Porter;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Porter;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;Reviewed from notes taken during the Great Nebraska Beer Festival. Aroma has a nice, moderately strong, roast coffee aroma with some malt notes of light roast and moderate chocolate. A hint of green pepper with some light dark fruit esters. Pours a dark brown with a small, thick, tan head with decent retention. Flavor is similar to the aroma with quite a bit of freshly roasted coffee. Medium light roast malt note with moderate chocolate notes. Medium low bitterness with a light astringency. Low dark fruit esters, mostly plum and berries. Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium light carbonation. Medium low astringency and low alcohol warmth. An alright coffee beer, but I prefer my coffee to have a character more similar to a cold pressed coffee. The astringency was a bit higher than I would prefer. Malt balance was really nice as were the low dark fruit esters.

Founders Summer Braggot;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Mead;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"2004 harvest celebration...another decent beer brewed at my fav. microbrew...cloudy yellow appearance(similar to squeezed yellow grapefruit juice)...honey aroma, with the same flavor; nice palate; a very different style for me, but i was quite pleased"
Founders Summer Braggot;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Mead;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders for their 2004 Harvest Celebration. I missed this in its first go-round this summer, but Summer Braggot reappeared for this gathering of beer fans. This was possibly a new batch as the ABV was listed as 9.1%. Poured an unusually hazy yellow (almost tan) with a medium off-white head. Sweet honey aroma led to...you guessed it...a nectary, floral honey flavor with hints of alcohol following each sip. Pretty solid mead but lacking the unusual yeast characteristics that often define interesting meads.
Founders Summer Braggot;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Mead;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);very nice sweet musk aroma, with hints of spices, very yellow body with tiny white head, very sweet and sour, very carbonated, wonderful summer beer/ale/mead/whateveryouwannacallit!

Founders Chocolate Rye Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders. Roasty malt aroma with a twinge of rye. Flavor continues with dry roasted malt but the rye adds a unique spiciness to the flavor, and the beer also has a touch of dark fruit that enhances the roast and rye. Very good- just let it warm a bit! Founders serves their beers a bit too cold.
Founders Chocolate Rye Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Chocolate dark. A little ruby hue. Chocolate aroma. Creamy head. Bitter chocolateness. I didn’t really taste the rye too much, though.
Greenshields Maibock;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Draught. Amber orange color, small white head. Aroma is malty at first and then a little grainy. Flavor is also lightly malty at first and then it turns to bitter with an astringent aftertaste. At first this is an unpleasant finish, but working my way through about half a beer, I have to say that I have that sticky sweet feeling in my mouth that I am supposed to have with a maibock.

Hacienda Cerveza Potro;Penjamo, Mexico;Porter;Cerveceria Mexicana;Elegant packaging to this one, that is setting it up for fail. It comes in a mash tun shaped 500ml cobalt blue bottle with a tag and plastic over the cap. It pours a coca-cola colored brown with a fizzy but decent-lasting tan/off-white head. It leaves behind no lacing. The smell is off-putting and hard to wrap your mind around. It is confusing, I have never smelled these scents before in this style. It sort of smells like sulphuric farts mixed with wood varnish with a hint of tangy berry vomit surprise. I seriously have low hopes for this one after that rancid smell. Why Miguiel would you quit drysacking your hairy, sweaty dirt-grimed nuts in my beer! The taste is slightly better, a dry stout mixed with some tanginess. Perhaps they don’t set the highest quality control standard. It has a peaty cocoa powder undertone but a tangy lactic foreground. It has to be infested, but even so the base of it is weak. Not worth 6 freakin dollars, screw you cool looking bottle! Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 07-13-2010 00:37:07

Hacienda Cerveza Potro;Penjamo, Mexico;Porter;Cerveceria Mexicana;Bottle, 4.7%. Farty and sweet malt aroma. Cloudy very dark brown colour. Citric aroma, woody sourness. OK flavourful for the ABV, and not too bad.
Maximilians Bräu Weissbier Hefe Dunkel;Traunstein, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Maximilians Brauerei;Bottled. Cloudy orange/brown colour with chunks of yeast floating in it. Slightly off-white, lacey and frothy head. Marzipan and almond aroma with a cloves background. Flavours include notes of bananas, cloves, yeastiness and hints of marzipan ending in slightly hoppy and bitter finish. This beer appears medium-bodied, but ends a tad watery. As I´m not too keen on almonds and wateriness, this beer didn´t do it for me.

Draught at the brewpub, 2005-12-22, 7-4-7-3-14=35 Hazy blond color; nice lace. Similar comment, and similar Saaz hopping, but two point less because the bitterness is too high (too long infusion) and not very elegant.

Low carbonation (good point), good malt, residual sweetness; not complex, but enjoyable. Not convincing at the end: too long hop infusion…"

Kuhnhenn Radical Red Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;2004 draught. A highly experimental beer. Best fits in to amber ale, but it is quite unique. Pours a thick, HEAVILY clouded dark strawberry red with some light browns and oranges in the mix. It’s like watching a dry stout settle out after a pour. Good red tinged tan head. Smells wonderfully hoppy, lots of malt and light red fruit hints. Leafy and lightly earthy. Flavor is sweet at the beginning, with caramel malt and an almost vanilla iced cream sweetness. Light red raspberry hints and then a big burst of leafy, soily fresh hops. Tremendously fresh and not overdone. Balances perfectly against the malt, with a good bittersweet finish. Hints of pine and sap. The body is medium, but no thinning or wateriness and a moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is soft, fuzzy and lightly chewy on the finish. Great brew, hopefully they keep making this one.
Kuhnhenn Belgian Farmhouse Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Kuhnhenn Brewing;2004 draught. Mostly clear, light straw colored beer, with a decent foamy white head and good lacing. Smells very dry, of alcohol, light paint thinner, spicy hops, and a bittersweet acidity. Reminds me of vanilla flavored vodka too. Flavor is immediately very dry and astringent. Lots of warming alcohol, some light grain-like malt flavors, but no real sweetness. Touch of spicy hops on the finish add a nice flavor, but there is no real balance here, and too much of a ethanol/paint thinner quality, perhaps from the yeast or perhaps wheat malt(reminds me of the wheat wine). Medium body does not improve as it warms, though some light sweetness does peak through. Strange beer here.
Kuhnhenn English Brown Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;2004 Draught at the brewery. Pours a light mahogany brown with some lighter dark yellow tinges. Small light-tan head, moderately clear. Smells of light malt, brown sugar, hints of hops and a soft round nuttiness. Flavor is lightly sweet (caramel malt, brown sugar) hints of dates and figs with a sweet nuttiness. Finish, despite being English, has some good lightly bitter hops, slightly piney. Medium body, soft carbonation, good balance, a bit too much acidity from the fresh hops, though this really isnt a bad thing, just uncharacteristic of the style.
Detroit Brew Factory Smokestack Stout;Eastpointe, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Detroit Brew Factory;"May 2004 nitrogen keg. The bartender described this as a ""Milk-shake stout"". Pours a very cloudy/hazy dark black with some dark brown tinges. Good creamy off-white head. Very good looking beer. Aroma has a light hint of chocolate, milk, vanilla, cream and maybe some earthy barley. Flavor is moderately sweet, lots of chocolate malt, light lactose influences, vanilla flavors and touches of lightly dry black malt. Hugely creamy, very soft and velvety texture, drinks very thickly, almost like a milk shake. Quite good, though quite simple."
Detroit Brew Factory Bitter;Eastpointe, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Detroit Brew Factory;Mostly clear amber/brown, with some brassy hues. Small white head. Aroma of light toffee and caramel, touch of hops maybe, light soily smell to it. Flavor is quite dry, mildly bitter, lightly sweet (dry english toffee). Finishes with some nuttiness and light hops. Decently made bitter, nothing to go crazy about. Mouthfeel is light and mostly watery, though not out of style.
Detroit Brew Factory Strawberry Blonde;Eastpointe, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Detroit Brew Factory;May 2004 Draught. Pours a soft, light golden, clear and pale with a fleeting white head. Aroma of light grains, some soft strawberry essence and a touch of hops. Flavor has a good hops bitterness, though quite light, crisp and papery. Soft strawberry flavors make their way in but are not dominant. Like a light strawberry nectar. Mild sweetness adds balance, and the flavor comes together nicely. Clean, crisp finish again, light strawberry mixed with hops. Light bodied, moderate carbonation (but not too much as is the problem too often with this style). Most of these beers are characterized as fruit beers, but I think this one really hangs on to the blonde beer element first and foremost, with just a subtle touch of strawberry. I was just amazed that the hops were apparent in this, it wasnt cloying or just completely watered down. A wonderful rendition of a much maligned (mostly justified) style. Very refreshing.
Detroit Brew Factory Flamethrower IPA;Eastpointe, Michigan, United States;IPA;Detroit Brew Factory;2004 draught at the brewery. Pours a dark yellowish-brown with some light reddish tints, small white head. Aroma of galena hops all the way, leafy, soily, earthy, lightly floral. The brewer said it was galena, cascades and I think Northern Brewer, but I dont find much cascades. Flavor is dry right away, with a soft, fuzzy hops flavor, very earthy and mild. Bitterness picks up some and a decent malt flavor kicks in. It finishes pretty quickly with more fruity hops, moderately bitter (but still not citric). Muted for an IPA, not overly bitter, but still quite flavorful, with a good lingering hops flavor. Medium body, lively carbonation.
Detroit Brew Factory Brown Ale;Eastpointe, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Detroit Brew Factory;2004 draught. Drab olive-brown, with some light yellows, quite clear, small white head. Aroma has some light dry nuts, hints of hops. Flavor is lightly sweet, touch of astringency/paperiness. Lightly bitter, metallic taste, though as it warms some redeeming malt sweetness peaks through. Average at best.
Detroit Brew Factory Mead;Eastpointe, Michigan, United States;Mead;Detroit Brew Factory;2.5 year old 375mL Bottles for sale at the brewery. Pours a glassy pale gold with some light lime tinges. Little to no head. Smells lightly sour and pungent, extremely tart green apples, alcohol, hay, strong yeast and lightly spicy. Flavor is heavily acidic/alcoholic with a firm sugary (or probably more appropriately, honeyish) bite. Perhaps the age has created the thinning, but this is awfully watery and loose. It dosent go with the strong alcohol flavors. Should have been drank more young, or brewed to withstand aging better.

T - Starts off with some sweet dark fruit flavor with some lightly roasted caramel malts. Through the middle, some Belgian yeast comes through with some cherry flavor. The finish is a mix fo roasted caramel with some dark fruit sweetness and some yeast esters. M - Medium-plus bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with a sweet, dry, and roasted finish.

Church Brew Framboise Oud Bruin;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Church Brew Works;intresting beer, i tried to get one of my non-beer friends to taste this, but he only does lambics (flemish ales’s don’t count). Great aroma and flavor, very strong of rasberry. But other then obvious still have a nice laid back flavor and sat well.
Church Brew Framboise Oud Bruin;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Church Brew Works;A really interesting effort and a beer I hope they make again some day. +++Sampled on draft at the brewery. This one really sounded interesting. It looked great - Dark brown color with just a hint of red. Small tan head. Very strong sweet raspberry aroma. The flavor was tart and smooth. The fruit flavor was a bit weak and vague. The tartness was a bit overwhelming and keeps this one from being a great beer but it was a nice beer none the less.
Church Brew Framboise Oud Bruin;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Church Brew Works;Light sour raspberries at the beginning followed by sweetness (almost like a nutbrown ale), the two flavors interacted well. Body was a little thin. Tasted great with the chocolate mousse cake. (tasted this at lunch prior to the PA Microbrewer Fest at Penn)
Church Brew Framboise Oud Bruin;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Church Brew Works;This is a dark cloudy brown. The aroma is full of ripe raspberries with a little caramel malt beneath that. The flavor is light, but the malt steps out from under the fruit a bit.
Church Brew Framboise Oud Bruin;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Church Brew Works;Draft: Tawny auburn. Crackling, dusty-white head. Sweet malts in the aroma coupled with chocolate and fresh raspberries. Husky pale malt, raisin, and mild roast suggestions. Soft, minimal carbonation. The tartness is evident, but composed, and slowly threads its way into a blend of toasted pale malts and bittersweet chocolate. Raspberries are merely an afterthought to the pummeling malt richness. Finish is sweet, malty and astringent with underlying notes of chocolate and juicy raspberries. Strange mix of roast and burnt chalk linger. Not bad, but would be much better without all the acrid, salty flavors detracting from the tasty malts.
Church Brew Framboise Oud Bruin;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Church Brew Works;Hmm, interesting. Aroma is decent, slightly acidic with plenty raspberries coming through. Appearance is good, murky brown-red. Taste starts tart and fruity but loses its complexity about halfway through the sip and meanders around your mouth feeling dazed and somewhat malty until a disengenuous chalky finish. Thanks to cb and TAR for a great night out! Lord knows I need as much social encouragement as possible!

Yukon Deadman Creek Cranberry Wheat Ale;Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Yukon Brewing;I had several samples at the brewery. The appearance was a nice slightly hazy golden color that didn’t have any head or lacing. The smell had a faint combined cranberry and wheat with no expected grainy kick that I sometimes get in these types of beers. The taste was pretty much the same. On the palate, this one sat fairly light and sessionable. There’s no kick from the wheat or tang from the cranberry. Overall, I would say this would be a solid Summer choice for the hotter days but since I don’t live in the Yukon I don’t know how hot it gets there on the hotter days. Still, very worthy of coming back to.

This beer pours a hazy golden orange with almost no head. Aroma is malt and cranberries - and nothing else. The flavour had a weak tartness to it that can be attributed to the cranberries, but otherwise was a refreshing drinkable brew.
Yukon Deadman Creek Cranberry Wheat Ale;Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Yukon Brewing;"Drank from the bottle, sadly, as glassware was sorely lacking in my Yellowknife hotel. Has decent carbonation, okay brighter body. Soft, soft cranberry aroma with some maltiness. Flavour is just a hint of fruitiness with a beery malt back end and a dry finish. Drinkable, but everything about this brew needs more ""oomph""."

Liberator Golden Ale;Troutdale, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Liberator Brewing;A mildly citrusy golden beer that tasted like bud crashed into a lemon truck. A good hot weather beer to enjoy outside, but not a stand alone, relaxing beer. If you want to try a beer outside the big producers but a timid in your taste buds, then this would be a good place to start. I prefer darker beers anyway and found this beer lackin in character.

Liberator I.P.A.;Troutdale, Oregon, United States;IPA;Liberator Brewing;(Draft: Liberator Brewing in Troutdale, OR) Much more malty and balanced than their Naked Kernel IPA, the toasty maltiness is a much more substantial base.

Medium bodied, clean and crisp on the palate from start to finish. Golden color, darker than the Naked Kernel IPA, but again, the off-white head quickly fades to a small ring, leaving bits of patchy lacing on the glass. Decent, but no better than average for an IPA.

Lots of cabonation bubbles througout the glass. No smell whatsoever. Flavor is also kept to a minimum, sadly. A very plain, ordinary beer overall.
Willoughby Red Barrel Porter;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Porter;Willoughby Brewing Co.;Deep brown, nearly black in appearance. No head to speak of. Very faint chocolaty armona- not much there. Flavor reminds me of rootbeer and chocolate. It’s thick and rich. Alas, the mouth is thin... it could really use a lot more carbonation.
Broadstone RPA;Retford, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Broadstone;Cask, at Newark Beer Festival, May 2004 as Retford Pale Ale. Notes recovered from a recently unearthed old notebook. Pale gold. Quite pungent hoppy aroma of grass and grapefruit. Some American hops here methinks. Falls away a bit on the palate. Light mouthfeel. In short, a clean and refreshing blond quaffer with a bit more too it than many of its peers.
Broadstone RPA;Retford, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Broadstone;An orange beer with a small disappearing head. The aroma is sweet flowery, but also with notes of oranges and caramel. The flavor is flowery and grassy on a sour metallic background, while the end is dry - I don’t like the flavor.
Broadstone RPA;Retford, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Broadstone;Cask conditioned - no sparkler - Malt Shovel Northampton. Tastes and smells a bit like a rough homebrew but still better than the first two (more well known) beers drank tonight. The aroma to this pale ale is grassy and the flavour is rough and medicinal. It is though tasty and interesting even if one pint is enough. I think RPA stands for Retford Pale Ale,
Moonshine Mulberry Whale;Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Moonshine Brewery;Cask gravity, ’All Creatures Great and Small’ festival, The Merchant’s Inn, Drugby. Headless red amber. Beeswaxy oak aroma. Slick, mellow and oaky with wholemeal, faint chocolate and butter biscuit, some honey coated wheat. Odd but good.
Moonshine Mulberry Whale;Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Moonshine Brewery;Draught (Carlton Arms, Cambridge) Between orange and red, no head. Sweet coffee aroma, something savoury too. Taste is mysteriously coffee-like too and also that odd savoury flavour I can’t place. Leaves a brown finish - some nuttiness.

Moonshine Mulberry Whale;Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Moonshine Brewery;Cambridge Beer Festival. Gravity. Brand new brewery, just opened in Cambridge. As far as I’m aware this is the first beer offered by Moonshine, and this came on for the first time while I was there. So I am one of the very first to have a beer from this brewery. Well, it’s a darkish caramel coloured best bitter with caramel notes and a pleasant dusting of hops. A decent enough old school style best bitter. Mmmm. Gets better.
Randalls Sipping Bull;St Peter Port, Guernsey;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Randalls Brewery;Cask at GBBF 2006. A hazy amber beer with an orange head. The aroma is sweet with light notes of hops and malt. The flavor is sweet with notes of caramel, lightly burnt malts, dry flowery hops, and light notes of fruit, leading to a dry woody end.
Randalls Sipping Bull;St Peter Port, Guernsey;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Randalls Brewery;"According to the programme notes this is ""a blend produced for a pub on the island"". It is not clear what it is a blend of. It’s a quite deep brown colour. Caramel and soft malt dominates the aroma. The flavour is soft and underpinned by sweetish treacle toffee accents. Not really to my taste. Negligible hop presence. Candy sugar finish. Becomes a bit cloying. A rare appearance on the mainland. Cask (gravity), Cambridge Beer Festival."
Randalls Sipping Bull;St Peter Port, Guernsey;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Randalls Brewery;Cambridge Beer Fest. Gravity. Reddish brown and sweetish bitter in the Celtic style - lows hops and sweet malt in a light and refreshing body. Lively condition. The result is rather like cola or fizzy sarsaparilla. Leather malt aroma.
Rockingham Fruits Of The Forest;Elton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rockingham Ales;Cask conditioned gravity dispense Northants Beer Festival 2011. A copper coloured beer.

Rockingham Fruits Of The Forest;Elton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rockingham Ales;Cask (gravity dispense) at GBBF, August 2005. After three days where dull beers were too much in evidence, Friday has started off with a run of excellent beers. Amber colour There’s certainly plenty of fruit notes in evidence here - blackberries, plums and damsons. Juicy, succulent stuff. But there’s a sour edge that works really well too and plenty of spicy, tangy hops. Good bite on the finish. Delicious.
Rockingham Fruits Of The Forest;Elton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rockingham Ales;Large floral, earthy, lightly citrus hops and chewy caramel malts in the fruity aroma. Clear burnished copper with decent off-white head that recedes to lasting cover with some light lacing. Perfumey, citrus, earthy, spicy, floral hops blend with thick caramel malts and dark fruity esters in the complex and nuanced flavour. Lasting bitterness in the finish. Medium body is full in the mouth with moderate carbonation. Cask sampled at GBBF 2005.

ABV was listed as 4.2%. Golden colour. Aroma of spices and fruits of the forest (no surprise). Flavour is slightly spicy and ""forest fruity"" (of course), blackberries and blackcurrants come through. Not bad at all."
Rockingham Fruits Of The Forest;Elton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rockingham Ales;Cambridge Beer Fest. Gravity. Reddish amber. Mmm - appropriate name, this is packed with assorted autumnal fruits. Rather sticky with residual pale malt sugars. Some soft, soft hops come through late in the finish along with elements of ginger. Interesting, attractive and very compelling. I can see why this was Festival Champiion last year.
Old Stables Palomino Pale Ale;Sandy, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Stables Brewing Co.;"Cambridge Beer Festival. Marked on the pump: ""Sadly, the very last brew from this micro-brewery"" :( Golden, slightly cloudy and the head goes quickly. Very malty, with yeast aromas, perhaps slightly grassy in the nose. Bland but OK."
Old Stables Palomino Pale Ale;Sandy, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Stables Brewing Co.;A pale beer with solid maltiness that carries right through the flavour and has a slight bitterness in the finish.

Old Stables Palomino Pale Ale;Sandy, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Stables Brewing Co.;Cambridge Beer Festival - Gravity. Pale session bitter of little character. Quite fresh and tasty enough, but just a bit underbrewed.
Trailhead Core of Discovery Honey Apple Wheat;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Trailhead Brewing Co.;Cloudy yellow/off white color. Very light bodied, as expected with the ingredients listed. Grainy wheat aroma accompanied with apples. The honey was lost to me. No banana or clove esters, it would be based on an american wheat. Tastes like an apple cider wheat beer.

Contract brewed & bottled for Getränke Hoffmann as Gruben-Pils at 5% (I’ll go ahead rate this as an alias to spare us all the trouble of having to add another generic Nemo Namenlos alias pils). Eerily generic lower spectrum white label pilsner, might as well be Schlossbräu or Lidl’s white brand: harsh hay and grass, a green apple meatiness, metallic hop extract finish, without becoming offensive.

Aroma is wheaty, grassy, and nutty. Flavor of nuts, honey, lemons, and butter. Medium bitterness and considerable sweetness with some breakfast cereal qualities. The sweetness is detracting, like using worms to catch fish.
Toast Kohan no Mori Dunkel;Senboku, Akita Prefecture, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Toast Tazawako Kohan no Mori Beer;"on tap at the brewpub, big thanks to josh for driving out from yokote. amber with a bubble wrap head; caramel and brazil nut aroma which carries through to some sweet and nutty malts. just with an addition of some grassy hops, this could have been a pretty good beer"
Toast Kohan no Mori Dunkel;Senboku, Akita Prefecture, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Toast Tazawako Kohan no Mori Beer;Dark amber orange color, creamy white head. Doesn’t look as carbonated as the other beers. Caramel and strawberries in the nose. The mouth is full of caramel, strawberries and apricots. Unbalanced and fairly unpleasant. No distingushable chocolate characters going on either. Dry finish. Blah
Toast Kohan no Mori Dunkel;Senboku, Akita Prefecture, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Toast Tazawako Kohan no Mori Beer;Draught at the brewpub. Medium amber color with a large, fine, frothy head. A bit too light. Faint caramel aroma. Sweet, big, caramel flavor, with toffee, but with a big, bad, bitter finish. Slightly strange, with rather bad balance. The bitterness is too big, plus it has a candy taste and a very light mouth. Not horrible, though.
Toast Kohan no Mori Dunkel;Senboku, Akita Prefecture, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Toast Tazawako Kohan no Mori Beer;A dark Amber/Orange color with a medium foamy tan head. Mild caramel scent with floral hops. An intersting pipe tobacco like taste at first, specialized malts, caramel flavors with a mild hop bite, a mild bittersweet follow. A solid brew and a nice treat here in Lager land.
Tazawako Kolsch;Senboku, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;Keyaki fall 2016. Light honey and floral notes with some faint stone fruit notes in the background. Clean and easy drinking with good carbonation and some light creaminess. Light hoppy finish.

Tazawako Kolsch;Senboku, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;Draught at Keyaki 2014. Nice balance, fruity malt, floral hops, touch of honey, gentle sour finish. One of the smoothest Kolsch I’ve had from Japan.
Tazawako Kolsch;Senboku, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;Bottle from Nomono. Kolsch like… creamy, grainy, light grassy hops. Very drinkable. Pretty crisp. Nice lightly bitter finish. Not my favourite style, but a pretty nice, example.
Tazawako Kolsch;Senboku, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;Sample at the Hanshin Seed Event. Clear gold, sweet grain aroma- possibly slightly buttery? The taste is grainy sweet, a bit of green bitter hops in the finish, a bit light malts & breadiness. OK.
Tazawako Kolsch;Senboku, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;Bottle 330 ml at a tasting on October 30, 2013 (backlog). Thanks to Ingo! Marked 13.10.13. Clear yellow to pale golden color, small white head. Malty, vegetable, light fruity, sugary, some esters and phenoles scent. Fruity, minerals, fizzy, wet sand taste. Fizzy mouthfeel, low bitterness. Mineral aftertaste.
Tazawako Kolsch;Senboku, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;Grassy hoppy nose, with hints of hay. Soft body, well balanced, but a bit too much hops for the style. Short, dry floral finish, but bitterness is appropriately toned down. Freshing and light. Good for a summer day.
Tazawako Kolsch;Senboku, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;"Bottle from the brewery. Light golden color; average for the style. Fruity, slightly sweet, slightly hoppy aroma. Taste is right on—fruit, light malt, some honey, decent hops, too! A well-made Koelsch on the hoppy, full-flavored side."
Tazawako Kolsch;Senboku, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;bottled. pale golden, minimal white head, light hay aroma, quite simple with a lightly tinny bitterness. pretty decent attempt at the style
Tazawako Kolsch;Senboku, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;A deep golden beer with an off white small head. Some micro floaties give it a slightly cloudy look. A slight grainy smell with a touch of sweetness. Malts up front, mild with a bit of a tart bite in the middle, the slight sourness lingers with a very slight hop follow. Not a bad beer, if Kolsch is your cup of tea, you will like this one.
Chateau Kamiya Apple Lager;Ushiku-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Chateau Kamiya (Ushiku Beer);A slightly hazy golden/straw colored beer with a ciderish scent to it. Just a slight touch of carbonation, tastes like apple juice....in fact at only 2.5% Alc, it is apple juice. It would be a great thirst quencher on a hot day or a nice drink for non-beer drinking ladies. I think they were trying for a Floris style brew but they missed the mark a bit.
Three Floyds Precious;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Pour on tap at the brewery, dark reddish black pour with tan head, aroma brought notes of cocoa, caramel, toffee, nice pine and spicy hops as well into a bit of earth. Taste was a mix of caramel, cocoa, roast into some pine, grass, touch of spice with more cocoa, finishing dry, bitter.
Three Floyds Precious;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Aroma is graham cracker, cocoa, biscuits and coffee. Draft pour at Moxee. Black with a ton of foamy and creamy off white head. Taste is tobacco, leather, malts, cream, cocoa and coffee. Fantastic beer
Three Floyds Precious;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;"Draft to pint. Looks good; a lightly translucent dark cola with foamy beige head. Smells and tastes like a Black IPA; dark malt, bitter and piney hops, and a bit of toastiness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Enjoyable."
Three Floyds Precious;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at the Pint Room. Dark brown pour with a thin tan head. Smoky roasted malt, mild hops and toffee in the taste and aroma. A good, but not outstanding porter.
Three Floyds Precious;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at 3 Floyds. Pours near black with a thick tan head and a treacle aroma. There is a hearty dark molasses and smoked malt flavor with a bitter slightly carbonated finish.
Three Floyds Precious;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;This was good porter with a nice balance and sessionable qualities. Dark but not overly strong. The darker malts were complimented well by a little more hop bitterness.
Three Floyds Precious;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Pint at the brew pub. Black body. Thin light tan head. Light, yet creamy body. Taste is an abundance of fruity hops. Which actually balances quite well with with sweet toasty malts. Classic 3 Floyds - hop a beer that doesn’t normally get hopped mentality. Yet seems restrained by today’s standards. What this really reminded me of was a handful of black IPAs brewed circa 2011, before everyone got obsessed with rye malt and ruined the style.
Three Floyds Precious;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Precious Three Floyds at The Pint Room in Carmel, IN. Poured in to a tester. Look - Dark yellow-brown. Good ivory to tan head on tester glass. A lot of lacing. Head does settle to nothing. Smell - Dank hop. Chocolate. Char. Berry. Taste - Very hoppy as advertised. Chocolate. Bubblegum. Bready malt. Charred. Lemon. Citrus finish. Feel - Chewy. Medium. Very carbonated. Bitterness on tongue. Overall - Chocolate bubblegum hoppy porter. As close to a black IPA as you can get. I see why this was brought out of retirement. Floyds roots.
Three Floyds Precious;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at FFF. Pours thick unclear dark black coffee with a creamy and lacy light cocoa colored head. Aroma is lighter roasted and toasted malts. Brings delicious flavors of roasted malts followed gently by the softer piney hops balancing in a creamy body.
Three Floyds Precious;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Excellent hops and fruity porter. On tap at fff. Hop aroma. Delicious a little cherry. Great drinkability.
Three Floyds Alpha Khan;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Tap: 5-30-06. Dark copper, huge frothy head, great lacing, entire glass is coated. Great aroma, huge orange, mango, grapefruit zest, plenty of backbone. Flavor again, very zesty up front, orange, mango, grapefruit. Huge caramel through the middle, floral character cleans the palate in the finish. Great balance for a big brew. Well done.
Three Floyds Alpha Khan;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Had this beer on 10/7/1999. Aroma is very hoppy. Color is a nice brown with good carbonation and head. Taste is a mild malt flavor on a medium body with great hop flyover, then finishes with a nice bitterness and more hop flavor. Its like drinking hop juice. I really like it, its a very tasty Pale Ale.
Three Floyds Alpha Khan;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Draft from 3F brewpub. Clear copper pour with white creamy head. Floral and hop notes in the smell. Crisp flavor with more hops, caramel, and spice. Slight bitterness in the finish. Not Alpha King, but very good.
Three Floyds Alpha Khan;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Notes from the GTMW ’06. Clear orange with a moderate eggshell head. Aroma of sweaty pineapple and grapefruit hops, and some sweet caramel malts. Flavor was grassy, otherwise the same as the aroma--fruity and grassy are underlined. Light body, moderate smooth carbonation. Pretty good.
Three Floyds Alpha Khan;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;kind of spicy and similar to alpha king. served in an imperial pint at the fff pub.........nice
Three Floyds Alpha Khan;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;on tap at FFF. i recall it being listed as either 6.7% or 6.9% abv. this baby poured a hazed copper-golden with white head. nose is very PNW hoppy but spiced as well w/ cloves and maybe cardamom, mixing well with grapefruit hop aroma. the taste is nice and bitter with strong spiciness w/ cloves and cardamom. the flavor is really interesting how the spices play with the PNW hop fruity notes making this a unique take on an ipa. they do pull it off, quite well, but i’m not a huge fan of these spices so i drink think wishes it wasn’t spiced. but the hop flavor is awesome, real bitter and fruity. the body is light and palate is long w/ mild bitterness and grapefruit notes lasting long on the palate. as i get closer to finishing this i want more, maybe the bitterness and alcohol dulls my sensitivity for the spices. every hophead should try this.
Three Floyds Alpha Khan;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at FFF. Rich golden brown with a rocky off white head. Really nice lacing. Big floral hops. Juicy! A round malt base. Balanced, but barely. A little citrus. Alpha King on steroids. Not watery, but not thick. A little fizzy, but not undrinkably so. Big assertive herbal hops. A bit minty? Sweet not huge round malt with amble balancing bitterness. Crisp peppery floral citrus finish. This, I could drink regularly.
Three Floyds Alpha Khan;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;on tap FFF. I wish that FFF would botte this one!! Smells of pines and hops. I tasted a somewhat stroger pale ale but thats just me. Greate biiterness. I cannot wait to try again
Three Floyds Alpha Khan;Munster, Indiana, United States;IPA;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at Three Floyds Brewpub, and served in a pint glass. This brew poured a dark, copper/orange color with a two-finger thick, rocky beige head that lingered. Some nice, thick lace was left around the glass. The aroma was made up of a big, sweet, biting grapefruit presence, caramel, and also some lasting pine bitterness. The flavor was very similar to Two-Hearted Ale. And yes, by saying that, I mean it as a huge compliment. All of the familiar IPA flavors exist in harmony, but at the same time, this beer is very robust and flavorful. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and slightly resiny with light carbonation. I you are a fan of strong IPA’s and such, this is a must try. I just wish it was on tap more often.

Newby Wyke White Sea;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask @ Dirty Dick’s, Halifax. Blonde with a smooth head. Hoppy ale with its strength fairly hidden, and a dry fruitiness which is most stated in its nose, alongside a floralness.

Newby Wyke White Sea;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Peterboro BF 2008. A slightly hazy golden coloured beer with a nice hoppy nose with lemons and pineapple. Sweet in the mouth like pineapple fizz bombs. Decent enough but the sum of chinook and Mount Hood should produce a spanker.
Newby Wyke White Sea;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask, gravity, at Peterborough BF ’08. Pale gold. Sweet, almost sugary aroma with just a little lurking sourness. maeib’s unerring nose accurately identified the fruit I was looking for: pineapple. Taste is soft and fruity with biscuit in the background and a final mid bitter rush. Full of interest. 6.9.10, Cask, gravity at the Pig ’n’ Falcon, St Neots, Cambridgeshire.To be honest I thought this was more ’copper’ than my previous ’pale gold’. In addition to the above comments, I noted hair oil and wet dog. Rating:6,3,6,4,11:3.0
Newby Wyke White Sea;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask at Merton Summer Beer Festival July 18th and 19th 2008 Light golden pour with white frothy quickly disappearing head. Plenty of grapefruit on the nose but not a lot else.

Newby Wyke White Sea;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;A Mes rate: Gravicask at Fin’s excellent Merton Beer Festival. Hazy yellow gold with a thin white head and yet more evidence of Fin’s hard work to keep all the beers at the festival in sparkling form. Assertive lemon sherbet hop aroma with a decent malty backbone. The flavour follows on really well. The hops are very good and give bags a fruity character. The earthy malt is adorable and it is all wrapped up in a really pleasing dry bitter finish. Straight forward English class. Jolly good.

Smell: Sweetish apple aroma blended with honey and wafts of harsh alcohol. This is no Strongbow, that’s for sure.

Putney Mountain Scott Farm Spy;Putney, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Putney Mountain Winery;"Thank you jjpm74 for this experience! ;~D Very pretty blue champagne bottle. I feel guilty opening this alone. Possibly has the aroma of a strong Belgian or something really sweet. This brew has some bubbles rising in there but no head. Fusel~ness hits the olfactory immediately on the first taste. This is strong and wine like. The alcohol content is out front and knocking. You may want to think twice if you are planning to have more than 12 oz. This stuff is taste bud numbing. It is overpowering to both tongue and nose if thought of on a beer rating site. USA malt liquor brewers rejoice! Each swallow is alarming to the back of my throat. Barely any detectable carbonation. I never would consider this a drain pour, but I may put it back into the bottle and reset the plastic cork. I’m going to save this for a special occasion. This is the imperial of cider. Imperial stout and imperial IPA….now we have imperial cider. This stuff is hypnotizingly brutal. Those of you who love high alky percent better go try this. Coarse, very coarse; clear and coarse. I don’t think this should be rated as a beer, nor cider, way too strong. However, I also believe that imp stout and ipa is a difficult to enjoy brew! . This is the stepping stone from beer to hard liquor. This is Pennsylvania state store territory. You IPA and impy stout lovers will either hate or love this cider. Kicks yer guzzi."
Putney Mountain Scott Farm Spy;Putney, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Putney Mountain Winery;This is one of my wife’s favorites. Somewhere between cider and champagne sits the creations of Putney wines. Soft and spicey with some decent carbonation. A nice sipping beverage when sitting in a sizzling hot jacoozi on a cold winter’s night overlooking the mountains of VT.

Okult Meebock;Redange, Luxembourg;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;This bottled version has a large Duvel like self generating white head, the aroma is of honey,hops and a little raisiny. The colour is a gold/dusky gold(if you add the sediment) The flavour is of honey and fine malts, with the sediment the flavour becomes more solid with a pronounced yeastiness - no wonder. It finishes off very softly with an aftertaste of crystalised malt, yum,yum, I’m going to have some of this in the cellar for special occasions ! I would like to add also there is a draught version too. In it's draught version the beer is a cloudy gold colour, a sweetish hoppy aroma with a quickly subsiding head, but a better flavour than the bottled version - more complex.

Founders Cherry Java Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On nitro tap at Founders. Very likable and tasty- like drinking a cold coffee with a touch of cherry syrup added, or perhaps a Brachs chocolate-covered cherry nougat. Rather thin-bodied, but the roasted malt, coffee, cherry, and hint of chocolate are still notable. An interesting twist to the regular Java Stout.

Kuhnhenn Saison;Warren, Michigan, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Kuhnhenn Brewing;12oz bottle. Poured a hazy amber color with a small sized off white head. Yeast, some fruitiness, and a sourness.
Kuhnhenn Saison;Warren, Michigan, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Soft white pepper. Mild funk. Light yeast and bread. Mild flavors but good and refreshing.
Kuhnhenn Saison;Warren, Michigan, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap @ Kuhnhenn: Dense amber body, orange hints with a gray-white layer of foam on top. Gummy aroma, lots of Belgian yeast, damp hay, bubblegum, white pepper, a touch of spruce, small medicinal tones, a touch of caramel. Flavor is sweeter than expected for a saison. Burnt bread, hints of caramel, maybe even some toffee. Bubblegum, spruce, light mint, white pepper, & a bready Belgian yeast finish that lingers. Not bad, but doesn’t remind me of a saison.
Kuhnhenn Saison;Warren, Michigan, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Very mild for a saison. Not much yeasty, funk, or floral character. A bit more of a tea undertaste. Not bad, and easily drinkable.
Kuhnhenn Saison;Warren, Michigan, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Kuhnhenn Brewing;29th July 2011 Very hazy amber beer. Small white head. Strong caramel nose. Light crisp palate. Strong butterscotch and caramel. A trace of citrus hop. Finishes dry. Very odd. Way too much butterscotch - diacetyl? Or some weird yeast?

Kuhnhenn Saison;Warren, Michigan, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Kuhnhenn Brewing;12oz bottle picked up at the brewpub. 2011 Summer Solstice. Pours a cloudy, orange-gold colored body with a finger-width, frothy and fizzy, off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is fairly sweetly malted with some florals and a bit of a tart citrus and apple. Some bready caramels and a bit of a honey sweetness. Flavor is very sweet again with a more distinct, fruity tartness...and none of it seems to balance very well. Caramel and honey bread, tart apples and lemons, a bit of a coriander spice, and a yeasty twang. Finishes dry with a light, spicy bitterness and an odd mix of sweet malts and tart fruits. Lengthy aftertaste following a medium body and a fizzy carbonation. Overall, another disappointing bottle from these guys. I loved the beers I had on tap at the brewpub, but these summer solstice bottles just aren’t very good. This isn’t absolutely terrible, but it’s not that good.
Kuhnhenn Saison;Warren, Michigan, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Kuhnhenn Brewing;12oz Bottle. Thanks for sharing, Sean. Aroma has an aged malt component. Flavors are kind of messy. Some indiscriminate spice and wet cardboard. There’s even the charaterisitc Kuhnhenn twang that’s oh so unfortunately familiar. In some ways, this is like the trans-Atlantic notion of Fantome, but without a pop. One-dimensional. There’s some definite cooked corn in here. Really feels like sloppy brewing. Bad DMS problem, bad beer.

Willoughby 530 Gold;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;Willoughby Brewing Co.;"Brand new offering from Willoughby- which the waitress descibed as being the ""lightest beer we ever brewed."" OK, well whatever, give me one so I can sample this new beer. BEAUTIFUL appearance. Bright golden yellow, that’s 90% clouded over sitting on top of something that looks like MGD. This is a nice looking beer, frothy, creamy, decent head. Not much of a smell to be had- which is neither good, nor bad. Tastes like water with a piece of grass in it.... really. No flavor whatsoever. Worst beer as of yet from this brewery in terms of taste. Mouthfeel??? Flat! This is water. No carbonation at all in the beer. Do yourself a favor and enjoy someone else having this beer. It’s beautiful, but has no taste. Pass this one up."

Orlando Brewing Blackwater Dry Porter;Orlando, Florida, United States;Porter;Orlando Brewing Company;Got this in a variety 6-pack (Blackwater Porter, English Style Pub Ale, and Eurostyle Pilsner) while touring the brewery last week.

Has a black appearance with creamy mocha colored head. Lots of coffee in the aroma, but besides that not much else going on there cept slight chocolate and hops. A well balance porter, maybe a little on the thinner side. Robust coffee flavor as well. I'd say the best of the 4 different Orlando Brewery beers that I sampled so far.

Calumet Hunters Choice;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Draft at the OF. Thin, yellow-orange color, looks filtered. Minimal head. Creamy aroma which matches the taste. Very Cream Ale, tastes kind of like a diacetyl bomb, which you don’t see in a Pils that much. Has some light background hoppiness, but still dominated by the butterscotch creaminess. Not a great Pils by any means.

Russian River ESB;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Russian River Brewing;On tap @ brewery. Copper colored with an offwhite head which quickly became a thin ring, leaving behind thin, splotchy lace. Body was light to medium with lightly foamy carbonation and a dry finish. Aroma was of caramel and standard English malts...earthy and sweet...weak aroma. Flavor was pleasing with caramel and apple with a lightly bitter finish of oak and apple skin. The brewery had it labeled as an English Pale Ale, which the beer is more suited to for style. At any rate, it’s traditional, English and fairly boring, but pleasant. Almost like apple cider...

Moonlight Double Vision IPA;Santa Rosa, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);When you’re in the mood ... and I was .. this has the power to battle the aggressive atmosphere of a Toronado night as the volume is cranked to ear split by bar staff.

Moonlight Double Vision IPA;Santa Rosa, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);On tap at Toronado.

Rating #2 Tap @ Toronado (7 3 6 3 16). A foamy white head on a dark golden colored beer. Rather dry and quick finishing (clean and crisp) with a grassy hop aftertaste. There is a subtle complexity, but I was disapointed in how light this beer was compard to others in the style.
Moonlight Double Vision IPA;Santa Rosa, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);Draft. Hazy deep amber with a thin white head.

The aroma is pretty faint with a skunkiness in the best most subtle way possible.

Pours a clear golden with a white head that laces down. Sweet malts, apricots, and a touch of grapefruit in the nose. Clean flavors. The citrus and malts are balanced and really drinkable. Nice dose of hops. The saaz is barely noticeable, but a light herbal finish. I could easily throw down a few of these.
Rock Bottom Chicago Rooftop Pilsner;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Chicago;on tap at RB Chicago. ’08 vintage. served in a stein. I’m not sure if this has changed a lot over the years but this summer it is a really nice pils. lots of saaz hop flavor, very clean and refreshing. actually this is wonderful. easily the best pilsener brewed in chicago and probably the state. hopefully I can go back for more and take notes next time. you could drink this for hours and not get sick of it.3.7. 8/19/08, a month later and this has been getting worse in the kegs. the hops have diminished, and there’s a strong metallic finish.3.5.
Rock Bottom Chicago Rooftop Pilsner;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at RB Chicago. Poured a clear brighter golden with a short, creamy white head. Aroma was of sweet bready malts with a hint of lemon.. quite soft and enjoyable.. lots of Saaz going on! Flavor was of sweet bread and pils malts at the base with a mild floral bitterness going outward.. left a dusty lemon zest and some mild floral bitterness at the finish.. tasty stuff! Light-medium bodied, dry, and refreshing with a nice flow to it. Not much in terms of complexity, but very well executed! On tap at GTMW as Hoppy Pilz: Poured clear, very bright golden with a short-lived fizzy white head. The aroma was sweet and bright with lots of lemon zest over pale bready notes.. not bad. The flavor had pale malts supporting bright lemon zest and floral notes.. on the lighter side & refreshing. Dry and light-bodied on the palate with just a hair too much sharp zest.. serviceable. 6 2 6 3 11
Rock Bottom Chicago Rooftop Pilsner;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Chicago;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear gold color. Head was white with good retention.

To cap it off there was a touch of hop bitterness at the end. Tasty pilsner.

Middle Ages Swallow Wit;Syracuse, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Bottle supermarket grab for 4th festivities. Dirty brownish gold. Nosenis light yeast and citrus. Tastes light orange peel, yeats, earthy, cardboard. Easy drinking nothing special
Middle Ages Swallow Wit;Syracuse, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Pours cloudy golden yellow with a white fluffy head, last quite awhile, the aroma is spicy, yeast, malty, bread, and detergent. The flavor is pilsner like with a wheat upfront flavor and small floral/citrus notes, infront of that is some caramel and slight sweetness. overall easy drinking but bland, nothing that really says come back and have another.

Middle Ages Swallow Wit;Syracuse, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;I poured a 12oz bottle into a wheat beer glass. There was no freshness date. It cost $2.40 ($0.20 per ounce). Appearance: Gold, glowing yellow hue. On the clearer side with only slight cloudiness and plenty of effervescent visible. Forms an average size, white, soapy head which mostly dissipates and leaves minor lacing. Smell: A slightly grainy aroma more often found in lagers or cream ales. A hint of lemon, but not particularly aromatic. Taste: Middle Ages Swallow Wit is one of those beers that starts out well enough but begins to slowly lose me the more I drink. I’m not a stickler for styles, but this doesn’t represent the witbier style all that well, it’s more of a Kolsch or some kind of generic blonde ale. Beers of this style tend to have orange and spice, but this is more of a clean, mild palette of pale grain with some lemony taste. There’s little bitterness, which makes it quite refreshing while in the mouth, but I want way more flavor than I’m getting here. I wouldn’t go so far as to describe this as watery or bland as it definitely has some flavor, even if that flavor may be rather boring. An inoffensive beer to be sure, but has to ways to go to garner a thumbs up from me. Drinkability: While Middle Ages Swallow Wit may not be all that tasty, at least it’s an easy beer to drink. The mouthfeel is on the thinner side with some crisp carbonation throughout and a clean aftertaste. It’s refreshing across the tongue which makes it useful as a summer seasonal. At only 4.8% ABV it’s got the lighter weight you want in a beer of the type, though I’d prefer a bigger body with more flavor.
Middle Ages Swallow Wit;Syracuse, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;The beer was lightly carbonated with a smooth finish. Simple beer with a simple taste.
Middle Ages Swallow Wit;Syracuse, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Poured into a pint glass. 3.0 A: Clear medium yellow color. One and a half fingers of frothy white head. Retention is a little worse than average and no lacing is left. 4.0 S: Big grassiness that smells great. Corriander, hay, and a nonspecific spiciness. Simple, yet pleasant and quite satisfying. 3.5 T: Taste is closely similar to the nose, but it doesn’t satisfy quite as much for whatever reason. Corriander, wet grass and hay, spice. It’s not complex, but it is flavorful. 3.5 M: Lighter body. Good moderate carbonation. Light creaminess. Good enough. 3.0 D: Tasty, easy drinking beer. I want a little more, but I’m happy enough with what I got. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 08-01-2012 04:04:19
Middle Ages Swallow Wit;Syracuse, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;My wife brought this one back from a trip to Rochester. +++ Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a bright golden color with an enormous foamy yellow-white head that left minimal lacing. The aroma was strong lemon - tart and spritzy and resembling a cleaning product. The flavor was tart lemon, chalk and a touch of must. Medium length finish of tart lemon and chalk and turning dry at the end. Exceptionally overcarbonated. Ok.

Color negro intenso con espuma beige oscuro que desaparece al poco tiempo casi por completo. Sabores intensos maltosos y cereales tostados con buena dosis de cacaos, algo de café y muy agradable sensación de maderas empapadas y bourbon quedando al final maderas quemadas y ligeramente carbonizados. Cuerpo intenso con buena sensación alcohólica desde el principio y bastante sabor, se esperaba algo más densa, se bebe bien, casi demasiado bien. Bastante buena para repetir sin duda alguna. Cervezon.
Central Waters Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Central Waters Brewing Co.;"Dark brown, almost black. Brownish white head, two fingers, good retention, some lacing. Some carbonation when exposed to the light. In fact, it's rather fizzy in mouth -this does not fit the style but doesn't disturb me-. After a while, it's oilier. Nose shows lots of vanilla beans, rich bourbon, chocolate, treacle, wet oak. Taste is almost the same with lots of rich bourbon giving impressions of vanilla beans, chocolate and treacle; dried fruits, fudge, wet oak. Almost sweet with a good dose of bourbon at the end. Can't find any roasted notes, so this could pass as a Strong Ale. Hot in aftertaste because of the alcohol -which is well integrated but gives an impression of spicy heat mixed with boozy notes-. Lots of heavy bourbon in aftertaste. Tasty, good one. I like this profile. Would like to know which bourbon barrels they've used."
Central Waters Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Central Waters Brewing Co.;Pitch black color.

Greenfield Jabeths Bitter;Greenfield, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greenfield Brewery;A pale amber best bitter. Very rustic malt aroma with sulphur undertones. I can’t say I noticed the claimed hop profile, and I’m sure I would have done, so I think the beer wasn’t perfectly conditioned. The flavour is much better developed than the aroma, with some hop notes coming through, but this is a rather soft beer. I prefer more grip. Cask (gravity), Cambridge Beer Festival
Greenfield Jabeths Bitter;Greenfield, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greenfield Brewery;"Bright bottled at Cambridge Fest. Notes on the fresh sample: ""Amber. Potent aroma - wild nettles and a handful of pale malt before brewing. Slightly sharp mouthfeel with flavours echoing aroma. Quite foamy. Not my thing. Score 2.4"" Aroma is the same, though less potent and with a gentle touch of hop fragrance. Mouthfeel is more gentle and rounded with a pleasant sweetness, though the whole thing feels as though it’s not been fully brewed - there’s a raw, undeveloped feel. Mellow is one word I’ve come across to describe Greenfield’s beers, but this is a strange, uncomfortable mellow. Having said all that, with more time to experience this brew, it does come over as quite drinkable and a bit better quality than I first thought."

Copper Crow Alt! Who goes there?;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Crow Beer Company;Tap @ General Lafayette.

Copper Crow Alt! Who goes there?;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Crow Beer Company;"Draught pint with Dickinsonbeer at the brewpub on 10/6/06 Interesting appearance on most of their beers. Rather short-lived head, rapidly fizzling away, though it leaves a fair amount of spotty/sticky lacing as it recedes. The beers are all well-conditioned and quite clear, though you can tell only lightly filtered. This one is a deep mahogany with lighter magenta and peach tints when held to the light. The head is light beige in color. Very minimal aroma, plenty of sourdough notes; toasty, highly attenuated medium malts and a fair amount of almost tannic dryness and acidity. Not overly yeasty, but there is some mineral nature to it and light earthiness. Hops are leafy, soily and rather diluted. Warming produces some faint chocolate sweetness, but it is still stretched very lean across the grainy/toasty, super-attenuated malts. A high amount of water to malt ratio is notable immediately, being rather wet in the mouth, and the dryness from the nose is very present in the flavor, the malts being lean, highly attenuated and rather acidic/astringent. Some phenol extraction, very light coffee or chocolate with some very minimal yeast-like mineral character on the end. Low carbonation, very light body and just too much toastiness/sourdough without the necessary balancing sweetness/softness of more malt. Hops are again dry, soily and earthy, with a touch of boisterous red fruits emerging upon warming, but otherwise quite muted. No alcohol present."
Copper Crow Alt! Who goes there?;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Crow Beer Company;"Draught at Brewery: No aroma at all. Poured copper in color.

Copper Crow Alt! Who goes there?;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Copper Crow Beer Company;Crystal clear deep rusty amber body with a creamy head. Aroma of toasted bread crusts, toffee, and plums, plus a light pleasant phenolic clove note. Very nice malt character with notable Noble hop signatures. Flavor has a toasty, grainy edge and substantial dry bitterness. Medium-light body with some palatable residual unfermentables. A solid altbier, but doesn’t present the complexities of Uerige Sticke, for example.

Texas Cattle Golden Wheat;Macon, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;One of the most drab wheats I’ve ever had. No clove, no banana, no spice at all. Not even a hint of lemon for chrissakes! Head was virtually non-existent. This beer might suffice on a hot golf course or fishing boat, but if I’m sitting down at a bar I want to TASTE my beer. I tasted very little in this one.
Texas Cattle Golden Wheat;Macon, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;Rerate 7/25/06: Seems to lack the probable infection of my first trip, but it still doesn’t seem quite right. Green apple, perhaps a little diacetyl. 6/12/05: After the drinkable Texas Lite, this was kind of a letdown. The Lite had more flavor and that’s sad. A weird brownish yellow body, very hazy with no head. The aroma is very faint and almost no flavor except a weird aftertaste and maybe a bit of green apple. Really unappetizing.
Texas Cattle Golden Wheat;Macon, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;To sum it up, lifeless - did nothelp much that the sample was served in plastic juice glasses.

Texas Cattle India Pale Ale;Macon, Georgia, United States;IPA;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;Pours a gold body with a small head. A touch cidery. Possibly extract beer (I can’t tell if the equipment is more than a pour and stir, and that might be the brewery’s problem. Almost no hop aroma or flavor.
Texas Cattle India Pale Ale;Macon, Georgia, United States;IPA;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;When I stopped in and ordered the IPA (my favorite style), the bartender wanted me to sample it first. After the first sip, I knew why. He claimed that there was a yeast problem. It was a recipe and contamination problem. No hop aroma or bitterness in the beer. Diacetyl all over the place. Nothing like an IPA, unless you made it with a Mr. Beer kit. Why serve a bad batch of beer? At least the food and service was good.
Texas Cattle India Pale Ale;Macon, Georgia, United States;IPA;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;If I would’ve taken a blind taste test of this beer I would never have guessed that I was drinking an IPA. Being an IPA-quaffin’ hop head, this was truly a disappointment for me... and I’m from Macon. Okay, for those bent on hearing the specifics here goes: color had a decent (though not rich) tawny, coppery hue. Head was almost non-existent, but that could’ve been from the bartender’s piss-poor pour as I’m sure most of his customers prefer their beer cold and decapitated. Taste was the biggest buzz kill of all: very little hoppiness, lots of sloppiness. An IPA with virtually no hop bite? Need I say more?
Texas Cattle India Pale Ale;Macon, Georgia, United States;IPA;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;Mild hoppy aroma. Dry, peppery without much fruit. Medium hopping, mild ale flavor. A bit woody without much going on. Medium light PA appearance.

Dragonmead Dragon Daze Hemp Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Dragonmead Brewery;First off let me say that I am disapointed by Dragonmeads brews at the present. I have gotten the impression that with the prices of their ingredients going sky high, they have cut back on the quantity of their ingredients in their brews. The end result is much weaker than usual brews. The aromas and flavors all appeared weak IMHO. With that said, on to the rating. This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a softly carbonated brown colored body. The almost non-existant aroma was brown malt and nutty. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start mediumly tingly at the finish. The mild flavor contained notes of nutty and brown malt. Not one that I would likely buy again.

The looks of the eer are nice. Golden yellow coloured beer, slightly hazy, and nice white soft almost creamy head. It looks like a proper Tripel. The aroma of the beer is fine. It is a typical Triple. Nothing to special to be honest. Malts give some plain grainy notes. There might be a hint of honey somewhere. Hops give some herbal notes, but also some clearly floral hop notes. Yeast gives some banana esters and some spicy notes. All in all, a typical Triple, but nothing too special The taste of the beer is also fine but nothing to special. Sweet malts, bitter hops and some interesting yeast notes. Balanced, but not 100% harmonious. The palate of the beer is fine. Medium body, quite smooth and very slightly creamy texture and medium carbonation.

Russian River OVL Stout;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Russian River Brewing;Backlog, sampled on tap in Sonoma. Pours a dark brown color with a small beige head.

Russian River OVL Stout;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Russian River Brewing;July 27th, 2015 - Onwards to the dark thimbles on the Russian River cornucopia taster banquet. The OVL stout collects a nice head, with a scaled pattern along the edge of the glass, and a light cocoa powder scent. The palate is surprisingly thin, and the flavor disappoints, with a soil style flavor palate, but thin and bitter.

I bought this from a little van selling various crap beers from around the world; why do I do that when there were so many fresh beers on tap all around me? Anyway this is a golden, pale looking brew that gave a small white head on pouring. More malty than hoppy in both the aroma and taste, metallic twang as it warms in the glass, not a beer I could recommend to anybody."

Dieu du Ciel! Ciel Étoilé;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Un liquide mi rose mi orange. Un mousse peu abondante qui laisse tout de même de jolies dentelles sur mon verre. Un nez qui me rappelle plus une tisane à l’anis étoilé qu’une bière. Peu ou pas de céréale ni de houblons perceptibles jusqu’à présent. C’est très végétal, herbacé et aromatique. Ça sent mon garde-manger. Liquide très mince et moyennement pétillant. Je suis maintenant entre la tisane et le thé vert. C’est feuillu. L’étoile de badiane occupe 99% du spectre aromatique. Je sens maintenant en bouche une céréale blanche. Du riz? Du blé? Je crois que c’est du blé, mais celui-ci réclame l’anonymat. Moyennement longue en bouche, cette bière manque de profondeur et de complexité certes, elle est loin d’être mauvaise ou déplaisante.
Dieu du Ciel! Ciel Étoilé;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Une robe presque cuivrée. Un mince anneau de mousse. Un nez frais et doux de feuilles et de graines d’anis vert. Un goût franchement épicé et sec. Beaucoup d’anis mais aussi de la muscade et autres aromatiques qui partagent les mêmes molécules. Une bouche un peu mince avec une texture légèrement huileuse. Une finale plutôt sèche sur des notes herbeuses et finement poivrées. Intéressante concoction lorsque servie dans un verre de 5 onces.

Nez assez épicé (anis, notes de gingembre et de muscade), légèrement malté de caramel doux, léger de houblon herbeux avec des notes de pain. Moyennement ronde en bouche avec un pétillement moyen et une texture aux notes crémeuses. Goût épicé (anis, notes de muscade et de coriandre, traces de gingembre) accompagné de faibles notes fruitées (agrumes) lors de l’entrée en bouche auquel se rajoute un léger goût malté de caramel doux avec un léger goût de pain puis en finale le goût épicé revient en avant plan avec un ajout de petites notes poivrées ainsi qu’une légère amertume de houblon herbeux. Post-goût moyen et aux notes sèches, très légèrement amer de houblon herbeux avec un goût épicé (anis). (hiver 2006-07)
Dieu du Ciel! Ciel Étoilé;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;On tap at DDC. Hazy dark amber with off-tan head. Nutmeg, anise, all spice, malt and grain. Very carbonated, slightly bitter, nutmeg, dry but just not my thing.
Dieu du Ciel! Ciel Étoilé;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Draught at Dieu du Ciel brewpub. Pours a slightly hazy gold with an average size white head. Aroma: Whoa, you gotta like anise(!), it’s pretty much just that backed by sweet malt -- I’m not loving it, but if you love anise it’s well done. Flavour’s the same, too much anise for my liking but that’s a personal preference and not a knock on the beer.Well done (for some).
Dieu du Ciel! Ciel Étoilé;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;"Draught - April 22, 2009 - at Dieu du Ciel. Slightly hazy amber-gold with an average off-white head. Aroma is a little bit of grain and a LOT of aniseed. Tasted a bit stronger than 5% - the was dryness I attributed to a hint of booziness - a weak light sweet malt backbone with tons of aniseed, a little spicy maybe. Sticky, lightly carbonated - but what the heck, they were aiming for a beer tasting like aniseed and they got it. ""it’s o-KAY, but you sure as fuck better like aniseed!"""
Dieu du Ciel! Ciel Étoilé;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;On tap at DDC. Appearance: golden brown, small white head, a little visible carbonation.

Dieu du Ciel! Ciel Étoilé;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;1/18/08 notes: on tap DdC. Pours a hazy golden color, similar to wheat beers. Nose of heavy spices, wheat, and hops. Flavor filled with herbs, grain, rye and some sweetness. I felt that this intense use of spices was a bit overwhelming, but certainly not short on flavor or fullness. Very interesting overall, would try again . . . this is just a well done, spicy wheat beer.

Dieu du Ciel! Ciel Étoilé;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Cloudy orange body topped by a long-lasting small creamy white head. Body is rather full and oily. Orange pulp flavour and ginger flavours upfront along with various herbal spices. Doughy malts/yeast. The advertised anise is there but more herbal spices flavours joinded in along the way. Hints of ginseng, coriander, nutgmeg and white not some white pepper. Interesting and different. I liked the Starry Night (Ciel Étoilé). I liked it almost as much a real starry night, when I lay in my bed looking at the beautiful stars thinking to myself, I really need to fix that roof.

Southampton May Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Southampton Publick House;Aroma is bready, vegetable, honey. The appearance is reddish gold, persistent white head, slighly hazy. The flavor is caramel, hoey, bread, vegetable. More sweet than not. The finish has a light yet astringent hop bittering, left on the palate. The mouthfeel is medium, slick. Decent maibock. I’m glad I got to try this tonight, as the month of May is almost over.
Southampton May Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Southampton Publick House;Tap at Barcade: Orange pour with good clarity and a fading white head. Very sweet malt aroma- honey soaked bread and caramelized Munich malts. Average palate- slick with prickly peppery notes. Honeyish flavor- too sweet- lacking the softness of German Maibocks. Bready & sweet with some peppery alcohol and a touch of noble hop bitterness, but it doesn’t blend cohesively with the under attenuated body. Just another overly sweet American Maibock.
Southampton May Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Southampton Publick House;On tap at SPH. Pours a clear orange with a small white head. Aroma of sweet, corny malt, sweet apple, and sorghum. Flavor of pale lager malts up front with a sweet fruity finish. Decent, but palate is a little thin. 7/4/7/3/14 (3.5/5)
Southampton May Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Southampton Publick House;Tap at SPH. Aroma of bready malt with some red fruits, notably raspberry. Flavor the same, not at all complex, but solid bready malt with some fruitiness that is kept in check and not let to run wild into pure sweetness. Tasty for what it is, but not transcendent.
Southampton May Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Southampton Publick House;Orange golden color with a fluffy head. Aroma of malt and a hint of spice and bread.

Southampton May Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Southampton Publick House;"Crystal clear orange coloured body with light golden tints with no head at all. Aroma of alcohol, light malt and some apricots. Light-bodied; Decent malt flavour with not much else. Some yeast and a bit of sugars - but fairly bland, all in all. Aftertaste clean and pure, no complexity. Overall, not great and not worth trying - far substandard compared to other Southampton beers. Pass this one up unless you love to try all Mai Bocks! I sampled this 65 cL bottle purcased from K&E Discount Beverage in New Paltz, New York on 06-August-2006."

Big River Grille Espresso Stout;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Black, or if not black then at least very brown.

Big River Grille Espresso Stout;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Appearance: Served up a dark brown, near black body crowned with a half inch-high layer of beige foam. Smell: The nose is reasonably diverse, though nothing about it is particularly bold, as it presents only modest notes of coffee, charred bread crusts, chocolate, and caramel. Taste: Unsweetened chocolate powder with a slackened taste of roasted grains followed by a charge of espresso flavor and buttery caramel. Slender hint of dark fruitiness. Minor, predominately roasty bitterness. Light chocolate and coffee tones on the finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied (just barely). Medium carbonation (again, just barely). Drinkability: Not so bad, but, by no means is it the best. Still, it’s worth signing up for a pint when stopping by the Chattanooga location.

Braidwood Best Bitter;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Braidwood Brewery;bottled. weirdo lychee compost aroma. hazy amber, very fizzy, some orchard syrup floavours and chemical nastiness and zero bitterness
Braidwood Best Bitter;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Braidwood Brewery;Preparing for a Braidwood gusher I opened this one over the sink, but I needn’t have worried as it was perfectly benign. It poured quite well leaving a big foamy off-white head over a hazy pale brown fluid. Peppery apple aroma which on tasting makes it like a dodgy extract homebrew. The carbonation explodes in the mouth making it really hard to discern the flavours, which was bitterness and a bit sour (but without much acidity if that is possible?). Well I’m now 1 from 3 with the Braidwood beers, with the 2 being terribly over carbonate making it a chore to drink. Looks like I’ll have to make a trip down there one day to get a good sample.

Braidwood Best Bitter;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Braidwood Brewery;Bottled. A bit overcarbonated, but a good, honest, strong bitter flavour with a good mouthfeel despite the bubbles. Unfortunate about the slight, sulphurous home-brew aroma and aftertaste though.
Braidwood Best Bitter;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Braidwood Brewery;Bottled. Hazy pale yellow. Flowery band aid aroma. Medium bodied with dense, soft malt character and some hay likes hops. Medium bitterness. Has potential, but the extreme flowery flavour, reminiscent of a homebrew fermented at too high temperatures, takes over.
Braidwood Best Bitter;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Braidwood Brewery;Disappointing fizzy bottle-conditioned bitter from country NSW. Appearance: quick and messy. Spurted everywhere before I got a glass under it. Caramel colour, huge rocky head that left clumpy lace. Peculiar aroma: light and spritzy for the style, with odd sulphurous notes and a hint of fruity hops. The mouthfeel is fizzy and champagne-like. Thin body. There’s some fruitiness in there but it’s dominated by a metallic bitterness that’s faint but objectionable. No ’best before’ date on the bottle, so I’ve no idea how fresh this is. However, Camperdown Cellars are pretty reliable. (Bottle)
Braidwood Best Bitter;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Braidwood Brewery;Bottle. Yes, it is too fizzy for the style, but it also lacks flavour. Very thin mouthfeel, some hints of hops in here. I kept tasting chlorine for some reason. I’m sorry for my lack of descriptive analysis in this review, but there isn’t much i can say about it.
Braidwood Best Bitter;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Braidwood Brewery;Much better the second time around (last tasted in October 2004). Vibrant cloudy orange - looks really good. Fruit nose, quite varietal but a slight metallic note hangs in the background. Ok in the mouth, malts are a little faint but good bitterness. Just a bit too fizzy for the style.

Belle-Vue Kriekenlambik;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Belle-Vue (AB InBev);"The basis for the commercial Belle-Vue fruit beers, at least that is what they claim (I have a spontaneous distrust towards claims made by large industrial breweries). The pinkishly orange colour seems to give away the fact that colorants are added later in the process to arrive at Belle-Vue Kriek; aroma and taste hardly reveal any krieks at all. Fruity lambic yeastiness is present abudantly though, as well as a soft lactic acidity; gentle basic character (’malse lambiek’). Contrary to the other kriekenlambics I’ve had, and I’ve had them from every Belgian lambic brewery, this one seems to contain only a very limited percentage of sour cherries, if any at all. It was nevertheless an interesting experience gaining access to the basic lambic of the most industrial brewery of them all."

Gambrinus Vollbier Hell;Oberhaid-Unterhaid, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Gambrinusbräu Unterhaid;Mild taste, hops, nothing outstanding, just a normal beer. I was told that this was the most popular beer in Prague, but after drinking it I wondered if this was really true.
Gambrinus Vollbier Hell;Oberhaid-Unterhaid, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Gambrinusbräu Unterhaid;Draught at the brewpub as Gambrinusbräu Kellerbier. Grassy hop aroma. Hazy golden colour. Small white head. The flavour has a little of the grassy hoppiness as the aroma, quite uncommon in a German beer. Good malt body. Cleansing bitterness in the finish along with more grass flavour.
Gambrinus Vollbier Hell;Oberhaid-Unterhaid, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Gambrinusbräu Unterhaid;The owner pulled a tap beer specially for me in a pot stopper bottle, so that I could taste it at home. It only lasted until Würgau, where I tasted it in my hotel room. Golden color. Malty aroma and flavor with some hop presence. Barnyard aroma and flavor, even a bit sulphury. Typical hells from a very small Franconian brewery. It’s not clean, but there is always something interesting in the flavor that makes tasting worthwile.
Fössel Välta Landbier;Appendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei-Gasthaus Fößel-Mazour;Draft at the brewpub in June 2013: Russet orange. Fluffy, broken foam. Extremely foul aroma of yogurty yeast, diacetyl, gummy candy, metal, Turkish apricot, raisin, and prominent alcohol. Soft carbonation. Flabby mouthfeel. Leathery, pecan-skin maltiness yields to an intrusive metallic twang. Underattenuated to the point of being medicinal, with a high concentration of sugars obscuring the hop bitterness. Quite worty, as well. Some cottony astringency is apparent as well as trace levels of diacetyl. Vague, poorly defined malt is worsened by the soupy mouthfeel, limp cola sugars, and soggy toasted bread in the very wet and dirty finish. A very drab and muddled example that makes you just scratch your head at how such limited amount of care seemed to go into making this. Just plain offensive. And why the hell am I finding raisin notes in my kellerbier??? No.
Fössel Välta Landbier;Appendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei-Gasthaus Fößel-Mazour;Draft at the brewery in Appendorf. Lightly hazed rich amber body with a large-bubbled, splotchy head. Yeasty vaccuum cleaner dust, metal flakes, dirt and food in the aroma. Sweet and acidic with a resemblance to malt vinegar. Low hop aroma, low bitterness, sourish black licorice, herbal moss and basement must. Acidic but flimsy finish. Very bad shape. I saw the braumeister, he was 85, his hands were shaking. How much could he really be doing in the brewhouse?

Stadter Landbier;Aufseß-Sachsendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Stadter;Draught at the brewpub on Aug. 13, 2014: Clear rust. Creamy pasty white head. Simple nose of tobacco, pecan, toast and woody Spalt. Mild notes of plummy esters, breadcrust, and toffee. Soft, relaxed carbonation. Sweetly malty with an ensuing rusticity of fallen leaves and an underlying metallic and fruity twang. Much of the herbal hop bitterness is regrettably enshrouded by the esters, and the relative absence of minerals doesn’t help to breakup the fruity slickness, although a salvaging breadcrusty grip and sharp earthiness do emerge later. Finishes with a muted dab of woody, herbal, licorice-tinged bitterness and hop-echoing notes of leaf decay. In the right ballpark of appealing earth and toast, but just doesn’t quite come together primarily due to the semi-flabby body, mediocre malt structure and subtle metallic notes. A beer like this begs for some melanoidins and malty succuelnce, but ultimately it plays things pretty safe. Not bad.

Okells IPA (Bottled);Douglas, Isle of Man;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Okells;A relative bitter but tasty IPA from the Isle of Man. A good beer with little complexity but the hops are good and it has remarkably little alcohol for an IPA. A beer that certainly wets the appetite for more IPAs.

Mad Anthony Java Porter;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Porter - Flavored;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Draft @ MABC: Pours a jet black with some mahogany around the edges and a medium-sized tan head. Immediately the coffee hits upon the glass arriving, notes of dark malts and an underlying bitter dark chocolate come in to the fold but this is mainly all about the coffee. Medium-full bodied mouth feel, perfectly carbonated. Flavor is all dark malts and coffee with some subtle chocolate flavors lingering. Good stuff and another solid brew from MABC.

It had a mild malty aroma with a mouth feel that was nicely tingly at the start with a nice hoppy note and a finish of mild coffee aftertaste. The flavor was a nice mix of mild coffee dark malt and hops.

Mr Whitehead's Newtons Discovery Cider;Alton, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;Mr Whitehead's Cider;330ml bottle. Part of a Christmas gift pack. Pale yellow and cloudy. Apple and lime, quite a citrus taste for a cider. Probably an acquired taste as I started to enjoy this a bit too late. Quite strange.

Mr Whitehead's Boxing Dog Cider;Alton, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;Mr Whitehead's Cider;500ml bottle (Poseidon, Helsinki) Fairly fresh apple aroma. Not jumping out of the glass at all. Pale, hazy, fizzy carbonation. Crisp palate, but a bit watery. Dry and yeasty. This has the same problem as the malmgaard earlier, it’s super dry, but too yeasty. No gonna DP a proper cider, but this will probably ruin my morning. This just doesn’t have the scrumpy fruity notes that I like. Not full enough with the fruit, too much is the yeast.

Mr Whitehead's Boxing Dog Cider;Alton, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;Mr Whitehead's Cider;Drank at this brilliant beer and cider festival under the arches in Stockport. Good company, good band who rocked the place, Stockport ukelele band which was mellow, weird and ace. The cider looked a bit pissy, apples and stuff. Was very drunk by this time but I know it’s not bad. That’s about all I know.
Mr Whitehead's Boxing Dog Cider;Alton, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;Mr Whitehead's Cider;500ml bottle from Kris Wines. Pours pale yellow with floral aroma. Doesn’t half pack a punch on first sip, quite a big tang followed by fleshy sweet apples and vanilla essence on the finish. Lots of taste here that grows as you work through. Not bad.
Mr Whitehead's Boxing Dog Cider;Alton, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;Mr Whitehead's Cider;From cask at Bon Accord. Pours hazy pale yellow. Dry aplles, yeasty and light white wine. Dry, light tart and appleish. Dry and light tart finish.

Braidwood Milk Stout;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Braidwood Brewery;Obviously this beer is very inconsistent, with some very different experiences had. I think my bottle was pretty close to the mark. It poured deep black with a full and lasting head. Roasted aroma, with that creamy but watery milk stout character. On tasting there is more of that, with the lactose sweetness seeming to come more at the bottom of the glass (although it may have just taken me that long to get saturated with it. Slightly overcarbonated, but with a solid body for a beer of this abv. Decent and worthwhile, but not one to get too excited about.
Braidwood Milk Stout;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Braidwood Brewery;Wow this beer is over carbonated and it affects the taste as well. Good aroma to start with of roasted espresso. Small tan head and dark but no totally opaque colour. On first sip the carbonation just slams you. Makes it hard to taste much. Some espresso taste, interesting sweet/sour effect from the lactose but disappointing.
Braidwood Milk Stout;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Braidwood Brewery;Heavy malt sweet aroma. Black dark brown colour over primed good head. Sweet malt flavour. Smooth palate.
Braidwood Milk Stout;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Braidwood Brewery;Black,beige head. Aroma of coffee with cream. Sweet and light bodied with soft mouthfeel and notes of chocolate. Drier finish. Stunningly similar to the famous Maltese Farson’s Milk Stout, but more well made. Good to see someone actually attempting a low abv milk stout again.
Braidwood Milk Stout;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Braidwood Brewery;Damn this beer must travel real real well to Japan. I had this at a sampling with BA guys and this and Freeminer Shaft Stout came out as the clear winner amongst 10 beers. Dark brown head, pitch black color. Solid dark chocolates notes with caramel and a touch of nuttiness. Starts slightly tart, with dark chocolate, cherries, dark fruit and nuts. A bitter dark chocolate finish. WOW for 3.2% this stuff has complexity. My favourite Aussie beer.
Braidwood Milk Stout;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Braidwood Brewery;Flawed milk stout from regional NSW. It was the first of their beers that didn’t look over-carbonated (the other two were gushers). Poured black with a 2cm tan head that showed good length and some lace. Aroma initially seemed right - dark malt, chocolate ice cream, etc - but it developed nasty farmyard characteristics - silage and cattle manure. Thin, fizzy mouthfeel - it may not look overcarbonated but it sure tastes that way. Mild flavour initially - milky coffee with plenty of sugar - but with a creeping sourness. Dry finish with metallic tendencies. This stuff gives you really foul burps - you could stop a charging rhino with one. (350ml bottle, no best before)
Braidwood Milk Stout;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Braidwood Brewery;Pours quite dark. Big head initially but settles down very quickly. Maintains a good thin creamy layer however. Reasonable roast on the nose, a little smokey. Palate is ok, some more classic roasted notes and malt but is a little thin and metallic. Finishes quite dry. Just doesn’t have the body and weight I was expecting.
Braidwood Milk Stout;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Braidwood Brewery;Dissappointingly thin for such a dark beer with decent head and promising aroma. Light roasted flavour on the tongue soon gets washed away with a sweet watery finish.
Braidwood Milk Stout;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Braidwood Brewery;NFOB 2004 - Looked great. Aroma was big on the usual toasted/roasted/burnt notes. I think my tastebuds may have been getting the same way after tasting too many stouts in the one sitting. However the thin body and slightly oily mouthfeel detracted from an otherwise reasonable stout.
Braidwood Milk Stout;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Braidwood Brewery;I was very worried about this beer after my experience at AIBA (all their beers tasted nasty and infected) but was pleasantly surprised. Highly carbonated which was a concern but it wasn’t infected. After letting it sit for a while, the beer was an opaque black colour with a nice tight tan head. Nice chocolaty aroma with some malted milk and a hint of instant coffee. Flavour is distinctly like a cafe latte with about three sugars - not really my style but it kind of grew on me. Thin mouthfeel and the lactose is a bit of a turnoff but the roastiness just sneaks back in at the end to balance it out. I generally detest milk stouts (Mackeson’s and Sweetheart both nearly made me vomit) but this wasn’t too bad.
Braidwood Old Doc;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Old Ale;Braidwood Brewery;A muddy cherry red look. Medicinal with overtones of cough syrup and coal tar. The alcoholic content was not that pronounced. Not too good.
Braidwood Old Doc;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Old Ale;Braidwood Brewery;probably not the smartest choice of a beer to take along to a barbie on a hot afternoon. looked alright - brown with a purple tinge. very scary aroma - vomitous, surgical, some rotting flesh. actually didn’t taste as disgusting as expected, just some dull bockish malt character and bad homebrew flavour
Braidwood Old Doc;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Old Ale;Braidwood Brewery;9 May 2005 Sweet some simple roasted malt hop aromas. Reminds me of old home brew. Cloudy dark brown colour, brown head. Simple roasted malt flavour. Bitter finish, thin fruitarty lingering roast malt. A bit simplistic. I can make a better beeer.
Braidwood Old Doc;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Old Ale;Braidwood Brewery;Aroma: pineapple/plums and a little carbon. Appearance: dark red/brown with a tan head. Flavour: mochery & a little carbon. Palate: thin but clean drinking. Overall: it smells and tastes different.
Braidwood Old Doc;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Old Ale;Braidwood Brewery;Bottled. Hazy mahogany colour, rich head Extreme flowery band aid aroma. Sweet and medicinal with medium body and clean, rounded mouthfeel. Low bitterness . The flaws from the best bitter is here exaggerated and completely takes over.
Braidwood Old Doc;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Old Ale;Braidwood Brewery;thick malt aroma. Dark borwn black colour with good head that lingers. Rich malt flavour. Thick palate.
Braidwood Old Doc;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Old Ale;Braidwood Brewery;Looks very good - nice deep brown-red colour with good head retention. Solid looking beer. Loads of plastic aroma with varnish, rough chocolate malt, false teeth lollies and dirt. Muddy apricot and malt flavour, with more plastic and cocoa powder, followed by a big, rough roasty, bitter and VERY alcoholic finish. It’s very rough, though not entirely unpleasant. Far too much alcohol character, though it’s rather watery at the same time. It’s a massive improvement over how it tasted at AIBA last year at least.
Braidwood Old Doc;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Old Ale;Braidwood Brewery;"Not at all unlike a very dodgy Patagonian ""bock"" I once had (see Bodegon Negra) except without the bits floating in it. It has the right ingredients, some choc flavour, a little roasty complexity but it completely loses out to a bit of dodgy sourness that has turned the mouthfeel rather watery. I didn’t get any of the cough mixture flavour and wasn’t sufficiently repulsed to pour it down the drain, so I guess it aint all bad."
Braidwood Old Doc;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Old Ale;Braidwood Brewery;This will get some points for appearance and presentation, just because a beer of this deep dark presence looks damn fine in a glass. Regrettably that is where the good news ends. This smells and tastes like a bad post-mix soft drink, sort of like that whacko sarsparilla that Queenslanders like. This is an all malt extract into which the brewer must have spilled some cough mixture, hence the name. All I can say is that this brewery is consistent, a very sad thing as no-one wants to knock new brewers who are trying to break the mould, but end up with fermenting with one instead.
Braidwood Old Doc;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Old Ale;Braidwood Brewery;"Sampled AIBA 2004. Whoo the first rating. Pity it is not going to be a good one. This beer just smelled and tasted diabolical. One where you just say ""that’s awful"" straight away. Possibly infected, not what you want to present at any beer awards. Thanks to whoever added this brewery because I would not have bothered."
Braidwood Ruby Mild;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Braidwood Brewery;Aroma: cherries, Appearance: clear red with a small head. Flavour: lightly sour cherries. Palate: lightly carbonated but medium to full mouthfeel.
Braidwood Ruby Mild;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Braidwood Brewery;Well, it seems like these Braidwood beers are a bit of a lottery. After getting a stable bottle of the milk stout, I was hoping for another one with this. Unfortunately it was way too overcarbonated - not a gusher but it froths up enormously on pouring, and also as soon as it hits the mouth. It’s a lovely opaque deep brown with that excessively frothy beige head on top. It’s not too bad on the nose with some caramel malt and some appley bbq sauce. On tasting it’s a different story though. It’s full of metallic bitterness, the alcohol is too volatile and raw, and the froth and carbonation make it an unpleasant drinking experience. It’s really disappointing that what could be a very decent beer turns into a lottery, and that is something that the brewer really needs to work on.
Braidwood Ruby Mild;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Braidwood Brewery;"Bottled. Had none of the overfizzing issues I’ve had with other Braidwood beers or that others complain about. No way this is a mild, it packs way too much flavour - doesn’t seem like a brown to me either. Red colour, fruity tastes at first with some toasted woodiness, like nice hardwood burning on a campfire, creamy palate - reminiscent of a red ale. Hold on though - in creeps a big burnt malt flavour, caramel/toffee tones and fairly heavy feeling finish - it’s gone stout! So... a ""red stout""? Is there such a thing? Whatever it really should be called, I liked it."
Braidwood Ruby Mild;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Braidwood Brewery;Bottle: Ok... I’ve just had to stand by the sink for 5 minutes while this bottle has fizzed up almost half of its contents... Lifeless looking hazy rust-amber with just about no head. Slightly sour, musty, fizzy caramel aromas with woody and herbal notes. Very dry, puckering toasty malts and fruity yeast notes (some hops too??). Firey and acidic (infected?). Bordering on vile.
Braidwood Ruby Mild;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Braidwood Brewery;bottled. pretty excitable. unpolished but with some pleasant caramel and red berry flavours. passable
Braidwood Ruby Mild;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Braidwood Brewery;Sweet malt aroma. Clear red brown colour with very very very overprimed head. Smooth sweet sour malt flavour. Smooth fizzy palate.
Braidwood Ruby Mild;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Braidwood Brewery;Second of the Braidwood range that I’ve tried and the second to gush everywhere on opening. The glass was 4/5ths head and took an eternity to settle, leaving islands of lace. Might score higher for Appearance if they sort out the carbonation. Ruby colour. Uninviting and thin homebrew aroma - yeast, prunes, a little alcohol. Too thin bodied for a mild. There’s some upfront apple fruitiness, a shot of warming alcohol and then the same metallic bitterness that ruins the Bitter - like sucking pocket change. The alcohol is clumsily prominent. Pretty crap, really. (Bottle, no apparent best before date)
Braidwood Ruby Mild;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Braidwood Brewery;NFOB 2004 - Reddish brown, light head, heavily sedimented. Very fruity aroma, monsterio, and light citrusy notes. Tart flavour, grainy, caramel maltyness, rich, monsterio fruityness, and a light earthy yeastyness.
Braidwood Ruby Mild;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Braidwood Brewery;7 May 2004 - Sampled AIBA 2004 - Simplistic stewed fruit aroma, clear dark red brown, headless, laceless. Slight fruit flavour and sweet, but flat. I'm in too generous a mood to rate it lower.
Braidwood Ruby Mild;Braidwood NSW, Australia;Brown Ale;Braidwood Brewery;I liked the look of this. Its taste though is a challenge because have not sampled anything like it previously. All in all not great but I found it a welcome change from the norm.
Shaftebury Four Twenty Brilliant Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;Can at Matt’s Blond color. Skunky aroma, stale, corn, no bitterness. Poor Lager.
Shaftebury Four Twenty Brilliant Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;355ml can @ Matt’s. Pours a clear golden colour with a thin white head. Nose is like stale beer with a boiled vegetables note that kind of makes my stomach turn. Flavour is bitter, soapy, and vegetables. I’m sorry, I just can’t drink this.
Shaftebury Four Twenty Brilliant Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;355mL can, pours a clear dull yellow with a small white head. Aroma is skunky as hell, with loads of cabbage, and lots of floral notes. Flavour is absolutely putrid, with boiled skunk cabbage and detergent. Absolutely disgusting.
Shaftebury Four Twenty Brilliant Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;355ml can. Gold, hazy, surprisingly large white cap. Nose has apple, lemon, caramel sweetness and yeast. Taste is caramel malts, apple, slight grain and honey. Sweet finish with a grassy note. Body feels heavy. Does not really come together for me... not a fan.
Shaftebury Four Twenty Brilliant Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;Better than average lager. Much better than macro’s if you like your lager a bit sweeter than average. Usually priced about 30% less than other macro & micro brews, so good for all seasons. Tolerated by the Bud/Coors groupies, so safe bet for all if hosting.
Shaftebury Four Twenty Brilliant Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;Très pale, très peu de mousse, l’arôme des céréales et un peu d’houblon. Facile à boire mais un peu timide.
Shaftebury Four Twenty Brilliant Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;Can pours a clear pale golden with a medium white head. Stale bready caramel malt and yeast aroma. Taste similar to aroma, watery with earthy veggies. Bad.
Shaftebury Four Twenty Brilliant Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;500 ml can. Clear golden yellow, fine white lasting foam. Buttery corny grainy lager malt aroma and taste and not much else. Average carbonation, light bodied, low hopped. One rung up. LF (Lagerboy Friendly)
Shaftebury Four Twenty Brilliant Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;Stick too their cream ale. This was pretty much a macro lager, minus the piss and metal taste. Has more of sweet corn taste, which is still not that nice. Not a great aftertaste, but not as bad as usual from macro lagers. I was living on a mountain so it worked.
Shaftebury Four Twenty Brilliant Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tree Brewing;Out of the can. I brought this with me all the way to Japan from Canada, but couldn't rightly trade or give this away given its rating, so I'm sitting outside of of Osaka Csstle having a break. This is sweet smelling, akin to an apple cider. There's also an aroma of lemon and a touch of funk. This is quite sweet, with grains and a touch of bitterness. Not a good beer, but still a slight nudge above the macros.
Groenen;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"Commissioned ale and one of very few really green beers I’ve had so far. Effectively grass green, like some vegetable juice, with loose, pale head with faintly greenish hue. Grainy aroma with lime, grass and plastic-like solvents as well as herbal hops; taste a bit fruity, bit thin, with a long, peppery hop finish but also phenolic, completely out of balance. Points for originality but I do not understand its taste."
Groenen;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Bottle 0,33ltr: Haevy hazy green coloured brew thats have a wheaty taste and i like this one, and why not an green beer.
Groenen;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Bottle, Delerium Café, Brussel, March 2005. Green, obviously, moderate white head and moderate condition. Gentle malt in the nose, slight hoppiness creeping ino the mouth and a gentle grainy finish. Bland and inoffensive, except for the colour which had no influence on the taste.
Groenen;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"weird green beer= artificial colorings; or is this natural... aroma: slightly citrussy, grainy, sweetish. taste: grainy, malty, sourrish, sweetish, plastic(chemical indeed). soapy, sticky mf, medium bodied. alcohol is well hidden(thats a plus). not very good."

Groenen;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Green colour with a white head. Sweet marzipan aroma and a sweet soap taste. Medium body and a sweet finish.
Groenen;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Clear green coloured, with even a faintly green-looking head. However, besides the unusual colour there is nothing special about this one. Some artificial sour fruity flavour with some sweetness and quite some alcohol. Not terribly bad, but not good either.
Groenen;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"Very clear, pale green with just a touch of yellow-amber shine; greenish tinted head. Faint lime-like nose, citrussy, tad grassy, not unlike some (alternative?) beauty-product. Awful mix of slightly sweet, lemonflavour, bitter, grain, alcohol, all clashing à go-go. There’s nothing wholesome about it - glimpses of everything and utter unbalance. Rather light bodied, with soapy feeling. Overall comment: utterly disgusting."
Groenen;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Bright green beer with a small head. Light hoppy and mybe some light vegetable aroma. The taste is slightly sweet and typical belgian. Quite good beer and the green colour is kind of cool.

Chapeau Abricot;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij De Troch;"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly crystal clear golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of juicy and lightly tart/tangy apricots, peach, pear, pineapple, mango, melon, red apple, honey, candi sugar, wheat, and bread; with light notes of hay, straw, grass, oak, funk, and yeast earthiness.

Light fruit tang/tartness on the finish. Lingering notes of apricots, peach, pear, pineapple, mango, melon, red apple, honey, candi sugar, wheat, bread, hay, straw, grass, light funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/light funky yeast, apricots, and pale malt/sugar sweetness; with a good malt/tartness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing tart/tangy fruit dryness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/syrupy/tangy balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.5%. Overall this is a very good sweetened fruit lambic style. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/light funky yeast, apricots, and pale malt/sugar sweetness; very smooth and refreshing to drink, with the mildly tart/tangy/drying finish. Big juicy fruit flavors and balanced sweetness; with a good mix of fruity yeast complexity, and a touch of funk. A very enjoyable offering. Met my expectations."

Chapeau Abricot;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij De Troch;Pours with weak foam. Carbonation is big. Color is a bit cloudy orange-pink. Aroma has dried apricot, fermentation, raspberry, some dried plum, lactic acid/sour beer aroma. Palate is a bit more oily than dry, but is almost well balanced. Bubbles are big and the carbonation feels sharp. Taste is sour and sweet in a good way and has sour dried apricot as dominant taste. Some raspberry, fresh sour strawberry, a hint of lemon. Very delicious. It’s a shame that the aroma does not live up to the taste. Still an excellent beer though.

Brancaster Old Les;Kings Lynn, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brancaster;Bottled. Having thought about getting my lips into an Old Les for some time now, I found this disappointing. A little musty but thankfully not fishy. Unstable yeast, perhaps? Still necked it, though, but I may regret that in the morning.

Brancaster Old Les;Kings Lynn, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brancaster;Cask at The Jolly Sailors, Brancaster Staithe, Norfolk, 28-04-07. Tried this next to the IPA and whilst this was the better of the two I found both beers to be slightly underwhelming. Poured amber in colour, lacking a bit in aroma but there was a slight hoppiness. Taste was better and both Bob and myself found the best part of this beer was the lingering bitterness which incidentally the IPA lacked, otherwise it was a bit thin and lacking for it’s strength.

The Brewer was telling me how difficult this beer is to get right. I found it to be full flavoured, with a belt of alcohol on the nose. There is a grassiness in the hop with a pine needle note in the background. I enjoyed it, but I would imagine it to be unstable.

Tazawako Dark Lager;Senboku, Japan;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;From bottle bought at Yamaya near Umeda. 30% off as it must have been near it’s sell by date. Aroma: Light grass, dark cocoa perfume, black licorice, some char. Palate: Medium-bodied but with enough behind it that it never fades. It has a sustained feeling of volume in the mouth. Flavor: Black licorice, unsweetened dark cocoa, light grassy hop that grows into a bigger, bitter charred coffee flavor. Comment: Amazingly long finish and feeling of volume in the mouth that never seems to thin out. I first tried this in a narrow tall glass and the sharper burnt character was emphasised, but then poured it into a tulip glass that brought out the aroma and toned down the bitter burned character and highlighted a rounder chocolate and licorice flavors. Stunningly good and have to wonder if this was just an unusually good bottle that had a little age on it.

A beautiful dark Amber color with a medium sized foamy tan head. The smell of specialized (Crystal/Munich?) malts with just a slight floral hoppiness. A very nicely balanced brew!

An unusual (but good) scent, somewhat like a herbal cough drop. Similar in flavor to the scent. A snappy hop/herb taste gives way to a sweeter malt.

Munro Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;"Item #4 at June 2006 Toronto cider/mead -fest - bottle from tupalev. Very pale yellow, flat, no head - a mead. Aroma - dry and boozy! Strong tart, almost harsh raw white wine - almost eye-watering. Taste is alcohol, bitter persimmon, again the ""green"" white wine rawness - there’s a lot of sweetness there, I guess that’s the honey. Flat, bitter, alcoholic slick mouthfeel - man this is boozy, and unfortunately harsh - I sniffed the glass after and it had a definite honey smell, moreso than when drinking it."
Munro Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;My bottle, mail order direct from the meadery but stored for 4 months in my cellar. Funky aroma, I wonder if it suffered a bit.

Munro Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;This is a still mead that is a very pale yellow color. The nose is of white wine and honey. It tastes like dry white wine with some honey and oak chip notes. Decent day to day replacement for white wine, but not very interesting.

Pours clear pale amber with a small off white head leaving some lace. Aroma is piny hoppy, malty and sweetish. Crispy mouthfeel.

The Brew Kettle Chiefs Rye Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;The Brew Kettle;On tap at Brew Works. Pours a clear golden color with a light head and a touch of spotty lacing as it makes its way down. The nose is pretty nice with a bit of light citrus. Good hop presence. The flavor is not quite as plentiful, still offering some orange and other citrus, but doesn’t have the bite of the nose. Some spicy rye in there as well, along with a floral character in the midpalate. Light body and a good finishing bitterness. A solid brew. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 04-29-2011
The Brew Kettle Chiefs Rye Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;The Brew Kettle;This poured an amber color with a fluffly white head. Aroma was grainy, sweet malts and not much else. Flavor was sweet, chewy, some rye notes and some grass as well. Not too great.
The Brew Kettle Chiefs Rye Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;The Brew Kettle;Poured a hazed gold color. The aroma had a decent nose citrus hops with some spicy rye. Citrus flavor and bready sweet malt. Spicy finish. Light-medium body.
The Brew Kettle Chiefs Rye Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;The Brew Kettle;"I like rye beers and I like the Brew Kettle both quite a bit, so ordering this beer was an obvious choice for me. And it was not as good as say a Red’s Rye, but it was still pretty tasty. It offered the slightly ""scratchy"" mouthfeel I associate with Rye beers, a rye flavor, and some nice hop notes that I also tend to find in rye beers. Appearance was not so special - a little less color than I might have expected, but a brilliantly clear body with a medium amount of head. Aroma was rye and hops. Flavor as noted above. Mouthfeel a touch thin. Not the best rye-beer I have ever had, but recommendable nonetheless. I had this on tap at the Brew Kettle in Strongsville."
The Brew Kettle Chiefs Rye Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;The Brew Kettle;Draft sample at Brew Kettle.

Moderate bittersweet flavor with a medium bitter finish of moderate duration. My expectations where met.
The Brew Kettle Chiefs Rye Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;The Brew Kettle;Bottle shared by goldtwins. Pours a clear golden orange with a thin linen white head. Pleasant aroma of rye, caramel, citrus, and a bit of brown sugar. The flavor is lightly sweet with rye and caramel up front followed by some strong hops bitterness. The bitterness very much overshadows the malt, and lingers briefly after the swallow.
The Brew Kettle Chiefs Rye Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;The Brew Kettle;Thanks to goldtwins for sharing - hazy copper beer, with the faint wisp of a head - the rye is a lot more apparent in the aroma than I expected, but a strong hop presence keeps it from being overpowering - a little bit of buttery, bready character in the aroma as well - some floral notes up front, but mostly strong bitter hops throughout, with rye poking through at the start and finish - malt sweetness doesn’t quite balance it out, as it stays strongly bitter, but it’s a mighty tasty bitterness - one-dimensional, but good.
The Brew Kettle Chiefs Rye Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;The Brew Kettle;Bottle. Aroma of rye bread, light citrus, rye seed, light cracker, more and more citrus as warms. Flavor somewhat dominated by the citrus hops with the rye becoming more generalized malt backbone, but still tasty. Sharp carbonation and a nice bitter finish. Good stuff.

Aromas of wheat malt, yeasty clove, mostly clove, light banana ester. Typical, but nothing other special. flavor is conversely banana ester, light spicy clove and wheat malt, well balanced with a bit too much hop finish & aftertast IMHO for a Hefe, but I’ll live with it. M/f is medium to full with higher carbonation, lightly dry. A very solid HW but not outstanding. I’d take this over many American versions.

Audomaroise Blonde;Saint-Omer, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Audomaroise;"750ml bottle from the in laws-to-be. Filmy orange with the bits in and a good, subsiding billow of head. Aroma of lime, lilies, slight farmyard. Grassy hop speckled with sherbet; candy cigarette and oaked hints. Straight down the middle, tasty, no frills stuff. The condition dies over a bottle, but this is good enough to make me wonder what other minor treasures are lurking over the border in that obstacle between England and Belgium...Frenchland, I think they call it."

Audomaroise Blonde;Saint-Omer, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Audomaroise;Bottle at Chris_o pre GBBF Shindig 08. Cloudy gold, thin lasting beige head. It’s a sourish biere de garde, bit musty, pourly made. Very uncultured aroma. Pretty poor by most BDG standards.
Uncle Stuarts Blowfield Heath;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Porter;Uncle Stuarts;Gravity Dispense - White Horse Hedgerley BF. I have stylized this as a porter, but there is a chance it could be a strong(ish) mild. it is sometimes hard to tell. Anyway this is a very tasty black beer which has good chocolate notes in both the smell and the palate. It is very pleasant and drinkable.
Audomaroise Ambrée;Saint-Omer, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Audomaroise;750ml bottle out of my Xmas lucky dip from the in-laws-to-be. Amber?? More like ruby with a loose beige collar clumping with yeast. Medicinal, lightly oaked aroma with hints of banana, marzipan and cherry sourness. Flemish-hinting brew with flecks of acidity, marzipan, iron, a distinctly herbal green leaf finish (rocket!) and some splashes of drying, tannic, red wine character. A bit messy and homemade in feel, becoming too metallic for its own good but carries the alcohol deceptively well. Unusual brew with an unexpected complexity- accidental or otherwise.

Nevskoe Kronverk;St. Petersburg, Russia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);(Canned, BBE 03/03/2005?) Paleish golden color with a small, slightly lacy head. A cardboardy, toned-down aroma of a cellulose plant. All flavors that may have been included, seem to have faded away. There are no offensive sidetastes, however - only a distant hint of corny malt. Very carbonated, light-bodied and quite thin palate. This is the most tasteless brew I’ve had for a long time, but I believe it can do better. Should re-rate with a fresher sample.

Iron Hill Dunkelweizen;Newark, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Iron Hill Newark;I really like the banana aroma. It draws u in but the taste is just a touch thin.

Iron Hill Dunkelweizen;Newark, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Iron Hill Newark;Dark brown roasted and sweet aroma. Enjoyed with schnitzel and buttered noodles. First try at this style. Very good. Enjoyed the muted sharpness of the hefewiezen spiciness by the malts. Wish this style was more accessible. Banana and cloves are still easily recognized but the caramel sweetness balances it out. Became more sweet as i drank it, sometimes too sweet,

Iron Hill Dunkelweizen;Newark, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Iron Hill Newark;Hazy muddy brown with a minimal head and modest lace.

Aroma of bananas and clove with some bittersweet chocolate and toffee with a slight bit of roast and bready yeast. The flavor is roasted malt with bitter chocolate and a spicy cloves that come through strong, along with some toffee and bready yeast to round out the flavors on the back end. Medium light body and moderate carbonation.
Iron Hill Dunkelweizen;Newark, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Iron Hill Newark;Tap at Iron Hill Maple Shade. By far the worst of the beers I tried.

Munro Cranberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Yellow pink body that is still after the pour. The aroma is fruity, of cranberry and red apple, with a touch of raspberry. The taste is semi-sweet honey mixed with fruit (cranberry, raspberry) and a tart and bitter appleskin. Sweet, and has the same sugar content as some of their other meads, but the cranberry seems to create an acidity or dryness that is welcome. This is a nice replacement for fruit wine or ice-wine where a sweet and luscious beverage is required. I like it.
Munro Cranberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Smells like a rose wine, rose coloured, berry taste, sweet, syrupy, good. Thank You tupalev
Munro Cranberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Bottle shared with a bunch of folks at Doug’s - courtesy of tupalev. Orange-pink colour. Aroma has odd notes of watermelon and cherry with a hint of cranberry. Flavour starts dry and tart, but turns sweeter in the finish. Not bad.
Munro Cranberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Bottle. Pours an orange-pinkish body with no head. The aroma is fruity which includes cherry pits and cranberries. Very sweet though the palate is lightish and fluffy. A certain juiciness with a touch of tartness at times. Not bad.
Munro Cranberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Item #11 at June 2006 Toronto cider/mead -fest - bottle from tupalev. Light peach colour, aroma of cranberry, alcohol and white wine - taste cranberry & alcohol - meh mouthfeel, overall I liked this one a lot, I felt the tart cranberry off-set the honey sweetness and the booze nicely.
Munro Cranberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;"Bottle at our mead/cider tasting at Doug’s. Pinkish copper colour. Really nice tart cranberry aroma. Same nice tart cranberry in taste; problem is I don’t really like cranberry! Sweet syrupy alcohol. Probably the most unbalanced mead so far. Ok."
Munro Cranberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Pale pink/rose colour. No carbonation. Sweet honey, cranberry, & apple aroma w/ light note of cheese & barnyard. Light-medium, somewhat sugary feel. Flavour of honey, sharp cheese, & mildly tart fruit (cranberry, apple, grape).
Munro Cranberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;pink colur. flowery honey aroma with pear, apple and cranberry fruit notes. some slight barnyard. flavour seems kind of between a mead and a cider. not bad.
Munro Cranberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;I liked this cranberry version better than their original mead. It had some character. Poured a pale rose. Stronger honey aroma. Lightly sparkling. Notes of wheat. Modest spicing. Not enough cranberry flavours though. Reasonable honey and apple flavours. Alcohol is more firm. Sweeter finish.
Munro Cranberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Sweet berry aroma, citric dry notes. Sugar sweetness is dominant with noticeable alcohol. Slightly thin in body .Flavour welcomes us with berries followed by honey finish.
Mountain Meadows Sierra Nectar Wildflower Mead;Westwood, California, United States;Mead;Mountain Meadows Mead;Bottle, thanks Alex! Dull straw, doesn’t look great. Aroma has some sticky sugars, light florals, dash of gluey phenols. Dryish character, bit of clean lactic, hint of wildflower honey, but not a lot of complexity in this one. Nothing to really jump out and grab me.
Mountain Meadows Sierra Nectar Wildflower Mead;Westwood, California, United States;Mead;Mountain Meadows Mead;"Bottle, courtesy of fiulijn (thanks Alex), pours a clear yellow with a tiny white head.

Mountain Meadows Sierra Nectar Wildflower Mead;Westwood, California, United States;Mead;Mountain Meadows Mead;Clear light straw, with a delightfully sweet honey aroma with a mild floral tone. Sharp mildly alcoholic start that turns sweet and boozy, mild honey sweetness but with a off flavor of lake water.
Mountain Meadows Sierra Nectar Wildflower Mead;Westwood, California, United States;Mead;Mountain Meadows Mead;A pretty decent mead. Not one for first timers though. As with all meads this one has it’s place. This is great for kicking back in the sun if it’s ice cold. It goes good with European food. Overall a slightly above average mead.
Mountain Meadows Sierra Nectar Wildflower Mead;Westwood, California, United States;Mead;Mountain Meadows Mead;Pale golden color. Aroma is dominated by grape and some earthy undertones. Flavor starts with some grape, light honey sweetness, plus some floral/earthy tastes. Slightly sticky mouthfeel. Not bad, but too dry with a somewhat odd aftertaste. Should not be called semisweet in my opinion.
Mountain Meadows Sierra Nectar Wildflower Mead;Westwood, California, United States;Mead;Mountain Meadows Mead;I agree with some of the other reviews. This had some really bland almost plastic notes. Syrupy and very fragrant, with some salt water taffy, and I definitely get some lighter frtui flavors in here as well. Not my favorite but decent.

Dark Star India Pale Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;IPA;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask at the Cask Pub and Kitchen, 3rd November 2011. Reasonable IPA, I prefer the American Pale Ale, the IPA may be better on Keg a little colder, not impressed either by the Cask Pub and Kitchen, which seamed to be fairly rough in clientele when I visited.
Dark Star India Pale Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;IPA;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask at CP&K. It pours golden yellow, with a thin off-white head. The nose is resin, cheese, fresh hop and pine. The taste is oily green hop, resin, wood, light alcohol warmth, spice, touch of honey, pine, citrus rind and grapefruit, with a decent bitter-dry finish. Medium body and soft carbonation. A solid cask IPA.
Dark Star India Pale Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;IPA;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask in Craft Beer Co. An awesome pint! Pours clear golden amber with light white head. Nose is gorgeous. Orange, lemon, lime and grapefruit citrous, honey. Taste is all those citrous notes again with caramel, honey, touch of pine. Fantastic and best beer of the night.
Dark Star India Pale Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;IPA;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask at CBC, London. Pours clear gold with a foamy, white head.

Dark Star India Pale Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;IPA;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask at the Southampton Arms on 26th September 2011. Gold with thin white head and initial lacing. Rich hoppy aroma then thickly hoppy in-mouth with rich grapefruit and some sweetish tangerine fruitiness. A hoppy, citric aftertaste and a thick mouthfeel.
Dark Star India Pale Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;IPA;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask conditioned at Minehead Beer Fest ’10. Pale gold with white head. A really dry and hoppy monster of a beer, lots of grapefruit skin, bitter, mouth tingling and lip puckering. It doesn’t let up and straight in to being one of my favourites.
Dark Star India Pale Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;IPA;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask at Egham USC, Surrey. Hazy golden coloured pour with a decent fluffy head. Floral, hoppy aroma. Tastes hoppy, a little dry, citrus fruit. Pretty decent effort from Dark Star but they brew better beers.
Dark Star India Pale Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;IPA;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask @ Wenlock Arms, Hoxton, London N1. Pours a golden color with a small white head.

Fenland Is Vic There?;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fenland Brewery;Cask Conditioned, White Horse, Hedgerley, Bucks. Beer Festival Day 4 of 4, beer 19. Rather dark gold. Fruit & tobacco aroma. Flavour is rather sweet, some fruit, a dose of bitterness, very easy drinking, but then a waft of cigarette smoke comes up, and you realise that this is very, very odd. Perhaps someone flicked their ash in my pint glass?
Dark Star Mild;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Gravity cask @ Fratton May Fair Beer Festival. Grainy malts caramelised sugar and a little toast as if the sugar is just about to catch. Not great for dark star with thin graininess the main focus.

Dark Star Mild;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask at Mahars. Nice dark color and sweet taste. Not much bitter to talk of, but it was a good tasting mild, good session beer.
Dark Star Mild;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask@Chelmsford BF. Oddly muted flavour from a Dark Star beer, more traditional than the Over the Moon Mild. Flat, sweetish flavour, not much of a mouthfeel either, feels very empty, touch of grapey fruit, but its very vague. The first time i’ve really been dissapointed by Dark Star.
Dark Star Mild;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Beer #6 at Chelmsford Beer Festival, with Duff. I wasn’t bowled over by this one. Although quite strong for a mild, it is rather short of flavour and a bit thin. Aromas are indistinct. A little malt and a touch of coffee in the flavours, but nothing to write home about. Despite these reservations, it did drink quite nicely which, I guess, is what’s expected of a mild. I prefer the weaker Over The Moon MIld from the same brewery, which has more character in my view. Cask (gravity dispense).
Dark Star Mild;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask conditioned - handpump - Evening Star Brighton. A black beer with little aroma of note. The taste is chocolatey but also quite hoppy for a mild. Very drinkable.
Dark Star Mild;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Cask Conditioned, at the Thurrock Beer Festival, 2004. Dark brown without a head. Static mild which is a little thin (laid back says Silk) but still a solid mild. Dark Star have been on song of late.
Dark Star Mild;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);"Bright bottled @ Thurrock Fest. Fresh notes: ""Very laid back body - almost non-existant, more like inhaling damp air. Restrained woody notes. Not impressed. Score 2.5"" Ah, what a difference a day makes! The body is still light, but now has enough firmness to be noted and acknowledged. And the flavours have settled to come through in a delicate, but very flavoursome manner with soft Belgian chocolate and coffee notes inspiring my mouth. The true joy of this delicate mild was completely missed when just taking a couple of sips while chatting at the Fest. But drinking it now at leisure for breakfast on a sunny morning the full taste comes through. Wonderful!"
Dark Star Mild;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);Draught at the Anchor, Birmingham. Dark Mild. Very rich, smooth, flavoursome beer. One of my favourite Milds, sweet, fresh on the tongue and easy going. Some berry flavour and fudge.
Hanby Mild Mayhem;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Mild Ale;Wem Brewing;Draught at the Anchor, Birmingham. Hmm, a rather strange Mild. Red tinged brown, small beige froth topping (pub net curtains again??). Spicy, especially on the finish with vinegar and concentrated liqueur chocolate flavour. Tastes very strong, but only(?) 5.0%. Sickly alcohol and winey aftertaste.
Nørrebro Montceau Ginger;København, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Nørrebro Bryghus;(On tap) Unusual summer beer from Nørrebro: a pale, top-fermented ginger spiced beer - with lime! Very exotic indeed. Very pronounced flavour from the ginger with acidic, citrusy notes reminding me of a shandy - or Radler. Nice quencher on a hot summers day - if nothing more. 060604
Nørrebro Montceau Ginger;København, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Nørrebro Bryghus;Tap@Nørrebro Bryghus. Sweet ginger softdrink type flavour, soft palate. A lot better than other ginger beers i’ve i had. Its sweet, but not as sickly sweet as others i’ve had, it was a hot day in Copenhagen so it worked nicely anyway, even if i didn’t like it so much.
Nørrebro Montceau Ginger;København, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Nørrebro Bryghus;Golden colour with a fast disappearring head. Smells a bit like yoghourt - sour and sweet. The taste is sour of lime and very sweet with a bit ginger.
Nørrebro Montceau Ginger;København, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Nørrebro Bryghus;It has a pleasant ginger aroma, but the flavour doesn’t have much to do with beer. However I had it on a hot summer day and it works for that.
Nørrebro Montceau Ginger;København, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Nørrebro Bryghus;(on tap)Never where much into good-beer-gone-bad. Tried it several times and the brewers acutally did come out with an OK result, compared to the first tryouts. But in the herb-beer genre it still dosen´t mke it very good. Pale orange with no head and way to weird for me.
Nørrebro Montceau Ginger;København, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Nørrebro Bryghus;Draught: Golden coloured. Filtered. Off white medium lasting head. Medical, herby and spicy aroma. Ginger is very dominating. Almost reminds me of candy (in danish: Bolcher). Flavour is overwhelmingly sweet. Is like some of those gingerblendings I use to make for my indian curries. Quite funny for a beer. Is cloyingly sweet in the aftertaste. Find this beer quite amusing and not unpleasant in small doses.
Nørrebro Montceau Ginger;København, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Nørrebro Bryghus;This is a misunderstanding. Should never have been produced. Sweet, watery body with a weak spicy aroma, almost killed by a syrup sweetness.
Nørrebro Montceau Ginger;København, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Nørrebro Bryghus;On-tap at Nørrebro Bryghus. Served in tall glass with stem. Clear gold color. Obvious ginger presence in the aroma. The taste is dominated by pickled ginger and quickly gets a bit cloying. The finish is slightly dry which helps the drinkability. Ginger can be very refreshing in beer, but in this case isn’t.
Nørrebro Montceau Ginger;København, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Nørrebro Bryghus;[I rate this not bearing in mind how it came to be] An orange beer with a small head. The aroma is dominated by ginger. The flavor is also dominated by ginger on a sweet malty background, which gives way to a dry ending. so for a beer that went wrong, this is quite good.
Nørrebro Montceau Ginger;København, Denmark;Flavored - Other;Nørrebro Bryghus;Light golden color with a white head. The taste is water with ginger and citrusy notes. Tastes artificiak and lemony citrusy. Another one of those... Ups something went wrong, lets add some syrup and see what happens.

Deep amber pint topped with clumpy white suds. Lacy as granny’s dolieys. Slightly soapy citrussy grapefruit hop bitterness. Plenty of body. Oatily biscuity malt after the swallow. A sprinkle of pencil shavings. Possibly not as ’exhilarating’ as claimed in the accompanying prayer-book, but tasty enough to commemorate the half-millenium. Amen.
Church End Sunshine Ale;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Church End Brewery;Cask Conditioned, White Horse, Hedgerley, Bucks. Beer Festival Day 3 of 4, beer 16. This cask was especially dry hopped. This one has lots of biscuit/bready malt, a delicate sweetness, and a fair ammount of hops. I would go so far as to call it the perfect summer beer, but it perhaps has a little too much body to it, to be drunk under the sun.

The appearance of the ale is a nice amber colour with a large and frothy ,slightly off white head. Theres a curious caramel aroma ( very unusual for a Pale Ale here in the NW)..but its underpinned by some slight hop spicyness. This is a very smooth and almost creamy tasting Pale..quite malty..ah I know how this is an English Pale. Very little carbonation..but great taste..if you like your Pale with a more balanced profile. Very nice on the palate , exceptionally smooth. Very drinkable ale..it didnt seem very ""strong"" so this would make a great session drinker."

Oh yea! 10% ! Ya would,nt know it! HEHE.
Manayunk The Three-Eyed Trout Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Manayunk Brewing Company;GABF 2004: Barely transparent with a thin light tan head. Aroma is sweet and roasty with a touch of acidity. Body has a sweet sticky maltiness and decent complexity, but could be a bit thicker. Enjoyable and smooth, this is a decent imperial stout.
Manayunk The Three-Eyed Trout Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Manayunk Brewing Company;Red-black body with tan head. Aroma is sweet, chocolate, roasty, some coffee. Taste is sweet chocolate, roasty, vinous. Full body. Good beer, but the elements didn’t work as well together as I wanted them to.
Manayunk The Three-Eyed Trout Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Manayunk Brewing Company;Poured an opaque black color, crimson edges, a tan head, and nice lacing. Aroma of chocolate, roasted coffee, dark fruits, and a little hop. The taste was full of sweet chocolate. vanilla, coffee and toffee, some fig, lightly peppered, and a slight alcohol finish. Soft and creamy mouthfeel. I’ve never heard of a summer imperial stout, but wouldn’t object if more people made them like this.
Manayunk The Three-Eyed Trout Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Manayunk Brewing Company;Maple-bordered ebony. Thin, dense-bubbled, tan head. Heavy notes of roast, fudge, toasty esters, tangy/earthy hops, and roasted barley in the nose. Whispers of creamed plums, cotton, cocoa, mixed berries, and light airiness. Creamy carbonation. Medium-bodied. Flavorful blend of roasted malts, chocolate fudge, and grapefruity hops. Dried fruit twang offsets some of the malt richness while caramel and chalky black malts caress the hop bitterness. Fairly minerally, as well, which controls the gooey fudge richness. There’s just enough alcohol and seared malts to dry it out as it finishes thickly malted with an assertive backbone of bushy, earthy hops. Hop and fudge notes continue to shine through long after the swallow. This is top-notch stuff.

Kellys Brewpub Weizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Hazed straw gold pour with frothy white head and lace. Aroma is wheat and light fruit. Wheat flavor with a subtle fruitiness on the finish. Nice carbonation on a medium bodied beer.
Kellys Brewpub Weizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Hazy yellow with no head. Faint malty aroma and taste with subtle banana bread on the back end.
Kellys Brewpub Weizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;So good it’s scary. The faintest sugarwater aroma and the full, cloudy yellow body are a great combo. But the velvety texture is alien to me on a beer this light. Thick flavors of lemon, vanilla and cream. Very unusually good white beer.
Kellys Brewpub Weizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;cloudy yellow with a giant frothy resillant head. i had to get through a free pitcher of this with some attractive girls, proof that the sun does shine on a dogs ass occasionally. weak banana nose with some grape. taste is... well, did i mention it was free? and that i was with attractive women? this is a non threatening wheat, light fruit tastes easy bitter. nothing to challenge anyone, but enough slight fruit to still have some taste. lemon notes were buried in there somewhere with the yeasty notes.
Kellys Brewpub Weizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Pours a cloduy bright yellow with a medium white head. Light hop aroma, little fruit (banana). Mostly thin in flavor. There’s a little fruit in there somewhere along with a little spice. Lightly citrusy.
Kellys Brewpub Weizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Wheat Ale;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Cloudy honey color with a soft white head. Aroma is yeasty and worty with a prominent band aid quality. More phenols in the flavor and no discernible esters. Some soapy hop flavor. Missing some qualities of a good wheat beer. Still drinkable though.
Carolina IPA;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Brewing Company;Crystal clear copper pour. Decent head with mild lacing. Hop forward aromas. Grapefruit notes in the hop flavors. Clean finish. ---Rated via iPhone
Carolina IPA;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Brewing Company;Tap @ Hilton RDU at RTP: Clear copper color with small off-white head and sticky lacing. Floral, hop aroma, toast, grass, balanced flavor with a mild hair spray aftertaste. Not bad, easy to drink - exceeded my expectations.
Carolina IPA;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Brewing Company;Mild grapefruit and caramel aroma. Amber with very thin head. Grapefruit, mild caramel, and earthy flavor notes. Medium dryness and bitterness. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Carolina IPA;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Brewing Company;For an IPA, this is awfully meh.. Pours a dark gold with a thick head. Not very hoppy in either taste or smell. Easy on the palate, but not in a particularly appealing way.
Carolina IPA;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Brewing Company;Bottle. The pour was a medium copper amber with an average sized (1-2 finger) white fluffy head that reduced to a medium cap which lead to some really nice streaky lacing. The aroma was of a mild straw malt, floral and citrus hops and an earthy yeast with notes of caramel and citrus (grapefruit and orange peel). The taste was moderately bitter with a mild sweet maltiness and a touch of caramel early on, and then progressed into this hoppy bitter taste that had a good note of citrus towards the end. The flavor lasted for quite a long while with the hoppy citrus flavor fading nice and slow. Mouthfeel was just above light in body with a decently dry texture and a moderate carbonation. Overall an IPA that gets back to the basics: hops, citrus and a mild caramel malty taste. You really don’t need much else...
Carolina IPA;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Brewing Company;Pours a dark, coppery amber, almost mahogany, that is crystal clear and has a fairly thick, fluffy and somewhat persistent off-white head. Aroma is hoppy and fruity, not strong but still appetizing. Hoppy flavor has subtle woody and fruity notes and minimal bitterness. Texture is smooth, firm-bodied and fairly fizzy. Not spectacular, but still enjoyable.
Carolina IPA;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Brewing Company;Pours a clear hazelnut with a nice off white head. Huge grapefruit aroma o’ hops. This is one of the better IPA’s I’ve had because it is perfectly balanced and not overly bitter. A creamy mouthfeel of roasty malt and a bit of hoppy pine. Finish is smooth with the slightest lingering of citric bitterness.
Carolina IPA;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Brewing Company;Blurred, reddish amber appearance with a small, fast fading, off white head and moderate lacing. Spicy hop aroma with a hint of caramel malts. Subtle citrus hop taste with toffeeish malts in the background. Medium-to-light bodied, decently carbonated mouthfeel with a short lived finish, Not exciting but not a drain pour either.
Carolina IPA;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Brewing Company;Copper colored with a white head. Medium citrus and pine hops with light caramel malts, too. Light hop bite and a bit of sweet malts, too. Refreshing on the beach. Nice but nothing special.
Carolina IPA;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Carolina Brewing Company;Nice white head and cloudy orange color. Aromas and flavors of grapefruit citrus hops. Some green apple fruit flavor as well. Finish is a nice citrus bitterness. A bit of a cream, buttery texture. Is that an infection?

Tazawako Alt;Senboku, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;Happy to find an E6 Series Shinkansen Komachi Service-themed beer, as it happens to be my favourite train. Unusual presentation, although I still love the basketball shoe-looking locomotive. This is a nice alt, easy to drink, malty, biscuit aroma, sweet flavour of caramel, biscuits, with a lingering bitterness that actually gets quite strong in the end. Medium bodied, I could actually drink a lot more of it.
Tazawako Alt;Senboku, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;Una cerveza bonita a los ojos y muy agradable en boca (aunque escasa en nariz). Amargor bien equilibrado con notas de caramelo. Textura efervescente y muy refrescante.

Tazawako Alt;Senboku, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;Keyaki fall 2016. Nice light raisin aromas with bready notes. Easy drinking, but a nice play of bready malts and fruit-like notes. Easy drinking and well-done for a Japanese alt.
Tazawako Alt;Senboku, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;Great colour. Somewhat harsh and carbonic mouthfeel. Missing typical Duesseldorf style Alt funkiness. That being said, clean and drinkable.
Tazawako Alt;Senboku, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Tazawako Beer Brewery Pub;Bottle from local Yamaya. Light raost malt nose, caramel, fruity. Deep dark reddish-copper color.

Central City Red Racer Raspberry Wheat Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Central City Brewers + Distillers;Aroma is soft raspberry blended into bready malt. Has a soft semi-clear brown body with no head. Flavour is a nice mix of raspberry and malt, though they seem like they are crushed together. Mouthfeel is medium with a kind of watery finish. This has okay flavour but the build is missing structure. If that makes sense.
Central City Red Racer Raspberry Wheat Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Central City Brewers + Distillers;Rating #2442 - 2016.04.12 - Taproom at Central City mall. Pours a deep pinkish with a bubbly white head. Aroma is strong raspberry jam. Taste is significant raspberry jam. Almost bordering on a beer cooler. Finish is tart, but not unpleasant. Fruit dominates the palate a touch too much for my taste.
Central City Red Racer Raspberry Wheat Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Central City Brewers + Distillers;Sweet and jammy like a raspberry tart but without the sour edge to take it it’s a bit too much. Still better than a lot of the weak ass American wheats that just hint at raspberry. At least they try.
Central City Red Racer Raspberry Wheat Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Central City Brewers + Distillers;Draft - Sweet raspberry jam. Clear coppery jam with a decent white head. Sweet and jammy, too sweet.
Central City Red Racer Raspberry Wheat Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Central City Brewers + Distillers;If you like raspberry beer, with a stress on the raspberry perhaps, you can’t get back than this. It’s by far the best Red Racer has to offer, and you can only get it in house. If you’re ambivalent about fruity beer, avoid this one.
Central City Red Racer Raspberry Wheat Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Central City Brewers + Distillers;Poured from the tap at the breweries main center in Surrey. Very good aroma of crushed raspberries. Kind of reminds me of the Mc Donalds raspberry smoothie smell. Nice refreshing taste. The carbonation keeps the taste alive and keeps the pallet tingling. I love this delivery mechanism. The beer turns into a foam that slowly released flavor without overwhelming the taste buds. I could easily have a pitcher of this on a patio with some friends.
Central City Red Racer Raspberry Wheat Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Central City Brewers + Distillers;Poured from the tap. Murky medium brown with white head. Aroma of raspberry purée. Taste has mild raspberry with a very light wheat flavour (think white bread).
Central City Red Racer Raspberry Wheat Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Central City Brewers + Distillers;A very mild and fruity brew. Pours a pink tinged gold with a foamy white head. The nose is sweet, tart and definately fruity with a minor hop and citrus quality. The flavor of raspberries is not huge in the flavor, but its there with a light tartness. A mild hop on the finish with a few lemon notes. Overall, nice fruity brew.
Central City Red Racer Raspberry Wheat Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Central City Brewers + Distillers;On tap. Pours an orange brown with light head. Light strawberry and malt aromas. Clean flavors of raspberry and strawberries. Not overly sweet or syrupy. Nice summer beer.

Aroma is mild raspberries and mild hops. Taste is tart raspberry with some malty sweetness and mild hop presence. Light bodied with decent carbonation. Slightly below average fruit beer, but still refreshing.
Trinidad Ghost Town Brown;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Trinidad Brewing Company;Tried this at the brewery and picked up a bottle years ago in Trinidad and am only now adding my rating. Light brown appearance. White head with a light toast and chocolate aroma. Some decent balance, but a bit on the sweet side.
Trinidad Ghost Town Brown;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Trinidad Brewing Company;05-Aug-08 (22-oz bottle: Free sample bottle for stewarding the 2008 World Beer Cup in San Diego, CA) This beer pours clear and deep red in color with a brownish tint and an inch of light-tan head. The nose is roasty, but also sour, stinky a funky, so contamination appears to be an issue. The sourness is fairly pervasive in the flavor, but doesn’t quite mask the dry, roasty malts and dusty hops. Still, this beer isn’t what I suspect it should be, namely, a roasty, malty beer. Apple skins, tart fruits, but not in a good way. Dry and acidic mouthfeel, medium in body, moderately carbonated. Not enjoyable and the rest of this beer is hitting the kitchen sink very soon. Hopefully the other three bottles sent to the WBC weren’t infected as well, but it could explain why the beer didn’t make it out of the first round. Will look for a new bottle if I get to GABF this fall.
Trinidad Ghost Town Brown;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Trinidad Brewing Company;Deep mahogany hue with a decent tan head. Nutty-sweet nose. Nice body yet fairly easy to drink. Surprisingly nice malt flavors/aromas, such as dark chocolate, tobacco, toffee and wood. Hops were earthy and grassy, with a healthy amount of bitterness to balance things out. This is definitely one of the finer TBC beers I’ve had. Quite a bit of personality for a a typically boring style.
Trinidad Ghost Town Brown;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Trinidad Brewing Company;Bomber poured a clear dark brown with ruby highlights and a small lingering tan head. Aromas of milk chocolate, carmel, toasted malt and a hint of nuts. Palate was medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of cocoa,. coffee, and toasted malt with a smooth moderatly bitter finish.
Trinidad Ghost Town Brown;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Trinidad Brewing Company;Aroma is not good, there is a hint of roasted malt but this is overshadowed by an odd molding grass thing. Color is a deep, dark amber with low carbonation and a tight off white head. Taste is like roasted pine needles. Starting with a medium body it goes down smooth with a slightly flat feel. Finish comes in with a roasted flavor that has a pine like taste that stays all the way though with a sour twang biting at the sides of your tong. I did not like this beer, I don’t like pine flavors and its just odd and a bit flat.
Trinidad Ghost Town Brown;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Trinidad Brewing Company;Delicious brown, full but not heavy - well done. One of the better Brown Ales I have enjoyed.
Trinidad Ghost Town Brown;Trinidad, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Trinidad Brewing Company;Pours brownish orange with a thick dissipating off white head. Malty aroma followed by a nice malty flavor with a hint of chocolate. Low carbonation. A nice beer.

Grand Union Mild;Hayes, Greater London, England;Mild Ale;Grand Union;Cask@The Magpie and Crown, Brentford, London. Fairly smooth and sweetish mild. Some caramel/toffee and roasted malt. Very soft mouthfeel. I know its a mild, but i still think it needs a bit more guts.
Grand Union Mild;Hayes, Greater London, England;Mild Ale;Grand Union;Pretty much what kook said. OK as a lightweight quaffing beer but a bit thin and unremarkable. The mouthfeel is a touch ashy. Cask (gravity dispense), Ealing Beer Festival.

Grand Union Mild;Hayes, Greater London, England;Mild Ale;Grand Union;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Clear brown body with little or no head. Thin and washed out looking for mild.

Arundel Chilly Willie;Arundel, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arundel Brewery;Cask conditioned at the Lambton Worm (JDW), Sunderland. Copper coloured, moderate head. Fruity sweet aroma with malts and hints of barnyard. Flavour is instantly very sweet, but there’s also an instant breakthrough of zesty hops that are not very bitter but still add nicely to the flavour. Slightly warming mouthfeel, you might think it’s stronger than it actually is. (No particular effect on my willie, though.) An interesting beer!
Arundel Chilly Willie;Arundel, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arundel Brewery;The aroma is too strong and too much of everything, earth, dirt, herbs. Brown color, small beige head, good lace. Very herbal flavor, grass, nice bitterness, medium body. Like the aroma strong flavors but in a positive way.

Finishes musky with citrus and bittering hops."
Sockeye Fish Hugger Organic;Boise, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Sockeye Brewing;Moderately hazy amber color with plenty of sticky thin head & lacing. Typical citrus & floral character with lightly toasted malt nose. The flavor has some light sweet malts and strong bitterness that pokes around your mouth like an unwanted guest. Finishes slightly sweet with a balanced tail. As the glass appears more half-full the mouthfeel turns a bit stale & medicinal from the hops.
Warcop Rockers;Newport, Gwent, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Warcop;Cask Stillage at the Paradise Brewery Bar, Wrenbury 02/07/2004 Clear golden coloured with some fruit and hop aroma. Slightly dry finish.
Warcop Rockers;Newport, Gwent, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Warcop;This has a hazy appearance and very low carbonisation.A bitter edge makes for quite a pleasant beer but like a lot of bottle conditioned ales it is nothing like as good as the cask version pulled on hand pump.

Clear deep amber - brown beer, no head. Palate is light and semi dry, modest carbonation. Very mellow dark malts, lightly tangy and very mildly sweet. Light tangy fruits. Light spice.

Mountain Meadows Cherry Mead;Westwood, California, United States;Mead;Mountain Meadows Mead;Clear dark rosy red in appearance, with a big nose of boozy sweet cherries. Flavor is pretty bone dry, but the notes of tart cherries and alcohol spice is pleasant, albeit simple.
Mountain Meadows Cherry Mead;Westwood, California, United States;Mead;Mountain Meadows Mead;Still mead. Aroma is cross between dark cherries and honey. Dry, with a little residual sugar in the aftertaste. Warming alcohol on the tongue. Perhaps a little oxidation? Palate is not soft.

Mountain Meadows Apricot Mead;Westwood, California, United States;Mead;Mountain Meadows Mead;This mead introduces itself with a healthy aroma consisting of honey and apricots. It is a reddish golden color with no head and decent lacing. This smooth solution has a tart intro that then turns sour-sweet as it flows through the mouth. The taste of honey is first detected then apricot appears then back to a honey taste as it leaves the mouth. A hint of cinnamon can also be detected as this mead leaves the mouth.
Mountain Meadows Apricot Mead;Westwood, California, United States;Mead;Mountain Meadows Mead;Rather sour and unpleasant. I wonder if something’s gone wrong b/c I’ve never tasted honey that’s sour before. An extremely thin, watery mead that’s essentially a wine cooler with loads of sour apricots in it. It is in no way reminiscent of what I think of when I think mead. It is like sourish sangria with a honey aroma. A staggering disappointment, given the money paid for this bottle to be shipped to NYC. Perhaps use more sulfites as preservates in future batches.
Mountain Meadows Apricot Mead;Westwood, California, United States;Mead;Mountain Meadows Mead;Portland Holiday Ale Festival 2004. Peach and wildflower aroma, prominent aroma of honey is this one. Flavour is very sweet but the mead is surprisingly thin-bodied. A bit of tannins. Slight ruddy colour.

Ramsgate Gadds Dark Mild Ale;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Mild Ale;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);Excellent Dark Mild. Very true to type, although I would think that Eddie would disagree. Typically Gadds, light on a aroma, full on bitterness, derived from the malt and early hops. Can on occasion be a bit light on body, but hey ho, it’s good chugging beer.
Ramsgate Gadds Dark Mild Ale;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Mild Ale;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);Hand pulled at the Wellingotn, Birmingham. Good appearance: a dark, covonian brown, with hints of maroon, and a short creamy scum top. Aroma - fairly indistinguishable. Taste is a little Germanic, most reminsicent of a light Dunkel or suchlike, but pretty easy going. Some smidges of coco, but little roast or bitterness. Milky mouthfeel, which lifts the experience, making this a quaffable, refreshing experience. Archetypal Mild, which makes it good in my book.

Bent River Dortmunder Export;Moline, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Bent River Brewing Company;Darft, at Bent River. Pours a nice golden pils color with a good lacy head. A very well turned pilsener malt character, slightly chewy, maybe even a touch of Vienna malt. Taste is very much like a fresh DAB, well-replicated Dortmund hard water component. Absolutely right on style with no distractions.
Bent River Dortmunder Export;Moline, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Bent River Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Too light in color, although it is a deep golden color. Odd head with speckled bubbles. The lager yeast they use frames the malt taste of this well. In the middle of the palate is a metal and almost salami-like (?) flavor. Real good finishing hops.

Ruby River Hefeweizen;Ogden, Utah, United States;Wheat Ale;Ruby River Steakhouse and Brewery;on tap-pours a thin creamy white head and cloudy yellow color. Aroma is mild wheat, spice. Taste is mild wheat, spice, some citrus-lemon. An American wheat. Mild effervescence.
Ruby River Hefeweizen;Ogden, Utah, United States;Wheat Ale;Ruby River Steakhouse and Brewery;light and creamy, with a bit of a chilled malt of meal kind of flavoring, would go nicely with breakfast. Not alot of complexity going on here, slight banana notes in the finish.
Ruby River Pale Ale;Ogden, Utah, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ruby River Steakhouse and Brewery;"On tap at that cavernous restaurant in Ogden; man, I like this place more everytime I go. Pours a deep amber color with a large white head. The aroma is dominated by rich citrus hops and some caramel. The flavor is very nice; lots of hops, slightly bitter and leaning towards the citrus side of things. Quaffable and nice."
Library ODB;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Wheat Ale;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;"Draft at the brewpub, 9/29/07; Nose of banana esters and grain; cloudy yellow-orange with a small offwhite head; flavor is hoppy bitterness and fruity esters. OK brew!"
Library ODB;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Wheat Ale;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;on tap-pours a white head and slightly hazy yellow color. Aroma is candy, faint wheat. Taste is musty. OK effervescence.
Library ODB;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Wheat Ale;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;The brewer suggests serving lemon with this beer . . . . That would be wrong as it has a lemony, grassy character of its own. A wimpy wheat beer. Not much of anything desireable here.
Library ODB;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Wheat Ale;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;Hazy golden color, with a sour funky nose. Flavor is big cereal malt toastiness, with some inherent yeastiness, light banana and clove, with some bubblegum and wheatgrass sourness. Overall, there is just not enough oopmh there, not overly watery as in previous ratings but just too light I guess. All the flavor components are there, just need to tweak the recipes a bit.
Library ODB;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Wheat Ale;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;Draught. Pours gold with a rocky white film and spotty lacing. Wheat, overwhelming amount, with bananas and clove with a yeast (dough) nose. Sour wheat malt (straw) and sweaty yeast flavor. Light bodied and refreshing.
Library ODB;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Wheat Ale;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;"Golden-orange with a slight haze and some floaties; thinnish head. Light and refreshing mouthfeel with a lively carbonation, but it seemed watery at times. Very light malts with just a mild, honey-like sweetness. Flowery hops. Mild bitterness. Dryish finish. Pretty much what I expected -- and usually find -- with an ""American Wheat."""
Library Thomas Stevens Extra Pale Ale;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;This is just a typical APA, average all the way around. A textbook example of how to make a boring beer. Floral citrus hop nose, with a balancing sweet pale malt backbone. Very light and subdued.
Library Thomas Stevens Extra Pale Ale;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;Draught. Pours pale gold with a foamy white head and lined lacing. Fruit citrus hop and sour malt (straw) aromas. Bitter acidic citrus rind hop sour malt flavor. Light bodied and spicy palate.
Library Thomas Stevens Extra Pale Ale;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;Clear and golden in color. Light and somewhat watery body. Light malts (grains, sweet cereal). Nice aromas of flowers, but much too subdued. Balancing bitterness, relatively speaking, of course. No offensive flavors or aromas, but no excitement either. Being too easy to drink would be it’s biggest positive, I suppose.

Library Red Eye Ale;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;A very drinkable session-type beer. Obviously designed to please the nearby university crowd. This beer would be equally good on a hot summer’s day or a cold winter’s night.
Library Red Eye Ale;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;A full on amber, that could quite possibly called a nut amber. This has alot of caramel and toasted toffee maltiness, along with all kind of honey sweet nuttiness. I liked it, I would drink this again, and I really tend to look down on session beers.
Library Red Eye Ale;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;Draught. Pours amber with a tan rocky film and spotty cream lacing. Fruit and sweet caramel malt aroma. Bitter rind acidic start with a caramel malt body. Medium bodied and spicy palate.
Library Red Eye Ale;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;"Clear and amber-red. Creamy head with nice, lingering lace patterns. Moderate carbonation; crisp and clean mouthfeel. Sweet and very tasty malts, but they weren't pronounced enough. Notes of fruity caramel, cooked nuts and a little toast. Not overly exciting, but easy to drink and nicely balanced."
Library Sigmunds Nut Brown;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Brown Ale;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;August of 07 at the Library. A cloudy red with a slight off white head.

Library Sigmunds Nut Brown;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Brown Ale;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;A very nice drinkable brown ale. Not quite a session ale but definately an ale that I would drink more than one of.
Library Sigmunds Nut Brown;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Brown Ale;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;This is a really tame porter, that has cleverly disguised itself as a bigger brown ale. Lots of roasted maltiness, creamy mouthfeel, malt balls, and toffee, with some really likeable milk chocolate in the afterpalate. As it warms, hazelnut flavor join in the boquet. Alright, but needs some work.
Library Sigmunds Nut Brown;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Brown Ale;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;Draught. Pours nut brown with a fizzy small tan head and creamy spotty lacing. Medium coffee chocolate aromas, nutty. Bitter and thin caramel malt milk chocolate flavor with coffee notes. Medium bodied and thin palate.
Library Sigmunds Nut Brown;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Brown Ale;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;Clear and dark brown with burgundy highlights. Creamy and thickish on the tongue with a lively carbonation. Notes of sweet toffee, toasted bread and caramelized nuts. A thick and sweet brown ale that yearns to be a porter. Too sweet -- and not bitter enough -- for me, though.
Sierra Madre Brewing Pilsner;Monterrey, Mexico;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sierra Madre Brewing Co. (Mexico);Can 4.6% a nice clear gold with a full mouthfeel & a hay or light grassy body. A clean bitter hop flavor & a dry finish makes for a nice pilsner.
Sierra Madre Brewing Pilsner;Monterrey, Mexico;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sierra Madre Brewing Co. (Mexico);Can thanks to swalden28. The look is yellow in color, clear, and has a white head. The smell is corn, malt, wheat chex, and slight fruit. The taste is malts, corn, chex, and floral.
Sierra Madre Brewing Pilsner;Monterrey, Mexico;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sierra Madre Brewing Co. (Mexico);For a north american produced pilsener this is a really good one. Beats out a ton of American craft breweries.
Sierra Madre Brewing Pilsner;Monterrey, Mexico;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sierra Madre Brewing Co. (Mexico);A decent lager beer from Mexico. The nose is a bit fruity for a lager but pleasant. It is a light and balanced brew with a touch of bitterness to the finish and a subtle mineral-ish quality.
Sierra Madre Brewing Pilsner;Monterrey, Mexico;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sierra Madre Brewing Co. (Mexico);OK, I don’t even know what just went on. I’m quite baffled by this beer. My first impression is that for a Mexican lager it smelled great. I got some peach, citrus, and even a tropical, coconut-esque feel to it. Quite unique, but pleasant, I’ll admit. I wasn’t exactly sober when I had this, so my overall impression of how good the aroma was might have been greatly magnified by my BAC. It does look like a typical pale lager, though, unappetizing and boring, and unfortunately those two adjectives also befit the taste, which, truth be told, is less metallic/industrial than your typical Budweiser. The palate is also quite weak. I don’t know if they sprayed my can with something to make it smell good or if I was just hallucinating, but my nose led me to expect great things that weren’t delivered.
Sierra Madre Brewing Pilsner;Monterrey, Mexico;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sierra Madre Brewing Co. (Mexico);12 oz can. Pours a pale yellow gold with a small white head. Aroma is ok, some corny cereal grain notes, a bit of the hoppiness coming through, a bit musty. Flavor is bland, lots of the corny offputting grain, a bit stale tasting, bland and
Sierra Madre Brewing Pilsner;Monterrey, Mexico;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sierra Madre Brewing Co. (Mexico);Pours a cloudy lemon yellow in color. Hoppy malty aroma. I can almost detect the wort notes. Some nuttyness as well mixed in like pine wood. Fairly clean tasting nutty malt flavor. Overall, it’s very surprising... I expected less.

Sierra Madre Brewing Pilsner;Monterrey, Mexico;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sierra Madre Brewing Co. (Mexico);Cold can courtesy Fratto. Pours a fairly clear golden yellow color. Little head. Aroma is musty and metallic. Sour malts and grains. The smell kind of takes me back. Flavor is sharp notes of bitter malts and soured grains. Metallic flavors with grossness. Ugh this is not good. Here comes the obligatory CHEERS!
Sierra Madre Brewing Pilsner;Monterrey, Mexico;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sierra Madre Brewing Co. (Mexico);Light, cloudy yellow, absent white head. Pure corn smell. How is it possible that a beer brewed in mexico with strict adherance to the German purity law of sixteenhundred and some ought bullshit taste so much like corn. I wonder? Barley doesn’t grow in Mehico maybe? Sweet corn aftertaste.

Wind River Korruption Kolsch Ale;Pinedale, Wyoming, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Wind River Brewing;I had a pint of this at my local Old Chicago: It poured a nice clear straw gold with a small head of foam that stayed for the entire session. The smell is very delicate. I note some malt sweetness and that’s about it. The taste is very delicate but there’s some malt sweetness with a touch of hop bitterness midway through that lasts through the finish. This is a really smooth beer that has just enough flavour to keep you interested and it’s quite a drinkable beer. I had it with a grilled sirloin steak.. Bottom line: I don’t have much experience with the style but this one certainly is a nice sample that is tasty and very drinkable. I think I found a new session beer! I can recommend it. 02-11-2007

Wind River Korruption Kolsch Ale;Pinedale, Wyoming, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Wind River Brewing;Sampled at the NABA 06 Fest: Yellow color, light head and lacing. Some husky pale malts show in the nose with some light banana and clove notes. A bit better than the Sheppards Weiss in regards to the overall goodness, but it’s still missing that rich tastiness I crave in these German style beers. Thin finish, brief tail. Forgettable.

Light and kind of watery body with a mild carbonation. Sweet malts (cereal, sugary grains, honey). Very light esters begged for more of a spotlight. Bitterness also wanted more attention, with sweetness hogging the ball. Sticky, somewhat cloying finish. No major off-flavors, but this one left me thoroughly unexcited.

Wind River Wyoming Pale Ale (WPA);Pinedale, Wyoming, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Wind River Brewing;"Citrusy American hop aroma - grapefruit and tangerine. Color is pale yellow, with a slight chill haze. Head is strangely short lived for such a hoppy beer. Medium low hop flavor leads quickly to a malty sweetness that is complimentary to fruity citrus notes. Finishes malty, with a lingering bitterness.

Wind River Buckin Bitter;Pinedale, Wyoming, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wind River Brewing;Growler filled at The Liquor Store in Jackson, WY located next to Albertson’s and consumed the same day. Pours a clear amber with a thin-moderate linen white head that lasted through the first two sips and leaves no lace. Pleasant aroma of malt with a hint of caramel. The flavor is malt and again just a hint of caramel. Excellent mouthfeel to this beer. Very smooth with no bite at all, which is not what I think of in a bitter, but I like very much nonetheless. Medium bodied.

Plank Road Original Draught;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Draft in Myrtle Beach after golf. Pours a decent golden with a white head. Not much in the aroma department but a crisp refreshing beer after a hot round of golf. Not all that bad.
Plank Road Original Draught;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle, from the excellent vintage bottled beer stall at GBBF, consumed at Kookfest, September 2006. Indeterminate age. Nice to get a historical curiosity but the beer wasn’t up to much, not surprisingly. Golden colour & not too flat. Barley any aroma. Sweet taste with a sort of cosmetic edge and virtually no body. Not much merit now, if it had any in the first place. But not really that much worse than many fresh pale lagers, especially those from the tropics.

Slightly bitter taste to start, but clean after-taste. Head held up well all the way down the glass.

Misted copper with a beige halo. Sticky, yeasty red fruit skin and sesame aroma- as usual. Muddy jam, indistinct red fruit, cranberry, yeast, top of a berry cheesecake. Just another average Cottage beer scoring the generic 636312.

Spicy aroma with honey and leather scent. Fruity in-mouth; raspberries, herby hops. Finish was quite sharp, bitter and with continuing fruitiness; grassy notes on roof of mouth that enrich and intensify late-on. Quite a complex ale and the flavour notes sit well together."

Cottage Atlantic;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;"Cask (handpump), at the Edgar Wallace, Strand. Bright, deep copper colour. Scant white head. Mainly malty aroma. Sort of damp, clammy character with a smoky edge. The palate is all soft malt and berry fruit. Soft and smooth mouthfeel. Notice how often the word ""smooth"" is coming up? Perhaps a bit too often. A pleasant enough mellow and malty bitter but rather lacking in bite and, er, bitterness."

Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Raspberry Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at RB - Chicago. Poured a hazy, ruby-tinted amber with a short cap of white head. Aroma was of artificially-sweetened raspberries with an underlying tangy wheat presence.. bit of soap and some odd sugars in there as well. Raspberry and wheat tanginess throughout the flavor with some tingly sweet grains.. semi-sweet raspberries on the finish. Lighter-bodied and very grainy on the palate.. tartness was overwhelming at times.. long-ish finish.
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Raspberry Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;This is a striking looking drink, a slightly hazed, glowing pinkish-orange or orange-ish pink with a tall, creamy light pink head. The aroma is that of freshly picked raspberries, clean and fresh, with a touch of honey sweetness. Soft in the mouth, it has a gentle, not overly sweet fruit flavor. Light sweet malts, honey, a dash of herbal hops, and some wheat acidity are also on hand. The finish is clean and fresh. Very nice. Rock Bottom Chicago, Chicago, IL
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Raspberry Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Draft. A note on the blackboard behind the bar says this is ""Made with 160 pounds of real raspberries"" in a 30 bbl brew system. The bartender told me it also uses 120 lb. of honey. Hazy American wheat color with a tinge of rosiness. Pleasant raspberry smell under a low-lying, milk-foam head. The taste is actually understated for the usual fruit beer; raspberries stay in the background, except for their tartness, which seems complemented by citrusy American hops. I also get nice notes of wine and oak. Pretty darn good!"
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Raspberry Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Draught 2004: hazed rosy-peach; thick, white-pink froth, that remains throughout the glass. Fleshy raspberry-hay aroma with a pinch of citrus (lemons). Crisp flavour with a light raspberry tartness that is surprisingly not bad – not sweet as I was expecting. The palate is very thin and the aftertaste is just a quick citrus spurt, but I enjoyed this quite a bit more than I thought I would."
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Raspberry Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;Hazy golden body with pink streaks and a nice fluffy, white, persistent head. The aroma has a nice citrus element as well as showing the sweet, fresh berries, a little banana and a hint of clove. The body is fairly light, which makes for easy drinking on a warm day. The flavor is surprisingly non-sweet considering the nose. The tart citrus fruit and more common wheat elements (banana, clove, etc.) are the prominent players. Not my favorite style, but not a bad offering for the summer ahead.
Goose Island Peligrosa Red;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"Draught; Clybourn Brew Pub: Dark maroon and slightly opaque, minimal white ring of bubbles. Wonderful piney-hop aroma with a fresh lemon bitterness. Dark caramelized bitter goo on the tongue – seems a bit too dark colored for such wonderful Cascade hop bitterness. There is a good cherry fruitiness that adds another dimension to this bitter, malty treat. An ale I wouldn’t mind having for my wedding. . ."
Goose Island Peligrosa Red;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);As expected from an all Cascade hop ale, the aroma is quite citrusy. The taste is dripping with fresh hop nectar. There are notes of citrus and grapefruit, along with a dominant general fruitiness. There is a subtle sweetness from the malt which helps to balance and pick up the hops a bit. This beer is definitely a hop celebration/ oriented beer, the malt component only serves to highlight the hops. This is a pretty good example of an all Cascade hop beer.
Goose Island Peligrosa Red;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Clear ruby body with a nice, white head. Nice balanced aroma of sweet malt and piney hops. Caramel, subtle fruity esters, pine resin, grapefruit and whole grains. Creamy, smooth palate that is very easy drinking. The flavors are great and further show the balance between the strong malt backbone, the bitter but fruity hops and the doughy, fruity yeast. Finishes with a sharp, pleasing bitterness, giving the tongue a nice coating of saliva, eagerly wanting more.

Six Rivers Loaders Light;McKinleyville, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Six Rivers Brewery;"(Draft: Six Rivers Brewery in McKinleyville, CA) For a ""light"" beer, this is actually pretty flavorful. Showing mild grain and gently bitter hops, this beer maintains flavor for a long, pleasant finish. Light in body, but far from being watery. Medium straw in color with a nearly white head, wide rings of lace are left on the glass. If this is their light beer, I think I’m in for some very tasty brews in this sampler."

Six Rivers Bluff Creek Pale Ale;McKinleyville, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Six Rivers Brewery;Tap. Pours clear golden, small white head, decent lacing.

Six Rivers Bluff Creek Pale Ale;McKinleyville, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Six Rivers Brewery;Bottle from Pizza Port bottle shop: Poured a golden honey color with a fizzy short lived head. Aroma is a perfume scented base of hops and had some organic earth notes to it. The flavor is a bland and empty taste with only a minor touch of malt liquor style malting and a puny amateur hopping added in. Almost no carbonation present at all which made it less like a beer and more like a malt breakfast beverage. Not even worth a six pack, so glad I was able to buy a single.
Six Rivers Bluff Creek Pale Ale;McKinleyville, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Six Rivers Brewery;Well, this smells and looks fine, but otherwise it’s terrible. An immediate sour bite to it, which is even enough to override the hops, which are fairly abundant for a pale ale. Some strange fruitiness as well, but the skunkiness wins out.
Six Rivers Bluff Creek Pale Ale;McKinleyville, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Six Rivers Brewery;Bottle: &nbsp Fiery amber, thin sudsy white head, sparce lacing. &nbsp Moderate hop nose, a bit of citrus and pith. &nbsp Slight earthiness. &nbsp Similar on the tongue. &nbsp A bit sharp on the backside, a little astringent. &nbsp Not a real smooth example, but certainly hoppy. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate. &nbsp A bit rough on the finish, too green perhaps?

Six Rivers Blarney Stout;McKinleyville, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Six Rivers Brewery;At The Local Beer Bar in Eureka, CA. This draft pour came a dark black color with good sized creamy off-white nitro head. The nose is roasted malts with coffee and chocolate. The body is medium and the mouthfeel clean and smooth. The flavor is first dominated by the coffee, and it finishes lightly bitter and with the chocolate showing more.. The nitro makes this very easy drinking and enjoyable.
Six Rivers Blarney Stout;McKinleyville, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Six Rivers Brewery;Sample at the brewpub. Clear brown with a thin beige head. Aroma is roast and diacetyl with a bit of chocolate. Flavor of diacetyl, fruit and roasted malt. Kinda thin and odd.

Six Rivers Blarney Stout;McKinleyville, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Six Rivers Brewery;"(Draft: Six Rivers Brewery in McKinleyville, CA) This is a pretty pale looking stout. It’s mahogany in color, but somewhat translucent and certainly lighter in color than the porter. It smells somewhat roasty, but actually more toasty than anything. Though billed as an Irish stout, it is a dry, toasty, and very chocolaty stout with a modest smokiness and a noticeable hop flavor, and is certainly less roasty than most Irish stouts. Medium ""plus"" body seems about right for the amount of flavor the beer possesses. The light tan head gradually fades away to a rim, leaving some patchy lacing on the glass. Overall, a nice stout, a different interpretation of the Irish style for sure, but enjoyable in its own right."
Six Rivers Blarney Stout;McKinleyville, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Six Rivers Brewery;standard, decent dry stout. powder coffee aroma, tastes like porridge and cream mixed with chocolate and then seriously watered down
Six Rivers Blarney Stout;McKinleyville, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Six Rivers Brewery;Tap@Six Rivers. Pretty refreshing to have this one after the Chilli beer, but still a bit too timid for a stout, lightly acidic, reasonably dry, hints of coffee and chocolate.

Sweet, with burnt sugar bitterness. Heavy body with a slightly cloying sweetness. Sugars seem to be caramelized. Bitter finish with some harshness. Hops are not much in evidence. Overall, more of an imperial scotch ale than an imperial IPA, but too treacly and too sticky to be a great one.

Six Rivers Sasquatch;McKinleyville, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Six Rivers Brewery;On draft at Tap 25. I’ve scrolled past this one many times due to the low style rating. I’m glad I finally tried it, because I was pleasantly surprised. Kind of. It pours a dark reddish orange color with an off white head. The aroma has malt and fruit with a little toffee and strong floral hops. The flavor has more thick fruity malts with big floral bitterness. From the looks of the color of this beer, I thought it was going to be a sweet crystal malt mess, but somehow they managed to get it finishing dry which was nice. It actually ironically reminds me a bit of Bigfoot without the caramel/toffee flavors. Unfortunately, neither the hop or malt character really excite me all that much. Better than expected.
Six Rivers Sasquatch;McKinleyville, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Six Rivers Brewery;Pours a cloudy amber with a nice head. Aroma is citrucy fruit apricots upfront dominate the aroma with some slight tangerines and or Orange notes. Taste follows the aroma. With as medium to heavy mouth feel. To be honest this beer Taste like carbonated apricot juice.
Wild River Honey Wheat;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Wild River Brewing Company;"On tap at the brewpub in Grants Pass OR.

Wild River Honey Wheat;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Wild River Brewing Company;Tap@Wild River, Cave Junction, Oregon. Aaaah, the dreaded Honey Wheat, whenever i see the name ’honey wheat’ in a beers name, two words come to mind, bland and sweet. My opinions haven’t changed after having this beer. You can definitely taste the honey, but its not overly sweet, pretty bland and boring.
Wild River Schwarzbier;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wild River Brewing Company;i dunno, i can´t imagine this would sell well in germany. cauliflower aroma, not particularly schwarz, brown sugar and cocoa powder, light tinny finish
Wild River Schwarzbier;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wild River Brewing Company;Tap@Wild river, Cave Junction, Oregon.

Wild River Double Kölsch;Grants Pass, Oregon, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Wild River Brewing Company;one of the more bizarre ideas for a beer that i encountered in america. i was wondering how they would translate koelsch dryness into a beer of such strenght but it seems like they didn´t worry too much about that. big metho aroma, some melon and tinniness and raw alcohol finish

Glossop Summer Bitter;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Glossop Breweries;Cask, at Newark Beer Festival, May 2004. Notes recovered from a recently unearthed old notebook. Gold colour. A little better than the Fletchers Campaign from the same brewery that I tasted at the same festival, but not much. In retrospect, I probably shouldn’t have risked this but I thought the first beer must have been an off batch. Unfortunately that wasn’t the case. Although the aroma did not have the acetone that I found in the Fletchers Campaign, this was replaced by a very grainy, sweaty, under-brewed malt character. And there was the same sourness in the flavour suggesting infection problems at the brewery. Drinkable (just) but hardly enjoyable.
Glossop Summer Bitter;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Glossop Breweries;Cask Handpump at the Crown Inn, Stockport 04/06/2004 Clear golden and sour flavoured. Bitter slightly dry lasting malt finish.
Glossop Summer Bitter;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Glossop Breweries;cask, old moot hall, nottingham. the second beer from this newish brewery on tap at the local within days of the first being withdrawn. as i remember this was too. both were really not nice, almost cidric with metal and sulpher thrown in. would recommend a taste before embarking on a pint. of course it could have been a bad batch, or bad transport (certainly nothing to do with the pub) because both beers tasted similarly strange. having thought about it, i find it hard to imagine a new brewer would thing it was suitable to sell in the state it was in, thus giving me hope that it was a rogue batch, so do not take my word as gospel.

The mainpart remains like this, a light bitterness that becomes more intense to the end sits nicely in. The aftertaste is malty, slightly bitter and a bit malty-sweetish.

Cox & Holbrook Beyton Bitter;Stowmarket, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cox & Holbrook;Darkish amber colour. The aroma is dominated by rather dusty malt. The flavours are predominantly malt too, but quite dry. Not very bitter. Quite chewy for a session bitter. Not bad. cask (gravity), Thurrock Beer Festival.
Cox & Holbrook Beyton Bitter;Stowmarket, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cox & Holbrook;Thurrock Beer Fest. A muddy, almost brown amber colour. A warm, sort of brown tasting bitter with faint chocolate notes. A cross between a stout and a bitter - very attractive.
Ringneck Dunkelweizen;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;The Brew Kettle;Sample at TBK. Menu calls it Herbst Weisen, but the online tap list calls it Dunkelweizen. Clear copper pour with a thick tan head. Aroma of banana, clove, bread and caramel. Banana and clove flavor with some caramel before a bready finish.
Ringneck Dunkelweizen;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;The Brew Kettle;Strong initial banana aroma. The flavor is very boring. Thin, a bit of malt, very thin. Metallic, not good beer.
Ringneck Dunkelweizen;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;The Brew Kettle;This poured a dark red color with an off white head. Aroma was roasted malts, some clovey spices and darker fruit. Flavor was was rich chewy roasted malts followed by nice dark fruit and spices from the wheat. Above my expectations.
Ringneck Dunkelweizen;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;The Brew Kettle;Draft sample at Brew Kettle. Poured a clear orange/brown color with a large off-white head that was mostly lasting and produced fair lacing. Good banana and spice aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Good hefe sweet flavor with an average sweet finish of moderate duration. Soft drinkable brew.
Ringneck Dunkelweizen;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;The Brew Kettle;On draft@Brew Kettle. Cloudy dark orange-brow pour wearing a vague off-white head for a wheat beer. I like how the aroma manages to combine both toastiness and roastiness in a competent unisson. Nevertheless, it quickly becomes buttery, oily and this is less pleasant, limiting the malt development. Wheaty indeed, but feeling like cookies, with subtle chocolate notes. It keeps on packing small malt nuances, but the yeastiness is vague, lacking in character which makes any weizen mostly insipid. Medium bodied, with almost creamy and full carbonation.
Ringneck Dunkelweizen;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;The Brew Kettle;I now officially love The Brew Kettle. This is a beatiful beer with a rick cloudy ruby topped off with a thick, dense, off-white head. The aroma is strongly of caramel and bananas. The banana in the flavor is almost breath-taking, but the finish is a bit short. This could probably stand for a bit more clove from the yeast to balance out the esters, but still an excellent dunkelweizen. I don’t think I could tell it from a good German-brewed one on a blind taste test. The main drawback is that it lacks that creamy palate of the best hefeweizens and dunkelweizens.
Ringneck Dunkelweizen;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;The Brew Kettle;"Deep amber copper hue with big frothy off-white head and excellent lace. The aroma had notes of lemongrass, lime, banana ester, caramel toasted malts, floral hops, and bittersweet chocolate. The taste starts fruity and wheaty, banana and lemon taste mostly. Undertone of mocha, sublime spice and grains towards finish. The feel is smooth, dry and lively; chalky upon finish. Overall it’s a quaffable brew than hints of all things in style, but ultimately needs to be bolder in presentation. A worthy effort which has potential."
Ringneck Dunkelweizen;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;The Brew Kettle;"Lasting frothy light beige head, very hazy brown body. Light banana ester & hints of chocolate, very light hints of clove a lightly medicinal chloraseptic/band aid aroma. Also some slight wheat and munich malts. Every part of the aroma is light. Banana esters dominate at first, but fade quickly and the entire beer falls flat on the palate. Well balanced but after the initial flavor, it goes away; light wheat flavor & hints of clove at best. Finish is a bit tart and dry, aftertaste is void. There really isn’t any of which to speak. Highly carbonated & smooth, lighter body. this beer needs more of everything. Not completely tasteless, but would be a good beginner beer for people who ""don’t like wheat beer or dark beers""."
Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;IPA - English;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Not on vid, but based on checklist. Smell- weak, orange, citrus, hops maybe. Foam- thin, sweet, some hops, and bitter notes what creep up, orange notes. Head is medium, can pour full bottle in pint glass straight up, maybe it is mall then ? My ratings are inconsistent... head is creamy yellow, orange white color. Appearance- hazy orange, brown, amber, some carbonation. Taste- bitter-sweet, but in good way, orange, citrus, sweetness, some pulling sweetness, yeast. Very interesting one, I enjoy it.
Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;IPA - English;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Sept 2019 330ml bottle, some residue, from BeerWulf. I like this. Quite malty with a sweet body, touches of age to it. Some hop awareness, but not overwhelming the malt at all. I like malty beers so this is my sort of thing. A very satisfying sipping beer. Not sure about the recreation of Edo period beers though, as they were lagers made by Dutch brewers, and didn't use modern hops!

Arôme d’agrumes, de coriande et de céréales. Le goût est celui des agrumes, du blé et du pain. Elle ne se démarque pas des autres witbier, mais au prix qu’elle coûte, c’est un bon investissement.
Dieu du Ciel! MonKriek;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Ruby red color with a very thin head. Pretty decent aroma and flavor of cherries with medium acidity. Not bad but I feel DDC could have done much better. (The tasting took place at the Mondial 2004 but I misplaced the notes and just stumbled into them, I really have to clean up more often !)
Dieu du Ciel! MonKriek;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;On tap at the Mondial de la Bière 2004: Glowing ruby red color with a thin off-white head. Aroma is semi-sweet and semi-tart with plenty of cherry fruitiness, but lacking any aged complexity. Body starts with a touch of fruit syrup sweetness turning slightly more acidic toward the finish. Has some merlot-like wine qualities, but could be more balanced for a kriek.
Dieu du Ciel! MonKriek;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;(Draught) Nose of jarred sour cherries with sweet strawberry jam. Pours a thin pink head with a clear, red body. Nice tart flavour of cherries without the fizziness. Not chappingly sour ~ a mellow finish. Good.
Dieu du Ciel! MonKriek;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Dark ruby red in colour. Aroma of cherries, slight sourness and tartness. Flavour was mildly sour, lots of dark cherries, slightly dry and tart. Medium bodied. Finishes dry and a little thin. Pretty good but Dieu du Ciel can make this a whole lot better.
Dieu du Ciel! MonKriek;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Rosy smallish head, ruby red. Sweet, fruity bready Kriek .This medium bodied brew had plenty full of cherries. Nice true feel, left good impression on me.
Dieu du Ciel! MonKriek;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Lightly sour buttered cherries in the aroma. Reddish-brown, with decent pink head that diminishes fully. Mild, cherries and buttery diacetyl. A bit tart in the finish. Fairly light. Good carbonation. Not so much an oud bruin/kriek as a fruit beer and diacetyl seems way too high. Somewhat disappointing. On tap at Mondial 2004.
Dieu du Ciel! MonKriek;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Monidal-Deep coolaid red color with a small white lacing around the rim. Sweet cherry aroma. Sour/tart cherry flavor.
Dieu du Ciel! MonKriek;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Draft. Ruby read with a cream soda like pinkish head. Vinuous red wine notes in the nose. Initial sourness quickly gives way to a slightly sweet cherry. Not much to it really. Moderate body. Bit of a disappointment but not unpleasant. Mondiale 2T (Me).
Dieu du Ciel! MonKriek;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;"Deep ruby red body, almost clear with a pinkih head. Aroma is rather appealing with flowers, cherries, slight woody undertones (branches), vanilla and mild spices (ginger, cloves). It seems well orchestrated from sniffing, but the taste is poor with a very low acidity level, no sharpness nor focus. Very simple cherry oriented flavor. Not approaching an our bruin with an almost grainy character at times. Fruit beer: Thin and watery, admirable accessibility; uninteresting study."
Dieu du Ciel! MonKriek;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Sweet cherry syrup boiled up and mixed with butter...This diacetyl works in the aroma and is thankfully invisible once imbibed...A little acidity garners the palate and some of that cherry sweetness as well...I am a little disappointed as this was billed as an Oud Bruin brewed with cherries, but what I am getting is only a cherry fruit beer...Of course, this is the beer commissioned by the Mondiale de la Bière festival, thus it smells of compromise...I am curious to see where this recipe is going to take them...
Dieu du Ciel! Dernière Volonté;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;It pours golden and clear with very tight beading in the head. The head is white with very good head retention. It has strong earthly aromas with barnyard elements. Leather is also prominent with a very light floral note. The flavors are strong with leather and earthly elements. There are also floral notes and a low level of flowers. Spicy flavors are in support with very low levels of fruit. It has a medium body with slight alcohol warming. Overall, the brett is the strongest single element in the beer with the other elements in the background.
Dieu du Ciel! Dernière Volonté;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Smells like toilet paper that has been stuck in my ass all day and then falls out of my underware looking like mini splifs. It taste nothing like belgian beer more like ice cream melting on the sidewalk in st jerome. Its ok to give this beer to all the montreal canadians management because it makes you brain dead. Ps pk suban left a case of beer to them

Dieu du Ciel! Dernière Volonté;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Couleur dorée limpide avec une mousse abondante et tenace. Effectivement, le nez est bien funky comme il faut avec des notes brettées à souhait. Bien sèche en bouche avec une carbo bien violente. Notes de levures un peu âcres en fin de bouche. L'aspect IPA me laisse bien dubitatif... On perçoit un petit quelque chose de zeste de citron, mais plus globalement de fruité sur les agrumes qui parvient à lisser l'ensemble. Les bretts réapparaissent quant à elles en fin de bouche après avoir fait acte de présence dès l'entrée. Propre.
Dieu du Ciel! Dernière Volonté;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Bottle from K&L in Redwood City, CA. Aroma is mild fruit, maybe apricot, loads of funky Brett, attic bones, moldy stone fruit. Taste is bready, dried apricots (without any sour notes), dry and funky wood (maybe coffin?) with a spicy, yeasty finish that persists deep down. Very goth and erotic.
Dieu du Ciel! Dernière Volonté;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Aroma: notes of belgian ale yeast, some mustiness, village, some lambic-style notes, funky notes, peach, aprictot, floral notes.

Tightly cobweb-lacing, moussy and foamy, snow white head, initially as good as clear, warm and deep golden blonde robe with lively sparkling, misty with sediment. Aroma of overripe yellow plums, sweet red apple soaking in molten butter, gooseberry yoghurt, sweat, soggy white bread, honey, feta, old stale orange juice, goat cheese, wodka, vanilla. Fruiy, estery onset, ripe pear, gooseberry jam and starfruit notes, sweet with a sourish edge, creamy body coarsened initially by very sharp, numbing carbonation; pleasantly rounded, doughy, malt sweet middle, bit buttery with a thin layer of honeyish sweetness on top, shifting towards a long, leafy, earthy and cheesy hop bitter finish, peppery with hayish and leathery Brettanomyces notes blending in very well, with a dash of warming, gin-like alcohol in the end. The plum and honey sweetish notes as well as the butteriness linger a bit. Pleasant and interesting 'Bretted' Belgian style ale, good balance of sweet, sour and bitter with the sweetness prevailing; should improve and gain more complexity with cellaring."

Mia and Pias 50 Anniversary Lager;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;renamed Scream Eagle: light, but very drinkable, especially with pizza, in a style I’ll usually pass on. Not too shabby...

Fenland Smokestack Lightning;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Mild Ale;Fenland Brewery;Gravity, Merton Beer Festival. Very dark brown, almost opaque, fine layer of off-white head. Rustic earthy bread aroma, lightly roasty, light caramel. Simple, but attractive. Earthy bread flavor, just a little smoke, some copper penny pinging around in the background, but in this case it’s a nice thing. Light body, but not thin. A solid mild, not a shocker, but hearty and satisfying.
Fenland Smokestack Lightning;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Mild Ale;Fenland Brewery;Cask at Merton Summer Beer Festival 07-07-07. Poured very dark brown without much of a head, great smokey aroma which then followed through into the mouth. This was a jolly good Mild that tasted nice malty and ’roasty smokey’ but for some reason it never quite lived up to expectations.
Fenland Smokestack Lightning;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Mild Ale;Fenland Brewery;500ml bottle from brewery stall at Ely Market. Very dark brown with sparse beige ehad. Very attractive choc/coffee aroma. Some juicyness in mouth. Then very pleasant choc mousse flavour comes through. Very attractive mild. Good structure.

Fenland Smokestack Lightning;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Mild Ale;Fenland Brewery;From bottle. A very deep dark colour, hint of red, with slight carb. It has a smokey syrup aroma. As I taste it reminds me of smokey charcoal. Overall, not to bad, I feel there is a good beer here trying to get out.
Fenland Smokestack Lightning;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Mild Ale;Fenland Brewery;Bottle Conditioned, 500ml. Black with copper hue, tan head. A tobacco aroma and initial taste again from the bottle conditioned version, but in this case the hoppiness comes through with a fruity, malty body too. Develops into a decent mild, shame about the initial flavour.
Fenland Smokestack Lightning;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Mild Ale;Fenland Brewery;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Bedford BF. A black mild with a tiny wisp of a tan head. The aroma is fruity with sweet roasted malts. The taste is also on the fruity side with some lactose. Full bodied and to me verging on a sweet stout. The best of the milds I rated at the fest.
Fenland Sparkling Wit;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fenland Brewery;Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. Dark gold. Quite an exotic aroma with pear, gooseberry and vanilla. Lovely, lasting fruity taste with wheaty overtones. A little bitterness. It slid down effortlessly. I thought this was a real winner.
Fenland Sparkling Wit;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fenland Brewery;"Cask at Cambridge Blue. Pale bitter, thin in body and lacking much flavour. Curiously ""fizzy"" sensation in the mouth. A bit weird."
Fenland Sparkling Wit;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fenland Brewery;A Sim Rate (Cask at Planet Thanet): Smells like a curry. Cumin, coriander. Tastes smoky... like a wit version of Schlenkerla Rauchbier. Very bizarre. Wit, but rauch, but wit. Very nice.
Fenland Sparkling Wit;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fenland Brewery;500ml bottle from Brewery stall at Ely Market. Gold/copper colour with lasting white head. Rubbery aroma like all the beers I had in this batch apart from the raspberry stout which was fine. Good citrusy finish. OK in mouth, wheat gives it some depth. Lemony citrus finish. Fine, except for the aroma.
Fenland Sparkling Wit;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fenland Brewery;Bottle conditioned, 500ml, from St Ives Farmers Market. Gold colour with white head. Moving up the ABV of Fenland bottled beers the better it gets. Initial dry, herby taste then a sweetish fruit note, lemony, grapefruit. Better through the bottle. Not a White beer though.
Fenland Sparkling Wit;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fenland Brewery;Cask handpump at the Swan in the Rushes, Loughborough. It is seriously misleading calling this a wit. Sort of golden with a slight haze. Very fruity, thin bodied, but grew on me as it went down. Strange but interesting.
Fenland Sparkling Wit;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fenland Brewery;"Not really what I was expecting from a ""white"" beer. There were some fresh grassy notes in the aroma, but also some cereally shredded wheat accents. The flavour was quite clean but not particularly wheaty, and even had vague smoky hints. Not bad, just not what I expected. Cask (gravity dispense) at Peterborough Beer Festival."
Fenland Sparkling Wit;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fenland Brewery;Cask conditioned - hanpump - Anchor Birmingham. A golden beer with a slight haze.

Fenland Osier Cutter;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fenland Brewery;Bottle Conditioned, 500ml, from Farmers Market in St Ives. Gold colour highly effervescent.

Some citric fruit and a leafy oily hop note. Just not great in the bottle.

Kellys Brewpub Apricot Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Draft at Grasshopper. Crystal clear golden color. Stonefruit aroma. Taste is subtle fruit. Soft sweetness
Kellys Brewpub Apricot Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Can pours hazy golden color, tight white head vanishes quickly leaving minimal lace. Aromas of apricot and peach. Taste of sweet hard candies and artificial apricot flavoring. Light body, watery mouthfeel,under carbonated with a medicinal finish on the tongue. I don’t think I can drink another one. The fake fruit flavors paired with the extremely light body make this almost undrinkable.

Aroma of perfumy apricot. Flavor of sweet, still perfumy apricot and light wheat malt. Very sweet, certainly artificially sweet.

Kellys Brewpub Apricot Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Pretty simple, but I would have it again. You really taste very little but apricot here. Maybe a bit of peach but almost no wheat at all.
Kellys Brewpub Apricot Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Pours a clear golden brown with minimal head. Nose is the sweetest apricot the Earth ever produced. If it tastes as good as it smells, this will be good. Flavor is very well balanced. For using such a distinct fruit, the taste is well done. Not overdone by any means, but distinct and full. Feel is standard and overall it is highly drinkable. A very even fruit beer, though I know they just add the flavoring and don’t use actual fruit.
Kellys Brewpub Apricot Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Pours a cloduy yellow/brown or what you could call a dirty yellow. Nice pleasant aroma of apricot. Floral and slightly perfumey. Taste is light apricot with mild hops. Finishes crisp and clean. Nice.
Kellys Brewpub Apricot Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Golden-apricot color body. Big apricot aroma, even when cold. Enticing, but hints of concentrated apricot juice rather than the fruit itself. Refreshing apricot flavor with a decent malty underbelly. Has none of the off-flavors that are common in too many Kelly’s brews. Good.
White Star Battleaxe;Southampton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;White Star;Bottled. Amber colour, huge head, big particles of yeast floating around. Aroma is fruits, floral notes mild wooden notes as well as some acidic notes. Flavour is fruity, floral, a bit yeasty. Otherwise a quite nice thing.
White Star Battleaxe;Southampton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;White Star;BCA (from Bottles of Botley). Certainly not the worst white star beer I’ve had but not great. Smoky caramelised malt flavours with slight sourness. Just about drinkable in a masochistic kind of way.
White Star Battleaxe;Southampton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;White Star;Bottle. Golden, orange with floaties and an off-white foam. Aromas are caramel malts with toffee and sour fruit - I assumed it is tainted, although looking at the other ratings, possibly not. Flavours are sweet and sour with oranges. Fairly hoppy. Still seems tainted to me.
White Star Battleaxe;Southampton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;White Star;Bottle Conditioned, 500ml. Flat orange brown, no head, cloudy. I had seen Gazza’s rating of this before I opened it and I was hoping that the BC version would be better, but no, there was a sharp acidic nose on opening and a flat sludgey liqued poured out, and yes I was very careful how it was poured. The beer was torpid, yeasty, heavy in tobacco type flavours and basically awful. I checked the BBE and it was April 2006 and it was stored (after purchase) in my normal place, this is just a bad beer and I couldn’t finish it, rare for me!!
White Star Battleaxe;Southampton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;White Star;Horrible phenolic burnt caramelised fluid bearing no resemblance to beer. (Cask from Babbington, Derby)
