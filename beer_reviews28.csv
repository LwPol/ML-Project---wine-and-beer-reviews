MacParker's Ale;Ithaca                         ,New York,United States;Pale Ale - English;Ithaca Beer Co.;Copper colour with absolutely no head. Mild hop aroma with balanced malt. Decent english hop taste mixed with a citrus/lemony taste. Aftertaste a bit metallic,not half bad though. Overall,a decent EPA,not too great though. I had this on draught at MacGregor's in Rochester,New York on 28-October-2003.
Five Islands Strawberry Blonde;North Wollongong,NSW     ,Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Illawarra Brewing Company;"Felt like a fool ordering this but I've never had strawberry beer so I couldn't not have it. Could find no strawberry character at all. Aroma of dodgy homebrew (yeasty). Not much flavour besides a nice, clean sourness presumably from the fruit. Reminded me of a mild Berliner Weisse or something. Refreshing enough but hardly exciting. Extra points for their description: ""Finally, a beer designed for the female market. We have infused a very lightly hopped pale ale with strawberries in the brew kettle to produce a beer that has sweet characteristics yet not the calories."" hehe"
Five Islands Strawberry Blonde;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Illawarra Brewing Company;in a surprising display of honesty, the brewmaster wouldn't serve filthmuppet a glass of this,saying it was awful. i had a a small sample and had to agree. looked just like a standard premium lager with some nasty fruit tella in the aroma. tasted of redskins with something nasty and metallic lurking in the background
Five Islands Lighthouse Light;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Illawarra Brewing Company;On Tap at the Five Islands Brewery. Arrived golden yellow with a chilled haze and a small frothy, white head which was average lasting. Aroma was of sweet musty malts with honey, brewing sugar, hints of diacetyl and a touch of mandarin. Flavor was of sweet malts with a light bitterness, honey, wet cardboard and a metallic finish. Light bodied with lively carbonation, a dry mouthfeel, watery texture and a short finish. Much more dinkable than most light beers.
Five Islands Lighthouse Light;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Illawarra Brewing Company;Looks like a light beer and yes it tastes like a light beer regardless what the blurb says. Been there and done that.
Five Islands Lighthouse Light;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Illawarra Brewing Company;This beer was infected. It tasted very sour and had a musky middle palate. Not refreshing at all. Didn�t drink the rest. Possible wild yeast infection unfortunately.
Five Islands Lighthouse Light;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Illawarra Brewing Company;i'll give this a couple of bonus points for being the first light beer i've ever drunk that i could actually conceive of drinking again. quite full-bodied with fresh oily hops
Five Islands Lighthouse Light;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Illawarra Brewing Company;sweet and honeyish, with crisp lemony finish, like a k�lsch with half the alcohol. nobbad.
Five Islands Parkyns Shark Oil;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;IPA;Illawarra Brewing Company;Had on tap at brewery Lighter style IPA. Light shade of orange. Lots of resin and orange in the smell. Fairly light bodied and not overy hopped. More of the oils from the hops. Oh well. It was decent though
Five Islands Parkyns Shark Oil;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;IPA;Illawarra Brewing Company;On tap at the FIBC. Lack of prescribed aroma, only just enough bitterness for an IPA with aluminium and yeasty off-flavours dominating quality of this product.
Five Islands Parkyns Shark Oil;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;IPA;Illawarra Brewing Company;(On tap @ Local Taphouse Spectapular) Looks like I�ll be the outlier here. I thought this beer showed well as a lighter IPA style. Very subtle and dry throughtout, and the light herbal hops, partlicularly in the back palate, showed a fair bit of class. Definately a better keg on this tasting than previous notes would suggest.
Five Islands Parkyns Shark Oil;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;IPA;Illawarra Brewing Company;On tap at brewery. So so awful. Aptly named, as I can�t imagine a glass of shark oil would taste much worse. In fact, I�d probably risk a swig of shark oil to wipe out the aftertaste.
Five Islands Parkyns Shark Oil;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;IPA;Illawarra Brewing Company;Trid as a sampler at the brewery. The taste lets down the expectation of the wonderful fresh hop aroma. Slightly dull floral taste, a little thin, good bitterness at the end.
Five Islands Parkyns Shark Oil;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;IPA;Illawarra Brewing Company;RE-RATE: On Tap at the Five Islands Brewery, 5%. I let this warm about an hour prior to tasting. Arrived hazy orangey copper with a dense foamy head which lasted superbly. An odd spicy/wattle hop aroma with notes of roses, sweet caramel malts, passion fruit, peach nectar and a touch of butterscotch. Flavor was a moderate floral hop bitterness with sharp rustic/metallic notes, dry biscuity malts, caramel, passionfruit, mandarin and some resin in the finish. Light to medium bodied with soft carbonation, a dry/resiny mouthfeel and an average finish. Better than first time around, seemed just a tiny bit hoppyer.
Five Islands Parkyns Shark Oil;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;IPA;Illawarra Brewing Company;strong hop bitterness up front. that smell of high alpha hops maybe chinook? first sip starts sweetish but finishes dry and resiny bitter. not much yeast personality but a definately an ale. nice drop and if you have the palate for it an all night drinker, but not for the first time craft beer drinker.
Five Islands Parkyns Shark Oil;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;IPA;Illawarra Brewing Company;strangely oily aroma but otherwise unaromatic. some bitterness hits you first and then some honeyed sweetness. from chatting with the brewer, it is apparent that he likes a lot of hops but the good folk of wollongong perhaps aren't ready for them in large doses. quite a lagery texture - not ale-like at all and could do with more guts
Five Islands Parkyns Shark Oil;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;IPA;Illawarra Brewing Company;smells heavily of diacetyl and not much else, maybe a trace of hops. flavour is similarly afflicted - i know i said on a recent forum post that i like diacetyl, well, not in IPAs. flavour is heaps of sweet honey butter with pungent peppery bitterness. texture is way too syruppy and sickly.
Five Islands Halloween Ale;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Flavored - Other;Illawarra Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Wasn�t a big fan of this one, but was still ok. Pours a golden orange, with a small off white head. Not much in the aroma, taste is quite strong pumpkin pulp, a very light cinnamon, and toffee.
Five Islands Halloween Ale;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Flavored - Other;Illawarra Brewing Company;Draught at The Local Taphouse, Melbourne. Appears rusty orange with a small white head. Lightly spiced on the nose and sweet sugars. Doughy malt and pumpkin flavour. Sweet and bitter finish. An interesting beer and first pumpkin ale I�ve tried.
Five Islands Halloween Ale;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Flavored - Other;Illawarra Brewing Company;i liked this one - mainly for being something i'm sure has never been brewed in this country before. the brewer said he roasted a very large amount of pumpkin for it to get the sugars out. looked light brown with a bit of cookie dough aroma. hint of pumpkin flavour and some extra butteriness of texture. odd, with a pleasantly integrated finish
Five Islands Halloween Ale;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Flavored - Other;Illawarra Brewing Company;apparently made with pumpkin, cumin, cinnamon, and some other stuff. red-orange colour. toffee and cumin smells are pissed all over by lots of escapees from the big cat section. if you block your nose, the flavour is very sweet, pumpkiny, with plenty of spice, and some late bitterness. An odd one, maybe appropriately scary.
Five Islands Pigdog Pilsener;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Illawarra Brewing Company;By the numbers pilsener lager style beer. Not a lot of aroma, appearence is straw with little head. Flavour is good, solid sessional beer.
Five Islands Pigdog Pilsener;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Illawarra Brewing Company;Draught at The Australian Hotel, Sydney. I�m pretty sure this was the FI beer I had, it wasn�t acutally labelled. The beer was an attempt at a Pils so I�ll put my rating here. Pours clear golden with a small and lively white head. Aroma of pale malt and fruity hops. The flavour is malt and light citrus. Not really clean for a pils but it�s unoffensive and easy to drink. It�s OK.
Five Islands Pigdog Pilsener;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Illawarra Brewing Company;Murky orange with a small head. Tasted lke an APA at first with all the citrus but then the nice salty pils came through. Quite chewy and long with a very dry finish.
Five Islands Pigdog Pilsener;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Illawarra Brewing Company;Not as tasty as the Paddys Pilsener I had a couple days beforehand but still it�s to style and it got better after I had eaten, maybe a touch sweet for me.
Five Islands Pigdog Pilsener;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Illawarra Brewing Company;RE-RATE: Bottle (330ml). Poured yellow with a small, rocky, white head which was average lasting. Aroma was of lemon citrus with bitters, honey, lime, sweet malts and light grassy/hoppy notes. Flavor was of sweet grainy malts, with lemon citrus, lime citrus, a light hop bitterness , touch of butterscotch and a dry finish. Light bodied with lively carbonation, a dry mouthfeel, somewhat watery texture and a ok finish. Just was to sweet for me, reminds me of lemon, lime & bitters more than anything.
Five Islands Pigdog Pilsener;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Illawarra Brewing Company;Clear yellowish gold with a loose frothy head and fine carbonation. Some nice grassy hops, with a bit of a metal touch. Quite malty too, which brings the sweetness level up a little. Somewhat shallow and short, and not a greatly challenging beer, but quite drinkable. (On tap, not quite as good from the green bottle!!).
Five Islands Pigdog Pilsener;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Illawarra Brewing Company;Bottle. Probably better than i expected it to be. Grassy aroma, with some lightly honeyed characters. Some light sweetness on the tongue, with a touch of bitter hops. Some underlying buttery notes. Finish is a bit crisp.
Five Islands Pigdog Pilsener;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Illawarra Brewing Company;Bottle (Sydney Summer Gathering 2007): First beer of the gathering and unfortunately it was a little worse for having spent its life in a light green bottle. Slightly hazy gold without much head. What really stood out about this was the skunked grassy and grainy aroma that otherwise showed a great deal of promise. In the mouth it was prett typical with a watery sweet grain note accompanied by some pleasant grassiness and a crisp, though slightly harsh bitterness. From the keg or with a brown bottle this could hold up nicely.
Five Islands Pigdog Pilsener;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Illawarra Brewing Company;Looking beyond the fact that this bottle was a bit skunked, there was a decent amount of bitterness, fairly crisp and clean tasting, though with a hint of diacetyl. Credible effort.
Five Islands Pigdog Pilsener;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Illawarra Brewing Company;Perhaps it was the environment - a sunlit table outside the Australian Hotel on beer festival weekend with the AFL Grand Final to look forward to later - or perhaps it was the rare opportunity to drink fresh pilsener. Either way, I was pretty impressed with this and with the Five Islands range in general. This one had a loose, sudsy head that spackled the glass. There was some butterscotch diacetyl in the aroma but nothing overpowering - for my palate, at least. Also lime marmalade and Saazy notes. Quite an oily mouthfeel and dry in the finish. In the mouth, it�s all diacetyl caramel up-front with some Saaz spice and a long soft, bitter finish. Fresh, this was very drinkable. (Draught at the Australian Hotel beer festival, Sydney, 2006)

Ritter Pils;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Sampled from 0.5 l bottle from �Rudat�, best before May 2018. Clear, golden yellow with a thin, frothy, almost stable, white head. Very faint, sweetish, slightly grassy aroma of grains and traces of straw. Moderately sweet, slightly bitter, a little grassy taste of grains and a touch of straw, followed by a short, moderately bitter, slightly grassy and rather dry finish. Thin to medium body, slightly effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Very bland, not any better than the stuff from the discounters.

""Hopfenherb Aromatisch"" steht schon sinnigerweise auf dem Label, aber das ist dann f�r mich doch zuviel des guten, zumal hier weniger Aromahopfen als vielmehr die Hopfenextraktkeule geschwungen wird. Freunde der norddt. Pilsener sollten es mal antesten. Fazit: Kann man durchaus mal zischen, muss man aber nicht! Test vom 9.1.2007, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 12,9,6,6,3,8 - 7,70"

Black Forest Brau Keller Stout;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Stout;Black Forest Brau Keller;Dark and headless, this stout offers some roastiness and hints of coffee, but is very wateryand thin.
Black Forest Brau Keller Brown Ale;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Black Forest Brau Keller;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a slight glossy brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Lacing was somewhat sticky but ended up sliding for the most part. The smell had a fairly nice roasty nutty to caramel to coffee to chocolatey sort of thing going on. Slightly malty sweet through a roasty underscore of a toasted toffee to caramel breadiness all around. The taste was there and it was mainly sweet but had a light roastiness all around and invasive but actually it wanted to be. Was it? Hmmm...I guess for the most part. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. The carbonation finishes fairly smooth and leads to a stickiness I�m not normally finding in a whole lot of brown ales in the finish. Weird, but inoffensive. Overall, brown ale, it sure is, its just a tad different in the mouthfeel/palate to me, but hey still worthy of having again.
Black Forest Brau Keller Brown Ale;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Black Forest Brau Keller;Hazy orange amber color with thin white. Mild malty aroma. Slight roasted notes. Mild coffee notes on the palate with cocoa hints.
Black Forest Brau Keller Brown Ale;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Black Forest Brau Keller;Pours a deep reddish brown with a quite thin tan head (at least from the growler, which tends to flatten beers a bit so it may be thicker from the tap). A hint of barley mixes with a hint of malt in the nose. Bitter overall taste with alcohol coming out a little strong (odd if it is really 5% like the description says), but lacking in much else.
Black Forest Brau Keller Brown Ale;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Black Forest Brau Keller;Thin, watery dark amber color. Sweet nutty nose, but barely a hint of malt in the mouth. Light bodied and nearly tasteless, but hints of hops in the finish.
Black Forest Brau Keller Pale Ale;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Forest Brau Keller;On draft at brewery. This one is called No Fail Pale Ale with 5% ABV and 37 IBU. Gold color with lasting off white head and decent lacing. Nice grapefruit hop aroma backed up by a hint of malt. The taste is up front grapefruit hops that aren�t over the top but just about right for the style. There is a light malt sweetness hidden behind the moderate hop bitterness. The finish stays with the grapefruit type hop theme.
Black Forest Brau Keller Pale Ale;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Forest Brau Keller;Light amber color with a thin head. Seemingly fresher than the other menu beers, light bodied, but tasty. Hints of toasty malts and nice hoppiness at the end.

Royal Oak Oktoberfest;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Royal Oak Brewery;A light brown/orange color.

Royal Oak EuphoriAle Barley Wine;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Royal Oak Brewery;Draught. At 2006 Michigan Brewers� Guild Festival. Hazy bubbly orange with a small white head. Gentle aroma of slightly grassy hops, solid juicy malt, lightly woody, and surprisingly mild alcohol. Very juicy and fresh taste, somewhat sweet malt, citrus zest, a bit of cereal grain, with ever-increasing bitterness and alcohol in the quite bitter, mildly oaky finish - simple and very enjoyable. Decent body, enough astringency and bitterness to keep it moving toward a balanced, not overwhelming finish - solid bw.
Royal Oak EuphoriAle Barley Wine;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Royal Oak Brewery;Rerate MiBGF 07: My lasting rating was almost identical to last year except I gave the flavor one additional point. I did not pick up any rye character this year but more peppery. Michigan BGF 06, day 2: Apricot hued with a small but lasting head. The nose detects a dry-hopped 3C hop character, citric and spicy, earthy yeast, caramel and biscuity malt, a bit vinous. The taste is sweet and fruity with an undertone of rye bready. Moderate alcohol and sherry-like finish, very warming. The mouth feel is smooth and lush. A darn nice brew, very solid, worthy of another.
Royal Oak EuphoriAle Barley Wine;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Royal Oak Brewery;Last glass at the MI fest! Hazy copper pour. The head is immediately fading, though initially well-sized and off-white. Rather balanced very aromatic nose with plenty of toasted caramel malts coming out both smoky and chocolatey. Generous hop bill, earthy, floral, leafy and woody rather than citric. Good overall balance, staying mostly on the english side, but not vinous. Medium-full bodied, light carbonation. More fruits would be appreciated, but this is a sweet and pleasant dessert beer that doesn,t get cloying.
Moon River Scottish Style Country Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Scottish Ale;Moon River Brewing Company;MMMMM i like scottish ales. This one pours a kind of deep brown. has a nice malty smokey flavor. a nice brew to enjoy.
Moon River Scottish Style Country Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Scottish Ale;Moon River Brewing Company;i would say this is the one i drank, and not the 9.5 one. sweet malty and actually not bad. im not a big fan of the style, but this one definately worked it out. brown color and malty smell. pretty good
Moon River Scottish Style Country Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Scottish Ale;Moon River Brewing Company;Hazy brown with good lacing & little head. The aroma is fruity & malty with some light Band-Aid coming through. The flavor is sweet with lots of bitter hops also coming through but on different levels, not balanced. Too sweet. Finishes with alcohol and musk.
Moon River Scottish Style Country Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Scottish Ale;Moon River Brewing Company;This could easily pass of as a whiskey barrel aged brown ale, or even a smoked porter at times. This is a very weird cross style ale. Very rich and complex, full of character. Aroma is lightly smoky, and the taste is quite earthy and woody. Lightly sweet at times, with a great malt character. This one is worth the drive.
Park Tavern Fallfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Park Tavern Brewery;A pint on tap at the source. 6.4% ABV listed. Look: Clear amber body topped by a decent white head. Mild but typical Marzen aroma with a hint of caramel. More hops and higher complexity in the flavor. Moderate bitterness for style. Medium body with carbonation that's too prickly.
Park Tavern Fallfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Park Tavern Brewery;A step up from the other brews, and a lot closer to the style. Pours a deep amber with thin slightly off white head. Pretty decent nose of caramel and faint grassy hops, holds up on the palate, finishes pretty clean but a bit too sticky, but the best of their beers I tried.

Park Tavern Fallfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Park Tavern Brewery;This is a richly malty version of the style. There�s not a huge hoppiness, but it is balanced, but this is definitely a caramelly malt dominance here. It is easy drinking, but you actually know you�re having a beer and not a watery lager with just a little caramel malt tossed in. It�s almost a little sticky, but not cloying.
Park Tavern Fallfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Park Tavern Brewery;Had on tap at the brewpub in Atlanta. Pours a dark medium-dark orange with a very light, almost non-existent slightly off-white head. Aroma has some brief nutty notes, a touch of choocolate as well. Flavor is pleasant, some caramel in there for sweetness and is balanced out nicely with some ripening vegetable notes, faint chocolate in the back end. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, and it fades in the finish, turning a bit spicy and muttled.
Park Tavern Fallfest;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Park Tavern Brewery;A huge full flavor take on this style. Extremely nice malt characters. The pour is nicely dark brown, with an amberish hue in the light. Aroma is slightly fruity. A small head with some nice lacing. Try this one while it lasts.
Rogue John - A Harvest Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Nice imperial red. Good balance of what tasted like caramel or butterscotch with juniper berries.
Rogue John - A Harvest Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Reddish hughes w a nice thick small bubbled head well laced Some cardboard light fruit very very mild Good coat nice body Malty sweet light grains. Pretty good
Rogue John - A Harvest Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;i guess this is the correct beer? dwyerpg says it is. however i thought it was called john toe splitter something crazy. too many different names with these rogue guys. the beer i had poured deep brown with whirly cream colored head. nose of fleshy resiny hops and sugar. pushes dark fruit and sticky hops on the palate. nice and full bodied quite robust for this abv. seemed more alcoholic than the 6% i had. strong ale, imperial ipa, barley wine? unsure where this one should fall, but if it really is only 6% were talking ipa. imo. good drinkin. i think we may be rating the wrong beer here, but i cant find anything else that works.
Rogue John - A Harvest Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Well, this may be a case where I just hate Rogue for giving their beers so many differnet names. I had this on tap last week in Las Vegas at the Freakin Frog, and the owner said it was an anniversary beer from Rogue called John Locker�s Stock. This appears to be the anniversary John beer. But, like the last guy, I wouldn�t consider this an american strong ale. It mostly just tasted like a pretty darn good IPA. An eleven on the aroma scale.
Rogue John - A Harvest Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Good head with light carbonation. Reforms nicely upon swirling. Slightly sour aroma with corn and some butternut squash. Cloudy orange in color. Fizzy palate. Pretty dry and bitter. More corn with some cloves and other spices. Little bit of sweetness. Finish is bitter and sits a little sour in the stomach. Bitterness pucker the mouth but does not induce salivation. Decent but not sure that I would consider it an american strong ale.
Rogue John - A Harvest Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Nice floral and piney nose. Good up front bitterness with strong resin and oil mouthfeel. Odd bready malt notes with a touch of lemon cookie. clean and soft mouthfeel with a lingering finish. Lots of resins on the backend.
Rogue John - A Harvest Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Bottle: Cloudy orange-yellow body with a white head. Aroma is buttery hops, lemon, citrus, grass. Flavor is crisp, bitter hops, lemon, citrus, grapefruit - much more hops than malt. Finish is bitter hops.
Rogue John - A Harvest Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Pours cloudy amber. Aroma of wet flowery hops and some mild caramel and malty sweetness. Flavor is an interesting soft flowery hops and soft sweet malt.
Rogue John - A Harvest Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Time in the bottle has weakened the overall bitterness in this strong ale. The earthiness blends well with the hop citrus flavor. Caramel maltiness also present. Johnny has a crispy flavor to it.
Rogue John - A Harvest Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Light spiciness and caramel aroma, sweet malt apparent. Sweet like a light bock/heavy dort, hoppy like a pils with a nice balance of earthy-spiciness and just a bit of citrus. Nice.
Martinborough White Rock Wheat;Martinborough, New Zealand;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);Bottle bought from Island Bay New World. Appearance: Surprisingly, the beer pours a golden colour with a quickly dissipating head - not white as I was expecting. This is an old bottle and the yeast has packed down quite hard. After rousing there are large floc�s of yeast that quickly sink to the bottom of the glass. Aroma: Lot�s of stone fruit (apricot, peaches) and an undertone of sweet orange. The citrus could be more dominant. Spicy, but seems to be more characteristic of the yeast rather than huge coriander additions. Very pleasant but maybe too fruity and not enough in the unmalted wheat character. Flavour: Strong orange taste, with the mid to late palate balanced out by the other stone fruit characters and coriander spice. Very low bitterness (as you would expect). Palate: spritzy, medium mouth feel. Overall: This is not a bad beer but can be extremely variable. Basically, it�s the equivalent of the French rugby team - Lots of promise and a corker some days but woeful on others. It would be nice to see more NZ breweries doing Wit style beers and giving it a run for it�s money.
Martinborough White Rock Wheat;Martinborough, New Zealand;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);Cloudy, buttery straw colour. Soft peach & other stonefruits nose. Exploded on pouring with alot of sediment, head clings to the edge of the glass. Soft & fruity with some spice but the carbonation kills things towards the end.
Martinborough White Rock Wheat;Martinborough, New Zealand;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);Bottled. Clear pale golden with a huge head. Some sourness and fruityness. Citric and a bit spicy - way way too high carbonated.

Martinborough White Rock Wheat;Martinborough, New Zealand;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);Tasted 29/06/2005. 330ml at Neil Miller�s Cellar-vate tasting. bottle conditioned, as you�d expect. Billowing white head rises out of the glass above a classic pale wit appearance - cloudy, pale, watery yellow. Massively dominant limey aroma that�s almost like rose�s lime juice syrup. It�s quite pleasant but not quite right and it means I can�t get the spicey aroma that I used to remember in here. Firey carbonation tingles the tongue. I�m sure this used to be better. Maybe its just te batch?
Martinborough White Rock Wheat;Martinborough, New Zealand;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);Bottled: Golden coloured. Light unclear. Fluffy huge white head. Citrus, perfume, flower in the aroma. Light notes. Flavor of spice, yeast and fruit. Smooth mouthfeel. Is very dry and light watery in the end.
Spreewalder M�rzen;Schlepzig, Brandenburg, Germany;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Spreew�lder Privatbrauerei 1788;The M�rzen when tasted very young (about 2.5 weeks) was malty sweet and quite good despite a bit of green beer taste. It seemed a bit stronger than your typical M�rzen, which was definitely not a bad thing. It later on developed a bit of diacetyl, strangely enough, but it was still quite tasty, malty with a bit of hop bite in the finish.
Haacht Maltosa;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Haacht;16/VIII/17 - 33cl bottle from Willems (Grobbendonk) @ Taste and Waste session 1 (home) - BB: 16/VIII/17 (2017-1240) Clear reddish brown beer, small irregular beige head, unstable, falls down very quickly and then dissipates. Aroma: smells like cola, weird. Also grains, malts, lots of cow fodder, horse stable. MF: ok carbon, light body. Taste: very sugary sweet, lots and lots of caramel, maltose indeed, some ersatz chocolate, lactose. Aftertaste: more sugar, caramel, grains, very sweet. Meh. What did I even expect.
Haacht Maltosa;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Haacht;Tasted as very diest, a beer that has been discontinued for a long time. Mine was almost 20 y old, bear in mind it for sure is over it�s top ! anyway, no fresh sample to be tasted anymore. �Pours nearly black ( thats a surprise ) Smell is weak, taste is dark Sugar, very simplistic sweet, like a cola that has been open for way too long. Actually, that is a pretty acurate taste discription ! just add some oxidation and you�re there.
Haacht Maltosa;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Haacht;Tasted as Very Diest, a semi-industrial kind of brown table beer with yellowish light beige, creamy, stable head leaving pretty lacing on the edge of the glass, very dark burgundy colour, clear. Caramel and chocolate in the nose but not necessarily in the �malty way�, simple with the typical brown sugar and cola sweetness of the style, some iron. Mellow, slick, very sweet palate, chocolatey and sugary, candi syrup, some weak sourish graininess and a metallic echo, cloying sweet finish with no distinguishable hops. Very straightforward, but I had worse in this style - as well as a lot better.
Haacht Maltosa;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Haacht;Sample thx to benzai. Dark brown colour with ruby redness shining through, no head. Smells sweet and malty. Tastes sweet and malty, bit flat but perfect to fit a steak.

The flavor has sweetness and notes of malt, caramel, dark syrup and bread. It�s smooth, mellow and pleasant to drink because it�s not cloying.
Haacht Maltosa;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Haacht;Bottle 33cl. Clear medium to dark red brown color with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly diminishing, beige head.

Corner Pub Oktoberfest;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Had about a 7 oz glass of this at the Corner Pub a couple of weeks ago. Served with an off-white head that lasted and some lace. Color was a clear red amber. Aroma was malty, a bare hint of roastiness and no hop. Flavor was about the same. Body was ok but a little light in carbonation. Ok finish too. Not bad, nothing special.
Corner Pub Oktoberfest;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Thanks to skyview. Malty nose with caramel hints and some malty sweetness. More sweet malt in the body with a faint toasted character.
Corner Pub Oktoberfest;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;(growler, thanks Skyview) Light copper pour with a white head.

Corner Pub Oktoberfest;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Thanks to Skyview for sharing this growler. This beer was a huge suprise. Great sweet amlt and a light roastiness accompany a light floral hoppiness. Nice balanced sweetnees to accent the roasy character. A nice light floral hoppiness finishes this beer very nicely. Very suprising.
Corner Pub Oktoberfest;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Thanks Skyview. Copper color with a little foam, and the appearnace is probably the best quality. Cardboard aroma. Light malt in the flavor with some chalk. Low carbonation.
Corner Pub Oktoberfest;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Sampled on draught at the Corner Pub in Reedsburg, Wisconsin. Pours a clear light brownish amber brew with a creamy off-white head that slowly dissolves to a fine film and ring. Nice lacing on the dissolve. Aroma is more malty than hoppy. Scents picked up were caramel malt, roasted nuts and some flowery hops. Taste is medium bodied, very light carbonation with a sweet caramel malt flavor. Finish is slightly watery but could taste more of the malt character than any bitterness.
Corner Pub Oktoberfest;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Cloudy amber with a smaller off white head. Aroma of dry malt, corn and sorghum. Flavors of sweet malt, wheat and nuts. Reminds me a bit of the Wolnzacher without the body. Acidty and CO2 are a bit harsh on the tongue.
Corner Pub Pumpkin Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Hazy light golden color with a wispy white head. Aromas of earthy, pumpkins, cloves, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger. Spices not overpowering as some. Flavors of light ginger. I think this could be called a ginger ale. Dry and quenching/cleansing.
Corner Pub Cream Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;On tap at the Corner Pub. Unfiltered, dulled orange-tan. Thin non head, some oily residue. Creamy, this is a Cream Ale all the way. Vanilla cream tones, really does taste like Cream Soda, so as far as stylistically, this one nails it. Minimal hop character but a real thick vanilla cream corn thing going on. Old school.
Corner Pub Cream Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;[Tap] Pours a golden color with a slight haze and a small white head. Aroma of cereal grains and vanilla extract. The taste is of creamy vanilla, bread, grains and light hopping. Smooth and drinkable with a light body. High carbonation level. This one was pretty good.
Corner Pub Cream Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;"Had about a 7 oz glass of this a couple of weeks ago at the Corner Pub. It�d be my main reason for returning. Served with a small white head that dissipated and a little lace. Color was 18 k gold. Aroma was bread, grain, and malt and very little hop.

Corner Pub Cream Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;On draught at the brewpub in Reedsburg, Wisconsin. Pours a clear golden pale brew with a lot of carbonation bubbles and an average white head that leaves behind a good lacing. Aroma of white bread malt, some citrusy hops and a touch of vanilla. Taste is light to medium bodied, well carbonated with sweet bread dough flavor along with some apple, pear and citrus peel. Finish is slightly bitter at first and then a bready aftertaste, then clean cut finish. It seems that the new brewmaster has a better product than his predecessors.
Corner Pub Cream Ale;Reedsburg, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Corner Pub Brewery & Bakery;Hazy golden color with a lid of white bubbles. Light floral hops and pale malt aroma - very doughy. Flavors of vanilla and cream soda. Aromas were nice but the flavors are quite synthetic.
J.T. Whitneys Pumpkin Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;I�m a sucker for a good pumpkin ale, however i thought this could have used a bit more spice and more pumpkin flavor. Pours a semi-hazey orange colour with a small creamy, frothy white top. Aroma has soft notes of cinnamon and nutmeg as well as light pumpkin. Taste i found to be a little too thin, pleasent but not very full.
J.T. Whitneys Pumpkin Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On tap at brewpub. Poured a transparent golden brown with a very small head and virtually no retention. Aroma of cinnamon and chocolate. Tasted of cinnamon and nutmeg, knid of pumpkin pie, maybe a little chocolate. Not a whole lot of hop or malt character to speak of, this beer derives most of it�s taste from the spices.
J.T. Whitneys Pumpkin Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;A really excellent pumpkin spiced ale. A complex mixture of flavors comes together in the mouth for a few minutes before fading. Looking forward to another release of this next year.
J.T. Whitneys Pumpkin Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Transparent orange-to-brown with a dusty and thin white head. Blessed be aroma. Rich pumpkin pie, nutmeg, cinnamon and pecan pralines doused in liquefied brown sugar. Flavor keeps the pace for the most part. Pumpkin at the front, spice in between and a finish akin to an experimental pumpkin flavored sandwich bread. Nice spiced subtly of pepper and nutmeg, and perhaps a toffee current for good measure. This is precisely the style of pumpkin ale that I�m a sucker for.
J.T. Whitneys Pumpkin Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Amber color with a thin head. Dry and grainy aroma, if an aroma can be dry... It definitely has the Grape Nuts taste going on. The pumpkin is present to be sure, but not as noticeable as I would want from an actual pumpkin ale. Decent, but not a good pumpkin.
J.T. Whitneys Pumpkin Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Deep golden color with a cream colored head. Pumpkin spice aroma. Spicy start with a malt middle and a dry pumpkin finish. Interestng swings in this swig.

J.T. Whitneys Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On draught at the brewpub in Madison, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-clear copper amber brew with a thin and fast dissolving off-white head that leaves behind a fine film and off-white ring. Aroma of semi-dry caramel malt, a touch of citrus zest, some circus peanuts, and earthy herbs. Taste is medium bodied, lightly carbonated with flavors of toasted caramel malt, light citrus zest and earthy herbs. Finish is semi-dry with a caramel and mild bitter aftertaste. Nice alt compared to some of the ones I�ve tried in Dusseldorf.
J.T. Whitneys Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Copper with a thin off-white head.

J.T. Whitneys Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Translucent and magnifying buffed copper-bronze in color with a mystical, atmospheric white cloud swirl for the head. Clean, minimal aroma gets us some earthy noble hops, recently cleaned milkhouses, acidic wafers, and bitter toffee. There�s even a signature green bottle skunkiness to it, leading with great trepidation into the flavor. Butterscotch sets in with a nutty praline connotation. Toffee bark and peanut brittle duke it out and somehow come out with a circus peanut composite. Earthy, moldy, authoritative hop display. Barky cardboard ransacked with rain water and caramel ribbons. It�s fairly authentic when it comes to style. Brown paper bags, mildly toasted by candlelight, and fading praline bark give a dynamic aftertaste, however hollow the middle was before it.
J.T. Whitneys Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Amber Coloring. Watery. Some Hops. Dry. Decent Overall, But Not a Whole Lot Going on in This Brew.
J.T. Whitneys Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Light amber color with no head. Kind of a dry wood aroma. Another dried item in the flavor, this time barley. Heavily carbonated which caused it to be kind of harsh on the tongue. Eh, didn�t do much for me.
J.T. Whitneys Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Amber color with a small bubbled cream colored head. Dry dark caramel aroma. Dry malt start leading to sweet caramel and toffee flavors. Nice malty brew. Finishes with a dry floral hops bitterness. A solid alt.
J.T. Whitneys Dark Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On tap. Pour is brown/black with light tan head. Sweet and malty with some roastiness and chocolate. Shares similarities with porter and dark bock.
J.T. Whitneys Dark Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Pours a slightly muddy brown, topped by half an inch of light tan foam. Decent head retention, moderate lacing. Mild sweet chocolate in the aroma � but more like a brown ale than an altbier. More of that sweet chocolate in the flavor, and a touch of raisin. Both of these flavors start strong enough, but finish on the meek side. Low hop presence, not a lot of character added. Just shy of medium bodied, carbonation also on the mild side.
J.T. Whitneys Dark Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Nice color and aroma. Strong taste with hoppy goodnes that makes the mouh happy.

McKenzie Old Salty Dog;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;McKenzie Brew House;GABF '03. Amber color with anoth thin white head (is this a trademark for this brewery?). I will say the alcohol was masked very nicely, although through too much malt and not near enough hops.
McKenzie Old Salty Dog;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;McKenzie Brew House;Poured a reddish amber color with a creamy white head. Slight aroma of cranberries, barely noticeable. Taste was unbalanced, very malty and alcoholic, with alittle bit of sweetness. I would choose another next time.

Stonehenge Bodyline;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stonehenge Ales;"Cask at the Station Hotel, Andover. An odd choice of name for this time of year! A deep chestnut pour with a thin beige head that left lots of lacing on the glass; toffee aroma; a rather thin body, but with a rich earthy taste, and some nutty malts; then a long deeply bitter finish. Needs more body, but otherwise pretty good."

Nevermind: this was brown, clear, no head, but with a promising brightness which signposted the tip-top condition this was in at the Olde George Inn, Christchurch; smooth, malty, fruity, bitter, a little biscuity; this description perhaps undersells it - the beer just hung together really well as a whole - surprising good beer."
Stonehenge Bodyline;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stonehenge Ales;Cask Handpump at the Smithfield Hotel, Manchester 19/06/2001 Light on the palate with some malt flavour in the finish.

Stonehenge Bodyline;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stonehenge Ales;Cask Conditioned at The Red Lion, Histon, Cambs. This is a pale gold beer with wooly head. Brewed to commemorate a great English sporting victory over our Aussie cousins on the cricket field (if only now !?) it is a hoppy, floral beer with a certain bitter directness on the palate, a bit like the bowling itself. A short thudding delivery, but overall a winner.Come back Harold Larwood, we need you now.

Spectrum Black Buffle;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Stout;Spectrum;Tasted this at the Paisley Beer Festival in May 2008. Cask, gravity dispense. Dull black in colour with a thin tan head. Good prickle of roast grain and instant coffee granules in the long intense aroma. Thin oily mouthfeel and poor lacing. Dark malts give a wide range of flavours with roast coffee, dark bitter chocolate and overipe bramble fruit lending a porter style flavour to this moreish stout. Very slight dusty note of hop resins appear briefly in the dry bitter aftertaste. Finish is malty and dry with liquorice and rich coffee bean flavours coming through in the mouth. A well crafted session stout and well recommended.

I seem to have been following this through several festivals, but have never got around to sampling it. Near black with a small off white head.

Spreewalder Zwickel;Schlepzig, Brandenburg, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Spreew�lder Privatbrauerei 1788;Draught at the brewpub. It�s murky, warm golden with a creamy head. The aroma has notes of malt, or rather actually more newly harvested grain, a little caramel and yeast. The flavour has a light sweetness and notes of malt, newly harvested grain, light caramel and it ends on a slightly dry, citrussy note. The balance is quite nice.
Spreewalder Zwickel;Schlepzig, Brandenburg, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Spreew�lder Privatbrauerei 1788;Draught at the brewpub. Weak yeasty aroma. Very cloudy yellow colour. Stable white head. The flavour starts off quite weak and watery, but turns fruity with a yeasty and slightly spicy aftertaste. Cleansing and slightly rough bitter finish.
Spreewalder Zwickel;Schlepzig, Brandenburg, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Spreew�lder Privatbrauerei 1788;The Zwickel is definitely this breweries best beer that is made on a regular basis. A bit of hop flavor comes through that I have not been able to detect as much in their other beers. There is not nearly as much diacetyl as the other beers, which really helps the overall flavor. The diacetyl in fact is barely perceptible (I may even be imagining that I can taste it). This beer has a slight haze to it and to my mouth is quite a bit rounder tasting than the corresponding pils.

Tsingtao 3.5%;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);For me the only drinkable beer in China. However that does not make it any better... it�s just average.
Tsingtao 3.5%;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Bottle @ Tony�s Mongolian restaurant china town Washington dc. Pilsner like appearance. Watery with faint bitter finish. Probably made of rice carbonates with no flavour additions. Maybe one hop flower to spice it up.
Tsingtao 3.5%;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Very light and greenish, looks like white wine. No carbonation, fizzy with a terribly weak head. Looks like a softdrink. Citric lemon smell with some very subtle spices. Citric sweetish fizzy taste. Flat and watery. A terrible beer but since there�s not much else in China it gets better over time.
Tsingtao 3.5%;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Bottle @ Countryard Marriot hotel, Kunshan. Pours pale golden with a small white head. Aroma of malt, sweet corn. Taste is malt, sweet corn, light grain, no bitterness. Thin body, lively carbonation. Sweet, but quite refreshing and not to bad. 030112

Bug Ocean Altbier;Perth, Western Australia, Australia;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Ocean Beach Brewing Company;It�s great when you find some of the old nots lying round. This was tasted at NFOB04 in Brisbane. Winkle and I were wandering arround a fair bit toether trying the odd beer. This is a well presented ber with good head and malty aroma. Fine caramello swetness and some good hoppy presence. I wanted to give this another go and had it again in the pavilion. Once again a good interpretation of an alt.
Bug Ocean Altbier;Perth, Western Australia, Australia;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Ocean Beach Brewing Company;NFOB 04, Darkish amber, nice smooth creamy head. The aroma is very malty, grainy bready caramel, also some nice hoppiness detected. Nice toasty maltyness, some fruit and a herbacious hoppy bitterness.
Bug Ocean Altbier;Perth, Western Australia, Australia;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Ocean Beach Brewing Company;NFOB 2004. Well the hefe was crap but this sure isn�t. I�m not well versed on alts but this one was very nice. Looked great, amber colour even left some lacing on a plastic cup. Caramel malt flavour with a medium body and creamy mouthfeel. Light bitter finish.
Bug Ocean Altbier;Perth, Western Australia, Australia;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Ocean Beach Brewing Company;Copper colouring with a small sized head. Fruity, floral aroma. Malty, chocolatey, fruity-sweet taste.
Bug Ocean Altbier;Perth, Western Australia, Australia;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Ocean Beach Brewing Company;Some museli slice. Pineapple and Kiwi fruit tastes. Some under emphasised german hops? OK.
Bug Ocean Altbier;Perth, Western Australia, Australia;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Ocean Beach Brewing Company;Haven't had to many REAL altbiers, so i'm not the best judge, but it seemed pretty true to style for me. Floral hops in the aroma, some caramel, and a nicely hoppy flavour, dry finish, pretty tasty, if not over the top.
Bug Ocean Altbier;Perth, Western Australia, Australia;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Ocean Beach Brewing Company;nfob03. this was the beer i was most looking forward to trying at the national festival of beers. it was decent enough, they certainly seemed to be trying hard to be authentic but that's not easy. good copper colour, floral aroma, hint of chocolate in the start and a finish of toothpaste for some reason. it was my last beer of the night so i guess it saved brushing
Bug Ocean Altbier;Perth, Western Australia, Australia;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Ocean Beach Brewing Company;Tried this beer back in august at Clancys fishpub in Subi. It had a copper brown colour with a small head and fairly good lacing. Quite light in body, initial taste of smooth malt finishing with a slight bitterness(Saaz hops?). Cheers!
Hunter Gatherer ESB;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;Copper color with tan foam. Slightly sweet malt flavor balanced by a moderate hop bitterness. Okay for the style.
Hunter Gatherer ESB;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;Draft at the brewery The ESB poured a dark amber with a small white head. No lacing. The aroma of caramel malts with some mild floral hops. The beer has a medium body and soft carbonation. Medium bodied, low carbonation, slight lingering bitterness. There was a hop bitterness but not pleasant.

Pours a hazy amber color with a thin white head. Fair head retention. Aroma of nutty notes, caramel malt, dry stone fruit, mild floral hops. The taste is caramel malts, nuts, herbal hops. Medium bodied, low carbonation, slight lingering bitterness.
Hunter Gatherer ESB;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;I don't have as much experience with ESBs, but this strikes me as a good, but not great, example. On draft at the brew-pub, pours a very appealing bronzed red brown color, good lacing. Aroma is a little faint but does reveal the English hop notes standard for the style. Taste likewise featured a subtle distinctive bitter hoppiness, although I was disappointed with the mild flavor intensity. Still a good drinkable brew, not excessively bitter. Finishes with something of a caramel aftertaste. Probably would sample this again. ---Rated via Beer Buddy
Hunter Gatherer ESB;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;Hoppy but not too much...smooth and flavorful...bitter as it should be...malty on front end

Hunter Gatherer India Pale Ale;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;Nice medium orange pour that is slightly murky, white head that laces nicely. Flavor is bitter but balanced and slightly earthy. Decently thick but pleasant mouth feel. I will agree with other posts, very drinkable.
Hunter Gatherer India Pale Ale;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;On tap at the brewpub. Nice medium orange pour - slighlty murky, sticky, bubbly white. head. Faint sprucey aroma with hints of mint. Flavor has the patented grapefruity bitterness one comes to expect from an IPA with some of the same house funkiness found in the Wheat - but it mixes in well here - adds some earthiness to it. Decently thick mouthfeel. Very drinkable.
Hunter Gatherer India Pale Ale;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;This is a good session beer. Drank it from the tap at the brewpub in Columbia, SC. Improved with warmth, and vastly superior to the PA, and nearly as good as the stout. Bitter, citrusy, and flavorful.
Hunter Gatherer India Pale Ale;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;Grainy, tea aroma with mild hops. Well-bittered and a little spicy.

Hunter Gatherer Wheat;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;From tap at Brewery. Pours a hazy golden orange color with no head.

Hunter Gatherer Wheat;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;Bit watered down, lacking a bit in flavor, bland like the rye old bastard they make...
Hunter Gatherer Wheat;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;On tap at the World Famous Hunter Gatherer Columbia, South Carolina. Unfiltered orange. Thin, fading off-white head. Odd orange tastes, grainy. Sour and certainly infected, this is a pretty crappy wheat. Clearly infected, so hard to defend. Off.
Hunter Gatherer Wheat;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;Draft at pub. Straw gold pour. Light wheat sent. Taste is not much wheat but very drinkable.
Hunter Gatherer Wheat;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;Probably the best, by style, of what was on tap at this brewpub. Hazy golden pour.

Hunter Gatherer Wheat;Columbia, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Hunter Gatherer Brewery & Alehouse;Draught at the brewpub. Golden colored American style wheat.

Aiken Thoroughbred Red;Aiken, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Aiken Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Red-brown body with a somewhat weak head. Light aroma with a bit more malt than hops. Flavor: earthy hops and roasted grains: not enough malts of style. Feel: Medium body with overly light carbonation. Overall: disappointing.
Aiken Thoroughbred Red;Aiken, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Aiken Brewing Company;Pours a clear amber brown on tap with thin ring of off-white head that leaves moderate lace. Aroma of diacytel again, buttery and malty. Taste is more toward the noble earthy hop and malty toastiness, again diacytel is covered. Meh, one of the better ones.

Aiken Thoroughbred Red;Aiken, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Aiken Brewing Company;[September 4, 2010] Pint at the brewpub. Looks pretty darn red without any head formation. This is malt leaning ale with flavors of caramel and biscuits, maybe just a grassy note here and there. Very inoffensive even for this style. I don�t have much to say about it.

Aiken Blonde;Aiken, South Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Aiken Brewing Company;Deep honey gold, almost brown-greenish. Subtle, floral aroma.

Aiken Oktoberfest;Aiken, South Carolina, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Aiken Brewing Company;Nice clean caramel malt. The main flaw is that the beer is a little too sweet. Dry it up a bit and it�s a winner.

Aiken Oktoberfest;Aiken, South Carolina, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Aiken Brewing Company;Mellow, buttery aroma with whiffs of cocoa. Light cider or undermatured notes to a cocoa-nutty lager. Cool bronze color, small layer of khaki foam. Quick finish with light sweetness. A good recipe, a little more work or maturation and it'd be stellar.
Texas Cattle Honey Nut Brown Ale;Macon, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;A nice dark brown pour with a sweet malt and light chocolate aroma. A toasted malt flavor with just a hint of alcohol at the end followed by a bitter that was an odd not all hop bitter. Just a slight bit watery with minimal carbonation which I like. This was the best beer of the bunch. They were out of the IPA and the stout.
Texas Cattle Honey Nut Brown Ale;Macon, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;Dark brown, hazy and no head. There�s a bit of dark malt, chocolate, a touch of coffee in the aroma. The aroma doesn�t smell off, so the tart finish is a bit of a shock. Kind of comes across like a passable attempt at a Oud Bruin or Flemish Brown, but I don�t think it was intentional. I plan on stopping back in a few months and try this again and see if it�s a consistent problem or a one-time deal. Between the wheats, the Red and this, the promise of that drinkable Lite just fell apart. How you can do a spot on light lager and flop with the more flavorful styles is beyond me. It�s not like you can hide anything in a light lager.
Texas Cattle Honey Nut Brown Ale;Macon, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;Rich, ebony color. Nice aroma. Not much of a head though. However, the smooth, roasted, nutty flavor make up for it. Very smooth and drinkable for a brown ale. This is the best of the lot @ Macon�s only brewery.
Texas Cattle Honey Nut Brown Ale;Macon, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;Dark copper appearance, slightly phenolic at first, but mellows out. No real discernible aroma. Has a bit of a chocolatey back end to it, slightly sweet. All in all, decent.
Texas Cattle Honey Nut Brown Ale;Macon, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;Buttery and slightly phenolic aroma. Walnut brown, no head. Fairly high bittering, split between malt and hops, dry with walnuts. Silky mouthfeel, zippy carbonation and light body. Long hop finish. Rerate This was better than I remembered. This go-round it was a fairly nice, mellow beer with hings of vanilla, coffee and cocoa. Cocoa aroma without any real sweetness. Medium body, lingering bittering.
Texas Cattle Red Lager;Macon, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;Diacetyl and phenolic aroma. Butter, char, medium bittering, light vinegar note. Scotch colored. Better cold. Adequate CO2. Medium-light body. Short, light hop finish.
Texas Cattle Pale Ale;Macon, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;Medium-light cascade and caramel aroma. Medium west coast hopping, some caramel, medium-lightly sweet, light acidity. Undercarbonated, thinnish with lightly tart finish.
Texas Cattle Stout;Macon, Georgia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;Stopped here on the home to Nashville. This is the only drinkable beer they had in my opinion. Lighting was dim, but the color appeared to be black, with an off white creamy head. Typical coffee lactose aroma. Flavor has a roasted tinge at first, but goes down sweet. Mild bitterness on the finish.
Texas Cattle Stout;Macon, Georgia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;On tap at Macon�s only brewery. Nice jet black color and foamy, khaki head. Smoky, charcoaly flavor was brief, but definitely there. No bite here, though - silky smooth, almost like a Gunniess. I would guess that alcohol content is quite low (< 5%). Overall, not a bad beer from a joint where the home brews run the gauntlent from decent to dispicable.
Texas Cattle Stout;Macon, Georgia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Texas Cattle Co. Brewery;Coffee and lactose aroma. Very interesting nutty and woody (No. 2 Pencil) flavor. Medium bittering, satisfying mouthfeel. Medium-long char-bitter finish. Sweet on the lips. Nothing wrong with this.

�dmans Indian Pale Ale;G�teborg, Sweden;IPA;Pannrummet K�k & Bar;I really hesitated before I started describing the color here. But I guess the differences come from different brewings... Color is hazy golden. Has a sweet aroma, maybe with some cherry (!) in it. A mild flavor and a rather mild finich. This one is more main stream than the other �dmans...

Fiddler Pale Ale;Den Haag, Netherlands;Pale Ale - English;De Haagsche Bierbrouwerij;CAsk at the brewpub. Rather thin and watery, there is both aroma and a hoppy finish in there, but I don�t feel it�s enough of it.
Fiddler Pale Ale;Den Haag, Netherlands;Pale Ale - English;De Haagsche Bierbrouwerij;Cask glass Consumed at De Fiddler, Den Haag, May 2006 Smells like semi-sweet clover honey. Has a small filmy head on a golden honey orange colored body. Sweet and light and malty up front, moderately bitter on the back... some honey and C hop notes, though fairly light. British IPA style I suppose, but nothing really to get excited about.

The aroma is herbal and hoppy. Grain and apple. Long hoppy, herbal, very bitter aroma. Moderately astringent mouthfeel. The hop content is balanced. I think it�s good when there is a food next to this beer: soup or pizza.

Lake Superior Seven Bridges Brown Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing Company;This one is ok at best. Too mild for my own personal tastes. However, it is pretty refreshing.
Lake Superior Seven Bridges Brown Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing Company;"12-oz. Pours a brown so dark it�s nearly opaque, but shows transparent when held up to the light. Loose, scattered grayish rim of bubbles. Biggish nose of toasted brown bread, roast caramel, and maybe a little tiny bit of campfire. Watery, light body. Mid-palate doesn�t show nearly the dimension that the nose does; there�s some brown toast and a little bit of caramelized sweetness, but not much, and not much at all to contrast with it. Nice, and refreshing enough, but hasn�t gone too far in search of a personality."
Lake Superior Seven Bridges Brown Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy of Beubie poured into a pint glass. Pours an iced-tea amber brown with a cream-colored head that stuck around as a solid ring for a while and left hints of lacing. The aroma is a mix of sweet caramel malts and a slightly toasted nutty smell, which, when mixed together, smell almost like iced tea. The taste is slightly sweeter than the aroma would suggest with the caramel malts dominating with hints of toffee. The nut aroma doesn�t carry to strongly into the taste and the finish has some earthy hop bitterness to it, though not much. The mouthfeel is fairly light with good carbonation and goes down very easy. This is definitely a drinkable brown ale and I could get through a few of these in a sitting easily. Simple but tasty.
Lake Superior Seven Bridges Brown Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Small off white head. Clear redish brown color. Very little aroma. Soft carbination. Good lacing. Kind of watery with a bit of coffee flavor in the end.
Lake Superior Seven Bridges Brown Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Redish brown color. Very little aroma. Extremely watery for a brown ale. Some very week malty nut flavor. Even the carbonation was lacking. Currently with 25 rating the average is 3.13 this is entirely too high. This is not a good brown. Try a Surly bender if you want a decent Minnesota brown ale it is much better.
Lake Superior Seven Bridges Brown Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing Company;I don�t understand the last reviewer. I poured this (albeit a little cold) and it had an INSANELY large head--as though I�d been shaking the bottle for several minutes. Anyway, the was a HUGE frothy head with a nice dark brown and cloudy color. Aroma was a faint but pleasant malt--nuts, fresh rain, and caramel. Mediocre flavor for a brown ale. Malty toasted nut flavor that was mild. The finish was shockingly dry--to the point I�d say it was bad. The beer was also rather bitter for a brown ale. As far as brown ales go, I don�t want to have to drink this again.
Lake Superior Seven Bridges Brown Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing Company;thanks to jason (Ughsmash) for sharing. Barely there aroma toated malts over a light brown pour w/ no head. Watery thin. Flavor almsot like a scotch ale, heavy grains some toasty malts, pretty avg at best.
Lake Superior Seven Bridges Brown Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Bottle via Jason. The beer pours to an amber body with a thin white head. The aroma is cookie laden toasted shortbread and light hops. The flavor is your typical toasted brown malts with only a slight nuttiness. The palate is moderately bodied with a light acetic quality. Nice texture with a slight dryness.
Lake Superior Seven Bridges Brown Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to Skyview! Poured a clear medium caramel with just a dusting of off-white head. Aroma picked up lots of artificial sweetness, working on a bit of nuttiness.. little bits of caramel and chocolate making an appearance. Flavor was on the lighter side with nutty notes and caramel represented.. floral and lemony accents to it.. not bad. Light-bodied and almost watery on the front half.. ok beyond that.
Lake Superior Seven Bridges Brown Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle from Blue Max in Burnsville, MN (June 2007, consumed a bit above fridge temperature from a Hair of the Dog glass. Pours quite clear dark amber, not quite brown really, with a smallish but persistent white head....nose is very, very faint -- dusky old dry nuts, light pale malts, a bit of wet cardboard....sadly, the body offers little more in the way of character, a touch of sweet malt, a bit of (again dry, and perhaps rancid) nut, slightly bitter and alkaline towards the finish, thin, watery....not much to go on here.

Gearys Winter Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;D.L. Gearys Brewing Co.;This is by far the best seasonal ale I�ve had this year. Hints of vanilla and spice with a strong bite that finishes clean and crisp. Love it!!! I�m in the Christmas spirit now !!!
Gearys Winter Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;D.L. Gearys Brewing Co.;12 Oz bottle. Pours clear, dark brown with a white head. Aromas of vanilla and anice. Flavor is the same, but then very quickly very bitter. Medium body with a thin mouthfeel and average carbonation. Overall, subpar seasonal ale, with not very good beer flavors.
Gearys Winter Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;D.L. Gearys Brewing Co.;Drought. Dark amber-brown with spongy beige head, caramrl aroma, slightly flat molasses taste, medium carbonation, medium unremarkable finish. Leaves a bit of a metallic taste on your palate.

Gearys Winter Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;D.L. Gearys Brewing Co.;A strangely flavored, surprisingly light beer. Dark colored, some raisin in the flavor, also some caramel, not much bitterness.
Gearys Winter Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;D.L. Gearys Brewing Co.;It poured a nice one inch light colored head on top of a hazeless copper colored body. The smell has some malts, light winter spices such as nutmeg, allspice and clove and has some really subtle light chocolates tones underneath. The hops are mostly non-existent in the smell. The taste is sweet between the previously mentioned flavors with the hops coming out very slightly to balance it a bit. The palate is smooth and clean with a light to medium sort of feel. It has a crisp bittter finish. Overall, this is an interesting take on an English IPA, but I like it for the most part.
Gearys Winter Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;D.L. Gearys Brewing Co.;Bottle. Not one of Geary�s finest brews. When you have HSA as a winter stalwart why did you go and brew this?
Gearys Winter Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;IPA;D.L. Gearys Brewing Co.;Bottle. Pours a deep ruby color with a thin tan head. Molasses aroma with that taste coming through as well. A bit of raisin flavor too. The hops do not come through until late which is odd as this is listed as an IPA. Its a bit heavy and syrupy but I do like it as well as most other Geary�s offerings.
Sparhawk Golden Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Casco Bay Brewing;Bottle. Slightly hazy gold/light amber color with a frothy, moderately lasting white head. Lots of big bubbles throughout after the pour. Kind of a sweatsock/ basement musty aroma with some slight citrus hoppiness in the background. Flavor like an over-lemony American Wheat...No real character, just kind of doughy and too sour. Could be improved with salty pretzels, but mostly just Blehhh.
Sparhawk Golden Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Casco Bay Brewing;A darker golden colouring with some bitterness and sourness. The finish is somewhat hoppy but the flavor is rather watery behind the initial hops.
Sparhawk Golden Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Casco Bay Brewing;This rather simple-looking bottle from the South Portland Hannaford. Golden amber body that is almost clear but slightly murky with head that is initially about an inch, but fizzles down to about a quart inch but leaves pretty good lacing. Smells sweet and hoppy, but a little off somehow, though I�m not sure how. Tastes much hoppier than the scent or style would suggest. The overall taste I can only liken to Kennebec Gurglin Sturgeon Stout, which is sometimes good, but has a burnt weird bitter metallic flavor to it sometimes. Not sure I�d buy this one again, not my kind of thing.
Sparhawk Golden Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Casco Bay Brewing;Bottle - Poured a hazy golden yellow in color with a thin white head that faded quickly. Aroma is slightly hoppy... not strong or distinct. Flavor is hard to describe and not particularly pleasant. Some hoppiness, but also a fair amount of sourness. Watery palate. Finish is slightly bitter. Not very good and not worth repeating.
Sparhawk Golden Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Casco Bay Brewing;(Bottle, best before 3/22/06) Pours a clear golden with a white head. Aroma a little soapy. A little bit of lacing. Mouthfeel OK, but actually watery. Taste: hard to describe, something weird - marshy, perhaps? like rotting organic matter. Probably not particularly appealing for a beer. Some bitterness too, particularly in finish. This one needs some work.
Sparhawk Golden Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Casco Bay Brewing;Draft. Light gold color with a small head. Aroma just reeks of adjuncts and grains. Taste is watered down orange and apple juice with some cereal thrown in. In fact, you could say it�s a light liquid breakfast but that would make youthink there was some real flavor in this. I guess this is a new company contract brewing. I really hope they revise the recipe.
Sparhawk Golden Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Casco Bay Brewing;For a golden I was quite happy with this beer. It�s a very refreshing clear fizzy beer that backs a decent amount of malt and hop flavors. Finish is very clean and doesn�t linger around too long. Great summertime beer.
Sparhawk Golden Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Casco Bay Brewing;Golden color with nice head. Gentle citrus hop aroma. Tasting is a quick and light hop hit with medium bitterness, but all over too quickly. Not bad, but nothing too exciting here.
Sparhawk Golden Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Casco Bay Brewing;12 oz bottle. Clear gold, smallish lasting white head...faint, light malts and sweet lemon in the aroma...body is metallic-tinged Sprite, with little malt and only a faint touch of dry hops...quite drinkable but that�s about it. Good for a hot day after you�re too drunk to taste much.
Sparhawk Golden Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Casco Bay Brewing;"can we rename this ""dirty penny ale""? i�m on my third, hoping the tinny taste would dull once my sences dulled but alas, it still tastes like i�m sucking on a roll of lincolns."

Bent River Oatmeal Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bent River Brewing Company;On tap, poured into a shaker. Oatmeal chocolate chip and raisin cookies are what this beer smells like. It has the appearance of a watery, dark brown-black liquid. It doesn�t leave any lace and retains a light ring of head. The beer is a combination of medium / medium-high sweetness with a light bitterness. The beer has a watery texture without too much carbonation - it�s kinda flat, but does had a very light, soft carbonation. The medium, malty body finishes with a sweet chocolate and raisin crescendo, and a touch of cola. The aftertaste is short lived, but has a fresh baked cookie quality.

Casco Bay Carrabassett Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Casco Bay Brewing;12oz bottle poured into Chimay goblet. Appearance is golden color with very small head that dissipates quickly. Smells of malt and mustiness. Taste is of some strange herbs and citrus. There is something in the taste of this beer I just don�t like. It�s drinkable but I will avoid it in the future.
Casco Bay Carrabassett Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Casco Bay Brewing;Not a bad summer ale. Very light, with some lemon to make it more refreshing. Its a lawnmower beer, but well made. Dry and not sweet at all. Slightly bitter, with lots of mineral salts.

A hazy body with heavy lace that last all beer long. Smell is very light but creamy. Taaste is lightly malty. Very creamy with a light hoppy aftertaste. I don�t know if this is supposed to be a cream ale but it sure as hell tastes like one. Medium bodied and uncomplicated. Not a great beer but it harkens back to the days I was weaning myself off of Coors Light with Genessee Cream Ale and Genessee 12 Horse at the Nyabinghi Dance Hall back in Morgantown, WV during my brief and academically unproductive college career.
Casco Bay Carrabassett Summer Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Casco Bay Brewing;Comes in a 12 oz long neck..simple label..yellow with one of those Olde Fashioned compass point doohickeys. OK first off I think I got a bad botle of this beer..as I poured it very carefully it produced a monsterous head..in fact 80% of the pint mug was filled with head..the beer I can actually see is pleasant enough hazy gold. The aroma is still pretty good very wheaty..pleasant sourness, The taste however is overwhelmed by the CO2..some wheat I can make out. Mouthfeel is pure carbonation. Not drinkable ..I think this must be a bad bottle
Anchor Our Special Ale (2003);San Francisco, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Shared 12 oz. bottle, poured to snifters showing a deep mahogany hue, with some tan head foam that diminished immediately to bubbly film and a thin ring, with only some leggy spots decorating the glass. The nose was a hint of teriyaki, and dark fruit. Light to medium bodied, with no effervescence, the taste was dry, with a hint of soy, and a fairly indistinguishable, washed out flavor. Didn�t cellar well.

Anchor Our Special Ale (2003);San Francisco, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Very dark brown beer. Lots of brine sugar and some spices mix fairly well with the oxidation. Better than I would�ve though!
Anchor Our Special Ale (2003);San Francisco, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Bottle... Poured near black with a small head, mild lacing and retention. A bit of oxidation in the aroma which was soon masked by earthy, herbal, and baking-like spices. Similar in flavor but missing depth and sweetness to pull it through. A hint if soy sauce with brown sugar too. Along the lines of other vintage Anchor Christmas Ales I have had, but I have had some from the late 90s that were even better than this one.

Anchor Our Special Ale (2003);San Francisco, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Bottle shared with Craig Christmas 2011. Pours a black color with a large brown head. The aroma is a odd sour and spicy nose, some oxidation. A sweet spicy flavor with some metallic sourness and bitter prune. Almost like unripe fruit and also overripe fruit! Bitter pine. Not my thing, interestingly this is very much like the 1989 I had heading that way for sure. Both has sourness and metallic flavors that were not pleasant. Drinkable, but odd.
Anchor Our Special Ale (2003);San Francisco, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Maybe a bit too long to cellar, this beer still offered a wonderful bouquet of yuletide flavors that left me grateful to try the beer and mucho thanks to my xmas party host. Poured from a bottle with a small off-white head and midnight-burnt sienna body, the flavor was on-point for an 8 year old brew. Nicely developed caramel and ginger notes mixed well with the noticeable spruce hints to create what I consider a full bodied beer (rare given the style). If you are lucky enough to try this beer, don�t complain if it isn�t what you expected. Just be gracious for the offering, remember the season, and enough what is a delightful winter/Christmas beer.
Anchor Our Special Ale (2003);San Francisco, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Pour out of bottle is dark reddish with thin white head, aroma has notes of caramel, pine, mint and spruce notes, touch of hints of spice in there with a touch of faint molasses. Taste is a really strong minty and pine, spruce tip presence, touch of molasses and slight dark fruit, finishing fairly clean and sweet. A bit weird but ok.

A pale gold colour with a saopy looking white head; light biscuity malt aroma; soft and soapy in the mouth with a good balance of biscuity malts and grassy hops; then a sticky, moreish finish.

Pours dark brown with white frothy head.

Tower Bursley Bitter;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tower Brewery;Dark bitter with a frothy head and a bitter, dry and toffee aroma. Watery and toffee flavoured generally. Overall a general watery bitter with hints of dryness.

Aromas are melon and kiwi with roast malts, light chocolate and cream. Flavours are creamy, sweet chocolate with peppery grapefruit hops. Light but may with a peppery, spiced oranges finish. Decent.
Hoskins Brothers Little Matty;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Stout;Tower Brewery;Cask conditioned - handpump - Ale Wagon Leicester. A pitch black beer with a short-lived small beige coloured head. Very mellow for a stout, verging on a mild. There are some lightly roasted elements in both the aroma and the taste together with some fruitiness. Slightly apply in parts, but otherwise a decent drop.
Hoskins Brothers Little Matty;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Stout;Tower Brewery;Stoutish appearance with a red to orange head!!! which stains when spilt. Vanilla/sour cream aroma, with a hopped and slightly toffee like flavour which is thick on the palate. Overall an unusual beer that you would not want to spill on anything valuable.
Lompoc Hedge House Harvest Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lompoc Brewing;"Draft: It was dark, so I couldn't really see the color well, but it looked dark amber. Mild, soft carbonation. Very sweet malts; soft and sugary. Brown sugar flavors throughout. Mild bitterness came up in the rear. Didn't really notice any obvious rye notes. Not very complex, but decent tasting."
Gold Coast Queensland Black Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Stout;Gold Coast Brewery;Black, little carbonation or head. THe only one of the brews at this place worth drinking. Some roast and choc aroma and flavour. more of a stout than an ale. Good body.

Gold Coast Queensland Black Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Stout;Gold Coast Brewery;Thank god this was at least OK, given the general crappy nature of the beers this brewer produces. Some roastyness happening. Some brown sugar aswell. Really thin mouthfeel, short flavour, but, i wasn't expectiing much.
Gold Coast Queensland Black Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Stout;Gold Coast Brewery;nfob03. the first beer i tasted at the national festival of beers. quite a mild stout, pleasantly black. minimal sweetness, faint asphalt in the aroma. doesn't really go anywhere or do anything interesting
St Peters Brewery Belgian Wit;Sydney, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;St Peters Brewery (Australia);tasted at the nags head, 7/11/03. like a reinheitsgebot belgian wit. looks right - pale yellow, but had no real trace of coriander or curacao. actually could have done with a slice of lemon (i know it's embarrassing to say that) to bring out the distant citric tang
Yeti Special Export Lager;Malli Bazar, Sikkim South, Sikkim, India;Pilsener - Imperial;Yuksom Breweries;22oz bottle - First, I have to admit that I did not drink this entire thing. It just didn�t keep me interested enough to consume the whole bottle. But what I did have, wasn�t horrible but reminded me of a pretty typical Euro strong lager. Very grainy, corny sweetness, smooth mouthfeel with no complexity and a clean finish...when cold. I imagine it�s pretty gnarly when warmed up, so why wait for something bad to happen when you know it�s going to happen? The one thing that was pretty bad about this beer...when I poured it into my glass....there was no head. Zero. Zip. Nada. There was carbonation on the palate, but in my glass? Looked like apple juice. Very weird.
Yeti Special Export Lager;Malli Bazar, Sikkim South, Sikkim, India;Pilsener - Imperial;Yuksom Breweries;A: The beer pours a clear golden orange color with a short lived white head. S: Definitely get some butter up front with a bit of grass, straw, and metal. Light malt character with plenty of corn and a bit of table sugar. Maybe a touch of honey and overcooked grain. T: Tastes very much like candy corn. Very sweet and sugary, a strong corn flavor as well and a slight buttery creaminess. Hints of straw and grass as well, with almost no bitterness. M: Light to medium in body with a medium level of carbonation. O: Really a weird flavor. Certainly not all that good, but the candy corn flavor was sort of interesting.
Robinson Black Cherry;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Draught. At Smokeless Joe. This isn�t beer, it�s *medicine* Cloyingly sweet but tart too - cough syrup is EXACTLY what it smells and tastes like. Okay reddish pour, but just look at it, don�t drink. I heard the brewery went under recently - my theory is they�re being punished for inflicting this beer on me. Or not.
Robinson Black Cherry;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Robinson Brewing (Canada);On tap at Cest what with Dougshoemaker and JadoreBlanche. Appears to have a copper red body, with a creamy white head. Aroma is black cherries, suugary, like cough syrup. Taste is sweet and sour cherries, like robitussin. Watery, fizzy.
Robinson Black Cherry;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Robinson Brewing (Canada);On tap and Ces�t What in Toronto, in the company of Doug Shoemaker and Mr.manning!

Watery and smooth, maly flavours linger. Good!.
Robinson Black Cherry;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Robinson Brewing (Canada);I actually thought this showed nice complexity. Pale amber colour with a pink tint and a large pinkish-hued head. Black cherry sweetness and aroma, light spice and a hint of almond. Flavour was fairly sweet, but not cloying with a long cherry finish.
Robinson Black Cherry;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Robinson Brewing (Canada);On tap, C�est What. I quite liked this beer. Red body (of course!), lovely cherry aroma. Mouthfeel is smooth, although a bit thin - silky. Taste is all cherry, but I found a good malt balance to it - this exceeded any of the fruit beers I tried in the recent LCBO summer release. Very little aftertaste. Overall, while I don�t love fruit beers, nor do I dislike them, I really enjoyed this pint. A nice surprise.
Robinson Black Cherry;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Well, it looked pretty good with a beautiful cherry colour but it was all downhill from there. Aroma is dominated by cherries, so is the flavour. Steve got it right when he said it was all Cherry Halls. Very sweet and the 4oz sample that I had was almost to much for me.
Robinson Black Cherry;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Well I might have been feeling a little cold coming on....but then a dose of Cherry Halls cured what ailed me. Admittedly this was a crisp somewhat refreshing beer with a bit of a bitter finish, but I couldn't get past the medicinal cherry aromas and flavours.
Robinson Black Cherry;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Clear red amber pour with a thin sudsy creamy off white head. Light sweet fruity aroma with herbal perfumey qualities. The tastes are nice although a little watery. Cherry tartness, hop bitter. Mint or thyme. Burnt cedar.

Manhattan Beach Pumpkin Ale;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Manhattan Beach Brewing;I remember this as Great Pumpkin ale back when it was first brewed in the early 90s. If I remebr correct MBBC opened in 1991 or so. Tap at MBBC. pours a rich copper color with nice white head. Aroma of pumpkin cinnamon and spice. Taste is malty sweetness pumpkin cinnamon spice. Finish is pumpkin and spice. I remeber waiting for this special brew every October. I need to re visit the MBBC again.

Red Car South Bay IPA;Torrance, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Red Car Brewery & Restaurant;"First of all, I shall assume this beer also goes by the name, ""Red Car IPA"", which it was listed as on 6/30/09 at the brewpub. Served in the same chilled and ungainly goblet as the porter. I actually let this brew sit for 5-10 minutes before touching it, fearing my lips might get frozen to the rim of the glass. Appears hazy orange with a medium sized head. Aroma is faint for an IPA, but from what I could detect, it had nice juicy apricot, grapefruit and peach fruit. Flavor was rounded, fruity, but a little muted. Frustratingly, I couldn�t really tell if this was the fault of an overchilled glass (detracting ability to taste flavors) or just the beer itself. From what I could tell, this is a decent, strong, IPA with a full body."
Red Car South Bay IPA;Torrance, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Red Car Brewery & Restaurant;My favorite Red Car brew, some nice grapefruit, Piney hops, but not overdone, plenty of malt character as well, easy drinking considering the Alc.%, didn�t know it until now, very nice drinker! on Tap at brewery.

Small off white head around top of glass. Aroma has a little pine, spicy hoparoam with a little grapefruit in there. Not overpowering but a good hop aroma. Flavor is of pine hops, firmly bitterd, and a good malt profile that comes through. A little sweet, and some toasty flavors coming through on the finish. This beer is full bodied but very drinkable. Very balanced for an IPA. Not too over the top.
Red Car South Bay IPA;Torrance, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Red Car Brewery & Restaurant;Draught at the pub. 03/08. Copper amber foamy lacing off white head. Resinous dry fruity aroma, taste a bit off seems unbalanced with a front of dry malt and the hops are just dry astringently bitter. Drinkable, but blah.

Bonaventure Stout;Los Angeles, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Bonaventure Brewing Company;On draft at brewery, 11/19/07. VERY dark brown pour with ruby notes if held to strong light. Nice head retention, outlasting the other beers on my sampler tray. Served on nitro, as creaminess of texture reveals. Aroma is all coffee grounds. Mouthfeel, despite creaminess, is somewhat thin. Rich coffee flavor overwhelms almost everything else, though a hint of roasted malts peeked through mid-taste. Didn�t notice any hop character. One dimensional.
Bonaventure Stout;Los Angeles, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Bonaventure Brewing Company;Their manliest offering, its smoky, warm, nutty, and smooth. Its well done, but not an overwhelmingly good beer. I�m not a sucker for stouts, but I found this to be very drinkable.

Town Hall Daylight Robber;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;I'm just assuming this is meant to be in the vein of New Belgium's 1554, for the pub was far too busy at the time, to annoy the bartenders with questions. I had 2 pints during the dollar hour, then capped it off with a cask version. Appearance: deep, dark brown, just on the verge of black,like the color of our skies after 5pm, with a good, though brief, cocoa-tan head. Aroma: soft, creamy, earthy, and arousing, giving subtle associations of chocolate and roasted coffee beans. Taste: pleasantly slightly sweet greeting on the tongue, glimmers of fruit, herbs, though nothing specific, more of a spectral sensation . Plenty of grit on the palate, nice little hoppiness, an earthy, generous, and complex texture, that starts out rather nonchalant, than gives off more chocolately flavors, spices, a hint of fruit. Medium bodied, and extraordinarily consumable. On cask: after the cascade, the color eventually settles into a more solid black color, a milky, creamy head, and a lighter flavor, sensuous, playful texture, an absolute dream, the rival of any nitro-stout you want to put it up against.
Town Hall Daylight Robber;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Ruby red deepness with an overall thin oily blackish murk with amber highlights, thin but thickly built dark ivory head, lace in globby short strings. Aroma is lightly roasted malts with softer deep dark toffee and a sprinkle of old coffee. Taste is subtle and mild, very pleasing easy tones of roastyness upfront with underlaying coffeeness, hazelnut mellows in at the midway point and has a pleasant belgian yeast spicyness which flows right to the finish, ending crisp and dry with a nice touch of coffee and nuts which lingers for a good time. As it warms it picks up notes of plum fruityness and ginger bread dough just before the finish. Great subtle flavors that mix and build together nicely. Feel is a solid medium body with a pleasnt carbonation and a nice little finish of crispy dryness. A fine drinkin' beer and at only 4.5% makes for a excellent session brew. This goes to show you that not every beer needs to slap you in the face. There's something to be said about being able to appreciate mild beers and this is the beer in which to do it with. Nice work, liked this alot actually, more so then the numbers give way to.
Town Hall Daylight Robber;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;well, this smells like a dark belgian. nice thick tan head. starts with an annoying and sweet banana flavor that leads eventually to a bit of coffee and a bit of bitterness. medium to thin... a tad syrupy. the worst beer i've had at this brewpub.
Town Hall Daylight Robber;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Not much in the aroma, but I could pick up some malt. Great appearance. Black with a thick and creamy head that left a thick lace on the glass. Surprisingly light in flavor, with a taste similar to Guinness. medium bodied. One of the few disappointments from an outstanding brewpub. The bartender said it was difficult to classify, but that it was closest to a schwarzbier. Interesting, he said it was made with a Belgian trappist yeast.

Rock Bottom Indianapolis Circle City Light;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rock Bottom Indianapolis;Draught at RB Indy/Downtown. Hazy yellow with no head. Nose is sweet, light yeast and faint fruit - not much here! Malty and soft, but lightly dirty before resolving to a Nottingham-like bready aftertaste. Medium body a little full for style. Nothing really too off here, but I can�t get over the dirt.
Rock Bottom Indianapolis Circle City Light;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rock Bottom Indianapolis;Sampler Draft at brewpub. A fine example of the style, showcases the best of what this style can bring. This beer is perfect for a long, hot day when you want a thirst quencher with high drinkability but prefer more taste and complexity than the macros. There is a hint of hops in the nose, with small white head. This beer doesn�t bring out many flavors, but it is well balanced and is fuller than comparable light beers. A good craft beer gateway for non craft/import drinkers.
Rock Bottom Indianapolis Circle City Light;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rock Bottom Indianapolis;Had on tap at the brewpub. Pretty much your average old light pale lager to tell you the truth.
Rock Bottom Indianapolis Circle City Light;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rock Bottom Indianapolis;From the Jug at the GABF, Colorado Convention Center 13/10/2007 Small white head. Some carbonation. Pale malt and hop aroma. Clear golden coloured and hoppy with a crisp and slightly dry malt finish.
Rock Bottom Indianapolis Circle City Light;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rock Bottom Indianapolis;draft at the downtown brewpub - Pours yellow with a one finger white head and a very light malt aroma. The flavor is also extremely light. It�s watery and while not bad tasting, that�s mostly because it hardly tastes like anything. I think there�s a touch of hops in the finish. This pointless beer has no reason to exist.
Rock Bottom Indianapolis Circle City Light;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Rock Bottom Indianapolis;A nice change from BMC, but not one I care too much about. Looks like a thicker, fuller Bud, and tastes about the same.
Waddenbier Spelt (Wattenbier Dinkel);Bolsward, Netherlands;Specialty Grain - Other;Friese Bierbrouwerij;Bottle. The smell is sweet and moderate malty, unfortunately it�s a rather strange kind of sweetness. The head is small, white and fizzy, it is fast and fully diminishing. The body is clear and yellow. A moderate sweet taste with a short duration. The body is light, dry and with a soft carbonation. Not my taste...
Waddenbier Spelt (Wattenbier Dinkel);Bolsward, Netherlands;Specialty Grain - Other;Friese Bierbrouwerij;Bottle on Schierminnekoog. Very wheaty, with very orange-coloured appearance. Very sour but pleasant nonetheless, especially being up in the Wadden.
Waddenbier Spelt (Wattenbier Dinkel);Bolsward, Netherlands;Specialty Grain - Other;Friese Bierbrouwerij;Bottle. I was given a little sample of this by the smartest dude at D�s Six Pack in Edgewood. He decided to crack a bottle and sample the bar... What a great guy! This is a nice wheaty, yeasty concoction that was tiny bubbled and very tasty. Light in body, but not in flavor, it had nice sour and spicy notes to it. Good stuff!
Waddenbier Spelt (Wattenbier Dinkel);Bolsward, Netherlands;Specialty Grain - Other;Friese Bierbrouwerij;Hazy orange colored with frothy white head. Aroma of hay and hops - fresh but anonymous. Quite citrusy and yeasty flavor with honey notes. Bitter dry finish.
Waddenbier Spelt (Wattenbier Dinkel);Bolsward, Netherlands;Specialty Grain - Other;Friese Bierbrouwerij;"An unclear amber beer with a white head. The aroma is simple; sweet and malty. The flavor is sweet with notes of caramel and honey. An OK beer."

Waddenbier Spelt (Wattenbier Dinkel);Bolsward, Netherlands;Specialty Grain - Other;Friese Bierbrouwerij;Orange color, cloudy. Hard to define the nose. Some orange, just a hint of vinegar sharpness and vanilla. Medium bodied. Yeasty, orange, a hnit of vegetables. Dusty. The aroma is better as the flavor in this mediocre beer.
Waddenbier Spelt (Wattenbier Dinkel);Bolsward, Netherlands;Specialty Grain - Other;Friese Bierbrouwerij;Bottle conditioned. Hazy amber, good white head and moderate condition.

McNeill's Pilsner;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McNeill's Brewery;Pours hazy golden yellow color with aroma of bread, yeast, and citrus. Bread flavor with some citrus, honey, and a touch of sour flavor. Nice beer.
McNeill's Pilsner;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McNeill's Brewery;Bomber - Poured a golden amber in color with no head and little or no carbonation. Aroma is of bready yeast with just a hint of fruity hops. Flavor is of fruity yeast... almost in a Belgian or Hefe kind of way. Not much hop bitterness. Nutty malt and slightly sour on the finish. Not a terribly distinctive beer, but easy drinking.
McNeill's Pilsner;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McNeill's Brewery;(22oz bottle) Purchased at Winooski Beverage in Vermont. Wow! Ray McNeill certainly doens�t want you to feel like you�ve been jipped - this is the second bottle in a row thats been filled to the cap FULL! Pours a medium, white frothy head with a partially clouded, amber body. Nose of tin, flat beer and bready. Very doughy taste with tones of flat ginger ale and citrus hops. When they say beer is liquid bread - this was the beer they�d referred to...
McNeill's Pilsner;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McNeill's Brewery;Bottle from City Market, consumed on 3/11/06. Hazy, golden-honey colored beer with plenty of white head that steadily fizzles to a small cover, providing little to no lacing, quite bubbly. The aroma smells yeasty, typical McNeills house character, with flowers, moss, hay and light honey grains all creating a soft and approachable nose. However, the more it warms, the more a sourdough-like note seems to creep in. Decidedly dry and bland, and working against the otherwise grassy, almost fruity hop crispness. The flavor is very yeasty, though it�s just a dry, nutty yeast, with plenty of flowery hops, some straw, hay, damp moss and bits of lime and lemon adding a silght poignancy. Very grainy, almost a gritty texture were it not for the vigorous carbonation at first. A slight toastiness is apparent, on the back of the throat as the beer finishes, with some sweet, round honey notes balancing this well. Not overly bitter, but enough so to be refreshing and complement the malt. After the carbonation dies off, somewhat, the texture becomes rather chewy and yet lightly slick on the end. No alcohol apparency.
McNeill's Pilsner;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McNeill's Brewery;Was it the herb cheese I just ate, or was it the smoked beer? This stuff had a strong clove/esther taste a la German Hefe Weizen style. It was somewhat flat, also. Too thin, and not crisp enough. Did I just get a bad bottle? Not impressive.
McNeill's Pilsner;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McNeill's Brewery;Hazy deep straw in color with a large white head. aroma of floral hops. Bitter flavor with a buttery character and a crisp malt flavor. A fresher version would more than likely kick ass.
McNeill's Pilsner;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McNeill's Brewery;Hazy blonde with a mlaty grassy aroma. Astringent hops with a peppery finish. Lightly acid and sour. Salty afternotes. Medium bodied.
McNeill's Pilsner;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McNeill's Brewery;22 oz. bottle: Light malts and dull flowers in the nose, hazy yellow with a thin white head, decent lacing. Starts and ends lightly bitter with a slight sourness at the end.
McNeill's Pilsner;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McNeill's Brewery;March 2004: It�s McNeill�s, I expect great things -- even from a lager. On the whole, not disappointed. Nice bright golden, large diminishing fine-foamy head, spicy-sour but fresh nose. Good, balanced flavor, tending toward the hop at the end, but a little on the weak side at the front. Firm maltiness, lemony middle. 6/4/7/3 /14 3.4 March 2006: 22 oz bottle purchased today, presumably quite fresh, at City Market, served just above fridge temperature in a Christoffel glass. Pale bubbly slightly oily burnished gold, moderate to large smooth head dies into a shy cap....honey and lovely floral-grassy notes in the aroma, bit of juniper and dogwood, perhaps some lemon zest.....smooth, solid but restrained bitterness throughout, very very clean which surprises me from this brewer these days, lightly sticky at the front but getting progressively drier, herbal-inflected and slightly mineralic towards the long, bitter finish. Really quite fine, perhaps just a touch too smooth and light but I�m not complaining. New rating.
McNeill's Pilsner;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;McNeill's Brewery;This pours an clear golden body with an irregular white head. Aroma is herbal, grassy, not quite topping the style and lacking a bit of hoppiness. The taste is better though, I'm tasting the sunny fields of Vermont, yum yum, they are grainy, spicy and remarkably crisp displaying a good long dry bitter finish.
Northampton Nonotuck IPA;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Northampton Brewery (MA);So usually when I taste an ipa, i try to notice either pine or citrus, then i sip it. Forgot about pallisades hops, This is a weed ipa. This one is fairly well made with a ramping bitterness in the finish
Northampton Nonotuck IPA;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Northampton Brewery (MA);Sampled at the pub, poured with no head, slightly resiny, hoppy with some bready malts but seems a little weak. Decent beer though.
Northampton Nonotuck IPA;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Northampton Brewery (MA);"My Bottom Line: Grapefruity and floral hops swing within the clean, sociable body of this well-brewed but generic and understated IPA. Further Personal Perceptions: -A slim veil of foam covers the hazy gold. -Carbonation is prickly and works fine with the lean mouthfeel. -The herbal, leafy hop bitterness is very polite. -The flavor profile is the continuation of the aroma; feathery, quenching, and unmemorable. On tap at the brewpub."
Northampton Nonotuck IPA;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Northampton Brewery (MA);On-tap at the brewpub. Rather pale colour, though lace and creamy. Orange grapefruit flavours, a tad metallic.
Northampton Nonotuck IPA;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Northampton Brewery (MA);Shared a sampler that had this in it. Standard yellow color. There was a large hop-filled flavor. I�m not crazy about hoppy stuff to begin with. Sorry.
Northampton Nonotuck IPA;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Northampton Brewery (MA);tap at the brewpub. Deep hazy copper thick off-white head. Aroma is lightly hoppy, grapefruity, pine and a touch of resinousness. Light crystal sweetness, bready flavour. Ligtly hoppy flavour. A bit of light appley fruit, grapefruit. Light resiny flavour. Decent IPA. Could use some more dry hops.
Northampton Nonotuck IPA;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Northampton Brewery (MA);"On tap at the brewpub. Clear copper color with a robust hoppy taste that isn�t overwhelming, yet still walks up and says ""hi."""
Northampton Nonotuck IPA;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Northampton Brewery (MA);Golden with a thin white head. Smells of grapefruit and hops. Taste is nicely balanced but not as hoppy as I would have liked.
Northampton Nonotuck IPA;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Northampton Brewery (MA);Draught: This beer is a hazy, dark golden color. There was no head on mine. There was still a slight bit of lacing down the glass. The aroma was mainly of grapefruity hops, with a hint of pine. The beer had a medium body and seemed well balanced. The hops were evident in the taste, but not overwhelming. (Maybe I�ve been drinking too many Imperial IPA�s lately!). A good beer.
Northampton Nonotuck IPA;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Northampton Brewery (MA);Solid IPA with a very nice hazy color to it. Good punch at about ~7 ABV, but it�s extremely hidden. Only on tap.
Northampton Piece of the Pint;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Northampton Brewery (MA);On tap: Amber hue with a small fizzy head and fair lace. Aroma hinted of butternut, pine, vanilla, and citrus. Very well balanced brew was the right amount of sweetness and bitterness. The finish was a touch salty, nutty and bitter. Very smooth and creamy, good mouthfeel. A very quaffable session brew, recommended as a starter beer for the day. Always like to help a good cause.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);12oz can poured into a shaker. Pours a pale clear gold with a half finger of white head. Aroma of corn and grains with a little green apple. Taste is light sweet. Mostly corn and grain with something slightly metallic. Light bodied with a thin texture. Fizzy carbonation and not much of a finish. Overall, meh. Not awful but nothing special either.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can. Corn syrup and barley malt aroma. Pale yellow with giant white head. Mildly sweet corny malt flavor. 60 cents was still a bit high for this - also was glad that it had zero grams of fat - I really can�t handle all those high fat beers.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can: Pours medium gold with a tall sudsyhead. Scent is grain malt. Taste is sweet, lightly malted, lightly metallic.. It�s pretty much what you expect....but honestly, it�s not awful. I just can�t resist a cheap beer with a grandiose name.. After all, you just never know.... ..
Milwaukee Special Reserve Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);It�s no boston lagar but it�s not suposed to be. It�s a cheap light beer with no bitter after taste. Perfect beer for the river, lake, or deer camp!! It beats the hell out of bush light or keystone light!!!!
Milwaukee Special Reserve Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Seriously? Ok, they probably scrap the bottom of the barrel to get this stuff and then add in some urine for extra flavor. Mild aroma of beer with a good amount of skunk and urine to it, same with the taste but more watered down. I honestly wondered whether someone had pee�d in my beer when I wasn�t looking, and had I ever let go of my beer I probably would have thought that a likely scenario. A mild fizzy and frothy finish only further my suspicion of a urine additive being used. This is, by far, the worst beer I have ever had.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Pale pour with a small white head. Aroma of pale malts and corn, very light. Flavor is equally light and just what you would expect. Pale and watery.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"Swiped one from my Dad, his goal in life is to find the chepeset beer to drink; no regaurd for taste. 12 oz. can very light color very light taste & Aroma. slight bitter steely after taste. I hope this one does not cross my path again"
Milwaukee Special Reserve Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Off, somewhat bad water olfactory. Typically ubiquitous pale yellow appearance. Though palatable, has much of that melanie city brewing background in it. Processed bad water or well used metal tank something. Finish is barely acceptable without too much gag. Cheap and drinkable but other cheap beers cost as much and are a little smoother.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);$10 thirty pack. Good deal? Def. not. Watery taste from beginning to finish. Smells skunky, and is a very light yellow color.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can from Party Source. Poured pale color with a minimal fizzy white head that diminished quickly with virtually no lacing. Light grainy sweet aroma. Light body with a watery texture and soft carbonation. Light sweet flavor with a light sweet finish of short duration. I would not recommend the Ice and would not recommend this to a freind.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);24oz bad boy drank straight from the can. Very slight grain aroma. The taste is sweet, malty, but also fairly weak.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"12 oz. can, ""thanks"" to jackl. Clear, pale, bubbly yellow, with a medium, bubbly, off-white head that abates quickly. Nose of Saaz, corn syrup, and wet blankets. Sweet and syrupy, with no bitterness. At least the aftertaste is mild and not unpleasant. Light body, creamy, lightly effervescent, and a bit crisp. This is a poor, cheap lager. Overly sweet, with all the aroma that crappy adjuncts will get you."
Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"12 oz. can shared at the Hyatt one night during RBWG, and that night was called Wednesday. But who shared this? No one knows. Doesn�t fucking matter. Pours a pale clear gold with a white head that settles into a ring and film, leaving spots of lace in the glass. Notes of corn, metal, apples, minerals, and wet hay. Light-bodied, with moderate to medium carbonation and a clean, crisp mouthfeel. It�s okay. Most beers with ""Milwaukee"" in the name are going to give you a mixed bag, brother."
Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can - Hi octane notes. Pale cold with a small white head. Sweet corn and apple notes. Much milder than the nose.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can shared during RBWG 2016. Pours clear yellow with a creamy white head. The nose has some sharp sugary cereal, corn, white bread. Medium to heavy sweet flavor with more basic cereal, light paper, straw, meringue, white bread. Medium bodied with delicate carbonation. Sugary finish, mellow paper, no hops, some white rice, cereal. Not terrible.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can shared. Very pale clear gold pour with thin white head. Aroma is fruity, apple jolly ranchers, corn syrup. Taste is super sweet, candy, apple. Palate is light bodied, watery with light.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Bottle at RBWG 2016. Thanks jack! Nose is mostly candied Apple and soft honey. Super clear, pale yellow. Taste follows with light sugar tones as well. Not bad.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can split in the hotel lobby, RBWG �16, 03/02/16. Pale yellow blonde with a moderate off White covering. Nose is buttery, grain, cereal, vanilla, pale malt. Taste comprises corn husk, light vanilla, grain, cereals, pale malt, grass. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close. Bloom ooh giggle.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);710ml can. Pale pour no head aroma of sweet paper glue. Flavor is minerally and not at all that offensive.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);You see this can and it just exudes pure class. I�m speechless. The beer inside is wonderful as well. It�s got a metallic note which seems to come from hops, which is a good sign because that means they used hops or some sort of hop extract in the making of this beverage. It�s a bit sweet and very fizzy, which makes it come off a bit watery. The taste is not altogether bad tasting w/ lost of mineral character from the water. Normally, this mineral taste is something I associate w/ very fine pilseners and the like but I suppose water softening costs money so I�m unsurprised to find it in a cheap beer also. Overall, I reckon this beer is kinda good but in a bad way.
Pizza Port Dawn Patrol Dark Mild;Solana Beach, California, United States;Mild Ale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Keg at PP SB, 14/11/14. Chestnut brown with a moderate beige covering.

Pizza Port Dawn Patrol Dark Mild;Solana Beach, California, United States;Mild Ale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Tap at Pizza Port Solana Beach. Clear cola pour with medium tan foam. Good lacing. Nose is sweeter apple and cherry cola, some sweet rye bread and honey rolls. Taste is mildly soapy with small roasted malt, thick rye bread, honey wheat rolls. Palate ends up being a bit oily and not so thin for style. Hard to style to brew- comes across well.

Alpine Beer Company Scottish Ale;Alpine, California, United States;Scottish Ale;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Clear chestnut color. Mildy malty aroma. Small head. a good session beer. Thanks to iceman & dasilky for bringing it
Alpine Beer Company Scottish Ale;Alpine, California, United States;Scottish Ale;Alpine Beer Company (CA);This was fairly solid, though I was only able to have a small sample of it at the brewery. It had a nice rusty blackish color to it with a minimal amount of foam. Kinda odd maltish barely hoppy aroma. Had a solid body to it, nice malts all around, nothing stands out as great and nothing stands out as bad, so this is just another good solid average SD brew.
The Cidery Scudamores Scrumpy;Bridgetown, Australia;Apple Cider;The Cidery;An interesting, if somewhat confusing, after dinner Scrumpy. Tasted from the bottle into a chalice at around cellar temperature. Absolutely no �pssshht� when I cracked it and it poured a completely still, clear pale orangey gold. The aroma was absolutely enthralling and homely, which made it differ from the rest. Strong fresh pulped apples, so fresh I could almost reach in and grab them, with softer notes of pears, ground spices, cloves and a little prickly alcohol to tickle the nostrils. The clove-like waft strengthens and preludes each sip. Completely still on the tongue aside from a little prickle, and unexpectedly light in body. Apple flavours are quite soft but still manage to fill the mouth and seemed to be aged and simmered, and lightly sour. Interminglings of a spicy, herbal and clove-like combination cause it to be relatively dry and the husky, lightly warming alcohol finishes it off nicely in the back giving it a well defined uniqueness amongst the ciders I have tasted. It was actually quite refreshing, in which I just can�t see it being downed one after the other with that huge ABV. I liked it, another original cider from this surprising South West cider maker. Cheers!!! (33cL, Nookenburra Bottle-shop, bottling date unknown)
The Cidery Scudamores Scrumpy;Bridgetown, Australia;Apple Cider;The Cidery;This one is quite hard for me to rate because I have not rated many serious scrumpys. Looks wise it's a faint hazy gold amber. Sharp vinegar sour, lighter tropical fruity and spicy, (nutmeg and corriander) aroma. Flavour is a cross between a spicy balsamic vinegar and a strong low sweetness cider with plenty of registration at the back/sides of the mouth and tongue. Alcohol well masked by the sour aspect. Finish is mild sweet but with some dryness. I preferred their other ciders over this one. Venue adds significant points especially for natural outdoor early summer evening ambience, good Cajun food and blues music (female vocal /acoustic guitar). Nice place.
The Cidery Blackwood Stout Porter;Bridgetown, Australia;Porter;The Cidery;On tap at the brewery. Murky cola pour with a small off white head. Molasses and coffee in the aroma and flavour, probably the best of the lot.
The Cidery Blackwood Stout Porter;Bridgetown, Australia;Porter;The Cidery;Black in colour with a compact tan head that nearly lasted the distance. Milky roasted coffee taste, mild sweetness and a short finish. Re Rate 22/06/07. This recently won the gong at the Perth Beer Show and it is not hard to see why. Same descriptors as previous though now more complexity and depth also a longer finish. Beatiful!
The Cidery Blackwood Stout Porter;Bridgetown, Australia;Porter;The Cidery;Opaque black brown with decent size medium lasting beige brown crema. Medium intensity fresh lightly roasted coffee and biscuity malt aroma. Soft velvet smooth low carb body. Medium coffee and roasted malt start. Middle falls away somewhat to a flat generic cola character and flavour. Low sweetness finish and lighter sweeter malt finish. Very pleasant drinking
Northwoods Prickly Pike Pilsner;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Northwoods Brew Pub;The appearance is right. There is some malt character and even a little hops, but this is a small step above an industrial lager. If it were $12/ case, there would be some merit to it. As it, it barely seems like a craft beer. Drinkable enough I guess, and this is a hard style to get right.

Aroma of slightly sour, pale grainy malt. Body is thin and watery and hardly has any flavor whatsoever, apart from a faint tartness. WTF is wrong with this place?
Northwoods Prickly Pike Pilsner;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Northwoods Brew Pub;"Bottle thanks to Skyview. Poured bright golden, almost clear save for some very fine sediment.. about as much head on there as apple juice (about zero). Aroma was sickly sweet with honeycomb, corn, and fructose-infused caramels.. no hop presence in the nose.. what the hell is this? Flavor found bunches of honey and corn sweetness at the base with very mild grassy and herbal bitterness.. left some ugly vegetal and cardboard notes at the finish.. not good.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Imperial Flavored;AleSmith Brewing Company;Bottle at a tasting, shared by MisoW. Thanks! Black colour, small head. Raw intensity and complexity of character. Full body and moderate carbonation.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Imperial Flavored;AleSmith Brewing Company;Poured from a 2012 vintage, 750 ml bottle. Aroma is a bit oxidized with some light wet cardboard and more raisin, fig, prune and date than when fresher. Medium light roast notes with light chocolate and lighter caramel and toffee. Faint bourbon and oak notes. Not much coffee at all. Pours black with a medium sized, thick, dark mocha head that recedes steadily to a small film that lingers on the edges. Faint lacing and fairly long legs. Flavor is less oxidized with more chocolate notes. Lighter roast, caramel and toffee. Light coffee notes that linger a bit in the finish. Medium light bourbon and light oak with a bit of alcohol spice. Light raisin and faint fig, prune and date notes. Mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. Overall, this much age isn't good for this beer. I have had it plenty of times fresh or with a couple years and it's much better than this old bottle. But as I was drinking this bottle I went to check my rating and realized I never rated this before. I'd say it's best to drink within 2 or 3 years of bottling. Rating is for what I feel this beer deserves when fresh. This particular bottle would get a 6, 4, 7, 4, 14 for a 3.5.
AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Imperial Flavored;AleSmith Brewing Company;September 3rd, 2015 - The Alesmith Vietnamese Coffee stout is a premier beer, but the Bourbon Barrel Aged version is no slouch. With a smooth, opalescent look it offers classic and classy alcohol and oak notes, smoldering with ethanol. The taste is much gentler, both sweet and delicate, but also bold and robust. A licorice sweetness mixes with the taste of Japanese whisky, and a thinner palate let's everything shine through.
AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Imperial Flavored;AleSmith Brewing Company;On tap. Top tier aroma, full of oak barrel and vanilla scent, along with strong cocoa, coffee, roasted malt and bread crust. Flavor-wise, well-rounded balanced flavor combining the roasty and malty flavor with bourbon flavor. Nothing really stands out, but all are in one sip, expressing themselves in so many levels. Rich and heavy body with a caramel sweetness. I am very impressed with this beer.
AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Imperial Flavored;AleSmith Brewing Company;Cask of 2016 barrel at brewery. Pours jet black. Bourbon aroma, coffee, roasted malts. Taste follows, big bourbon brew. Thick, big body. Noce but the no co2, warmer and bourbon wasnt a plus for me on the perfect original.
Big River Grille Toasted Oat Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - English;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Couple of pints on tap. Mostly clear amber with a lasting disc of cream. Aroma is toasted grain, honey and a touch of resin. Flavors of toast, sweet oats, a hint of citrus and dry grass. Closer to light than medium body is easy to drink and has medium carbonation and a nice balance. Sad to say, but the G-B buyout actually improved this recipe from the original Big River Grille production.

Big River Grille Toasted Oat Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - English;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Enjoyed at the brewery from the beer engine. A clear copper color with a thick foamy head. Very light aroma that is indeed toasted and a bit nutty, much like an English bitter. Creamy, toasted, earthy flavor with sweet and metallic notes. Creamy medium mouth feel that is fairly wet. This is very much English styled pale ale.
Big River Grille Toasted Oat Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - English;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);"Draught. Pours nut brown, caramel with orange hints and a small frothy light tan head that leaves some lined spotty lacing. Smoky toasted oat malt, kind of ashy, with some fruit hop notes (berries). Smoky burnt ash starts to hide the toasted oat but the smokiness comes through with a hint of bacon and a moderately acidic hop character. It seems watery. Medium bodied and crisp, clean palate. A very noble attempt by the brewer but I think the ash flavor kills it; still an interesting attempt."
Big River Grille Toasted Oat Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - English;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Draught: The color is a clear copper-amber hue. There was a little head, that dissapated quickly. Little lacing. The aroma had a bit of pine and grapefruit hoppiness to it. The taste was somewhat bitter. It had a strong, but medium bodied malt backbone, but no overall sweetness. The oats have made the overall beer quite smooth and drinkable. A good beer!
Big River Grille Toasted Oat Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - English;Big River Grille & Brewing Works Chattanooga (Craftworks);Appearance is a reddish brown with little head.

Brek Chiara;Via Carducci 54 - Mestre (VE), Italy;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brek Ristoranti;Sampled draught at the brewpub. Cloudy pale orange. Fruity with notes of melon. Dry, soft maltiness, some esters. Low bitterness. Plain, but still interesting and well balanced.
Brewerkz Ashkenazy Lager;Singapore, Singapore;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brewerkz;Well, this is probably the big milestone so far. 100 was good but easily achievable, 200 pretty much the same with the subsequent centuries becoming more difficult as beer literally ran dry. So now 500 arrives with a beer that I am told only had this number as its brew run. This means only 300 litres of this has been made available to the world. Is it worth the SGD25 (AUD21/USD15) for the 640ml bottle? Does the fact that there are instructions that as I empty the bottle I can blow into it and get the sound of notes made famous by Ashkenazy? Who you ask? Bloody Philistines. Vladimir Ashkenazy has often been quoted as saying that for him music is indivisible. This conviction is borne out by his passionate engagement with so many different aspects of music-making, whether as conductor, piano recitalist or chamber musician or as the architect of large-scale projects encompassing the full range of musical activities. This was bottle number 250 of the 500 so hopes are high. Is this the first 5?? Aah nup. It is a good beer, dry, with a reasonable lager colour and head. There is a slight nuttiness with a musty undertone. This is not a negative thing however as it does at least distinguish it from other lagers. I hope I don't have to pay $50 for my thousandth.

Steirerman Wellness-Bier mit K�rbiskern-Extrakt;Wien, Austria;Flavored - Other;Ottakringer;Bottle in Vienna. Dark yellow. Strong, rich aroma that is also surprisingly hoppy. Rich taste, probably added to by the pumpkin, with good hops and a reasonably nice bitter aftertaste, though not really strong. Medium light body. The pumpkin taste is very slight, adding more of a malty body than a distinctive flavor.

Steirerman Wellness-Bier mit K�rbiskern-Extrakt;Wien, Austria;Flavored - Other;Ottakringer;330ml bottle shared by Tranquillity - thanks! Very pongy when poured. Definitely based on a beer, but with some bizarre additional aromas. Taste is a bit thin but quite refreshing at first - grainy and with a final hoppy bitterness, though not very sophisticated. Gets a bit nastier as you go down the glass. The hoppiness gets stickier and acrid, for example. There is a hint of the pumpkin seeds, I�ll admit to that, but that neither saves nor spoils the lager.
Steirerman Wellness-Bier mit K�rbiskern-Extrakt;Wien, Austria;Flavored - Other;Ottakringer;0.33 l green bottle from an Eurospar in Graz. Poured golden body with smaller head. Some herbal spiced aroma, pumpkin obviously, dusty, with some malt. Bitterish flavor, pupkin oil flavored, it shifted me back to the childhood when my granny cook it for something, don�t remember. Relatively full bodied and interesting, a pale lager with a bit of that enriching part. Finishes nice bittersweet with some sourish notes. Not so good, but interesting brew.

Deutlich besser als die dunkle Variante � was allerdings keine Kunst ist. Kann man durchaus als trinkbar bezeichnen. Reicht trotzdem nicht f�r ne Spitzenplatzierung.

Im Herbst 2018 ging die traditionsreiche Brauerei Pleite und wurde geschlossen. Die Markenrechte �bernahm Kulmbacher. Auch wenn ich kein Fan war, kann ich nachvollziehen wie entt�uscht man in Erlangen ist.

Definitely biting Little Creatures but there's a lot worse things to copy. Postscript: had it again and it was the most grapefruity tasting beer I've ever had - unbelievable. I guess having a sourish finish makes the grapefruit experience more authentic. (Numbers unchanged)

St Peters Brewery Real Ale;Sydney, Australia;Pale Ale - English;St Peters Brewery (Australia);had this under the name of Green Dragon but judging from the same ABV and stuff I think it must be exactly the same. a cloudy orange (virtually opaque) (not flashlight tested) fruity/bready ale, like coopers sparkling but flat, basically. all of the st peters beers have this soapy, soft sydney water taste that doesn't taste english at all. there are hops in there but they're just muted by the water. burtonised this could be ok. that's my theory anyways.

Flossmoor Station Off-Kilter Wee Heavy;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Chestnut hue with small but solid off-white head and fair lace. The aroma is roasted malts, peat and sea salts, sour apple, smoked wood, and nutty. Works well on the nose. Wow, the taste is just what I want from a scottish ale. It's malty and salty, a wood and smoked tone is added for your tasting pleasure. The fruit undertone gives complexity. The finish has a bitter and chalky nature, with a seaweed kick, nice. The mouthfeel is chewy and soft, but has some bite which I really didn't care for. This is worth the effort to make a trip to the brewery/restaurant. One of the better version of the genre found in the states. Highly recommended.
Flossmoor Station Off-Kilter Wee Heavy;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;What a fantastic treat from a brewery I had just about given up for dead (so many of their beers are either unremarkable or remarkably sad). Although mild, the beauties of this Scottish Ale lie in Flossmoor's ability to pull of the infusion of peatiness in a way that's not overbearing (see most reviews of Adelscott for overbearing peatiness). This beer is quite thick and looks like a glass of Coke, and is sweet as befits the style. Excellent!
Flossmoor Station Off-Kilter Wee Heavy;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Dark brown, cola color. Some reddish tints as well. Heavy sugar, caramel and malt nose. Medium bitterness in the taste with some faint hops in the finish. Overall it's quite thick, almost maple syrup tasting, but with a more bubbly mouthfeel. Heavy caramel and malt flavors, with that syrup sweetness. Enjoyable.
Flossmoor Station Off-Kilter Wee Heavy;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draught: A nice dark red/brown chestnut colour, wonderful fruity malt aroma: Concorde grapes, grainy pears, and plums. Full flavour with loads of sweet chewy nuts, and tasty malts. Sweet bourbon-esk alcohol and cotton candy notes as well. Smooth, though bitter, finish. . . a solid session ale I'd say.
Flossmoor Station Off-Kilter Wee Heavy;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Deep, hazy garnet with a thin, persistent head. A nice fruity, malty aroma. Toffee, chocolate, plum, raisin, slight roasting a light smoke charater. Fairly full mouthfeel, sort of chewy at times. The alcohol is present but not overpowering. Fairly fruity and sweet with a slight bitterness in the finish which attempted to balance. A decent Wee Heavy.
Flossmoor Station Off-Kilter Wee Heavy;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Pours a dark brown with a thin coating of off-white head. Very sweet caramel and light peat malt aroma. Body is syrupy and sweet with some lightly smokey notes. Finishes sticky and bittersweet. A little too sweet and could use some more balance, but otherwise a pretty good Scottish ale.
Flossmoor Station Off-Kilter Wee Heavy;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Dark color with little to no head. Sweet beer aroma, caramel-like scottish beer taste. Aftertaste is fairly dry but is still a tasty treat on a cool fall night.
Flossmoor Station Off-Kilter Wee Heavy;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;"Draft. This was originally ""Kilt Kicker Wee Heavy"" when it won First Place at the 2000 Chicagoland Brewpub Shootout and 2nd at the 2001 edition. This is one of Todd Ashman's last brews as brewmaster, and I don't know if the name change reflects a different recipe. In any case... Head is a little off, just leaves a spittle of bubbles on one side like dish soap, but that's just cosmetic. Deep garnet color with red highlights. An undercurrent of brandy and some raisins. A bit sugary, which seems to overwhelm a slightly dry hop bitterness. Re-rated: Taste has settled much better after six weeks. Now there's a peat smokiness that wasn't apparent before, more like a Scottish Heavy, and it's less sugary. Wo\rth bumping up another point."
Sockeye Lava Springs Lager;Boise, Idaho, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sockeye Brewing;Light hazy blond color with a creamy bright white head and lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma is very toasty with a light hop touch at the end, small notes of dms are present but this is definitely an all-malt lager. Flavor is initially sweet from the well chosen hops then a balanced maltiness takes over with a biscuit flavor and ends in a water chestnut mouthfeel. It finishes refreshing, not too too watered down but not too heavy. This is one of the best American Standards I've had, I'm sure because it was startling fresh, and in the brewpub, and made without adjuncts.
Rhenania Krefelder;Kreuztal-Krombach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Krombacher Privatbrauerei Kreuztal;Not much aroma. Head disappears quickly. Sweet malty flavour with strong metallic overtones.

Rhenania Krefelder;Kreuztal-Krombach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Krombacher Privatbrauerei Kreuztal;Sampled @ Ferienpark restaurant. Restaurant manager warned me about this beer-cola mix but I had to try it of course. Looks pretty awful, like muddy brown water from a nearby ditch. Smell and taste sweet malts, indeed cola, bit weird aftertaste. Average to decent body and carbonation. Oh well, at least I�ve ticked it off.

On December 31, 2008. Thought it was a regular beer when I ordered it, noticed fast that it was a mix, too bad. Clear dark brown color, rocky brown head. Sweet, spicy, lemon taste. Lemon scent. Smooth mouthfeel, low bitterness.
Rhenania Krefelder;Kreuztal-Krombach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Krombacher Privatbrauerei Kreuztal;on tap at alte m�nz in kaiserslautern. aroma of freshly washed clothes being removed from the machine. brown, caramel sweetness, pretty poor. of course i was drinking this because i had to try it, meanwhile those around me were enjoying andechser doppelbock dunkel on tap and other bottled andechser wheat beers
Rhenania Krefelder;Kreuztal-Krombach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Krombacher Privatbrauerei Kreuztal;This is the Rhenania Alt with added caramel. So, it is dark red/brown in colour with a sickly sweet caramel aroma. Initially, it seems Alt-like - then the cloying sweetness sticks to the palate. Oddly sweet, without being malty or having body. Perhaps a beer for a dessert course or for children to drink.

A golden beer with a whitish head and lacing. Phenolic harshness in the mouth. It seems to be aiming for crisp bitterness but doesn�t get there.

Ringwood Huffkin;Ringwood, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ringwood Brewery (Marston's);Oct 2009: Brown 500ml bottle, just out of date, poured into a UK pint sleeve glass. Amber-copper in colour, clear and fairly bright. The head retension was very poor, it left before it arrived. A mild hop smell, some toffee too. The toffee hints were in the flavour as well. Malty aftertaste took over from the toffee feel. Maris Otter barley, Fuggles and Goldings are the hops used. It�s name �Huffkin� comes from the Kentish tea cakes which are often flavoured with hops!

Hilltop Barleywine;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hilltop Brewing Company;2005 batch, on tap at the brewpub, of couse! Hazy orange-copper, big light tan head. Nose is sweet malts, brown sugar, caramel, toffee. Hops are there, but in the back seat. The flavor is an interesting amalgam of citrusy flavors and sweet brown sugary caramel flavors. Brandied & candied oranges come to mind. Never really had anything like it, and it is GOOD. Of special note is the lacing - a thick curtain that literally goes from the lip of the glass to the bottom, never wavering, even after the beer is gone. WOW!
Hilltop Barleywine;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hilltop Brewing Company;Pours amber. Aroma is awful, sweet with something that reminded me of stale vomit. Flavor was descent somewhat straightforward brown sugar and caramel. Decent except for that aroma.
Hilltop Barleywine;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hilltop Brewing Company;Good Barleywine. As stated alot like Bigfoot. Very murkey brown color and tan head. Very strong going down you can feel it in your soul.
Hilltop Barleywine;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hilltop Brewing Company;Muddy copper in color with a thick, tan head which has some nice staying power. This is definitely along the lines of Bigfoot, with a pronounced citric hop aroma and flavor. Quite malty to balance the hops and a little rough around the edges overall. Some butterscotch notes and mild alcohol on the tongue. Malt flavors are predominately caramel & toffee. Strong mouthfeel as you would expect. Not at all cloying. A good Barleywine, especially considering that this is their first crack at the style.
Hilltop Barleywine;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hilltop Brewing Company;Nice barleywine! Poured a orange-copper body with a medium off-white head. Nose is powerful! Hops, citrus, and some malt. The taste is more citrus-orange and grapefruit-along with full hop character and some caramel notes. Some alcohol decides to creep in on the tongue and during the finish. Bitter finish due to the hops but such a nice beer! Very similar to Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot Barleywine.
Hilltop Dunkelweizen;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Hilltop Brewing Company;They where selling this for $2 as a special, now I know why its was a botched batch as was evident from a fairly distinct vinegar/tart cider aroma and flavor. Aside from the vinegar the aroma and taste where of a mild wheat, a very slight banana and a very mild caramel.
Hilltop Dunkelweizen;Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Hilltop Brewing Company;Poured a clouded brown. Nose is filled with banana, clove, malt, some yeast and spice. The body was filling. More banana and clove with a hint of coriander and wheat. A splash of yeast enters into the fray towards the end. Good beer! Like a slightly weaker Aventinus.
Ellicott Mills Kolsch;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Ellicott Mills Brewing;Haven�t had this in a couple years. From what I remember it was excellent for a kolsch and tasted like it came right from the Rhineland. Sad they took this off their taps.

Ellicott Mills Kolsch;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Ellicott Mills Brewing;Draft at the brewpub. Light and crisp. Watery. Not much character, too thin on the palate. Sweet light malt tones. Distant yeast notes have slightly grown on me my the end.

Tekel Birasi;Istanbul, Turkey;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anadolu Efes;Mild, lasch, feinherber Mittelteil. Ein ziemlich langweiliges Lager, einfallslos. Test vom 19.4.2006, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 9,7,9,8,5,9 - 8,35
Tekel Birasi;Istanbul, Turkey;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anadolu Efes;"bought in Kizilagac - clear and pale golden colour with a little foam left; shy corny nose with light oily grassy notes; quite watery and with a late tartness; short corny finish - poor"
Tekel Birasi;Istanbul, Turkey;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anadolu Efes;"My ninth Turkish tick of the trip, and the first (I think) not brewed by Efes (EDIT: actually, it is!). 330ml bottle. Deeper gold than the shandyish concoction I just saw off, and more substantial with an intriguing buttery malt character. Slick and full with a sherbety fizz; pine needle slivers rounding into pleasant, malt-derived sweetness hinting at lemon curd on Jacobs cream crackers. Aroma pine and flour. A touch buttery and wafery in an almost Black Country-esque way. Nothing wrong with this: the tastiest Turkish lager I�ve encountered so far. Fine."
Tekel Birasi;Istanbul, Turkey;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anadolu Efes;a very average beer, which by turkish standards is pretty good! from other comments sounds like it�s best sampled at source, as the bottle I drank in turkey had no off aromas or flavours. it was pale and slightly hazy, with citrus hop aftertaste
Tekel Birasi;Istanbul, Turkey;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anadolu Efes;Bottled. Golden colour,some sediment, small head. Sweet and mildly cardboardy. Light-medium bodied with notes of corn and mush mouthfeel. No bitterness. Probably not in mint condition anymore, but as it�s retired there is no hope of finding any fresher ever.
Tekel Birasi;Istanbul, Turkey;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anadolu Efes;Strong but musty aroma that isnt very appealing, this sweetish, malt dominated, pale yellow lager with a white head & bitter aftertaste seems by recent ratings to have improved during Mey�s ownership. Mores the pity then that they should have now given up the unequal struggle to turn round a beer with admittedly a poor reputation & closed the brewery. Even more so as this was probably the only remaining indiginous Turkish beer with a true Turkish taste. Rated from 1 of the 2 remaining 500ml bottles I have - RIP
Tekel Birasi;Istanbul, Turkey;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anadolu Efes;sweet, very much malty. pale lager, almost the best in TR. a must taste... .
Tekel Birasi;Istanbul, Turkey;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anadolu Efes;Bottled. Has this well known aroma that�s found in so many warm countries. It�s sweet, malty, floral. Not to my likings but not really bad either. Pale yellow, white head, good lace. Light maltsweet, light floral, light bitter. Overall quite watery but especially in the finish. Also leaves some herbal bitterness in the very finish. Not bad - I had much worse from other Asian countries - but not good either. Thanks Hans for bringing this over.
Tekel Birasi;Istanbul, Turkey;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anadolu Efes;Ouch! Very pale colored. Thin head. Nose was very unappealing. Actually caused me to make a face. Awful!! Yucky!!

Hancock Lys;Skive, Denmark;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Hancock Bryggerierne;Creamy white fair mostly deminishing head. Very pale yellow colour. No aroma. Almost no flavor. Really close too water. Short finish. Exstreme watery palate. This may be the worst danish beer with more than 0,5 ABV!

Fitgers Vanilla Cream Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Fitgers Brewhouse;Very very tasty, but I'm not sure if I can really distiguish this from their Oatmeal Stout. Perhaps a bit sweeter. Great color, lacing, deep flavors, really an excellent brew. This is a really good stout and Fitger's always delievers a great atmosphere.
Fitgers Vanilla Cream Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Fitgers Brewhouse;Had at the end of dinner celebrating my 10TH anniversary.

Stoney Creek Rivertown Amber;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Stoney Creek Breweries;draft at brewery. normal amber color, with a touch of hops hidden in the aroma. very malty and sweet, also with just a touch of hops hidden in the body at the end. a very drinkable amber ale, but nothing outstanding. drink the porter, since it should be on tap at the same time.
Stoney Creek Rivertown Amber;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Stoney Creek Breweries;Tap at the brewery. Medium orange/red, mostly clear, with a big slightly off-white head. Only the slightest aroma of light roasted barley. Starts out moderately acidic, with some sour hops flavor and a very dry roasted barley flavor. As it finishes there is a touch of malt, but mainly a grainy barley flavor with a good amount of perceptible alcohol. Body is medium and holds up well as it warms. Flavor lacks any true complexity and needs a good deal more malt. Unexpected spicy hops flavor (tettnang mabye?) adds a few points in my book.
Lunar Red Moon Rye-sin (Roggen);Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lunar Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub after a long hiatus. Just recently tapped, so the pour was a somewhat cloudy, reddish amber, with modest, light tan foam to the head, and clingy sheeting to the lacing. The aroma presented a light hint of yeast, light grain, plentiful malt, mid-fruit notes, and just a touch of peppery spiciness to the nose. The flavor continued the smooth malt and light spiciness, and added a moderate hop bitterness. Medium bodied, good carbonation, crisp and flavorful.
Lunar Red Moon Rye-sin (Roggen);Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lunar Brewing Company;On tap at lunar. Poured reddish amber with a finger of white head. Taste is a nice balance of malts and hops with a rye bready-ness to it, which is pretty tasty. A very pleasing beer

Lunar Red Moon Rye-sin (Roggen);Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lunar Brewing Company;Mostly translucent and copper-orange in color with a dense, one-piece foamy off-white head. Rye, hops, pine and citrus work together for the aroma formation. Rye and hops predicate other flavors. Tingly pumpernickel chips help to enforce the spicy rye character. An orange-like vibrancy carries through with a most impressive balance, transitioning into orange flavored toffee. One of the best ryes that I�ve had.

Lunar Red Moon Rye-sin (Roggen);Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lunar Brewing Company;"The name�s been changed to ""Red Moon Rye-sin�"" and the ABV has been booted up to 6%. Advertised as a ""hoppy Roggen rye ale"" - hey, they�re good brewers, not grammarians - this is indeed a nicely spiced up concoction. I�m not sure if that�s the Roggen or the rye - - just kidding. Pouring a hazy copper body with a creamy head (the latter being almost trademark for Lunar), it has a fruity (mainly citric) nose with plenty of herbal hops. It�s got a surprisingly light flavor, orange and perhaps grapefruit, with a goodly dabbing of earthy hops bitterness. The rye (or, Roggen?) really comes through in the peppery, spicy finish. Very nice drink. Lunar Brewing Company, Villa Park, IL"
Lunar Red Moon Rye-sin (Roggen);Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lunar Brewing Company;Typical amber color with a nice looking head. Rye base is very strong and is a nice change of pace from a typical amber. Hops and malts make it tasty to drink and was easy to enjoy.

Alcatraz Old Glory Stout;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Stout;Alcatraz Brewing Company;"Probably the best offering from Alcatrax so far. A ""stout"" for the masses.

The flavor was predominately light hops with a hint of malt. Smooth mouthfeel and light-medium in body. Quaffable, easy to drink, balanced, but nothing special to write home about with this beer as nothing stood out about it and lacks any real character. Not one that I want again.

Good yellow flecked off-white head and very hazy. Aroma has plenty of light raspberries in it, a huge dose of yeast and some drier malt. Flavor immediately is moderately astringent stemming from a dry fruit flavor (blueberries, raspberries, cherries). The yeast makes a big appearance and as the beer begins to finish, a candi-like sugar flavor makes an entrance. Very interesting beer. It starts out dry and waxes sweet. Very yeasty, doughy finish. Body is only medium, touch of wateriness. Some earthy/root-like spiciness in there as well. Bizarre, it certainly is. Take away the overly astringent flavors and I'd be sold.

Cloudy orange brown, rapidly dissipating off white head and low condition. Low earthy yeast in the nose with some fruity ester notes developing, overly sweet and yeasty in the mouth with a general lack of condition not helping matters, some clovey esters emerge but only serving to through it a little more out of balance, slightly tinny finish with a little sweet yeastiness lingering but altogether a little too close to Erding (both in flavour profile and location) for my tastes.

Gr�nbacher Schlosstaler Leichte Weisse;Gr�nbach, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Schlossbrauerei Gr�nbach (Arcobr�u);Bottle picked up from REWE Zolling, consumed at home Attenkirchen, Wednesday 1st May 2019. Pours pale lemony/light gold with a white head. Having consumed four alcohol free beers today I thought that I would take a risk and go for a 2.8% Leichte Weisse, it's not bad but if given the choice between this and alcohol free then for the barely discernible taste difference I would probably go for the alcohol free every time. It's got a little more bite, however the nose is subtle, light citrus in the mouth. It's a bit disappointing if truth be told.

Victory Helles Lager;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Something crispy as a change of pace to the summer hazy juicy IPA trend. Has a little malt to it, but could use more hops to balance out. This is how I usually view this style, so the lagers I like more are a little crispier like pilsner or Kolschs. Maybe a little better than the average Helles. I have been liking Victory's summer beers lately, but this is one I would pass on in the future.
Victory Helles Lager;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Bottle via BD Online. It pours clear yellow with a a dissipating white head.

The taste is crisp, dry, soft fruity vibes, cereal, grassy, toasty grain, doughy bread and sponge cake with a dry finish. Average body and fine, foamy carbonation. Quite a malty lager - plenty of sponge cake. Pleasant stuff.

Light white head, Little bit of film on glass. See the carbonation bubbles flowing. Light bodied and golden in color. Taste the grains and sweet. Not much after taste.

Victory Helles Lager;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Pours a clear, light golden color, thin ivory head. Nose is pretty subdued, some sweet grainy malts, a faint floral hint. The sweetness persists on the tongue with with a lingering bitterness. Pretty smooth though. A very relaxed beer and a decent take on the style.
Victory Helles Lager;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);From May 2007 I received this in a trade with jwc215...thanks, Joe! This pours from 12oz bottle(best by Jun 19 07) a clear, bubbly straw gold colour with a large head of foam. It settles down after a while but stays for the entire session as a fine layer and there's lacing. The smell hasa pretty hoppy aroma mixed in with some malty tones. The taste on first sip has a nice hoppy presence... I'm getting some lemon zest. Further sips in and there's some non sweetish malt and bread there but they are on the light side. It finishes crisp and clean and makes for a good thirst quencher. The body is light as is the carbonation. I like this one and it has a good German feel to it. Bottom line: This is a good Lager...no bells or whistles, just a good solid Lager. I'd drink it again.

Sly Fox Petes Peerless Ale;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Poured a dark brown color with some amber tones. The head was nice and the lacing very good. The aroma was more hoppy than anything. The flavor was like a balanced pale ale (with more color that didn�t turn into deeper flavor for me) with a sweet malty base. Pine and floral flavors were most pronounced and this was a less than impressive brown ale (flavor rated lowest due to a complete mismatch to the style).
Sly Fox Petes Peerless Ale;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Mild sweet toasted malts with herbal and light citrus hops in the aroma. Clear brown body with low white head that recedes to ring. Floral and grapefruit hops are strong in the flavour with a lightly toasty malt profile and mild bitterness. Medium light body with fair carbonation. Yet another one from this brewery that comes across as an amber ale. Sampled on tap at the brewpub with beerbuzzmontreal, egajdzis, Eyedrinkale, MartinT, Rastacouere and Yowie.
Sly Fox Petes Peerless Ale;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Diminishing off-white head covering a orange-red hazy hue. Grass tasting hops take a lot of room in this otherwise toasty, cocoa induced malty ale. Mineral on the tongue, with biting carbonation and a light-medium bodied. It does grow mild alcohol vapors that combine with the considerable roastiness and assertive flowery hopping to finish a bit astringent, but otherwise remain a clean and straightforward example.
Sly Fox Petes Peerless Ale;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Pours a reddish amber color with a thin offwhite head. Aroma of nuts and citrusy hops. The flavor is the same : citrusy hops and nuts. The body is light to medium with a creamy texture and soft carbonation.
Sly Fox Petes Peerless Ale;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Sly Fox Brewing Company;The Lure: Wooden hop resins roam atop the dryish malts. For a brown ale, this isn�t nearly sweet enough, and roasted enough to please. The Festivities: Hoppier than their Challenger IPA, believe it or not, citrus hops teem amongst the disgruntled roastiness. This is a pint made for quaffing while offering flavors that are slightly different to what people are used to. They shouldn�t call this a brown ale though. Transcendence: Another day at the office.
Sly Fox Petes Peerless Ale;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Draught @ Brewery: Smells hoppy, piney, and spicy with hints of cream and choclate. Big white head. Copper in color. Clear. No lacing. Flavors of orange, malt, and lots of hops. Also chocolate and vanilla notes. VERY lively carbonation. Medium bodied, but barely. Very well balanced. A different pale ale, but good.
Sly Fox Petes Peerless Ale;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Sly Fox Brewing Company;"Tap. This is pretty much the Phoenix Pale Ale with added malts. I enjoy the pale ale greatly, and this is more like the balanced version of it. It�s very drinkable, and tasty as well. It pours a golden brown color with hints of ruby. The aroma is full of hops and spice; the malts aren�t really detectable until the taste. Very palatable and drinkable."
Sly Fox Petes Peerless Ale;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Sly Fox Brewing Company;This is a great american brown ale. lots of chocolate malts give a nice light chocolate aroma with lots of nutty hints. Flavor is toasted and crystal malts, and hoppy all around. Nice clean and smooth finish.

Layla Dirty Blonde Lager;Ashkelon, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Israel Beer Breweries (Carlsberg);Pours up clear copper with minute long off white head. The aroma hits first with grainy malts and cereal before noble floral and spicy hops take over. I think I get a background of earthiness in there too. The taste has a pulse of sweet sugar flavored malts first that are quickly consumed by mild grains, floral and spice hops bitterness. The floral hops and grains run into the finish with a hint of earthiness picking up somewhere along the way and hanging into the after taste. Interesting brew and pretty decent for the style.

Sequoia Pale Ale;Fresno, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Sequoia Brewing Company;My Bottom Line: Spicy hops and their piney bitterness scent this American Pale Ale�s light cereal sweetness, building a very drinkable example of the style. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam laces a bit atop the clear golden amber. -This may have been served too cold for my preference, but it remained my favourite session beer of theirs, out of the 4 I had. -The aroma does not make you expect the brightness of the hops in the flavour profile and finish. -The malts don�t have much personality, but they do contribute to the crisp, engaging mouthfeel. On tap at the north Fresno location.

Sequoia Mineral King IPA;Fresno, California, United States;IPA;Sequoia Brewing Company;I agree with (redave). This is one of the better IPA�s I have tried .

Legacy Duke Of Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Legacy Brewing Co.;Notes from Desmond Brew Fest 2005. I am almost certain that I rated this in the past.

Legacy Duke Of Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Legacy Brewing Co.;great smell, good taste, but it has a metallic after-taste, drinkable, nice lasting head.
Legacy Duke Of Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Legacy Brewing Co.;Very woody and floral hop aroma, lended quite a bit of piney bitterness, the malt profile was rich, almost earthy. Robust alcohol content made it slighty harder to drink than I would like.

Legacy Duke Of Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Legacy Brewing Co.;on draft at canal street pub about a block from the brewery. This brewery is off to a great start. They don�t have much of a selection yet, but what they have is just fine for now. this is a solid IPA all the way! complex and tasty. hazy auburn appearance with 1 and 1/2 inch frothy white head. begins sweet, then rich and MALTY, followed by a nice spicyness in the finish with some distinctive caramel and hops too. slightly unbalanced with malt coming out on top, but the hops are in there...don�t worry. givr� a try if you�re in the keystone state sometime. you�ll be glad you did. overall...a tasty treat and would gladly purchase this when it�s made available in bottles in a couple of months. (hopefully) ...also tried legacy pilsener. this must be a new addition to the legacy family, as it is not yet listed on this site. decent pils, not great, but far from bad. malty up front with some hops and slight fruitiness in the finish. kinda bland compared to others.

Millis Tuggies Mild;Dartford, Kent, England;Mild Ale;Dartford Wobbler (prev Millis Brewery);Reddish brown colour. Vague berry fruit aroma. Flavours are muted with some toasty malt and maybe a hint of licorice. Sweetish and a touch thin. A bit nondescript really, but it�s soft and easy drinking in a quite traditional style. Which, of course, is part of the raison d�etre of milds, so it wouldn�t be right to be critical because of it�s lack of depth. In other words, a perfectly decent session beer, but not one to analyse too much. Cask (handpump), Wenlock Arms, London.
Millis Tuggies Mild;Dartford, Kent, England;Mild Ale;Dartford Wobbler (prev Millis Brewery);Cask@The Wenlock Arms, London. Quite a thin and particularly light mild.

Roosters Blind Jack;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Roosters Brewing;Cask@Purebar. Purecraft. Whatever it�s called, Birmingham, 29/09/15. Thick capped pale ruby. Silken rather lifeless nick with unremarkable jellied red berry and orange emerging. Nose of redcurrant and soft wine gum. Possibly a whiff of smoke for dessert but it could be the preceding Americano. Grenadine as it warms. Generally a beer as sterile and insipid as the cheesy 80s synth soul piped into the venue I�m taking it in.
Roosters Blind Jack;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Roosters Brewing;Cask conditioned at York Beer Festival �15. Amber with white head. This is a light, malty beer, cereal notes with fruity, berry notes, some cereal, some light bitterness. It�s okay.

Mountain Crest Rani Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Aroma is caramel, toffee and sugary adjunct.Taste is light sweet grains, caramel and corn sugars. A light basic tartiness follows. Pretty basic flavors and almlst a sugary film follows at finish. Appearance is a clear gold body with a thin pearl head that retains fairly poorly.
Mountain Crest Rani Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Pale yellow body, thin white head. Grassy aroma and weak taste. Overall a poor brew.
Mountain Crest Rani Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Grassy with a low end lager taste. I was wondering what went wrong and then found out it�s brewed by Minhas. Now we know!
Mountain Crest Rani Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;"This beer is terrible. I was at an Indian Food restaurant and asked my server to bring me something that was brewed in India. He arrived with this. It was already opened and he was pouring it. By the time I read the label to find out it was ""Minhas"" (read ""liquid garbage"") it was sitting in front of me. I decided not to be a dink and call the server back to complain and to just drink the beer. You�ve got to slum it once in a while to appreciate the finer things in life (read: everything other than this beer). Story aside this was actually the worst beer I have ever had that wasn�t spoiled. It was sweet and sticky and tasted like some kind of sewer water that you poured a Molson Canadian into."
Mountain Crest Rani Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;341ml bottle pours a pale golden color with a finger and a half of white head that goes away quickly and leaves no lacing. Aroma is cereal grains and grass. Taste is light malty sweetness with an undesirable hop bitterness. Just another macro swill from the Minhas family which knows nothing about craft brewing.
Mountain Crest Rani Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Pours yellow with no head. Light and skunky aroma. Mild hop flavour. Drinkable but not great.
Mountain Crest Rani Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Low end beer. Designed to be eaten with spicy Indian food. I�d rather have a good beer with my Indian food, thank you very much.
Mountain Crest Rani Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Wow, nothing says India like a beer made in Wisconsin, owned and marketed by a guy from Canada. And nothing says �Guaranteed to suck� like Minhas brewing. This beer is that winning combination. Pours clear gold, thin white head, no lacing. Nose is cardboard, butter, that vague �our water comes from a sewage treatment plant� character that always let�s you know you�re drinking a Minhas product, plus corn. Mmmm... Corn. Flavours are quite remarkably unpleasant, think Axehead Malt Liquor, only this is actually worse: buttery corn and sweet sweet sewage. Only my token �Still better than Molson Canadian� pity point awarded. Perfectly, exquisitely dreadful
Mountain Crest Rani Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;**review from June 27, 2008*** Uh, crap?? Hard to believe but it is the truth. My review is a bit old and I swear that I�ve still seen this for sale... they try to make this look like an Indian beer and they do well by making it taste light garbage. Dumped out a small foamy white head on a yellow gold beer, no retention. Taste like corn and skunk and this just totally sucks ass. Smells like it tastes. Ick bitterness. Total garbage that is somehow drinkable. Die, Minhas. I hate those people.
Mountain Crest Rani Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;"Is this only marketed to us schmuks in Alberta?

I agree with pintbypint�s mild rant below, that this is pure piss from a contract brewer who apparently thrives on digging little niches in regions across North America. Another laugh: on the top border of the label is the phrase ""since 1845"". What? Could you be more vague maybe? Do you mean you�ve been brewing shitty beer since 1845? Bravo! Carry on Captain! And while your at it, why don�t you piss in a few more bottles, slap a label on them with a panda eating bamboo in the middle of a rice paddy, and carve yourself another niche market?"
Bison Organic Belgian Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Tripel;Bison Brewing Company;bottle - Cloudy gold pour, spicy aroma with obvious coriander along with yeast, malt and a hint of fruit. The flavor is sweet, spicy and yeasty. There�s some alcohol presence. Medium bodied. It�s alright though underwhelming for the style.
Bison Organic Belgian Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Tripel;Bison Brewing Company;"""this is an ok beer. it holds up slightly better to other beers of the style than their chocolate stout does. it does nothing to separate itself, however. maybe worth trying, but not going back to."""
Bison Organic Belgian Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Tripel;Bison Brewing Company;"22oz bottle - The beer pours out a pale golden yellow body, clear with a 1"" white airy cap. Aroma is slightly sweet, a touch spicy, some corriander and rubber. Aroma has that candi-malt flavor blended with dried pitted fruit and not overly spicy. Residual sweetness is left behind which helps out the fruity notes come out a little more. Not bad, and a decent introduction to the style for a newbie."
Bison Organic Belgian Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Tripel;Bison Brewing Company;I will just say I liked this but it needs to warm up because if you drink it cold there is a rubbing alcohol aftertaste. most of the other reviews explained it pretty well weather they liked it or not.
Bison Organic Belgian Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Tripel;Bison Brewing Company;Bomber. Pours a hazy golden with a fluffy whtie head- fades a bit though. Aroma is toasty, spicy phenolics, honey sweetness and some off fruitiness- some banana and apple. Flavor is toasty malts, bready, grass, herbs spicy peppery phenolics and fruity ester with a moderate sweetness in the end. A bit too sweet and not dry enough.
Bison Organic Belgian Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Tripel;Bison Brewing Company;Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Aroma is citrus spicy yeast, a nit of alcohol. Grain on the nose and plalate. A little banana. Not terrible, not great.
Bison Organic Belgian Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Tripel;Bison Brewing Company;22oz bottle from BevMo. Pours a deep golden color with a faint orange hue. Nose was lightly fruity with some citrus, toasted malt and some grainy qualities. Finishes crisp and a little grainy.
Bison Organic Belgian Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Tripel;Bison Brewing Company;Not true to style and the coriander they mention on the label was nowhere I could find. The alcohol burn was up front and I could sense a wee bit of banana behind the very forward bitterness. Overall, unbalanced and with a sour finish. One of the few times Bison has disappointed.
Bison Organic Belgian Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Tripel;Bison Brewing Company;Bomber. Pours slightly hazy orange with a thin white head. Odd combination of grass, fruit, coriander, grain, yeast, and alcohol. Objectively, I would say this is a bit harsh and unbalanced, and a pretty odd tripel. But subjectively I find the particular combination of flavors rather enjoyable, and would buy it again.
Bison Organic Belgian Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Tripel;Bison Brewing Company;Tasted at GABF 2008. Hazy orange pour with thin head. Nose of grains and coriander. Flavor is yeast, wheat, spices and coriander.
Fuller's Vintage Ale 2003;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);a touch hoppier than in earlier vintages but the same depth of malt that keeps me coming back most years. good stuff.
Fuller's Vintage Ale 2003;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Bottle from Sainsbury�s, Darlington. 2003: Drank 2014-08-21, Score 5. Aged for 11 years. A dark amber coloured beer that pours with a creamy foam head. It has burnt toffee, currants and warming rich red fruity flavours, spicy and peppery hops followed by liquorice, oak and leather and alcoholic warmth on the finish. Very Good indeed!
Fuller's Vintage Ale 2003;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);24th May 2013 Bottle at Akkurat. Bottle 48130. Bloody expensive but good to catch up with at last! Clear amber beer, good pale cream coloured head. Slow gushed for about a minute and then settled down. Palate is softish and airy. Semi dry with fine carbonation. Clearly aged this is nonetheless tasty beer. Sweet caramel malts, slight Madeira streak. Mild sweet dried fruits. Whisper of paper. Finishes semi dry. Well integrated and smooth but obviously past it�s best.
Fuller's Vintage Ale 2003;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Bottle at Akkurat. It pours deep mahogany brown, thin off-white head. The nose is rather sweet, tangerine, orange peel, Christmas cake, spice and Brown sugar. The taste is wood, leather, brown sugar, honey, date, raisin, currant, spice and orange pith, with a very dry finish. Full body, fine carb and slightly sticky mouth-feel. An enjoyable beer, but not one of the best Fuller vintages.
Fuller's Vintage Ale 2003;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Vertical tasting with 2001, 2008, 2009 and served in Fuller no--nik pint glass: App :Slightly hazy deep amber with mahogany highlights, small frothy head and some spotty lace. Aroma: Very heavy marzipan and crystal malt influence, grassy and noble hops, some minty and dill esters, a touch of lemongrass and heather, raisins and dates. You can almost smell an old wool sweater when approaching this beer. The taste starts with heavy marzipan, prune, pear, bready and yeast. Unlike the great FVA of the past this never seems to go to another level. Almost one dimensional which I find almost shocking. Seems too sweet and bready versus that forceful noble hop character often found with these. I was very happy to land a bottle of 2003 but now I tasted it, I would rather have many bottles of the easier to find 2009. This did not age nearly as well as 1998, 99, nor 2001. That makes me sad.
Fuller's Vintage Ale 2003;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Bottle conditioned, 500ml, No. 04341. Chestnut with beige head. Super beer, smooth, malty and port like, warming on a cold night with tints of alcohol. The hops are still present in a peppery like note. Great stuff.
Fuller's Vintage Ale 2003;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);500ml bottle, No. 51280, many thanks to Richard for sharing. Pours an orange-amber coloured body, partly cloudy and with a tiny, but lasting, filmy layer on the surface. Smooth aroma of dried fruits and sweet malts. Rich, blended flavour of dried apricots, plums, raisins and prunes on a backbone of soft tartness. Discreet hints of yeast. Long-lived, bittersweet tail. Rounded and soft in the mouth. A tasty drink for very special occasions (dinner party, Tromsdalen 24.10.2009).
Fuller's Vintage Ale 2003;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Pours copper with a thin white head. Smells of fruit, caramel, spice, citrus. Tastes resiny with some fruity hints and caramel. Finish yields some earthiness.
Fuller's Vintage Ale 2003;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Poured a fizzy mahogany with a small fizzy/frothy off-white head. Aroma of red wine grapes, dark fruits, a bit of piney hoppiness. Flavor follows with fruit notes, biscuit and toffee, a bit of alcohol. Body starting to feel a bit thin and flat after four or five years. Overall still has a nice flavor profile to it, even if perhaps a tad degraded.
Fuller's Vintage Ale 2003;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);500 ml. brown bottle. Part of a vertical tasting held for my close friends. Poured out a deep amber color, with orange highlights. Small tan head fades quickly. Aromas are of rum soaked dried fruit, orange jam, some earthy hops. Flavors are of orange jam, rum soaked raisins, strong malts. Thick mouthfeel, rich & chewy. Finished slightly dry, but really good overall.

Michelsbr�u Hexe;Babenhausen, Hesse, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Privatbrauerei Michelsbr�u;Geruch ist sehr hopfig-frisch. Der Antrunk ist s�ffig-vollmundig und ganz leicht s��lich. Im Hauptteil kommt eine etwas herbere Note durch, die im Nachgeschmack etwas muffig-penetrant wird. Auf der Zunge bleibt eine herbe Note h�ngen, die mir schon etwas zu stark ist.

Arkells James' Real Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Arkell's Brewery;A Sim rate (cask at the Doric Arch): 4 for aroma, and lucky at that! Very malty and smells a bit like wee. Unpleasant, to be kind. So regular amber coloured with OK lacing but acidic-looking head. Tastes better than it looks, but still not great. Tastes of malt and very strongly of corn. Really not very nice.

Sidestreet India Pale Ale;Houston, Texas, United States;IPA;Sidestreet Brewing;More of a true IPA, rather than a hopped up west coast version. Sweet malts throughout, the hops didnt really sucker me in like I feel they should have.
Sidestreet Brown Ale;Houston, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Sidestreet Brewing;This beer was the best of the ones I had at side street. Caramel and nuts in the aroma. medium bodied, lots of bitterness in the finish for a brown.
Sidestreet Blonde Ale;Houston, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sidestreet Brewing;One of the worst brewpub light beers Ive had. So much adjunct in the flavor, almost like fermented corn flakes.....no character or backbone to this beer. Obviously just something to appease the locals.

Portland Brewing Kornhausers Oast;Portland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Shared by Frankenstein, as I see the previous ratings, I think this one is past its prime, as the last rating was in �04! The nose and flavor were the same, which was malt and a touch of cognac. I�ve seen this in a few beers that were older in vintage. It�s hop presence completely disappears and the malt turns sweet and alcoholic. If you have a bottle kickin� around of this, save it for display, don�t bother drinking it.
Portland Brewing Kornhausers Oast;Portland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Again, another beer that I missed adding 2 years ago. Light golden color, medium head. Medium hopped, slightly malty ale. As an oast ale, the brew masters add an amount of distilled hop oil to the beer. Similar to, but not exactly like Portland Pale Oast Ale. A mild ale, with a aromatic hop aroma. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is very hoppy, yet not bitter.
Portland Brewing Kornhausers Oast;Portland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Ok saw this beer last spring..weird name..than I saw it today at the cheap canned food warehouse place..$2.99 a six..so here goes. Pretty average looking extra pale ale type beerdark yellow/gold..not much head..leaves a ring. certainlly smell the aromatic hops that this is brewd wioth..ok. taste is mostly bitter hops a small malt profile at the start..a fairly nice hop bite. Too watery in the mouth for my tastes but its not bad feeling. This is drinkable for the money I paid but if it were sale at regular MacT prices..not worth it.
McMenamins Uncles Daves Dunkleweissen;Portland, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On tap at the John Barleycorn�s mcmenamins. This was actually a nice dunkel, sweet caramel up front with a great banana and clove finish. Roasty at the right times then finished fairly dry with the spicy finish. Good weight on the palate (which kinda suprised me since most mcmenamins beers tend to be thinner bodied). Very nice dark brown color with a tall light tan head.
McMenamins Uncles Daves Dunkleweissen;Portland, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Had this beer at the Thompson Brewpub, in Salem. Came in a smooth sided pint glass. Pretty good looking Dunkle..cola brown in colour with a small off white head..but it was nice and frothy.. A fresh but rather subdued aroma..some wheat can be discerened but not much. A nice tasty beer..its like a cross between a chocolate stout and an American wheat beer..doesnt sound good? But it tasted great! Pretty average in the mouth..slight bitter aftertaste. Quite an unusual and drinkable beer.
Murauer Pils;Murau, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Murau;getrunken im Sommer 2012 Die Murauer Brauerei ist f�r mich als jene Brauerei, welche mit ihren Spezial-Radler-Getr�nken immer wieder Preise abr�umen. Man erinnere sich an das Preisel&bier. Leider ist das Pils meiner Meinung nach eine Fehlentwicklung. Der w�ssrige Geschmack reicht aber noch immer aus um widerliche Aromen nach Misthaufen zuzulassen. Von Bitterkeit und S�ure ist keine Rede. Wenn man sich mit Bier m�glicht schnell vernichten will, so lege ich ihm dieses Bier nur ans Herz.
Murauer Pils;Murau, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Murau;Malty aroma, bread is dominant. Golden color, clear. Big, white, creamy, solid head.

Murauer Pils;Murau, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Murau;From notes. Enjoyed at The Running Horse in Graz, Austria with Matt, Martin, Konny, and Alexis on January 12. Draft pour. The pour is a darker golden yellow with a great clarity to it. There is a thick bright white head that slowly falls down to a thin ring with a couple spots of lace. The aroma is full of bready malt and heavy grain. There is a bit of corn going on and a hint of metallic as you really get in there. The flavor is much of the same. The graininess doesn�t do it a whole lot of good, and the metallic aspect of the malt doesn�t help things either. The breadiness adds a bit of a sweet character to it that I don�t mind, but it�s not the best thing out there. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a brighter carbonation and a clean and crisp finish. The bready malts hang on for a moment, but it�s really clean. 5 4 5 4 13

Johansson's Whistlestop Amber;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Johansson's Dining House;Draft pint at the brewery pours very dark cola brown amber color. Wet, musty, lightly sweet, some toast and toffee in the nose, even some cocoa... most closely resembles a brown ale, more so than an amber. Some light toffee, toast, etc. tasted, even a little roast? I�m not sure. Light, medium to thin body, some maple at the end. Different, not terrible, but a bit plain.
Johansson's Whistlestop Amber;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Johansson's Dining House;A hazy dark amber beer with a thin light brown head. The aroma is sweet malty with light notes of caramel - in general it is a bit too light for my liking. The flavor is sweet with strong notes of caramel, on a good malt back ground combined with notes of toffee, and light butterscotch and hops, leading to a lightly bitter end.
Johansson's Whistlestop Amber;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Johansson's Dining House;Nice and fresh on draft. More of an brown ale, but very tasty. Good use of the malt and a crispier than expected finish. Nice brewpub.
Johansson's Whistlestop Amber;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Johansson's Dining House;A deep Coke color. Strong for an amber, not very representative of the style. Despite the color, it has a medium body and light taste, pleasant and well-balanced. Light hops show through a fairly heavy malting. A very pleasant brew.
Johansson's Oktoberfest;Westminster, Maryland, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Johansson's Dining House;A sedate orange color with minimal head. Virtually non-existant aroma, with just a hint of sweetness. Overall a slightly hoppy Oktoberfest with a powerful sweetness. Smooth on the palete.

Dominion Belgian Brown;Dover, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Well done Belgian Brown Ale, that I often enjoy on draught at the brewpub at Old Dominion. You can also find this beer as the house brew at the Tuskarora Mill in Leesburg, VA as Tuskie Ale. Pours to a beautiful, bright, deep chestnut to brown color, with a nice tan head, and a good carbonation. The nose is excellent, with lots of good sweet, carmel, and nutty malt, paired with estery and ripe fruit aroma, and earthy yeast aroma. The palate is rich and slightly slick on the tongue, with good sweet malt, caramel, and nut flavor. This is paired with some good, estery fruit, and hints of earth. This beer finishes with more of those flavors up front, then ends slightly sweet. Nice beer with good malty and estery aromas and flavor. Matches well with a number of dishes, and its a nice beer to fill your 2 liter growler to go with.
Dominion Belgian Brown;Dover, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);I had this on tap at the Old Dominion brewpub. Its came out a deep brown color with a slight beige head that left little in the way of lacing. The smell was of sweet fruit and caramel malt. The taste is very similar with sweet caramel malt being most noticeable and dark fruits also having a strong presence. There were definitely root beer like qualities that were in the taste and smell that made it an interesting beer. Mouthfeel was medium with a creamy texture. This was definitely drinkable as the lighter than normal body for the style allows this to go down much quicker. Not the best dubbel but an interesting twist that is solid.
Dominion Belgian Brown;Dover, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Nice, brown color and nutty aroma. The brown ale characteristics stood out more than belgian beer characteristics. Some maltiness. Decent beer.
Dominion Belgian Brown;Dover, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Rich bronze/brown colour. Well structured aroma with light malt, subtle hop and fruit (apricot). Similar flavours with candy sugar notes becoming apparent. Mellow, but not flabby, mouthfeel. Rather pleasant, but hardly Belgian in style, I�d say. On tap at the Dominion brewery.
Dominion Belgian Brown;Dover, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Spicy aroma, plenty of clove, some malt and toffee. Brown color, thin tan head. Earthy and spicy flavor, decent maltiness, but less than expected. Medium body. A spicy, slightly malty Belgian style beer. Lacks the fruitiness and complexity I expect from a good Belgian.
Dominion Belgian Brown;Dover, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pours dark ruby with a medium-sized head. Sweet aroma. Good flavor of spices, with a very good aftertaste. Not incredible, but a decent Belgian.

Dominion Belgian Brown;Dover, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Nice brown color. Tannish head. Spiced aroma, sweet, and a little malty. A different type of Belgian. Caramel and hops stick out in the flavor, with some different spices mixed in. Pretty decent! On tap at the Brew Pub in Ashburn, VA.
Dominion Belgian Brown;Dover, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Very slight belgian qualities... more of an english style ale... slight belgian yeast character, subdued hops... nothing outstanding
Downtown Grill Autumnfest;Knoxville, Tennessee, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Downtown Grill & Brewery;A light copper color with a frothy white head that lingered around the glass. Malty aroma, complex taste. Some spice possibly. Overall not too bad but not what I expected.

Back Road Christmas Ale 2003;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Stout - Imperial;Back Road Brewery;Thanks to BBB63 for this one. I was extremely impressed with this one. Pours dark brown with a big tan head and a lot of carbonation. Aroma of malt, cabernet, nuts, some hops, and fruit. The taste has hints of roasted malt, a solid chocoff flavor, and some almonds. The palate is great, with a firm, medium body. The finish throws even more chocoff, and I noted some almond/halelnutty/toffee flavors. This one is 1 part brown ale, 3 parts Impy stout, and 4 parts delicious!
Back Road Christmas Ale 2003;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Stout - Imperial;Back Road Brewery;Very black with light only coming through brown at the edges. The head is thick and dense and a nice light tan color with a slight grayish cast. It eventually fades, but takes forever. Prunes, chocolate and coffee in the aroma. With char and coffee taking a little free rein over the chocolate in the flavor. The flavor is a little thin, but overall a good beer.
Back Road Christmas Ale 2003;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Stout - Imperial;Back Road Brewery;Nice black color,small brown head that faded quickly.Fruity,malty aroma with coffee and chocolate.Nice malty chocolate coffee taste,decent hop showing with a mild hint of alchol towards the end of the tasting.Nice bitter dark chocolate,coffee after taste.This is a very nice brew that was surprisingly easy to drink and fairly balanced,well worth having a few more of these around for later.Thanks to BBB63 for sending this fine bonus brew my way.
Back Road Christmas Ale 2003;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Stout - Imperial;Back Road Brewery;opaque as can be, thick creamy dark tan head. has a big chalky aroma very reminiscent of freeminer deep shaft, not that much roastiness, but enough you can tell this is going to be thick and rich. surprisingly not sweet. mostly dry with a numbing moderately thick mouthfeel. thanks BBB63!
Back Road Christmas Ale 2003;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Stout - Imperial;Back Road Brewery;bottle-pours a pitch black with fairly smooth tan head-aroma of licorice, spice, nutmeg, plum, coffee, cinammon. Doesn't smell like an imperial at all. a spice stout? flavors ave very good and represent the aroma nicely. my only objection to the brew was the palate-kinda thin and over-carbonated. Slight metallic notes on the finish. I think aging this would do good work. Thanks BBB63!
Back Road Christmas Ale 2003;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Stout - Imperial;Back Road Brewery;Dark ruby with walnut highlights. Thin, tan foam ring. Lackluster aroma with emphasis on the roast and soured plums and not much else. Mild toastiness with peanut, black malt, yeast, and ink hints. Rather airy and acidic. Soft, gentle carbonation. Very watery. Interesting balance of flavors between the light acidity and phenols. Phenols persist through the middle and onto the finish, managing only to be softened by a touch of chalky black malt. No fruity esters, caramel, mocha, java, or chocolate to speak of. Finishes acridly malty and plasticy with a semi-redeeming smidge of peanut and seared malt. Lingers with raw malts and tongue-numbing acidity. This is a mediocre stout at best and maybe the farthest thing I�ve ever witnessed from an aspiring Imperial.
Back Road Christmas Ale 2003;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Stout - Imperial;Back Road Brewery;Interesting- pours opaque dark brown, but not syrupy, with a thin ring of light tan carbonation. Burnt roasted malts and dry chocolate aroma. Although thin-bodied, there is plenty of flavor to be tasted here. Dark fruits, sweet roasted malt, and an almost vinous character emanate from the murky depths. Alcohol evident in the flavor and on the tongue after the sip. Doesn't have the body of an Imperial Stout, although the malt profile reminds me of Old Rasputin. Thanks Mike (BBB63) for yet another new beer!
Back Road Christmas Ale 2003;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Stout - Imperial;Back Road Brewery;"Thanks Big Bad Bear. I like how this does not contain the word ""holiday"" in its title. Great aroma, balanced, but with big hops and dark malt. The flavor is no surprise after smelling it: again, big, bold hops and dark malt flavor, but wonderfully smooth and balanced. Very good stuff."
Back Road Christmas Ale 2003;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Stout - Imperial;Back Road Brewery;Aged woody smell. Color is dark brown. Flavor is sweet up front with a slightly alcoholic, slightly tart finish. Had this one at the Southern Ratebeer Gathering in Austin, TX on December 6, 2003.
Back Road Christmas Ale 2003;La Porte, Indiana, United States;Stout - Imperial;Back Road Brewery;Hmm, wouldnt have guessed Imp. Stout honestly. Reminded me alot of Old Jubilation, which is an English Strong. Ok though, Old Jubilation dosent have the roast and cofee flavors (and neither do ESAs). Anyhow, it had a very similar smooth, fruity yeast flavor that I love, lots of ripe medium tart cherries mixed with caramel malt. Big black opaque color and a lovely rich yellow/brown head and lots of lacing. Lots of french roast coffee. Medium body. Very well done. Not nearly as big and complex as some of the more popular Imperials, but this one is great for what it is, and I would have guessed about 6 ABV at the most. Thank you so much for the chance to sample this Mike (BBB63).
Ithaca Winterizer;Ithaca, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Ithaca Beer Co.;Multiple spices in the aroma. Brown in color with little head. Nutty, spicy, cinnamon flavor. Smooth and feel the alcohol a little.
Ithaca Winterizer;Ithaca, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Ithaca Beer Co.;Amber brown with off-white head. Nice spicy aroma with some cinnamon, nutmeg, and some malts. Medium bodied with some roasty notes and some hints of coffee that come out on the palate.
Ithaca Winterizer;Ithaca, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Ithaca Beer Co.;Dark and glassy reddish brown appearance. Head only lasts a minute but leaves a film on top. Spicy cinnamon-like aroma over a dark cherry. Ale taste is a slightly more saccharine cherry. Can�t tell if the balance will hold. Roasted malt coupled with a tart (too?-)sweet cherry/berry. Winter ale has that cinnamony spice which adds a dimension but doesn�t make it more desirable. At least it�s balanced. Watery but a little thick. A tiny bitter bite at the end. Not my bag. Too sweet for a beer. Beer should be a little bitter. Not stomach-churning (high praise, i know). Just not my thing.
Rogue Chris;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;"""another low-hop pale ale. better than 4 x 4, due to the crisp malty sweetness. otherwise, not a good example of an apa. Enjoyable enough beer, but fairly boring."""
Rogue Chris;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;I picked up the bottle at the Brewery in 2004. It had a cool label on it. I honestly don�t remember what the beer was like. But I have the bottle to prove that I had it. I remeber it being basic but still great.
Rogue Chris;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Pours with a nice deep gold coloring. The white head faded quickly. The aroma was honey and wheat maltiness. Flavor is very subtle and well balanced. The bread crust taste also has a hint of grapefruit. Very subtle and enjoyable. Thanks, Flipbrewer for the hook up.
Rogue Chris;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Nice citrusy hop aroma. Good hop bite throughout with a touch of malt for balance. Finishes to the drier side. Quite enjoyable.
Rogue Chris;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;A nice mellow, session pale ale. Very drinkable, very smooth. Tastes like a strong pilsener. I like it.
Rogue Chris;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Mild aroma slightly hoppy. Flavor is of hops and a raisiny malt backing which I found interesting, and quite liked.
Rogue Chris;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Lighter hop flavor than I expected from a Rouge beer. �Chris� had a our yeasty aftertaste, but enjoyable nonetheless. It would make a great session beer.
Rogue Chris;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Pours a dark golden color with a small white head and no lacing. Grassy and light citrus hop aroma. Also sweet malts are present in the aroma. A nice balance here, nothing over the top. Begins malty sweet and light bitterness throughout.
Rogue Chris;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;22 oz bottle thanks to Jeff (radiomgb). Pours a bottle conditioned (lots of sediment) hazy deep golden/yellow with a foamy white head flecked with yellow. Smells grassy, herbal and sweet, hints of lightly bitter yellow fruit (starfruit comes to mind, kiwi, touch of lemon). Hops are aromatic but not in your face. Flavor is malty sweet (angel food cake, cookie dough) with some late bitterness from the hops, though not too much of it. Wonderful flavor and the body is medium with a smooth almost creamy palate. Fairly crisp finish, but I would ask for a bit more hoppy bitterness, as it does stay quite malty and sweet.
Rogue Chris;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;apricot like hop aroma, golden hue, nutty and malty, nice earthy bitterness, light in body

Redstone Juniper Berry Mountain Honey Wine;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Mead - Metheglin/Spiced/Herbs;Redstone Meadery;This bottled Mead from a beer bar poured a head of bubbles that were and left behind a very softly carbonated transparent weak yellow colored body and no lacing. The mild aroma was fruity. The off-tasting mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a lingering fruity aftertaste. The strange flavor contained notes of honey and fruity. Not one that I would likely drink again.
Redstone Juniper Berry Mountain Honey Wine;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Mead - Metheglin/Spiced/Herbs;Redstone Meadery;Sampled at the Manitou Wine Festival.

Taste is sweet with notes of fruity lemon, apricot, some mango, with a touch of spice, bready notes, finishing sweet. Not bad, wish it dried out a bit more and was a bit one-dimensional.

Pumphouse Mango/Peach Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Had this at the brewery. Beer pours a murky, light-yellow color with a small, creamy, white, mostly and quickly diminishing head. The aroma is a little faint with moderate notes of resin/pine, a trace yeast note of dough and tons of trace miscellaneous notes which included peach, vanilla, honey and pineapple. The flavor was moderately sweet and lightly bitter with a short, balanced, rather bland and unclean-tasting finish. The body was light, the texture was watery and the carbonation was lively.

Pumphouse Mango/Peach Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;"Hazy and light yellow with a frothy white head. Soft, tingly carbonation. Light-tasting, earthy malts. Extremely sweet mango flavors up front, with some fruity mango aromas near the finish. Strange, ""wet wood"" / yeasty notes throughout, almost like stinky cheese in a way. Not necessarily bad, but odd. Very mild bitterness and a hint of tartness in the finish."
Pumphouse Strike Team Stout;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Stout;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draft at brewpub. Pours black with a khaki head that disappears quickly. Some roasted notes on the nose. Some bitterness on the finish which follows some coffee notes on the tongue.

Aroma is heavy malt (chocolate, coffee, toasted), light hops (woody), light esters (fruity) with notes of wood and charcoal. Flavor is heavy malt (chocolate, coffee, toffee), light hops (woody), light esters (fruity) with notes of prune and charcoal. Full body, low warmth, medium carbonation and creaminess with a sweet texture and dry finish.
Pumphouse Strike Team Stout;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Stout;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Tap at the brewpub - this one was quite nice - nice, smooth mouthfeel - good balance of sweetness, roast, and bitterness - along with the expected chocolate, coffee, and vanilla, there is a welcome dose of anise - hefty despite its low abv.
Pumphouse Strike Team Stout;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Stout;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Had this on-tap at the brewery. This beer poured a very dark, warm brown color�nearly opaque. The nitro-fueled head was off-white, thick and lasting and left behind nice lacing on the glass. The aroma was thick with dark coffee, chocolate, toasted grain, peat and a trace of smoke. The flavor was initially moderately sweet with a long-lasting moderately bitter finish. The body was medium-to-thick, the texture was lux and velvety, the beer was softly carbonated.

Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, caramel, chocolate), with a note of smoke. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. Pretty good for nitro, at least with regards to the aroma. Flavor and mouthfeel are the usual disappointments though.
Pumphouse Strike Team Stout;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Stout;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Nitro - pretty good however it tasted pretty much like the nitro Imperial that I had here. The nitro smooths the beer out but seems to make the flavor one-dimensional. Most stouts on nitro taste about the same to me, so it is hard to rate them.
Pumphouse Strike Team Stout;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Stout;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Almost black, with a bit of red and brown colors appearing at the glass edge.

Soft and creamy texture accented by a sharp roastiness. Some burnt notes and a hint of sourness. Hints of black coffee and bitter, dark chocolate. Rather bitter finish (grass and a little citrus), with only a mild sweetness to complement. Tasted much better the second time. RERATE, NITRO: Black pearl hue; lasting tan head (typical nitro appearance). Very roasty and toasty. Coffee was definitely evident. Some dark chocolate. Nice level of sweetness (i.e., not too much of it). Bit of lactic sourness. Decent stout."

Barrington Mankin's Organic English Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Reviewed from notes. Bottle to English pint glass. The appearance was a golden bronzed copper color with a finger�s worth of white foamy head that fell off at a decent pace. Mild messy lace. The aroma had some sweet biscuits/clean cereal sweet grains, some grassy hops, light earthiness, touch of floral and a little bit of woodiness. The flavor had the normal malty dryness of an English pale ale coming across clean without diacetyl. Aftertaste was clean biscuits and grassy hops. Finish was the same. The palate was between light and medium bodied with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt fine. Overall, pretty good as an English pale ale. Probably should have had on tap at the brewpub with some of their fish n� chips

Barrington Mankin's Organic English Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Bottle that I kept for too long. Whoops. Pours a lightly hazed gold with a large white head. Soft malt, definite age and possibly some infection. Not necessarily infected, but there�s something weird going on. Carbonation is huge, old paper and malt. Slight bitterness on the finish. Apple and vegetal notes. Dumped the bulk of this.

Barrington Mankin's Organic English Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;22 oz bottle. Pours a lightly hazy golden amber with a smaller bubbly white head. Aroma of corn, cream corn, stale malt extract...and maybe some floral notes.

Barrington Mankin's Organic English Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Nice EPA. Sampled on draught from brewpub. Very authentic mild hop aroma and taste to this EPA. Palate is nicely crisp yet with a subtle follow-through, reminding you of a Fullers, just with something missing -- probably overcarbonated. Slightly less bitter than the ESB.

Archers City of Truro;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);I have checked my notes and I definitely drank this beer at the Cross Hands, Winterbourne Down, S Gloucs in October 2006. This was served in excellent condition with an amber colour and slight white head. The aroma was slightly toffeeish with some supporting hops. It was very easy drinking with a malty caramel flavour and smooth, dry finish. Very good - I had several pints of it.

Mishawaka Anniversary Porter;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Porter;Mishawaka Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. This brew was poured ice cold for BBB63 and I at the brewery. It had a small head of foamy light brown extremely long lasting bubbles that left behind an excellent lace and a opaque dark brown colored body with no visible carbonation. It had a nice dark malt aroma that may have been more comples as it warmed, but I was in too much of a hurry and guzzled it down too fast to tell. The mouthfeel was smooth with a mild tingle in the finish. It had a mild malt flavor that was very disappointing given the wonderful appearance of the brew.
Mishawaka Anniversary Porter;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Porter;Mishawaka Brewing Company;"RERATE 2005 batch, growler: An increase in appearance, quite the nice lacing. While the nose is a bit weak, there is enough there to keep me interested. Again, the flavor is twangy and displays a some burnt character, quite quaffable. The recipe is the same but the ability to enjoy slower at home made me feel better about the beer as a whole. On tap: Dark brown hue with a good frothy light brown head and good lace. Aroma hinted of dark bread, cereal, nutty malts, milk chocolate, smoke, and vanilla. A bit weak in the nose. The taste was bitter with a undertone of nut and some sweetness. The dry finish had a twangy and smoky character with hoppy presense. Not really deep or complex, served way too cold. Body was too thin but was lively. A average porter, not what I expected from someones ""anniversary"" brew. Disappointing. (2.8 original score)"

Sequoia Imperial Stout;Fresno, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sequoia Brewing Company;Draft at brewery. Aroma of roasted malt, bitter hops and burnt coffee. Pours black with a dark brown head. Flavor is roasted malt, dark coffee, nuts and alcohol. Huge thick mouthfeel and some alcohol burn in the finish. Quite bitter and dry all of the way through. I asked the barkeep whether there were any plans to age some of this and he said no. He said it was about five months old. Too bad cause I�d like to try this after a year or or two.
Sequoia Imperial Stout;Fresno, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sequoia Brewing Company;"Yum, on tap in Tower. Shared with my girl Amber who hated every drop of it. What else is new? Poured blacker than night with a nice quarter inch of tan head. This is the 2008 10%abv version. Nose is alcohol and malt. Taste has both hints of coffee and chocolate, with subtle alcohol hints through out. Really easy drinking and probably the best brew from sequoia so far. Going back for more this weekend. Funny sign on the wall as you walk in though it read: ""Russian Imperial Stout has a two pint limit..."" I wonder why?"

Mishawaka Jack O Lager Pumpkin Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Mishawaka Brewing Company;Hazed amber/orange, minimal head. Strong nutmeg and cinnamon nose. Festive aroma, but Whoa! Way too frickin� sweet! Spices are detectable in the flavor but far behind the sugar cloy. Mid-bodied and mouth coating. Not recommended. (However, I took a suggestion from our server and mixed this about 1:2 with Mishawaka�s Founder�s Stout. It was interesting and it balanced out the sweetness, but I�d just as well bypass the Pumpkin and have a pint of the stout.)

Mishawaka Jack O Lager Pumpkin Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Mishawaka Brewing Company;"Bottle (I am assuming that this is the beer I drank - was in a bottle labelled ""Specialty Beer"" with a cartoon pumpkin sticker on it).

Small white head with sparse lacing, minimal carbonation and a pale yellow hue. Nose was a lot of pumpkin, spicy, clove, and nutmeg. Flavor was pumpkin, spicy, somewhat acidic and the flavor of pumpkin really stood out in the flavor. Almost too much IMO. Tingly mouthfeel. Light body. Somewhat over-the-top pumpkin tasting.

The aroma has notes of nutmeg, coriander, clove, apple butter, apricot, grassy hops, and a hint of vegetable (the pumpkin I believe).

Mishawaka Beer Garden Ale;Elkhart, Indiana, United States;IPA;Mishawaka Brewing Company;From a bottle and served in my NB worthy glass: Clean deep brown hue with a small but lasting frothy head and left some lace. The aroma is juicy and fruity hops, light pepper, honey, and bready sweet malts. The taste starts with a twangy lemon and grapefruit overtone followed by some piney and herbal notes.

Actually for the style it is fairly average, but given the style that doesn�t say it is worth drinking. A real flat raunchy fruity flavor. Kind of has a bad iced tea thing going on
OGriffs India Pale Ale;Quincy, Illinois, United States;IPA;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Draft at O�Griff�s. Who knows how old this was. Pours a near-amber with an offwhite head. Nose has some caramel noted along with toast and generic C-hops. Centennial? On tasting, medium bitterness, caramel and c-hop flavor. Fruity hops. Clean overall. Dry finish. Not my style of IPA but okay.
OGriffs India Pale Ale;Quincy, Illinois, United States;IPA;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;IPAs are not one of my favorite styles of beer. So any rating I give one should probably be upgraded somewhat. This one did not look like an IPA. I even asked the bartender to make sure it was correct. Very dark for an IPA. This beer was primarily dry bitterness with a hint of tartness.
OGriffs India Pale Ale;Quincy, Illinois, United States;IPA;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Pretty dark for a IPA. It had a hoppy smell but, the taste wasn�t as hoppy. Didn�t have a big bitter taste but, still had the piney taste. Not a fan of IPA and I enjoyed this one.
OGriffs Haleigh's Honey Brown;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Light brown brown with a khaki head. Nose is sweet caramel, honey, dough, bread and more honey. Easy palate, caramel malts up front, backed with toffee, honey and bread.
OGriffs Haleigh's Honey Brown;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Draft at O�Griff�s. This was one of the better beers here. Pours a deep brown/amber with an offwhite head. Nose is toasty and nutty, faint honey notes.Clean. on tasting, nutty with a light sweetness. Spicy honey and toasty malts. Some black malt ashyness on the finish. Really solid. stuff.
OGriffs Haleigh's Honey Brown;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;I usually like these types of beers, this one has a good color, nice head. It just had a funky taste, I was not impressed. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
OGriffs Haleigh's Honey Brown;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Pint served on draft at the brewpub in a big plastic cup &#40Quincy, IL&#41. Pours a dark rusty brown, moreso on the edges, hazy, decent offwhite head that dies to a film and laces lightly. Aromas are lightly sweet, a touch of honey and caramel malts, grainy cereal quality. A bit one dimensional. Initial is sweet, caramel malts, raisin, honey, and a bit of vanilla. Faint bittering, as the malt really takes over as a whole. Light sweetness is nice, a good sessioner if the ABV wasn�t as high, which I guess lends to some residual sugars. Light on the palate, leaving a sweet typed coating. Cereal, almost cheerios. Ok. A bit underwhelming overall.
OGriffs Haleigh's Honey Brown;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;On tap as Haleigh�s Honey Brown. The body was deep copper brown with a khaki head. The aroma was strong with caramel and apples. There was also a leathery note along with a little soap. The taste was lightly sour at first with a sweet note as I went along. There was some leather and peaches. Woody along with and ashy, light honey finish. Strange.
OGriffs Haleigh's Honey Brown;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Darker color but, not really a brown color. Next to no head for a beer that usually has at least some. Don�t remember there being much to smell. Somewhat sweet taste but, not as much as normal. I really wonder if they gave me the right beer.
OGriffs Muddy Mississippi Oatmeal Stout;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Draft at O�Griff�s.

OGriffs Muddy Mississippi Oatmeal Stout;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Tap at the brewpub, called Muddy Mississippi Oatmeal Stout. The body is black with no head. The aroma has some milk chocolate with some woody notes. The taste has some milk chocolate with some dryy woody notes. There was also some tobacco in the dry finish. Solid.
OGriffs Muddy Mississippi Oatmeal Stout;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;"From the tap, served in a standard pint glass. Made a decent appearance, poured an opaque dark coffee brown with a small foamy head that settled into a thin, slightly bubbly lacing, moderate carbonation overall. Had a sweet roasted malty nose, coffee, fruity and oatmeal sweet. A crisp, smooth medium bodied mouth feel, above average drinkability. Sweet roasted malty taste, coffee and fruity, a nice alcohol warmth shows up in the middle, the sweetness has almost a soda syrupy-like quality, some toffeeness towards the end and a dry-ish sweet roasted malt finish. A good oatmeal stout, tasty and quaffable, worth ordering. Also at the brewpub this is called ""Muddy Mississippi Oatmeal Stout."""
OGriffs Muddy Mississippi Oatmeal Stout;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Nice and dark with whitish head. Slight coffee smell but, not enough to make me stop drinking it. Everything that makes a stout was there but, everything was light. Again, not a huge fan of stouts but, I enjoyed this one.
OGriffs Winter Street Strawberry Ale;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Draft at O�Griff�s. Pours a very bright pale straw with a thin white head. Nose is artificial strawberry flavoring. Vanilla cream and faint pils malt. On tasting, artificial strawberries and cream.

OGriffs Winter Street Strawberry Ale;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;I did the sampler at O�griff�s and this was one of them. To me it was like drinking watery strawberry jam. Won�t have it again ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
OGriffs Winter Street Strawberry Ale;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Pint served on draft at the brewpub in a big plastic cup &#40Quincy, IL&#41. Pours a reddish amber with small white head that clings to the corners, films, laces lightly. Aromas are sweet strawberry candies, a touch syrupy and sugary, hiding much else overall. Ok, I guess. Initial is light, cereal malts covered up by some decent strawberry sweetness, a bit sugary overall, as grainy and cereal aftertaste stick through, linger with a touch of sweetness and lighter strawberry. The strawberry flavor isn�t bad, I just think it is a tad artificial overall. Finish is grainy, sweet, forgettable. A panty dropper for sure, though. Cheers.
OGriffs Winter Street Strawberry Ale;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;An ale by appearance, this beer had a sweet aroma but it was definitely not ovepowering. Strawberry flavors were expected but were not that evident, just a hint, really. A pleasant beer for a fruit beer.
OGriffs Winter Street Strawberry Ale;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Strawberry smell which wasn�t too shocking. Slight wheat flavor with nice strawberry taste that takes over but, doesn�t kill everything. This is one of the first flavored beers where the fruit didn�t taste flat. Good overall but, I would have liked it a bit stronger.
OGriffs Riverboat Porter;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Porter;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Draft at O�Griff�s. Pours a deep brown-black. Tan head. Nose is light caramel and cocoa, char and some faint hops. On tasting, medium bodied. Char and roast flavor with a good level of hop flavor. Moderately high bitterness through the finish and dry.
OGriffs Riverboat Porter;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Porter;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;On Tap pours black with a beige head. Aroma of roasted malt and coffee. Taste was of the coffee upfront and a malt finish.
OGriffs Riverboat Porter;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Porter;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;Pint served on draft at the brewpub in a big plastic cup &#40Quincy, IL&#41. Pours a dark brown, not opaque, but dark, a good sized offwhite head that dies to a soapy film and laces ok enough. Aromas are caramel, toffee, light roasted malts with faint coffee and chocolate. The aromas are quite light. Lighter bodied, but with good dose of dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts with light bitterness. Not sweet, but roasty and bitter stick to the palate, with a light creaminess, smooth overall. Roasted coffee sticks to the palate in the finish, but nothing over the top. A good solid sessionable porter, aside from the 6%. My favorite beer from here thus far.
OGriffs Riverboat Porter;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Porter;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;On tap at the brewpub, called River Boat Porter. The body was black with a khaki head. The aroma was lightly roasted coffee with some baking chocolate. The taste was roasted coffee with some mocha. This had a lightly nutty finish.
OGriffs Riverboat Porter;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Porter;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;At the brewpub, this is called the Riverboat Porter. From the tap, served in a pint glass. Poured a dark cola brown with a thin foamy tan head, settled into a fine lacing, no sticking. Too faint a nose for a porter, light scents of cocoa powder mix, toffee, a sweet fruitiness, lacking any caramel or coffee malt aromas, unimpressive. Thin and watery tasting, medium-light bodied, dry, but light on any malty crispness, the malts are way too thin for a porter, watery cocoa and coffee beans, and I do mean watery, like if you dropped some beans in a cool glass of water and then drank it, not very appealing, a subtle, but again, watery sweet fruitiness, even for a below average porter, the hops are completely tasteless, no presence at all, a dry, watery coffee malt finish, this disappointing, barely drinkable. I had the Riverboat Porter last fall (2006) and it was so much better than this. O�Griff�s hired a new brewmaster in the beginning of the summer and I am praying this just an oddball batch, not one of his brews. I will try this again in the late summer or early fall and re-review if necessary. A porter this bad could kill off a brewpub.
OGriffs Riverboat Porter;Quincy, Illinois, United States;Porter;OGriffs Irish Pub, Grill and Brew House;This beer was very smooth and quite mild. Plenty of malts are evident as is some light coffee and toffee, as well. A nice drinkable beer.

Golden in colour with rising bubbles. Aromas are sticky apples with not much alcohol evident. Flavours are sweet apple, quite syrupy followed by a chemical aftertaste.

Northwoods Mouthy Muskie Light Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Bottled. Light straw yellow with a white topper that fades away rapidly into a thin layer. Aroma is sweet and grainy with mild lemon and corn. Body is thin and highly carbonated. Malt, metal and corn make up the bulk of the flavors and it finishes metallic and off. I pretty much knew what I was getting into this one.
Northwoods Mouthy Muskie Light Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Pint. When I asked the waitress how the Muskie was, she said it tasted like Miller. I new then it wasn�t going to be that great. Light gold, high carbonation, no head. Aroma was a bit musky. Flavor and body was very light, but a little hint of citrus. It went down like water, so not bad on a very hot and humid day in Wisconsin.
Northwoods Mouthy Muskie Light Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;I�m not sure what to say about this beer. I know how i feel about it. But i don�t think im that far off when i saw it tasted like someone just threw a handful of grain in some water and kegged it. That�s really the best way for me to describe it. tasteless in every aspect.
Northwoods Mouthy Muskie Light Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Tap at the brewpub. Light yellow pour with a thin white head.

Northwoods Mouthy Muskie Light Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;"Appearance: Pours a cloudy, pale gold body with a small white head. Smell: Odd, distressing aroma of rotten lemons and perhaps corn. Taste: An equally odd, but even more distressing flavor of abandoned citrus fruits and musty corn. Good grief.

Northwoods Mouthy Muskie Light Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;12oz bottle from brewpub: Pours a transparent golden bronze with a thin, wispy-lacing white head. Aroma of lightly sweet, pale grainy malt and a hint of metallic notes and noble hops. Body starts thin and watery with a strange raspberry seed tartness and fizzy carbonation toward candy-like tart finish. Very weird, but if you called it a raspberry ale, I�d probably have rated it higher.
Northwoods Mouthy Muskie Light Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Northwoods Brew Pub;Picked up single 12-oz bottle from brewpub. Pours a light golden straw brew with a thin off white film and a light white ring. Aroma of sweet popcorn, some flowery hops, and a touch of apple.

Wychwood Tight Head;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cask Handpump at the Beer House, Manchester 29/10/2003 Amber mid brown coloured with some sour fruit aroma. Slightly dry malt finish.
Wychwood Tight Head;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cask Conditioned at The White Hart, Minster Lovell, Oxon. A brown beer with little head. Brewed, not to prove the brewers skill at creating a perfect head on the beer, but to catch the current Rugby World Cup fever, a Tight Head is a position in the scrum. The beer has an acidic background, a fermented grain nose and is quite thin on the palate, not very good at all, unlike England who are in the final on Saturday. All together, 'Swing Low Sweet Chariot'

The aroma offers up a mix of spicy to grassy to a touch lime like hoppiness with mild grainy malt notes and a sliver or two of almond nuttiness underneath. The taste hits first with a pleasing spicy to grassy to a bit floral hoppiness across the palate where there�s a good dose of both bittering hops and flavoring hoppiness. To midway mild sugar malt notes are noticed that roll into a slightly grainy malt to nutty sensation but overall this remains firmly hoppy from front to back. Nice hoppy flavor where the flat sense of the zwickel body is right there into the finish. Nice zwickeled pils. I like it. I wish in the summer there were more Zwickels around to try.

I loved the Anchor and was excited to try my second Dunkler Bock now. Well, this sucked. I expected it to have a fair amount of chocolate in it with some other nice notes but not so. It was very malty. Lots of blood/iron taste to it and very boring. A bland beer.

Aroma of citrus, sweet malt and lots of caramel. Taste of citrus, sweet malt and mild hops. Light palate that�s a bit vegetal.

Millstream Warsh Pail Ale;Amana, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Millstream Brewing Company;Bottled. Poured just slightly hazy medium orange with a short, sticky, well-retained cap of beige head. The aroma picked up grapefruit, caramel, and fresh pine with a lovely balance to it.. quite fragrant and enticing. The flavor wasn�t far off.. caramel and grapefruit meat join up with a pinch of honey at the core.. light-to-moderate bitterness from pine, earth, and grapefruit.. sweet fruity finish stamped with pine bitters. Medium-bodied with rising bitterness toward the back of the palate.. a little rough on the finish with a dry and bitter feel.. otherwise flowed well.

Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with flavors of dry caramel malt, citrus and piney hops with a slight fruity background. Finish is slightly dry and bitter with a fruit aftertaste. Nice touch.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Taste: mellow caramel malt, crisp but not much hop character. Mild grain nose. Gild, clear, with a foamy head and some lace on taster glass. Lite body. Does not live up to what it says on the can.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Sampled from a 12 oz can this beer poured a bright yellow color with a huge creamy white head that lingered and left decent lacing. The aroma was sweet, tangy,citric, grassy and perfumey. The flavor is tangy and a bit sour with grass and perfume notes. Short finish. Light body.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);hey, whatta ya want for �bout 43 cents a can full, anyway? bought the 30 canner down the street and the clerk said it tasted too sweet for her. but, what the heck, life�s too short to just drink craft brew, too, ya know. (and oft�times too damn expensive, too......)
Milwaukee Special Reserve Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);From a 12 fl. oz. can stamped 0832-1935. It pours straw yellow with a huge pale lager white fizzy head. Aroma is thin but it does have some veiled malts, corn, rice, and a low hop crispness typical for this style. The body is light. The taste is reasonably well-balanced for what it is with grainy malts and a clean, hop ending. It is average for the style so I give it an average rating.
Milwaukee Special Reserve Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Milwaukee Special Reserve has a very thick, quickly-dissipating white head and a clear, somewhat bubbly, golden appearance. There is some slight lacing left on the glass. The aroma is of sickly-sweet, wet grain husks and green apples. Taste is of sweet grain, husks, and green apple flavored Jolly Roger candy. The mouthfeel is light and watery, and Milwaukee Special Reserve finishes mostly dry and unpleasant. Overall, this is a cheap, private label, unappealing beer. RJT
Milwaukee Special Reserve Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);WARM 30 PACK FOR $8.99!!! Of course it got its ass purchased. Undoubtedly the worst �beer� I�ve ever had that didn�t say �malt liquor� on the bottle. Stunningly bad. Lost Lake, American, Gennesse, Golden Anniversary, and Clear Creek Ice are all better tasting than this. But then again, it is $8.99 for a thirty pack and I can see this getting destroyed on a rowdy summer night right around the time the liquor stores close. Being aware of this beer wins you a few street points for sure.

Small smooth beige head that fully diminished, splotchy lacing, carbonation observed, mostly transparent with a slight haziness, and a reddish orange hue. The nose was malty, caramel, hoppy, and ditto for the flavor with the ABV coming through. Tingly mouthfeel and medium in body. Quaffable, definite hop and ABV presence but not overly done.
Clipper City Heavy Seas Winter Storm DIPA (2003-2004);Baltimore, Maryland, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Picked up a 12 oz bottle from a �make your six pack� cart. Not too bad but their clever little month and year �notch-able� strip doesn�t do much good if no one actually notches it. This beer is retired according to ratebeer so god knows how old this bottle is. I�m not sure why it rates so high. The �dry hopping� the brewer brags about in the description DOES give it a more pleasent aroma but, in the end, it�s the same hoppy, bitter taste you find in similar pale ales. Either you like this style or you don�t. I don�t.
Clipper City Heavy Seas Winter Storm DIPA (2003-2004);Baltimore, Maryland, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;(bottle - 12 oz) Clear amber color with a thin white head. Aroma is very hoppy with some sweet malts. Mostly hops. Flavor is very hoppy and resiny with a nice bitter flavor throughout. Flavor leaves a nice and lingering bitterness. One awesome beer that I wish wouldn�t have been retired.

Aroma is apple, citrus hops, some caramel malts--mild and sweet. Body is medium-light with a surprising amount of foamy carbonation (lots) and a dry, astringent finish. Flavor is lightly sweet, apple, caramel, and a surprising amount of hops on the tart finish, flavor of grapefruit rind pith in the hops with some other citrus notes.

Jack Russell Harvest Apple Ale;Camino, California, United States;Radler / Shandy;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Sampled on 4/6/2009. This fruit beer pours a slightly cloudy medium orange gold color from a 112oz bottle. Small sized white foamy head. The aroma is apple ciderish, malty and spicy. A medium to light bodied fruit beer. The malts are fruity and sweet. Mostly apple cider and spices. Hops are very mild, maybe earthy. Kind of a cross between an amber ale and apple cider. Not sure if it really works. Apple flavors are semi-sweet. Decent carbonation. Nice balance. Worth trying, but not really my cup of tea. It needs a little more tartness in the apples and some citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet.

The crappy pic shown of the can is a perfect picture of the quality of this garbage.
Mountain Crest Classic Pilsner;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Minhas Craft Brewery;Very, very cheap tasting, but next to a can of the Mountain Creek Lager, this is slightly more desirable. Something like dishsoap masquerading as hops would technically make this a pilsner. Had it ice-cold in a frosted glass and it was drinkable, so I didn�t feel ripped off.
Mountain Crest Classic Pilsner;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Minhas Craft Brewery;"Sour doughey aroma. Very pale yellow with a white head and decent retention. Tastes terrible. Sour and cheap. I would not drink it if it was free. I once had the remains of an abandonded 12 pack in my fridge and it was ignored soo long (months) eventually it bacame a part of the fridge. People would ask ""hey Cole got any beer?"" and I would lookmin the fridge and say ""No I�m all out."" even though there was still crest in the fridge."
Mountain Crest Classic Pilsner;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Minhas Craft Brewery;Can from Pat�s. Gold (solidly deeper gold than many pale lagers) with white head. Nose is pale malt, honey, mild hops. Tastes of pale malt and some sweetness plus backup hops. Not terrible for the price, but probably not worth the time for most.
Mountain Crest Classic Pilsner;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Minhas Craft Brewery;Light, pale color, pours up with a thin, fizzy head. Aroma is very low key with light malt and some corn. There is a slight metallic aroma that wants to come out. This is a bit distracting. Flavor is fairly thin and bland with a bit of malt sweetness and very little hop balance. Finishes cloyingly sweet.
Gulf Islands Mayne Sail Ale;Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Gulf Islands Brewery (Salt Spring Island Ales);Better on tap than from the bottle, but still quite acceptable in either format. Pours a nice, clear gold with an average white head that leaves little lacing. Aroma gives up both some hop and some malt, as does the taste. A nice refreshing beer.
Gulf Islands Mayne Sail Ale;Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Gulf Islands Brewery (Salt Spring Island Ales);Hazy light brown, creamy tan head.Lightly fruity floral malt nose.Lightly fruity malt profile with mild,medium length hop finish.
Gulf Islands Mayne Sail Ale;Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Gulf Islands Brewery (Salt Spring Island Ales);On tap at Moby�s on Salt Spring Island. Hazy amber colour with a thick, fluffy off-white head. Sweet caramel malt, some medium crystal malt and an orange citrus aroma. Flavour is fairly sweet, caramel malt with a nice toasted malt flavour and a citrusy hop finish. Light resiny flavour as well. Tasty brew.
Town Hall Chubby Monk;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;This is my second sampling of this new Town Hall brew, one pint had at the pub earlier today and this new taste comes from a growler, well warmed. I'm pouring it out into a favorite Belgian dubbel glass, and we see a clear, dark chestnut brown brew emerging in the vessel, topped with a fair and fizzy head, though woefully short-lived. Aroma: bold and complex, taking some time to show itself, tossing out notes of nuts, chocolate, dark fruit, brandy, red wine, full of richness and dark delights. As for taste, a good texture and prodigious mouthfeel, snappy hops at first, but dominated by malt, with the flavor getting ever fruitier on the palate. The flavor projects more with every tilt of the glass and gulp of the brew, while a tiny tartness emerges to check up on the sweetness. Rich, delicious, warm, nutty, with a continual tang on the tongue. Finish is just right, medium length, and lingering well past when the liquid leaves the mouth. As I get further into it, I like this dubbel more and more, and what's not to like? Ample body, excellent taste, well-rounded flavor, and a lovely, lively kick to boot. I'll be returning for more of this Brother Monk, you can be sure.
Town Hall Chubby Monk;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Cask, (dubbel on cask? wtf?) Lightly estery, with a good dark sweet malt character. Quite ""dubbely"" if I will. Good special B character, touch of liquorice. Quite sweet, but nice rich malt character. Good interpretation of a dubbel."
Town Hall Chubby Monk;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Clear, red. No head. Fruit aroma. Taste is also of fruit with salt. Reminded me of Duinen.
Town Hall Chubby Monk;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;great muhfuggin' dubbel. mahogany in color. no head at all. perfect consistency on my tongue. definitely true to the style. nice fruity maltiness type thang goin' on in my mouf. like roasted plums (do people ever roast plums?). sweet finish, smooth palate. i might even drink this if it didn't have any alcohol in it. i hope town hall never runs out.
Town Hall Chubby Monk;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;It should be noted that I am not too familiar with this style. That said, I enjoyed this beer. The smell was fresh grapes over the very present carbonation. I tasted it immediately and the cold serving temp hindered what I knew to be lurking beneath. I waited a while, even stirred it with a knife to remove the excess carbonation, then things got interesting. Bananas and slight clove on the tongue with a hint of what grape juice smells like. The respectable ABV was hidden nicely due to the aging. As a cask fanatic, I will have to wait and see if they offer it from the pump. I will re-rate then. But I did enjoy this beer!

Pinnacle Peak Gunslinger Imperial Stout;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse;Draft @ Pinnacle. Black with a thick, tan head. Aroma of bitter roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. Flavor is bitter-sweet chocolate, coffee and black malt. Fullish body with average carbonation. Really nice Imperial Stout, way better than I expected.
Pinnacle Peak Gunslinger Imperial Stout;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse;Tap. Nearly black with a chocolate milk colored head. Aroma has lots of chocolate, roasted malt and molasses. Flavor is chocolatey sweet with some tar, roasted malt and espresso. Good.
Pinnacle Peak Gunslinger Imperial Stout;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse;"Draught at the brewpub, came simply as Stout Black color; creamy head. A Stout with a good body and mouthfeel, the aroma is quite simple, the flavor strangely is a bit dusty; balanced mix of caramel, chocolate and roasted malts; correct bitterness; very light sourness that is maybe a bit out of place. Not bad, but less interesting than their Pale Ales."
Pinnacle Peak Gunslinger Imperial Stout;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse;Draft at the brewpub. Opaque black color with a tan head. Light molasses and vanilla aroma. Full bodied and a bit sticky on the tongue. Less roasty than the porter with vanilla, light soy sauce, and chocolate flavors.
Pinnacle Peak Gunslinger Imperial Stout;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse;Tap @ Steakhouse. Medium roasty aroma with some alcohol. Black body with good tan head and some lacing. Flavor had some creamy texture to it but mainly just a meadium bodied roasty and alocohol. Not overpowering brew but I wish I could of said dam that was good.
Pinnacle Peak Gunslinger Imperial Stout;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse;Sampler@the Steakhouse: Color is pure black with a light tan head. Aroma is caramel with a hint of licorice. Flavor starts dark chocolate with a hint of licorice then some mocha. Medium body, creamy texture with soft carbonation.
Pinnacle Peak Gunslinger Imperial Stout;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse;Draft: Black with maple hints. Sandy-bubbled tan head. Potting soil and caramel comprise the aroma. Heavy swirls release roast, prunes, and dark berries. Airy carbonation with a fuzzy tickle. Harshly grainy. Overt meaty maltiness and alcohol greet the palate while trace caramel and mocha temporarily relieve the tongue from the nauseating sweetness. Black malt char exerts a strong earthiness, yet with little else to back it up. Soured dark grape acidity displaces the salvageable malt flavors and clashes with subtler notes of spent motor oil and shoe polish. Hint of mocha emerges from the burnt malt hulls, which also bolster the dryness. Cloying finish exhibits a disorderly mess of oversweet, soggy plums and harsh acidity. Phenolic belches ensue. Okay aroma, but it�s all downhill, thereafter. Pretty disastrous attempt.
Pinnacle Peak Winter Porter;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Porter;Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse;on tap @ the steak house...dark brown almost black color. one of the darkest i�ve seen. little aroma as it was served way too cold. i did manage to pull out dark roasted malts, a bit of nuttiness and earth when it warmed a bit. flavor is very dark malt, cola and a little bit of coffee. a strange acidic hint creeps in with the burnt finish. medium bodied. if this had tasted as aggressive as it looked...would have been a �5�...
Pinnacle Peak Winter Porter;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Porter;Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse;Draft at the brewpub. Opaque black with a tan head that laced the glass. Chocolate aroma. Roasty, chocolate/coffee flavor. Body was on the light side of the spectrum.
Pinnacle Peak Winter Porter;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Porter;Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse;Sample @ Steakhouse. Black body with nice tan head. The aroma had a stale coco to it. Flavor of a rich chocolate was trying to get my attention here but just watered down dry chocolate is what I got.
Pinnacle Peak Winter Porter;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Porter;Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse;Sampler@the Steakhouse: Color is black with a small tan head. Light sweet coffee and cream aroma. Flavor starts with a little dark chocolate followed by a light coffee bitter finish. Medium bodied, smooth and creamy with mild carbonation.
Pinnacle Peak Winter Porter;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Porter;Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse;Now owned by Sonora Brewing of Pheonix, AZ. Winter Porter is of course, their seasonal brew, and it is a delicious, sweet, and tasty brown porter, that was the perfect brew to sip and relax with before, during, and after a meal at Pinnacle Peak. It is spiced with a touch of nutmeg and cinnamon, but what really impressed me about this beer, was the wonderful mild coffee and dark chocolate flavors that made it just so delicious and drinkable. PP Patio Winter Porter pours to a beautiful, deep brown to ebony color with a thick, creamy tan head, and a soft to moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic with lots of mild coffee and dark chocolate aromas paired with just a hint of cinnamon spice. The palate is full and soft on the tongue with lots of mild roasty flavors along with some sweet malty and creamy dark chocolate flavors. PP Patio Porter finishes with more mild roast up front then ends with a slightly sweet dark chocolate and spice flavors that linger.
Piraux Nounou;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;(Bottle 25 cl) Golden, slightly hazy beer with a nice, frothy head. Nose of malt and alcohol. Flavours of yeast and alcohol - and some malt. But really a very unspectacular strong ale. I believe this is another Bios/ Van Steenberge brew. 190999
Piraux Nounou;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"Blond color.

Altes Tramdepot Rauchbier;Bern, Switzerland;Smoked - Rauchbier;Altes Tramdepot;Draft at the bewpub. It seems like they don�t brew this beer so often! Murky brown pour with a very frothy long-lived head and some broken lacing. Smoky aroma with citrus notes. Smooth, bitter, slightly sour flavour with some smoke, that, along with a hint of dryness, sits for a while on the palate. A drinkable beer, not too smoky and quite refreshing, but nothing special.
Altes Tramdepot Rauchbier;Bern, Switzerland;Smoked - Rauchbier;Altes Tramdepot;clear amber colour, fine dense head and a nice lace, light smokey aroma with notes of sausage, thin to medium body, soapy mouthfeel, sweet, no bitterness, the finish is rather flat with a hint of retronasal smokiness
Cidre Dupont R�serve;Victot-Pontfol, France;Apple Cider;Domaine Famille Dupont;Bottle shared on final holiday evening of our little tour-de-France through Mont-M�dy (Ardennes), Piriac-sur-Mer (Bretagne) and Les Moutiers-en-Cinglais (Normandie). Bottle bought at the domaine, where I sampled it before. Pours clear golden with some rust in the color. Rich sweet apples, caramel, cinnamon, tangerine, a light tart edge leaning in against the sweetness, softening vanilla of the oak barrels, soft nutty tannins, and warming whisky-like fumes of the calvados come through. Sweet and moderate bitter, tart edges. Over medium body and fine carbonation. The cider has a somewhat fatter body than most, sticks to the glass like a good wine or olive oil and one can almost chew and crunch the crystallised sugars in this light syrupy apple juice. Complex, delicate and delicious. A beautiful product for sure, but it won�t cure me of my weak spot for barnyard funky ciders.

A very elegant cider, perhaps not as dry as I was expecting but it doesn't really limit its drinkability.

Manoir d'Apreval Cuv�e Saint-Georges;Honfleur, France;Apple Cider;Manoir d'Apreval;Bottle tasted @ Jimmy43s. Wine glass. I may or may not have had their pommeau a few times before reviewing this one. :D Slightly hazed, aged yellow body, made a touch darker by the room�s lighting. Smell straight off is rough. Sulphor, stinky cheese, moldy hay/lawn trimmings, & all boldly so. Once all that airs out(or you take a long enough breath), you get some earthy caramelized & sharp apples, along with some mold/wood rot. Didn�t get a chance to check out the cork. Taste is much better, but not amazing. Quick hitting acid & tarts, they soon die, leaving a delicate/soft apple sweetness & some green grapes skin tannins. Softly carbed & a touch slick. It sadly all dries out & disappears without much of a fight. Lacked some structure, & the barnyard was way over the top imo. Hope they were just some old bottles.

Bayeux Cidre de Normandie Brut;Gu�ron, France;Apple Cider;Cidrerie Viard;Bottle from Super U Thury-Harcourt. Pours clear orange with some fine lacing. Sweet and dry apples, very woody and somewhat nutty. Moderate sweet, quite dry and bitter, light tart green apple. Medium body and soft carbonation. A bit dull and plain but still quite alright.
Yarpivo Temnoe (Dark);Yaroslavl, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);In the 500 mL bottle from Gomer�s. Pours a light brown color with amber highlights. Decent head of a beige yellow ochre color. Fairy good malty aroma, but does have a bit of that adjunct cheap malt liquor aroma. Flavor is nice in that it has a big malty sweetness and an interesting nutty taste. Fairly good I�d say.
Yarpivo Temnoe (Dark);Yaroslavl, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);Another random Russian beer I picked up at Lukas Liquor in Kansas City. This is a medium to dark brown bodied beer with garnet high lights. The head is frothy with a very light khaki color. The aroma has some light toffee with some old apples. The taste is mild and light cherries with some Oreo cookie filling. There is also a little bit of weak coffee. This is actually a decent dunkel.
Yarpivo Temnoe (Dark);Yaroslavl, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);According to their website, this brew has been made since 1997. Without freshness dating, I have no guarantees that it hasn�t been sitting around since then. Has the roasted malt thing going in the nose, but it�s unpolished. I don�t remember this brewery when I was in Russia. Must be a new brewer. Smells somewhat German. Dark amber, slightly hazy. Small, light tan head that is mostly diminishing to the point of virtually no head. This apparently is their highest rated brew. Took awhile for my palate to get used to it. Didn�t taste very good at first. Not a match for Baltika 6, but has to be one of the better beers made in Russia right now. I would take Stepan Razin Porter above it as well. Not bad, though.
Yarpivo Temnoe (Dark);Yaroslavl, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);Reddish brown lager with a thin off white head. Faint aroma of caramel and chalk. In mouth, rather bland sweet malt with no hops, light to medium bodied, boring beer, bought about 6 months ago.
Yarpivo Temnoe (Dark);Yaroslavl, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);Bottle: Poured an amber red with just a thin head. A hint of brown sugar in the aroma. The flavor is starkly cooked malt, brown sugar, candied malt. More oktoberfesty than dunkel-like.
Yarpivo Temnoe (Dark);Yaroslavl, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);Light Brown to Brown Red Coloring with a Light Sandy Skin. Sweet Malt, Almost Fruity Acidity Taste to It. Light Dry Wheat Ending. Certainly an Interesting Brew. If you Said Dunkel, I don�t Think I Would Have Believed it.
Yarpivo Temnoe (Dark);Yaroslavl, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);Dark brown color with a thin head. Nice aroma of malt and maple syrup. Pretty much the same story in the taste, but the maple turns dry. Not bad at all.
Yarpivo Temnoe (Dark);Yaroslavl, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);Much more of an American dark than a dunkel, even though I�m sure the brewer has no conception of such a beer. Good appearance, like a brown ale. Brown with a large, tan, long lasting head. Flavor of an ordinary, pale lager. Thin. Reminds me of a malt liquor.
Yarpivo Temnoe (Dark);Yaroslavl, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);Beer poured a deep brownish-orange with a large, creamy head. Musty aroma was sourly hopped and oatmeal. Sweet-tart flavor, like cranberry fruit juice with a latent cinnamon spiciness. Not bad... would pair well with a baloney sandwich and chips. Bridgeview Liquors
Yarpivo Temnoe (Dark);Yaroslavl, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);Pours a clear brown drink with reddish highlights and a creamy tan head. Subtle aromas of roasted malts and a sweet nuttiness are echoed in the flavor, along with a surprizing touch of chocolate. It�s a bit watery with a wanting finish, but it�s definitely a drinkable beer. Bridgeview Liquors, Bridgeview, IL
Yarpivo Kristallnoe Pshenichnoe (Crystal Wheat);Yaroslavl, Russia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);Golden colour with a slight haze. Kind of an old socks aroma. Slight green apple note. Sweet & sour finish. Doesn�t really meet too many of the style�s criteria.

Astoria River City Raz;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Astoria Brewing Co. (Wet Dog Cafe);Astoria (Wet Dog Cafe) on tap: Soft and creamy up front, but finished crisp. Light sweetness in the malts. Light raspberry flavors and aromas. Tasted a lot like the wheat, but with a little raspberry infusion. Refreshing, but nothing to write home about (though, I'm writing on RateBeer about it).

Freist�dter Weihnachts Bock;Freistadt, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Braucommune Freistadt;Actually not half bad at all. THe nose is lightly malted with a bit of caramel, grains and mild caramel notes. A bit of sweetness and light malty notes. A few citrus notes and not much else.
Freist�dter Weihnachts Bock;Freistadt, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Braucommune Freistadt;Bottle. Medium golden, leaning toward bronze, with an average white head that retains rather poorly. Aroma is sweet and grainy as expected, but with subtle honey notes. Palate is unexpectedly more characterful than most bocks I�ve had. The sweet corn syrup graininess that usually dominates is supplanted by honey tones and a pleasant toastiness. The hoppy finish is pleasant bitter and slightly floral. I actually really did enjoy this! I was beginning to think that bock = malt liquor (much like European strong lager = malt liquor), but I am happy to be proven wrong. This was very good.
Freist�dter Weihnachts Bock;Freistadt, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Braucommune Freistadt;330ml green bottle. Label is Freistadter Bock�l, assuming it�s the same?

Freist�dter Weihnachts Bock;Freistadt, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Braucommune Freistadt;Bottle. Gold with a good white head. Strong grain scent. Flavour is kind of nice. A little more balanced than the others in the Big Box of Bock or I am getting used to this interpretation of the style. A little harshness, lots of grain and a balanced high alcohol note that blends together OK.

Rieder Dunkle Weisse;Ried, Austria;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei Ried;500 ml flip-top bottle from a supermarket, bb 23.09.16 Dark orange-brown, cloudy body, with a big, fluffy, lacing, light beige head. Aroma of banana, spices, orange, some citrus, some bread, some caramel. Taste follows this, with sour fruits, some more cocoa and toasty notes. Medium, oily mouthfeel, with a lively carbonation. Finishes spicy, medium sour fruity, bready, a bit toasty, yeasty, with cocoa again. Good, but nothing special. Quaffable and easy, but quite flat for this style, with sourish notes I don�t like that much. Some nice cocoa notes though. Not among the better beers from Rieder in my opinion.
Rieder Dunkle Weisse;Ried, Austria;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauerei Ried;Hazy, amber with frothy, white head. Banana aroma. Heavy sweetness. Medium body, average carbonation.
Rieder Festbock;Ried, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Ried;Slightly hazed golden liquid. Moderate sized, off-white head. Industrial scents, with heavy malts and grains, along with a spicy mix of hops and alcohol. Flavors are not as harsh as the aromas. Still a touch grainy, but still a decent pale malt depth. Hops are more floral than the aroma suggests. Nice feel. Comes off more like a strong lager. 5/11
Rieder Festbock;Ried, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Ried;Sweet malt dominates this heller bock, slightly hazy golden with creamy off white head. Slightly musty aroma, sourdough, bubblegum. Taste is sweet malt with some sourness on the tail end. Mouthfeel is heavy but slick. Still good, although I think this sample was nearing the end of its shelf life.
Rieder Festbock;Ried, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Ried;Chevy Chase, DC 500ml ($4): Pours a slightly cloudy yellow/gold body with a white head. Aroma is bubblegum, nondescript fruitiness, and sugar. Yes, this beer is chewy. Bubblegum taste all around this jawn. Some hop bitterness, especially towards the end of it. Fortunately, there be no alcohol taste. I don�t know if this is something that I would care to have again, but it is fine.
Rieder Festbock;Ried, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Ried;500ml bottle. Hazy golden-tan body with a big, steady white head. Sweet, sugary malt aroma, some faint bocky pungency and light noble hops. Rather drinkable, fresh enough, considering it�s probably had a longish shelf life. Clean golden malt tone, almost watery. A little thin on the body, but that is always better than a syrupy, overbearing mess. This is a pretty respectable Heller-Bock, Grassy noble hops, pretty subdued. A decent beer, enjoyable.
Rieder Festbock;Ried, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Ried;Bottle: Pours a clear rich golden with a spotty-lacing smallish covering of white head. Has a lightly sweet caramel and grainy pale malty nose with some light fruity esters and a touch of noble hops. Starts with pretty good fullness with a nice pale malty sweetness and good bittering hop balance before a slightly warming semi-sweet finish. True to style with a pleasant light fruity complexity throughout.
Rieder Festbock;Ried, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Ried;Bottle from Cliff�s on Rt. 1 in Darlington, MD. Pours a cloudy light straw color with a huge fluffy white head. Lots of sweet malt in the nose. Sweet taste, not much in the way of hops to counteract it. Decent mouthfeel, almost chewy. Almost too seet for my taste, but still a quality beer.
Rieder Festbock;Ried, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Ried;16.9 oz bottle 9/5/11 (Binny�s Naperville)-50� in Lager Glass-Pours a clear yellowish golden with a small white head.

Rieder Festbock;Ried, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Ried;Bottle: Pours a clear gold color with a white head. Nose of cherry and hay with some husk and grainy note, moderate alcohol with a touch of maple syrup. The flavor is a little thick with honey, husk and more hay notes. Finishes decently with a bit more of a balanced mouthfeel and creamy finish.
Rieder Festbock;Ried, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Ried;500 ml returnable bomber. All it says is best by 14. Pours a nice vibrant gold with a nice white head that leaves a bti of lacing. The smell is your typical fare. It is a Munich Helles base with the slightest heightened levels of caramel and hops. The taste is grainy with some hops in the middle and aftertaste. The finish is semi-dry. It is a good clean Maibock with no off flavors, one of the better ones I have tried it isn�t too rich, there is balance. The 7% of alcohol is immensely hidden, it is like drinking a standard lager. This style is a bit ambiguous but this is a good example of what it should be. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 05-25-2010 23:00:21
Rieder Festbock;Ried, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Ried;Bottle. Pours a nice clear straw golden with a creamy dense white head. Aroma is sweet and grassy, invitingly warm and rich. Flavor has some off notes, butterscotch, some apple, sweet grassy, bit of tootsie roll actually which is odd, light bit of bitterness with the alcohol in the finish. Medium bodied with fizzy fine carbonation. Not bad, very drinkable for a heller bock.

Archers Signalmans Stout;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Stout;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Dark brown with a thin, well defined white ringlet of a head. Roasted malts that aren�t overpowering, yet sufficiently complex to keep you sipping. I had several and I�m still not sure.
Ventnor Hygeia Organic Ale;Ventnor, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ventnor Brewery;500ml Bottle - I remember this from back in the day as being a fairly bland bitter with earthy citrus notes. Rough around the edges but it had potential.

Ventnor Hygeia Organic Ale;Ventnor, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ventnor Brewery;Cask Conditioned, Masque Haut, London. If you ever get the chance to go to Ventnor, which is on the southern facing coast of the Isle of white (itself and island of the south of England) then do so. This down is spectacular. There�s one hold-in-the-wall real ale establishment and anyone who knows even half a bit about beer should be able to set you in the right direction. If you�re a bit of a walker, the island is 110-120km in circumference and can be walked around in 4 days in reasonable comfort (beer for lunch and dinner). Sadly this beer was neither, consumed on site (Ventnor) nor was it good. The beer was a cloudy honied colour, with a sticky grey head. Has the sweet twisted aroma of sweaty socks and taste like it�s only half fermented. Sharp and abrasive finisher.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #03 - Abbey Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Harpoon Brewery;When I�m looking for an abbey dubbel, the last brewery I think of is Harpoon. It was surprisingly decent though. Very smooth. Rated 4/17/04
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #03 - Abbey Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Harpoon Brewery;Appropriately cloudy with a slight dark golden color. I like the creamy white head although it dissapates quickly and leaves scant lace. Citrusy wheat aromas, this smells similar to a hefeweizen. Strong carbonation at the front of the taste. The first impression is a neutral malty flavor that quickly gives way to a complex array of citrus, malt sugars and a bitter floral hop touch. The beer seems to be heading to the wheat flavors, but stops short. Instead, the flavors become creamy and sour. This lingers through the aftertaste. The only real distraction is the high level of carbonation. In many ways, this abbey ale has less of the undesireable characteristics of its mentors--less barnyard aromas and flavors.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #03 - Abbey Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Harpoon Brewery;this bottle lasted the best out of the bunch quite delicious .tasted like a true belgian
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #03 - Abbey Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Harpoon Brewery;Considering what I went though to track a bottle of this one down (finally found a bottle tucked away in a dark cooler in a small bottleshop), I found this to be a pretty poor example of a dubbel. Pours copper with a thin white head. Smells more like a simple white beer with coriander and other orangey notes present. Taste is very orangey with some coriander and banana notes. Disappointing.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #03 - Abbey Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Harpoon Brewery;1 PT., 6 fl. oz Bottle (Session 03, Batch Date: 9/8/03) � Sampled late January 2005: clear, sun-struck copper with an off-tan tightly bubbled foam. Yeasty esters float above the glass with orange-banana alcohol, bubblegum, and peach fuzz. Bready flavours with loads of thick grains, pale malt and buttered dough. Flecks of pepper are noticeable right before a short, slightly dry finish. The carbonation is a bit harsh, and though this ones leaves me wishing for a bit more complexity, it was a decent dough/yeasty treat.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #03 - Abbey Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Harpoon Brewery;"Appearance: clear, bright peacy color, with a big, thick, foamy white head. Nice looking, but from the name ""abbey ale"" I expected something different. Maybe more like a dubbel or a tripel? Aroma: sweet, candyish, fruity, citric, I�m really picking up a witbier vibe in this, and I also, as others have mentioned, can easily discern that ""bubblegum phenol"" that�s all over this...a little unsettling, actually. Taste: smooth, easy, and shallow in the arena of complexity, I�m sorry to say. Quite quaffable, with that sweet, candyish character remaining throughout. Very light in body, with minimal texture, and a forgettable finish. It�s a good solid beer, but hard to categorize, feeling like a cross between a witbier and a tripel, without containing the better parts of both."
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #03 - Abbey Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Harpoon Brewery;08.14.04 bottle. Maze and orange pour with middling head. Smells like a Belgian ale light. The body of this brew reminds of a dubbel, but everything else is like a watered down trippel. Pretty peppery and spicey. Sharp effervescence adds to a dry, Belgian yeasty finish. The finish seems dramatically out of place with this subtle and light brew. Only Harpoon could make an �abbey style ale� (what is that?) that is so markedly diluted and over-refined.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #03 - Abbey Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Harpoon Brewery;"The bottle is dated 9/8/03, so this one must have been sitting in the store for quite a while. The beer has a light peach color, with a short, white head that dissipates very quickly. There�s a slightly yeasty aroma, but it�s not as strong as most other belgian style ales that I�ve had. There is a surprising amount of carbonation; if you pour it quickly there is quite a bit of fizzing. The flavor is fruity and sweet with some tanginess, but it�s still a little too bland. I think a bit more yeast would be nice, and more maltiness to give it a richer palate. Overall it�s pretty good, but in the future I think I�ll just stick with Allagash when I want this kind of beer."
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #03 - Abbey Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Harpoon Brewery;The beer after extravasates the 22 ounce brown bottle set in the glass an opalescent and slightly hazy orange, the head is moderate in size, creamy in texture and a toothsome light tan. The nose is sweetly malt, fresh crisp and clean with a slight hint of yeast, a nice sniffable beer, start is sweet and pleasingly malted, the top is middling in its feel to the palate. The finish is sternly acidic, the hop pleasing and relatively mild, quite dry aftertaste that lingers long on the palate.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #03 - Abbey Style Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Harpoon Brewery;22oz Bomber Batch Date 9/8/03 Poured a glowing cloudy orange with a small head that dissapeared rather fast leaving only thin scattered dollops of foam. Has alot of yeast in the aroma along with some Tripel like notes of spice and fruit. The mouthfeel on this ale is excellent. Effervescent and medium bodied that is slightly creamy. Flavor is much like a Tripel in my opinion. Fruity and spicy with notes of candy sugar and Belgium yeast. Although not to style, this ale is still a decent effort for such a large and what I consider lackluster brewery. At least they didn't incorporate their one dimensional use of cascade pellets to this one. Ouch!
Nethergate Sweet Chariot;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Britannia, London. Amber with just the thinnest of white heads.

Bent River American Wheat;Moline, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Bent River Brewing Company;20100608 Tap at brewpub. I mean, it�s an American Wheat, so I didn�t expect much. Kind of grainy. Flavorful, like breakfast cereal, and not that I wanted to have a flavor glass of cereal, but at least it�s not totally bland. Really, Bent River, throwing a hop pellet or two in here wouldn�t kill you. Unremarkable.
Bent River American Wheat;Moline, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Bent River Brewing Company;clear copper color. Very light aroma. Some wheaty notes. Taste is metallic grain. Wheat finish with soil and some small bits of citrus. Fairly standard.
Bent River Mississippi Blonde;Moline, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bent River Brewing Company;Bottle. Yellow color and less carbonation than the average yellow lager. No aroma really. Some grain in the flavor. It reminded me of a kolsch. Nothing here to enjoy and it has a stupid kind of sexist label.
Bent River Mississippi Blonde;Moline, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bent River Brewing Company;Cold from the bottle. Taste, notable carbonation turns to a light caramel and just a hint of fruity hops-light plum. Finish is slightly sweet with lingering plum. A very crisp refreshing ale would pair well with BBQ, a bologna sandwich or any other out door orientated summer meal. Interesting ale.

Bent River Mississippi Blonde;Moline, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bent River Brewing Company;My first try out of a beer club delivery. I do not think a blonde ale is high on my list to buy but let�s give it a shot. Actually it pours nicely, a straw yellow with a bubbly white foam that recedes promptly but does leave a nice lace on the glass. I scent hay and not much more. The taste is a little citrus and then some grain. Palate is decently all right with a small bitterness lingering for awhile as a finish. Nothing wow, not expected. This is more a summer drink ice cold after mowing the yard.
Bent River Mississippi Blonde;Moline, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bent River Brewing Company;Bottle from hayduke. Pours hazy blonde with a decent white head and a floral aroma. There is a slghtly sour pale malt flavor with a dry finish. May have gone bad.
Bent River Mississippi Blonde;Moline, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bent River Brewing Company;I think this is the first brown bottle US craft beer I�ve ever gotten that�s been skunked.

It�s got a mild floral hop character and a bit of bready malt to it. It�s light but not watery w/ crisp carbonation and very drinkable.

Bent River Strawberry Ale;Moline, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bent River Brewing Company;Draft - Strawberry jam, but smells fresh not like an adjunct. Cloudy gold with a decent white head. Light tartness, mellow strawberry and pale malts. Not to sweet and true to the fruit.

Bent River Strawberry Ale;Moline, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bent River Brewing Company;Draft at the Bent River brewpub. Poured a mostly clear yellow straw color with a small white head. Aroma was light sweet cereals, malts, and a touch of sweet fruits.

Aroma of wheat, yeast and strawberry. Taste of candied strawberry that leaves a bad aftertaste. Lively carbonation feel and kind of cloying.
Bent River Strawberry Ale;Moline, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bent River Brewing Company;"Draft at Bent River. Hazy golden honey colored body. Light honey and fruit sweetness up front, but transparent and generic ""fruit"" is all that it suggests... over time there�s some sort of berry flavor that develops, but it could be strawberry as much as it could be blueberry as much as it could be benzaldehyde. Bland, nearly flavorless finish. Just basically ""blah""."
Bent River Strawberry Ale;Moline, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bent River Brewing Company;This looked fine, an orange/gold body with a full head that laced the glass nicely, but the aroma was a strong, overly sweet candy-fruit smell. They may indeed have used the real fruit as claimed, but the flavor was like crummy candy, too. Bent River Brewing Company, Moline, IL

Bent River Uncommon Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Bent River Brewing Company;Pour is a decent black with a monster tan head. Aroma is pretty much all bitter bakers chocolate with a nice roasted malt. Flavor is more of the same. Bitter bakers chocolate is way up front this a nice roast and char is left on the tongue.

Bent River Uncommon Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Bent River Brewing Company;Bottle that poured with a very light tan head and strong lacing. Very strong coffee flavors with just a touch of chocolate undertones. A very strong coffee with a bitter aftertaste.

Bent River Uncommon Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Bent River Brewing Company;"Draft, 4 ounce sample glass Growler USA, Omaha. It smelled good; light oatmeal, mild coffee. The problem was that it had a sour note in the finish. Tasted like it was going sour. The good people at Growler USA did not charge me for the sample. I will re-rate if I ever see it again."
Bent River Uncommon Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Bent River Brewing Company;Its very interesting. Aroma is fresh brewed coffee. Black appearance. I would call this a Sour Stout. Its fresh coffee with a sharp, tart, tang of a sour. Its interesting.
Bent River Uncommon Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Bent River Brewing Company;Pours an oily black with a medium, dark tan head that steadily fades. The aroma contains heavier coffee and roasted malts, chocolate, and some mild smoke. The taste is dry and is a little sweet. While still being potent in coffee, I now get a strong chocolate flavor to balance it. Undertones consist of roasted malts, caramel, nuts, and cherry. The cherry is most pronounced at the end of the sip, making up a short and sharp aftertaste. This one is medium in body, with a creamy texture, and with soft carbonation. A pretty solid offering overall.
Bent River Uncommon Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Bent River Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle poured to a Czech-pils glass at home, displaying a black/brown/hue with some ruby highlighting noticed during the pour, persistent, brownish tan froth, and wavy ribbons and spots of lacing. The nose was malty, roasted, coffee, nutty chocolate bar, light woodiness and a little char, with blueberry playing a secondary, but noticeable role. Medium bodied, with initially lively carbonation, berry tartness & tanginess were dominant in the flavor, with a touch of sweetness, and Stout characteristics that diminished almost altogether, as though I was offered a Sour for the tasting phase. Tart astringency finished the deal. Confusing, if you�re concerned about the style, but actually, rather tasty otherwise.
Bent River Uncommon Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Bent River Brewing Company;Obtained in a 12 oz. bottle. It delivers a dark chocolate brown body with a dark tan head, fairly low carbonation. It definitely smells and tastes of coffee. Burnt oak flavor on the tongue and I also get molasses along with a touch of sweetness. It gets better as you go along. It appears I am spoiled by imperial stouts and my ventures into regulars or oatmeals do not go well. My bottle was labeled as having 5.4% ABV. No hint of it. I think it would be better at the listed 6.5%
Bent River Uncommon Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Bent River Brewing Company;Bottle - bog tan foamy head, black color, big roasted coffee aroma and flavor, definitely on the bitter side (more from the coffee than the hops it seems, and not in a good way), if you are a coffee person you will probably like this, I am not a coffee person myself, so it�s only OK in my book

Good. The aroma was strongly of coffee and a hint of chocolate. The flavor contained elements of dark roasted malt, coffee and bitter baker�s chocolate. The roastedness lingers on the long dry finish. This body is far too watery to consider this a stout.
Johnstown Steelworkers Stout;Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Dry;Johnstown Brewing Company;Super-roasty but watery, with a distinct burnt flavor. If they roasted their own malt, I�d say they overdid it. Dusty charcoal finish. Gets points for being dry, but it�s not very good. Update: Still thin, but the terrible charred taste is gone.

De Landtsheer Aymon;Buggenhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Malheur (formerly De Landtsheer);"Commissioned beer for a beer club in Dendermonde and named after a Dendermondish count; tasted from a 75 cl corked bottle. Rocky, yellowish white, big and nicely lacing foam, colour a deep �old gold� with rosy and pale orangey shades, clear but ever more dark and cloudy when adding the deposit. Aroma of unripe pear, hazelnuts, green apple, fresh olives, cheese spread, bitter honey, lemon zest, grass, peated whisky and plastic. The mouth gets a citrussy sourishness at first - as with so many Belgian ales - to become smoothly and rather deeply malty after that, not surprising considering the fact that De Landtsheer used 5 malts in this, caramel, nuts and again that vague smoky touch, herbal and lightly spicy hops appear quite early and becomes more prominent in the finish, where it is accompanied by warming, bourbon- to brandy-like alcohol, that does not become astringent."

New Glarus Unplugged Imperial Stout;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;New Glarus Brewing Company;My 2800th rating. 169 for this beer. 12 oz. bottle shared by STLWill- thanks a ton, Will! Will initially thought this was a 2005 bottle, but 2003 appears to be when this was released. Pours an opaque, smooth, deep brown with a tiny beige ring. Carbonation appears to be gone. Aroma of roasted malts, cocoa powder, molasses, soy, cola, and only the faintest trace of oxidation. Flavof of soy, chocolate, molasses, caramel malts, earth, coffee, and toasted brown sugar. Light-to-medium-bodied, with minimal carbonation and a smooth, sweet, and only mildly roasty mouthfeel. Down, but not out.
New Glarus Unplugged Imperial Stout;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle generously shared by BenC...thanks Ben! - Pours deep and dark with a thin tan head. A bit of booziness on the nose, with sweet dark malt, hints of molasses, smoke, charcoal, and a decent amount of sweetness. Not terribly pungent. Taste is a bit ashy, subdued, and drier than the nose. Finishes with the same booziness and some sweet dark bready malt. Fairly thin, especially for a imperial stout. Just like the Triple before this, my guess is this is way past its prime.
New Glarus Unplugged Imperial Stout;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle. From 2003 I believe. Pours a deep black color with a very minimal head, swirling causes a tan head to form. Dark grain type aroma with a touch of dark fruit, very un-imperial stout smelling. Medium mouthfeel and light than I would have expected for this style. The taste is very mild as well with no real strong tastes of coffee, roast, or dark chocolate. I get a slight soy taste and smell as well. Not a beer that I would recommend at this point. More like a dark lager than anything.
New Glarus Unplugged Imperial Stout;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;New Glarus Brewing Company;"2003(?) Vintage 3/03/2010: New Glarus Unplugged Imperial Stout... Aroma: Not much to speak of save some light dark chocolate notes; maybe some Tootsie Roll. Appearance: Dark ruby-brown color; minimal carbonation; fleeting surface bubbles. Flavor: Cola, weak citrus and darkly carmelized malts; weak chocolate; sweetness has taken over and depth and complexity has faded; mineral quality in the middle; no alcohol showing whatsoever; sweet coffee finish (almost like coffee-flavored hard candy); grows on me with each sip. Palate: Medium, thinned out. Overall: Decent beer, but well-past its glory days... nice finish though. 12 fl. oz. bottle (pop-off cap) from awaller05 via trade. Thanks Andy!

Nimbus Koko-Nitro Porter;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Porter - Imperial;Nimbus Brewing Company;"nitro tap at brewery-pours very dark, amost black with a nice smooth brown head. looks better than most nitro pours. huge baking chocloate and roasted aroma-dusty esters also aparent.

Nimbus Koko-Nitro Porter;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Porter - Imperial;Nimbus Brewing Company;A nice porter.... that took about 2 to 3 minutes to pour. Nice color and for the most part worth the wait. Not as godd as say Anchor Porter, but still worth a try.
Nimbus Koko-Nitro Porter;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Porter - Imperial;Nimbus Brewing Company;There is a solid roast aroma in this beer. It is a black color (perhaps a hint of a dark brown hue as well), and is topped by a solid, dense, creamy brown head. The taste is of chocolate up front, but then moves to roasted notes and finishes with an acidic twang. This is a very creamy smooth beer with almost no carbonation. This is a full flavored example of a Guinness draft, and it is far superior.
Nimbus Koko-Nitro Porter;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Porter - Imperial;Nimbus Brewing Company;At the brewery, I was served this porter on nitro, which I alway love. The chocolate was not very noticeable. The porter was more like a stout. It took a while to pour as well as settle, but a fine brew.
Nimbus Koko-Nitro Porter;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Porter - Imperial;Nimbus Brewing Company;Wow! Gorgeous DEEP chestnut color. Watching the nitro bubbles in this one is a treat. Smooth, smoky, chocolatey malt flavor balanced out nicely by what taste to me like english hops. Finishes clean and dry. Medium to medium heavy body, smooth butter mouthfeel. Very nice. Watch not to get dehydrated!
Shoes Farriers Ale;Norton Cannon, Herefordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Shoes Brewery;Cask gravity, Beer on The Wye 6, Hereford (�Farrier�s Ale, 14.7% ABV� according to the festival programme, but actually weighing in at an eye-watering 15.5% ABV according to the cask). Dusty golden amber, no head, massive legs. Sherry in a cave aroma. Nil malt or hop presence. Huge alcohol warm, moulding grapeskin and satsumas, dabs of cream. Chews with mildewed, dusty, sherried old fruit long after it�s gone. Slight numbing of the hands, cheap blended whiskey burn....and yet almost leaves you almost wanting a pair. Almost. Mad, utterly mad, and even after 3.5K, I�m pretty stunned by this one.
Shoes Farriers Ale;Norton Cannon, Herefordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Shoes Brewery;"Light haze in light-amber beer, small transparent head. Acetone, acetic, pineapple and other esters. Very old sherry from the wood, and lightly acidic; bit of solvent, and certainly fusels. Not very well-bodied, acids & esters thinning the MF. Where really is the difference with the stronger Beer?

Slghtly hazy, rich mahoganny brown/ orange color wih some bubbling but a very small white rim. Strong toffe aroma with some wood. Shouts booze and some nail polish. Not good. Strange, slightly spicy flavor with an acidic touch, some wook and whisky, a bit of smoke but a great, and I mean great, alocoholic burnt. Very hard. Medium to light palate, the very alcoholic feeling makes it very difficult to drink. Strange, but rather unpleasant strong ale.
Shoes Farriers Ale;Norton Cannon, Herefordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Shoes Brewery;Bottle at Toms Ultimate Glasgow Tasting : Clear with no head. The aroma is very alcohol. The taste is like fuel in a bottle. I rather drink my wifes nail polish remover!
Shoes Farriers Ale;Norton Cannon, Herefordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Shoes Brewery;Bottle at glasgow ultimate tasting.

Shoes Farriers Ale;Norton Cannon, Herefordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Shoes Brewery;Bottles at Toms Ultimate Glasgow Tasting ... YEUCH, thats about it. we had 14% and 15.5% bottles Very rought no balance. I could maybe have finnished the 14% but the 15.5 was like raw alcohol.
Shoes Farriers Ale;Norton Cannon, Herefordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Shoes Brewery;Bottle Conditioned. A brown Amber beer with bubbly head. I'm not normally given to supelatives, nor do I often get close to giving perfect marks, but this beer is very special. Its from a brewpub I had never heard of before, and so it seems has the site. The beer is perfectly brewed, it has a vintage port wine flavour, the spare sugar is all brewed out to leave a dry rich vinous flavour with strawberries and plum as a background. There is even a hop aftertaste. The body is a perfect harmony of stillness but still natural condition. I'm not sure how this can be obtained again as it was a gift, I presume it is only available at the Brewpub, but it is a very, very good beer.

Russell New England Dry Cider;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;Russell Orchards;"Bottle thanks to nimbleprop! Clear, pale gold. Sweet apple flesh and dry skin, Beautiful vibrant nose. Flavor dries out gorgeously, with the alcohol there but stunning attenuation. Tastes like a cider should; nothing crazy or surprising, but dry, crisp, and full. This is damn good."
Russell New England Dry Cider;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;Russell Orchards;Very pale bright gold/white color. Quite clear. No head. Smells very sharp of green apples, (I think, I really know very little about ciders). Has a very pleasant floral smell as well, somewhat spicy. Opens up true to its name, quite dry, crisp, not like the apple flavor in an APA. Light to medium light body, no wateriness, carbonation surprisingly not a problem. Finishes with a nice honey/fructose sweetness. Good true apple flavor, maybe not the most complex, but definitely good.
Thomas Hooker Liberator Doppelbock;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Finally tried this because of the 50% clearance. Would say worth the $4 and change, but couldn't see spending over $8. Solid beer still...think Ayinger's Celebrator is the way to go though in this style. Best part about this is the creamy mouthfeel texture along with the super-dark brown (near black) appearance. Has potential to be slightly better with the flavor, but could have been the bottle was close to a year old. Slightly rusty/metallic in the end. Worth the try for the price slash, but not sure if I would get again.
Thomas Hooker Liberator Doppelbock;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Not sure why this beer is listed as retired, friend brought back a growler of fresh beer from Thomas Hooker Brewery in Hartford. Pours ruby amber with thin, beige head. Aroma is caramel, dried fruit and light hops. Taste is sweet caramel and plum, moving to light roast and cardamom. Finish is smooth malt. An excellent beer.
Thomas Hooker Liberator Doppelbock;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Bottle. I was excited to finally try this one! It pours a dark reddish brown color with a small, fizzy light brown head. The aroma has hints of cherry cola, rich toasted melanoidens, light caramel and hints of spicy/herbal hops. The flavor is the same. Pretty rich with well developed carmelized malt, toasted melanoidens and some low earthy/spicy bitterness. Medium bodied. Pretty traditional in character. I liked it.
Thomas Hooker Liberator Doppelbock;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Originally reviewed 6/2/2011. Deep brown body that looks red when held up to the light. Off-white frothy head that leaves some lacing. Dark fruit aroma followed by caramel and some chocolate. Nice. Taste is not quite as impressive as the smell, but very nice nonetheless. Dark fruits and caramel malts. Some burnt toast in the back end, but it�s not unappealing. Hardly sweet, despite the maltiness. Good body. Not quite heavy, but certainly not light. Doesn�t feel like a wimpy beer, despite that you can�t taste the ABV. Medium-low carbonation makes it feel smooth and creamy. One of the better doppelbocks I�ve had.
Thomas Hooker Liberator Doppelbock;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Solid beer but it felt a bit flat, Malty and nice color, not too bitter and good overall, will try another one to see if the flatness was just a one off.
Thomas Hooker Liberator Doppelbock;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;12oz bottle picked up at the source about a year ago. Aroma is molasses, raisin, date. Tastes just like it smells. Rich molasses, raisins, date. Perfectly on style.
Thomas Hooker Liberator Doppelbock;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Poured from bottle thanks Willrunforbeer murky reddish brown with a nice tan head. Aromas of toasty malt dark fruit and bread. Taste is smooth and has a great balance with the roasted malt fruit and a nice alcohol warmth.
Thomas Hooker Liberator Doppelbock;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;"Poured from ""howler"" almost 2 weeks old transported almost 900 miles! Very nice murky reddish brown pour, minimal beige head. Understandable. Aroma is certainly malty, and brewery with some fruitiness. Taste is candy and bread. Overall I enjoyed this and would like to try it freshly poured. I also have one bottle to try. Thank you Sharon for dragging this one third of the way across country!"
Thomas Hooker Munich-Style Golden Lager;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Bottle. Aroma is yeasty dough with European bready malts. Appearance is lightly hazy gold with excellent sparkle and 1/2 finger-width, frothy white head with poor retention and minimal lacing. Taste is lightly sweet European bready malts with hints of citrus. Palate is light to medium bodied with creamy texture, soft carbonation supporting the beer and mildly buzzing the edges and tip of the tongue. Finish is abrupt, dry and minimally bitter. Overall, this beer has pretty pedestrian aroma and taste but an attractive presentation and pleasing palate.
Thomas Hooker Munich-Style Golden Lager;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Bottle at my parents. I grabbed this haphazardly while filling out mix 6. Dusty golden in color almost no head. Nose is faint malt and grass. Tastes of grass, touch of herbs, wheat, basement, wild flowers. Crisp enough

Weaker white foam. Spotty lace. Nose is mild candies, toffee, grass, hay, moldy grain, rustic. Taste is a bit bland, suddy, weak with not a lot of malt presence. Watery, suddy body.

Russell New England Sweet Cider;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;Russell Orchards;Uncarbonated, clear pale yellow. Sweet apple aroma with metallic notes follow into the cider�s rather weird aftertaste, or, perhaps, �weird tongue sensation� would be more accurate. Fairly sweet.
Russell Perry;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Perry;Russell Orchards;Sample, thanks to Kolschtrinker. Many thanks! Pours clear pale greenish yellow. Aroma is rather medicinal, similar to dentist mouthwash. Taste is dentist mouthwash, menthol, medicinal, no perry pear fruit to speak of. Very bizarre.
Russell Perry;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Perry;Russell Orchards;Danke an Erzengel. Muffiger, dunkel birniger Beginn. �lige Konsistenz, w�ssriges Aroma. Wenig bis keine W�rzigkeit. Meh.. 9/7/5/5/11/5
Russell Perry;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Perry;Russell Orchards;Many thanks to Rian for this 75cl bottle. Fruity nose of ripe fruity pears. The perry begins light and not very deep. Fruity pears there, but very thin, not a long aftertaste, fruity but very watery and thin. Sad. Easy to drink but not much pear aroma there. Hints of sweetish pears in the aftertaste.
Russell Perry;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Perry;Russell Orchards;750ml bottle pours a clear gold with zero head. Nose has lots of honey, pear, some gum. Flavor is sweet, buttery, pear. Oily finish.

Russell Perry;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Perry;Russell Orchards;Very pale yellow color with no real carbonation to speak of. Slightly leathery tannin aroma with sweet pear hints in the background. Lightly sweet flavor with a drier finish. Not super complex, but light and fairly elegant for perry.
Russell Perry;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Perry;Russell Orchards;Slightly hazy medium to light gold colored cider with some lighter greenish/white tinges. No head, moderately bubbly. Smells of peppery apple blossoms (probably more like pear blossoms actually). Good crisp light pear aroma, a touch of alcohol. Really outstanding. Taste is not what I expected at all. Very dry and well done. Subtle pear taste, with some moderately sharp floral notes, some nice herbal tastes as well. I really wish I knew more about ciders. I can't really rate this well. Tastes more authentic than say Bulmers or Woodchuck, that's for sure.
Meinel-Br�u M�rzen;Hof, Bavaria, Germany;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Meinel-Br�u;Tap @ Meinel Bra�, Hof. Pours clear golden with a creamy white head. Very bready and dry. Malty qualities. Dry hoppy finish.

Johnstown White Hat Pale Ale;Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Johnstown Brewing Company;Fruity aroma, pours golden clear not bad head. Not too nice on the tongue and the finish just didnt impress me.
Johnstown White Hat Pale Ale;Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Johnstown Brewing Company;Has a mild fruity-hoppy aroma, mild sweet malts. Some caramel, orange peel, and brewed tea. Golden amber clear with thin off-white head. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Start with mild acidity, soft malts, and a light saltiness with good hop bitterness. Finish is solid bitterness with mild graininess. A tad watery and could use a bit more malt character, but a decent pale ale.
Johnstown White Hat Pale Ale;Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Johnstown Brewing Company;A strong citrus/Grapefruit flavor. This beer is too light on the hops for the style. However, it is probably the best the JBC has to offer.
Johnstown White Hat Pale Ale;Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Johnstown Brewing Company;Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a neutral brown color with a medium sized off white head. The aroma was faint grapefruit. The flavor starts out with grapefruit that falls off a watery cliff and has just a hint of malt underneath. Short grapefruit finish. Thin and watery body. Uninspired.
Johnstown White Hat Pale Ale;Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Johnstown Brewing Company;Lots of citrus in this one - lemon, melons, grapefruit - juicy. Flavor was pretty well balanced, but thin. Could use an extra dose of evertything - there just wasn�t enough flavor to go around.
Johnstown White Hat Pale Ale;Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Johnstown Brewing Company;Draught: Smelled of malt, hops, and a bit skunked. Looks thin. Light brown color. Nice head and lacing. Tastes slightly hoppy, and malty. A bit like a bock. Easy to drink, but still thin. A below par APA. Weak, thin, not too much flavor.
Johnstown White Hat Pale Ale;Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Johnstown Brewing Company;"The previous two ratings were entered about two months after the brewery began selling its own beer. I can only assume that the recipe has changed since then, because the new head brewer is changing most of the recipes. At any rate, this is not as insipid now as it apparently was then. Very juicy and full of lighter malts. The correct, orangey color. Hops are still very subdued; I wouldn�t call this a pale ale yet, but it�s drinkable, and something I�d have again if I were there. Update: Orangey aroma, now filtered, still watery, but hops and malt both ramped up. Rather decent specimen now. New score: 3.5"
Johnstown White Hat Pale Ale;Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Johnstown Brewing Company;(Draught) Thin, white with a yellow body. Thin and watery flavour. Lacking hops and nearly no flavour at all!
Johnstown White Hat Pale Ale;Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Johnstown Brewing Company;Not good at all, in fact this wanna-be pale ale is horrible, flavors were way off, very little hoppiness, very little maltiness, very little anything in this, not good at all
Kl�ter Winter Lager;Hradi�t� nad Jizerou, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Pivovar Kl�ter (Pivovary Lobkowicz);Clear gold with a two finger white head. Plenty of lacings. Aroma is malty. Taste is sweet malts with a balanced amount of hops. Mouthfeel is good with adequete carbonation and a nice dry finish. A sessionable beer in spite of the 5.8% abv. Give it a try, I definitely enjoyed this beer.
Kl�ter Winter Lager;Hradi�t� nad Jizerou, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Pivovar Kl�ter (Pivovary Lobkowicz);Tan-bronze with decent head. Aroma of candy corn and caramel malt and grains. Flavor is similar to the aroma, but a bit more reserved. Slight caramel and candy corn notes, mild graininess. Not bad
Kl�ter Winter Lager;Hradi�t� nad Jizerou, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Pivovar Kl�ter (Pivovary Lobkowicz);"15-Jul-08 (500-ml bottle: Purchased 03-Apr-08 for $2.25 from liquidsolutions.biz) Lighter in style than expected for a ""winter lager"", this malty beer is bready and mildly toasty with an odd buttery character that is rarely found in lagers. A very gentle Noble hop flavor and bitterness is nicely balanced against the malt base. Light-medium in body with gentle carbonation and a smooth, easy mouthfeel. Bready, grainy and very lightly toasty nose with no hop aroma. Clear and golden in color with a small, whitish head that holds a thin layer throughout most of the session. Not as ""wintery"" as I want from a winter beer, and the butteriness is out of place, but it�s tasty enough to finish the bottle. Not a repeat purchase though..."
Kl�ter Winter Lager;Hradi�t� nad Jizerou, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Pivovar Kl�ter (Pivovary Lobkowicz);Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a bright golden color with a large white soapy head.

Kl�ter Winter Lager;Hradi�t� nad Jizerou, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Pivovar Kl�ter (Pivovary Lobkowicz);500ml bottle. Clear, Light orange, golden color. White foamy head. Aroma of fresh sweet wort and a hint of mustiness. Really the aroma resembles a M�rzen. Flavor is an interesting malt and big bitterness. Lots of sweetness and a bold hop. This is made for American tastes. Not exactly to my liking but it is very bitter. For a European Lager, it lakes balance. Lingering bitterness,Medium bodied. Maybe different yeast profile and this would male a very good Pale Ale!
Kl�ter Winter Lager;Hradi�t� nad Jizerou, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Pivovar Kl�ter (Pivovary Lobkowicz);Ugh...terrible beer. Aroma was all metal. Pour was a thick nasty pee yellow with no head. Taste was very flat and metallic. Strong hints of copper and sweet malt in the front with a hint of hops in the aftertaste. To metallic tasting and hardly any carbonation. Blah.
Kl�ter Winter Lager;Hradi�t� nad Jizerou, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Pivovar Kl�ter (Pivovary Lobkowicz);"bottle. Decent head, full lager taste. Good balance of malts and hops. Better than the ""dark beer"". Not what I expected for a winter brew, but good."

Kl�ter Winter Lager;Hradi�t� nad Jizerou, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Pivovar Kl�ter (Pivovary Lobkowicz);Not sure why such a low rating on this beer! It is a nice Czech Lager! Poured clear and crisp with a nice layer of foam that alsted the whole beer. Nice hops, with good bittering at the back. Extremely clear and light effervescence. Not just a good winter lager, but good for summer too!
Red Lion Northern Light;Watertown, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Red Lion Brew Pub & Restaurant;Nice malty nose for a light, light gold in colour and smooth maltiness with nice hops in the mouth.

Rocky River Brewery Oktoberfest;Sevierville, Tennessee, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rocky River Brewery & Grille (TN);aroma- sugar, caramel, dough. pours deep amber with about a finger length off white head. palate is creamy, medium body. taste is roasted malt, caramel, dough, almond/peanut with a slight hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste.
Rocky River Brewery Oktoberfest;Sevierville, Tennessee, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rocky River Brewery & Grille (TN);Golden beer with a white dissipating head. Aroma of hops and alcohol. Sweet and sweat initial flavor that turns bitter and stays with you. Light and dry on the palate.
Rocky River Brewery Oktoberfest;Sevierville, Tennessee, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rocky River Brewery & Grille (TN);Draught: The beer poured a clear golden color. There was a white, full head that dissapated quickly. Some lacing down the sides of the glass. There was a rather bland aroma, with nothing really distinguishing about it. There was a mild hop bite with some maltiness, but no sweetness to it. OK for a session beer. Nothing special about it at all.
Archers Golden Train;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask handpump at the Swan in the Rushes, Loughborough. Clear golden colour with a creamy white head. Malty with a long bitter finish. Decent bitter.
Archers Golden Train;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Stillage at the Memorial Hall, Northwich 20/09/2003 Clear golden coloured bitter with floral aromas. Very smooth on the palate with a lasting hoppy finish.
Archers Golden Train;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Dec, 2004 JDW, Rochester. Pale malt beer of little character. Pleasant enough, but ordinary and a bit dull. [2.7] April, 2006 Rising Sun, Kemsing. A lagerish golden beer. Wheat head. Bland. Fairly clean. Lager hops, but not many of them them. All round rather dull. [2.4]
Archers Golden Train;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Conditioned (gravity), Royal Standard, Wooburn Common, Bucks. A tasty golden beer, with a lingering bitterness. Nothing spectacular, but a great pint.
Archers Golden Train;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Conditioned at The George, Barford St. Michael, Oxon. Golden amber beer with white head. A malty sweet golden beer, floral peppery hops with a lingering bitterness. A very decent beer, hints of gooseberry within the body.
Archers Golden Train;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Light copper colour - not as golden as the name would suggest. Plenty of body, but like many Archers beers in my experience, a little too much residual sweetness on the finish. The number of one-off, occasional and special brews that Archers is producing is nothing short of bewildering and, without a company website to clarify matters, I can't help feeling that here is a little gimmickry at work. Perfectly acceptable beer, but nothing special. Handpump, Market Porter, London SE1, October 2003
Archers His Lordships Whisky Beer;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask, Hinckley Fest 08. Dark brown like cola with a small head. Aromas are molasses and weetabix with light whisky grain. Some burnt notes. Flavours are toffee malts with citrus. Earthy hops with herbal notes. Vinous and warming with not so much whisky as in the aroma.
Archers His Lordships Whisky Beer;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask at The Frothblowers Arms, Salisbury. Nice beer. Whiskey sort of got by me. Very drinkable bitter. (Note from 10/8/2004)
Archers His Lordships Whisky Beer;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask@1st Hinckley Beer Festival, 2008. Very dark brown beer with a slightly reddish edge. The aroma is very lightly roasted, and the flavour is lightly roasted and dry with a large element of whisky flavour. Overall a reasonable combination beer.
Archers His Lordships Whisky Beer;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask @ Market Porter, A nice Clean bitter not exceptional but not bad. The RCH Steam Fair was a better session beer.
Archers His Lordships Whisky Beer;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask at Bon Accord, Glasgow. Little bit thin for the ABV. Tastes a bit like a Scottish 80/-.
Archers His Lordships Whisky Beer;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Archers (Evan Evans);Yet another Archers occasional/special beer. Sampled in the Market Porter, Southwark, which seemed to be doing a dozen or more Archers beers over a period of a week or so. This was the best of those that I tasted. If it actually has whisky in it, I could not detect it, but what I did find was a full bodied mid-brown beer with good balance and a good clean finish. 5.2% alcohol but drinks a lot easier than that. Very nice. Handpump, October 2003.
Bartrams Beer Elsie Bub;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bartrams;Cask Handpump at the Bull�s Head, Burslem 04/11/2006 Some hop aroma. Golden coloured and fruity with a crisp and bitter malt finish.
Bartrams Beer Elsie Bub;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bartrams;Bottled.One of the better ones from this brewery.Honey smoothness dominates with traces of citrus.Just a taste of spiceness.Well balanced and well worth searching out.
Bartrams Beer Elsie Bub;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bartrams;Bottle Conditioned. Orange amber, no head, little condition. Fairly single minded beer, narshish bitter notes with a little peachy notes but not well consructed. Overall disapointing.
Bartrams Beer Elsie Bub;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bartrams;Bottle.Dark yellow,no head,some malt,twigs,wet clothes,no thanks............
Bartrams Beer Elsie Bub;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bartrams;Bottled. On the whole I�ve been pretty unimpressed with the Batram�s. I�ve tasted many a home-brew better then these beers they�ve knocked out. Foggy orange colour with a thin, sharp white head. Sharp sour aroma. Bitter/sweat taste with no backbone at all. No bitterness, no hops. Poor them. (5,2,5,2,9:2.3) Re-rated: 6/July/04. Had a second bottle of this thanks to chris_o and I must say. This one was richer and smoother and rather nice.
Bartrams Beer Elsie Bub;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bartrams;Bartrams produces a very wide range of bottle-conditioned beers, most of which are rarely, if ever, available on draft, so you will have to track down the bottled versions if you want to try them. Barwells, a food store in Bury St Edmunds, stocks most of them. Beer Elsie Bub is brewed with Fuggles & Goldings hops and flavoured with honey and coriander. Quite pale coloured and the flavourings are fairly subtle. Plenty of hoppy bitterness to balance things up. Very nice. Bottled, October 2003
Via Maria Dave;Holland, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Via Maria Trattoria;Draft at the brewpub. Was a brown pour, with a finger of creamy white head. Nose was spice and hops. Very crisp, and some grapefruit flavors. Very impressed with the brew, even though the service was terrible at the place. Reminded me alot of a nice barley wine.
Via Maria Dave;Holland, Michigan, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Via Maria Trattoria;Cloudy reddish/orange - muddy. Clear, crisp citrusy hops in the nose - nice and fruity, slightly candyish. The body is nicely bitter with hints of citrus and fruit. A touch of roasty hops in the middle rounded by a firm sweet malt presence. The hops are big carrying into the finish. A bit spritzy but nicely balanced and bitter. I think probably the best at this brewpub.
Flossmoor Station Express ESB;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Nice copper hue with solid white head and moderate lace. The aroma is hoppy (both tradional and a hint of pine), fruity (apple and pear), toasted malts, biscuit, and dry dusty yeast esters. The taste is pretty good really, I enjoyed the interplay between the malts and bitter hops (even though more hop character would have been nice). A citric fruitiness and buttery biscuit undertone for support. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth and a touch creamy. A solid ESB, ratebeerian worthy. Nice 1st effort from the new brewmaster.
Flossmoor Station Express ESB;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Just a typical ale, with very little bitterness. Perhaps true to style, though I think even a UK bitter would have more hops than this. This was a touch sweet and had a nice butterscotch aroma.
Flossmoor Station Express ESB;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Mild malt nose. Good hops and bitterness. Fairly good body. Seemed true to style, but lacking any real character.

Flossmoor Station Express ESB;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Good, middle of the road ESB. Slight sweetness, some metallic hop bitterness, touch of butterscotch.
Flossmoor Station Express ESB;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Deep copper with a thin whispy head. Aroma of lightly roasted caramel malts. Body has enough caramel sweetness and a pleasant bitterness. Finishes lightly dry and bittersweet. A good ESB.
Flossmoor Station Express ESB;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draft. Here�s the first Special by new Brewmaster Matt VanWyk: perhaps a �safe� choice, but then again, I don�t believe FS has ever offered a bitter. Re-sampled, Jan. 04. I took a growler home six weeks after its debut, and find it to be mellowed, picking up some earthiness and esters. I believe I caught some hard water taste from Burton salts. Becomes nice and more complex as I pour ouot more.
Dragonmead Excalibur Barley Wine;Warren, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dragonmead Brewery;From notes. Had this on tap at the 2016 MGB Summer Beer Fest. The pour is a dirty amber gold color with a decently thick white head that falls to a dense cap, leaving a pretty good lace. The aroma is interesting. It�s got a Belgian yeasty thing happening, and I�m not okay with this. There is a lot of booze and a huge hop presence. There is a light fruitiness to it, but it�s almost got a tart bite to it. I�m not really sure what to make of it. The flavor is a little more bracing. There is almost a traditional wine thing happening that needs to be addressed. I�m not okay with it. The mouth feel is thin and light with a bright carbonation and a really bitter, bordering sour, fruitiness that just doesn�t belong. This one needs help.
Dragonmead Excalibur Barley Wine;Warren, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dragonmead Brewery;Draft at brewery. 04.22.2010. Pours amber, clear, light head. Nose of slight fruitiness, a bit of sourness. Tastes sweet, fruity, slight spice. Oily mouthfeel.
Dragonmead Excalibur Barley Wine;Warren, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dragonmead Brewery;Sample at the brewpub. Pours a cloudy amber-gold color with a thick and frothy white head that evaporates slowly. Rings of lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of malt and ripe fruits. Full-bodied with flavors of caramel malt, citrus, and a touch of grassy hops in the background. The finish is fruity and slightly boozy. Decent Barley Wine overall.
Dragonmead Excalibur Barley Wine;Warren, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dragonmead Brewery;On draft at at pub . Pours clear amber not much head rather boozy and sweet
Dragonmead Excalibur Barley Wine;Warren, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dragonmead Brewery;this fruity thing tasted like watermelon......................................................
Dragonmead Excalibur Barley Wine;Warren, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dragonmead Brewery;Pours a nice amber gold with WAY too thick white head, bartender said that this batch was way overcarbonated and has been a problem. Aroma strong of mostly malt, caramel, and sweetness. Flavor is really no surprise compared to the aroma with the addition of some light spices. Pretty good, but I am just not a barley wine fan I guess.
Dragonmead Excalibur Barley Wine;Warren, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at Dragonmead 3-13-09. Poured cloudy amber some lacing. Smelled of thick malt, some alcohol, and fruity. Tasted very sweet, some light fruit, like apple and grape, some dark fruit, like prune, cherry, fermented berry, and raisin. Decent alcohol presence. Very sticky body.
Dragonmead Excalibur Barley Wine;Warren, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at the Dragonmead Brew Pub. Poured a medium and cloudy golden color with a very larged sized, frothy white head. Aromas of caramel, citrus, floral, and herbal. Tastes of caramel, citrus, the same herbalness, and fruity. Light alcohol in the finish but overall very well hidden.
Dragonmead Excalibur Barley Wine;Warren, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dragonmead Brewery;Clear amber pour with a ring of white lace. Aroma of caramel and hops. Flavor of hops and burnt caramel with a bitter finish. The palate is light an oily with soft carbonation. Average.
Dragonmead Excalibur Barley Wine;Warren, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dragonmead Brewery;Draft... Clear, deep amber ale with a huge, off-white head. Terrific retention. Nose of toffee, fuzzy fruit and pine. Earthy, sweet flavor. Nicely bittered, but the hops don�t cut too deeply into the malt. Full-bodied and syrupy with subtle carbonation. Sweet, boozy finish. Dries out at the wee end.
Emmetts Oatmeal Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Taste: toasted toasted dark malts,lactose, oats, cocoa, creamy mouthfeel. rich semi sweet chocolate malt toasted milk nose. Black/brown hue, semi clear, tan foamy head, nice ring of lace. Medium/full body. Good after dinner ale.
Emmetts Oatmeal Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On tap at Emmett�s, pours black with a thin light brown head and some spotty lacing, the aroma was of more chocolate and cocoa more than anything, the flavor had light amount of chocolate on the front end and a creamy finish, still kind of boring though and nothing really jumps out, meh.
Emmetts Oatmeal Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Interesting. Somewhat warm. Has a burnt flavor, slightly carmel. Sweet. Very silky and unusual. I think I like this a lot. Had this at Emmetts in downers grove from draft, part of a flight.
Emmetts Oatmeal Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Emmetts Brewing Co.;The last one of the day and a big pint and a half of it as well! Pitch black with a small tan head. Not motor oil thick, just enough density to make it fit. Some sweet roasted malts on the nose, i think maybe a littel ginger bread or something too. Taste was full and creamy, went down solid and came out a liquid. Nice beer and nice experience at Emmetts!
Emmetts Oatmeal Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Emmetts Brewing Co.;A dark black pour with a great nitrogen pour look to it and a semi-dense tan head. Aroma has a lot of roasted malt character, light nuttiness and is rounded out by some chocolate and coffee notes. Flavor has a chocolate not up front and then moves into a bitter roasted bite with some coffee notes at the end. Density of the brew is a bit light in my opinion but the carbonation matches the style. Overall not too bad but just seems to be lacking some density to make it feel as creamy as it looks.
Emmetts Oatmeal Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Emmetts Brewing Co.;"11/16/2007: Emmett�s Oatmeal Stout has chocolate and lots of raosted malt in its aroma. The beer is very dark brown and clear with ruby highlights areound the edge. There is a lasting, foamy brown head. The flavor contains roasted malt, char, chocolate, and hints of coffee. This beer has a smooth, soft, creamy texture, but needs more body. Sample (draught; 4.6% ABV) at Emmett�s Ale House in Oswego, IL. Rating #26 for this beer."
Emmetts Oatmeal Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Emmetts Brewing Co.;A strong heady beer, with a strong chocolately taste. Reminds me of strong cafe mocha with a full creamy head
Emmetts Oatmeal Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Sampler at the brewery. Black, nitrogen pour. Creamy texture, heavy coffee, and heavy roasted malts throughout the palate. Very similar to the New Glarus Road Slush I just had- like an espresso stout. Good.
Emmetts Oatmeal Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Pour is ruddy bwonish black with a sticky tight bubbled brown head...rich roasty aroma with some chocolate and coffee...a bit more chocolatey...taste is subtle sweet chocolate up front with some coffee bitterness coming out...no real roasty flavor...
Emmetts Oatmeal Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Half pint Downers Grove - Subtle aroma of milk, oatmeal, roasted chocolate malts and a little coffee. Pours black with a big nitro head and great lacing. Flavor matches aroma and does get better as it warms, but never gets strong enough for me. Palate is creamy with a sticky finish. Another stout killed by nitro.
Emmetts Pub Draught Ale;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - English;Emmetts Brewing Co.;I believe this was wahat they called scotch ale when i was there. it has a bitter taste on the front end and a sweet taste one the back end. the color is a deep red. definately worth a sample if your inthe area.
Emmetts Dunkel Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;pour was a cloudy hazy light brown with small off white head aromas of spices,fruits and malts flavors of bananas,cloves and hops
Emmetts Dunkel Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Picked up a growler of this recently and drank the next day. Color is a cloudy/muddy orange -brown color with medium carbonation and a thick off-white head which quickly recedes to almost nothing. The aroma of the beer is very heavy of cloves with a secondary aroma of bananas. The flavor has a bread flavor to start which quickly moves into a very strong clove flavor. Some wheat notes as well as banana notes make their way though at the end of the taste. Mouth feel is a bit lite and has a bit watery. Overall the flavor is too dominate of cloves for my taste and takes away from the beers good characters.
Emmetts Dunkel Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Draught. 11/2007. Murky, opaque brown, almost purple looking with a thin off-white head. A rich banana and clove aroma with a touch of yeasty malt. Flavor is full with a roast overtone riding on rich yeasty flavors. Finishes tart and dry. Smooth and full bodied.
Emmetts Dunkel Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On tap on my 25th birthday at Paletine. Hazy brown, good lacing and a rim of head. Nose is mostly malts. The taste is very very sour with some yeast here and there. Lots of bannana esters and spices. Overall pretty good, just not really my style for some reason.
Emmetts Dunkel Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Had it at the Palatine location, which had like 5 seasonals on tap. I didn�t really care for the pour. Served in a weizen, it was dirty water brown with a somewhat flat head that didn�t fill the glass. Aroma was pretty nice...a huge sniff of banana and some other esters. Flavor, however, was a little different. Kind of sour and bitter not in a hoppy way but in a lemony way. Lacked a lot of esters of a traditional hefe and most of the bready, chocolate, nutty flavors of a dunkel. Overall, decent but not above average like every other Emmetts I�ve had. In a way, a little disappointing.
Emmetts Dunkel Weizen;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Emmetts Brewing Co.;"The listing at Emmett�s Ale House in Downers Grove, IL, listed it as ""Dunkle Weizen."" This both smells and tastes kin of life an old Good Humor banana popcycle. It pours a deep orange color with a good frothy white head, and also adds some spiciness to the aroma. It�s very soft in the mouth, full of banana, some grassiness, and spices. Clean, lightly sweet finish. Emmett�s Ale House, Downers Grove, IL"
Emmetts Barrel Aged Imperial Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Draft @ FoBAB 2009, Chicago, IL. Pours a dark brown almost black color with a small tan head. Has a roasted malty dark chocolate and bourbon aroma. Sweetish roasted malty chocolate and coffee flavor with some hints of bourbon. Has a sweetish roasted malty dark chocolate finish with hints of bourbon and vanilla in the aftertaste.
Emmetts Barrel Aged Imperial Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Emmetts Brewing Co.;2006 Vintage - bottle 140/254. Opaque brown with a thin cocoa colored head, viscous lacing. Strong devils food cake aroma with evident woody barrel character. Very full rich aroma. Smoky char flavor, nutty brown sugar, and barrel characteristics all mingle in a flavor that is complex and nice but not overwhelming. Palate is a bit oily and thin. Rating for second bottle sampled July 2010: Bottle. Aroma is potent, dry, and redolent of oak and whisky. Opaque dark brown with just a wisp of tan head and a thin line that clings to the edge of the glass. Flat, super bitter roast with an acidic oaky note. A nice sipper. 7 4 8 3 Overall it seems the aroma suffered slightly in aging, but the flavor held up and perhaps slightly improved.
Emmetts Barrel Aged Imperial Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On tap at FoBAB 5. Poured black with a light ring and a dusting of deep brown head. The aroma picked up roasted darker chocolates with a very sweet bourbon presence.. a lot of barrel character, and fairly well-integrated. The flavor picked up sweet bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate at the core with even more bourbon and vanilla toward the finish.. full, malty, and quite tasty. Heavier-bodied with a nice, sweet barrel influence.. moderate roast worked as well.. fairly complex with a toasty, boozy finish. This was good, but came nowhere near the non-BA stuff.
Emmetts Barrel Aged Imperial Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Emmetts Brewing Co.;"Bottle #65 (out of 274) from a special bottling done by the Emmett�s folk in the Winter of 2006: This pours out of the bottle like dark brown motor oil. The ""head"" is merely some big bubbles that might actually have been caused by the pouring. Eventually, a thin tan ring appears around the glass. The aroma is dark roasted malt, Bourbon, aniseed, abd alcohol. The flavor is more complex having the additions of molasses, burnt brown sugar, bittersweet chocolate, and coffee grounds. Nicely blended. I should have bought two bottles. Emmett�s Ale House, Downers Grove, IL"
Emmetts Barrel Aged Imperial Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Impenetrable ebony pour with no visible head or carbonation. The nose was intensley roasted malt. Sweet coffee, espresso, brown sugar, molasses and bourbon are all there. The mouthfeel seemed pretty light for an imperial, I think.
Emmetts Barrel Aged Imperial Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Emmetts Brewing Co.;#909On tap at the 4th anual Festival of Wood and barrel Aged Beer festival at GI Wriglyville Nov 4th, 2006. Now when I found out that Emmett�s, one of my favourite breweries around Chicago, was going to be at the FOBAB I was hoping that they would bring this. To make a long story short I was out of town when this was released in December 2005 and showed up at the pub in West Dundee about 6 hours or so after it went dry. To say the least I was crushed. But was relieved to hear that they had some left over that they were going to release at a later date. This was it. Totally black with no head. Almost looked like syrup with no carbonaton. The nose had lots and lots of bourbon with just a hint of vanilla. The taste was flat, almost excessively sweet, some hints of chocolate but mostly alcohol vapors and bourbon just a hint of vanilla. Too one directional and flat. This had to have been better when it was first released. And if they plan on doing this again I will be there to re-rate.
Emmetts Barrel Aged Imperial Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Emmetts Brewing Co.;i like these guys so i feel bad trashing this, but... sampled at barrel-aged brewfest. pitch black, small dissipating head. some bourbon. taste is very empty. watered-down, some tacky artificial bourbon flavor. so watery. disappointing.
Emmetts Barrel Aged Imperial Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On tap: Aroma of chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and light bourbon. Dark brown with no transparency and a minimal beige ring for a head. Chocolate and vanilla up front with some mild coffee in the background. Coffee increases in the finish with moderate bourbon that is a little hot and a little overdone.
Emmetts Barrel Aged Imperial Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Draft: Ebony with chestnut hues. Puffy light chocolate foam. Lovely nose of black chocolate soaking in bourbon. Hints of shredded coconut, gritty fudge, and toffee. Peak condition with silky, velvety soft carbonation. Soft flavors of vanilla and coconut cushions the sharp tannic bite. Flavorsome blend of charred wood adds immediate dryness with an accompaniment of deep pie crust and burnt malt. Immense oak dryness prevails throughout, absorbing the perfect level of bourbon sweetness. Fluffy malt center pillars the firm dryness. Harsh, soil-laden finish shows a decadent blend of matchsticks and espresso chased with a delayed culmination of burnt chocolate and toasted oak. Are you kidding? A bourbon-aged brew which, for once, shows some restraint? This is what wood-aged Imperial Stout is all about. Lots of toasty oak flavors, tannins, and, overall, more bourbon cask nuances than sugary bourbon sweetness and alcohol prominence, which seemingly pervades 99% of others of its ilk. Absolutely wonderful.
Emmetts Barrel Aged Imperial Stout;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Emmetts Brewing Co.;"Draught; 2004 Festival of Barrel Aged Beers (Chicago): Opaque, jet black. Bourbon vanilla aroma, stronger on the sweet side than the whiskey side�light Baker�s chocolate, vanilla and a touch of burnt coffee to boot. Dark, candish bourbon flavours with milk chocolate � finish has some wood and bitter cellulose. Creamy caramel and a vinous coating lingers in the mouth leaving one to believe the truth, this is a solid imperial stout�"
Emmetts India Pale Ale;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;IPA;Emmetts Brewing Co.;a decent ipa. clightly citruscy and hoppy. very easy to drink. pours orage in color with thin white head. had a draft pour at emmett�s in palatine.
Emmetts India Pale Ale;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;IPA;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Had this one on tap at Emmett�s new brewpub in Oswego, IL. Copper-amber with a medium head. Mild nops on nose, but a hoppy finish to the drink. Not bad.
Emmetts India Pale Ale;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;IPA;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Draft at Downers Grove. Hop aroma is well balanced with a malt backbone. Dark copper in color with a good sized off-white head. Lots of lacing. Bitterness from the hops is full but not overbearing and lingers pleasantly. Good easy drinking, yet tasty IPA.
Emmetts India Pale Ale;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;IPA;Emmetts Brewing Co.;From the tap this pours a slightly hazy copper/orange with a large head that vanishes quickly. Still, nice lacing is done throughout the drink. The aroma�s a bit lighter than I would like but has all of the proper elements, a sweet caramel base with grapefruit, pine, lemon zest, and a trace of orange blossoms. The hoppy bitterness builds as you drink, attaining a point that makes this hop-head happy, but it fades a bit quickly in the finish. All in all, a decent IPA. Emmett�s Ale House, Downers Grove, IL
Emmetts India Pale Ale;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;IPA;Emmetts Brewing Co.;"#1021, On tap at the brewery in Downers Grove Illinois. A.K.A. ""India Pale Ale."" Served in a big pint glass. Hazy medium dark hazy copper color (Lighter as compared to the Victory) and a significant off white to dusty white head that was foamy and long lasting. The nose has a lot of metal or copper to it with some strong sweeter hops. The taste is very hop strong but only after a smooth, chewy and grainy malts. (As compared to the Victory the malts are much stronger but more grainy in a way) There is something especially thick about this, grains and barley in and out with a so-bitter-its-sweetness to it. I am unsure about the alcohol concentration but it felt near the 8% range. Definately worth the wait, I wish that they would brew this more often."
Emmetts India Pale Ale;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;IPA;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Had this one on draught in Dundee, Illinois. WOW! Exactly what I like in an IPA. Deep copper color, thin head, the hops pack a whollop in the nose of roses and spice, and in the flavor, strong and bitter and just right. Ideal!
Emmetts India Pale Ale;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;IPA;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Its all in the hops! storng floral notes, a very interesting IPA. they get thier hops from the pacific northwest and thats true to all thier styles. they all have a floral bouquet. all the beers are very drinkable. i would classify them as your typical english, scoth and irish styles with the special floral hops.
Dixie Light;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dixie Brewing Co.;The initial taste is optimistic, like buying your romantic interest a beignet with lots of sugar, but the palate is a disaster, like when you cough, they walk out, and you are left staring at a powdered sugar silhouette of your romantic interest on the wall.
Dixie Light;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dixie Brewing Co.;The aroma is light malt and grassy hops not unlike a typical lager. The appearance is straw gold with a smallish head. The palate is thin. The taste is like the aroma but somewhat richer than expected. Overall it's not going to win a lot of competitions but for a light beer it's pretty darn good.
Dixie Light;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dixie Brewing Co.;Dixie Light :Light in calories with a floral nose. I find it flavorful and like some of the bigger lite or light beer brands
Dixie Light;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dixie Brewing Co.;Aroma is grains/sweetness. The flavor is grains//malts, slight chemical harshness and a sweetish finish.
Dixie Light;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dixie Brewing Co.;12 fl oz bottle. Pours light hazy yellow. Small white head. Aroma is grainy and grassy. Bitter, slight grassy. Mild herbal. Grassy and dry bitter finish.
Dixie Light;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dixie Brewing Co.;This is very light, and it's now (as of August, 2017), brewed in Memphis, Tennessee (City Brewing) for Dixie Brewing Co. of Louisiana. Smells of sickly sweetness and wet straw. Taste of paper, sickly sweetness, sourdough, and water. Mouthfeel is light and thin, and the new (old) Dixie Light finishes sloppy and bad. RJT
Dixie Light;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dixie Brewing Co.;This beer is gross. Tastes like a heavy swamp of hell. Golden pour at kingfish in New Orleans. Yuck
Dixie Light;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dixie Brewing Co.;No. There are enough light pale lagers out there. Dixie didn�t need to do this. Not a heap of aroma, flavor, body. Dixie should be developing more Voodoos. From RAYBOY01�s Fridge
Dixie Light;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dixie Brewing Co.;I just love light beer, It is my essence. It is my total being. I see the light and I know I'm alright. I chug them and beg for more, knowing that there's always room. Yummy Yummy!
Dixie Light;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dixie Brewing Co.;hmm, well this wasnt good. probably golden, but i never bothered to look, probably smelled like ass but i forget. Tasted much like skunky flavered nothing. nough said.

Flying Fish Big Fish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Fish Brewing Company;It's different than most IPAs. It doesn't have much hop or bite which is a nice change but it's a little watery. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Flying Fish Big Fish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Fish Brewing Company;2006 bottle - pours amber brown white head - nose and taste of toffee, caramel and earth - medium body
Flying Fish Big Fish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Fish Brewing Company;Apparently nobody�s had this in 4 years.. let�s see how it�s doing. 2006 vintage, 750mL bottle. Opened with very little fanfare. Poured murky medium brown with a dusting and some looser bubbles of beige head. The aroma picked up warm, rich, well-aged darker fruits, caramel, and molasses, with light biscuit and oxidation accents.. the hops, as expected, were nowhere to be found, but that was OK.. well-balanced and well-aged. The flavor found aged caramel, molasses, and biscuity malts at the core, with a kiss of raw brown sugar more toward the back.. some tart, broken-down notes and light fruity yeast around.. finished warm with quite a bit of yeasty character and warm malts. Heavier-bodied with light carbonation on the palate.. slick feel on the middle, and a tad tacky on the finish.. I�m guessing it was better several years ago, but I�m glad I got the chance.
Flying Fish Big Fish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Fish Brewing Company;Poured amber with off white head. Aroma of fruit and caramel. Some fruit mixed in to this overly sweet heavy brew. Thick.
Flying Fish Big Fish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Fish Brewing Company;750ml bottle. Pours caramel with a thin white head. Smells of citrus, resiny, caramel. Tastes bitter and caramelly with some pepper and spice. Subdued,
Flying Fish Big Fish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Fish Brewing Company;75th Rating of this beer. 750ml bottle via trade with Adrian910ss, shared with Cyn. Pours cloudy amber with a thin tan head. Nose has a great citrussy aroma, with some caramel in it also. Taste is sweet, very fresh and quite nice. I like this BW, its not incredible but its damn good.
Flying Fish Big Fish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Fish Brewing Company;25.4 oz bottle. Hazed orange brown with a light beige skin. Nose is grassy caramel with some musty orange. Taste is similar with hints of cinnamon and candi. Soapy with alcohol but still tasty. Mild carb, medium light, a bit sticky.
Flying Fish Big Fish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Fish Brewing Company;Bottle ala Pitonka, Thanks. Lightly hazed light umber color with a small stable lid of light taupe bubbles. Lots of fruit in the aromas with melon, pears, raisins, cherries, and apricots. Mild hint of citric hops to help freshing things up. Solid, but somewhat stoic scents. LIght pale malt flavors mingle with some ruby red grapefruit. Lots of hops flavors in this one. Alcohol is well hidden and only slightly warming. My mind starts to wander (a bit more than its normal roam) and I think about DFH 120, 3F Behemoth and even a few of the Fullers Vintage ales. Actually quite light in feel. I catch some coconut in the finish along with some light melon. Linger seems follows with more of the finishing flavors and a light lime zest bite. I think I popped the top of this one at the right time. Still plenty of hops, Not overly sweet and just a nice barley wine. This is not the strong one to be had with a cigar, rather a delicate one that should be savored with a good book or as the bottle suggest, good friends. A near perfect sports weekend in Wisconsin celebratory brew. GO BUCKY, PACK and BREWERS. Thanks again Andre�.
Flying Fish Big Fish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Fish Brewing Company;Hazy amber/orange color. Fruity citrus hop aroma. Sweet with good hop bitter balance. Malty, rich, thich, and chewy. Very good beer.
Flying Fish Big Fish;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Fish Brewing Company;Growler courtesy of my secret santa. Shared with a bunch of friends. Pours a thin head that recedes at a moderate pace. Decent carbonation for a barleywine more than a year old and has been sitting in a growler for 2 months. Malty aroma with some caramel malts, sprucy hops aroma and a bit of roastyness. Color is a murky bright copper orange. Predominantly malty aroma with some caramel, bitter grapefruit hops and roasted malts. Full bodied but still a little thinner mouthfeel than I expected. Noticable alcohol presence. Finishes sweet and hoppy with a lingering bitterness and alcohol presence. A pretty darn good BW. Thanks to john_adam2002 for gracing me with this fine brew and many others for my secret santa.

Dogwood Winter Ale 2003 (Special Edition);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Courtesy of Blazer06. It pours ruby deep red with mocha head. The aroma has some spiciness from yeast and winter like spices but seems to roll quickly into full rich sweet dark fruity esters. The taste is even more so with the dark fruitiness with smooth sweet blueberries and ripe dark grapes mixing with thick sticky malts and smooth mellow spiciness. Nice.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2003 (Special Edition);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);More spice in this winter. Pretty tasty bue a little thin. The aroma was pretty nice but I lost about a fourth of the bottle due to gussing.

Dogwood Winter Ale 2003 (Special Edition);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);12oz bottle via trade with goldtwins - thanks Larry! - Pours dark brown almost black with a nice tan foamy head. Aromas much like the 03 non spiced but you can pick up nutmeg, cinnamon, lots of chocolate, caramel, and a little alcohol. Flavor is dominated by chocolate, nuts, caramel, and a good amount of nutmeg. Also some raisin though. Palate is smooth and soft with full body and a dry finish. Pretty tasty..
Dogwood Winter Ale 2003 (Special Edition);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Bottle (1litre #437of2500). Shared with Sammy and DrJay, Sammy�s bottle. Huge gush on opening, I contained it and bled the swing-top cap for a couple of minutes before it was safe to pour ... which was maddening, because this one smelled great!. Poured very murky deep mahogany - some floaties, who cares - with a large foamy-creamy lasting off-white head. Rich, sweet, yeasty aroma of apples, apricots, sweet mulling spices, and yards of sweet yeasty roast caramel malt - terrific, this smelled like an honest-to-God Belgian to me. The taste was just as sweet, yeasty and fruity as the nose, but there was a building counterbalancing bitterness to it - like biting into an apple core - and some nice eartip warming alcohol too. Had a smooth, thick, sticky-syrupy mouthfeel, perhaps a tad light-bodied, but overall one of my favourites of the evening, a real winter warmer! Thanks again for sharing, Sammy - and are sure this isn�t the 2003 Special Edition?
Dogwood Winter Ale 2003 (Special Edition);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);"thanks to Aracauna for this one! This has ""cellared"" in the �fridge for maybe the last year. Poured with a small off-white head that fell quickly. The body was muddy and full of chunky particulates. Root beer in color and aroma. Lightly sweet and spicy and delivers smoothly with a medium body. Not bad as the spices were well balanced and their presence was just about right."

Dogwood Winter Ale 2003 (Special Edition);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);Courtesy of Pailhead. Medium/dark hazy brown with minimal head. Aroma is all clove with faint toasted malt background. Flavor is again all clove with a slight sourness in the finish. Enjoyable, but spice is maybe a tad overthetop.
Dogwood Winter Ale 2003 (Special Edition);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Flavored - Other;Dogwood Brewing Company (GA);I�m not 100% sure this is what I had last night on bottle brought by a ratebeerian, but it seems close. Bottle was numbered, 788/2500. Nose was very interesting and complex, cider crossed with a touch of.. fish?! Odd, but good. Mouth was malty and complex as well, quite good. Too bad I won�t get to try this again as they�re out of business.

White Star Capstan Full Strength;Southampton, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;White Star;Bottle conditioned, 500ml. Dark brown with white head.

White Star Capstan Full Strength;Southampton, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;White Star;Dark brown, foggy, beige head. I think the brewery need to be disinfected because this is not the first time I try an infected beer from them. If you look behind the sour infected sensation you find some chocolate notes which promises that the recipe is not bad.
White Star Capstan Full Strength;Southampton, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;White Star;Bottle conditioned, from Beer Cellar in Lincoln. Deep chestnut brown, lasting thick creamy beige head and gentle condition. Gentle roasted barley, faint woody tartness and a hint of cow dung in the nose. Quite tart in the mouth, with a dry fruitiness and gentle coffee notes. Not much in the way of body to hide the alcohol. Finish is thin and slightly sour with a touch of roasted dryness and warming retronasal alcohol.

White Star Capstan Full Strength;Southampton, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;White Star;This is the third bottled beer I have tried from White Star and non of them have impressed. It was slightly cloudy and not too threatening to drink considering its strength, Slight sourness and overall not really pleasant.
White Star Capstan Full Strength;Southampton, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;White Star;BCA. Upon opening lost 1/2 pint to gushing. Some chocolate and roasty malts but hidden behind sour yeastiness. Thin body with unpleasant bite and overcarbonation points to an infection. The underlying beer seemed pleasant enough but White Star seem to have some quality control problems (bottle 6 months within BBE).

Durham Oyster Stout;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Stout;County Durham Brewing;Draught at Starfish. Pours a dark ruby-brown, almost black, with an average size lasting creamy off-white head and good lacing on the glass. Very mild aroma, there was barely anything there, served too cold really but I detected some roasted malt and light coffee. Flavour of lightly roasted malt, light coffee, a touch of smokiness and a good amount of saltiness. Creamy mouthfeel. Medium+ bodied. Quite good and enjoyable.
Durham Oyster Stout;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Stout;County Durham Brewing;Draught (nitro?) pint in a shaker glass at Starfish in Toronto, August 31, 2010 - also enjoying pints at the same time were blankboy and garthicus. And cheers to Rob, our server - thank you and long time no see. Been looking for this rating for a long time, finally got around to nailing it down. Mostly opaque ruby-brown with a creamy lasting small tan milky-looking head. Mild aroma - roast coffee malt, a bit sweet, a hint of saltiness. Taste is .... a salty Guinness, really - creamy, nitro sting, probably a power-of-suggestion saltiness, a hint of lactose. Creamy, smooth, frothy mouthfeel, light carbonation, quick-finishing, leaving a dry slightly sweet mocha aftertaste. Nice.
Durham Oyster Stout;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Stout;County Durham Brewing;Finally managed to have it at The Starfish. Appearance: Pitch black, small creamy head. Aroma: light cream, a tiny amount of smoke, lactose. Flavour: smokey, coffee, creamy mouth feel, a little salty oyster-ness and a long bitter finish. Beautiful.
Durham Oyster Stout;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Stout;County Durham Brewing;Draught at Starfish. FINALLY managed to track down this elusive beauty, only brewed when Patrick from Starfish has saved up enough oyster liquor to make a batch. Dark ruby-black with a creamy and persistent tan head. Great aroma of toasted malt, cocoa and a hint of oyster (trust me, it works). Fairly full bodied, fuller than I remember Durham Blak Katt being. Excellent flavour - the full malt, coffee and cocoa elements are given an extra edge by the slight oyster notes in the finish. Went well with some oysters and other seafood, of course. A really fine pint!
Durham Oyster Stout;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Stout;County Durham Brewing;"[1852-20081108] Tap. Rich chocolate roasted malt aroma has a hint of sea salt.

Durham Oyster Stout;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Stout;County Durham Brewing;Draft @ Starfish as Patrick�s Oyster Stout. Ruby tinged black body with a creamy beige head. Mild roasty aroma, muted sweet malt. Creamy palate is exquisite, with the head almost a lighlty whipped milk in texture. Flavour is a touch muted at times but mild roast and plenty of pleasant chocolate notes throughout are quite nice. Nice accompaniment to some PEI oysters. Thought this was pretty similar to the Black Katt, but I actually preferred this to a sample of the BK later in the evening.
Durham Oyster Stout;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Stout;County Durham Brewing;On tap, Beer Bistro. I�m a big fan of the normal stout from Durham, so I was wondering how this would turn out, especially as I am no fan of oysters. Thankfully, the additional flavour made quite a nice beer. It looks the same, pitch black, but the head was far creamier looking and thick. Taste was extremely creamy and sweet too - a real dessert beer, more so than some chocolate stouts I�ve had. The saltiness and oyster flavour was present but balanced nicely - this could have been really easy to mess up, but they�ve made a really nice beer here. Just not something I could have more than one of at a time, but a lovely treat.
Durham Oyster Stout;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Stout;County Durham Brewing;Draught, BeerBistroAlmost black. Strongly fruity, over top of sublime roastiness and chocolate. Sweet overall. A little too sweet, really, but a solid effort.
Durham Oyster Stout;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Stout;County Durham Brewing;Black w/ large, creamy (nitro) beige head. Very nice lace. Roasty, chocolate flavour w/ a salty, briny, oyster quality (no doubt from the oyster water). Smooth, creamy, typically nitro feel. Flavour is roasty w/ chocolate, coffee, some woody hops, &, of course, salty oyster brine.

Trailhead Spiced Pumpkin Ale;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Trailhead Brewing Co.;On draught at the brewery as part of a sampler. The best of the 6 beers. Maybe by the end I was so desperate for something to pleasantly surprise me....but this kind of delivered. Like a pumplkin creme brulee and pie crust aspects. This was the only one of the bunch that didn�t fall apart with a weak mouthfeel. All of these beers looked great - just no mouthfeel at all.
Trailhead Spiced Pumpkin Ale;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Trailhead Brewing Co.;Draft at PMR dinner in St. Charles. I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. Really a nice pumpkin beer. Light sweetness and spice plus a good malt backbone. Pleasant.
Trailhead Spiced Pumpkin Ale;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Trailhead Brewing Co.;Sampled at Augusta. Hazy but still clearer than most. This is all about the spices.

Trailhead Spiced Pumpkin Ale;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Trailhead Brewing Co.;Tap - not much head, medium copper color, mild pumpkin and cinnamon aroma and flavor. I don�t normally like pumpkin beers because they are too strong but this one is very drinkable
Trailhead Spiced Pumpkin Ale;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Trailhead Brewing Co.;A very poor attempt at a pumpkin beer. The beer is well spiced, but lacks body and character beyond the traditional spices of the brew. The brewery needs to stop shirking on the malt and make some decent beer.

Rock Art American Red Ale;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rock Art Brewery;Mixed pack bought in Vermont. Pours a clean amber colour with a fizzy head that does not stay long. A small ring is left because of the heavy carbonation. Aroma of caramel malts with decent hops. Hints of nuts. A lot of the same for the taste, but watered down. Hoppy finish with mild bitterness. An average red ale. Sandlike residue at the bottom. Not sure if normal.
Rock Art American Red Ale;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rock Art Brewery;This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a soft hazy burnt amber color with a slight transparency about it. Soft carbonation rises at a moderate pace. There�s no head nor lacing. The smell had a strong nutty to caramel maltiness overlaying a rich toffee blend. Light cocoa backs it up decently. The flavor is basically the same with a lingering sweet nutty aftertaste leading to a dry nutty finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly smooth. A nice rolling nuttiness scampers over my tongue in a dry fashion. Overall, it�s a decent American Red ale. Everything fits for the style, it�s just nothing over the top.

Wolaver's Oatmeal Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Otter Creek Brewing;Backlog, bottle in 2010 that pours a darker brown with a medium khaki head. Notes are earthy and bready malt, cocoa dust, vanilla, coffee, cherry, and oats. Medium bodied with a rich finish. Pretty enjoyable for the style.
Wolaver's Oatmeal Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Otter Creek Brewing;From Aug 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle a clear very dark brown with amber hues and a large head of foam that dissipated slowly leaving a fine layer with good lacing. The smell is all roasty and toasty and has big notes of hot chocolate. The taste is really big. Roasted malt and a semi sweet molasses grab my taste buds right from the go and there's a hop bitterness that doesn't show up for me until near the finish but it does give the over all presentation of this oatmeal stout the proper umphh. Bottom line: This is a sample of the style that everyone should try given the chance.
Wolaver's Oatmeal Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Otter Creek Brewing;Tasted this in the Valhalla Bar on 815 & 9th Avenue, New York on the 22nd September 2015. Keg dispense, poured into a flight glass. Dull black in colour with ruby highlights and a thin off white head. Slight hint of mocha coffee present in the malty aroma. Thin oily mouthfeel and poor lacing. Dark malts deliver a roast grain flavour with milky coffee and liquorice. Dry dusty hop prickle comes through in the aftertaste. Malt in the finish with roast malt grain, mocha coffee, dark chocolate all present in the palate. A decent session Sweet Stout.
Wolaver's Oatmeal Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Otter Creek Brewing;It is silky smooth. Run of the mill smell. A little tangy for my taste. Sweet and roasty but wasn�t picking up to much chocolate outside of the smell. Thought the taste was closer to coffee. Not going to give this extra points for being organic.
Wolaver's Oatmeal Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Otter Creek Brewing;12 oz bottle. This was very good but i couldn�t say it was any better than its cousins in the non-organic realm.

Dunedin Mad Pipers Pale Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;IPA;Dunedin Brewery;Thought this was a brewpub and I guess I was right. This beer was contracted to South Carolina.

Dunedin Mad Pipers Pale Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;IPA;Dunedin Brewery;Rating # 390 Yesterday a bunch of good friends and I drove up to the Dunedin Brewery. I had hoped that they would have the Mad Pipers IPA on tap, being that it is only available at the brewery on draft, my wishes were answered!! I actually won a couple free pints playing trivia against the barkeep, which made things even better. So this was more of an East Coast IPA. Poured with a nice dark bronze body and a frothy ivory head, and draped the glass with lacing after every sip. The nose was exceptionally hoppy, but it was more of the pine and spruce chips than it was of the grapefruit. There were abundant suggestions of citrus in the flavor but it was more a zesty acidic peel likeness. Large presence of crystal malts making a nice caramel and pinesap flavor. Finished with a nice viscous and LONG DRY hoppyness, Pretty damn GOOD IPA, I just wish it was bottled so I could share it with you all!
Dunedin Mad Pipers Pale Ale;Dunedin, Florida, United States;IPA;Dunedin Brewery;"This is definitely one to try. It's basically the Pipers Pale Ale but dry hopped. In other words it has the same hop intensity and smooth palate, but on a whole new level. Great brew, and that's saying a lot coming from some one who doesn't like Pale Ales all that much (they are growing on me though; literally)."
Kubota Manju (Millions of Celebrations) Sake;Nagaoka-shi, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Daiginjo;Asahi Shuzo Brewing Company (Niigata);Bottle - Light perfumy pear and sweetness. Creamy mouthfeel. Melon and pear with a nice finish. Well done.
Kubota Manju (Millions of Celebrations) Sake;Nagaoka-shi, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Daiginjo;Asahi Shuzo Brewing Company (Niigata);[ Bottle Pour ][ 8oz ][ Okariba Kyoto ][ $9 ][ Sake Bowl + Glass ][ 11.25.15 ] >> Pours clear with slight yellowish gold tint. Nose is fresh fruit and herbs, no fusel or sickly fruity esters. Flavor piles on big with what is closer to champagne or cognac warming than sake. Excellent heavy body for sake with a dessert white wine-like, vinous flavor. Super well rounded like good cognac or Sauternes. It�s alcoholic and warming, but not hot. Beautiful in every way. Really outstanding. Incredible.

Good stuff, but I tend not to go in for this Niigata ""karakuchi"" style."

Shared in company of Craig, Stella, Jan, Charlotte, Fritz and Loz 30.10.10 I hope that I don�t get too slayed for a poor review of this Sake, I really have little experience of this type of drink. It look�s like water, great clarity, this is possibly a little rougher in the mouth than our previous Sake, but it works fine for me, smooth, not sweet, alcohol just doesn�t show, sorry cannot be anymore descriptive than that.

Kubota Senju Sake;Nagaoka-shi, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Asahi Shuzo Brewing Company (Niigata);Fruity aroma of marmelade. Spicy and alcoholic taste with a fruity finish. Fairly nice.
Kubota Senju Sake;Nagaoka-shi, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Asahi Shuzo Brewing Company (Niigata);April 2018 - Bottle at Sushi and Robata, Kensington. Short review with Teresa. As 'Kubota Senju', 15%. Pours clear, still, no head. Looks like water. Boosty, boosty water. Aroma is estery apple and pear, booze, airy. Body is smooth with lowish carbonation if any. Taste is creamy and rounded, breathy alcohol versus some botanicals and rice extract. A little rough around the edges but OK. Like most sake, this is a functional and unexciting beverage. (6-3-5-3-12=2.9)
Kubota Senju Sake;Nagaoka-shi, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Asahi Shuzo Brewing Company (Niigata);Short bottle at Takumi in Falls Church. Small fluted tasting glass. Looks like vodka.

Kubota Senju Sake;Nagaoka-shi, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Asahi Shuzo Brewing Company (Niigata);Bottle at Legacy Liquor, Vancouver Very pale color. The aroma has some anise, alcohol, not much fruit. The mouthfeel is soft, alcohol flavor, persimmon, drier in the final. Not the best one.
Kubota Senju Sake;Nagaoka-shi, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Asahi Shuzo Brewing Company (Niigata);Bottle - Lots of pear and melon and touch of booze.Almost completely clear. Sweet, rich mouthfeel and melon. Heavy and boozy. Not delicate.
Kubota Senju Sake;Nagaoka-shi, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Asahi Shuzo Brewing Company (Niigata);15.08.2015, 1,8l bottle sampled @ The Tatami Room, Barcelona: Very light straw colored. Aroma is mild rice aroma, with hints of hay, yeast and some fruits. Taste is slightly dry, yet kind of mild with a round rice flavor, hay, minerals, yeast. Nice warming mild boozy mouthfeel. Fair enough.
Kubota Senju Sake;Nagaoka-shi, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Asahi Shuzo Brewing Company (Niigata);A bit fruitier in terms of citrus than most other Sakes. Very popular and generally pretty low priced due to this. Otherwise some melon and some alcohol. Solid if not super interesting outside of the strong citrus note. Semi-recommended for fans of heffweizen.

Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Haiku Premium Select Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);It tastes like water. With a small hint of alcohol. If you're drinking it to get drunk then this seems alright.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Haiku Premium Select Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);Drinking this chilled out of the refrigerator at about 45 degrees Fahrenheit in a tulip glass. I bought this at my local Nagoya Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi Restaurant about 3 years ago, thought I'd age it to see how it tastes. The aroma has not held up it's almost like smelling wallpaper paste. The appearance has taken on a yellowish tinge which isn't appetizing in the looks department, you'd expect that in a good wine but I'm not so sure in a sake but who am I to say this is my first sake review. Taste is almost sweet, almost too sweet which isn't too bad. On the palate it kinda leaves a slight after taste of alcohol.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Draft Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Namasak�;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);Pours clear and still. Grainy and light fruit aromas. Slightly sweet fruity flavor with some alcohol. Medium body.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Draft Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Namasak�;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);"Tasted cold. Pour is very clear, colorless and leaves some tiny legs on the glass. Nose is of sweet ""something"", in beer I would call that sherry/oxidation and raw white alcohol. Some green apples. Taste is indeed a little sweet with some starchy rice flavors. Crushing alcohol. All my sake experiences so far have been boozy/hot messes, maybe I�m not a sake guy? This one is a bit less intense on the rubbing alcohol, though, and more enjoyable because of that. Still a long way from being something I would go out of my way for, though... Moderate body, a lot of drying alcohol. Maybe I just don�t get it? I�ll try to warm the remainder of this bottle now..."
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Draft Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Namasak�;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);Bottle - Touch of melon. Clear. Light, sweet and pretty tasteless. Not horrible if you have never had sake before. No complexity at all.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Draft Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Namasak�;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);355 ml bottle. Pours crystal clear. Taste is of rice, a hint of alcohol and some sour fruit. Similar aroma. Very easy to drink. Is a bit on the watery side and has a slight dryness to it. Not a bad sake for the price.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Draft Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Namasak�;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);Bottle as shown. Pours a clear color. The aroma is pepper and grain. Thin mouthfeel with a rice and mint with coconut. A good sake.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Draft Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Namasak�;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);bottle, thanks to mar, clear in color with long lasting legs, raw coconut aromas, flavors are dry, bitter, creamy melon with a wooden nickel finish
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Draft Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Namasak�;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);9/12/10. 375mL bottle. My first namasake! Clear pour. Faint, creamy rice and marshmallow aroma tainted by sourness and alcohol. Light flavor with a bit of steamed rice, but again tainted sour, almost lemon peel, and a big hint of alcohol... but at the same time, it�s watery. Bleh.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Draft Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Namasak�;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);(187ml bottle thanks to mar) clear, thick huge lasting legs, nose of honey, alcohol, vanilla, rice. Taste of fusel alcohol, subtle banana, rice, oily body, semi-dry finish.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Draft Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Namasak�;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);Clear with nice legs. Honey, alcohol, light nuts, not much else. Nice thickness, flavor is big on alcohol, light florals, and a slight honey finish.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Draft Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Namasak�;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);375mL screw top bottle. This was such a fraudulent sake. Everything about it was just so fake. The flavor was rather watered down, which is very difficult to say about sake. It was cheap booze with some rotten vegetables and out of season berries. The color was a slick clear, I could not believe clear could be so unclear. This is so the Bud or Miller of Sake. Once I get more comfortable with Sake, I feel I will rate this even lower.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Traditional Light Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);pours a very light water .. . some light melon rind and rice and water .. . alcohol burn is mild but apparent, and water .. . sake is made with water .. . quite a nice, yet simple sake .. . . . water.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Traditional Light Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);served hot. This is my first saki rating, so I cant say much more than that it was light and mostly boozy, but inoffensive.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Traditional Light Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);I�m assuming this is the on i had, the picture matches the botle. an okay sake not too bad a could sense a nutty aroma to it it was rather mild. some alcohol and rice on the flavor It was rather sweet. wouldn�t cal this dry in anyway. not a bad sake bu no to great it tasted better cold. when it got to room temp it taste almost dirty.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Traditional Light Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);Room Temperature: Sweet vodka in aroma along with some nutty hints. Dry alcohol with hints of lemon and rice. A bit other fruits too. Warmed up (approx 40 C): Sweet Vodka aroma. Dry alcohol with hints of fruit and rice in flavour. Alcohol is more present than at room temperature. On The Rocks: Vodka aroma. Very dry stinging alcohol in flavour. Boring. My first sake.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Traditional Light Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);Almond nutty nose. Thin and sweet. Little lemony on top of tongue. Dry on the sidesof mouth and down the back. Unpleasent aftertaste.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Traditional Light Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);Maybe I�m just not knowledgeable enough whre sake is concerned ... or maybe I just haven�t had the good stuff. Had Gekkeikan last night, served warm. I nursed it and it seems the first few sips were pretty good, all ricey and what-not. But by the end of the cup, it was tasting more and more like pure alcohol. I poured the last little bit out. Won�t be buying it again.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Traditional Light Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);This tastes too much like alcohol. It seems to me cheap and unworthy of my time and money. It is nice to your throat all warm going down though, especially if you�re sick or getting sick.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Traditional Light Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);Clear...mild nutty aroma (very mild)...mildly sweet with a dry mild alcohol finish...good I guess...
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Traditional Light Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);Nutty hazlenut, almond aroma, nice effervescence. Dry. Not especially viscuous. A bit of burn but the lower alcohol seems apparent. Clear water color. I know this is supposed to be cheap sake but I find these things rather enjoyable.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Traditional Light Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);Looks like water with a twinge of green to it. Nose is like cheap vodka. The taste up front is not good-it is almost all alcohol. The back end is a diffrent story-apple/pear with some sweet alcohol flavor. Interesting. This isn�t bad, but I wouldn�t drink it on a regular basis.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Traditional Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);750ml bottle, I see it is a product of the US. Folsom California to be more exact. Pours a colour of water with a bit of fizz that imitates a head of foam. It's gone in a blink of the eye. Smells interesting. Dark pitted fruits, chocolate???, licorice, earthy, boozy. The taste is a letdown. Everything in the smell is muted except the booze. Very little dark pitted fruits...licorice, no chocolate...bland as bland can get. Mouthfeel is thinner than thin. I'm having no luck with Sakes. This may be my last.
Gekkeikan (Laurel Crown) Traditional Sake;Folsom, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Gekkeikan Sake (USA);I can�t believe that I ever liked this stuff. I guess getting out and trying what the world has to offer will change one�s perspective. Big grainy rice aroma and flavor. Not much else other than alcohol. Meh.
Donnington XXX;Stow on the Wold, Gloucestershire, England;Mild Ale;Donnington Brewery;Draught. This is from old notes from when I lived in the Midlands. Got this at the pub in Stow across from the church. One of the better pints I had that day. Sad to see it is no more.
Donnington XXX;Stow on the Wold, Gloucestershire, England;Mild Ale;Donnington Brewery;Cask (handpump) at The Queens Head, Stow-on-the-Wold. Old notes from circa 1999. On a more recent visit to this pub I confirmed with the landlords and some regulars, one of whom used to work for the brewery, that this beer is definitely discontinued. They carried on making it for the one pub in the estate (I forget which) that took it but gave up a couple of years ago. So I�ll break my usual rule and rate from old notes as this historic beer is unlikely to be seen again. Dark brown with a reddish tinge. A fruity and slightly woody mild, with touches of nuttiness. Had a slightly lactic edge, similar to that found sometimes in Harveys beers. Nothing particularly out of the ordinary but a pretty decent mild that achieves what it set out to do entirely effectively. RIP.
Donnington XXX;Stow on the Wold, Gloucestershire, England;Mild Ale;Donnington Brewery;Reading Beer Fest, Gravity. My first purchase of the festival. Donnington�s beers are so rarely available outside of the brewery�s small chain of pubs around Stow on the Wold, that I had to be sure of grabbing one before they sold out. Though I didn�t want to sample the whole range - the other more regular beers I would save for a visit to Stow in the future. This dark mild has some brown fringes and a light and refreshing body. There is some soft coffee aroma and some cough syrup flavours. There�s a clean and soft acidity in the finish alongside a faint licorice. A nice, decently made, and fairly mainstream dark mild.
Donnington XXX;Stow on the Wold, Gloucestershire, England;Mild Ale;Donnington Brewery;Cask Conditioned at The Queens Head, Stow on the Wold, Gloucs. Donningtons Brewery is about as traditional as you can get. The Arkell family split in the 19th Century and Thomas Arkell bought a working watermill near Stow on the Wold to brew his beers, in the 21st century Claude carries on the family name. The brewery is idyllic, pobably the most beautiful brewery in the world, a wild claim I know. High in cotswold country, the waterwheel still drives some of the pumps and gristmills around the brewery. The brewery owns 15 pubs in a tight area around the northern cotswolds and they are all pretty much traditionally run country pubs with domino's, darts and football teams, and all just sell Donningtons beers, no selling out to marketing fads here! Claude only sells his beers through his own pubs too, although a couple of casks have made it to beer festivals if the organisers are prepared to pick them up and deliver the empties back directly to the brewery. Incidentally, this is the only way to get a look around as no visitors are allowed. The beer is a pretty standard mild and is the rarest of the pretty rare range of beers. There is a plummy fruitiness with a little spicey note. A short sweet finish. But with Donningtons its not all about the beer, its the whole package that makes it wonderful.

Momokawa Silver Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;The aroma is very neutral with mostly rice and alcohol. The appearance is clear and still. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall it�s drinkable and decent but nothing special just your run of the mill sake.
Momokawa Silver Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;quite a strong dry sake, the sake itself is self contained with its own flavors, it works well with a nice wood finish. a very tad of tartness happens at the end.

Momokawa Diamond Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;The wife picked up a bottle of this. Pours a clear almost water like clearness with some yellow. A big melon paper nose that I get in Sake. The flavor is dry, more melons, big dusty rice, funky way overripe fruit. Hmm. Very intense. Interesting.
Momokawa Diamond Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;this was an alright Sake. Not the best, but I do prefer Nijori. it�s cool that is was made here in Oregon.
Momokawa Diamond Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;From a 75 cl bottle at Tachibana Restaurant in McLean VA. Crystal clear with a delicate melon aroma and flavor. Very nice flavor and an excellent accompaniment to sushi.
Momokawa Diamond Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;Part of a sake sampler than worked well as a palate cleanser. Contains less on the fruit and more on the rice for this one.
Momokawa Ruby Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;Sample at Kyoto in SLC Clear with a green tint. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Taste is fruity, grapes, rice Decent
Momokawa Ruby Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;In Kauai, Hawaii. Excellent. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Momokawa Ruby Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;Meh...a little thin and weak for my taste. Aroma was average at best. Grape, sulfur and grainy rice. Pour was a murky light gold. Taste was melon, cucumber and sweet rice with an extremely oily mouth feel that coats the throat as it goes down. Light vegetal aftertaste. Not impressive.
Momokawa Ruby Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;My girlfriend liked this one a lot. I however did not. The sake pours to a clear body with some legs. Aroma is strong on butter and mango. The flavor has a light buttery white grape and light zin character. Some floral components. Palate is very buttery.
Momokawa Ruby Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;Placid clear yellow, almost white. Aroma is vinous and fruity with a bit of socky funk. Taste is the same with alcohol apparent, but not to a great degree, with muscat and cheese flavors delicately commingled. $15/750ml
Momokawa Ruby Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;Bottle. Pours a slightly yellow tinted clear color with ok legs. Notes of melons, blueberries, and bread yeast. A good alternative to vodka haha. Basic mouthfeel and medium length finish.
Momokawa Ruby Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;pale yellow color with very little legging. aroma is all alcohol and it�s bite... notes of rice, florals, light yeast and a grape/apple-y fruitiness. not a whole bunch going on in the flavor profile... rice, fusel and mild grape-y fruitiness come up. huge harsh burn on the finish. medium body. the front palate has an slick texture but as it passes over the tongue it quickly dries out and gets tingly from the abv% beast. leaves the chest warm for sure...
Momokawa Ruby Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;Pours still and clear with a pale, yellowish tint. Thin legging is quickly fleeting. The aroma shows sweet rice, cucumber, melon, cream, and dry koji. There�s a touch of fusel alcohol as well, indicating the impending heat. Flavors are lightly fruity, with cucumber showing mostly. Semi-dry, funky koji shows on the finish. The mouthfeel is thin but slick, with lingering alcoholic heat burning on the way down. This one is not very impressive. Lacking complexity and subtlety.
Momokawa Ruby Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;Let me start off by saying that I ain�t no sake expert.Typical sake aroma, sweet rice and fruit aroma. Taste is off sweet fruit and cheap sake. Goes down somewhat less smooth than some others I have tried. At $11.99 a bottle it is good value.
Momokawa Ruby Junmai Ginjo Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;I�ve enjoyed this one very much, its got a strong presence of rice and alcohol. it does have a thin but oily palate. I really enjoyed this one.
Rock Bottom Long Beach Black Seal Stout;Long Beach, California, United States;Stout;Rock Bottom Long Beach;On tap at the brewery. Nice aroma, roasted bitterness, coffee, chocolate, molasses. Dark black opaque with thin chocolate brown head. Watery body with nitro carbonation. Starts sweet with barley, coffee, molasses. Light carbonic tang. Bitter roasted finish with some hops. Some lactose? Smooth chocolate, nutty bitter after. Nice stout.
Rock Bottom Long Beach Black Seal Stout;Long Beach, California, United States;Stout;Rock Bottom Long Beach;A: The pour is a very dark brown color with a creamy tan head. S: A moderate roastiness with a dark chocolate aroma to it as well. Some nice earthy hop aroma to the beer too. There is just a slight nuttiness and some coffee to it as well. T: Roasted malts, coffee, and dark chocolate give this stout some decent flavor. Unfortunately there�s a definite acidity to it that is a bit off-putting. The nitro also dumbs down a lot of the flavors. M: Medium in body with a smooth, creamy carbonation. O: I wish this wasn�t on nitro so I could get a better flavor out of it, but it is what it is.
Rock Bottom Long Beach Black Seal Stout;Long Beach, California, United States;Stout;Rock Bottom Long Beach;Pours dark brown with a brown head. The aroma is roasted coffee and cocoa.

Rock Bottom Long Beach Black Seal Stout;Long Beach, California, United States;Stout;Rock Bottom Long Beach;On tap at RB Long Beach. Color was a black/dark brown. Not much head. ARoma of roasted malt, coffee and earthy. Flavor was very roasted with alot of coffee. Dry and earthy, and smoother than expected. Probably the best beer here.
Rock Bottom Long Beach Black Seal Stout;Long Beach, California, United States;Stout;Rock Bottom Long Beach;on draft at brewery, consumed on 11/12/07. Very dark brown/black. No active carbonation. Smells of roasted malt, coffee. Thin in mouth. Frontloaded flavor: initial quick bite of bitter roasted malts fades into nothing fast. No hops to balance, no lingering bitterness, no astringency. Half a stout.
Rock Bottom Long Beach Black Seal Stout;Long Beach, California, United States;Stout;Rock Bottom Long Beach;Anybody who reads my ratings knows that it�s nearly impossible for me not to love anything with chocolate malt. This is like a stout plus. Somewhere between a watery Irish and an alcoholey Russian Imperial, with chocolate maltiness reminiscent of some of my favorite porters. At the end of the sampler, nice and warm, it�s like butter to me.
Rock Bottom Long Beach Black Seal Stout;Long Beach, California, United States;Stout;Rock Bottom Long Beach;Pour was a super dark brown with a nice, creamy off-white head that was two-fingers tall and produced ample lacing. The aroma was roasted coffee and malt. Some sweet sugary notes as well. The flavor was an above average mix of smoke, roasted coffee and muted chocolate. Decent finish. The relatively thin mouthfeel made it not feel so heavy. Quite drinkable in fact.
Rock Bottom Long Beach Black Seal Stout;Long Beach, California, United States;Stout;Rock Bottom Long Beach;this is my favorite drink there, really smooth. very dark deep blackish/brown hue, w/creamy head, i love the chocolatey aroma & flavor w/hints of roated/coffee, enjoyable.
Town Hall Almighty;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Bright, beautiful, garnet hue, with a fresh, bubbling lacey, creamy head. Aroma: spicy, fruity, uplifting, angelic, airy, sweet, spectacular. Profound mouthfeel, lush, and brimming with strong, fruity delights (cherry, grapes, plums). Thoroughly hoppy, yet ably matched by malt, absolutely perfect balance, big with flavor, a most audaciously adequate barleywine, I write with a wink. At a teensy weensy 10.5 %, this did the trick in 10 oz. servings on it's first day at THB, as I sipped it over a beef stew made with their oatmeal stout. Two more later, I pen this review through the magic of growlers...and this was so popular today that it was the biggest growler-selling day in the short history of growler-selling at THB, or so I was told...let's sip another serving to be sure if I was right...Yep, it's yummy...bright, fruity, deep, fresh, and strong...Twin Citians, get your barleywine groove going at Town Hall, or regret it!
Town Hall Almighty;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Lurking hops beneath the very sweet brandyish candi sweet aroma. Smooth and sweet maltiness. Straightforward and uncomplex. A touch of liquorice. Moderate bitterness, good hop flavor.
Town Hall Almighty;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tap. A cloudy amber color with a thick laced tan head. Caramel, apples and noticeable alcohol in the aroma and flavor. A nice dark fruit and caramel finish.
Town Hall Almighty;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Light red. Fruit and hops aroma. This beer is overloaded with hops. Made me think of an ipa with sugar added. Bitter hops in the finish. Not bad, but call an ipa an ipa.
Town Hall Almighty;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Nice caramel clouded brown color with a finger high head of ivory, thickly fluffed and whipped, fades slowly, leaving a thin ring and lace in webby sheets. Aroma is light of caramel candies and not much else, semi sweetness with touches of plum and peach, ethanol creeps through as it warms. One of the lightest noses on a barleywine I have encountered. Its there, but just not in a outstanding gerth. Taste is mellowing smooth and easy of a sweet caramel, malty thick, lesser then most BW's, it seems short in length, some light mango and peach tones play within upfront as the hops enter in midway with a deep earthy pine bitterness thats calm and pleasantly soft. Feels a bit thin with a nice creamyness and alcoholic warmth seeping in. Its big, but not as big or thick as I like as this is one of my favorite styles of beer. Its no Batch 6000 or Bigfoot, but a nice sipper to sit at length with while with a friend as you BS about all the other wonderful beers you've enjoyed while at Town Hall.
Town Hall Almighty;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;holy freakin' savory yum yum. sweet, caramelly... lighter in color than any barley wine i've tried, though i've only had my first few in the past month or so. well balanced with a slightly dry hoppy finish. i really enjoyed this beer. i think an angel descended upon town hall during the creation of it. a smile 'n sip kind of beverage.
Town Hall Almighty;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Nose is light caramel and hint of butterscotch. Served pushed, I feel the colder temp is hindering what could be an exquisite bouquet. Initial bitterness snaps you to attention, then the liquid literally melts across the tongue. Hey, that wave of bitter was actually composed of little pieces of malty nougat! Heat follows up the nasal passages...mmm..tingling alcohol and carbonation on the palate, then a smile for the warming effect. Damn, this is a great beer. Cask it, and I'll 5 it. Way to go, Town Hall!

Sauer Gunzendorfer Schl�ckla;Buttenheim-Gunzendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei Sauer Gunzendorf;Slightly hazy dark golden with a small white head. Malty aroma with fresh cereal, some caramel and molasses, and a touch of smoke. Dry and slightly watery malty flavour with pronounced smoked flavour, definitely meaty German style, but perhaps also a hint of peat
Sauer Gunzendorfer Schl�ckla;Buttenheim-Gunzendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei Sauer Gunzendorf;Bottle, thanks beerandbeyond. Pours cloudy honey-coloured with a pretty thin white head. Sweet, date-honey aroma, smoked, watery flavour with a tad bit of botterness. Medium body, bitter finish, lightly smoked aftertaste.
Sauer Gunzendorfer Schl�ckla;Buttenheim-Gunzendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei Sauer Gunzendorf;It�s dark-amber with a small head. The aroma has notes of roasted malt, caramel and light smoke. The flavour is moderately sweet with notes of light smoked mead, caramel and the finish is smoked. It�s a bit too �tame� and sweet, so the end result is IMO a bit boring.
Sauer Gunzendorfer Schl�ckla;Buttenheim-Gunzendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei Sauer Gunzendorf;"Bottle from Plan B, Copenhagen Light amber color; medium sized head. Light caramel and smoke aroma. Dry mouthfeel, lean bodied; quite good caramel flavor with a touch of smoke. The final is dryish. Easy but pleasant."
Sauer Gunzendorfer Schl�ckla;Buttenheim-Gunzendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei Sauer Gunzendorf;Dezente Rauchnoten machen sich im Antrunk neben geringf�giger Herbe breit. Sehr langsam kommt auch eine trockene Getreidenote auf, die sich nur schlecht integrieren kann. S��lich, im Mittelteil auch deutlich w�rziger. Die Rauchigkeit passt ausgezeichnet, obwohl sie wie zu Beginn eher schwach ist und zumindest versucht, nicht den Mittelpunkt darzustellen. Zum Ende tut sie dies mangels anderer Aromen dann aber doch, weit dahinter Herbe und minimal der Hopfen. Danke an den Doppelbock f�r das Rauchbier, das fast etwas zu unauff�llig agiert. 7/9/10/9/8/10
Sauer Gunzendorfer Schl�ckla;Buttenheim-Gunzendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei Sauer Gunzendorf;500ml bottle, special thanks to Sebastian from Bierkompass, who gave me this beer as a gift! Strong orange-yellow beer with medium-pored foam. The smell is strong and smoky like ham. Can almost keep up with a Schlenkerla. It starts more hoppy then expected, with less smoke flavor than the smelling test suggested. The aftertaste is very mild, well hopped with a subtle touch ham. The center part is a bit harsh, but the ham flavor remains consistently dominant. Wonderful, mild smoked beer!
Sauer Gunzendorfer Schl�ckla;Buttenheim-Gunzendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei Sauer Gunzendorf;Bottle. Smoked Black Forest ham and malt aroma. Clear golden yellow color with moderate head. Sweet malt and smoked meat flavor. Nice balance. Very nice smoked beer.

From most likely a bottle at a Sake restaurant I love in NYC> Clear as water as per usual. Aroma of rice, almond, light alcohol, light fruit. A little bit of alcohol at the end with some smooth almond and fruit. Nice, but a bit boring compared to some Sakes. Commonly found though.
Sho Chiku Bai (Pine Bamboo Plum) Classic Light Sake;Berkeley, California, United States;Sak� - Junmai;Takara Sake USA;Served slightly chilled in a snifer (sorry, no guinomi)The fragrance is light, calm, fruity & floral, very fresh. Impact is medium, not too explosive but still present. Sweet flavor, subtle, but still more sweet than dry. Alcohol is fairly well hidden but detectable. Medium/strong acidity. Presence is slightly watery, not too unassuming though. Complexity: none, straight forward. Slight delicate earthiness. Tail stays around for a while to talk, but doesn't bore you or discust you. This is an easy drinking sake with pretty well rounded charactaristics. It took me a whole 750 of this stuff to get all those notes down, but I did it. I think I'm getting better at rating sakes now.

Exmoor Stag;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Exmoor Ales;One to go for if you're into toffee, caramel and what might be a quality malt, plus there is a hop in there somewhere... and yeast? Oddly, this can be a summer or winter drink. Not a six-pint quaffing ale (unless you're under 25 with fast metabolism or too old to care anymore) but a reasonable session-ending one or two pints then hit a jalfrezie.
Exmoor Stag;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Exmoor Ales;Aug 2018. 500ml brown bottle, filtered, from Tesco Weston Super Mare. A malty beer with chocolate notes. Ok, quite drinkable, but lacking in character and interest.
Exmoor Stag;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Exmoor Ales;On cask at spoons. Cloudy Chestnut brown with a medium tan cloudy head with a nice cask froth. Scent is mild.

Exmoor Stag;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Exmoor Ales;Two hand-pulled cask pints at The Old Mitre, Witheridge, Devon on 6th April 2018. Looks good, a proper amber/copper beer with a decent off-white head that stayed the distance. My sweet tooth picked up the malty molasses and their caramel and toffee flavours straight away, the aroma is also on the malty side. Good hop bitterness counteracts the malty base, most enjoyable.
Exmoor Stag;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Exmoor Ales;Bottle. Brownish coloured beer with a good head. The aroma is toffee and caramel, and the flavour is roasted with a toffee bitter body. Overall a nice bitter. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Sho Chiku Bai (Pine Bamboo Plum) Organic Nama Sake;Berkeley, California, United States;Sak� - Namasak�;Takara Sake USA;Wonderful. I found a website that rates sake! This is a clear sake, not even a yellow tinge. Light body and taste, with a hint of sugar, but still with the sake characteristics and taste that I like. Seems like the reviews here are pretty critical but I honestly don't think it's that bad. It is also great value, and was a little cheaper than everything else in the sake fridge at this wine and alcohol store in Vancouver, Canada that I stopped by.
Sho Chiku Bai (Pine Bamboo Plum) Nigori Sake;Berkeley, California, United States;Sak� - Nigori;Takara Sake USA;Very smooth and sweet. You can eat this with just about anything, I'd recommend with something spicy.

Sho Chiku Bai (Pine Bamboo Plum) Nigori Sake;Berkeley, California, United States;Sak� - Nigori;Takara Sake USA;I know nothing about sake. I'm not sure why sake is on Ratebeer. But I drank it, so I'll rate it. Made me very warm. Somewhat sweet, with gentle plum and coconut cream notes and a modest alcohol heat. Helped me survive a sushi dinner at a table with four rambunctious children. Took the edge of habanero smelt eggs. Good enough.

The body was also transparent yet had a slight yellow tint and was uncarbonated. The mild alcohol aroma contained notes of vinous rice wine. The mouth feel was of vinous alcohol at the start and at the finish. The mild flavor contained notes of vinous rice. An OK sake just nothing special.
Sho Chiku Bai (Pine Bamboo Plum) Junmai Kinpaku Sake;Berkeley, California, United States;Sak� - Junmai;Takara Sake USA;My first sake. It had a horrible milky taste to it and a foul finish. I bought this at Mitsuwa in Arlington Heights, because it was on sale for $4.99. Now I know why! To the bins!
Takara Koshu Masamune Sake;Berkeley, California, United States;Sak� - Koshu;Takara Sake USA;Not the best, but not bad in small helpings. Taste is pretty syrupy, so keeping helpings low is probably for the best.
Takara Koshu Masamune Sake;Berkeley, California, United States;Sak� - Koshu;Takara Sake USA;Guessing it�s this, it�s the Takare company, and the style is koshu. 12cl portion, from a box (Silk Sushi, Tallinn) 4 Slightly sour winey aroma. 1 Looks like grain spirit. 4 A slightly winey watered down vodka. 2 Inoffensive palate, warming like a watered down vodka. 6 Meh, it�s a crap drink that doesn�t belong on ratebeer.
Takara Koshu Masamune Sake;Berkeley, California, United States;Sak� - Koshu;Takara Sake USA;Enjoyed at a sushi bar in Utrecht. Clear water body. Sweet nose. Syrupy and sweet sake. Not too thin, well-balanced. Nicely done.
Takara Masamune Sake;Berkeley, California, United States;Sak� - Junmai;Takara Sake USA;I don�t understand - this is easily the flattest, most tasteless sake I�ve ever had. The aroma is like brining my face to a bottle of isopropyl rubbing alcohol and inhaling. The flavor is equally poor, with rare glimpses of kiwi, citrus and raspberry, but these halting and abrupt dashes of fruit flavors are extremely rare. I�ll take the OTHER standard fare, as far as low-quality sake is concerned.
Takara Masamune Sake;Berkeley, California, United States;Sak� - Junmai;Takara Sake USA;Smells and taste like a light wine. Goes down easy and it�s really not that bad.
Takara Masamune Sake;Berkeley, California, United States;Sak� - Junmai;Takara Sake USA;Its sake! It clear, no head, looks like water, tastes like riceand lots of alcohol, that somehow goes down relativily smooth. I actually love it!

Moonstone Asian Pear Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Big thank you to Erzengel for sharing and make the experience possible. Pear with some marzipan on the nose. Taste starts a little bit alcoholic without a sharpness, less but present pear, some sweetness. More light than expected, maybe a little bit thin in the second part. But nice.
Moonstone Asian Pear Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Shared with Erzengel! A colorless Sake. Aroma of sweet slightly artificial pear and Rice. Taste of sweet pears, sugar, strong fruits, slightly boozy finish.
Moonstone Asian Pear Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Many thanks to Weihenweizen for bringing this bottle to Europe. Fantastic floral pear Sake nose. Very fruity but dry. The Sake is very light and subtle in Flavour. Nothing deep, the nice pear juice is fruity fragile and fits in fantastic - but couldn�t help the light aroma with not much aftertaste. Fruity dry and highly sessionable, but no depth or long aftertaste at all.
Moonstone Asian Pear Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;300 ml cobalt blue bottle. Looks like water, smells of sweet sticky pears, alcohol. Tastes I was hoping for similar to a pear brandy, which I love, but the sweetness in the smell is muted in the taste. Loads of alcohol, some of the Sake does shin through. Would have been more to my liking if the pears ruled and the alcohol was toned down.
Moonstone Asian Pear Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Bottle - Tons of pear notes with some peel. Clear. Pear notes but the sake does pull through in the background and comes through. This is good for the style as the pear dominated but doesn�t obliterate the taste of sake.
Moonstone Asian Pear Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;300ml bottle, pours a pale colour. Very sweet synthetic pear nose. Flavour similar, but fairly hot. New to sake, but this should barely count. Alcopop.
Moonstone Asian Pear Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;"Tasting at Matt�s; 12% ABV Very pale color, almost water. Aroma of pear and green walnut, rather artificial. Soft mouthfeel, rather sweet for a Sake, the pear comes through in a very artificial way, it highlights the alcohol notes; some candied fruit, green nuts, too much glue in the end. Weird."
Moonstone Asian Pear Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;300mL bottle, pours a clear blonde. Aroma brings out notes of pears, white vinegar, and light boozy rice. Flavour brings out notes of glue, lots of phenols and artificial pears. Phenolic, fruity finish. Not terrible, but really cheap tasting and lacking any depth.
Moonstone Asian Pear Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Pours a pale colour. Sweet pear nose, with sweet rice pudding character. Taste is similar, but fairly hot. New to sake, but this should barely count. Alcopop.
Moonstone Asian Pear Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Very pale. Maybe a touch of green, but other than that, clear. The pear is artificial, candyish, just not good. The base sake is bland, and god help me the fruit character is trash.
Moonstone Raspberry Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;"Pours white wine yellow, clear with no sediment. Bright rice wine ""tropical"" nose with detectable light alcohol and very FAINT raspberry. Drinks with that unexpected yet expected light ""saltiness"" that sak�s have, 2/10-sweetness (on the dry side), mainly rice wine & soft alcohol, with hints of pineapple, raspberries (definitely not LUSH), and the alcohol and dryness takes over in the finish. Low compexity, low-med depth, okay carry, okay drinkability, not too amazing as a sipper. It takes awhile getting used to the subtlety of the raspberry flavour; the bottle is so awesome-looking and the anticipation is high...but alas, disappointed. Perhaps ok as a mixer."
Moonstone Raspberry Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Served in a small wine glass, at my local P. F. Chang�s. Turned out to be more than enough. Clear white color, with a yellow hue. Nose of rice and maybe a hint of raspberry. Little honey. Sweet taste, heat. Bigger body. Rice aftertaste, hint of raspberry. Not really the tastiest experience for me. I probably haven�t learned to appreciate this stuff yet.
Moonstone Raspberry Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;bottle thanks to mora2000. poured a light yellow with decent legs. raspberry, vanilla, light, and almonds. easy palate, alcohol, vanilla, lack of raspberries, and hot.
Moonstone Raspberry Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;(750ml bottle thanks to Mora2000) clear, tinge of pink with mild coating of the glass. Nose of subtle raspberry and rice. Taste of alcohol, rice, dry, subtle raspberry, and overall it�s a bit too alcoholic for my liking.
Moonstone Raspberry Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Bottle courtesy mora2000. Very clear appearance with almost no color. No carbonation either. Aroma is fairly faint. Not much aroma on this. Maybe a hint of raspberry but not much. Flavor is fairly sweet with rice and alcoholic wet wipes. Fake sweet flavorings. Not much raspberry.
Moonstone Raspberry Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Clear. Aroma is heavy on the rice and a little bit of raspberry. The flavor has a good bit of rice and vanilla notes with a tad bit of raspberry flavor and sweetness. Not near as much raspberry character as in a lot of other infused sakes. Decent.
Moonstone Raspberry Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Very nice and refreshing. Aroma is very sweet with only a hint of raspberry. Slightly off-white tinged body with some dripping down the side of the glass. Very smooth with just the right amount of berriness. Alcohol is not that well hidden at all.
Moonstone Raspberry Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;(Bottle) Pours a lightly pale clear pinkish tinged body. Aroma of coconut milk, raspberry, and vanilla. Flavor of vanilla, tapioca, and raspberry.
Moonstone Raspberry Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;(750ml bottle) Purchased at the Penny Farthing for $26.80. Interesting blue bottle with a coconut milk and raspberry aroma. Berry flavour turns to a alcoholic heat which finishes with a smooth whiskey like palate. Average.
Moonstone Raspberry Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;"Cold at P.F. Changs, The Woodlands, TX. Ah, dinner at one of my favorite Chinese restaraunts-- looking forward to feasting on the orange peel chicken and Dan Dan noodles-- when, before said feast, I perused the drink menu for a pre-dinner cocktail. What is this? A sake I haven�t had? Fantastic! The waiter brought the sake in a small, slender champagne glass; it looked like a flute for midgets. Anyway, the liquid staring me in the face was cake-white, sort of a cross between white and creamy beige. The aroma was sour wine and featured a subtle berry note. The first sip nearly took my breath away, and that isn�t a good thing in this case. Diluted melon and bastardized candy invaded my taste buds and almost demolished them. A watery mouthfeel didn�t help the situation, either. Guess I�m not much of an infused sake man."
Greenwich Fall Amber Lager;New York, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Sampled at the brewpub in New York 16th Dec 2005. Pale in colour with a large head some hops present, not a bad beer but nothing great.
Greenwich Fall Amber Lager;New York, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Greenwich serves a new beer about twice a year, so it's a big deal if you live nearby, as I do. Very mildly hopped and light, so don't go expecting a hopfest. Otherwise, it had a large frothy head and was a relatively uncomplicated session lager.
New York Harbor Lite;Staten Island, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yankee Brewing Company;Deep straw to light golden in color with a large white head.Mellow floral hop character as well as grain.Flavorless and highly carbonbated.
New York Harbor Lite;Staten Island, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yankee Brewing Company;Fizzy yellow color and watery mouthfeel. Aroma of some light grains, watery refreshing taste.
New York Harbor Lite;Staten Island, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yankee Brewing Company;If you like this beer's pic, thank my digital camera. Sadly, I've just read that Yankee Brewing has gone to the great brewery in the sky. But their legacy will live on in our collective memory banks. This light beer is relatively flavorful, when you consider that it's a light beer. I'd place it on par with Saranac Light, but not quite as good as Edison Light or Sam Adams Light. Besides the strong taste of water, there is a faint maltiness and some grassiness. I've read this was served at Staten Island minor league baseball games.
Rock Bottom San Diego Fright Night Porter;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom San Diego;Not what i was expecting from a porter. Flat beer with little to no development as you drink it. Expected more, but its was easy to drink.
Rock Bottom San Diego Fright Night Porter;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom San Diego;(Nitro Draft: Rock Bottom in San Diego, CA) This is a finesse beer, or at least, as finesse as a porter can be. The mildly sweet flavor accents a subtle cocoa, but it�s really pretty light for a porter. Very mild roastiness in the finish. Just a hint of alcohol is present. Almost seems like it has a bit of bourbon barrel aging to it, though this is not the case. The palate is a bit thin for a porter, though it is smooth and creamy. Lightly sweet chocolate aroma dominates the nose, but it�s generally a pretty mild nose. Dark brown in color. Pours with a slow-developing, creamy, light tan head that sticks around until the beer is gone and leaves a thick dense curtain of lace on the glass.
Rock Bottom San Diego Fright Night Porter;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom San Diego;Dark brown with basically no head. A mild aroma of chocolate, caramel and a touch of hops. A moderate body. The flavor profile matched the aroma but added some roasted malt to the mix. A decent porter, but nothing all that shocking or amazing.
Rock Bottom San Diego Fright Night Porter;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom San Diego;Has a very deep dark color, yet is not black. Bland white crusted chocolate aroma to it. Chocolate and hops seem to dominate the body. Damn near good, but I would like to see it age a while longer.
Rock Bottom San Diego Fright Night Porter;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom San Diego;big head, dark dark brown color...roasty & chocolate aroma with a touch of hoppiness...Cocoa flavors with some bitter chocolate..even a bit of licorice..tad papery/oxidized? A tad harsg but could get smoother with time, which it doesn't really have the opportunity to do..but..whateva.
Victory Schwarzwalder Pils;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Great golden appearance. Great balance of malt and bitter and aromatic classic hops. Perfect mouthfeel for a pils or a lager. And yet mine was marred by a strong salty finish, long after the bitterness or other flavors had gone. // Rerated after working my way slowly through the growler over three days. I think that what I first thought of as a kind of saltiness is probably more an element of the tettnangner hops. I also find that I am growing to like this beer as much as the Prima.
Victory Schwarzwalder Pils;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);If you like beers with strange aromas and sour taste try this Pilsner. It has character.
Victory Schwarzwalder Pils;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Poured a golden color with a white head and nice lacing on the glass. It had a citrus, Tettnanger nop aroma. Had a pilsener hop tatste, some pine. and a dry straw taste as well. Very full moutfeel! I enjoyed this more than the prima pils.
Victory Schwarzwalder Pils;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);If you like Prima Pils, you'll love this! I tried this a couple of weeks ago at the Victory Brewery and it's fabulous!!
Victory Schwarzwalder Pils;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Draft at the Grey Lodge in Philly. I'm not a Pils fan but this is a one off Pils from Victory so I gave it a try. Had a German Pils aroma I didn't care for that much. The taste was that of a Pils.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Kohnan, Inc.;My first sake. Pours like a thick vodka, smells grainy. Actually, quite a natural smell, like rice water. Taste is pretty much the same, warming, little flavor, very light. Don�t know if it�s good or bad, just tastes like what I�d expect sake to taste like.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Kohnan, Inc.;Bottle from Whole Foods, Chicago. My first dive into the sake field. so I�ll be somewhat neutral. Pours a yellowish tinge that beads on the side of the glass. Light plum of pear brandy smell. Taste is certainly delicate, with an almost watery mouthfeel. Alcohol is present, sometimes warming, sometimes like a tiny Slivovitz trying to bust my mouth open. Pear brandy notes continue down the glass. I drank this cool, as the label copy, different from this description, just suggests serving cool. If I get into more sakes, will have to revisit this later.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Kohnan, Inc.;Very clean with just a touch of yellow. The aroma is up front with some vanilla and light butter and plums, the koji is very strong and the alcohol is present. The flavor has a light impact but has some harsh alcohol tastes and a warm lingering tail. Not too bad for a Futsu-shu but it seems a bit cheaply made in the flavor like brewer's alcohol has been added. It's only 13% so it shouldn't even be this apparent. There's no complexity and only a little umami, even after sushi I'm just not feeling it here.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Kohnan, Inc.;Aroma is floral with some plums, vanilla, and citrus. A little more color to it than other Sake I've had. It has a slight yellow tint. Flavor is mild alcohol with a sugary grape and lemon aftertaste. Like slikwily said, I also don't know what good Sake should taste like but I find this particular lower end Sake to be a nice enjoyable drink.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Kohnan, Inc.;Pours like pure clean water.Fruity winelike aroma with a watery like hint at times and the alcohol coming on in hints as i roll it in the glass.Smooth taste fruity and wine like again with a nice light alcohol presence.The finish is fruity and light.since i'm unsure of what a real good Sake should taste like i'm just going to have to say that this one is very good and very drinkable.Thans to JK for sending me this bottle of brew.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Premium Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;Kohnan, Inc.;Clear color, touch of beige. The aroma is very bright with koji and coconut smells, very floral and up front. The flavor has a mildly sweet impact without too much alcohol presence. The tail is long and drug out, but is covered with koji, if that�s what you like. I like my sakes a little drier than this one. Not too bad though.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Mild Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Kohnan, Inc.;Clear color, watery legs, hadn�t turned yellow but apparently it�s been out for a while. The nose is light with some koji and alcohol burn, slightly floral with fruit but rather unpronounced. The flavor is also one dimensional with alcohol playing first fiddle and the other subtleties bowing out the back. Finishes watery & light. Fairly mild but not in a good way.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Nigori Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Nigori;Kohnan, Inc.;Bottle. Shaken into a cloudy mess. The aroma is rather like Laquer thinner. Looks like a watered down coconut milk. Taste is slightly harsh with alcohol. Slightly creamy mouthfeel from the rice sediment.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Nigori Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Nigori;Kohnan, Inc.;The U.S. sake breweries are getting competitive with their Japanese brethren, but they've got a ways to go still. I find this Hakusan Nigori to be competitive with Japan's Shirakawago Sasanigori (one of the weaker Japanese Nigori entries), with the exception of Hakusan's aroma, which is nonexistent. Hakusan Nigori suffers from blandness and too much alcohol bite, given that it's only 13%. As is to be expected, there's some sweetness in the body and a creaminess derived from all those unfiltered rice particles floating in the glass. Overall, when compared to quality Nigori, this stuff tastes a bit jet-fuelish and will perpetuate a poor stereotype about sake that is undeserved.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Plum Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Infused;Kohnan, Inc.;Pinkish peach color with a watery appearance. The aroma is of light koji and plums, artificial and VERY medicinal. The flavor is cloying sweet with a sour taste of antiseptic and light alcohol. Finishes thick and lingering with the crappyness. Too sweet and artificial tasting without enough sake nuances.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Plum Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Infused;Kohnan, Inc.;pinkish in color,mild fruity aroma with maybe a hint of alcohol,the fruit is hard to describe,maybe a bit of plum but since i�m not a fan of plums it would be hard to say for sure.The flavor comes off as very sweet and mildly fruity with a light hint of alcohol in the finish.It�s not bad but then it�s not great eather.I guess as far as the other Sake�s i�ve had this one is not to my liking,but should be tryed atleast once just due to the cheap price.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Plum Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Infused;Kohnan, Inc.;The appearance is pinkish yellow. Aroma is apples and plum. The flavor is mostly apples? I can barely detect any plums present in this one. The aftertaste is sticky and syrupy. My only complaint is that it�s too sweet.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Plum Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Infused;Kohnan, Inc.;Sweet aroma. Light pink color. Flavor is very sweet, but I didn't taste plums. Light. I'm glad I tried it...
Hakusan (White Mountain) Plum Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Infused;Kohnan, Inc.;Quite an enjoyable and inexspensive Sake. Not great but drinkable with a light meal. Nice rose colour..good plum aroma not too sickly..taste is a little on the ultra sweet side but not to bad.Nce and easy to drink however..an OK sake.
Hakusan (White Mountain) Raspberry Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Infused;Kohnan, Inc.;I can tell right now this is not going to be one of my favorites. This smells strongly of candy and fruit. I would like to try this however mixed up in a martini or something of the like. I am just not big on single dominant fruit flavors in anything that I drink. This has a strong alcohol burn as well, which when combined with the sweetness makes your eyes water and is kind of hard to drink. Cloying
Hakusan (White Mountain) Raspberry Sake;Napa, California, United States;Sak� - Infused;Kohnan, Inc.;Doesn't have the typical sour smell. Smells of raspberry candy. Taste is consistant with sake, but the raspberry takes away the bitter twang. Slightly sweet, with an alcohol burn in the end.
Ozeki (Champion) Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;"If you find a random sake listed as a ""house sake"" on almost every menu in almost every low range sushi place in NYC, it�s probably this one as it�s cheap and plentiful. Smell of almonds and a little bit of water. Flavor is similar. A little bit of sweetness and a lack there of other flavors."
Ozeki (Champion) Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;Pours light yellow. Flavors medium sweet medium alcohol, rice. Not to bad of a sake but the alcohol does somewhat overwhelm the sweet rice undertones.
Ozeki (Champion) Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;Warm w sushi. Sweet and boozy, warming on the way down. Rice/paper and traditional plum, finishes dry and sweet.
Ozeki (Champion) Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;Taste from a large bottle with friends. Floral and sweet and relatively light bodied. Moderate alcohol burn. A little bit of champagne on the back of the throat. This is only the second Sake I�ve had but this is much better than the last one.
Ozeki (Champion) Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;Sampled at a restaurant eating sushi, served hot. Pours a clear water like super pale yellow. The aroma and flavor have booze, earthy rice, grape skins and more booze. I just don�t think I will really get sake.
Ozeki (Champion) Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;of course at a chinese/japanese restaurant. Smooth and some rice falvors, very light and easy sipper. Not a bad sake. I really dont know mroe to say more, just that I enjoyed it.
Ozeki (Champion) Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;cup at yummi tori ... clear ... soft dry floral rice nose ... soft rough alcohol front ... little cocnut husk ... little aniseed ... ok

Pours a almost completely clear water, water with a few drops of lemon juice basically .. . wet rice, light alcohol, bean skin, and peach skin .. . a fairly simple sake, only a slight burn which is impressive for the 16% tag, not too shabby for a Futshu .. . . i�m gonna get that damned squirrel!!
Ozeki (Champion) Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;Moderate sake aims. Clear color. Mildly sweet beginning with a strong bitter finish.
Ozeki (Champion) Ginjo Premier Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;"375 ml bottle to snifter (served chilled). Looks good for sake; still and clear with legs from the alcohol if you swirl it. Smells and tastes of almond and plum with some perfuminess. Good on the palate, especially for the abv. Solid sake."
Ozeki (Champion) Ginjo Premier Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;I had this in a little sushi place in Anchorage with my bowl of sushi and chop sticks. I still don�e have a lot of knowledge about sake. It was served chilled, and it was still and clear. Gentle alcohol and perfume nose. Some plum notes with alcohol and flowery notes. It went well with dinner.

Ozeki (Champion) Ginjo Premier Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;This bottled sake from a bottle shop poured no head and a clear uncarbonated body. The mouth feel was weakly vinous at the start mediumly vinous at the finish with a mild burning alcohol aftertaste in the throat. The flavor contained typical notes of typical rice wine vinous alcohol. Rough and unrefined with a mild polished rice flavor. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again.
Ozeki (Champion) Ginjo Premier Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;375 ml bottle. Pours clear. Aroma is fruity with a hint of rice. Alcohol is quite present but other flavors, such as flowers and fruit make their way through. Palate is smooth. Much better than the normal Ozeki.
Ozeki (Champion) Ginjo Premier Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Ginjo;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;Chilled bottle. Clear color with a slight yellowish tinge. Aroma is fairly light, indeed fruity with maybe a touch of anise/licorice. Alcohol is noticeable in the nose but seemingly more subdued than the jet fuel sake that I have tried in the past. Light, fruity flavors with a pleasant alcohol presence. Warming, alcohol flavors are present but not dominating for 16%. Enjoyable.
Ozeki (Champion) Nigori Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Nigori;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;Bottle of 75cl, drinked in wine glasses. A really refreshing and floral sake, with a roasty aroma but sweet and floral aftertaste.

Ozeki (Champion) Dry Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Junmai;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;Fairly mild aroma of rice, fruit, and wheat-beer. Light sweet, light sour taste, fruity throughout, with a lasting sake finish. Not bad!
Ozeki (Champion) Dry Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Junmai;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;Bottle. Looks like water and smells like alcoholic water. Maybe all Sake's do, but this is my first one... Taste: Watery, some sweetish alcohol, umami, some rice perhaps and slightly sickly. Subtle fruity. Dry-ish mouthfeel. Very difficult to rate as first Sake. According to the overall rating this is no top Sake so maybe I should try some more. Rating compared to my beer ratings, so don't take this for granted...
Ozeki (Champion) Dry Sake;Hollister, California, United States;Sak� - Junmai;Ozeki Sake (USA), Inc.;Small bottle @ monthly tasting, Chez Sophie, Sep '18. Brought by me, picked up at a small Carrefour in France. My first sake rating. Pours pale, clear. Strange nose, taste is strong alcohol, almonds, soya milk, hard to describe really.

Ozeki (Champion) Osakaya Chobei Daiginjo Sake;Nishinomiya, HYOGO Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Daiginjo;Ozeki Co. (Japan);As Daiginjo One Cup. Spicy rice nose, stone fruit, ok. A bit boozy flavor, rice, fruity, stone fruit, some vanilla, spicy and peppery finish is ok. Not a great daigin by any means, but better than any I have had at this price point and I would grab one again in a pinch.

Taste is lightly sweet but more alcohol presence than the others sampled tonight. More rice and raw grain/starch, restrained alcohol as it warms, no harsh bite. Mouthfeel is more mellowed, as if it were aged,,,good density, higher body for sake that I�ve tried. Soft finish, good body.
Ozeki (Champion) Osakaya Chobei Daiginjo Sake;Nishinomiya, HYOGO Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Daiginjo;Ozeki Co. (Japan);Bottle. Pours a clear water color. Notes of melon, steamed rice, and faint pear. Nice thin mouthfeel and lingering finish.

Very boozy at the end. Enjoyable.
Ozeki (Champion) Osakaya Chobei Daiginjo Sake;Nishinomiya, HYOGO Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Daiginjo;Ozeki Co. (Japan);"Chobei has aromas of low-acidic fruits like honeydew, ripe pear, a hint of banana and faint anise. Kinda reminds me of Wrigley�s Juicyfruit, but I haven�t had any in a while so I could be wrong. Appearance is crystal clear; a swirl exposes nice legs. It tastes like it smells with a little more heat from the alcohol than I expected and it is semi-dry. I get a hint of milk chocolate (but my co-tasters disagree). The texture is nice and thick; almost oily. Moderate complexity. The finish is medium-long and dry. Overall, an excellent value Daiginjo."
Ozeki (Champion) Osakaya Chobei Daiginjo Sake;Nishinomiya, HYOGO Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Daiginjo;Ozeki Co. (Japan);Bottled, at Hotel Mulia, Senayan, Jakarta, Indonesia.

Ozeki (Champion) Osakaya Chobei Daiginjo Sake;Nishinomiya, HYOGO Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Daiginjo;Ozeki Co. (Japan);From a Cardboard box: Served in a porcelin cup. Mention of 14.5%ABV. Clear as water (as it looked from the darkened porcelin cup). Aroma is a nice rice and grainy mix with some cream and dust, liquor/alcohol and a bit of a nail polish remover touch to it, just a tiny teeny bit. The flavour was really soft. Nothing extraordinary, but a well balanced real rice tasting drink. Very soft and smooth, rice set the tone, some yeast/dust, cream, oily, slight hint of alcohol, and the slightest tone of nail polish removal (specially in the aroma and way less in the flavour). No carbo, soft creamy oily texture, medium to lightly fuller bodied and a oily texture. Very nice and smooth!

Amber with a thick, billowing, cream head, and high carbonation; light aroma of fruity malts; really soft in the mouth with some tart apple flavours but a very thin and watery body; good, fresh, kick of English hop bitterness to finish."
Warwickshire Best Bitter;Cubbington, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Warwickshire Beer Co.;Bottle. What a boring name-couldn�t they think of a more interesting one? Yellow and slightly cloudy. Hops are present with a gentle bitterness. Not as bland as its name but nothing special.
Warwickshire Best Bitter;Cubbington, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Warwickshire Beer Co.;Cask conditioned - handpump - Merchants Inn, Rugby. A headless gold coloured beer with a fruity aroma. Tired hops. The taste has a little lemon and some fruit skins suggesting tiredness. Lacking substance with just minimal bitterness. Below average.
Warwickshire Best Bitter;Cubbington, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Warwickshire Beer Co.;Bottle from Nuneaton Asda (quite a decent range of Tunnel, Purity, Warwickshire..). Did my best to pour this one properly but the sediment was completely out of control. Full-on hefeweizen haze and even a sourish woodiness on the nose. Distinctly barrelly. Fizzy, earthy-sourish homebrew flavour, with some tangy hops and a fairly astringent bitterness in the finish. Long, sweet, biscuity afters again like a wheat beer. Really strange character for a �best bitter�, but quite enjoyable apart from that crushed paracetemol off-note.

Oakwell Barnsley Bitter;Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oakwell Brewery;Nut brown. Roasty malt aroma. Remarkably dry with light-medium body. Resiny hops along with roasty malt dominates.
Oakwell Barnsley Bitter;Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oakwell Brewery;Saturday 27th Oct 2012: local CAMRA surveying trip. The first pub we hit is the only Oakwell Brewery owned place in Shropshire, The Seven Stars, in a hamlet called Cold Hatton (strange pub to have as your only outpost in a county). My first pint was of this, and I really enjoyed it. Hand-pulled into a UK sleeve, the body was a good brown, deep amber with red hints: on top an off-white head of foaming bubbles that stayed the distance and also left heavy lacing on my glass. The aroma was malty and semi-sweet, as was the taste. Mild toffee flavours are joined by fruitiness and a nutty note before the dry, bitter finish, in this well balanced brew. More to this than the Oakwell Senior.
Oakwell Barnsley Bitter;Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oakwell Brewery;Hand pulled at The Ship Inn, Leicester. Amber Bitter, with lacing. Reasonable bitter, some white pepper and nut. Slightly watery, fatty mouthfeel. Some off flavours somewhere. But not that bad. OK really.
Oakwell Barnsley Bitter;Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oakwell Brewery;On cask in Litton, Derbyshire - a deep brown Yorkshire style bitter, with a good head on it. Malty aroma, and first taste. Nothing out of the ordinary, but pleasant nonetheless.
Oakwell Barnsley Bitter;Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oakwell Brewery;Cask, Magpie, Carlisle. Reddish, malty bitter. Solid, nice tangy aftertaste, good balanced aroma with just about the right amount of carbonation. The finish becomes slightly citric and rounds off very well.

Lightly sulphurous nose with some musty hop reinforcement. Soggy Digestive, milky stillness, definite note of wood. Pleasantly hopped, mellow bitter. But completely unexceptional.
Oakwell Barnsley Bitter;Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oakwell Brewery;"A Mes rate: Gravicask at the Bricklayers. Mid brown with a good white head. Very ""green"" malty aroma with some very slight smokey notes and some nice prickly hops. Nice nutty malt in the mouth with good hoppage and a nice bitter finish.

Oakwell Barnsley Bitter;Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oakwell Brewery;Cask gravity at Bricklayers Arms 2nd Annual Yorkshire BF 08. Chestnut colour with lasting thin beige, toffeeish yeasty aroma. Sweetish malt in mouth, with some dryness on finish. Bit of butter on aroma. Finish is a vague tickle. Drinkable, but not remarkable. It�s a bitter.
Schlegel Privat;Schwelm, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Schwelm;From the bottle poured into spiegelau IPA glass. White head that quickly vanishes. Color is light yellow and clear. Nose is malty and grassy typical West german ruhr style pilsener smell. Carbonation is high and the taste is gainy and wheedy. Decent bitterness and typical grassy finish... Drinkable but no eye opener...
Schlegel Privat;Schwelm, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Schwelm;"Sorry for the german rating, but this is a lousy rating from my ""newbie"" time (2007-2009), and it�s not worth of being translated. I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! In mein Glas ergie�t sich ein sehr kr�ftig goldenes Bier mit guter feinporiger Krone. Sehr viel CO2 steigt empor.

Schlegel Privat;Schwelm, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Schwelm;"(33cl bottle) Pale golden colour with diminishing white foam. Sweet malty nose; light to medium bodied; Sweetmalty, slightly papery taste with a shy bitter hoppy finish.This one is a recreation of a former widespread beer, once brewed in Bochum and Recklinghausen until 1980. I had the opportunity to ask some older people about their memory of Schlegel and all of them told me it was awful. Brewed with cheap raw material, it was an industrial beer for industrial people during the period of heavy industries in the Ruhr area; it was rather to quench the thirst of masses of coal miners and steel workers cheap and quick than to be enjoyed. Now we have this �private� labelled recreation, which is very expensive for a 330 ml longneck bottle, available only in in-crowd pubs, representing right the opposite of the old clientele."
Schlegel Privat;Schwelm, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Schwelm;Bland, watery Export. A bit unbalanced for an Export, because the hoppiness is a bit more prevalent than it should be in a Dortmunder.
Hydes Rompers Rein;Salford, Greater Manchester, England;Stout;Hydes Brewery;1. Cask Handpump at the Penny Black, Northwich (JDW) 24/11/2003 Dark coloured fruity and rich on the palate.

Hydes Rompers Rein;Salford, Greater Manchester, England;Stout;Hydes Brewery;Cask fresh @ Gate Clock, Greenwich. A W/Spoon's pub. Stout appearance. An amazing creamy caramel, vanilla and coffee flavour - absolutely gorgeous! Creamy vanilla aroma. There's some small stout roasty bits in the finish with just a hint of soap very late on. It's the front that appeals most, though the rest of the profile is also attractive enough to make this a very yummy and moreish stout.
Starr Hill Jomo Lager;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Starr Hill Brewery;Pours a clear copper color with no head. Aroma of bread and toasted malt. Bready flavor with some toffee and toasted malt. Okay.
Starr Hill Jomo Lager;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Starr Hill Brewery;In bottle. Aroma is malty enoygh. Flavor is malty, pleasant, decent amber lager. Though perhaps not up to SABL standard.
Starr Hill Jomo Lager;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Starr Hill Brewery;Bottle at tasting event. Pours amber. Aroma and flavor are bready and toasted malts, light toffee, some lager yeast esters, and some faint spice. Light/medium body.

Starr Hill Jomo Lager;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Starr Hill Brewery;Either I got caught with an old arse bottle at WF, or this beer just sucks. Still crisp, but lacking any pronounced flavor or aroma. Generic, light sweetness and toast...a little stale. Meh.

Starr Hill Jomo Lager;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Starr Hill Brewery;Bottle at Cafe Deluxe Bethesda. Clear amber with slight head. Nose of malts, roasty, some suds. Taste malty, roasty, caramel. Smooth finish.
Starr Hill Jomo Lager;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Starr Hill Brewery;bottle @ Beer Run / Charlottesville VA --- Clear dark orange amber color, thick ivory head, streamers of lace. Bright color, good looking. Aroma of malt. Taste is semi-sweet malt that has mild carbonation on the swallow, and hops that give a sense of unsweetened tea as much as bittering. A satisfying brew, easy to drink, lots of flavor.
Starr Hill Jomo Lager;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Starr Hill Brewery;12 oz dated purchase before Dec. 2011 and served in a pint glass. Tad of sediment on bottom of bottle added mid-tasting. Pours a nice orange-amber, dark for style, but with only a little off-white head that rather quickly reduces to a ring. Not much in the way of aroma, although both light/medium malt and spicy hops are evident. The flavor too seems at first unremarkable, but there is an extra bit of bitter hops in here, as well as some �extra� malt. The body is a bit fuller than average. O - This is not a particularly bold or interesting style, and this beer stays too close to the low expectations for a macro-brewery lager excepting the extra spicy and bitter hops. The semi-dry and relatively full mouthfeel also elevate this beer. Still, I found it not flawed, perhaps, but not good or interesting enough to recommend to anyone except fans of this style.
Starr Hill Jomo Lager;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Starr Hill Brewery;Not a lot going on here guys. Pours amber without much head or lacing. Some crispness and a touch of sugar. This ones been in the back of my fridge for a while. Bottle.

Thunderhead Tiny Tim (-2013);Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Thunderhead Brewing Company;Part of a flight at the brewery. Very, very spicy on the nose. Like orange ginger and pine with honey. Flavor is pretty sweet and honey-like, with the spices backing it up. Surprisingly balanced. But it just seems so overly-spiced. Could only handle about 4 oz.
Thunderhead Tiny Tim (-2013);Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Thunderhead Brewing Company;Tap @ Thunderhead. Pours a hazy yellow appearance with a white head. Herbal, floral, wild honey, lightly grassy aroma. Pretty balanced, well integrated honey flavor with some herbal notes. Somewhat refreshing and a pretty good honey wheat for what it�s worth.
Thunderhead Tiny Tim (-2013);Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Thunderhead Brewing Company;One of my all time favorite local creations. This seasonal is more of a braggot given the large honey addition. The spice is intertwined - not overpowering. Love this one!
Thunderhead Tiny Tim (-2013);Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Thunderhead Brewing Company;On draft at brewpub. Light golden color, thin head, almost no aroma, syrupy mouthfeel. Flavor is awful, straight sugar.

Great finish. This is a very nice America Wheat and remarkably easy to drink.
Thunderhead Tiny Tim (-2013);Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Thunderhead Brewing Company;Nebraska Craft Brewers Festival: Murky golden color with a thin head. Sugary sweet honey flavors. Bit syrupy. Just OK.
Thunderhead Tiny Tim (-2013);Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Thunderhead Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. 6.5% ABV. Pale gold in color. White head with big bubbles. No aroma. Up front honey sweetness. Effervescent palate. Generous amount of honey in this ale, but still finishes with a tartness. Very drinkable and pleasant ale due to the higher alcohol and sweet flavor due to the larger honey content than you usually get in a brewpub ale. No braggot mind you, but real good nonetheless.
Thunderhead Prairie Peach Wheat;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Thunderhead Brewing Company;From a 12 oz. can. Pours a clear gold with a thin off white head. Aroma of peach. Flavors are moderately sweet fruit with just a bit of tartness. Pretty quaffable.

Thunderhead Prairie Peach Wheat;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Thunderhead Brewing Company;Clearing out some fruit beers from my inventory. Peach aroma. Flavors of peach and wheat... go figure. Creamy smooth feel but with very little carbonation. Light-bodied. Fizzy head, cloudy body, some sediment. We didn�t hit it off. It�s not you, Peach Wheat, it�s me.
Thunderhead Prairie Peach Wheat;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Thunderhead Brewing Company;"Look : Hazy dried apricot glow, 90% opaque; 2 finger head receding to a milky bubbly ring. Aroma : Fuzzy peach skins; unbuttered popcorn; some marshmallow cereal. Faint aroma. Taste : Full of peaches. Fresh, juicy, cut fuzzy peach. Put into a bowl and slurped up deliciously. If it were a little thicker it would be like milk and peaches blended into a drink. Mmm. Not much for the beer side of it though. A little malt, some buzz like peach schnapps, but mostly fresh peach. It lacks something but I haven�t decided what that is yet. Feel : Creamy, moderate carbonation, semi-dry raspy finish. Overall : This was a nice little peach ale. I imagine it would go great on a hot day. I like it better than Boulevard�s Kinda Blue for a Nebraska-area summer session fruit beer."
Thunderhead Prairie Peach Wheat;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Thunderhead Brewing Company;Can courtesy of HuskerTan, thanks! Hazy straw yellow color, white head. Aroma of dusty peach. Taste is bitter peach. Not bad.
Thunderhead Prairie Peach Wheat;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Thunderhead Brewing Company;"A cool apricot brew with a fluffy white head. Candy peaches coat a wheat foundation in both aroma and flavor. A fairly lightweight body, mild carbonation; a nice level for the beer, but the flavor and taste are just over the top sweet for me. Wouldn�t buy this again. I enjoy a nice fruit beer, but this is like candy."
Thunderhead Russian Imperial Stout;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Imperial;Thunderhead Brewing Company;Pours dark brown with a light tan head. Thick licorice and dark fruit aroma. Chocolate and very potent booze finish. Tried with Ryan and Andy at the Omaha tap room in 2017.

T- Roasty, dry, smoke, subtle cocoa, char. P- Full body, average texture, average carbonation, roasty finish. O- I somewhat expected good things and not that it was bad, but it was lacking. Plenty of smoke and roasty tones and even some meaty bacon to it but not a lot cocoa or coffee wise. Quite one dimensional.
Thunderhead Russian Imperial Stout;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Imperial;Thunderhead Brewing Company;"Thanks to bditty187 for this bottle. #106 of 300. Pours a used motor oil black, with a very creamy quarter inch dark brown head that fades very slowly to a thin swirling cap and thick ring, leaving behind a thick sheeting of lace. Smell; lots of dark roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. There�s some hints of dark fruits, with raisins and plums. Some bitter hops are present, but not very strong. Taste; the roasted malts and coffee flavors come out kicking, and then rolls smoothly into a nice, slightly sweet chocolate. Raisins and plums fade in to a good, mildly bitter, hop presence on the back of my tongue, with only a mild hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is full bodied and very smooth, with a drinkability that keeps me reaching for the glass. I was saving this bottle to celebrate the birth of my daughter who was just born on 15 June, and then found out on the same day that I�m getting a promotion. I�d say this was a great beer to celebrate both occasions. What a great beer, this is my favorite RIS to date."
Thunderhead Russian Imperial Stout;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Imperial;Thunderhead Brewing Company;On draft at the Chicken Coop brewpub in Grand Island, Nebraska.

Thunderhead Russian Imperial Stout;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Imperial;Thunderhead Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Roasted coffee aroma. Black in color with a tan head. A dry Irish-style stout. An after-bolus of delayed flavor hits the tongue. A competent stout. Finishes a little on the light side. UPDATE 1/13/06: This is now being bottled by Trevor Schaben in 750 ml bottles. I think this might get better with age.
Thunderhead Pub Pilsner;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thunderhead Brewing Company;I drank this one on tap on August 8th at the Chicken Coop in Grand Island, Nebraska. Poured a golden corn colored yellow. Nice white head with medium lacing. Crisp nose with a fruit overtone. Palate is crisp and clean with a nice touch of hops. Flavor is decent, and the finish is OK. Overall a pilsner in kind of the german tradition. Suppose considering this was Nebraska this was made with corn. Overall a well balanced brew that was enjoyable to drink.
Thunderhead Pub Pilsner;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thunderhead Brewing Company;"On tap at the Chicken Coop in Grand Island. This latest version is called ""Henry�s Hardass Pissed-off pilsner."" I can�t imagine that it is a different recipe. Whoever first entered this listing did not rate the beer originally. Pours golden yellow (dense, not pale) with a medium white head. Has a faint lager yeast aroma with a serious corn sweetness to the nose. Nice job of lacing. The corn flavor is very pronounced. Is there even corn in this? If not, why is it so grainy? Has an OK pilsner-like mouth tingle. Fruitiness is the first major out-of-place sensation. The finish is the best part- a good balance between bitter and sweet. Not great, but certainly drinkable."
Thunderhead IPA;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Thunderhead Brewing Company;"A half finger of head on a dark amber colored body. The aroma is mild grapefruit and faint overall. There�s a solid lemon bitterness in the taste. It�s straight forward and bold. The texture is crisp with moderate carbonation. It�s a ""no-frills"" IPA and build well."
Thunderhead IPA;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Thunderhead Brewing Company;"Can @ hotel room. Not sure if this should be a new entry or not, but this is titled ""Cropduster Mid-American IPA"". 6.5% abv. Pours a hazy golden appearance with a nice, off white head. Mild tropical fruit (pineapple, passionfruit, mango), a bit spicy, zesty aroma. Tangy, creamy, citrus fruity, mango, orange, pineapple, somewhat herbal bitter flavor. Pretty tasty and easy to drink."
Thunderhead IPA;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Thunderhead Brewing Company;Tap at Urbandale Chicken Coop. Slightly hazy bright bronze orange. Nose of grapefruit and dough. Some peanuts. Taste is dry grapefruit rind and hay. There is a little bit of bread crust. Ok, but more like an APA.
Thunderhead IPA;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Thunderhead Brewing Company;"Tap - ""Darens Dream IPA"" - Tap - no head at all, dark straw color, very bitter hop flavor and aroma, pretty flat not much carbonation - not the best IPA"
Thunderhead IPA;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Thunderhead Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Really not much to it--not an IPA worth drinking particularly. It was certainly drinkable, but I didn�t stick around for another beer.
Thunderhead IPA;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Thunderhead Brewing Company;Poured into a pint glass. A: Pale orange/dark yellow. Aggressive pour gave little head, but what was there laced really thick. S: Mild aroma of floral and grassy hops. Some spice and citrus. T: Pleasantly bitter, the way I like my IPAs. Spicier than the smell would suggest. Biscuit malts and grapefruit. Bold, like all beer should be, but not off putting. M: Not creamy, but smooth with a good amount of carbonation. D: Tasty and bold (great for not getting bored). Cheap also, so you won�t feel guilty about putting back a few. Cheap and delicious. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 09-28-2008 02:41:41
Thunderhead IPA;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Thunderhead Brewing Company;Bottled. Pours copper with almost no head. Smells of hops and grass. It has a taste of soap and burnt malt.

San Diego Friars I.P.A.;San Diego, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;San Diego Brewing Company;Draft: Looks pretty nice, being the fairly typical amber color you see with most IPA�s. I didn�t really get much smell from this one. Decent head with a little lacing. Initial taste is pretty good, but goes bad quickly. There is a strong residual after taste of alcohol and saccharin. Almost like someone dumped a packet of Equal in my drink. Needles to say, I didn�t care for it too much.

Good, drinkable, if unremarkable IPA.
San Diego Friars I.P.A.;San Diego, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;San Diego Brewing Company;Draft. Orange/Yellow color with a nice white head that lasted most the glass. The lacing was beautiful. Lasted the etire glass and was great to look at. I even showed my non-beer drinking friend that this was a great example of what we call lacing. He didn�t really care. Aromas were mostly grapefruity hoppiness with a touch of pine. Flavors were a little stonger, but mostly just typical IPA. The mouthfeel was a little less viscous than most IPAs that I have enjoyed, a little watered down, but overall the beer was very good.
San Diego Friars I.P.A.;San Diego, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;San Diego Brewing Company;Right from the tap at the brewing co. A mild IPA, thin white head that diminishes quickly (solvents on glass?) Nice color yellow goldish, Good carbination volume and good mouth feel. Not a crazy hopped IPA, on the moderate to low side. One weird flavor= slight yeat profile with tinge of diacytl...not indicative ove Ale yeasts at all.. Not bad, but I was suprised to notice this attribute, perhaps not aged enough or mutated yeast...who knows. All this said, I would try the beer again.

Siletz Mojo Ale;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Traded for a 22-oz bottle in the ABA �07 Annual Meeting beer bottle swap. Pours a brownish amber brew with a thick and lumpy reddish tan head that slowly dissolves and leaves behind a nice lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel malt with fruity scents of oranges, molasses, brown sugar and some spicy floral hops. Taste is a little above average in carbonation, a hint of tartness, medium bodied with flavors of roasted malt, light citrus, and some roasted nuts. Finish is slightly metalic with a roasted ripe berry and mild bitter aftertaste. Just received word that this brew had retired a few months ago.
Siletz Mojo Ale;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Pours a dark copper mahogany with a frothy light tan head. Aroma of slightly toasty caramel malts with a lot of tart vinegar and sauerkraut notes. Body is fizzy and thin with a slightly sweet caramel flavor and earthy acidic tartness. This brewery has some terrible infection issues and I hope they either correct them or stop brewing.
Siletz Mojo Ale;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Poured a hazy dark amber with a few small chunks. The head was thin and off-head. The aroma was fruity and malty with moderate notes of of pickles. The flavor was pretty tart and dry but not that bad. It smelled much worse.

Siletz Mojo Ale;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Siletz Brewing and Public House;On Tap at Siletz Roadhouse, Siletz OR. Pours out a hazy amber topped with a small head. i picked up some fruit and caramel on this one. They are no longer going to make this MOJO ALE due to a copy right law. I think it was LeftHand who started the lawsuit.
Siletz Mojo Ale;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Siletz Brewing and Public House;22 OZ bottle from Capital market. Pours a hazy dark amber/bown with a large beige slowly dissipating head that leaves a LOT of lace on the glass. Strong aroma of lemon, cherries, and yeast. Tastes just like it smells, with a strong sour/tartlemon/cherry aftertaste with some hop bitterness and a little roastiness that follows. Very tart. Well carbonated. Pretty refreshing drink. Seems more appropriate for spring than winter, but whatever..This brewery continues to make some VERY unique beers.
Siletz Mojo Ale;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Siletz Brewing and Public House;This would make a really great session strong ale. Medium bodied, with a brilliant amber coloring, and a nice beige cloudy head. Aromatics of fruit, toffee, caramel, some woody smokiness, but the body is really lacking in anything, needs more of something, way too light on the mouthfeel.
Siletz Mojo Ale;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Siletz Brewing and Public House;(Bottle, courtesy of Reid) Pours a murky reddish-brown body with a descent beige head. Aroma of spruce, white grapes, caramel, and a hint of smoke. Flavor of malt, sourness, and figs.
Siletz Mojo Ale;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Siletz Brewing and Public House;This is a hearty version of Duchesse De Bourgogne. Yes, this is American and the other is not. Still, a hint or more of sour - yet a finish of bitter. Hits at least two areas of the taste buds. And there is a lot of sediment. Could this be bottle conditioned? Or at least alive? Could be my number three choice for that desert island.
Tengumai Junmai Sake Yamahai;Matto, Ishikawa, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Shata Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottle - Creamy rice and yeast notes with some marzipan. Intense mushroom and caramel with some acidity. When heated, balances the edges nicely.
Tengumai Junmai Sake Yamahai;Matto, Ishikawa, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Shata Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottle sample at Izakaya Yama. Clo. Light earth aroma. Taste is very herbal with mushrooms. Dry finish. Tasty.
Tengumai Junmai Sake Yamahai;Matto, Ishikawa, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Shata Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Super popular sake in Japan. Had a glass at a fancy Japanese place called Kokage. Went well with the oden. Poured yellow with slightly brown tones. Slight sweer nutty aroma with a small flavor of alcohol. Similar taste though a little more sweetness and overall more flavor. Finish was smooth but the alcohol was definitely in there. Reminded me of a nutty albeit less complex koshu. Almost a bit shochu/Japanese whiskey like but with a much lighter bite. I�d buy it
Tengumai Junmai Sake Yamahai;Matto, Ishikawa, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Shata Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Doing my first sake rating with this Yamahai. I got a full 1800 ml bottle of it, so why not. Pours transparent but a bit coloured, sort of yellow�ish. Aroma has a lot of rice, some moromi and yeast. Not too fragrant but rather robust and powerful, kind of fitting with what I know about Yamahai. Taste feels full, little acidic and turns spicy at the end. Can imagine this going together with some dishes, so need to test it out, not really able to drink al of it in one go anyway. Complex sake, a lot going on, maybe not se easy to drink but definitely good to try. Feeling a bit weird when rating it with numbers (never done this for sake) but well, you have got to start from somewhere.
Tengumai Junmai Sake Yamahai;Matto, Ishikawa, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Shata Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottled@SBWF2012. Slightly hazy pale yellow colour with no head. Aroma is fruits, some rice and mild floral notes with some mild herbal notes. Flavour is fruits, rice, some mild resiny and sprucelike notes. Balanced and quite mellow sak�.
Tengumai Junmai Sake Yamahai;Matto, Ishikawa, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Shata Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Sample @ SBWF 12. Light yellow colour. Rice, fruit aroma. Fruity rice, alcohol flavour.
Tengumai Junmai Sake Yamahai;Matto, Ishikawa, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Shata Shuzo Co., Ltd.;720ml bottle (SBWF2012) Looks like a vodka. Pleasant spicy aroma, some alcohol heat. Quirky, but still clearly ricey. Thin palate. Tangy, but fairly clean. I reckon I could pair this with food quite well, but as a drink on its own, there�s not much to it and no reason for me to drink it.
Tengumai Junmai Sake Yamahai;Matto, Ishikawa, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Shata Shuzo Co., Ltd.;720 ml bottle, at home. Very yellow color. Strong rice aroma, slight caramel or mizuame, koji. Rich rice flavor, yamahai tang / funk, some candy sweetness, alcohol, fruit, even a bit of citrus. Rather co plex, with good umami, though overall not breathtaking. A bit too much roasty rice forward for my tastes
Tengumai Junmai Sake Yamahai;Matto, Ishikawa, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Shata Shuzo Co., Ltd.;At Toku restaurant, London. Light straw yellow colour. Prunes aroma. Herbal and fruity flavour, yeasty notes. Nice.
Tengumai Junmai Sake Yamahai;Matto, Ishikawa, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Shata Shuzo Co., Ltd.;What a great Yamahai. You get enough of the gamy and earthiness from the Yamahai fermentation. The flavors keep in your mouth long enough to resonate well with richer foods like good yakitori or even beef and pork dishes. Definitely not recommended for sashimi or sushi.
PTs Pub Sierra Gold;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);This is just a plain old pale lager. Not offensive in aroma, but not tasty either. Just eh mostly. Not sure if this is actually an original recipe or a name for their regular lager.
PTs Pub Sierra Gold;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Draught at Sierra Gold Pub. Clear, amber gold colour with a thin white film on top. Some lacing. Really light aroma, just a little sweet malt. Rather average flavour with only a hint of hops and maybe a little caramel. Not bad but unremarkable.
PTs Pub Sierra Gold;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);i find this beer particularly offensive. It is served only in PT�s and other bars owned by the same corporation. I asked a bartender about and he gave me a sample in a shot glass to try, and told me he didn�t expect me to finish it. i didn�t. Not even a shot glass. why they continue to brew this swill, i don�t know. i don�t konw what Braudog had prior to trying this, but it obviously affected his taste buds. Even the bartenders at PT�s and Sparky�s (the reno copy of PTs) don�t want to serve it. the only highish marks it can get are appearance. it is clear and filtered and looks like it might be ESB like. it�s not. try it on a dare. really.
PTs Pub Sierra Gold;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);"Poured with an airy head. Smooth, heavily malted and soapy a bit. Lightly fruited. Just an OK crappy-style American beer for the masses; nothing of note."
Bend Big Eddy Bitter;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bend Brewing Company;Clear amber. No head. English malty aroma. Somewhat watery. Mild toffee aroma. A little sweet. But still good in a non esb fashion.

Bend Big Eddy Bitter;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bend Brewing Company;"On draft at Belmont Station. For what it is, quite excellent, drinkable, etc. What I�d call a ""light bitter"" as opposed to a heavy one (as in I(x)PA, Barley Wines)."
Bend Big Eddy Bitter;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bend Brewing Company;Big cracker malt backbone with big hops. More of an IPA than a bitter, but it was really fantastic. Dry with some earthy and caramel components. Tried to get a growler of this but they had ran out after my sampler.
Bend Big Eddy Bitter;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bend Brewing Company;Sampled draught at Bend Brewing Company, BendCopper color, light head & lacing. Nose of light hops & esters, fairly light. Note of diacetyl and watermelon. Flavor of Columbus hops. Very earthy & up front with the hops. Finishes light, average, kinda malty.
Bend Big Eddy Bitter;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bend Brewing Company;Amber with strong lacing and a frothy head. Eh, bitter slightly with almost a bland or stale malt aroma. Some citrus. The flavor is mostly bitter. The stale malts give it an almost card board like taste. Bitter finish.
Bend Big Eddy Bitter;Bend, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bend Brewing Company;Amber in color, mostly clear. Sweet malts balanced by a very healthy, building bitterness. Creamy and smooth texture, though just a bit cloying and cobwebish in the finish. Nevertheless, a pretty decent bitter.
Bend Oktoberfest;Bend, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Bend Brewing Company;Draught @ Bend Brewing: &nbsp Fiery amber, large rocky head, nice lacing, light carbonation. &nbsp Light malty nose, slight cereal. &nbsp Similar tongue, low hop, a little mealy but not bad. &nbsp Somewhat reminds me of a Vienna. &nbsp Light on the exit, a little thin but not bad. &nbsp Soft malt base start to finish. &nbsp Clean exit. &nbsp Better than last nights offering from Deschutes. &nbsp Light but nothing that would deter me from having another.
Bend Oktoberfest;Bend, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Bend Brewing Company;Reddish brown. Aroma is toasty with notes of caramel, nuts and also quite a bit of fruit. Carbonation was a little high, I agree. An interesting Oktoberfest.
Bend Oktoberfest;Bend, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Bend Brewing Company;"Brown with red highlights; wonderfully sticky lace. A little too carbonated, but it had some really nice chewy textures. Roasty and toasty and a little nutty. Had some brown ale qualities. Rather easy to quaff, but didn't really keep my interest."
Bend Nitro Oatmeal Stout;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bend Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Black with some garnet around the edges. Beautiful beer, but the accolades stopped there. Some chocolate and roast that just didn�t follow through on the appearance.
Bend Nitro Oatmeal Stout;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bend Brewing Company;Draft @ te brewpub. Pours a black color with a small creamy off-white head. Has a roasted malty creamy aroma with hints of chocolate. Roasted malty chocolate and coffee flavor. Has a smooth roasted malty chocolate finish with some bitterness in the aftertaste.
Bend Nitro Oatmeal Stout;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bend Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub in Bend, OR--Dark black body with a slightly reddish tinge. Thick beige frothy head. Roasted, nutty, chocolate, coffee bean, oat nose. Robust, creamy, toasty, oaty flavor. Blankets tongue with silky, milky delight. Residual chocolate malt and chocolate milk notes. Yum!
Bend Nitro Oatmeal Stout;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bend Brewing Company;Just said a stout, whatever. Black body. Aroma is roasted to all hell with notes of coffee, chocolate and a hint of caramel. Bittersweet finish. Enjoyable, but not all that interesting.
Bend Nitro Oatmeal Stout;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bend Brewing Company;Cream stout - Deep dark brown, with ruby edges, small ring of bubbly brown foam. Acidic roasty chocolate nose, boring typical stout flavors. Creamy, but really weak and muddled.
Bend Nitro Oatmeal Stout;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bend Brewing Company;Very black, though I saw some burgundy poking through. Creamy, from the nitro, of course. Notes of wood, must, watered-down coffee and chocolate truffle. Hints of sourness throughout.
Aqula Helles;Akita, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Aqula;Soft white head on a golden body. Fresh grainy nose with straw, spicy german hops, and light flowers. Lively soft mouthfeel with more bready grains, floral notes and a slight hop snap. Medium dry floral finish full of white bread, a touch of rye.
Aqula Helles;Akita, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Aqula;My Bottom Line: The subtle balance of this delicate Helles is defined by citrusy, herbal hops and its hay-like cereals. A fine session lager for friendly conversations. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the hazy straw blond. -Carbonation is far from vigorous, and combined with the svelte body, makes this lager absurdly drinkable. -This extremely smooth mouthfeel still manages to withhold all the flavors this beer has to offer. -Hop bitterness could�ve been more prominent and maltiness could�ve been crunchier. Bottle, best before Aug.17th (had on June 22nd). Thx Tim!
Aqula Helles;Akita, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Aqula;Tight foamy head. Gold beer. Fresh light body and flavour. Hop finish. Delicate sweetness.
Aqula Helles;Akita, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Aqula;Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a decent sized bubbly white head. Aroma was grass, mild citrus, floral, and light malt. Flavor was similar to the aroma. Fresh with some spice thrown in. Medium body and well carbonated. Pretty solid, though nothing outstanding.
Aqula Helles;Akita, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Aqula;Hay straw golden color with a similar nose profile. Big frothy white head too. Corn also showing it presence in the nose, bujt I will skip what Marc said about that. Malty and refreshing but not overly complex. Some buscuit and flower notes at the end. Thing I did appreciate is it wasn�t as sweet as many Japanese beers.
Aqula Helles;Akita, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Aqula;A clear Golden color with a smallish White head. Grainy malt scent, no Corn or Rice here! Hay, bread dough, crisp with a slight bitter aftertaste. My first beer from this brewer, a decent start!
Aqula Q Bock;Akita, Japan;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Aqula;Tap at CBM Jimbocho in 2014. Dark, roasted malty nose with some caramel and prunes and light chocolate and smoke. Slight sticky mouthfeel, medium body. Finish is sweet with some light molasses.
Aqula Q Bock;Akita, Japan;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Aqula;"Bottle from local Yamaya store (as ""Aqula Namahage Bock""). Nose of plums dark sugar, very light chocolate, and some oxidation. Dark brown color, translucent, with a thin film of residue-like junk. Thin dark fruit flavor, with a vague sweetness, and it flattens out in finish. Thin body (for a bock), with almost zero carbonation. Dull, characterless stuff. Poorly made. I�m guessing that they bottled a bad batch and sent it out to the stores. All three bottled Aqula brews I tried recently were subpar, and I suppose I need to reevaluate when I find them on tap."
Aqula Q Bock;Akita, Japan;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Aqula;Dark chocolate, raisin. milky chocolate, dry fruit, cereals, touch of spice, clean finish. Quite free-style but pleasant, kind of rum raisin vibe to it with a cocoa edge.
Aqula Q Bock;Akita, Japan;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Aqula;Bottle. Dark brown-black. Caramelly nose with plums. Medium body. Slightly sticky, with some toffee and dark grapes. Touch of smoke. Really nice.
Aqula Q Bock;Akita, Japan;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Aqula;The Namahage bock on tap at Tadg�s Aqula event. The nicest beer from Aqula I tried at this event. It poured a nice dark reddish-black with a slight head & decent lacing. The flavor was lots of malty goodness but the body was slightly on the thin side. Overall, a really nice bock.
Aqula Q Bock;Akita, Japan;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Aqula;Bottle at home from the brewery webshop. Rich brown small golden thin head. Aroma is black treacle, bit of smoke and spice, roasty malt, some beefiness, bit of soy sauce, maybe some sweetness. Taste is similar. Quite full on, lots more black treacle taste, bit of caramel, some savoury bitterness, slightly meaty. Further down sweetness gets stronger. Lots of caramel. Sweet thick lingering finish. Nice but feels boozier than it is.
Aqula Q Bock;Akita, Japan;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Aqula;"bottled. purple with no head, looked like cola; a whiff of dessicated coconut with some dark chocolate; rum�n�raisin flavours, lightly metallic, a little fizzy but pleasantly so; finishes with vanilla sweetness. a decent effort with the quality of the ingredients showing"
Aqula Q Bock;Akita, Japan;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Aqula;"Bottle from Yamaoka. Almost black with a tinge of red. Low tan head. Rich caramel and Munich malts, with dark fruits in the nose; quite sweet. Nice dark malt flavor, with a bit of tangy fruit. Sweet, with noticeable alcohol. Bitter, rather hoppy finish. Rather light in body, with low carbonation. A true bock�nicely made with good, rich malt."
Aqula Q Bock;Akita, Japan;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Aqula;This was pretty nice...muted smell of cherry oak and chocolate, deep ruby brown with very little purplish head. Flavour was woodsy, raisiny, winey, sweet with a cotton candy twist, and slightly tart with a slight toasted puckerish finish.
Aqula Q Bock;Akita, Japan;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Aqula;Short 12OZ bottle. pours a nice hazy copper color . Belgian hop aroma. flavor is slightly tart. Great beer if it is a sour.
The Keg Night Train IPA;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;The Keg Pub and Grill;Strong stuff. This was part of The Keg�s birthday special (The Keg has changed it�s name, possibly owner.) You could get 10 pitchers for $10.
The Keg Night Train IPA;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;The Keg Pub and Grill;Draught at the Keg: Rusty orange with a billowing froth that settles, but remains in nice tan patches. Buttery pine hop aroma with some hazelnuts and chewy malts. Roasted & nutty flavours delivered by a well carbonated and slightly tangy palate. Great hop profile with caramelized dough, hints of chocolate, honey and whole hops flowers. It is most unfortunate this is the last batch�great brew.
The Keg Night Train IPA;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;The Keg Pub and Grill;Probably the Keg's best offering, although their Wheat was not available during my visit. Still, I was dissapointed that, the trademark hoppiness of a good West Coast IPA was not present, neither in the aroma nor in the taste. Slightly cloudy dark red in color with a white head and whispy lace (the only Keg brew that offered excellent lace). Bourbon cask notes on the tongue, which are somewhat odd for an IPA. Definitely the least flawed of the Keg brews I tried.
Saltspring Golden Ale;Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Gulf Islands Brewery (Salt Spring Island Ales);Not my amour its type of ale as it wasn't robust enough to excite my taste buds. Solid be but no unique characteristics.
Saltspring Golden Ale;Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Gulf Islands Brewery (Salt Spring Island Ales);Bottle from the brewery. Golden colour with an okay head. Grainy aromas with some clean malt. Tastes very fresh and crisp. Malt forward with some light fruit is what I get. I�d consider this an above average blonde. I would enjoy this again.
Saltspring Golden Ale;Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Gulf Islands Brewery (Salt Spring Island Ales);The aroma is weak, butter, malty. The flavor is the same. The finish is butter, light pine. Medium in body. Not great.
Aqula Lebensbaum;Akita, Japan;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Aqula;on tap at the aqula beer kaffee in akita. deep golden, quite dark for a pils, lasting thin white head. full aroma of pine and menthol, quite floral, plenty of grassy bitterness. i was hugely impressed with this for a while until i noticed a bit of soapiness in the aftertaste. still a very good lager by japanese standards
Aqula Kawabata Lager;Akita, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aqula;Bottle from local Speed store. Light floral hop nose, grapes, musty peach. Thin gold straw color, light filmy head. Light fruity initial, peach, some decent bittering in mid palate, and a bit sweet in the finish. Thin-medium body. Except for the bittering, this is remarkably, and disappointingly, similar to the Akita Bijin no Beer.
Aqula Kawabata Lager;Akita, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aqula;On tap at CBM Koenji. Light amber with a nice soapy off-white head. Aromas of biscuit, honey and light apricot. Taste is more of the same. Really wonderful balance between malt sweetness and hoppy bitterness. Almost perfectly balanced. A little on the boring side, but technically a very solid beer. Finish is slightly bittter with some nice sweetness that lingers. A malty lager.
Aqula Kawabata Lager;Akita, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aqula;Bottle from the brewery mail order. Light amber/golden colour with small bubbly golden head. Aroma is nice and hoppy, grassy and citrus, something floral, and a bit of biscuity malt too. Slight fruitiness in the background. Taste is not exciting, but still nice. Quite crisp, hoppiness is much more in the background allowing a nice maltiness to dominate. Some lingering sweetness and nice bitterness at the end. Slightly spritzy but very drinkable. Really surprisingly nice.
Aqula Kawabata Lager;Akita, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aqula;Draught at the brewpub. Deep gold, almost amber, with a tall, fine head. Malt-centered aroma, Urquel-like, with nice, though mild hopping. Great balance. Very nice Bohemian malt with a good hops grab. Fruity, malty, nice hop. Wow! A big surprise with rich, full-flavored malt.
Aqula Kawabata Lager;Akita, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aqula;bottled. i was quite surprised at how hazy this golden beer was. aroma of hay with some alcohol showing, moderate bitterness, perhaps a touch messy around the edges but still enjoyable drinking
Aqula Kawabata Lager;Akita, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aqula;"My Bottom Line: The feeble cereals and even weaker citrusy, noble hoppiness of this sleepy lager made me wish for another glass of their Helles. Further Personal Perceptions: -Surprisingly headless, this lager�s hazy orange dress fails to make me salivate. -The complacent carbonation and lack of crisp maltiness didn�t help the mouthfeel at all. -The finish is near vapid, sometimes watery. -Hops do have an earthy character once you�ve found their hiding place. Bottle; thx Tim!"
Aqula Kawabata Lager;Akita, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aqula;Deep golden color. Very malty nose, full body with a rich malty mouth and hints of apricots and brandy. Rich malty finish. Nice. Re-rate at the brewery- grassy hoppy nose. A bit off balance, but moderately full body. Hops really shine are done nice, but the malt should be a bit cleaner. Still nice beer, with a bit more balance would be spectacular.
Aqula Kawabata Lager;Akita, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aqula;WOW, a Japanese Lager that isn�t clear and Golden! This is an Amber, cloudy brew with an off-white creamy head. It�s bottle-conditioned with a layer of fine yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Mildly sweet hay scented, light floral/spice hops. A refreshingly tangy sweet flavor, malts with a kiss of citrus. Sweet follow, clean finish. A very tasty well made Lager (Called a Brown Lager on their Japanese language website) With this very good Lager, a nice Helles and a monster sweet Bock, this is an impressive little brewery!
The Keg Granite Peak Pilsner;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;The Keg Pub and Grill;"Sweet aroma with some hops. A stale beer smell you'd expect to encounter when touring a brewery. Clear yellow body with white, fully eroding head. No visible carbonation, but good lace. Not sweet enough. Has some off flavors. Missing something; flawed."
The Keg Wisconsin River Red Amber;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Keg Pub and Grill;Draught at the Keg: cloudy red-orange, the aroma is a black hole of sorts, I think that it was actually sucking in the air from around the table � I couldn�t get anything. Extremely light hop flavour, completely unremarkable and forgettable�
The Keg Wisconsin River Red Amber;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Keg Pub and Grill;No aroma. Murky brownish red. Very litle head and no visible carbonation. Not enjoyable. Thin, tinny and lacks sweetness.
Takashimizu Junmai Sake;Akita City, AKITA Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Akita Shurui Seizo Co., Ltd.;"Lightly chilled, served at a karaoke bar in downtown yokote, Akita prefecture. Clear from a strangely overfilled bottle. Aroma of sticky rice pudding with mango; soft, light sweetness; pleasant and warming"
Takashimizu Junmai Sake;Akita City, AKITA Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Akita Shurui Seizo Co., Ltd.;"Clear water-like appearance (the name does have the word ""mizu"" in it...). Sweet, flowery, fruity, and rice-dominant aroma. Flavors of sweet rice, fruits (citrus, pineapple, apple), some floral elements, and yeast. Mouthfeel was smooth and sticky--the tongue is at first coated in a dry sweetness--but quickly gives way to a silky and velvety texture. Alcohol is well-hidden in the flavors, but makes an appearance at the finish, which is quite dry and sweet. Great stuff."
Suigei (Drunken Whale) Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;KOCHI Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Suigei Shuzo Co.;Bottle. Pours translucent pale faint yellow and still, forms nice legs. Light tropical stone fruit esters, soft vanilla, light sweet rice, spicy alcohol, and a dry finish. Still.
Suigei (Drunken Whale) Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;KOCHI Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Suigei Shuzo Co.;"300ml bottle purchased in Kyoto. Very clean flavor, little taste of alcohol, dry. A little unexciting for my palate, but it's an impressively pure tasting sake. Might be great as a ""first sake"" for skeptics."
Suigei (Drunken Whale) Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;KOCHI Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Suigei Shuzo Co.;Pours clear, maybe jet a slight yellowish hue to it. Nose is lightly fruity, some rice yeast and a bit of anise also maybe hidden somewhere. Light and refreshing. Tastes similarly, sweet rice and some spices, then actually booze is quite there and brings along a little bitterness. Finishes with a dry and relatively bitter, even herbal linger on the tongue. Overall, not bad although finish feels slightly harsh and unbalanced to me.
Suigei (Drunken Whale) Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;KOCHI Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Suigei Shuzo Co.;Bottle - Light yeast and booze. Sweet and light bread. Touch of acidity. OK.
Suigei (Drunken Whale) Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;KOCHI Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Tokubetsu;Suigei Shuzo Co.;Bottle sample at Yama. Clear, still. Subtle anise aroma. Taste has light spice, quick finish. Nice.

Bug Ocean Wheat Beer;Perth, Western Australia, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ocean Beach Brewing Company;NFOB 2004. Expected a lot from this beer, Sadly let down. Appears watered down & tastes that way. Thin palate and mouthfeel. Faint hint of weizen aromas. Poor effort.

Spilker Wind Chill;Cortland, Nebraska, United States;Flavored - Other;Spilker Ales;On tap at the Crescent Moon Alehouse. Reddish orange in color with a nearly non-existent head. Aroma is of everything in your spice cabinet. Smells like a pumpkin pie. Very very light in body. In fact, it is just too watery to balance all the spice. Because Sam has held back on the malt, the beer is pretty light in alcohol. Just not a pleasant holiday ale due to the lack of substance.

Empyrean FestivAle;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Empyrean Brewing Company;Delayed entry from Tasting at Holiday Beerfest in Omaha: Medium amber color...not much head. Aroma is fairly lackluster...slightly citrusy/honey like with some malt accents. Flavor is odd...honey accents are about the only thing I can decipher outside of the malt, and the overall flavor is very mild. Nice on the palate. Brewer lists this as a braggot for 2007, and its definitely not brewed in the typical IPA model as the listing here suggests. Odd beer.
Empyrean FestivAle;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Empyrean Brewing Company;On draught in the haymarket. Poured bronze with a off white head. Aroma is dry with a few citrus notes. Flavor is slight citric, though I am not sure what actual fruits since it is so very slight of a taste. Solid malt body that fades into wateriness. Cotton mouth dry.
Empyrean FestivAle;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Empyrean Brewing Company;Tap at Haymarket location. 2004 version is an IPA. Amber color, slight head. This beer drinks a lot like Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale...Malts don�t make a huge impact, and it is a bit thin, but very drinkable with a nice minty/earthy/cedary hop character that makes me wonder if Nugget was used. ALso has some citrus flavor as well. Overall, a shockingly good hoppy beer from Empyrean.
Empyrean FestivAle;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Empyrean Brewing Company;Dark amber-red with a sticky film. Nice citrusy/woodsy quaff with an earthy edge. Big holiday beer that�s very good for the cold Nebraska afternoons.
Empyrean FestivAle;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Empyrean Brewing Company;This year�s (2003) Festivale was a little disappointing with less O.G. than in the past. Seemed to be a little light on spices compared to previous versions. Ginger may be missing this year? (3.1) UPDATE: 2004 Version. Very excessively hopped this year. Warm fruit undertones. This ale kicks SN Celebration�s ass! The boys in Lincoln must have gone back to the drawing board because this little holiday elf is certainly on Santa�s good list. BTW Matt, you don�t get IBU�s like this from Nugget hops! I�d guess Columbus or Chinook. (3.7). UPDATE 11/2006: On tap at the Crescent Moon Christmas Beer tasting. I�m told that this year�s Festivale is 9.0% ABV. It pours amber orange with a huge beige head. Has a fruity aroma with lots of candy sweet bubblegum smells. Very hoppy grapefruit. It is strong. The palate is slightly harsh. This is a great beer. (4.3) UPDATE 2007: On tap at the Crescent Moon. The brewer calls this a braggot this year! It is a very muddy dark amber appearance with a medium white head. The honey aroma is very mild and subtle for the style. This is slightly smoky. This is certainly sweet and even a bit toungue coating with waxiness. This is not as strong a beer as it was last year, but the honey flavor is definitely pronounced. However, the homebrew braggots that I have tried are usually 50% honey and this is a far cry from that. My rating for this is 3.4. UPDATE 2009: Again a different recipe for this year. This batch is an Imperial Steam Beer. ABV of 7%. I definitely get an infusion of cherries in the flavor. Pretty unique.

Firm thick white head. Aroma is a yeasty, hoppy bread smell. Taste is crisp, sweet and simple. Alcohol is well hidden. Palate is sofe with a bit of a metal lingering effect but not overpowering.

Upstream Ebenezer;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Old Ale;Upstream Brewing Company;On tap at Upstream, pours a deep burgundy with a small beige head. Aroma is loaded with Christmas spices, especially nutmeg and gingerbread, with a touch of cinnamon and bready caramel. Flavour tastes like a sweet gingerbread cookie, with lots of nutmeg and cinnamon, followed by caramel and bready toffee. I usually don�t care for these highly spiced beers, but this is done very well.

Aroma was some sweet malts, lots of Christmas spices - nutmeg, some ginger, cinnamon, and clove. Clove is an iffy spice for me, sometimes I love it, sometimes I don't. It was just okay this time around for me.
Upstream Ebenezer;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Old Ale;Upstream Brewing Company;Nice cinnamon aroma. Minimal off white head . cloudy brown color. Little carbonation. Flavor is upfront cinnamon and ginger. The spices stick in your mouth but is set at a nice level. Deep malty profile lies beneath.

Warming finish.
Suehiro Ken Daiginjo Sake;Fukushima Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Daiginjo;Suehiro Sake Brewery Co., Ltd;"This listing was hell to find with absolutely no English on the bottle & the upc washed away. Something there translates to ""sword"" I�m told. Bottle from Sakaya NYC. Clear, still, slightly agitated pour. Smell is subtle. The ""gorgeous aroma"" descriptor is deceiving. Starchy water, white wine, pear, wintergreen mint, & a blip of acid. Soft pear & green melon sweetness. Slightly, slightly sour-ish. Bittersweet pear seeds. A nice nip of acid. Very ""free flowing"", if anyone can understand what I mean. Almost no starch. Quite smooth. Got better after having a few, but still too subtle for me to comprehend that the pricetag is anything more then the milling."
Eisen Junmai Sake;FUKUSHIMA Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Eisen Sake Brewing Co., Ltd.;Taster from the AEON co.�s PET bottle version. A bit hazy and watery looking. Nose is light fruit and rice, some peach and melon. Flavor is rice, a bit oxidized, peaches, melon, alcohol burn. Medium silky body, rounded. Not bad but a bit boring. As was the case with all four I tried in this format, it just seemed the company was buying up the leftovers from the brewer and trying it out in a new package.

Koi No Kawa (River of Love) Junmai Ginjo Sake;YAMAGATA Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Ginjo;Koikawa Sake Brewing Co., Ltd.;A touch pricy at $17 for a champagne flute but well worth it. Appearance: Clean and clear, the color of a very pale Sauvignon Blanc. Aroma: Very crisp with pronounced pear and apricot notes. Hints of tobacco. Taste: Comparable to Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Earthy with apricot and lime flavors. Palate: Medium bodied but airy, clean, and crisp. A wonderful sake and quite vinous in most respects.
Metolius Golden Stone Amber Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);From Oct 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle a slightly hazy medium gold with a smallish head of foam that quickly shrunk to a broken fine layer. The smell was hard to determine because of how deilicate it was...maybe just a bit of roasted malt in the nose. The taste has a small bit of roasted malt up front with just a slight hint of grain and a little bitterness in and through the finish and... that's it. Pretty disappointing. Bottom line: Not much going on with this one and not really worth trying, imho.
Metolius Golden Stone Amber Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Hazy Brownish Color, Medium Head That Does Not Last, Light To None Lacing. Light Skunk Aroma. Lightly Toasted Malt, Skunk, Stale Hops. Past Its Prime. Drinkable When It is Fresh. Nothing Memorable Here. Pass It.
Metolius Golden Stone Amber Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours a typical amber ale color with aroma of roasted malt and hops. Taste is lightly hopped and slightly sweet. A light amber ale, decent taste with nothing complex. Easy drinking.
Metolius Golden Stone Amber Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Aroma is malts, bread and sweetness, standard for an amber ale. The flavor is slightly artificial caramel malt sweetness, fruit and a smooth finish.
Metolius Golden Stone Amber Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Thanks to Randy for this. Decent easy drinking Amber ale not terribly complex and less balanced and more watery than others. Some mineral flavors though. Serving: Bottle
Metolius Golden Stone Amber Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Just a slight step down from the Blond, but then again maybe not. It�s very pleasant.
Metolius Golden Stone Amber Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);22oz bottle 8/17/10 (Corner Cottage)-46� in English Pint-Pours a slightly hazy dark golden with a small off white head. Aroma of malt, caramel, and toffee. Taste of the same with a bit of hops thrown in. This light to medium bodied brew is pretty basic.
Metolius Golden Stone Amber Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Aroma notes of bread, cereal, no hops whatsoever. (I�ll get back to that in the taste section.) Color is a nice golden, medium dark honey. A weakish head, with not much staying power, but proper carbonation seems to be present. Taste is unassuming and rather bland. Some sweetness, very, very little hops, not much complexity, grainy, and despite a somewhat (albeit light) caramel color, no notes come through at all. The finish does show a maltiness, that overstays its welcome. Not horrible, definitely drinkable on a hot day, but no more than an average amber, actually, slightly below average.
Metolius Golden Stone Amber Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);This beer is a clear amber color with a medium thin light beige head that diminishes quickly. Spotty lacing on the glass. Cereal malt aroma with touches of hops. Light and very carbonated body with flavors of bready malt, light hops and a bit of caramel. The finish is malty with a left over caramel sweetness. Average overall.
Metolius Golden Stone Amber Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Bottle/22 - Poured a reddish amber in color with a medium tight white head that stuck around. Some small lacing on the glass. Aroma was a mixture of bready yeast and medium roasted malts, though not that strong for either. Taste was a bit disappointing at first, with a slight metallic aftertaste that detracted from the entire experience. Some malty sweetness with little bitterness to balance; not strongly flavored. A bit watery. I�ll skip this one the next time."

The wife asks me to check at Binny�s. Well, this is the only time my wife will actually ask me to go to the liquor store. But I ought to buy something before I ask for boxes� aha! Cheap Baltic gasohol to the rescue! Pours dark, kind of brassy yellow under a head head that dwindles away immediately. Unattractive swirl of bits left in the bottle. Smell betrays corn, plastic band-aids, phenols. Taste� well, what should I have expected? Corny, alcoholic fusels, notes of honey. Hard to find evidence of specific hops, just some bitterness that can�t keep back the sweetness. Rather insipid mouthfeel. Other ratings imply this might be better than the example I�ve found."
Gubernija Baltiskoe Pivo Svetloe;�iauliai, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Gubernija;Bottle 500 ml Sold as Zhiguly Ale Appearance: bright sunny gold, spark white bright top (short lived).

Gubernija Baltiskoe Pivo Svetloe;�iauliai, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Gubernija;"500mL Bottle of ""Zhiguly Ale."" Aroma pours forth as a messed up honey, apple flesh, earth, yeast and caramel corn. So this is what a dirty eastern european lager smells and tastes like? Pours in tangelo skin with a white rim and murky backdrop of clouds. Flavors arise as a sharp, lightly bitter honey biscuit and cornbread. It�s actually interesting, with some appreciable sweetness, orange character, full body, breadiness and light eastern hops. I�m enjoying it. Probably, because of my attraction the Baltic States and for some new signatures in beer. I�m aware it�s heavily loaded with off-flavors that most brewers would cry about, but I come to expect them in a beer like this. Different and not so hard to drink, and that�s something I can appreciate that."
Gubernija Baltiskoe Pivo Svetloe;�iauliai, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Gubernija;I actually enjoyed this beer. It had a nice fuller body, good flavors, and a crispy dry finish. The beer was slightly under complex, but was refreshing at least. Tasted a tad of alcohol, which was actually pleasant.
Gubernija Baltiskoe Pivo Svetloe;�iauliai, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Gubernija;Zhigula Ale 1 pint bottle. 1st taste was a bit on the harsh side but after that it went down smooth. Taste is reminscent of a more mainstream beer but what that would be escapes me at the moment. Well worth the $1.98 I paid for it.
Gubernija Baltiskoe Pivo Svetloe;�iauliai, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Gubernija;This $3.00 bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of foamy white colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a hazy softly carbonated light orange brown colored body and a very good lacing. The mild aroma was citriousy doughy and malt hop like. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a mellow aftertaste. The yummy flavor contained notes of malt hops dough and orange peel.
Gubernija Baltiskoe Pivo Svetloe;�iauliai, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Gubernija;The aroma is unimpressive with band-aids and maple syrup, thats it. The appearance is light amber gold with an almost non existent head. The flavor is unpleasant and like the aroma. The palate is thin and the finish chemical. This is either old or bad or both.

Good visible carbonation. Nose is bread, grain, cereal and faint spicy hop bitterness. Taste reflects the nose. Needs more bitterness or really is a lager. High carbonation medium feel.

Matilda Bay Beez Neez;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Flavored - Other;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);It's far from what it tries to offer as a honey flavoured beer, very flat taste with a bit of bitter on the end. Hard to compare to other honey based beers.
Matilda Bay Beez Neez;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Flavored - Other;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);Pours, looks, and smells like a no nonsense standard pub lager. Taste is hardly any different. Honey almost non existent at the back of the sip.

Ole Simon Julebrygg;Drammen, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Aass Bryggeri;Bottled. A brown beer with a tan head. The aroma is sweet and very malty with notes of bread and caramel. The flavor is sweet with notes of caramel and bread, as well as lighter notes of alcohol. A bit one-dimensional.
Ole Simon Julebrygg;Drammen, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Aass Bryggeri;2006 version.Thanks to larsga for this. Looks very similar to the Berentzen beer, up to and including the batch no, but what the heck. Lovely dark red. Sweet, some cardboard, some perfume. Watery. A bit spicy in the aftertaste. If I wanted to order an own brand beer, I would have made more of it!
Ole Simon Julebrygg;Drammen, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Aass Bryggeri;Medium beige head. Pretty deep dark red body. Papery, spicy licorice aroma with notes of grain. Dry, roasty taste with chocolate and paper notes and some grain. Aftertaste is dry grain. A bit watery. It�s OK, but not very exciting. (0.33l bottle. Xmas 2006 variety.)
Ole Simon Julebrygg;Drammen, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Aass Bryggeri;330 ml bottle. Chestnut colour and clear. Medium-sized off-white head. Nutty and grainy malt aroma. Hints of dark chocolate and red berries. M�nchenermalt flavour balanced by a little darker roasted malts. Bitterness from roasted malts and grassy dry hops. Quite rounded flavours, but with a powdery dry texture. Quite nice for a lower alcohol Christmas beer. No best before date on the bottle. (Thanks larsga. Did you forget to rate your own?)
Ole Simon Julebrygg;Drammen, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Aass Bryggeri;Bottle. Slightly malty, appleish aroma. Dark chestnut colour, semi-stable head. Quite malty flavour with OK bitterness. Liquorice aftertaste, and the maltiness disappears. Bitterness turns a little rough, tannins?
General Lafayette Wunderbar Pils;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Copper Crow Beer Company;Mild, grainy malt nose with some sufury notes apparent. Clear blonde body with a low cover of white head that recedes rapidly to ring. Grainy cereal malt and the same suggestion of sulfur as is found in the nose exists in the flavour along with a moderate bitterness. Light medium body with fair carbonation. Sampled on tap at the brewpub with beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, Rastacouere and Yowie.
General Lafayette Wunderbar Pils;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Copper Crow Beer Company;Draft at the brewery. Nice solid pils. Had a good clean German bite to it...
General Lafayette Wunderbar Pils;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Copper Crow Beer Company;Pours a clear pale gold color with no head. Aroma of mild hops and citrus. Flavor of hops and citrus with a bitter finish. The palate is medium and creamy and the carbonation is low.
General Lafayette Wunderbar Pils;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Copper Crow Beer Company;The Lure: Whispering straw within the sulphur. Unassuming, but aptly made. The Festivities: Crisp straw-like malts and earthy hop bitterness coexist cheerfully. Pleasant, lightly flavorful, and moreover an interesting quencher. Transcendence: Meat and potatoes can make a pleasant meal if made with care.
General Lafayette Wunderbar Pils;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Copper Crow Beer Company;Nice lacing punctuates the glass, white sheets of foam, atop the clear pale golden body. Highly sulfury, eggy pils with more watery peaks than you�d wish for. Floral, herbal tones are remote, setting a leafy trap among which the light pils malts fall and never get back from. Light bodied, moderately high carbonation, though more biting than crisp.
General Lafayette Wunderbar Pils;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Copper Crow Beer Company;On tap at GLI. Clear yellow in color with a white head. Hoppy aroma with some malt. Malty and hoppy flavor. Crisp and nice. Good beer. Enjoyable.
General Lafayette Wunderbar Pils;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Copper Crow Beer Company;Tap at GLI. Clear yellow, very little white head. Aroma has hops, some malt, and a hint of butterscotch that shows itself as the pint is downed. Malty hoppy flavor, with a hint of butterscotch that once again appears after several gulps. Crisp and decent.
General Lafayette Wunderbar Pils;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Copper Crow Beer Company;On tap. I generally don�t like pilsners but I went ahead and let my wife choose the last beer for me today. Guess what she picked? Poured a light yellow with no head. Lightly bitter. Nothing else to note other than I left and didn�t finish it (go figure, I�d rather get back to work after lunch). Rerate. Aromas and tastes of citrus and some fruits. Increased the scores and I enjoyed it a little more than my original ratings.
General Lafayette Wunderbar Pils;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Copper Crow Beer Company;Not a very good example of the pils style, way too much hops for this style, this was more like an APA, even borderline IPA with the over-use of the hops, way too bitter & dry, beautiful clear golden color with a nice lacy white head, crisp & medium in body, but way too much hops

Staropramen Kelt Original Stout;Prague, Czech Republic;Stout - Dry;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);pours out very dark and thick, the head is light and long lasting. The nose was really nothing to write home about, very slight coffee notes and maybe a touch of caramel. The body is distinctly watery and there is a lack of the dry bitterness which I would expect from a real irish stout.
Staropramen Kelt Original Stout;Prague, Czech Republic;Stout - Dry;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);"31/10 A 0.5 l bottle Doggythedog brought from Prague, thanks for sharing this just retired beer! Well, it poured dark brown, almost black body with medium sized brown cascading head. Weak coffee aroma, dry. Quite good coffee malt profile in the flavor, but rather typical for any dry stout, watery, ironically, as every ""dry stout"" is. Shorter, coffee dry finish with maybe some notes of herbal hops here, but killed with overwhelming coffee. Not my style, but Murphy�s was better as I recall, no matter it beats typical Guinness."
Staropramen Kelt Original Stout;Prague, Czech Republic;Stout - Dry;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Found what are possibly some of the last bottles in existence in a liquor store in Prague�s center, not far from U Medvidku. Shared with heavy Black (extremely dark red really) body. Small beige thick head. Dry malty nose, grainy roasty maltiness, very light dried figs. Light yoghurty malty taste, relatively smooth. A bit understated but noticable and slightly persistant hoppy, herbal bitterness in the finish. Very drinkable and beats pretty much all Irish dry stouts. Completely atypical for a Czech beerStaropramen, you suck for retiring this. I do hope they return this now that they�re rid of InBev but fat chance of that happening.
Staropramen Kelt Original Stout;Prague, Czech Republic;Stout - Dry;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);bottle, should I say, many bottles at famous metal bar Hells Bells in Prague. Pours dark brown, thick beige head. Taste, toasted malts, mocha, light malts, chocolate palate almost like milk chocolate, caramel finish, toffee/buttery mouthfeel. An easy fantastic drink, drinks like a charm.
Staropramen Kelt Original Stout;Prague, Czech Republic;Stout - Dry;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);(tap at Hells Bells (usually) in Praha) A pitch black beer with thick (nitro-oxide) roasted foam. The aroma is quite light, just a bit roasted. It has a nicely roasted taste with some sweetness and a not too bitter aftertaste. The palate is quite fitting, its very easily drinkable in large amounts.
Staropramen Kelt Original Stout;Prague, Czech Republic;Stout - Dry;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);500. Thanks, Thewolf and After4ever! Pous opaque blackish brown with a thick and lacy tan head. Nutty chocolate aroma and taste. Dry finish.

Komedake No Sake;Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Yoshi no Gawa Sak� Co.;Bottle - Earthy with mushroom notes. Mushroom and light booze with some rice.
Komedake No Sake;Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Yoshi no Gawa Sak� Co.;As Yoshinogawa Junmai in a PET bottle from Aeon Liquors. Clear and a bit oily. Nose is rice, slightly fruity, some pineapple, orange, koji. Oily, ricy and sweet. Ok but boring. As all in this series were.
Komedake No Sake;Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Yoshi no Gawa Sak� Co.;"It pours clear with a slight greenish tint. The aroma has notes of: wet dirt, earthy-tones, shitake mushrooms, rice pudding, and an odd koji funk (albeit pleasant. The taste is medium sweet; it has notes of: shitake mushrooms, rice pudding, almonds, apple cores, and cantaloupe. The palate is medium-full bodied, slick and creamy, with a long sweet finish (with slight alcohol warming). Overall, simple, but incredibly well crafted."
Komedake No Sake;Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Yoshi no Gawa Sak� Co.;Served hot. Fruity aroma - pineapple, citrus. Taste is tropical fruit. Tasty.
Komedake No Sake;Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Yoshi no Gawa Sak� Co.;A solid, well-rounded sake, a bit rough around the edges however, and lacking in any particular refinement or elegance. Meh...
Komedake No Sake;Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Yoshi no Gawa Sak� Co.;Clear liquid, minimal legs. The aroma is fruity and licoricey. The flavor is fresh and licoricy, red berries, mushrooms, vanilla. Oily mouth feel. OK, but I would probably pass if offered to me again.
Komedake No Sake;Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Yoshi no Gawa Sak� Co.;Pours as colourless as vodka. Aroma is very light but still kind of feety. Flavour is very light and sweet it is almost like water with a slight syrupy sweetness, followed by a very feet like flavour in the end. Not bad.
Komedake No Sake;Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Yoshi no Gawa Sak� Co.;BCLS 39th & Cambie. Tasted with mixed nigiri from Zipang (Main & 21st)Aroma leads with koji, wood, alcohol, after which a subtle hay note emerges. Flavour is relatively simple with wood, subtle dried peach, koji and alcohol. Finishes dry, and quite hot for a sake. The sushi, however, brings out quite a bit of sweetness, along with some florals, completely changing the tasting experience. It seems the palate shock of wasabi and pickled ginger is more to blame than the seafood or sushi rice but that was quite interesting how this beverage turned 180 degrees with dinner.
Komedake No Sake;Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Yoshi no Gawa Sak� Co.;Sample from 250 ml bottle. Clear, lightly yellow tinted. Milky, herbal, and floral aroma. Fruity, banana, milky, herbal, and olive flavours. Full bodied, smooth, silky mouthfeel.
"Kubo Shoten Denshin ""Ine"" Junmai Sake";FUKUI Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Ippongi Kubo Shoten Sake Co., Ltd.;"180 ml green bottle bought at Wellcome Superstore in Sheung Shui Centre, Sheung Shui. Clear pale apple juice yellow colour; Quite fragrant aroma of rice wine, with strong pollen, light pear flesh, floral, strong alcohol, sugar and sweet rice soup; Medium sweet taste of rice wine, with steamed crab meat, strong tartness, light pear flesh, potent warming alcohol, sugar, liquorices and strong tannin; Close to full body. Dry and slick palate; Mouth Feel is wholesome rice wine, rich and oily. Very dry, tart and surprisingly light sweet compares to most sakes. Booze is warm to the tummy but not harsh, with very bitter liquorices and tannins for a lasting astringent finish make up the rather low estery taste. Excellent!... Dry after taste. Warm and bitter to mouth. Comments: This is a very refined Junmai, with a slight semblance of Chinese Huang Jiu. Dryish, rich body, strong tartness, low sweet (yes!), nice warm booze ended with strong bitterness. Highly recommended!"
"Kubo Shoten Denshin ""Ine"" Junmai Sake";FUKUI Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Ippongi Kubo Shoten Sake Co., Ltd.;"Bottle (180ml 15-16%ABV 65% rice remaining after polishing) marked as Kubo Shoten Denshin ""Ine"" Junmai, but a different label (same shotai though). Clear water hued body with some legs. Aroma is sweet, honey, floral, biscuit, koji, melon (honeydew), minerals, flowers with a light waxy character. Taste is a bit nutty, koji, some umami (mainly in the finish), coconut milk, florals. A bit of a mineral flavor to it. Really clean with some noticeable alcohol (but pretty refined for a Junmai). A bit on the thin side of things, kind of glycerin like. Pretty clean and well made for the style. Enjoyable!"
Mizuno Shirabe Sake;Kyoto, Japan;Sak� - Ginjo;Yamamoto-Honke;Great value at my local which upon looking online seems for once came in under market. Sight cloudy clear colored. Nose is sweet fruits. Tastes of peach, melon, grass, grapes, light minerals. Slightly odd aftertaste. Sweet and minerals finish. For price I paid in NYC not. As at all.
Mizuno Shirabe Sake;Kyoto, Japan;Sak� - Ginjo;Yamamoto-Honke;My 1st Sake Rating, had this warm at dinner today with my folks. Sweet dry aroma, and sweet nice dry taste I liked it.
Ozeki (Champion) One Cup Sake;Nishinomiya, HYOGO Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Ozeki Co. (Japan);10cl cup at Mendo, Lyon, France. Pours crystal clear. Aroma is delicate of anise. Body is fairly dense, with a medium alcoholic feeling. Taste has a nice bitterness. Finish is average.
Ozeki (Champion) One Cup Sake;Nishinomiya, HYOGO Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Ozeki Co. (Japan);"Bought at a Supermarket near Oji, Tokyo. Mild sweet rice aroma, Crystal clear. Relatively mild / unsophisticated flavor but that's to be expected for the price and ""one cup"" drink-from-the-bottle style. Slightly on the sweet side. Not much fruity on the nose or flavor; aftertaste of alcohol and mild sweetness."
Ozeki (Champion) One Cup Sake;Nishinomiya, HYOGO Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Ozeki Co. (Japan);12-01-18 // glass cup from Dae Yang in D�sseldorf. My first sake! This was okay to drink. A sweetish rice wine with some dry fruits aroma, mild citrus. Boozy.
Ozeki (Champion) One Cup Sake;Nishinomiya, HYOGO Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Ozeki Co. (Japan);Wellcome on Wuxing road Taipei. I don't know good from bad sake. I so know I prefer it cold. To me this is a very light sake. Light rice and citrus on the nose. The taste is slightly bitter in a sort of quinine way. I get rice and citrus too. Overall tho, not that bad.
Genbei San No Onikoroshi (Genbei the Devil Slayer) Sake;Kyoto, Japan;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Yamamoto-Honke;Overripe honeydew, honey, corn, fusel alcohol aroma. Pale yellow. Honey flavor is predominant, but melon is underneath. Alcohol is magnified and very distracting. Watery. Drinks like a dry mead, but way too hot for my taste.
Genbei San No Onikoroshi (Genbei the Devil Slayer) Sake;Kyoto, Japan;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Yamamoto-Honke;180mL carton. $1. Cheers to cheap sake ratings. Clear with very faint brown/yellow hue. Aroma is yeasty, a bit fruity, and a bit of alcohol in the nose as it is drunk. Easy to drink. Light sweetness. Neutral flavor would go with anything, but especially light flavored foods, especially the apple beside me. I can�t believe I just said that. A dollar well spent. Would try again if there weren�t a billion other $1 sakes to try first.
Genbei San No Onikoroshi (Genbei the Devil Slayer) Sake;Kyoto, Japan;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Yamamoto-Honke;180 ml bottle...Pours water clear with a faint gold hue. Nose is very floral w/ some alcohol and yeast present. The flavor is sweet, w/ a hint of rose petal, some citrus tartness, and some alcohol burn. The sake coated my tongue, but evaporated just as quick w/ a sweet, dry finish. Very tasty, but since it is only my second sake not much to go on...
Okagura (Big God) Sake;Takahashi-shi, OKAYAMA Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Futsu-shu;Shiragiku Shuzo (Okayama);"300mL bottle. Pours a clear color; slight viscosity and strong legs. Clean aroma showing rice and sugar water; singular expression, but no show of alcohol in the nose. There is, however, the slightest bit of grain alcohol coming through in the mouth; a bit heavy overall: rice hulls, alcohol, and a bit of vanilla; again, quite focused and singular, with the only flaw in the mouth being the clear presence of alcohol; very drinkable otherwise. Medium finish: toasted rice and bread; some residual sweetness."
Chiyomusubi (Bound Forever) Oni No Shitaburui Sake;Sakaiminato-shi, TOTTORI Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Honjozo;Chiyomusubi Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottle at home just a cheap smaller bottle to enjoy during Q4 of Celtics triumph Over wizards. Fairly clear pour. Nose is almond milk and alcohol. Tastes of rich almond milk, pears, banana peel, rice. Little gritty some alcohol warmth.
Chiyomusubi (Bound Forever) Oni No Shitaburui Sake;Sakaiminato-shi, TOTTORI Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Honjozo;Chiyomusubi Shuzo Co., Ltd.;semi-dry, chewy pear and bubble gum/marshmallow and others sugary confections come to mind. sweetness peaks across the middle, where the chewiness and body grows. sweetened pear, cream, rice, etc. throughout. clean nose is light starches, light spiced pear and cream. overall easy to enjoy, semi-dry up front and more sweet in the back, which is odd. texture is marginally rough.
Chiyomusubi (Bound Forever) Oni No Shitaburui Sake;Sakaiminato-shi, TOTTORI Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Honjozo;Chiyomusubi Shuzo Co., Ltd.;"This bottled sake from a bottle shop poured a head of medium sized clear colored bubbles that were very quickly diminishing and left behind a transparent uncarbonated clear colored body and no lacing. The mild aroma was polished rice. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a strong vinous alcohol aftertaste. The strong flavor contained notes of vinous alcohol and polished rice. An OK typical alcohol burn sake. Nothing special but the name ""Oni No Shit A Burui?"" Heh but on my label it�s all one word ""The Refined Sake"" Oninoshitaburui ."
Chiyomusubi (Bound Forever) Oni No Shitaburui Sake;Sakaiminato-shi, TOTTORI Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Honjozo;Chiyomusubi Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Slightly off water-white color. Aroma is distinctively grainy with hints of banana leaf and banana peel. The flavor is very full bodied and savory, almost a little mushroom-y, with a fairly heavy and viscous mouthfeel. Light acidity on the finish. This would be nice with some heartier Japanese fare.
Seiryo (Japanese Dragon) Ai San San Sake;EHIME Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Seiryo Shuzo Co.;Strawberry, coconut, light koji, and soil nose, fabulous complexity. Crystal clear, nearly colorless. Smooth medium body, slightly watery. Alcohol content not evident until it reaches and burns the belly. Weak flavor of honeydew initially, strawberry appears at midpalate. Has some surprising attributes.
Seiryo (Japanese Dragon) Ai San San Sake;EHIME Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Seiryo Shuzo Co.;I�m not even going to waste my time going into specifics on this sake. No, it�s not futsuu-shu. But it�s not good either. I�ve had $10 magnums of sake that are better quality than this. If you�re looking for a buzz, this may be up your alley. If you�re looking for nuance, look elsewhere.
Seiryo (Japanese Dragon) Ai San San Sake;EHIME Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Seiryo Shuzo Co.;Bottle. Almost transperant, a faint yellow tone. Licorice aroma. Yeasty licorice flavours, smooth and full body. Sake Meter Value +3, hence medium dry. Highly enjoyable.
Seiryo (Japanese Dragon) Ai San San Sake;EHIME Prefecture, Japan;Sak� - Junmai;Seiryo Shuzo Co.;This Ai San San is simply wonderful. Imported from Japan in pink 300ml bottles by the Japan Sake Exporting Board, Seiryo's quality Junmai is medium-dry and demonstrates Aichi Prefecture craftsmanship at its best. Cascading floral aromas, followed by a butterscotch, rich mouthfeel rise up to greet you. The alcohol is almost undetectable, which makes drinking this colorless drink a joy, though you can smell the alcohol a bit. Overall, very pleasant.
