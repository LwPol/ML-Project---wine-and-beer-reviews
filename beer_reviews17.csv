Paulaner Brauhaus Munich Lager (Singapore);Singapore, Singapore;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Paulaner Bräuhaus Singapore (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Fresh-tasting, hazy, a bit of fresh pear, Hallertauer & Perle hops more present in the nose than on the palate. Not too bad.

Brewerkz Bock Lager;Singapore, Singapore;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brewerkz;Golden-bronze. Nice chewy aroma with light sugars and brown bread. Soft and slightly sticky. Decent.
Brewerkz Bock Lager;Singapore, Singapore;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brewerkz;Draft @ brewpub. Dark red with a tight tan head. Fruity aroma has cherries and hibiscus with a touch of sourness. Juicy, solid body. The flavors are not bad at all. Well-developed fruit. Good bready malts. Like a good fruit bread then balanced by a nice crisp finish.
Brewerkz Bock Lager;Singapore, Singapore;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brewerkz;The crowd seems rather tough on this one. Not a double, not a Celebrator, but a pleasant enough dark lager. A little fruity, a little bitter chocolate or espresso, surprising and initially off-putting notes of licorice, but nicely structured and nicely balanced. No, the Brewerkz team doesn’t use hops the way van Gogh used paint, but restraint is not always a bad thing. Enjoyable.
Brewerkz Bock Lager;Singapore, Singapore;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brewerkz;Sour bitter start to finish. Obviously not enticing unless you have an exotic taste plus palate. Difficult to swallow/consume without circumspect. Very artificial and syrupy complexion to it.
Brewerkz Bock Lager;Singapore, Singapore;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brewerkz;Hate to sound like I am harsh on this one, but i really expected more. The aroma is slight sour chocolate and this follows the beer the whole way through. The flavour profile is sour cherry-chocolate that moves in to a brief bitter phase and finishes with lingering sour/bitter chocolate. It isn’t infected, just seems to be perhaps a bit too strong (never thought i’d say that but there you go) a bit of restraint may have balanced this in to a truly great beer.
Brewerkz Bock Lager;Singapore, Singapore;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brewerkz;A rare weak link at this Singaporean brewpub. Looked great - clear amber with extraordinary head retention. Drab aroma seemed to have some Saaz (?) sourness but little else. Seemed all too reminiscent of an industrial lager. Quite a thick mouthfeel, syrupy with residual sugars. Not at all quenching. Found it too sweet and missing a middle before an acidic finish. Like the wheat beer it didn’t seem terribly true to style - which wouldn’t bother me if I liked it. Can’t say I did. Pity about the tautological name. (Draught at brewpub)
Brewerkz Bock Lager;Singapore, Singapore;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brewerkz;Draught at the brewpub, 6.8% ABV Light amber color. Very common aroma. The flavor is not bad, smooth, some malt, good body structure, medium bitterness.
Brewerkz Bock Lager;Singapore, Singapore;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brewerkz;I really wish they would do something about the name of this but they also have the Pilsner lager too. Names aside it is always a treat to visit this fine establishment in a very non-beer part of the world. A veritable oasis. I was probably a bit silly to go to the place as I cleared Singapore custons at about 10pm and I had to be up for a flight to Jakarta at 6 the next morning. aaah the things we do. At least I wasn’t disappointed. This looks fine in the shaker pint glass with a deep brown and good head that did disappear after a little time. Malt and chocolate dominate with a slight hint of fruitiness but not as pronouned at that noted by Per (shit, I just saw he in on over 7k of ratings!!!). Low bitterness and a lack of real bock grunt overall. Good but not great.
Brewerkz Bock Lager;Singapore, Singapore;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brewerkz;Draught at the brewpub. Dark amber. Tart lingonberry aroma. Sweet and fruity with an edge of tart vinegar. The mouthfeel is clean and simplistic, and the hop rate is low. Not the best offering from this otherwise solid brewpub.
Brewerkz Steam Beer;Singapore, Singapore;California Common / Steam Beer;Brewerkz;Pint on tap at Brewerkz, Singapore. Slightly cloudy amber beer with thin white head. Some lacing. Nose is distant lemon. Light body, grainy taste. Lemon finish. Simple beer, no flaws but unexciting.

Brewerkz Steam Beer;Singapore, Singapore;California Common / Steam Beer;Brewerkz;On draft at the brewpub (Riverside Point). I do wish these guys would do the grown-up thing and settle for a range of 6 to 8 beers that they do well. This one would probably make the cut. Almost delicate, its hops are nonetheless pretty full in what would pass for an English ESB (just).

Brewerkz Steam Beer;Singapore, Singapore;California Common / Steam Beer;Brewerkz;"Light amber with slight haze. Caramelly, slightly biscuity aroma is relatively mild. Sweetish, slightly chewy malts and some top esters for nuance. Hits some of the characteristics of steam beer, which is pretty cool since most ""steam"" beers don’t. Nice work."

Leavenworth Oktoberfest Ale;Olympia, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;"Bomber from work. Bottled in August, if I’m reading the notch on the label correctly; between three and four months old. Aroma is dough, bread, toast--variations on a theme I guess. Pours amber with a light haze and a bone-white head that collapses into a collar fairly quick. Taste starts out sweet before becoming bitter--much more so than traditional examples and very dry; flavors of caramel and toast. Much better than I was expecting."

Speakeasy Double Daddy IPA;San Francisco, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Speakeasy Ales and Lagers;Dark golden pour, with decent head that leaves a dotted lacing down the sides of the glass. Good intensity in the aroma. Soft carbonation level, and a bit to sweet flavor compared to the bitterness. Ok lasting tail anyway.Toffee, lots of dried fruit, grapefruit hoppy and some pine. Seemed a bit to unbalanced this one. Not that good. [On tap at 100 pív in Bratislava, Slovakia] Brewery #2015

Speakeasy Double Daddy IPA;San Francisco, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Speakeasy Ales and Lagers;Pours dark amber with a soft one-finger white head. Strong hoppy aroma, grapefruit mostly but something spicy also. Taste is sweet but not too much, with some notes of honey at first, then a strong bitterness comes out in a very long lasting finish. More balanced than expected. Not too fizzy, medium body, alcohol very well hidden. Dangerously drinkable.

Speakeasy Double Daddy IPA;San Francisco, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Speakeasy Ales and Lagers;Hazy amber, big cream frothy head, lot of lacing. Aroma is peach, apricot, dates. Taste gets caramel malts, lots of ripe fruits, feels like a very light barley wine, apricot and peach, pine and resin. Well balanced between sweet and bitter.

Pours relatively hazy dark gold with limited white foam. Aroma is grassy, honey, raisins, bread. Body is dense, with a bit of astringency. Taste is a nice combination of sweet and bitter, the latter being somehow predominant. Finish is short enough.
Younger's Draught Tavern Bitter;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Keg. Not much aroma. Balanced but bland. As it started to warm lots of odd unexpected flavours soap and salty metallic twang along with a bit of caramel and faint hops.
Younger's Draught Tavern Bitter;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Watery beer with a slightly citic aftertaste. Cloudy for a bitter with little aroma. Terrible really.
Rathaus Dunkles;Luzern, Switzerland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rathaus Brauerei;Dark brown-copper foggy body, fawn stable head. Aroma a bit smokey, malted candies, dark syrup and dark grass. Tastes solid dark malts, peat notes, smooth sweet hops, dark bread - leading to a bready malty finish. Smooth, nice, solid on palate. Good, could brew more of it, if guests really discovered it. [swingtop,special]
Rathaus Dunkles;Luzern, Switzerland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rathaus Brauerei;From tap at the brewery. Hazy amber, healthy head. Hints of smoked malts in the nose, more potent smokiness in the mouth. Drinkable.
Rathaus Dunkles;Luzern, Switzerland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Rathaus Brauerei;"Hazy amber-light copper colour; beautiful head. Nice aroma, some nice hop and some malt. Less dry than their Helles, smoother, round feeling, good body and texture, pretty good malt, correctly hopped; some caramel. Good palate, with some caramel as well, not particularly aromatic, but well balanced. Brewed with mastery, but less peculiar in the malt (or hop) than other wonderful dunkles (Haldemann Dunkles, ...). Beers of Switzerland"
Bäre-Bräu Bears Mild;Bern, Switzerland;Mild Ale;Bäre-Bräu;"Hazy amber colour, poor head. Quite nice hop aroma, not really strong; dough and yeast. Good taste, enough malt, some fruitness and a good hop character, ending in a pretty strong palate, not so long as could expect. Very similar to an English Real Ale or Pale Ale; too much carbonated and cold, so it wastes something more. Beers of Switzerland"
Bäre-Bräu Imperial Stout;Bern, Switzerland;Stout - Imperial;Bäre-Bräu;Bottle, 23 Sept 2002, 6.0% ABV, 6-3-8-5-14 Cloudy dark amber, brown (not black). Some roasted malt aroma, not impressive, some sourness in the nose. Good body strength, mouthfilling pleasant sensation, good malt, a lot of roasted and chocolate malt character, a very good hopping, providing the necessary strength (also a quite good aroma, but hidden by the roasted malt character). Imperial Stout? not at all, more similar to a Mild, just stronger and more bitter. Keg, 12 June 2003, 4.2% ABV, 9-5-7-4-15 Black color, thick brown head. Wonderful, powerful aroma: roasted malt, unmalted grains, coffee, chemicals. Very drinkable, equilibrated, reasonable body structure, quite good roasted malt and coffee, a touch of acidity. Long palate.
Schlafly Hop Harvest Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Saint Louis Brewery;Cloudy, dark yellow almost orange pour. Thick white head that lasts. Strong hops in the nose, citrusy and floral. A little toasted sweet malt too. Surprisingly smooth on the tongue, medium body, light fizz. The malt flavor is in front, but the strong hops come quickly and give strong earth and resin flavors. The finish is sour, but less that expected. A good, challenging IPA.
Schlafly Hop Harvest Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Saint Louis Brewery;Hazy muddy brown color, with decent lacing. Very neutral aroma.. just a slight hint of earth and hops. The taste is pleasant.. light, fruity, hoppy.. just a little bitter. A nice beer.
Schlafly Hop Harvest Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Saint Louis Brewery;Это пиво вкусное. я, конечно, рекомендую его всем, что любит хорошую Craft пива!
Schlafly Hop Harvest Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Saint Louis Brewery;Tap, as hop harvest trial - a different dry hop, which does not create a new entry IMO. Pours clear amber, medium off white head, good lacing. Aroma is light spruce. Flavor is a bit odd, source, green tea, composted grass clippings, parsley, other dried herbs. Flavor follows, light sweet and light plus bitter. Medium body. Odd.
Schlafly Hop Harvest Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Saint Louis Brewery;Very nicely done. Lots of orange, almost mandarin aroma. Overlaid on a backbone of malt more evident than most pale ales these days. Medium bitter finish. Lively carbonation. Touch of sweet malt and alcohol as well. Orange with ok head and lacing. Tap at Pizzeria Paradiso Dupont.
Schlafly Hop Harvest Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap at Rock and Run Brewery. A deep hazy amber color with a thick and persistent white head of foam with great lacing. Bright aroma of citrus rind and grapefruit with some tropical character, grassy hops and chivy dankness. Taste is orange zest and grapefruit with some tropical fruit pulp and a grassy/piney bitterness. Some caramel sweetness and bready malt backbone ever so faintly add balance to the hop flavors. Finishes dry with a nice crisp bitterness. Mouthfeel is semi creamy with a medium body and carbonation. A very drinkable and expertly crafted IPA with great flavor.
Schlafly Hop Harvest Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap. A good, smooth beer. Very much like a saison in aroma and in taste. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Schlafly Hop Harvest Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Saint Louis Brewery;Tap pours a deep golden yellow with white foam. The aroma is herbal wet towel musty grains. The flavor is rich grains with an orange light lemon and tropical fruit bitter complimented by an earthy herbal in the dryness. Hearty carbonation fills it out the flavor and makes it a decent ipa with a lasting light dunes and blend of hop flavors.
Schlafly Hop Harvest Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Saint Louis Brewery;Tap - small foamy head, nice orange copper color, very good tropical/citrus fruit hop aroma and flavor, fair malt balance - very good overall ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Schlafly Hop Harvest Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Saint Louis Brewery;Tasted at the Taproom. It poured a golden color with an off-white head. The aroma was of lemon, malts and earthy herbal hops. The taste was of lemon citrus notes with a light body and some lightly sweet malts that really make it happen for me. Very nice.
Heartland Dunkelweizen;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Greenpoint Beer Works;A moderate beer. The description promise something more. Tasted at a beerpub in New York, where they had 8 beers of them at there pub. 5.25 % alcohol
Heartland Dunkelweizen;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Greenpoint Beer Works;Not the usual banana/clove character of other wheats... more like a dark version of an american wheat
Heartland Dunkelweizen;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Greenpoint Beer Works;Dark golden in color, hazy appearance, excellent head, but a bit bland, seemed a little watered down, not a whole lot of those 'usual' wheat qualities

Samuel Adams Bitter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boston Beer Company;This is by far one of the best offerings to the gods that sam adams has made..... I recomend this to anyone... I had some at Doyles as well its a very good beer at least tis not a macro
Samuel Adams Bitter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boston Beer Company;Got this at Doyle's Cafe in Jamaica Plain (section of Boston) after a trip to the Sam Adams brewery. Apparently, they're the first pub to sell Sam Adams back in 82-83, and the people at the brewery continually grace them with casks of odd brews. Luckily, I stopped by for a bite when some bitter was on tap. Casked. Sam Adams' offering can stand up to the finest english bitters. Rich, warm, full bodied, with that light apple aroma. Easily the best beer Sam Adams ever made.... in my opinion. I do love a good bitter, though. Outstanding.
Sly Fox Incubus;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Bit of a nice candy aroma. Taste is a semi strong candy, some sugar,and malts. High abc hidden well.
Sly Fox Incubus;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Sly Fox Brewing Company;750 ml corked and caged bottle. Deep honey gold color topped by a small firm creamy beige head.

A bit too sweet for the Tripel style.

Sly Fox Incubus;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Sly Fox Brewing Company;BB log, Bottle, pours a murky golden with a medium sized off-white head. Smell and flavor are sugar, sweet malt, toast, pepper, and dark fruit. Medium bodied with a boozy and sweet close. Too much sugar for me in the end. I’ll stick to the traditional triples.
Sly Fox Incubus;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Better fix the description because I got this on tap at the bocktown. Clear pale with a neutral aroma. Big strong volatile initial taste impressions. Eventually evolves to t sweet dubble or trippel feel. Taste is a little more forward than the civilized old country trippels. Not bad for a domestic wannah bee.
Sly Fox Incubus;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Draft at Snallygaster 2016. Poured a light orange golden yellow color with a white head. Aroma was light crisp malts, citrus. Floral character. Light fruity notes.

Red Rock Amber Ale (American Session Ale);Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Red Rock Brewing;On tap at the brewery pours out amber topped with a sand head. Nose is nice light grain notes some grape fruit hops and a little pine. Taste is more of the nice sweet malts grain and a hop combo.
Red Rock Amber Ale (American Session Ale);Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Red Rock Brewing;Pours an enticing copper color with a hoppy aroma. Bitter hoppy taste. I like ambers, but this one is not my style.
Red Rock Amber Ale (American Session Ale);Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Red Rock Brewing;From bottle it’s filtered amber with a thin off-white head. Hoppy aroma is tea, sap, grapefruit, lychee, with some caramel, toast and fall leaf malt touches, clean fermentation, and a complimentary background mineral profile. In the mouth it’s medium-light bodied, fruity-sweet in the way of orange and apricot and red delicious apple, finishing sticky, bitter, and peppery.
Red Rock Amber Ale (American Session Ale);Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Red Rock Brewing;Draft. Head is initially small, frothy/fizzy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium amber. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately hoppy (apricot, grapefruit), with a note of red currant. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively/fizzy carbonation. One of the better draft offerings at Red Rock, so it’s understandable that it’s one of their mainstays. Yeah, it’s still kinda thin and the carbo is kinda prickly, but given the limitations it’s a solid brew with plenty of aroma and flavor.
Red Rock Amber Ale (American Session Ale);Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Red Rock Brewing;On tap at Red Rock, pours a clear amber with a small beige head. Aroma and flavour of light hop resins and toasted caramel. Not too bad, but very weak. Decent for what it is.
Red Rock Amber Ale (American Session Ale);Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Red Rock Brewing;Draft. Copper beer with a dark cream head. Light malt aroma. Grapefruit and light pine flavor. Medium bodied. Grapefruit and light pine linger with light grain astringency.

Bäre-Bräu Witwe;Bern, Switzerland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bäre-Bräu;5.6% version - cloudy pale orange colour, few foam, spicy with notes of vinegar, medium-bodied with some acidity, long dry spicy and wheaty finish
Bäre-Bräu Witwe;Bern, Switzerland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bäre-Bräu;"Cloudy golden colour, poor head. Pretty nice aroma (some malt and coriander). Quite different from a regular Belgian White, pretty good in the mouth, but still with some yeast and metallic taste; anyway, it has some good malt, some sweetness. The most interesting feature is a quite good hopping. Beers of Switzerland"
Hasli Helles;Langenthal, Switzerland;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brau AG Langenthal;yellow colour, nice head and lace, few hops in the nose, herbal, medium bitterness, dry finish
Hasli Helles;Langenthal, Switzerland;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brau AG Langenthal;Hasli Spez, 2004-03-08, 6-3-7-4-14 Clean blond color. A nice note of malt in the nose. A good taste of pilsner malt, some sweetness, smooth, a bold long palate. Well hoppy, the most interesting from the brewery, and the only one to really feature the hops. Helles naturtrüb, 2002-09-24, 8-5-7-4-15 Beautiful golden-orange colour, nice head, but reducing quickly. Nice hop and malt aroma, honeyish when warmer. Good body, supported by a good malt, a residual sweetness, a very light fruity taste (like dryed apricots). It presents a pretty strong hopping, good but the palate just misses some more aromatic hop. Comparing it to a similar one (Haldemann Export), this one has more malt character, stronger body but less interesting hop.
Sainsbury's Premium Badger Ale;Holborn, Greater London, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sainsbury's;Hmmm. This seems like a passable all night drunk festival beer, but only because of its inoffensive and immature taste. It was a little forgettable, but I like the bottle design I guess. What else? Didn't really taste like a dark ale I thought, no coffee or liquorice that I noticed...
Sainsbury's Premium Badger Ale;Holborn, Greater London, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sainsbury's;...........................................................................
Sainsbury's Premium Badger Ale;Holborn, Greater London, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sainsbury's;I have fond memories of Badger beers from holidays in Dorset (apart from the reluctance of bar staff to use Hall & Woodhouse beers in shandies - any decent barperson should be able to pull a shandy using real ale). This metallic brown and watery drink, despite a pleasant warm after taste, has more memories of Torremolinos than Lulworth Cove. Brewed for the UK supermarket chain Sainsburys.

Ganser Kölsch;Leverkusen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Ganser Brauerei GmbH & Co.KG;Honestly I don’t really rememeber it that well anymore since I’ve got some more great beers before that evening. It has got a light golden colour, low steady head and medium body. Taste of mild bitter hops, mild ligt barley, mild lemon fruits and straw. Easy and nice to drink but it just lacks body, character and deepness. Average one.
Ganser Kölsch;Leverkusen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Ganser Brauerei GmbH & Co.KG;Bit bitter in the end but with decent spices and a bit of fruity aromas. Decent one with nothing special in.

Kurfürsten Maximilian Kölsch;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Kölner Verbund Brauereien (Radeberger Gruppe);Geschafft. Dies ist das letzte (Original) Kölsch, das noch in normalen Gaststätten angeboten wird, das nicht nur für Großveranstaltungen gebraut wird. Alle anderen hab ich schon getestet. Ziel vorerst erreicht. Das Kurfürsten Kölsch war nicht so gut, mal schaun ob die edlere Variante besser abschneidet. Der Antrunk ist leicht fruchtig und gut bekömmlich, der Mittelteil überrascht mit einem perfekt ausgewogenen herben Aroma. Der Nachgeschmack ist, wie der Rest des Bieres auch, recht mild. Er bildet mit einem angenehmen dezenten malzigen Aroma den Abschluss eines wirklich gelungenen Bieres. Es wird leider nicht mehr in der Bügelflasche angeboten, sondern nur noch in einer Hand voll Gaststätten in Bonn ausgeschenkt. Außerdem soll es nicht mehr lange existieren, was meiner Meinung nach ein echter Verlust wäre. Test vom 29.12.2005, Gebinde: Fass Noten: 11,13,15,13,-,13 - 13,10

Special Katje;Boezinge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Leroy;Old-fashioned ’dubbel’ with light beige, stable head and very dark ruby brown colour, clear. Aroma of coffee grounds, bitter chocolate, walnuts, sherry, cloves, tomato, iron. Fruity taste, smooth and nutty, dryish, with coffee-like roasted bitterness in the finish, but little hops. One of those remnants of a bygone era in Belgian beer history, when ales just had to be good and decent, without further ambitions of complexity - and I have nothing against that, this type of beers deserve their place among the newer, more ambitious brews.
Special Katje;Boezinge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Leroy;Dark amber/brown colour. Sweet malty taste. Aroma of caramel and brown sugar. Very watery. Thin body.
Special Katje;Boezinge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Leroy;Bottle @home. Pours amber coloured with a white/cream coloured foam. Aroma had caramel and herbs.

Very shy hops, watery overall. Drinkable like a grocery store pils or Palm - This beer went right down&under amidst the exceptional brews @BBF 2013.
Special Katje;Boezinge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Leroy;Bottle sample @ 19de Internationale BierHappening, Zottegem. Cuivrée, col fin beige. Arôme malté, léger grillé, rappelle un peu une version plus forte de la Jupiler Zero avec ici une note agréable de grains et de drêche. Palais est similaire, malté léger, le tout est supplanté par ce côté grains, brassin sortant juste du tank. Pointe de sucre brun, belle effervescence avec un petit clin d’œil café discret. Bière qui au final n’est pas bien méchante, simple et efficace et pour moi, s’en retrouve meilleur que d’autres grands noms des pils belges. Garde cette fin de bouche rappelant une bière de table plus centré grains et malt.
Skagit River Huntsman Oktoberfest Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Skagit River Brewing Co.;"Draught at St. Augustine’s, Vancouver Hazy amber color. Light aroma, but the malt flavor is more pronounced than in other beers within the style, with a hay and grassy touch, and slightly-above-average bitterness; biscuity and roasted hints too, roasted peanuts. Nice."
Skagit River Huntsman Oktoberfest Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Skagit River Brewing Co.;Draught in a flight at the brewpub. Pours a clear amber color. Nose has some grains and toast coming off it. Taste is slightly bitter and toasty, and seems quite nice. I liked this more than I typically do for the style.
Skagit River Huntsman Oktoberfest Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Skagit River Brewing Co.;Reviewed from old notes. Gee weez, I had this before I lived in Alaska. Thank you to Tom for sending this to me when I lived in Maine. This was poured into a pilsener. The appearance was a light copper to orange color with a one finger white foamy to bubbly head that dissipated leaving barely any lacing and what there was - was kinda all over. The smell had a light toffee and caramel with a buttery note to it along with a biscuity malt to it. The taste was basically the same with a light spiciness in and out of it. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Overall, not a bad Oktoberfest, but not one of the better ones. Still, I wouldn’t mind trying more from this brewery.

Skagit River Huntsman Oktoberfest Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Skagit River Brewing Co.;Draught pint at Redbones on 10/24/07 Interesting to compare this one to the Anacortes O-fest immediately preceding this....This one is much lighter, more apt for the style, with a lighter tan-peach appearance and stronger beige head. Little/no lacing. Clarity is high. A strong sweet-and-sour effect from the melanoidins is felt instantly, in the nose, with a toffee and buttercream sweetness growing steadily behind it. Fruitiness climaxes, with added hop pepperiness giving a light spicy tinge. Bread and dough soften the finish, and there seems to be a more, if very sweet, appropriate array of o-fest qualities here. But then I take a sip and, while it’s not roasty, or strangely malted, it’s VERY sweet. Sugary/caramelly malts are plastered to the palate, as carbonation works furiously to cleanse. Melanoidins pile on, giving vivid nightmares of death-by-fruits (the hops adding to this as well). Ok, so I’m exaggerating for effect, but in the end, this one seems to fail just like the Anacortes, but for different reasons. While the Anacortes had the wrong malt notes, this one gets them right, but lacks attenuation badly. Rather crude. No alcohol noted.

Skagit River Huntsman Oktoberfest Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Skagit River Brewing Co.;Tap - Eastside Club Tavern - Olympia, WA Aroma – Light malt aroma like this was missing something. Had a very light malt and spice background. Appearance – Amber in color and clear with a nice head. Flavor – The flavor was light and missing the overall affect of being an Oktoberfest. This was more like a lgith ale than a Lager. No real big flavors to experience. Palate – Wa nice and easy to drink but the overall lager Oktoberfest affect was missing Overall –I think this was over sparrged and just was missing some of the deep Oktoberfest flavors.
Skagit River Huntsman Oktoberfest Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Skagit River Brewing Co.;Tap at Fremont Oktoberfest. Copper color. Sweet caramel malt aroma. Toasty caramel and nutty flavor with some sweetness followed by a dry crisp finish.

Skagit River Huntsman Oktoberfest Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Skagit River Brewing Co.;Draft at the Barking Dog. Pours a deep mahogany-tinged amber. Thick moussy greyish head. Nice c-hop on the nose, sitting as the pudding in a cloud of nicely restrained malt. No caramel tsunami here, and more’s the pleasure. Maybe it’s not really an o-fest. Maybe it’s not something you should tell your friends from Bavaria about when they come over. But it IS really good as a food/session beer. Familiar caramel and toffee malt pleasures, but subdued the way they probably should be. There’s hop balance, too. It tastes like there are a full four ingredients in this beer, which is a problem too many o-fests don’t solve. Plus, it’s from Skagit River, and it’s well-balanced. And, bless ’em for their triumphs, that’s saying something. It’s a little shoddy to compliment a beer for what it isn’t, but navigating the potholes of a style successfully is part of the brewer’s art. This is a great little drink-any-month-of-the-year beer. No October ghetto here.

Skagit River Del Rio Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Skagit River Brewing Co.;"Draught at Naked City, Seattle, as Delrio Lager Pale blond color, hazy. Very nice aroma, delicate, corn and cereals, crispy. The flavor tends to be similar but less interesting, with a papery edge; dry mouthfeel, with correct bitterness. A respectable Lager; and at this gravity, a good choice."
Skagit River Del Rio Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Skagit River Brewing Co.;"On tap at the Radiohead concert in Seattle last night. Yes, I rated a beer at a concert. I am that beergeeky. Aroma is corny, grainy, dull. Pours clear gold with a quickly dissipating medium white head. Flavor is pale lager with a bit more hop character. Lightly sweet and finishes faintly bitter. Tastes a little grainy. Starts out highly carbonated but goes completely flat towards the end of the glass. The brewery claims this has more ""soul"" than the major brewers, but I would be hard-pressed to differentiate this from those macro beers in a blind taste test."
Skagit River Del Rio Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Skagit River Brewing Co.;Clear piss yellow color/ white head.

Aroma of golden and crystal malt, light citrus zest, some fruity character and a touch of honey.

Boundary Bay Harvest Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boundary Bay Brewery;Ruby-maroon with firm head amounting to a lovely pint. A bit too hoppy for a harvest season ale. Chinook appears in aroma.
Boundary Bay Harvest Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boundary Bay Brewery;"Draught pint at Redbones on 10/24/07 A very deeply burnished copper-red body is lightly hazy, with a fairly dense, beige head atop. Moderate retention, light lacing. Toasted malt and hops! Breadiness rolls through the nose, as straightforward C-hoppiness takes over and piles on lots of stiff citrus. Not particularly varied or interesting, it just seems rather uninspired. Malt apparency is low, other than contributing more dryness to the already dry, acidic nose. Some light caramel and dough notes, but nothing to distract from the heavy citrus dominance. Clean, though, otherwise and no alcohol is noted. Medium strength of aroma. Fruitiness starts up initially; some cherries, red apples, strawberries but is quickly curtailed by the stronger white grapefruit and orange bitterness. Soft, yeasty texture but with minimal comfort from any real malt suppleness. Grainy and bready on the finish, with hop acids steadily fatiguing the palate. Tastes like dry graham crackers and marmalade by the end. No alcohol or flaws. Too bitter, needs more malt balance/complexity."
Boundary Bay Harvest Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boundary Bay Brewery;On tap at the Parkway Tavern in Tacoma. Dark bronze pint with a tight foam head. Nose and first sip made me think... mmm, Deschutes Jubel. But, getting further into the glass, the lighter body and maple sugar overtones became apparent. This makes a fine fall beer.

Boundary Bay Harvest Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boundary Bay Brewery;On tap at Anthony’s Woodfire Grill in Everett. Pours a dark amber color with a nice white head on top. Aroma is full of malts, caramel mostly with hoppy undertones. Flavor is pretty mild and mostly sweet rather than hoppy. I was expecting this to be more of a hoppy beer being a harvest ale but it wasn’t the guess. However it is a pretty good beer nonetheless.

Deschutes N2 Killarney Irish Dry Stout;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout - Dry;Deschutes Brewery;A seasonal at the brewpub in Bend, this is not nearly as heavy as the Obsidian Stout.

Nice malty roasted flavors and with such a low alcohol content, this is easy to drink in quantity. A nice summer stout.

Alpine Tamarack Dunkel;Oroville, Washington, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Alpine Brewing Company (WA);Appealing red amber color, but with zero head retention. Feint, stale (nutty?) maltiness with a nutty flavor and rusty finish. After a second tasting, I noticed more of tha balance and barrel maltiness. It has an offkey nutty finish which can be slightly unpleasant. A middling craft dunkel.
Alpine Oktoberfest;Oroville, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Alpine Brewing Company (WA);Chuck’s 85th, Seattle. Rather clear dark orange, white thin foam. Eggy, bitter lager aroma. Alright sip, bitter finish to a balanced sweet malt bill. Ok spicy body. Not bad.
Alpine Oktoberfest;Oroville, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Alpine Brewing Company (WA);Draft pour at 192. Pours a thin orange with no head. Kind of an over sweet aroma.

Alpine Oktoberfest;Oroville, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Alpine Brewing Company (WA);Pint @ 74th St. Ale House. Tastes OK I suppose. Rather thin and not really much to it.

Dieu du Ciel! Grand Messe;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Un corps plutôt rougeâtre et un anneau de mousse. Des parfums qui frappent. Des feuilles en décomposition et de la terre stagnante minimalement soutenues par des céréales grillées. Un goût inintéressant fabriqué par des houblons agressifs et par une flaveur étrangement cartonnée. Un corps de faible densité avec une texture mince. Un pétillement normal. Une finale qui brutalise mes papilles avec une amertume non-identifiable. Il me semble que cette bière expose un caractère drôlement problématique. À reboire pour confirmer le tout? Non merci.

Équinoxe d'Automne;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;On tap at the Dieu du Ciel 14th anniversary party, pours a dark, dark amber with a large beige head. Aroma is quite smoky, with smoked roasted malt, but not too burnt or ashtray-like. Flavour is moderate smoky, with lots of smoked malt and loads of caramel malt to balance and take out the smokiness. A lot more moderate in the smoke character than many of this style, with a lot more caramel malts. This is certainly a good thing in my books, making this quite drinkable.

Pours a clear orange with a medium sized creamy beige head. Huge smoke on the nose, woody and full of campfire. Big smoke gives way to a somewhat saccharine sweetness, smoke and toast. A bit too sweet on the finish, caramel and more smoke. Almost a burnt marshmallow note.
Dieu du Ciel! Équinoxe d'Automne;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Draft at Blind Tiger with Andrew, Streets, Mark, Ben and Kyle. Pours a deep brownish black body with thin off white lacing. Aroma is smoked meat and band-aids. I’m not a huge fan of band-aids. Mouthfeel takes a turn for the win, with insane notes of savory meat - think pulled pork from Fette Sau! Insane meat flavor. Obviously, you can never drink more than a few smoked brews, but this has got to be one of the best.

Dieu du Ciel! Équinoxe d'Automne;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;(Verre de dégustation) Le liquide est ambré. Un simple anneau de mousse flotte sur la concoction. Au nez, la fumée de viande, qui est bien évidente, laisse une place à des malts caramélisés. Le goût me semble légèrement différent : les saveurs fumées et caramélisées sont touchées par des fruits. En bouche, le liquide a une tenue correcte avec un pétillement approprié et une texture légèrement collante. La finale se fait sur des notes sucrées et enfumées. Intéressant.

Dieu du Ciel! Équinoxe d'Automne;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Draught at Dieu du Ciel, Montreal. Dark brown, small to average and mostly diminishing light brown head. Moderate, malty and sweetish aroma, roasted malt, caramel and smokiness and some bacon. Body is medium, malty and sweetish flavor, caramel, some smokiness and faint bacon. Finish is average, malty and sweetish, caramel, faint smokiness. Really nice smoky aroma with bacon (Bamberg style), flavor/finish lacks the bacon - smokiness, too much caramel in the finish.

Gusto dulce, café, caramelo, algo a chocolate, regaliz, barrica y ahumado. Retrogusto un poco áspero y seco siempre dulce. Una doble que parece una cuádruple pero le falta cuerpo y complejidad. No está mal pero no me convence del todo el sabor, quiza por el toque a regaliz.
Adelardus Trudoabdijbier Bruin;Sint-Truiden, Belgium;Dubbel;Brouwerij Kerkom;Sample from 33 cl bottle. Deep mahogany colour with a medium sized white head. Fruity aroma with yeasts, fruits, caramel malts and grasses. Taste is light sweet. Medium body with a creamy texture and a soft carbonation. Finishes dry and fruity.
Old Chimneys Golden Jubilee;Diss, Suffolk, England;Strong Ale - English;Old Chimneys Brewery;"A pleasant enough brew with a satisfactory balance of hops and malt. Quite light considering the strength. Sadly disappointing considering the small size of the bottle and a rather pretentious Lot Number printed on the side; all designed to make you feel you are buying something a little special. Old Chimneys make decent beers, but nothing outstanding, even though they appear to be trying hard!"
Old Chimneys Greenshank;Diss, Suffolk, England;Strong Ale - English;Old Chimneys Brewery;Note to Old Chimneys Brewing: do NOT make your packaging so idiosyncratic that each bottle looks like it came from a different brewer. A strongly hopped brew that's got even more Old Kent Goldings than their Golden Pheasant - and that's saying something! Alcohol is well hidden behind the hop barricades.
Old Chimneys Greenshank;Diss, Suffolk, England;Strong Ale - English;Old Chimneys Brewery;Small East Anglian brewery formed in 1995 by ex-Greene King brewer Alan Thompson using only natural ingredients, and doing eveything by hand, including the bottling. This malty sweet beer leans toward a barley wine but is well balanced by dry, flowery hops. There is a grainy quality throughout, but most pronounced in the dry, lingering finish. A well made and pleasant beer that sadly lacks character.
Titletown Oktoberfest;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Titletown Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub bar and served to a pint glass, sporting a clear copper color, off white, bubbly head foam, and ribbony lacing. The aroma presented a clean lager nose, with German malt, light toastiness, and a little nuttiness. The flavor added a touch of noble spice, light sweetness, moderate bitterness, along with medium carbonation, in a medium body. A well done, tasty fall brew.
Titletown Oktoberfest;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Titletown Brewing Company;Found this my rating of this in my wallet from when it was released this year. According to Dave (brewmaster) this year’s Oktoberfest was a different recipe then the Karlsburg. Anyway, they do share some similarities and it starts off with a very sweet, caramel bouquet that is almost borderline caramel apple. Taste is sweet caramel malt, light cane sugar, and light hoppiness. Carbonation is moderate and the beer is medium bodies. Excellent beer and one of my favorite Oktoberfests.
Titletown Oktoberfest;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Titletown Brewing Company;An annual release from Titletown, and this years (2007) was fantastic. Consumed at slightly cooler than room temp, it pours a deep amber body with aromas of apples, honey and watermelon. A large frothy head that is very silky and a creamy body all the way through. Very impressed with this brew.
Titletown Oktoberfest;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Titletown Brewing Company;Octoberfest in early spring? Bring it on. On draught at the brewpub in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Pours a clear copper amber brew with a creamy off-white head that has a fast dissolving head that leaves behind some nice lacing. Aroma of malty multi-grain character with some toffee and flowery hops. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with flavors of multi-grain malt, toffee with a touch of brown sugar. Finish is semi-sweet, more malt than any hop character that quickly disappears during the finish. As a half-way marker for autumn Octoberfest, I hope to see this one back next fall.
Titletown Oktoberfest;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Titletown Brewing Company;A very winning interpretation of the Oktoberfest style. Not anticipated to last more than ten days on tap at the brewpub.
Gentle Bens Hefeweizen;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gentle Bens Brewing Company;Perfect hefe. Cloudy straw color, pepper and bread on the nose, tastes of bananas, cloves, lemon (no lemon slices here) and a faint bitter aftertaste. Nice.

Gentle Bens Hefeweizen;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gentle Bens Brewing Company;Pint at Gentle Bens. Smaller head than I expected, it looks like an Orange Julius, opaque and thick. Served with lemon. Not bad, taste has a lot of banana and a little clove, it looks thick and tastes thin. It’s more sour than sweet, no bitterness (some citrus as well). Not my favorite hefeweizen by a long shot, but drinkable.

Spice and yeast in the nose. Some clove, sweet fruits and esters in the aroma. The taste was a bit more bland. Wheat malts, light spice, hefe yeast and lesser amounts of fruit. Watery and thin body was quite disappointing. Grainy and sweet in the finish. The aroma was so promising, but the actual taste left a lot to be desired.

Golden Valley American Pale Ale;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Golden Valley Brewery;Slightly hazy yellow gold, strong thick white head.

Pours a hazy yellowish color with zero head. Aroma of citrus, mild hops, and caramel. Taste of grass, very mild hops and malts. The mouthfeel is thin and kind of soapy, very strange?

Golden Valley American Pale Ale;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Golden Valley Brewery;Larger hop profile than many pale ales. Not quite buttery like an extra, but enough mixture or styles. Earthier hops.
Golden Valley American Pale Ale;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Golden Valley Brewery;Bad bottle? Perhaps. Never has a beer looked so good and tasted so goddamn bad. Sour, yeasty, and excessively tart all woven into a beautiful hazy golden body with a mountainous, white fluffy head. Quality control in dire need.

Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt Pils;Ebermannstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt;0,5l Flasche. Überraschend dunkles Goldgelb. Weisser Schaum. Süss getreidiger Duft. Ein Hauch Apfel. Auch der Geschmack ist recht süss. Würzig-grasig. Im Abgang metallisch-herbe Noten. Unrund. Aber mir gefällt die klassische Flaschenoptik.
Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt Pils;Ebermannstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt;04-04-19 // 500ml bottle. Purchased at Landbierparadies Nürnberg. Brutal süffig. Leichte frische Citrus Note. Mild herb. Gefällt mir.
Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt Pils;Ebermannstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt;Draft at the brewpub. Clear canary-yellow. Hushed aroma of lemon peel, herbs and grass clippings. Some paper, soapiness and alcohol also show up. Firm and snug carbonation. Opens with a “candyish” Franconian yeast character that’s swiftly lifted by minerals and hop-derived nectar. A budding grassy and woody bitterness makes a memorable impression with its staunch smack. Touches of fennel candy help give the perception of sweetness and supply some heft to the quite slender body, but the lack of malt vividness and hoppy succulence is sadly felt. Prominent alcohol creates dissonance as it collides with the tannic, wet-grass bitterness. Nearly resinous in its stiff chalky bitterness, though a brightening splash of lemon juice offers temporary relief and much needed levity. The sharp finish is laced with hoppy acids and dry, toasty pils malt. I’d prefer much more hop flavor and malt support to help with the high level of attenuation. Could use some purification, but it’s certainly not a bad pils by any means.
Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt Pils;Ebermannstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt;“Schwanenbräu Pilsener“, vom Faß im Schwanenbräu, Ebermannstadt. - Sattes Bronzegoldgelb, klar. - In der Nase Bauernhofluft mit Kuhstall, Heu, etwas Butter. - Antrunk satt und weich hellmalzig mit Mischbrot und etwas Karamel. Milder kräuteriger Hopfen. Mild rezent, vollmundig, leicht mineralisch. Im Abgang zeigt sich ein gewisses Hopfendefizit: auch hier dominiert brotiges Malz, nur mild grundiert von zart kräuterig-zitronigem Hopfen. - Sehr malzweiches, rundes aber arg mild (doch fein) gehopftes süddeutsches Pilsener. Angenehm. Einen Pluspunkt gibt's für die individuelle Interpretation der Biersorte Pilsener.

Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt Pils;Ebermannstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt;My Bottom Line: Straw-like cereals and herbal hop bitterness try to make you forget about the hiding DMS, as mineral edges scratch every bubble. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam tops the clear golden. -The mouthfeel is dryish and softly carbonated. -Hops and malts aren’t clearly expressed. -Their beers taste like they’re trying to be a mid-sized, generic brewery. -There are so many very good Pilseners in Germany... This is not one of them. On tap at the brewpub.
Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt Pils;Ebermannstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt;"Draft at the brewery in Ebermannstadt. Classic appearance; sparkling gold with a fine white head. Clean toasted pilsner malt aroma. Mild to medium lemon / spice spalt hop profile. Clean fermentation; no noticeable brewing flaws. Soft dandelion / wildflower floral touches. Good malt expression, rich aroma and flavor. Enjoyable mineral / calcium crispness. Semi-sweet; lush carbonation; good hefty malt acid. Soft body, medium-heavy bitterness in finish. All around solid pils, clean and bright and expressive. Slight lemon astringency and husky malt keep it from being scored higher."

Thurn und Taxis Hell;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Orangy-lemon-coloured lager. The smell isn't as lagery as usual with helles, being a more citric-malt combination. It has its own distinct taste. The first impression is of crisp maltiness--as opposed to that cloying, honeyed maltiness you get with many Bavarian helles--no bad thing, by the way. There are some refined bitter notes holding the taste together like guide ropes, and as the glass warms then more bitter flavours join in. But overall, this is not a bitter beer at all, despite signs of hops in the citrus tones. Very likable.

Thurn und Taxis Hell;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);1) Bottle, August 2016. I'm guessing from Arden Wines. Classic herbal and honeyed fresh lager with bread stick, shrub and macaroon notes. Bright and heaped. Nose of fresh shrub, honey and mown grass. Subtly beautiful. Could happily sink a gallon and be sick all over myself. Unashamedly love this kind of stuff. 2) April 2018. Honeyed blossom and toasted cereal slickness. Slippery and gold. Tones of rubber, shrub sap, biscotti and macaroons. Muscular malt thick lager wafting softly with the summery fragrance of Munchen chestnut boughs. Innit? 737414

Dragonmead Erik the Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Dragonmead Brewery;Sampled on tap at the Detroit airport. Not much aroma, almost devoid of it. This is strange. Flavor is light caramel and biscuit notes. The toasy flavors are pretty good but the sweetness is a bit too much for my liking. I feel this beer could have used a touch more hops but I tend to like hoppy beers. Not bad but if I never have it again so be it.
Dragonmead Erik the Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Dragonmead Brewery;Bottle from Merchants. Aroma is caramel malt, metallic, earthy hop, some fruit, wheat, bready. Appearance is red, light tan head, clear. Taste is caramel malt, wheat, metallic, earthy hop, bitter, bready, mediocre. Mouthfeel is light to medium body, light carbonation, fruity caramel wheat bitter aftertaste. Overall, it's decent for a style where that's really all you can ask.
Dragonmead Erik the Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Dragonmead Brewery;From bottle. Clear red pour with a small off-white head and some lacing on the glass. Bready biscuit and caramel on the nose and tongue with plums and raisins. Mild and easy to drink. Very lightly bitter, a bit more sweet. Medium mouthfeel.
Dragonmead Erik the Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Dragonmead Brewery;Pours a nice ruby red with no foam head. Aroma is lots of caramel with some toast notes. Flavor is caramel and toast, with a crisp finish. Somewhat watery. Has enough going for it to make it interesting and enjoyable.
Dragonmead Erik the Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Dragonmead Brewery;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 2/22/2015. Pours slightly hazy reddish amber color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malts, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Irish red ale. All around good robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
Dragonmead Erik the Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap, poured into a chalice. The aroma is intially a light, dry bread note, which becomes more toast-like with caramel and citrus late. There are also some floral hints in there. It’s a slightly hazy, caramel brown color with a light tan, dense head that reduces to a medium ring with a light, wispy surface. Not much lace is left behind. The taste is a medium light dry with a bitter light sweet. The body is light and thin with a prickly carbonation. Flavors of caramel and grain come through on the palate, with some marmalade and a very light spice to the finish. The spice sticks around with light bread crust and zesty citrus notes in the somewhat clean aftertaste.
Dragonmead Erik the Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Dragonmead Brewery;Pours a cloudy amber color. Aroma and taste are very mild with some caramel.
Dragonmead Erik the Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Dragonmead Brewery;"Tap: deep, murky copper body with a slight red hue; small beige head on top leaves very little lacing on the way down. Aroma is very timid & mild... Doesn’t smell like much... Vague, slightly citric notes with a sweet & crystal malt tone. Taste has lots of almost-tart red apple with some kind of finishing spice that seemed a little like cinnamon? Very mild malty sweetness & some faintly citric hops,almost no bitterness. The taste was somewhat unexpected but pretty nice... A more robust aroma would do this one some good."
Dragonmead Erik the Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Dragonmead Brewery;Bottle. Reddish amber with some floaties. This beer is well...it’s just not good at all. I don’t really know how to describe the taste but metallic medicine is close. Very thin. Wow...
Dragonmead Erik the Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Dragonmead Brewery;A decent red, though lacking the charred malt character I associate with good Irish reds. That said... definitely malty. Not too sweet. Opaque amber with good head. Easy drinking. If you go on a day when it’s cask-conditioned, it’s even better.
Great Dane OJuniors Nitro Irish Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Taste: caramel malt, semi sweet, easy creamy velvet finish. Earthy, mild malt nose. Amber hue, clear, creamy head and nice lattice of lace. Medium/light body.
Great Dane OJuniors Nitro Irish Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Downtown location brewpub. Decent but needed to commit a little more to roasted malt, otherwise it just tasted a bit standard ale like. Serving: Tap
Great Dane OJuniors Nitro Irish Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at brewpub A very forgettable Irish ale might have not been the best option for a flight. On the bright side at least I did not have to drink a full pint before moving on to the final draft of the afternoon. A below average beer, this is one of those releases that is not so much overly full of glaring flaws as solidly pedestrian. Aroma / Appearance - A minimally carbonated base supports waves of vanilla head. Cream soda, vanilla, and light sweet ginger ale smell more like a cola than a beer. The aspects of caramel brownie provide a bit of a picnic dessert texture. Flavor / Palate - Caramel, vanilla, ice cream, and cream soda mix a bit of summer dessert with winter warmth. A smooth feel hits the throat briefly before it fades like snow on a 70 degree day. Overall this lacks any punch that makes it more than a footnote. Drink it for a tick then move on to styles that Great Dane does better.
Great Dane OJuniors Nitro Irish Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Dispensed to a house, imperial pint glass at the Doty location showing a clear amber color, with creamed colored, cakey froth, and wavy cling to the lacing much like the ESB presented. The nose was light grain, light toast crumbs, and a hint of caramel. Light bodied, softly carbonated, and moderately bitter. Very little character, an okay food complement, but more of an average hydrator for this sunny start to Madison’s Craft Beer Week.
Great Dane OJuniors Nitro Irish Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On draught at the Great Dane downtown Madison location, but not the nitro version. Pours a clear amber colored brew with a thin off-white head that quickly dissipates to a thin white ring. Aroma of caramel malt, some roasted nuts, a touch of grassy hops and some mild creamed corn. Taste is medium bodied, with flavors of caramel, grassy hops and a hint of roasted nuts. Finish has a mild metallic texture with some caramel and roasted nut aftertaste.
Great Dane OJuniors Nitro Irish Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Alright not what i was expecting at all. A dark but clear amber with a frothy white head. Tall adn creamy but quick to dissipate. Aroma is faint, soft floral notes, pecan and butter. Taste is sour! Tart, lemony citrusy uncharacteristically light and fruity. Back to the drawing board!
Great Dane OJuniors Nitro Irish Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at the downtown location. Poured a clear light orange color. The head was white. Overall, the aroma was understated. There was a whiff of light grains. Light bodied, smooth, and a little sweet. Tasted of grassy hop and bland cereal grain. So so.
Great Dane OJuniors Nitro Irish Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"On tap at GD - Madison. Poured a clear medium amber with a short, creamy white head. Aroma was of sweet, toasty caramel and nutty notes.. faint smoke and floral highlights.. OK, and definitely non-offensive. Sweet, toasty caramel again in the flavor with some cereal notes.. rather watery.. moderate floral bitterness and lingering sweetness at the finish.. very OK.. some mild diacetyl at the finish. Smooth on the palate, but had watery moments. Not bad.. but Blake’s crazy ;)"
Great Dane OJuniors Nitro Irish Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Call me crazy, but I liked this beer. Nitro. Pours to a coppery-light golden body with a very dense and creamy nitrogenated white head. Awesome lacing. The flavor is very nice. Cereals, corn flakes, crisp grains, nice bitter hops that are subtle in flavor, flowers. The aroma is grainy with corn cereals and simple grassy hops. The palate is richly creamy, nicely bitter on the tongue. The nitro really softens the mouthfeel to a satin finish. Call me crazy, but I’m with John on this one...
Great Dane OJuniors Nitro Irish Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at the downtown location. Clearish coppery body, medium off-white head. Light, sweet aroma with caramel and grassy hops. Sweet, cerealy body, with muddled caramels and sugared breads. Thin body with cloying sweetness. This beer seemed a bit oxidized and cardboardy, a death blow to this style.
Tugboat Czech Bitter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tugboat Brewing Co.;on tap at tugboat. you have to hand it to them for inventing a new style of beer. alas it was pretty stale with just a faint dandelion aroma and bare minimum of tinny bitterness
Tugboat Czech Bitter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Tap@Tugboat. Czeck bitter? well OK. This was OK i suppose, but it tasted a little stale. Dry and hoppy saaz, a little floral, and another odd flavour, but i couldn’t put my finger on it. A little stale.
Tugboat Czech Bitter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Draft: Litte citrus fruit nose. Orange yellow color. Distinct brewers bitter signature. Citrus lemon/ grapefruit with some malt. Clean, bitter, and dry. Very drinkable.
Tugboat Czech Bitter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tugboat Brewing Co.;A lovely golden color, slightly cloudy, with a thin white head. Nice mild hop aroma present. This was a lovely bitter , with a balanced profile from front to back. Not as over the top as some of their beers, this is a truely solid beer, and a definate session candidate.

Grand Union Special;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask conditioned handpull at The Knights Templar, JDW, Chancery Lane. Pale chestnut colour with lasting beige head. Looks in cracking condition. Crystal clear, lively head. Like all Grand Union beers, it’s solid. I will miss this brewery when it goes in the next week or so. Not sure if anyone will buy the brand and recipes, but the brew kit is going up north to the Wirral apparently. Hoppy aroma with some toffee/candy sugar. Absolutely fine in mouth, good sherberty hop finish. Toffee/nutty, good balance of ingredients. Solid
Grand Union Special;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask (The Met, London) Peach and grapefruit aroma. Sweet malt and fruity taste. Malty middle, and hoppy hints, and a pleasant long grapefruity finish - hints of burntness too there which surprised. Another beer not ruined by Wetherspoons, this is amazing!
Grand Union Special;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;A Mes rate: Cask at Baker St. JDW. Hoppy and citric. Pleasantly aromatic. Bit of malty balance. Obviously not a bad quality drink but it just doesn’t do anything for me.

Grand Union Special;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;JDW, Chancery Lane Gently sweet with a pleasant fragrant hop. A nice beer. The current Grand Union brewery team are putting together some good recipes and delivering quality ales.
Grand Union Special;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask@Crosse Keys, Central London. A bitter, but slightly more flavour to it. Some caramely toasty malt, with some nice slightly flowery hop characters. Earthy mouthfeel. Pretty decent stuff.
Grand Union Special;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Grand Union’s brews are certainly going up in my estimation. The first few I tried were in questionable condition at beer festivals. The last two have been in tip top condition at a pub. And they’ve been a revelation. Just a shame that they’re not easy to find on a regular basis in London pubs. The Special was a very handsome copper coloured beer. Well hopped, with floral notes in the aroma - perhaps some US influence? Hoppy flavour, with some underlying malt backbone. A good, dry best bitter with plenty of bitter grip and aromatic hops. Cask (handpump) at the Speaker, Westminster, London SW1.
Grand Union Special;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Bottled. Amber, thin white head and moderate condition. Low aromas of hop and toffee. Watery and bland in the mouth with some hop and malt. Aftertaste has some hoppiness and threatens to turn smokey but fails to deliver.
Grand Union Special;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;At first the mouthfeel is quite thin but the hoppy dryness redeems this beer. Not quite as good as Grand Union Best.
Grand Union Best;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Pours a copper colour ith some slightly yellow head. Quite a nice, spicey aroma and a fairly full initial flavour, some strong hop bitterness. It fades a bit fast, but I thought it was quite nice.
Grand Union Best;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask@London Drinker. Sweet, flat and dull. London Pride-esque flavour. Pretty average English bitter, sweet grainy caramel malts and some light floral hops.
Grand Union Best;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;A Mes rate: Gravicask at London Drinker. Birhgt amber colour, rapidly vanishing head. Plenty of hops but they just dont seem to have any class. Bittering finish. Fairly boring stuff.
Grand Union Best;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask gravity at London Drinker BF 07. Amber colour with thin off white head. Slgihtly farty aroma. Odd aroma. Decent bitter finish. Malts are ok but the aroma isn’t (my notes say something stronger abou the aroma).
Grand Union Best;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask dark gold ale. Quite heavily hopped, fruity ale. Short bitter finish, good session ale.
Grand Union Best;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Golden with shinny white frothy head, flat then on.

Grand Union Best;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;"Floral hops on the aroma. This is a ""festival-like"" real ale. Malts are light but the oily hops dryness is very good. One critisism - its a little watery."

Taiwan Draft Beer;Jhongjheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp;Draught at a beer stall on Hai’an road, Tainan, Taiwan - unsure of Pinyin translation. Straw gold with soda-pop carbonation and a short-lived, loose, white foam. Boiled rice, haybales, lemon zest and acidic apple juice on the nose. Carbonic acid bites hard on the tongue. Kept swirling the glass to rid it but this brought forth some manky liquor notes. Very light in flavour and body. Dusty, grassy hops evident that offer a light bitterness. Hint of grain, lemon and grapeskin, boiled rice and chalky starch. Phenols, acetaldehyde, soap - Not in good form. Just a well lagered lager really!

Taiwan Draft Beer;Jhongjheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp;Fairly clean lager, soap bubbly head, somewhat dry, tastes of malt and bread with no off flavors, rice. Very light on hops but floral.
Taiwan Draft Beer;Jhongjheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp;Better than the standard fair and just edges out the gold. I find this stuff is more gassy than it’s brothers hence maybe is more for general drinking than for eating ( although again like all TW beer it goes with food) . It’s hoppy and crisp with a ricey edge to it, the finish is mildly bitter. Like another guy mentioned it’s rare in Taiwan comparatively but is sold in Wellcome outlets. I can’t help thinking TW beer copied Heineken on most counts which is sad as this beer is probably better.
Taiwan Draft Beer;Jhongjheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp;Draft @ Taoyuan airport food court. Greenish-straw colour. Thick artificial foam that falls. Slow-moving bubbles. The aroma is strawlike, with light green apple notes and maybe some vague higher alcohols. Thin. Greenish notes, with hints of straw and not much else. Ah, random Asian swill, how I’ve missed thee.
Taiwan Draft Beer;Jhongjheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp;Draft @ Taipei airport. Clear greenish-yellow but decent head stability.

Taiwan Draft Beer;Jhongjheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp;This is a damn good beer when fresh out of the Taiwan beer factory at their pub in Taipei . Great beer when eating , wich I have said before Taiwan beer is made to eat with . Whats this baloney about cloudy beer? I have lived in Taiwan for 10 years and not once have I gotten a cloudy beer, or flat for that matter.
Taiwan Draft Beer;Jhongjheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp;"Not very widely available in Taiwan, very sporadic appearance in stores and restaurants. Appearance is typical pale lager. Aroma is herbal and aromatic. But there is a very tiny hint of sulpher that put me off a bit. Thin, very carbonated. Flavor: Rice dominates. Very weak traces of malt. There is some hop bitterness. The hop flavor is oily and herbal. Apparently the ""draft"" indicates that this is a very fresh beer. The beer was brewed 8 days before I drank it and it expires in another 6 days, according to the dates on the cap."

Yankee Lager;Jhongjheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp;Canned. Pale golden with no head. Papery adjunct aroma. Sweet with light body and no hops. Sigh.
Yankee Lager;Jhongjheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp;Can. As close to beer flavored water as you can get. A little white head was its best feature.
Yanjing Ice 12º;Beijing, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Beijing Yanjing Brewery Co.;Bottle brought and enjoyed in China. Small fizzy white head that mostly diminished. Much the same as the basic Yanjing beer, could not tell the big difference here. Light notes of sweetness and a hint of bitterness as well. Light bodied with an average carbonation. Light and soft finish.
Yanjing Ice 12º;Beijing, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Beijing Yanjing Brewery Co.;Can. A floral aroma. The flavor is dry but fruity and smooth. A little better than the regular Yanjing. I found this in Hong Kong.
Boon Rawd Leo Beer;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Boon Rawd;"Bottle of 32cl ?, in a Tumbler glass; from the fridge. A okay lager, refreshing. Nice pale golden colour. Usual malty aroma and taste."
Boon Rawd Leo Beer;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Boon Rawd;"The third of the top selling brands of industrial pale lager in Thailand, after Singha (by the same brewery) and Chang. Bottle from a Thai supermarket in the Ghent railway station neighborhood – (one of totally those unexpected ticks I suppose). Eggshell-white, thick and mousy, cobweb-lacing, foamy but thinning and eventually all but dissolving head, cristal clear and pure ‘metallic gold’ colour with lively sparkling. Aroma of damp straw, corn water, cold cooked rice, withering grass, damp kitchen cloth, soggy white bread, minerals. Sweet-graininess dominating, fizzy carbonation, very slick with that dull sweetish-maltose and cheap-grainy effect forming the main flavour – and basically the only flavour. Tad metallic, with still – and much to my surprise – a simplistic and brief, yet clearly identifiable grassy hop bitter accent in the finish; the sweet-graininess however keeps dominating, in a very ‘plain’ and one-dimensional way. Simple, industrial Asian lager as expected, perhaps a tad more hop bitter than ordinary Singha but otherwise in the same league. Not good at all, like any standard macro lager, but certainly not worse than expected either."
Boon Rawd Leo Beer;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Boon Rawd;Oct 2019. Bottle in Bangkok with Zelie. I've had this a few times yet somehow not rated it. Had it now as part of a taste test with Heineken, Singha, and Chang. They all taste the same. Standard global pale lager.
Boon Rawd Leo Beer;Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Boon Rawd;I'm a fussy beer guy.

Clear, dull golden bronze colour; Near zero head and thin residual white foam which fades in 5 seconds; Very small sticky lacing with some notable slightly carbonation; Smells of pineapple candy, pineapple syrup, sugar and soda; Sweet taste of , very light malt, with pineapple juice, watered pineapple syrup, sugar and shandy; Light body, watery palate; Mouth feel is very thin and light malt base, with thinned pineapple juice and pineapple syrup all the way, yet sweetness is not cloying at all. Otherwise, taste is simple, Shandy-like. Rice is not detectable despite being listed as an ingredient; No hoppiness to speak of, just light sweet pineapple finish; Wet after taste, very easy to mouth. Comments: This one is by far the least cloying and very agreeable to the tongue and teeth. That’s not much to speak of, but if you have tried the undrinkable syrup that is Zhujiang Pineapple Beer, this is a much more pleasant experience. Kinda okay, Shandy-wise."

Achilles Serafijn Trippel;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Tripel;Microbrouwerij Achilles;10-Nov-14 (750-ml bottle with copper foil: Purchased for $13.60 at O'Brien's in San Diego, CA) This Tripel pours a hazy, orange body and over an inch of off-white head that fizzes to a thin ring. The nose is sweet and honey-like, with candi sugar, mild spices, and bready malt. On the palate, it's flavors of honey, sweet bread, clove, bubble gum, and malt that is lightly toasty, doughy, and a bit grainy. The beer is full bodied, medium in carbonation, and a bit cloying after awhile. Overall, this is an okay Tripel but not particularly complex or interesting.
Achilles Serafijn Trippel;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Tripel;Microbrouwerij Achilles;Bottle. Hazy golden colour with small white head. Aroma of yeast and hops. Aroma is spicy and fruity with flavour of clovers and citrus,medum body and lively finish.
Achilles Serafijn Trippel;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Tripel;Microbrouwerij Achilles;Artisanal tripel (mind the incorrect spelling ’trippel’ on the label) with rocky, dense, snow white head (captured after fierce gushing) and hazy peach blond colour. Complex and strong aroma, a basket of exotic fruits, melon, orange, kiwi, banana, strawberry, tomato, aniseed, coriander, freshly grated ginger, field flowers, cheese spread, eggnogg and lavender. Delicately sweet taste, sparkling with relatively strong carbonation, smoothly evolving into a powerful, long, sticky, oily and cheesy hop bitterness (dry-hopping) bringing the whole to sheer perfect balance. Used to be quite famed among the well-informed beer adepts and I agreed with them: this is / was an underestimated masterpiece. Too bad for the gushing, though, so not completely flawless.

Asda Rusty Rivet;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;Asda (Wal Mart);Sept, 2002: Off-putting name, but a decent ale. This is light and refreshing, but with plenty of flavours. Not an outstanding beer, but quite cheap, pleasant and easy to get hold of. Good memories of drinking this in a caravan in Dorset.[2.5] Aug, 2003: Did a direct comparison with Newkie Brown which this obviously immitates. The Rivet was slightly redder, but otherwise the appearance was the same. The aroma on both is quite fruity with some rusty iron and stale peanut skin, but the Rivet is sweeter and fruitier with an element of blackcurrant sweets, parma violets and the body sweat of a fat alcoholic. The Rivet has the more pleasant aroma. The mouthfeel is similar. But the flavour of the Rivet is much tastier - very young and fruity, slightly sweet with the blackcurrants and parma violets stronger here than in the aroma. Finish is initially soft, drying into a gentle tannic finish with shades of iron. [3.3] Sept, 2004: Head to Head again with Newkie Brown, and the Rivet wins again. There’s some roasty notes which is moving this slowly in the direction of an Irish Red. It’s surprising how similar two beers can be, yet how one can be so much more tasty! [3.3]
Asda Rusty Rivet;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;Asda (Wal Mart);Bottled. Amber bronze, good lasting lacy white head and moderate condition. Caramel and delicate hops in the nose. Nutty caramel and slight metallic notes in the mouth with some saltiness towards the end. Peppery finish with a slight dryness.
Asda Rusty Rivet;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;Asda (Wal Mart);Quite sterile malty aroma. Rusty copper colour with virtually no head. Toffee malt flavour with a bitter hopped finish. Slightly rusty tinges. Similar to Newcastle Brown ale, but just a bit sweeter.
Asda Rusty Rivet;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;Asda (Wal Mart);light malty aroma, pours with a deep copper hue and small head, sweet malty flavour, minimal carbonation, reasonable brown ale.
Friedenfelser Zoigl Schwarzer Ritter Dunkel;Friedenfels, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Schlossbrauerei Friedenfels;My Bottom Line: Rye-like spiciness adorns this Dunkel’s slick caramel malts, as mild fruity acidity meets delicate herbal hop bitterness. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam covers the shiny dark amber. -The nose is deeper than the flavour profile, methinks. -The soft effervescence from the bottle lets the malts express themselves properly. -Drinkability is optimal, yet I would go back for their Zoiglbier if I were in the mood for a lager here.

Würth Helles;Windischeschenbach, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Würth;Golden and sparkly with a fairly thin head by Bavarian standards. Somewhat herbal character with lean, strawlike accents. Dryish character is almost pils-like until the finish, which gets sweet and almost sticky from pale malt.

Würth Helles;Windischeschenbach, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Würth;From tap. Bit soapy aroma. Sweetish, malty taste with ornage. Low on carbon. Just a hint of hops in the aftertaste.
Würth Dunkles Zoiglbier;Windischeschenbach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Würth;Bottle from the brewery. Nose is caramel, orange, spices, dark bread, an a touch of chocolate. Pours a nearly clear orange-brown with a low, thick head. Flavor is sweet and also tangy, orange, caramel, bread. A bit weird tanginess there doesn't seem to belong. Rather thin body. Finish is orange tartness. Started ok, ended somewhat disappointing.

Würth Dunkles Zoiglbier;Windischeschenbach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Würth;Sampled at Schoilmichels Zoigl stube. Small light brown head. Clear dark amber color. Fine light roasted malty aroma. Small caramel sweetness and a medium bitterness.
Würth Dunkles Zoiglbier;Windischeschenbach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Würth;50cl fliptop. Bb07/2017, Edeka Tirschenreuth. - Proof to the locals’ thesis that all bottled, larger brewery Zoigl are bandwagon beers... - Pours an inviting enough deep mahogani-amber. Earthy, sulphurous going on farty aroma of spent plum pudding, old pumpernickel, cow fodder. Regains interest on the palate with some dark bready dryness, then adds very little in the way of fruit, spice or mouthfeel to hold it. Drinkable liquid bread.
Würth Dunkles Zoiglbier;Windischeschenbach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Würth;Bottle, best by March 7, 2016: Clear, burnished copper. Sticky and fluffy head. Pleasant aroma of minerals, breadcrust, airy phenols, hazelnut, apricot, spicy Hallertau, burnt toffee and candyish yeast. Hint of rustic sulfur, as well. Loose and prickly carbonation. Quite minerally and bracingly dry, initially. Splash of plum jam gives way to a more acidic fruit dimension akin to plum skin which is offset by a faint punch of melanoidins. Malt is fairly succulent and is cradled beautifully by the very clean fermentation. Assertive snap of herbal and woody Hallertau brings to mind sassafras and licorice root as it stiffens the clean and firm body. Nice and peppy throughout, owing to the abundance of brisk minerals. Well-attenuated finish is pillared by rich breadcrust and a refined medley of soft and starchy pils-derived hay dust textures. No complaints here other than the thin mouthfeel and occasional wax notes. Very fun to smell and quaff, overall. It’s nice to find a bottled Zoigl that exudes authenticity, unlike most of the posers out there. A quality lager.

Steelhead Undertow Porter;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Porter;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Roasted nose that promises more than it delivers. The flavor is rather bland and beer has thin body
Steelhead Undertow Porter;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Porter;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Bland brew, not very roasty as advertised, definitely could use some spicing up. Just boring and uneventful. I thought the palate was okay but other than that I have nothing good to say about this beer. Tastes manufactured without much thought or passion, kind of like the rest of this pub...
Steelhead Undertow Porter;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Porter;Steelhead Brewing Co.;"Tastes a bit like water and vinegar. As far as I know beer shouldn't taste like that! Definitely doesn't meet the claimed description of ""sweet and carmely with a deep dark roasty toasty undertow"""
Tahoe Organic Amber Lager;Truckee, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Truckee Brewing Co./Pizza Junction;YUCK!! I don''t know if I bought a bad bottle of this stuff or what. It tasted like cider, way too sweet! It did not taste like beer at all. Thin body and a head that disappears in half a second. Very disappointing. I hope that this beer is not a reflection of the rest of the Truckee beer because if it is, count me out!
Tahoe Organic Amber Lager;Truckee, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Truckee Brewing Co./Pizza Junction;Amber color, small head. A light bodied amber. Light malts, not very hoppy, slightly sweet. Not much flavor or taste, but what is there is nice. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly malt sweet.
Tahoe Organic Amber Lager;Truckee, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Truckee Brewing Co./Pizza Junction;This is really difficult to rate... I hope we bought a bunk beer cuz this tastes like a wine but not really. Doesn't resemble beer in the least.
Pardubice Boom Extra;Pardubice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Imperial;Pardubický Pivovar (Molson Coors);Bottle… Clear amber lager with a small, fizzy, vanishing white head. An easy pour left lots of muck in the bottle. The nose consists of sorghum, palmetto honey, toffee and medicinal alcohol. Full of unlikely, unfortunate and unidentified esters and phenols. Full-bodied with soft carbonation. Boozy and sweet with light molasses. Not much in the way of hop bitterness, but there’s a touch from the ethanol. Warming, bittersweet finish.
Pardubice Boom Extra;Pardubice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Imperial;Pardubický Pivovar (Molson Coors);Had this beer on 9/9/2002. Aroma is a mild malt scent and is a lighter scent than the regular Boom. Color is a nice gold with good carbonation and a thin head. Taste is mild and sweet. Starting with a light medium body it goes down with a crisp refreshing feel. Finish is a light malt flavor with a strange sweetness that you can taste the alcohol in. The lable states that this is a Malt Liquor. It fits the category of a Malt Liquor and as such its the best one I’ve had. I am not a big fan of Malt Liquors, because most of they suck, but this is a very drinkable beer. I would like to note that it does feel lighter and more refreshing than the regular Boom but is a bit sweeter.
Pardubice Boom Extra;Pardubice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Imperial;Pardubický Pivovar (Molson Coors);This is a huge beer, almost to the point of being like some high gravity macro lagers. Has a kind of simple flavor, doughy with a bit of grassy hops. Some strange fruitiness and finishes with a bit of spice. Odd...
Pardubice Boom Extra;Pardubice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Imperial;Pardubický Pivovar (Molson Coors);At 8% alc/vol this brew packs a wallop just like the semtex plastic explosive made in the same town.Goes down smooth.Taste changes as this beer warms,pull out a cold one and sip on it over 2 hours. I swore i was drinking 6 different beers.Great price.Highly recommended.My bottlle said porter 8% on the cap.
Pardubice Boom Extra;Pardubice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Imperial;Pardubický Pivovar (Molson Coors);Dark golden to amber color with an off white plastic looking head. Aromas of caramel and mild dough laced with alcohol. Some light grassy hops. Somewhat thick in feel. Odd yeast flavors that make this seem like a keller brew. Pale malt, light fruit and a spicy alcohol component. Yet another in a rather long line of european strong lagers.
Pardubice Boom Extra;Pardubice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Imperial;Pardubický Pivovar (Molson Coors);poured a clouded amber with a smallish head. aroma of honey and spice. Very malty and sweet...wet finish. Alcohol hidden well...this is almost a doppleganger for Bavaria 8.6 in flavor profile. Not a bad beer if you like the strong Euro lagers...but I don’t thus the modest score.
Pardubice Boom Extra;Pardubice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Imperial;Pardubický Pivovar (Molson Coors);Bottle. I’m not sure....this just didn’t taste right to me. Not like it went bad or tasted like Anheuser World Select or anything, it just didn’t taste right. Or maybe it tasted like something I’m not getting. Possible re-rate
Pardubice Boom Extra;Pardubice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Imperial;Pardubický Pivovar (Molson Coors);Extra Boom. Sounds like a poor translation or something. Big American Party. Anyway, onto the beer. I froze this accidentally and when I drank it, it still had frozen spots. Tastes surprisingly good, at first. Might be better at this temperature tho, since others are saying it gets bad as it warms. Reminded me of Aventinus, something I wasn't expecting at all. It was good in my opinion. Cheap too. Those Czech know how to pack a punch.
Pardubice Boom Extra;Pardubice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Imperial;Pardubický Pivovar (Molson Coors);Appearance: clear, peachy color, a big, rocky, crackling head of foam that pares down quickly, into nothingness. Aroma: odd...fruity...medicinal, mineral...metallic...dry, with ocassional hints of orange and it too disappears, with haste, into the great unknown. On the matter of taste: flavor, there is, yes, but hard to categorize. Spicy, fruity, but in minute dosages. Texture is tiny. Definitely feels like a lager, body is slight, but not too,and malt is felt, in it’s way. Alcohol, a hefty 8%, takes time to present it’s force ...ooop, there it is! Starting to creep into me, now. Just enough taste here to make it worthwhile drinking, but not enough to make it worth returning to. Needs a lot more of a lot of things, to make for a worthy brew.
Pardubice Boom Extra;Pardubice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Imperial;Pardubický Pivovar (Molson Coors);Nice dark amber color,small off white head that faded quickly and left little behind.The aroma was mildly malty and mildly fruity with a definate alcohol hint coming through.The taste was nothing special Lightly malty with a good alcohol bite in there a decent fruity accent and some hops.The alcohol isn’t real bad but does get to be a bit much as the brew warms up.Not bad but then not great eather.It’s worth a try atleast once but for me once is enough,thankfully the price was right on this brew.
Solodov Klassicheskoe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);clear gold with medium sized creamy white head. look like corn syrup. corn flakes aroma. flavor is of sugar and corn flakes. well, at least i don’t have to eat breakfast this morning!
Solodov Klassicheskoe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Light golden color with a fluffy white head. Potato pancakes come to mild with grain and applesauce. Another industrial lager being thought a pils. Full Sickening sweet sugary syrup flavors. White grapes and stewed raisins mingle with a floral hops component that just adds to the sweetness.
Solodov Klassicheskoe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Bought a bottle of Solodoff Classic in Madison, Wisconsin. The brewer is Krasny Vostok, so I know I have the right beer. Light gold body with a white head. The aroma is potatoes and wheat flour. There is also some light dirt. The taste is sweet with sweet potatoes and some hints of carrots. There is an earthy and musty cellar character in this one. A nice light lager that is not offensive.
Solodov Klassicheskoe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Herbal hoppy aroma. Pale golden color, white head, good lace. Very sweet for a pils, light bitter, some sweet fruits like grapes or something. Not bad at all. Don't know why it gets low ratings by the others.
Solodov Klassicheskoe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Clean, fairly tasty pale lager with nice (artificial) head. Very big money are thrown in order to promote it.
Solodov Klassicheskoe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Bottled. Pale golden. At first a sharp, spicy, yeasty aroma is disturbing, but the sweet and mild, well rounded maltiness and salty finsih forgives it. Despite it's nose a decent enough lager roughly in the dortmunder style imo.
Solodov Klassicheskoe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Appearance like apple juice, a truly festering aroma, sickly sweet. A truly terrible beer.
Solodov Klassicheskoe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Limpid gold. Sweaty, slightly phenolic aroma. Light, fizzy body with slight appley notes and unwanted acidity.
Solodov Klassicheskoe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);Dark yellow. Yeasty with hints of hop in the nose. Sweet maltyish body, somewhat candyish.
Solodov Klassicheskoe;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);It traveled far from Russia so the freshness could be affected, even so was weak and unpleasant. It looks good, golden with healthy head, gaseous. Flavour unfortunately was not best.
Hawks Super Natural ESB;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hawks Brewing;Bright copper hue. Thinnish head, but it had an OK froth to it, and some lace. Aroma was inviting. Mouthfeel was soft and easy to drink. Malt profile contained a subdued sweetness, but it had some nice hints of fresh bread dough, light toast, cocoa and sugar cookies. Hops were somewhat citrusy (tangerine). Lesser notes of flowers, herbs and tea. Bitterness was on the mild side, but it was fitting and provided decent balance. Overall, this beer didn’t wow me too much. However, it was solid and had a nice earthiness about it.
Hawks Super Natural ESB;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hawks Brewing;22oz bottle. Poured a medium and cloudy amber color with a larger sized off white head. Aromas of nuts, toasted malts, toffee and some floral hops. Tastes of nuts, toffee, toasted malts, and a little earthy.
Hawks Super Natural ESB;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hawks Brewing;Cloudy brown with some ruby hints and a tiny little tan head. Aroma is slightly nutty and earthy. The flavor is kind of off and take a minute for your palate to adjust to. Some toasted malts, just a bit of smokiness, but has a somewhat grainey texture in the mouthfeel and just continues to have a murky quality all the way through. Its not a bad beer, but it nevers get anymore than what it is, very one-sided.
Hawks Super Natural ESB;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hawks Brewing;Very hazy tawny tan with little head. Very malty and lightly floral aroma. Rather astringent in flavor with some smoke and hops. Finishes watery.
Hawks Super Natural ESB;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hawks Brewing;hazy amber color,small off white head that faded quickly leaving nothing behind.The aroma was grainy and some what hoppy with maybe some light citrus in there.The flavor was decent but nothing special.Grainy at first with some dull sweetness coming through then a bit of hops in the end.The cruity side is there but nothing to potent but decent enough to make the brew worth trying again.It’s not a great brew but worth trying again at some other time.
Hawks Super Natural ESB;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hawks Brewing;Very cloudy amber in color with a big, fluffy white head. Swet malt aroma, very toasty, with some caramel - similar to a bells 20th anniv. Balanced flavor - the malts are sweet and grainy, some apples and pears, banced by mostly earthy hops. As the beer warms, this beer becomes more watery. Decent, I was hoping for more.
Hawks Super Natural ESB;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hawks Brewing;(22 oz bottle: $3.95 at Belmont Station in Portland, OR) After pouring this beer and taking a quick whiff, I can’t say I’m terribly enthused to taste this beer. It smells dry, toasty and nutty, but also a bit stinky. The flavor is all right though. I don’t recall a dry and very nutty maltiness being this dominant in any other ESB I’ve sampled. It’s minimally sweet, lightly sour, and the toastiness is dark enough to be bordering on mildly roasty. Also part of the malt bill is a moderate graininess. Hops is mild to moderate, with a balancing bitterness, but is more apparent in the finish. Body is medium, with good carbonation levels and a fairly clean palate. Brownish amber and hazy body is topped by an off-white head that rises to just under an inch in height, and then settles to a wide ring. Lacing is minimal. In the end, it’s not a bad beer, but the flavor just isn’t doing it for me.
Hawks Super Natural ESB;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hawks Brewing;Ruddy apricot. Even smattering of pasty ivory foam. Caramel-doused toasted hay and nuts in the aroma with a touch of fruitiness. Soft, lush carbonation fills the palate. Hard body. Initially grainy-dry and stiff, but vividly malted with a sumptuous foundation of caramel drenched nuts and starchy malt. Hard mineral astringency and earthy yeast compound the ensuing leafy edged dryness, but a sneaky kiss of tropical fruitiness and the unwavering caramel anchor lend the right amount of softness. Twinge of floral hop acidity somewhat lessens the body, but creates a caramel apple effect as it fuses with the malt sweetness. Plush caramel and biscuit expressions echo the chalky dryness as a muted stroke of earthy hops lingers. A very authentic creation. Thanks, Lucy!
Hawks Super Natural ESB;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hawks Brewing;Bottle. Moderately opaque, medium amber in color. Very nice, creamy white head forms and persists throughout the life of this beer. Good lacing. Aroma is moderately roasted grain, a touch nutty, some toast. Light hop aroma may lurk around but doesn’t really show through the malt bill. Medium bodied, somewhat dense. Nice roasted grain flavor, some nuttiness. Decent hop bitterness for an ESB, somewhat lingering. Well balanced, flavor seems to fade a bit towards the middle and end. Overall, a nicely made ESB.
Hawks Super Natural ESB;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hawks Brewing;Dry, nutty aroma, strong. Almost fruity. Cloudy orange, nice head. Good malty feel up front, but somewhat lacking in defining taste. Finish brings out a very nice bitter, dry, and nutty taste.
Myanmar Lager Beer;Mingaladon Township, Yangon, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Myanmar Brewery and Distillery;Canned, 330 ml, courtesy of Vlado. Shared with Miro B and JFK10000. Clear golden, short lasting white head. Bland and tasteless. Sweetish. Malty. Watery.
Myanmar Lager Beer;Mingaladon Township, Yangon, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Myanmar Brewery and Distillery;640ml bottle pours with a crystal clear gold body that supports a thin white head of foam. The aroma offers up apple and pear like esters and maybe a bit of apple pie. The taste delivers sweet apple and pear juicy esters that grow to midway as the carbonation sting subsides. There are vague faint botter hops in there somewhere too. Not terrible
Myanmar Lager Beer;Mingaladon Township, Yangon, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Myanmar Brewery and Distillery;A pale blonde lager with a thin lacing white head. In aroma, corn and rice adjunct, metallic hop, typical Asian swill. In mouth, watery bodied, light corn, faint hops, boring and weak. Can from a little store in Inle Lake.
Myanmar Lager Beer;Mingaladon Township, Yangon, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Myanmar Brewery and Distillery;33cl Can, thanks Thijs! Way past BB date. Clear golden colour, white head. Aroma of sweet malts, honey, light grassy. Flavour is medium sweet, malty, light grassy, soft bitterness. Light bodied. Not bad actually.
Myanmar Lager Beer;Mingaladon Township, Yangon, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Myanmar Brewery and Distillery;Cotts 2019. Low key marzipan aroma. Light gold. Thin translucent white head. Light bitter with a sweet edge. Thin. Light. Fizzy carbonation. Abrupt finish. Alright for the style.

Myanmar Lager Beer;Mingaladon Township, Yangon, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Myanmar Brewery and Distillery;Can shared at Cotts Convention V. Thanks to Nic for bringing it back. Pours clear yellow gold with a tjin white head. Aroma and taste of malt and grain. Meh
Myanmar Lager Beer;Mingaladon Township, Yangon, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Myanmar Brewery and Distillery;Can from the National Brewery Centre, Burton. Drunk at home. Light yellow with a greenish hue. Clear with a foamy white head. Strange odour: grains, metal, some astringent notes. Not a bad taste, actually, but very sweet and otherwise inconsequential. There's a sickly saccharine to the finish which kind of spoils the whole experience. A boring lager that's not quite a drain pour but not particularly enjoyable.
Myanmar Lager Beer;Mingaladon Township, Yangon, Myanmar;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Myanmar Brewery and Distillery;Can. Thank you Zvi and Nurit! Clear light gold with a white head. Aroma of straw, oxidation. Sweetish, apple, some sugar and vibegar. Light body, highly carbonated, sweetish finish.
Green Mill Apostle Island Amber Lager;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Hoppy. A bit sweet and malty, nice, but lacking any complexity beyond the first swig. Overcarbonated.
Green Mill Apostle Island Amber Lager;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Tap. Amber color. Mildly fruity aroma. Dry flavor with some hints of caramel in the flavor but ultimately an unsatisfying lack of flavor.
Green Mill Oktoberfest;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Tap. A nice seasonal beer. Spicy flavor and aroma. Dark golden color.....
Green Mill Minnesota Mild;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Amber. No aroma. Flavor like flavored milineral water. Overcarbonated (a theme of Green Mill beers). It misses the malty simplicity of an English mild. Worthless.
Green Mill Minnesota Mild;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Tap. Basically no flavor just some body and carbonation....................
Weesper Wit;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij de Horste;11/19/2009 1:04:00 PM Bottle from Cracked Kettle. Nice hazy amber body with lasting head. Sweet, hoppy nose. Hoppy taste with flavours of pine. Nice malt in the middle too. Sweet, syrupy finish. Well done.
Weesper Wit;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij de Horste;"Date: 07/07/2005 Mode: Bottle Source: Ale Atlanta cloudy dark yellow, whispy head, funky malt aroma, light malt flavor with some wonderful funky character, light body, slight lemony sweetness, Aroma: 5/10; Appearance: 5/10; Flavor: 5/10; Palate: 5/10; Overall: 10/20 Rating: 2.6/5.0 Score: **/4 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The score was calculated based upon the notes and an old scoring system."
Weesper Wit;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij de Horste;Well it’s definitely old so the rating is not completely accurate but I thought I would do the best I can. The aroma is sour and fruity with elements of cork, water, and wheat. The appearance is orange gold with no head because the beer is virtually flat. The flavor is like the aroma with a definite staleness. The palate is thin.
Weesper Wit;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij de Horste;Had this a long time ago and just found the rating. I have written: This does not seem like a witbier. Definitely smells like organic apple cider, pear juice, and spiced cinnamon, cloves, pepper, and yeast. Interesting. Flavor of rum and hot cider, corriander, pear juice. Slightly sour on the finish, like a vinegar taste.
Weesper Wit;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij de Horste;This brew was bottle conditioned corked and caged. I could not get the cork out of the bottleneck cleanly. I had to break off the top and use a cork screw to get the cork out, or what was left of it! It then poured a very small sized head of medium sized fully diminished clear bubbles that left behind an unnoted lacing. The body contained no carbonation, was slightly hazy and orange brown in color. Its aroma contained notes of very mild wheat and dough. Its mouth feel is initially smooth and flat with a slightly tingly mild alcohol aftertaste. Its flavor contained very little flavor and reminded me of a cider.
Weesper Wit;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij de Horste;Very glowing orange color to it. No head at all that i can see. Apple cider, pears and mild vinegar and cinnamon in the aroma. Starts off tasting alot like apple juice and then it gets a dry bitterness to it and it has some pepper hottness in it.
Weesper Wit;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij de Horste;Deep and muddy peach-amber hue with zero head. Heavily spiced aroma: clove, corriander, pepper, lavender and a bunch of others I’m not even going to attempt to define. Slightly pungent vinegar. Oranges, bananas, lemons. Very low wheat component in the aroma. Apple and Pear cider. Moderately sweet, moderately acidic flavor. Lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter (spices, mostly, I think). Mix of sour and tart acidity. Medium body, watery texture, almost no carbonation. Uhh, this is labeled as a wit (as of now) but this is a Gruit ale for sure. Gets sweeter and less spicy as it warms.
Weesper Wit;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij de Horste;Poured a hazy light amber color. I forgot how old they said this bottle was but it reminded me of an old ale not a wit. Sweet aroma and flavors of fruit and aged malt. It was tasty.
Weesper Wit;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij de Horste;Bottle, not sure who brought this to the recent Ale Atlanta, but many thanks to whoever did! Darker gold hazy pour. Spicy and heavy armoas and flavors, the yeast characterists overpowering most everything else. Didn’t seem very wit-like, but this must be due to its age. Still I found it drinkable.
Weesper Wit;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij de Horste;Bottle conditioned, corked and caged. Poured absolutely no head, no lacing, fine-small sized bubbles, uncarbonated, transparent, and a pale yellow-golden hue. Sweet, clove and some orange in the aroma. Flavor was sweet, syrupy, dry and some light clove. Smooth, dry palate. Light-medium body. Ended up being a drainpour. Not quaffable. Not recommended. Ick.
Batemans Blackbeerd;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;Tasted this in The Esquire House, Glasgow in November 2005. Cask, handpump dispense. Dull black in colour with a off white head. Dusty drinking chocolate and roast grain in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and poor lacing. Dark malts give a maltloaf base with coffe, bitter chocolate and roast coffee notes. Slight hint of damson fruit as well. Bitter hop resins present in the dry aftertaste which soon give way to a roasted grain note in the short finish. An ok session ale which tastes more like a mild to be honest?

Batemans Blackbeerd;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;This is a strange beer. Pours almost like a stout, with rich brown creamy head however disappears and reveles a ruby liquid. Aroma is seriously minimal with some lightly sour malts. Taste is mmm, what is goign on here, this is like a brown ale with soem sourness, lacking somewhat in flavour but the sort of red wine and a touch of vinigar give it character. Im wondering if this keg is slightlky off but i only tapped it 2 days ago so it should be fine, maybe have to try it again further through the keg.

Batemans Blackbeerd;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;Cask Conditioned at The Falkland Arms, Gt. Tew, Oxon. Dark brown beer with beige head. Looks good, but this is mainly a malt overdose, sweet and chocolate maltiness, some nut, some fruit. An attempt at a finish, but most of the flavours lose their impact.

Dragonmead Octoberfest Marzen;Warren, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dragonmead Brewery;Bottle. Light golden amber pour with a white head.

Dragonmead Octoberfest Marzen;Warren, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dragonmead Brewery;Interesting take on an Oktoberfest... not much malt presence. Vegetabley--notes of celery and carrot juice? Corn notes in nose and taste as it warms. Rather light hue for the style as well.
Dragonmead Octoberfest Marzen;Warren, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dragonmead Brewery;"Draft... Clear, amber lager with a small, frothy, white head. The aroma and flavor aren’t unpleasant, but I can pull almost nothing out of either…a shame. Don’t be shy with the malt; an Oktoberfest is supposed to be a big, fat, malt-bomb, beer party! Medium to full-bodied with a silky mouthfeel and almost no carbonation. Finishes clean. A bit of a disappointment, this."
Dragonmead Octoberfest Marzen;Warren, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dragonmead Brewery;"On tap in house. Beautiful golden amber appearance with a big white head. Slightly cloudy. Smells of hops and slightly acidic, maybe a touch of brown bread and alcohol? Has a wonderful opening flavor of very sweet malt balanced with a nice bitter alcohol flavor. Dries out somewhat, but this is still a sweeter rendition. Finishes with a creamy almost doughy malt flavor with some extra barley touches. Being brewed only a few weeks ago and fresh on tap helped this immensely. Finishes smooth and does not thin out. Flavor is complex but not terribly lingering. Could use some more depth in the malt; this isnt a dry oktoberfest, but Ive had better."
Dragonmead Octoberfest Marzen;Warren, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Dragonmead Brewery;"I tasted this last night and recorded my scores then. But I find myself tempted to raise them now. This is a world class beer. Its burnt coppery color and thin white head herald the coming of something superb. The aroma is filled with honey, grains, some toasted biscuit. I over use the term ""malt complexity"" and this beer make me want to rerate every beer I ever used that term with! It's lightly hopped and you can taste the pride of German workmanship in each noble hopped draught. Deep and rich, this beer does everything an Octoberfest should."

Dragonmead Broken Paddle Indian Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;IPA;Dragonmead Brewery;Tap: unfiltered, rustic golden-amber body with a very thin layer of white foam on tap that’s gone within just a few moments. Aroma is kind of nebulous, hard to discern anything specific. Some floral notes, hint of grapefruit, maybe some orange zest. I’d say it’s even more malty than anything... Almost caramel-y. You can smell the Munich malts. You can taste them, too. Sweet up front with a light induction of grapefruit, ashy hops, & some zesty orange rind in the finish. Caramel, toasted bread, & Munich malts abound. Not what I typically enjoy in an IPA... this one is just okay. Not awful, just okay.

Dragonmead Crooked Door Amber Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at Dragonmead. Poured an amber color with a smaller sized head. Caramel, lighter fruitiness, and a lighter hop finish.
Dragonmead Crooked Door Amber Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;First off let me say that I am disapointed by Dragonmeads brews at the present. I have gotten the impression that with the prices of their ingredients going sky high, they have cut back on the quantity of their ingredients in their brews. The end result is much weaker than usual brews. The aromas and flavors all appeared weak IMHO. With that said, on to the rating. This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy white colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a transparent softly carbonated light brown colored body and a poor lacing. The almost non-existant aroma was malty. The smooth mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start mediumly tingly at the finish. The flavor contained notes of malt mild hops mild brown malt and mild nut. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again.
Dragonmead Crooked Door Amber Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;Draft at Dragonmead.Very small head that quickly dissipated, no lacing, transparent, no carbonation observed, and an orange hue. Nose was malt, lightly hoppy, sweet and hint of caramel.Flavor mimicked the nose and was watery and thin.Smooth, watery and thin mouthfeel. Lght in body.Balanced but very thin flavored.Not impressive.

Dragonmead Crooked Door Amber Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;Tap. Deep, clear copper-colored beer. Malt dominant aroma with caramel being the main aroma component. Fair malt body, again caramel seems to be the main player, along with weak notes of hop bitterness, just enough to make a dent in the malt presence. Fair and typical amber ale.
Dragonmead Crooked Door Amber Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap: Weak malt and fruit aroma. Transparent amber with an okay off-white head. Weak malt up front with a weak grapefruit hop finish. Rather bland and watery. Not a whole lot of flavor in this beer. Real light.
Dragonmead Crooked Door Amber Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;Very red in color and very bland all over. A timid beer for timid drinkers, they even describe this as a beginners beer. Watery mouthfeel, watery finish. Only hints of sweet malt in the middle and a touch of hops at the finish. Boring.

Bitter and I did not get the sourness or wateriness, no question they got their act together on this one and that’s why it’s released over a year later. Good for its style.

Dragonmead Dubbel Dragon Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Dubbel;Dragonmead Brewery;"Tap: burnt orange-ish, amber body, not as mahogany as I’d expect from a dubbel... Hazy with a small, off white layer of foam on top. Aroma is full force Belgian yeast; bubblegum, light clove, fruity banana esters, along with some dark plum & raisin notes. Faint caramel & residual sugar in the periphery. Flavor is similar with notes of yeast, caramel, bubblegum, banana, plum, Candi sugar, raisin, & a slightly medicinal, phenol alcohol character. Decent dubbel from Dragonmead, though nothing particularly special about it."
Dragonmead Dubbel Dragon Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Dubbel;Dragonmead Brewery;Dark brown ale. Has a sweet yeast aroma and an even sweeter flavor - a little too sickly sweet. There’s also a hint of bitterness to add some complexity, so overall it is okay.

Dragonmead Dubbel Dragon Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Dubbel;Dragonmead Brewery;Nitro… RBSG 2010… Clear amber ale with orange highlights and a quickly dissipating head. The nose offers esters of banana and pink bubblegum alongside a clove-like phenol and malty notes of toffee, biscuit and caramel. Full-bodied and velvety with soft carbonation. The flavor is spicy-phenolic and sweet… almost to the point of being cloying. As with the finish of many of Dragonmead’s beers, there is no grand finale, per se… just a slow, sweet fade.

It poured a golden yellow color with a white head. Aroma was quite bready, a bit spicy, and mild fruits. It was sort of sweet and was yeasty. It had a great mouthfeel, not thick, but still sort of heavy. I like it overall, but would want to try something a bit stronger perhaps.

Dragonmead Guineveres Golden Belgian Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dragonmead Brewery;Pours a hazy golden color, with a thin cap of white foam. Scant lacing. Yeasty fruity spicy aroma is nice indeed. To me this beer is somewhere between a hefe and a Belgian, but leaning more heavily towards the Belgian.

Dragonmead Guineveres Golden Belgian Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dragonmead Brewery;I rate beers here in spurts. When I have the desire. When I’m not too bored by the other ratings and their super want to be like wine tasters ratings. So here’s the deal: A nice Belgian style from Detroit-Metro’s best.
Dragonmead Breath of the Dragon;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dragonmead Brewery;Pretty ordinary, not bad, just ordinary. Aroma has some kolsch funk with extremely mild uncooked malt. Appearence is clear golden, some minor foam, no lace. Taste is golden malt followed by some bittering. Palate is fizzy, probably the best part. Overall, ordinary, probably its best on a hot day.
Dragonmead Breath of the Dragon;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at brewery. ESB... really? Very mild, very light. Copper color. More of a slightly bitter pils than anything.
Dragonmead Breath of the Dragon;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dragonmead Brewery;"With a powerful name like ""Breath of Dragon,"" the beer has a surprisingly mild flavor. The bitterness is very weak and disappointing."
Dragonmead Breath of the Dragon;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dragonmead Brewery;Draft… RBSG 2010… Clear, brilliant amber ale with a small, creamy, white head. Good retention. Even after several healthy swirls of the glass and much agitation, the aroma remains a near-mystery. I am finally able to pull some biscuit, pale and medium-roast malts from the glass – just too faint to really enjoy. Medium to full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and stinging carbonation. The flavor is bittersweet – honey and toffee sweetness countered by woody and tannic bitterness. Lengthy, bittersweet finish – the bitterness lingers much longer than the sweetness.
Dragonmead Breath of the Dragon;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dragonmead Brewery;Not much of a bitter beer. Certainly not awful (this is one of the worst beers I’ve had at Dragonmead, and it’s still better than many beers I’ve had elsewhere), but definitely not very bitter. Fairly smooth.

Dragonmead Breath of the Dragon;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at the Dragonmead Brew Pub. Poured a medium orange color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of caramel, and some citrus. Tastes of the same caramel and some citrus. Both the aromas and tastes on the non-descript side. At 4%, definitely a session ale but a boring one.
Dragonmead Breath of the Dragon;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dragonmead Brewery;This beer is pretty much my idea of an English bitter beer. It was a light tea color with almost no head. Aroma was weak but nice. Both malt and hop characteristics make for a multi faceted tasting experience.
Dragonmead Breath of the Dragon;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dragonmead Brewery;Solid copper, with an off-white head that sat and stayed. Complex nose of earthy hop, treacle and crackery malt. Classic best bitter here. Everything is so well balanced, and seamlessly integrated. Beautiful beer. Medium in the mouth, with the malt leading the parade. There is some caramel, but it distinctly lacks the caramelly sweetness that plagues so many attempts at this style. Great depth of malt, deftly balanced by hop bitterness. Very well-composed. Low level of carbonation was much appreciated, though this might be even better on cask. Eminently sessionable and enjoyable. On tap at the brewery.
Dragonmead Breath of the Dragon;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dragonmead Brewery;Light orange with creamy lace. No smell detected, and malt taste dominated, despite the style. Caramel and maybe some sugar. One of the weaker ones at the brewpub, and not a good eample of the style,and they keep doing this. Maybe a transition to bitterness.
Dragonmead Corktown Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at PJ’s Lager House in Detroit. Butterscotch and caramel malt aroma. Toasty malt and caramel flavor, still has a bit of butterscotch. Okay, not great.

Dragonmead Corktown Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;Nitro… RBSG 2010… Lightly hazy, dirty orange ale with a small, creamy, off-white head. Fantastic retention… lasts for-almost-ever. The nose is of cookie, tea biscuit, toffee, caramel and all other things sweet and English. Full-bodied with a silky mouthfeel and supple carbonation. The flavor provides sweet toffee, mild caramel and brown sugar with only a pinch of hop bitterness to temper, but not nullify, the sweet malts. Brown sugar, dark syrup finish.
Dragonmead Corktown Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;Had this at Slow’s awhile back. Nice deep red, fairly bitter. Nice beer, though I prefer the Juggernaut now that I’ve tried it. Goes well with BBQ!
Dragonmead Corktown Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at Dragonmead 3-13-09. Murky red color with very little head. Smelled lightly fruity and perfumy. Tasted of molasses, red wine, grassy hops. Light body and long sweet aftertaste.

Dragonmead Corktown Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;Had this on cask, I don't know if that means I should enter it differently, but oh well.

Also got a hint of alcohol near the finish. A long finish as well. Verry easy to drink.

Dragonmead Corktown Red;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;This draft brew from the brewery poured a large sized head of fine to medium sized light brown colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a fair lacing. The body was uncarbonated transparent and copper colored. The aroma was malty and hoppy with the hops dominating the malts. The mouth feel was hoppy from start to finish. The flavor contained biting hops with a very mild malt content. The hops gave me the beer shivers! Now that’s hoppy!

Dragonmead Crusader Dark Mild Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;"An aroma of tobacco and pear. Clear dark brown with a nice white head and minor lace. Tastes mildly sweet like the smell of a good cigar, mild roast malt, and a nearly undetectable grapefruit bitterness on the end to balance the vanilla-ish tobacco sweetness from the start. Palate is nice and creamy; this is only served on nitro. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers from Dragonmead, and the world for that matter; I think it is very under rated and unique beer if you enjoy a mild ale."
Dragonmead Crusader Dark Mild Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;Dark and low alcohol. Palate is incredibly thin. A bit too much sweet maltiness for my tastes.
Dragonmead Crusader Dark Mild Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Dragonmead Brewery;"Draft to taster. Looks good for the style; a semi-transparent dark copper with thin off-white head. Smells malty and chocolatey with a touch of hops. Tastes like it smells with a solid mouthfeel. Not my favorite style, but a solid example of it."
Hennemann Unterleiterbach Spezial-Bier;Zapfendorf-Unterleiterbach, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Brauerei Hennemann Unterleiterbach;"(swing top bottle, purchased at the brewpub) The only brew currently offered at the brew-pub. Clear, dark amber colour with a medium-sized light-beige foamy head. Moderately sweet toast-malty nose, slightly nutty with a whiff of caramel and hops. Sweet-bitter flavour, light to medium bodied, medium carbonation. Toasted malt-character, slightly nutty taste with a touch of caramel; moderately dry, malt-accented toasty finish with faint notes of herbal hops and a short aftertaste with flavours of caramel. Easy to drink and clean but also not very spectacular."
Hennemann Unterleiterbach Spezial-Bier;Zapfendorf-Unterleiterbach, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Brauerei Hennemann Unterleiterbach;Tasted at the brewery. Malty aroma. Very strong barnyard smell. Hopbitter flavor with caramel and coffee, but it is totally overruled by the manure smell that comes out of your glass. Medium bodied and a long bitter finish. I have added some extra point because of the beautiful environment.
Irchenriether Edel Weisse;Irchenrieth, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Johann Hösl;Light banana aroma. Hazy, firm white head, good lace. Light sweet, light malty, light banan, wheat, refreshing, medium body. Nothing wrong but nothing special.
Irchenriether Edel Weisse;Irchenrieth, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Johann Hösl;Aroma and flavor: yeasty, milky, yoghurt. Weizenbeer from a very small farmhouse brewery that has some resemblence to a young lambic. Milky and low on carbon. Not for the average drinker, but I love it!!

Blackstone Maris Otter Pale Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - English;Blackstone Brewing Company;On Tap at Blackstone Restaurant and Brewery in Nashville TN. This brew is a slightly hazy red amber liquid with a small head of white bubbles. Nose is sharp and a bit funky. Taste is classic english pale ale. Malty with some hops and a character that reminds me slightly souring cream. A decent beer. not my favorite style.
Blackstone Maris Otter Pale Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - English;Blackstone Brewing Company;Shared from a 12oz bottle into a nonic glass, thanks Greg. It poured a slightly hazy light amber colour with white foam, lots of lace. Slightly bready and nutty, which are Maris Otter malt’s strengths, but sadly the whole impression was mushy and oxidized. Almost no trace or hops nor yeast. Light-medium body and carbonation, syrupy mouthfeel and aftertaste. Overall impression of a mass-produced amber lager, e.g. Killians, Amber Bock, Shiner Bock, etc. I wonder what went wrong? Based on the brewer’s name and description, I really expected to enjoy this one.
Blackstone Maris Otter Pale Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - English;Blackstone Brewing Company;Sweet maltiness. Nothing terribly memorable. Standard. Not too hoppy. Easy drinking. Thanks Erin.
Blackstone Maris Otter Pale Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - English;Blackstone Brewing Company;I’ve had this brew at both the brewery and in the bottle and though the bottle is just a tease at what truly awaits for you in the draft form I’d just assured have it than none. By far my most favorite beer by BS. The malt/hop ratio balance has no match. There is a slighly sweet taste paired with an underlying hop profile that has no Maris Otter match. However, do not put this in your hydration belt for long runs.
Blackstone Maris Otter Pale Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - English;Blackstone Brewing Company;12 oz bottle pours amber with a off white head. Aroma of sweet malt, resin and spice. Taste is pine resin, sweet malt and a hint of grass. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Blackstone Maris Otter Pale Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - English;Blackstone Brewing Company;12oz bottle, best by 2nd week of June 2013. Served at around 40-45F. Pours clear amber with a one finger white head that leaves a ring and a light sheet of lacing and holds a good foamy cap. Aroma is dough, yeast, grainy, earthy, dirty with some floral hops, some notes of cardboard. Gets better as it warms, but still not great. A little off. Flavor is bready, doughy malt, some caramel, some earthy hops, hint of citrus, somewhat sweet, good bitterness, minimal alcohol, finishes sweet. Gets more and more sweet as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily, with good carbonation. OK. And that may be a stretch. Average at best.
Blackstone Maris Otter Pale Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - English;Blackstone Brewing Company;12 oz. Clear burnt orange with a lasting quarter inch of meringue. Nose is toasted earthy dog biscuit with touches of resin, white grape, eucalyptus, and lemon honey. Taste is the same combination, but thankfully after a few sips the wet dog and grain begins to take a back seat. An increasing resin citrus and yeast presence dries the whole thing well. Quality brew with some complexity for a pale ale, but also a bit bipolar and all over the map from sip to sip. At its best it reminds me a bit of a low-abv tripel. Light-medium body has medium carbonation and is dry. Give this one 4-6 oz. to develop some flavor (at keller temperature of course) and it becomes a good session ale.

Blackstone St. Charles Porter;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Blackstone Brewing Company;Good porter, or maybe a good-enough porter, touching all the bases for the style without really excelling at any of them. Chocolate notes mesh with a nice roasty backbone, slight cherry notes melding with java undertones and a semisweet cocoa finish. Texture is good, and the nose features strong dark roast java and chocolate. Not bad.

Aroma of floating leaf paddies, mint and lemon grass - clean and fragrant. Mildly parching, dry, crisp and bitter on the palate. Light bodied and effervescent. Subtle, dusty malt with a hint of coloured, toasty grains. Short finish; floral, minty and peppered. Sour tang grips the side of the tongue; all in balance. Nothing offensive here. Clean cut and sessionable. Lawnmower to the extreme but tidy enough!! (33cL, no date stamp, Cellarbrations, Lynwood)"
Kingway 12°;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);Bottle from Hongkong: Pale golden color, nearly no head. Flavor is very grainy, corny, cheap. Nearly no hop or bitterness. Poor, very cheap taste and close to water!
Kingway 12°;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);Bottle at some restaurant near New Beer because we couldn’t get a cab. Pours clear old gold with white head. Nose and taste of corn, cardboard, rice, skunk, tortilla malt and old barley. Unpleasant. Light body.
Kingway 12°;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);Clear, slightly brassy gold with a frothy white head. Light grain scent...unbelievably: NO SKUNK ! Taste is a heavy, peppery bread-cardboard affair. Rough, but without the strong sour grain malt found frequently in other Asian Lagers. Not good..but not overly awful.
Kingway 12°;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);Kingway Beer (Premium Lager) has a thin-to-medium, white head and a mostly clear, golden appearance, with some lacing and very fine particulate matter floating about. Some streaming bubbles are present. The aroma is of sweet, lightly toasted barley malt, and the flavor is of sweet, lemony, pale malt, cracker, a touch of paper, and just a kiss of the hops. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Kingway Beer finishes crisp, clean, refreshing, drinkable, mild, and semi-dry. Overall, this is a very good beer, and I think it is certainly worth a try. RJT
Kingway 12°;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);"Bottle at Tokyo Sushi Buffet in Pittsburgh and a guess that I had the ""12"" and not some earlier incarnation. The nice waitress said she would have to check to see if she had a Kingway in stock and seemed surprised to bring one back to the table for my consumption. On the pour there’s an impressive burst of white cloudy foam which was a delight but the rest of the beer failed. I’d venture to say this not only goes poorly with Asian food but that the rest of the culinary world would be similarly disappointed."
Kingway 12°;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);Backlog Shenzen november 2010 Golden color, good foam Light body & complexity Not much flavour Ok with spice food
Kingway 12°;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);Medium white head. Clear deep golden body with carbonation. Light grainy vegetal aroma. Dry-sweet perfumy grainy taste with sugary notes. Mid-bodied. Mild, soft, smooth mouthfeel with some heat. Dryish perfumy sugary aftertaste with floral notes. It’s not bad, but too sweet. I imagine I can taste the alcohol, too. (0.64l bottle, Taste, Hang Hao, Hong Kong.)
Kingway 2008;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);Bottled in Shenzhen, Guangdong. Pale golden, faint head. Light ricey aroma. Dryish with slight paper and glue. Light bodied with surprisingly crisp mouthfeel. While it has a definite adjunct character it remaisn fairly drinkable due to it’s crisp dryness and the shynessof the off-flavours. Don’t drink this if you look for a good beer, drink it if you want a cheap beer to quench your thirst.
Kingway 2008;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);Though generally among the cheapest Kingway beers amongst Pearl River Delta supermarkets, it is surprisingly one of my favorite of the Kingway family. Light color, and very little smell. Not good by any means, but certainly not the worst beer I’ve had in China.
Kingway 2008;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);Bottled, label said 3.6% ABV, 10’. Aroma is grainy with a hint of veggies. Light sweet for a lager, start light bitter but this almost completely disappears. Grainy, cardboard start. Finish is light malty with a hint of citrus. Refreshing but totally unintersting. Technically ok.
Kingway 2008;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);One of the cheaper offerings of the Kingway Brewery. By far not one of the beers that the Kingway Brewery is proud of since in Shenzhen it is the cheapest Kingway beer. The Aroma is downright offending because of the recycled bottle, and the taste does nothing to improve on the other suspect Kingway offerings. Its nothing that needs to be tried.
Kingway 2008;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);Bottle, with one of the cooler labels I’ve seen on a crappy Asian lager, plus it was in - shock - a non-twistoff bottle!! I pretty much agree with Oakes’s rating here (grainy, grassy, hint of starfruit - dude, how the hell did you come up with starfruit? But yeah, it’s there). But he starts out at 0.5 and works his way up, and I’m nicer so my rating is higher.
Kingway 2008;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);Golden with large bubbles. Aroma is mostly gariny, slightly grassy. Flavour is sweet, quite grainy with a hint of starfruit. Not awful as pale lagers go, but certainly uninteresting.
Kingway 2008;Shenzhen, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shenzhen Kingway Brewery (Heineken);"Bottle. I was surprised to find this so far head of when the Olympics come to China. The grocery store in Hong Kong had a sign up that said ""New."" A serious skunk smell that reminded me of Dutch beers. The flavor is also skunky, dry, and carbonated. It was smooth and not bad at all."
ES Beer;Bangkok, Thailand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Boon Rawd;Is beer? Es beer senor. Where else would you expect a beer with tequila in it. Given their penchant for chili in thsi part of the world I guess we could have been given a version of Cave Creek or whatever. Anyway, whatever.
ES Beer;Bangkok, Thailand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Boon Rawd;"Bottle. I had this at the Good View restaurant in Chiang Mai, Thailand. It was listed on the menu under the beer section, and only after my first sip did I realize it was a ""tequilized beer."" It was smooth with a musty aroma and a powerfully sweet flavor."
Hoskins Bitter;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask-Conditioned. Golden colour. Light hoppy aroma. A light, slightly hoppy beer, barely bittered - refreshing however.
Adler Brau Oktoberfest;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;My sample was bottled, purchaed in October from the Woodmans in Madison. Slightly hazy dark orage-brown body, hardly any head. Diesel-oily malts and pumpkin pie in the aroma. The flavor and palate both suck, there’s a biting astringency in the start of the flavor (along with the usual marzen malts) and some dry cardboard to round out the finish. This stuff makes me appreciate the New Glarus Staghorn I recently had even more!
Adler Brau Oktoberfest;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;The best beer I’ve tasted from Adler Brau. Unlike most of their other beers, this has flavor and body with some decent amounts of spices. A little lacking in the hops, IMO.
Adler Brau Oktoberfest;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Fall has to be my favorite time of year for beers. Oktoberfest bears are by far the best seasonal beer there is, and this beer is no exception.
Adler Brau Oktoberfest;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Dark beer, with your typical oktoberfest blend of spices. Not at all bitter, like I'd expected. Another very good beer from this tiny brewery.
Moab Brewery Dead Horse Amber Ale;Moab, Utah, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moab Brewery;On draft at the brewpub in Moab. Pours a clear copper with an off white head. Aroma is nutty and malty. Flavors is mild bitter and moderate sweet. Finishes clean.
Moab Brewery Dead Horse Amber Ale;Moab, Utah, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moab Brewery;From Feb 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! First off, the label says Moab Brewery Belgrade Mt so I'm slightly confused here(contract brewed?) but: It pours from 12oz bottle a cloudy gold with a 2 finger+ head of foam. Better than average head retention. The smell has some earthiness, hops, and some fruit. The taste has an initial malt roastiness to it followed by some citrus hops and then it all seems to fade away. Quickly. Hmm...the finish is *very* watery as is the mouthfeel and I'd have to say that this isn't a very good stab at the style at all. The label says it's in the tradition of an English style Mild but if that's the case..um....nah, I'd give another example of the style a chance. No problem. Bottom line: A very average brew at best and 1 I'd not consider to drink again.

Lancaster Oktoberfest;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Not a great Oktoberfest. Something is not right for me. I would not suggest this beer to a friend
Craftsman Weizenbock;Pasadena, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Craftsman Brewing Company;On draft at Hog’s Apothecary. I’m following brokensail’s lead on this one since this was labeled as dunkelweizen bock and had the same ABV as this beer... It pours an orangy brown color with an off white head. The aroma is very toasted and dry with light cocoa and nuttiness. Maybe some peanut shells with background notes of fruit. The flavor is pleasing with toast, cocoa, nuts and some crisp fruity acidity. It has a great velvety, creamy mouthfeel. Really delish.
Craftsman Weizenbock;Pasadena, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Craftsman Brewing Company;On tap @ Haven Gastropub. I am not 100% certain that this is the same beer, since it hasn’t been rated in 8-9 years, but rather than garbage up the database, I’ll rate it here. Listed as Dunkel Weizenbock. Turbid dark amber pour with a khaki head. Huge clove on the nose with a lot of banana, cola, chocolate, and black pepper. Some orange zest, bread, and cola. A bit of sweet plum and raisin. Flavor is on the sweet side. Plenty of banana, vanilla, cola, and and dark fruits. Notes of orange, toasted bread, and chocolate. Subtle tartness of citrus and plum on the finish.
Craftsman Weizenbock;Pasadena, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Craftsman Brewing Company;On tap at O’Briens San Diego. Cloudy dark with minimal head. Smells like very sweet bananas. Tastes a bit too sweet but fairly nice overall flavor.
Craftsman Weizenbock;Pasadena, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Craftsman Brewing Company;Pours with a muddy, amber-brown body with no head or lacing. The aroma is sweet and yeasty with a slight malt note, a touch of wheat and some candy sugar. The flavor is sweet, slight buttery and slightly yeasty with a touch of malt. Medium bodied and smooth with little carbonation.
Craftsman Weizenbock;Pasadena, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Craftsman Brewing Company;(Draft: 2005 Stone 9th Anniversary Festival in Escondido, CA) Very fruity nose with lots and lots of banana, but I’m also getting a bit of rubbing alcohol which thankfully isn’t the dominant aroma. As with the nose, the prevaling flavor is sweet banana and some bubblegum. The sweetness continues into the finish, but is tempered by both tartness and light bitterness. The tartness I like, it balances the sweetness out, but the bitterness I could do without. Medium-full body, long substantial finish, good carbonation keeps the beer from becoming cloying on the palate. Ruddy brown in color and fully cloudy. The light tan head pours to nearly half an inch, not too shabby for a beer festival. All in all, I’m really enjoying this beer.
Craftsman Weizenbock;Pasadena, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Craftsman Brewing Company;On draft at Stone’s 9th party. This was a murky brown pour. It was slightly sweet. Not bad.
Craftsman Weizenbock;Pasadena, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Craftsman Brewing Company;Draught poured cloudy. Big aroma, very sweet and fruity.. Taste is yeasty with lots of bright fruit (bananas, cherries...) Too sweet for me, but certainly not a boring beer.

Riverside 7th Street Stout;Riverside, California, United States;Stout;Riverside Brewing Company (CA);This beer was dark and color. Can smell coffee and malts. It taste like the malt was burnt. Kind of gross.
Riverside 7th Street Stout;Riverside, California, United States;Stout;Riverside Brewing Company (CA);I always look forward to tasting a new stout. The dark color and great head was calling me toward it. Unfortunately it did not deliver. It had overly burnt roasted malt flavor and too bitter almost chemical aftertaste. There was a great cofee aroma that could not be followed up in taste.

Kirin Maroyaka Kobo;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Bottle. Cloudy and yellow with a nice white head and lively bubbles. The aroma though, is lager-like, with some DMS and rice and sour milk with only a bit of fruitiness and hops. It seems that this one was intended to be a Witbier. Tangy wheat, light citrus and some spiciness dominate. A medium body and spritzy carbonation help with the drinkability powered by a dry finish. Nice try.
Kirin Maroyaka Kobo;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Unfiltered chilled lager. Cloudy yellow-gold color, with a huge fine head. Malty aroma, creamy, round and rich. Fruity with hints of citrus (grapefruit), light on hops but they’re there. Mellow malt flavor, creamy and rounded, fruity with citrus. Medium hops, decent balance. Light and smooth. Creamy finish with malt and yeast, little hops. Fruity. An interesting, smooth and mild beer, yet reasonably rich. Double the hops and you would have a great beer.
Kirin Maroyaka Kobo;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Pours slightly hazy gold, white head. Aroma is sausage and wheat. Flavor is slightly spicy with an aftertaste of corn on the cob, but in a good way.

Kirin Maroyaka Kobo;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);"Hazy golden color with a bit of sediment on the bottom of the bottle, which I was surprised to see. A huge white and foamy head--made me suspect some chemical enhancement (as I always do when encountering generally ""good"" qualities while sampling a macro-made product). Sweet grassy, hoppy aroma, with a tiny bit of malt. Certainly an interesting aroma for a beer of this style. Decent flavors, but nothing too interesting: sweet, grassy, hoppy, and a tiny bit malty. Not bad at all, considering this was produced by a macrobrewery..."
Kirin Maroyaka Kobo;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);This hazy golden beer doesn’t know what it wants to do. It has a yeasty mouth with some cloves and is slightly tart and has a light finish. Usually Kirin’s beers are well made, this is not.
Kirin Maroyaka Kobo;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);"This is a ""keep-chilled"" beer with a 60 day shelf life. This was bottled on 11/9. A hazy yellow brew, like a hefeweizen. Yep mark, loads of sediment. Has almost a skunky scent, herbaceous, grassy, hoppy. A grassy start with a sweet candyish finish. Nice to have a decent brew made by a macrobrewer."
Kirin Maroyaka Kobo;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);"Kirin's brand-new ""premium"" brew. Very cloudy, non-filtered. Stuff floating inside. I had a chunk of something (yeast?) attached to my glass after I was finished. Not very good but I will try it again as my beer was room temp when I drank it."
Achilles Serafijn Tarwe;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrouwerij Achilles;Same bottle as Caesar. Aroma of wheats, malts, spices and fruits. Cloudy, yellow coloured with a thin, white head and dark-brown yeast particles floating arond. Taste is malty, wheaty, spicy and a little fruity. Nice brew
Achilles Serafijn Tarwe;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrouwerij Achilles;Bottle, BB july 2004. Cloudy yellow brownish color, short white head. Aroma is spicy with wheat and some banana. Bit dry, spicy taste, but not too heavy on the stomach. Sweet taste with a bit sticky palate.
Achilles Serafijn Tarwe;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrouwerij Achilles;Muddy blond color. Nice malty aroma, dry and spicy. Dry, spicy, light body, light fudge flavor. Warm and a bit alcoholic. Average palate. Original and quite good.
Achilles Serafijn Tarwe;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrouwerij Achilles;An unclear orange beer. The aroma is spicy with notes of cloves. The flavor is of cloves, wheat malt and rather perfumated. An OK beer.
Achilles Serafijn Tarwe;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrouwerij Achilles;Grain and yeast in the aroma. Yellow body, white head. Sour flavor, some honey and sugar. A bit sweet finish. Rather synthetic and perfumed.

Yeast, orange and slight honey aroam and flavor. Good lacing. Not too bad, but maybe a bit disappointing. The yeastiness dominates in the aftertaste.
Achilles Serafijn Tarwe;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrouwerij Achilles;Very blond, slightly cloudy beer with a small white head. Fruit candy aroma. Slightly bitter somewhat spicy taste. This is a little different from other Belgian Whites but I really like it. The only drawback could be the sweet undertone.
Achilles Serafijn Tarwe;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrouwerij Achilles;Sampled draught at Akkurat, Stockholm, Sweden. Yellow and really hazy with creamy head. Deep fruity, estery winegum aroma. Sweet and malty with just a hint of wheat flavour, and no trace of the traditional witbier spices. Instead it is well hopped with notes of butterscotch and a grassy finish. A complex, well balanced and slighly unusual beer.
Achilles Serafijn Tarwe;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrouwerij Achilles;"At 6.2 this is a try to do it a little different. Especially the taste is, indeed; different: an immediate impression of hopbitter, not too much spiciness, but a dissapointing sweetish aftertaste of cornflake or maize. Another Belgian wheat, after all."
Santa Barbara Crispy Cream Ale;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Cream Ale;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Bright yellow in color with loose head. Stong fizz in the mouth that hides some of the delicate malt and a smattering of perfumed hops. Nice cookie/ floral finish.

Santa Barbara Whitecap Wit;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;GABF 2003: Nose of old and wet hay and grass. No touch of coriander, which I expect in a witbier. Missing punch, citrus, and wheat flavors. Light and weak.

Santa Barbara Whitecap Wit;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Light gold color. Small head. Aroma is citrus and orange. A light bodied Belgian wit. Malts are fruity and spicy. Hops are a touch spicy. Fine carbonation. Nice balance. Light and refreshing. A great beer for a warm summer evening. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Santa Barbara Whitecap Wit;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Honey suckle with a little citrus rind in the nose.Yeasty gauzey mouthfeel, simple but solid flavors of perfume, dust and oak. Seemed a bit tame when up next to Hogarten.

Santa Barbara Sinister Saison;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Sample on tap at SBBC, during graduation trip 5/05. Came to me looking a cloudy yellow/white color. The aroma was much like a wheat beer with some Belgian hints, spicy and think banana fruit. The flavor was semi-sweet with a bit of wheat and hard to place aromas (after reading the description I’d have to guess spice). I would never have guessed that there was lavender and sage in there. The body was adequate. I found this interesting but would have needed a whole glass to make a really solid analysis. This was different.
Santa Barbara Sinister Saison;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Tap at brewpub. Golden whitish yellow color, a bit darker than a wit, cloudy, almost no head and very little lacing. Aroma is mild, gentle spices (most notably ginger, and from the description it seems I got that right), a bit citrusy. Flavor is mostly sweet, kind of a toasty malt flavor, pepper really stands out of the spiciness but it doesn’t really dominate. The interplay between the sweet and spicy flavors was the real highlight here, after taking a sip it seemed like it was a constant tug of war that you were sure would have a winner, but in the end you aren’t sure who was ahead (and you are dying to take another mouthful to try and resolve this). Finish is fairly dry. Mouthfeel is light, well carbonated, and perfect for a warm spring evening, extremely drinkable. Overall, an enjoyable brew.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately hoppy (lemon), with notes of banana, clove, grape, rosemary, anise, etc. Flavor is heavily sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Kinda similar in aroma to Bosteels' Deus, and about as enjoyable too. Not quite what I'd call a saison, as it's too sweet and rich/heavy, but it's a delicious Belgian strong ale nonetheless.
Santa Barbara Sinister Saison;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;This beer was sampled at the San Diego Strong Ale Festival. This saison, which came highly recommended by the cat (DaSilky1), poured a yellowy golden hue with a white foamy head which absolutely engulfed the entire glass and took a good four minutes to dissipate enough to drink. The aroma was total barnyardiness at its finest. Banana and orange dominate with hints of multiple other spices and fruits. The taste is all barnyard... some leathery orange and banana flavors...BIG heavy sour ending. Very dry and extremely carbonated finish. Some ginger in the finish..you can definitely tell there. Absolutely worth trying again!

Some candied orange peel, bread, toffee, and a little bit of caramel. The hop character is minimal, mostly grass and a bit of floral aroma. Kind of a garbage smell to it, too.

Santa Barbara Pacific Pale Ale;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Poured from a draft into a pint glass at Santa Barbara Brewing Company in Santa Barbara, Calif. Color was hazy orange. Maybe an inch of head. Decent amount of film on the top. Lots of film on the sides throughout the pour. Smelled of caramel pale malts.

Couleur brune foncé tirant vers l’acajou, apparence presque opaque. Énorme formation de mousse beige, crémeuse et persistante. Arômes de métal, de raisins et de porto sous des tonnes de malt chocolaté. Construite sur le malt, saveurs prononcées de fudge, de cacao et d’épices. Une touche de madérisation et d’oxydation fonctionne bien avec le reste des saveurs. Carbonatation extrêmement douce, sensation douce en bouche, corps d’épaisseur moyenne.

Campbells Christmas Ale;Leuven, Belgium;Strong Ale - English;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);No#14. (1980 something not sure what year) . Intresting little number here. Aged sweetish aroma with nuttyness kickin about. Taste is similar without the nuttyness, not as complex as expected, maybe a little too aged?
Campbells Christmas Ale;Leuven, Belgium;Strong Ale - English;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Pretty aged sample Scotch yes - Belgian that too - English - no way! Thin yellow-brown head, gone in secs on quite carbonated, dark-brown beer, hazy. Grapey, raisins-like nose, rich, dark malts (not bitter or burnt), sweet-portlike or Maideira aromas. Nutty (walnut), and port flavour. Given the fact that it HAS some blue cheesy notes (albeit faint), this is an after-dinner party in a (small) bottle. Caramel & cakes taste. Despite a rich nose, and a heavy onset, the end is pretty thin. The alcohol is very hidden. Nice one. The aging has bettered it, but for one thing: the original thin MF has been accentuated if anything. Yet, one to try if you find it.
Campbells Christmas Ale;Leuven, Belgium;Strong Ale - English;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);(Bottle 25 cl) Belgium has this strange tradition for Scotch Ale of which this is a typical example.

Amarit Lager;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Thailand;Bottle. Clear and crisp. Characterless lager. Good with Thai food? I guess so....
Amarit Lager;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Thailand;330. Quite possibly the skunkiest beer in the known universe. Pours fizzy crystal clear ultralight yellow. Thin fizzy white head that falls away to nothing. Aroma? Lift that black and white striped tail and shake that booty, you’ll get it. Blecch. Kills your enthusiasm for the beer instantly, before it’s even in the glass. Super-watery body, carb runs away, syrupy sweet corn badness. Not much flavor otherwise, and a clingy, chemicaly finish. This is one beer best served with the cap still on. Phooey.
Amarit Lager;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Thailand;"Part of an 8-pack of ""International Beer Selections"". The whole 8-pack was a bit of a dud, and this was just one of the average, watery pale lager style beers. Given that the only other rating for this beer is from 4 years ago, I wonder if my sample is from that era. Anyway, this was a bit better than the last few I have rated in that it had a fresher aroma, and a drier finish, making a more palatable (although still pretty average) pale lager."
Amarit Lager;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Thailand;"Can. I found this in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I was surprised that I never found this in Thailand despite 16 days of travel there. The can was printed with a label that says ""For Export Only,"" so maybe they gave up selling it within Thailand. I did see a sign in a bar for the Amarit NB, but they no longer carried it. This beer was a grand prize winner at the Brewex 1972 World Beer Competition in London. The aroma had hops and citrus. It was pretty good for a beer of this type."
Gold Lion Lager Beer;Jakarta, Indonesia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;PT Delta (San Miguel);Can. The can said it was brewed for the Singapore Brewing Co. by P.T. Delta DJakarta. I found it in Malaysia. As far as I can tell the Singapore Brewing Co. no longer produces anything, and I could not find this in Singapore. Gold Lion Lager had some hops in the aroma. It was fairly smooth and easy to drink but obviously did not have much flavor.
Gold Lion Extra Stout;Jakarta, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;PT Delta (San Miguel);Judging by the reviews I’d think everyone was drinking something different than what I had. This was a delicious stout. Very rich and chocolately. Also flavors of coffee and teryaki sauce. No hop presence of any kind. Bitterness is extremely minimal.
Gold Lion Extra Stout;Jakarta, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;PT Delta (San Miguel);Can. I found this in Malaysia. A deep dark brown with a small head. A whisky aroma or a sweet liqueur which indicated a high abv. The liqueur aroma carries in the flavor. Bitter and roasted. An odd stout in my book.
Gold Jaguar Stout;Jakarta, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;PT Delta (San Miguel);"Can Dark color; brown, thick, creamy head. Aroma of coffee beans, molasses, cardboard; smells like an expired one. Coffee, liquorice, molasses, but badly mixed together, too bitter final, and I’m quite disgusted."
Gold Jaguar Stout;Jakarta, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;PT Delta (San Miguel);Can. Solid black with a rich full brown head. The aroma is tart with red vinous fruits lacing the aroma.

Panther Stout (8%, red);Tambun-Bekasi, West Java, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Bali Hai Brewery Indonesia;Had this from a can in Singapore a month ago, and I just dug out my crinkled up rating of it. Tinny alcohol is all I smelled before letting the fizzy brown head effervesce away, then there is earthy coffee and caramel. Syrupy mouthfeel (alcohol) with flavours of coffee, chocolate-caramel, and ash. The alcohol is really harsh in the finish, and overall this comes off as poorly integrated and difficult to finish. On the other hand, getting to drink it while sitting in the National Botanic Gardens of Singapore really helps!

Lompoc India Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Lompoc Brewing;On tap this brew pours a medium amber with a white head that lasts for a while. This could have been a really nice IPA, but there was a lot of diacetyl that made it overly sweet and buttery. Citrus hops in the nose and in the finish. The bitterness balanced out a lot of the sweetness, but way too much butterscotch taste from the diacetyl ended up getting to me by the end of the pint. I’ll have to try this at the Lompoc to see if i can get a better sample.

Lompoc C-Note;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Lompoc Brewing;Bottle from Mitsuya Liquors. Pours a deep copper with a finger of head.

Stone Cat Scotch Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ipswich Ale Brewery;The best stone cat i’ve had. An ale that tastes a little sweeter than a normal ale, would never have guessed the 7.5%abv. Not bad, not great, a slightly above average beer.
Stone Cat Scotch Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle, from Colonial spirits. OK nose, malty. Dried fruits (prune/raisin), licorice, caramel, peat, clean reddish brown color, nice head that quickly went down to a ring. Malty sweet flavors. Bigger than aromas.Caramel, licorice dominate, little coffee. Little hot. Alot like aroma, though Thick body, oily creamy mouthfeel, sweet dry finish. Nice brew, got better as it warmed.
Stone Cat Scotch Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Brown pour, beige head. Nice and malty, though not as malty as I like my scotch ales. Needed to age in bottle a little longer, methinks, it seemed to lack in complexity and layering of flavour I would like. Otherwise, it was good enough, and I would try it again.
Stone Cat Scotch Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pours a hazy brown with a tan head that quickly dissipates. Smells of sweet caramel malt. Some hints of fruitiness. Taste is all malt. Lots of caramal malt. A bit one dimensional. Very light carbonation. Candy corn flavors? Kind of a sticky mouthfeel. Not a bad scotch ale but not very good either. Something is missing, maybe a smokiness that I would expect in a scotch ale. Probably won’t get again.
Stone Cat Scotch Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Spring 2004 bottle. Wow!!! What a beer. Very excited to rate this one. On the pour, my biggest complaint is the obvious filtration. Mostly clear ruby-mahogany, with some darker black/browns. Good dark cream colored head that sticks atop the beer. The aroma is quite peculiar. While not overly aromatic (the aroma dosent jump in your face), when you do take the time to sniff close to this stuff, it is about as complex and wonderful as a scotch ale has smelled to me. Dark black anise, molasses, light malted peat, rich but dry caramel, some other spices that I can’t name in there as well. Flavor however, goes a step farther with complexity. The black licorice is quite obvious and in the background a deep rich malt develops. At first I thought I detected smoked peat, but I never could find this flavor again, so I’m not sure. Spicy, rich, dark and wonderful. The malt is neither too sweet nor too dry. Intensely engaging on the palate. It has that anaesthetic property that you feel when you are drinking jagermeister. At the end of the glass, my tongue was slightly numbed. Some hazlenut in there as well, but very subtle. Flavor never thins, the body is medium to medium full and there is a moderate carbonation. This was a true gem and I’m glad I found this single bottle, because there were no more six packs of this to be found in the area. Highly recommended (take your time drinking this one). Drank this one only slightly chilled.
Stone Cat Barley Wine;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ipswich Ale Brewery;2003 Bottle shared by hopscotch on 12/27/07: Pours a transparent copper brown with a thin, spotty-lacing off-white head. Aroma of sweet caramel, brown sugar and raisins with a touch of black cherries. Body starts fairly rich and sweet with good caramel maltiness and raisin flavor toward a drier, mildly oxidized and warming finish. Seems to have aged pretty well and has good complexity.
Stone Cat Barley Wine;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Thanks to hopscotch for sharing this beer. Pours dark brown to black, no head. Aroma is malty, mild to my nose, could have been a bit more pronounced for my tastes. Great flavor, sweet raisins and brown sugar with a dry alcohol aftertaste.
Stone Cat Barley Wine;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle (2003) ... O-Town Christmas Gathering ’07... This beer rocks!... Very dark, cloudy ale with almost no head... still dark even when help up to bright light. The aroma is of candy sugar, coffee, burnt caramel and dark fruits. Full-bodied and velvety with soft carbonation. Sweet and malty. Mega-rich. Tastes a bit like a Starbucks® caramel latte. Lengthy, mocha-sweet finish. Thanks to TheBeerCellar for providing this beer for me to share!
Stone Cat Barley Wine;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Thanx to Hopscotch for sharing this.pours a cola color with virtually no head.The nose on this was sweet like caramel.The flavor was caramel and dark fruits.The finish was warming.
Stone Cat Barley Wine;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Courtesy hopscotch. Dark chestnut color, deadish pour. Some alcohol on the nose, strong spiced caramel also. Dark rich taste with some mellowed-out heat. Mostly a malt show, with little hop backing. Pretty dead on the palate. The palate takes a bit from the taste.
Stone Cat Barley Wine;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Courtesy hopscotch. Pours a dark brown with a very light, bubbly brown head. Smells very sweet and fruity up front, alot of malt, some caramel, with a mild alcohol tone to round it out. The flavor is much of the same. Malty caramel and dark fruits seem to blend together well, and the alcohol seemed more subdued in the flavor which surprised me. Fairly smooth and easy to drink, with a good dose of bitterness in the aftertaste.
Stone Cat Barley Wine;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12 oz bottle. Dark brown with frothy tan edges. Aromas of berries and caramel. Smoky toffee and mild hops. Medium body, light carb. Black coffee finish. Neat stuff. Need to try again when my palate is not so shot.
Stone Cat Barley Wine;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12’er, cellared for one year. Dark ruby color. Small head. Lovely nose. Great taste. A great BW!
Stone Cat Barley Wine;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Awesome. A deep brown pour with burned red and purple highlighted edging. Very thin (notions of a)head, light brown and persistent. Aroma is chocolate and caramel malt, a velvety rendition of this combo. Light rasperry and alcohol notes mingle with the sinewy malts. All this blends to create a pleasant truffle sensation. The flavor is very bitter chocolate, creamed berries(mostly raspberry and blackberry). The alcohol that sends forcible warming down the throat is like hot tar, and is a rather fun addition to the whole experience. Finishes semi-dry with a touch of sweet caramel candy. Incredibly oily and slick on the palate. A mouthfeel this full almost four years after bottling is really a treat. Very, very impressive. No signs of real oxidation, more like hints it is in there somewhere. One of the most gracefully aged barleywines I’ve had the pleasure of sampling.
Stone Cat Barley Wine;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Courtesy boboski. 2003. Black/brown with brown edges and a small tan cap. Aroma of roasty toffee, dark fruits (raisins, figs, raspberries), subtle licorice, aged malt, old wood, light oxidation, stale cookies. Same flavors with marshmallow like sweetness, more roastiness (especiallyin the finish), caramel. Rich. Old Ale like. Full body, smooth, viscous, just enough gas to give it life. Excellent.
Stone Cat Octoberfest;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pours deep amber into a shaker. White head quickly recedes to hug rim. Sour caramel aromas. Crisp and sweet upfront with a sour lasting grain finish.
Stone Cat Octoberfest;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Tap. The only tolerable beer of the day. A fest at Ipswich is not a good day. All the beers are terrible and the musles and clams have sand in them.
Stone Cat Octoberfest;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pours a medium brown with a quarter-inch white head. Hoppy and sweet, with a banana/fruit taste. Good autumn beer.
Stone Cat Octoberfest;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Ipswich Ale Brewery;2004 bottle. Pours a dark orange with some light auburn highlights and hints of brown. Small beige head, filtered body. Aroma of fruity hops (candied apples, strawberries, plums) some light caramel malt and yeast. Flavor starts out intensely fruity, especially for a marzen. Grain notes through the middle with bitter hops on the finish and an almost syrupy shot of caramel or sweet toffee. The finish has a fruity bouquet reminiscent of ale yeast, but there is a hint of spicy lager yeast lingering around. Reminds me much of Weyerbacher Autumnfes, not very true to a traditional German marzen, but much hoppier and fruitier. Would like much more dry malt. Body is medium.
Stone Cat Octoberfest;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Ipswich Ale Brewery;I have the Dornbusch octoberfest which is brewed by Mercury brewing. So I can only assume that since this beer called Ipswich Octoberfest that has no ratings is the beer I have. Anyway, It had a malty taste which it was dominated by, and a pretty thick palate for an octoberfest. This is not something I would get again.
Stone Cat Winter Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Ipswich Ale Brewery;A very tasty dark malty lager. Rich and roasty aromas and flavors. Got in the mix pack. Not overly sweet and very enjoyable. Full, firm body. Tasty finish.
Stone Cat Winter Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Sweet chocolatiness greets the nose as you bring a pint of Stone Cat Winter Lager to your lips. This beer is dark brown with a quickly disappearing head. The consistency is thick and syrapy - nearly like a stout. Not much carbonation. Caramel, toffee, and brown sugar flavors grace the tongue. A great dark lager.
Stone Cat Winter Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12oz bottle poured into glass. Kinda middle of the road. Really kinda light and flavorless for a winter lager. Dont taste any spices or flavors other than the malted barley. Thin.
Stone Cat Winter Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Very nice pour - dark with a chocolate brown head. Toasty. Charcoaly and burnt toast taste to it - which overwhelms the beer. If it perhaps had a smoother texture or some other taste blended in, then perhaps I would appreciate the taste more.
Stone Cat Winter Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Dark color, deep brown/near black. Small, toasted, creamy head. Aroma of deep coffee and espresso notes, nice roastiness that follows on the palate. Medium body. Warm greeting of hops on the tongue, and a full ballast of smooth malt. Bit of an awkward finish, with an odd metallic tinge. Carbonation seems high, too. A passable ale, but among the lesser ranks of winter brews. Actually, the site calls it a schwarzbier, and the label says it’s a winter ale. Which is it?
Stone Cat Winter Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Deep ruby body, small creamy tan head. Sweet doughy aroma, some smokiness. Flavor is malty but thin. Mostly sweet with a lingering light bitterness.
Stone Cat Winter Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Dark dark chestnut brown. Very small off white head, rapidly disippating. Has a slight aroma of molasses and brown bread and some caramel malt. Opens up moderately sweet, brown sugar and honey. Body is quite thin, but as it warms the finish is wonderfully flavorful. Slight roast, touch of hops bitterness. Normally I wouldnt rate a beer this light too highly, but it has such a great flavor. Much better, thankfully, than Ipswich winter ale.
Stone Cat Winter Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Deep brown liquor. Roasty nose. Pleasantly sweet first, light to medium bodied, steady carbonation, roasted malts, finishing lightly hopped and very drinkable. A decent Schwarzbier from Massachusetts.
Stone Cat Winter Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pretty nice stuff. Very dark in color. Has a nice roasty maltiness, with a bit of pale malt flavor as well. The initial taste is an almost bock-like sweetness, tapering out to roasted malt and a touch of hops. A very nice beer, much better than I was expecting.
Stone Cat Hefeweizen;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Hazy straw pour. Citrus and spice aroma. Not much bitter, some sweet, a little sour. Spice and citrus flavors, but not much.
Stone Cat Hefeweizen;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ipswich Ale Brewery;From Matt at 3R6P. Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a cloudy yellow color with a huge foamy yellow-white head that lingered and left some lacing. The aroma was clove. lemon, bubblegum and an unfortunate sulfuric undertone. The flavor was dry and tart with notes of chalk, cardboard and lemon with a strong medicinal and sulfuric presence that overwhelmed. The finish was unfortunately long. Medium body. Unpleasant.
Stone Cat Hefeweizen;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Straight up and down with this one. Bananas and clove with a little funk on top. Traditional hefe haze. I got a slight sour lemon taste to it. Nothing over or underwhelming here.
Stone Cat Hefeweizen;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Stone Cat is a hazy golden yellow. Its mellow citrus and banana aroma reflects the taste. It is light-bodied with both a light sweet and sour taste. Just a standard hefeweizen for when you want one.
Stone Cat Hefeweizen;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pours a chill-hazed gold into a weizen. White head quickly recedes to hug rim. Gym clothes and clove aromas. Crisp, dry and thin with mild banana from front to back. MIld lemon in the finish.
Stone Cat Hefeweizen;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12oz bottle-pours a white ring for a head and hazy yellow/gold color. Aroma is clove, lemon, sweet light malt/wheat, occasionally some wood/smoke. Taste is plenty of clove/pepper, lemon, sweet light malt/wheat, some spice hops.
Stone Cat Hefeweizen;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle. Pours a cloudy, golden yellow. Nice, but quickly disappearing white head. Yeast around the inside of the bottle opening. Nose is citric with some banana in the background. The overwhelminging flavor was lemon which kept those sweet banana esters from escaping even though they did rattle the jailhouse doors. This got better as it warmed but those typical hefeweizen flavors were not completely released. Some spice. This beer has potential but requires more body and balance.
Stone Cat Hefeweizen;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ipswich Ale Brewery;On tap @ the Eaglebrook Saloon rebadged under as EagleBrook Hefeweizen. Great nose, classic banana & clove with a sweet corny, bubblegummy thing. Cloudy golden orange color, No head or lacing. Sweet spicy flavor, banana, clove mainly, but has some citusy bite to it. Lemon/lime kind of. Lite body, creamy mouthfeel, spicy dry finish. Easy to drink Hefe. Again way too cold, but hey what can you do. Assuming the rebadge as the bartender, who said he is the owners brother, wasn’t sure about that fact.
Stone Cat Hefeweizen;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ipswich Ale Brewery;2004 bottle. Very hazy straw yellow mixed with some darker golds. Bottle conditioned. Small white head, rapidly disippating. Quite fizzy. Smells lightly sweet (corn, bubble gum, clove). Flavor is sweet, but not overbearingly so. There is a spritzy carbonation to this, that adds a pleasing texture, and while the body may be a bit underdeveloped, the clove and bubble gum taste real enough to keep this one afloat. Ends quickly and cleanly. A pretty good beer all around, great as a session hefeweizen and perhaps a deeper flavor than some of the above-average examples. I see where they’re going with the summer session thing, but I really would like this beer more with a bigger body and perhaps a hint more balancing hops.
Stone Cat Hefeweizen;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pours with a one-finger bubbly white head that fades to a ring leaving some lace. Ton of yeast left in bottle. Cloudy amber color. Light bodied. Nose is yeasty. Light carbonation. Starts sweet, yeast is right there in your face mixed with some hops. Good on a hot day (92) like today. $1.80 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma.
Abbaye de Crespin Secret Des Moines;Arques, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);Poured a clear golden with a huge white head. Floral aroma of hops. Medium body, flavour is grassy and hoppy with a bitter aftertaste.

Abbaye de Crespin Secret Des Moines;Arques, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);"750ml corked bottle from Aldi, Tavira, Algarve. Deep orange gold with a high uneven white head tufting the glass. Sweet yeasty aroma boasting hay, coriander, sherbet lemon, slight barnyard,custard and nutmeg spiciness, some boiled vegetal notes. Soft and sherbety with discreet tangerine and green dusty spice; parsley, maybe orange peel. Silky and flavoured, difficult to pin down, faintly oozing quality and compared to my last 37 beers, SOUL. Quality."
Abbaye de Crespin Secret Des Moines;Arques, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);Bottle. Golden body with a medium off white head. Fruit, malt, caramel and light hops in aroma. Flavour is quite yeasty with notes of fruit and light hops. Medium bodied.
Abbaye de Crespin Secret Des Moines;Arques, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);Bottled(750ml). -Who would’ve tell that I would be second to rate this beer, and first after almost six years. Will it be as bad as SilkTork wrote or has it become better through the years? Well, Nothing special here but it deserves more than 1.7. Sweet malty, mild wheaty and weak spicy with notes of rice and touch of alcohol in the sweet finish. 6.6%ABV.
Abbaye de Crespin Secret Des Moines;Arques, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);A medium quality, characterless, boring, dull, lifeless, nondescript......yawn.
Glen Ellyn G.E. Red;Glen Ellyn, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Glen Ellyn Sports Brew;"Draught [sampled as ""Lady Red Ale""]: Fiery red-orange colour, aroma offers a light spun cotton candy, aromatic hops and a distinctive English malt. . .Good hoppy flavour that combines with the malts well, and evenly. Flavour include pine, dry biscuit dough, and bitter honey. A slightly different bitterness that I am used to, offering something unique and tasty."
Glen Ellyn Prospect Park Pale Ale;Glen Ellyn, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Glen Ellyn Sports Brew;Aroma was not very strong but typical cascade aroma. Light golden color. The taste was very bitter for an APA, I would classify this as an IPA. The flavor is missing a hoppy character.
Glen Ellyn Milky Way Stout;Glen Ellyn, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Glen Ellyn Sports Brew;Light brown head that diminishes quickly. Black with a very nutty aroma, with lots of malt. Lightly roasted and extra clean on the palate. Finish has hints of chocolate and bits of carmel. An easy drinking stout.
Glen Ellyn Milky Way Stout;Glen Ellyn, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Glen Ellyn Sports Brew;This one appears black, but closer inspection reveals that it is really a deep, dark garnet color with no head. Very light body. Easy to drink with subtle hints of roasted malts and coffee. Flavors are marginally more accessible as it warms, but still not outstanding.
Black Rock Abbey-Style Double;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Black Rock Brewing Company;called Father Wimmer's or something like that (allegedly a brewer from a pre-prohibition American Trappist brewery). Needs some aging, some more hops, and a broader malt profile
Black Rock Abbey-Style Double;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Black Rock Brewing Company;Unimpressive abbey ale. Just a slight sweet flavor. Nice dark color, not much head or aroma. This brewery needs to kick it up a notch with all their beers.
Ohio Brewing Buckeye Brown;Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Ohio Brewing Company;Pours a dark brownish red color with a medium tan head. Aroma is malty and almost that of rotten fruit. The bottle we had was really old so I think it may have gone bad.
Ohio Brewing Buckeye Brown;Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Ohio Brewing Company;Bottled in 2001: I took one sip and spit it back into the glass. Tart, sour, vomitous flavor. Undrinkable. Sorry Dogbrick, but this is past its time. I mourn the passing of what was at one time probably a decent beer.
Ohio Brewing Buckeye Brown;Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Ohio Brewing Company;Dark amber color with a small creamy beige head. Aroma of nuts spices and berries. This is an old bottle from Dogbricks find, and it doesn't taste like a brown ale anymore, it has a sour fruity flavor. Almost like Flemish sour ale. I liked it.
Ohio Brewing Buckeye Brown;Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Ohio Brewing Company;Found at the Wine Vault in Dublin, OH. This brewer is out of business so my sample is a little old. Pours a really pretty dark brownish red color with a medium and lasting beige head. Aroma of roasted malt and fruit. Unfortunately the flavor suffered from age. The malt flavor was overpowered by a sour taste and I could not finish it. This was probably a lot better fresh.
Ohio Brewing Buckeye Brown;Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Ohio Brewing Company;Dark brown color. A medium bodied brown ale. Roasted malts, chocolaty. Fairly hoppy for a brown ale. Good flavor, smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Deep Creek Holy Cow India Pale Ale;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deep Creek Brewing Company;440ml can from First Choice Liquor. It's a decent enough US-style IPA with prominent resinous and citrusy hops on the nose and tongue. Lean malt bill. Medium body and carbonation. Clear golden appearance, medium-sized white head.
Deep Creek Holy Cow India Pale Ale;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deep Creek Brewing Company;Crystal clear, golden ale with a huge, frothy, white head. Very cool cumulus and stratus lacework. Citrusy, piney aroma. More-than-moderately bitter flavor. Tastes like pink grapefruit rind. Medium-bodied with an astringent mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Lengthy, bitter finish. The bitterness borders on being unpleasant. No character... just carelessly hopped. Still, a must try for hopheads who really like the bite of the Galena.
Deep Creek Holy Cow India Pale Ale;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deep Creek Brewing Company;Hoppy sweet and floral aromas. Lighter gold color, good lacing. Sweet and fruity malts mixed with an almost assertive pine hop. Very smooth body with a nice crisp finish. Could drink a few of these without being overwhelmed. (Tasted at the PA Microbrewer Fest)
Deep Creek Holy Cow India Pale Ale;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deep Creek Brewing Company;Pale goldish wheat in color with a small head.

Smell lots of orange, hints of malts, caramel, resin, yeast,  oatmeal/semolina, meat. Taste fruit, peach, orange, mango, yeast, hops, medium bitter and medium sweet, sticky grainy and herby.

Anchor Ice Beer;Petaling Jaya, Malaysia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Malaysia Berhad;Bottle brought back for me by Ryan from his holiday. Listed from historic notes. Pale golden coloured lager, with a small slightly off white head. Slight aroma of corn, thin texture, average carbonation.
Anchor Ice Beer;Petaling Jaya, Malaysia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Malaysia Berhad;330 ml can, rating from old notes based on a can bought in Bali. Golden body with a descent but short valid white head. Weak aroma of straw and apple. Flavor like a typical low budget industrial pilsner, i.e. corn and malt with a fizzy, watery body. Actually a bit more bitterness than expected. Acceptable thirst-quencher in the heat, but noting more.
Anchor Ice Beer;Petaling Jaya, Malaysia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Malaysia Berhad;(04.04.06) 330 mL green bottle consumed at the Rose Garden of Shamian Island, Guangzhou, China. Poured clear straw colored with large short lived white head. Frizzy carbonation. Sweetish skunk aroma. Light malt sweetness and corn flavor. Finished dry with light malt fade. Light bodied. Drinkable but still tasted like a generic Chinese lager. Nothing particularly memorable about this beer except that the beer was unusually frizzy (artificial carbonation?).
Anchor Ice Beer;Petaling Jaya, Malaysia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Malaysia Berhad;"Bottle, Kuala Lumpur Golden color; poor head. Poor aroma and flavor, a bit oily. Not bitter enough. Halfway to a Strong Lager."
Anchor Ice Beer;Petaling Jaya, Malaysia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Malaysia Berhad;Bottled, China Town, Kaula Lumpur. Served in a hideous clear bottle, looking all the world piss, the beer doesn’t taste nearly as bad. Achieving a smooth smokey taste that whilst initially pleasing on the upside, is actually short lived. Rated in the back of a Malay taxi on the way back to the hotel the beer performed the job required of it.
Anchor Ice Beer;Petaling Jaya, Malaysia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Malaysia Berhad;Draft: Medium body with golden color. Slightly bitter but goes down well. No head.
Anchor Ice Beer;Petaling Jaya, Malaysia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Malaysia Berhad;Extra alcohol doesn't translate into extra taste necessarily. The climate demands something like this however and so it is enjoyable for that reason.
Anchor Ice Beer;Petaling Jaya, Malaysia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Malaysia Berhad;Anchor ice is one nice beer I used to drink when I lived in Malaysia.The high kick is a reason people like it.Smooth to drink,especially when it's kept ice-cool.
Anchor Ice Beer;Petaling Jaya, Malaysia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Malaysia Berhad;Can. Anchor Pils is all over Singapore, but I never saw the Ice version until I got to Malaysia. Given the availability of other high abv beers in Malaysia, it seems like they prefer more kick to their beer. I thought Anchor Ice had more aroma and flavor but the high alcohol hurt it overall. It had a nice white head on the pour.
Deep Creek Chomplys Porter;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Porter;Deep Creek Brewing Company;A slightly flavorful porter. Light bodied, some burnt chocolate flavor. Drinkable yet not outstanding.
Red Star Oak Aged Abbey Brown Ale;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Red Star Agave Grille;Smelled great, looked good. Taste fell short, not very carbonated, almost like a Flanders Red Ale, yet this had a very weak short lived sweet flavor. Had better.
McNeill's Tartan Export Ale;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;McNeill's Brewery;Poured into an English pint glass, the appearance was a semi-burnt orange to red to brown color with a thin layer of white foaminess. Quickly dissipates. No lacing. The aroma centers around caramel, toffee and nutty malts. Grassy and earthy hops. Sly peat, with a crisp English black tea to it. The flavor was a decent earthy bitter to sweet profile. Some soft black tea. Black tea and caramel in the aftertaste. Sly crisp finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation seems to hit decently but low, it’s good for the style. Overall, decent for the style and trying to build it together, but the blend isn’t quite there yet.
McNeill's Tartan Export Ale;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;McNeill's Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Pours hazy amber with a thin head. Sweet malts, toffee, and faint apple like fruity notes. Ehhh not that good.

McNeill's Tartan Export Ale;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;McNeill's Brewery;This had a slight sweet/tartness that isn’t usual yet I loved. Deep and malty. Easy to drink. Really a great brew.
McNeill's Tartan Export Ale;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;McNeill's Brewery;Poured from 22oz bottle. Pours a rich mahogany (like Ron Burgany’s office) with a fair amount of off-white head. Aroma is tons of smoked peat. Taste is slightly sweet with some smoke and hints of dried figs. A decent beer in this style, but far from the best I have had.
McNeill's Tartan Export Ale;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;McNeill's Brewery;The label has a funny drawing of a pair tough highlanders on it. Surprisingly fruity aroma, with some yeast too. It is sweet and malty all right, like a good SA should be. The noticeably fruity flavor conjures up thoughts of sweet cider and even sweet wine. There are some nice complexities around the edges too. Good.

McNeill's Tartan Export Ale;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;McNeill's Brewery;Bomber. Poured medium amber with a short off-white head. The aroma picked up artificially-sweetened caramel and fruity notes with a definite sour kicker.. a touch smoky. The flavor was strong with sourness and apparent infection.. fruity and caramel sweetness at the core were overrun by the sours.. a pinch of smoked peat on the edges.. tacky sour fruits and residual sugars on the finish. Grainy and sour on the palate with lots of carbonation.. not good.
McNeill's Tartan Export Ale;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;McNeill's Brewery;Bottle. Dirty copper amber with thin head. Rich scent of caramel, toffee, bit of chocolate. First taste is overly sweet. Then there is a too strong sourness that melds into boozy marmelade. Something fishy in the tartan.

Pale orange body, quite clear with a yellow-tinged beige head. Taste is sweet/fruity and somewhat boozy, only late does it find its bitter side and some small measure of dryness. A little sticky but the medium-dull body is more like an oily film, and my teeth are left feeling far more sugar-coated than they should. Toffee and heavy butter. It’s a strange one even for a light/pale Doppel; I would accept reviewers crushing it, but it still maintains a sloppy enthusiasm that’s hard to resist."

Dievels Nat;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Horste;05.04.05 750ml bottle thanks to Matta. Not sure of the brew/bottle date, and I could only make out a 9 out of the numbers on the cork, maybe 1999? Cork took some work to remove, hardly any pfft or pop. Golden-orange, hazy, zero head. Aroma is sherry, dust, leather, brown apple, cobweb, something else herbal and woody that I just can’t figure, and bandaids? Flavor is a mess, age has been harsh to this brew. Dry, dry, dry, with musty sherry, cork, wood, and alcohol. Very thin, totally flat. Finishes bitter and tart. Not undrinkable, but not much left o make this beer worth drinking. Too bad, I bet it was pretty good. Thanks, Matt, it was worth a try!
Dievels Nat;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Horste;was surprised to come across this and another 750ml from the same brewer. After fighting with the cork for 5 minutes...with a wrench, i soon found out why. Flat. Flat like most of Florida flat. So I’ll go into this rating with the *potential* of what it probably should have been..for I could only stomach so much. Orange in colour, the aroma was a basket of citrus and malt. Taste also carried a bit of citrus, but mostly it was a fruitish/alchohol flavour. Some earth tones were preseant though not defined. Had also a pepperish mint-clove spice to it which was nice. I’d probably love this had it not been flat. There are a few more bottles I’ve found around town, but do I want to risk another $7.99. Only time shall tell.
Dievels Nat;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Horste;This bottled brew corked and caged poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized mostly diminishing white colored bubbles that left behind an unnoted lacing. The body contained average carbonation, was transparent and orange in color. Its aroma contained notes of mild orange and malt. Its mouth feel is initially tingly with a very tingly palate. Its flavor contained mild fruity wheat orange vinuous grassy sweet notes and was very tasty. An excellent beer that I would buy again.
Dievels Nat;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Horste;750ml. bottle. Small fizzy white head, sparse lacing, fast rising carbonation, semi-transparent, and a pale yellow hue. Aroma was malty, sweet, fruity, spicy and some clove. Sweet, malty, spicy and a good flavor. Tingly mouthfeel. Medium bodied Belgian. IMO worth a try if you enjoy Belgian style brews.

Main Street Brewery American Hefeweizen;Corona, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);Hazy golden-orange pour with a small white head.

Main Street Brewery American Hefeweizen;Corona, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);Tap at the brewpub. Rating #9. Hazy yellow pour with a white head. Strange aroma, wheat seems to be the them. Flavor was weird as well, the kolsch yeast certainly makes a difference, not something I’m really in favor off, but not that bad, just not what I want in a hef. (1492)
Main Street Brewery American Hefeweizen;Corona, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);"On tap; cloudy, dull goldish color. Aroma was light and wheaty. Flavor was very wheaty with not much else (banana, yeast or spice). That being said, it was still ok tasting."

Main Street Brewery American Hefeweizen;Corona, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);Hazy, unfiltered but served too cold and no head. So chilled that nose is weak until it warms. Not so yeasty-smelling, only slight hints of banana. Quite a thin example, but quaff-friendly soft mouthfeel. A take it or leave it.

Main Street Brewery American Hefeweizen;Corona, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);"Tap@brewery. Golden, clear with white head that took a vacation and didn’t leave anything behind. The most common beer I see pitchers of, besides coors and bud light. Light body, nice carb, lightly dry. Flavor is mild, earthy, ""generic beer flavor,"" lightly wheaty, drinkable. Improves with lemon. My girl put salt in it...so I salted mine...kind of picked it up a bit. Blande, generic."
Main Street Brewery American Hefeweizen;Corona, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);A dark golden honey color with a light white lacing head. A wheat and slightly bready aroma with some citrus. The flavors are of grapefruit and a yeasty wheat. Nothing amazing.
Main Street Brewery American Hefeweizen;Corona, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);Cloudy grungy looking yellow. No head. Has a spicey wheat flavor. Strong flavored wheat beer.
Main Street Brewery American Hefeweizen;Corona, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);Light, pale, cloudy, well carbonated. Clean malty aroma and flavor. Some spiciness towards the end but remaining mild overall. I can see where this might be a cross between a Kolsch and a Heffy. Mild hoppy bite in the finish and underlying citrus. I could classify this as a German Wheat.
Main Street Brewery Precision Pale Ale;Corona, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);"5th March 2019. Part of a four beer flight in Lamp Post Pizza and Main Street brewery, Corona (California). Amber/orange body, clean and clear; off-white head.

Main Street Brewery Mr. Boneworthys Barley Wine;Corona, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);Barrel Draught from the jug at the GABF, Colorado Convention Center 29/09/2005 Golden coloured and very strong in alcohol. Some bitterness in a warming finish.
Main Street Brewery Mr. Boneworthys Barley Wine;Corona, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);Remarkably durable off-white head covers the orange-amber pour. An obviously malt oriented example that offers basically no hop aromas. Rich toffee is just as soon taken for brown sugar or caramel. Chewy extremely sweet biscuity and anisey palate, rather flat carbonation, medium bodied, challengingly strong in alcohol. Hard to drink.
Main Street Brewery Mr. Boneworthys Barley Wine;Corona, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);GABF 2005: Strange color, not sure what to call it but, it had a good head.

Growers MacIntosh Apple Cider;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;I love a sweet cider. Smells of sweet fully ripened macintosh apples. Pours out a golden color with quickly dissipating short, bubbly head. This is like drinking carbonated apple juice with bite. This drink could quite possibly achieve greater commercial success if it were marketed more as an apple cooler rather than cider. Overall, I love it.
Growers MacIntosh Apple Cider;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;Pours a heavily-carbonated yellow reminiscent of club soda. Tangy with a sweet finish. Worth trying as macs do make a good cider.
Growers MacIntosh Apple Cider;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;yellow, and bubbly, but unlike the Dry and the Granny. it doesn’t cloy with the apple acidity. As a matter of fact, it’s very watery. For a cider that’s sort of like a death knell isn’t it?
Growers MacIntosh Apple Cider;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;Let me first start by thanking radiomgb for helping me sample this monster. Yowzazz! I thought I was a fan of cider of the sweetier variety until I tangled with this beast. Pucker up, here she comes! Nose is quite fragrant of apples, what I would call the near sour non-ripe kind. Pour was light and essentially with out head. Flavor was as sweet if not sour as any cider I've had before. Left a clean aftertaste. Bottom line, this stuff was too sweet for me. I never thought I'd see the day I would admit that.
Growers MacIntosh Apple Cider;Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider;Growers Cider Company;(Bottle) Pours no head and a golden-apple body. Aroma of spiced apples.

Castle Eden Special Ale;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Strong Ale - English;Camerons Brewery (UK);Bottle @ pre-GBBF shindig, August 2009. Vintage bottle, circa 2001, from the old Castle Eden brewery (so of interest for that fact). Presumably from the Silk Shropshire Stash. Amber colour. Still has some condition. Unsurprisingly there is a lot of cardboardy oxidation. But the bitterness has survived quite well. Drinkable and not too knackered. Still flagged for re-rate although comparisons with the current incarnation won’t be too revealing.
Castle Eden Special Ale;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Strong Ale - English;Camerons Brewery (UK);A Mes rate: bottle at the ever brilliant Chris O’s Pre GBBF Extravaganza. Dirty amber with a thin white head. Very sweet grainy malt, rather oxidised and cardboardy. Sticky and way past its best.

Castle Eden Special Ale;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Strong Ale - English;Camerons Brewery (UK);Bottled, Pasteurised. Brown red colour, short head. Boiled caramel toffee flavour, a little sharp sourish nut. The beer then disappears without a finish, easy drinking but no challenge.

Silva Original Pils;Miercurea Ciuc, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Romania;Auch in Rumänien wird gerne Bier getrunken. Auch wenn in den Städten auch immer mehr Kleinbrauer auf den Markt treten, so ist das Land doch (noch) fest in der Gewalt der Brauereikonzerne, die das Land mit leicht trinkbarem, aber langweiligen Bier überziehen. Ich weiß nicht, ob es das Bier noch gibt (ich habe es ca 2014 getrunken), aber es würde auch nicht abgehen.

Okult No.2 Rousse;Redange, Luxembourg;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;One of my favorite Amber Ale's and like most of Okult's beer. unique personal touch to it. Amberish colored beer, nice foam, and solid and easy taste.
Okult No.2 Rousse;Redange, Luxembourg;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;Flesje gekregen van Tomhendriksen. ABV 5.0. Amber kleurig, licht troebel bier met matig schuim dat snel weg trekt. Aroma is licht fruiig. Smaak is fruitig en iets bitter. Nasmaak is een beetje hoppig.
Okult No.2 Rousse;Redange, Luxembourg;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;Fles gekocht en geprobeerd in Luxemburg met LiekevdV. Het is een donkerrood kleurig bier met een volle lichtbruine schuimkraag. Het heeft een fruitige geur. De smaak is wat fruitig en licht bitter. Persoonlijk vind ik het een heel goed bier. Valt me heel erg mee.
Okult No.2 Rousse;Redange, Luxembourg;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;Draught: The last of Okults brew, unless there are a stash somewhere. Poured a reddish amber with thick off white head. The aroma was dark bark and leafy. The flavor was roasted malt with hint of leafy dry finish.
Okult No.2 Rousse;Redange, Luxembourg;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;Orange-amberish colored beer with big white-orangey head. This beer has the smell of asitic furniture and has touches of a swetting horse. Afther a while there are some cheezy and rotten pumpkin accents that are comming up. This has indeed a very strange nose. The taste is light and has a watery impression on the middel pallet. Then the very dry bitterness is comming up. The beer has a lively caracter but the balans is going nowhere. The bitterness is unrefined and the afthertaste is bitterish and medicinal.
Okult No.2 Rousse;Redange, Luxembourg;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;Bitter and acidic malt and hops with a somewhat astringent body. Caramel and burnt fruit with a hint of burnt rubber.
Okult No.2 Rousse;Redange, Luxembourg;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;(Bottled, BBE 1/2005) Very hazy amber with a tanned, large head. Caramely, slightly winous aroma with toffee and strawberry. Quite strong, fruity berry flavor with a toffee-caramely feel. Medium-bodied, quite low-carbonated palate. Quite original, but reasonably tasty brew.
Okult No.2 Rousse;Redange, Luxembourg;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;The red beer of the Brasserie Artisanal de Redange has improved, my bottled sample has a creamy head, not lasting enormously long but leaves a residual amount after a few minutes a colour of dusky red/orange, the aroma is of spicy malt, yum yum. The flavour begins with a slight sherbet bflavour on the front of the toungue, washing over the palate to pervade the tastebuds with a medium intensity malty/orangy/fruity flavour. When tha flavour eventually gets to the back of the mouth the gentle hop character comes in - dryly while the rest of the mouth ’sparkles’ with the flavour. This is my favourite of their beers. Note now available in crates of 24x33cl bottles, not just the 6pack cardboard boxes, and available at all Cactus supermarkets in the Grand Duché. Proost
Okult No.2 Rousse;Redange, Luxembourg;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;A beutiful red beer with a beutiful orange head though disappearing.

Faint off white fluffy head with yellowish shine. It has a mild aroma of dry cookies, summer flowers, fresh stone fruits and some lemon-grass. Taste is slight bitter and refreshing. It has a nice malty accent with a dry caracter. The mouthfeel is medium boddied and the afthertaste is crispy bitter.
Okult No.3 Blonde;Redange, Luxembourg;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;(Bottled, BBE 12/2004) Very hazy, light golden color with lots of floating yeast and a large, cloudy, white head.

Okult No.3 Blonde;Redange, Luxembourg;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;Hazy golden coloured. Grainy and slightly fruity aroma. The flavour is grassy and bitter with citrusy notes.
Okult No.3 Blonde;Redange, Luxembourg;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;Apricot colour, hazy. creamy-yellowish head. Very yeasty smell, grainy. Bit of orange zest. Vaguely brettanomyces, leather? Very grainy taste, too, bitter, citrussy, kumquat. Hop only retronasal. Faint perfumed flavours. refreshing mouthfeel, dry but not referring to sugar. Citrus keeps in the aftertaste. This is nice - a blonde like I'd wish more were made.Nothing spectacular, just decent craftmanship.
Okult No.3 Blonde;Redange, Luxembourg;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brasserie Artisinal de Redange;Strange brew! Very artificial lemon aroma like dishwashing soap. Cloudy, yellow, white frothy head, good lace. Soapy lemon flavor, medium body, short finish. Did they use soap to clean the equipement?

Okult Quaffit Stout;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Stout;Brasserie Simon;Tap @ Go Ten, Luxembourg. Nice head with good duration. Color is dark brown. Aroma and taste are soy, roast malt, caramel, fruits, earth, butter and hops. Something gone wrong here in this brew.
Okult Quaffit Stout;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Stout;Brasserie Simon;330ml bottle at home on 9th Oct 2015. The bottle was well out of date: 3rd May 2015, so some 10 years locked away in a mates cellar in Luxembourg. Came out black with a full tanned coloured head. Malty with a semi-sweet caramel lead in both the nose and taste, some fruity notes in there too. A little thin body depth wise but otherwise it was a decent beer considering how old it was, slightly ’on the turn’ with a mild vinegar feel to be honest, but pleased I got the chance to try it. Scored objectively.
Okult Quaffit Stout;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Stout;Brasserie Simon;Pitch black, small creamy tan head. Buttered milk, fermented cherry, roasted rye. Surprising sourness in taste, interesting. Body is quite thin, though and there isn’t much taste development.
Okult Quaffit Stout;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Stout;Brasserie Simon;Säuerlich-malziger Beginn. Später verschiebt sich das Aroma zum Malzigen hin, leider wird das Bier aber gleichzeitig wässrig. Minimale Röstnoten, geringe Schokoladigkeit. Zum Ende wässrig bitter. Verbesserungswürdig! 12/5/6/8//7
Okult Quaffit Stout;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Stout;Brasserie Simon;On tap at Go Ten, with a caramel, malty aroma it has a strong blackberry flavour with a hint of licorice. A long malty finish makes this stout a very nice beer.
Okult Quaffit Stout;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Stout;Brasserie Simon;On tap at Decibel in Luxembourg. It poured a very dark ruby-brown liquid with a small dirty white head. A very mild stout with a some roasted malt in the background. Also some caramel. But I would have preferred more of everything.
Okult Quaffit Stout;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Stout;Brasserie Simon;Tap at Go Ten, Luxembourg City (now brewed by Brasserie Simon, Wiltz). Dark brown, big fluffy off-white head that collapses. Nose is malty, some toasted aromas, but also a kind of funky pils-undertone here too. Some ground coffee. Mouth is light and drinkable, quite a clean taste, pils-y with some hoppiness, not very strong on the maltings. Slightly carbonated with a touch of chocolate and doughiness that lasts in the mouth. Remarkably light palate for a stout. Great to see this beer back, and the best Lux beer by far.
Okult Quaffit Stout;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Stout;Brasserie Simon;"Dark color, creamy head. Peculiar aroma, malt, roasted malt, coffee, cream, cheesy yeast. Medium body structure, sweet, some roasted malt; but both the malt and roasted malt are too soft. The flavor is not up to the expectations after the aroma."
Okult Quaffit Stout;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Stout;Brasserie Simon;"(Bottle 33 cl) Comes simply as ""Redange Quaffit Stout"" - nothing ""okult"" here. Slightly hazy mahogany with a reddish hue. Creamy, beige head leaving a neat lacework. Lightly cocoaish nose. Not overwhelmingly full-bodied with some lightly burned malt. Vinous and very lovely with notes of cocoa and coffee. Light-bitter finish. Unusual but very nice. Organic. What a pity if this brewery is now out of business. 120206"

Golden Bräu Original;Craiova, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Craiova (Heineken Romania);Romanian industrial pale lager, can shared by Trevor at Belgium Chimipalooza. Snow white, moussy, thick and bubbly head over a clear, yellowish straw blonde beer with lively fizz. Aroma of soggy chicken corn, withering lettuce, ‘can iron’, plastic, hint of freshly cut grass. Simple grainy sweet and sourish profile, thin and straightforward, medium carb, minerally aspects, smooth graininess cleanly leading to a thin, bit watery finish more or less saved by a touch of grassy hop bitterishness. Very clean, simple, standard ‘pilsje’, nothing noteworthy going on here, but correct enough within its specific style and better than that depressing Timisoreana.

Creamy mouth feel giving way to mild frothy bitterness, with little flavour on the palate, relatively high carbonation, slight but acceptable sweetness. Overall, a refreshing, light-flavoured, well-balanced supermarket lager that does nothing to stand out from the crowd.

Aass Havørn Pilsner;Drammen, Norway;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aass Bryggeri;(5oo ml Can) Huge, chunky, foamy white head and a golden body. Mild carbonation. Nose of straw and very slight malt. Very mild, light and smooth flavouring - mainly of malt but with a hint of lemon. Finishes with a mild bitterness and remits the can's tinnyness. Fairly good and I think Sigmund is right on with his rating.
Aass Havørn Pilsner;Drammen, Norway;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aass Bryggeri;A continental style pilsener, clean taste, fairly well balanced but a bit on the light side. Brewed by Aass to get market shares in Nordland county (North Norway), sold in southern Norway as well. You could easily drink quite a few of these under the midnight sun.

Lovejoys Hyper Atlas Espresso Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Aroma is a nice coffee, and its appearance is not far off. There are layers of chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee in the start and the finish. The coffee flavors linger nicely on the palate. I noticed quite a few people getting seconds of this offering at the Texas Craft Brewers Festival. A wonderful beer.
Lovejoys Hyper Atlas Espresso Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Dark brown color. Boot and veggie/cream flavor.... No espresso in the nose, just some ugly faint burnt malts and a lot of butter. An unpleasent experience.
Lovejoys Hyper Atlas Espresso Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Average looking stout. I liked the nice roasted coffee in the flavor, which lasts into the smooth finish. Lovejoy's is all about that random gem in the rough. Along with the Doom Vanilla Stout, I'll keep coming back for more.
Copper Tank Copperfest;Austin, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub in Austin, Tx. Medium copper appearance, with a somewhat thick white creamy head. Mouthfeel is a bit artificial and sticky. Flavor has some subtle caramel notes as well as some hints of cotton candy sugarness. Some hints of stale vegetable notes come through in the backend. Not all that bad, would drink again - especially for a $1 a pint - how does this place make money!
Copper Tank Copperfest;Austin, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Pours a pure copper color with a thin, short-lived white head. Semi-sweet aroma of caramel malt. Body starts with a candy-like sweetness, before going through a macro tasting lager stage and finishing lightly caramelized. This could definitely use some balance and could benefit from getting away from whatever yeast they're using.
Copper Tank Copperfest;Austin, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Rather simple, but this grew on me. Plain aroma, nutty flavor and attractive color. (on tap at Austin location)
Copper Tank Copperfest;Austin, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;I may have to say that this is the best octoberfest I have ever had. A color reminiscent of halloween...creamy orange.....full flavor with ginger, thick malt, wheat and chocolate....kickass!
Copper Tank Copperfest;Austin, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Maybe it was just the pour, but there was NO head on mine. Smelled just like a leafy Oktoberfest with a vanilla sort of hoppiness. The flavor suddenly turns sweet toward the finish and then comes out with an unexpected burst-o-chocolate. Didn't really finish like an Oktoberfest, but I liked it a lot. Probably the best Copper Tank beer I've had.

Albert Heijn Herfstbock;Zaandam, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Albert Heijn;Schöne kastanienbraune Farbe im Glas. Der Geruch ist malzig-süßlich und sehr angenehm. Im Antrunk sit das Bier schon relativ süß. Zum Hauptteil kommt schnell eine alkoholische Note hinzu, dazu eine leichte brotigkeit, die mit der karamelligen Süße und der alkoholischen Note eine interessante Geschmackskombination bildet. Der Nachgeschmack ist hauptsächlich klebrig-süß mit einer angenehm zur Malzigkeit passenden Herbe. Auf der Zunge bleibt diese malzbonbon-klebrige Note zusammen mit dieser angenehmen Herbe. --> Viel zu klebrig süß, sonst ok.

Founders Oktoberfest;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);this was a deep amber with a nice biegie head. nice citrus and malt aroma. Medium bodied,with a taste of caramel malt sweetness, fruitness,and a definite citrus hop bite in the finish. I don'tknow how much to style this is, but it was quite an enjoyable brew.
Founders Oktoberfest;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Had this on tap at Jamesport brewery. They have a guest tap that recently has featured Founders stuff and this is great - gives me a chance to catch Founders' seasonals from far away. This one wasn't that impressive, dark and funky, with a significant clash (rather than a balance) between malt and hops. Both are strongly present, but their controversy (which I'd say the malt wins) leaves a kind of unclean sensation, the residue of a battlefield you might say.
Jamesport Weizenbock;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Jamesport Brewing Company;tap at 2012 michigan winter beer festival. i’m not a fan of weizenbocks, but i figured i’d try it anyway. seems true to style at least.

Did not finish sample- almost vomited from the taste of it.
Jamesport Weizenbock;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Jamesport Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a murky raisin color with almost no head. Dried fruit and cherries in the nose. Dried fruits, and cherries that complement the burnt malts. Slight bitterness. Tasty.
Jamesport Weizenbock;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Jamesport Brewing Company;2008 MBG Winter Fest: Hazy brown with a lasting small head. The aroma has some of the things you would expect from the genre and one thing you would not. I found banana, bubblegum, clove, wheat. roasty malt, and walnut esters. I too found an unwelcoming pickle (vinegar) vapours as well. The tastes starts twangy and fruity with sweet bread background but sadly that same flaw of vinegar and sourness detracts from the beer. The mouth feel is light and lively. This is a complete miss and I suspect the beer has gone bad. Would like to re-rate if every given the chance. For now, the worst brew at the fest.
Jamesport Weizenbock;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Jamesport Brewing Company;Draft at brew pub. This brewery is at the very least good on style. Strong dark wheat beer with above average aroma, flavor, appearance and a solid malt finish with a small bite of alcohol. Good job to brewer Tom.
Jamesport Weizenbock;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Jamesport Brewing Company;A really intiguing appearance on this one - huge clouds of sediment cheerfully dancing in the darkness. Reminds me of a small lake on a summer day, myself bobber-fishing for bluegill and watching the sunlight squirm its way into the brown depths. Anyway, the taste features subdued yeasts and esters, nothing strong or bold, but enough spice and citrus to remind you that wheat is involved. It's great when your local brewpub has an adventuresome spirt!
Tuborg T-Beer;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;Really not as bad as the raves indicate. Very much depends on where you get it. Actually has a shelf life with the low amount of preservatives put in to make it cheap. Had it in Turkey and it was just as good as a miller lite. Had it shipped to the US, tasted foul and dirty.
Tuborg T-Beer;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;500 ml can picked up in Sulymanyah, Iraq. Pours a clear gold color with a soft fizzy white head. Aroma is hay, corn and dust. Taste is bland boring chemical filled cardboard. Palate is surprisingly not offensive but also I did not enjoy it and it was not over quickly. Blah
Tuborg T-Beer;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;Süßlicher Getreidegeruch. Muffig wässriger Antrunk, auch im Mittelteil sehr nichtssagend.

Tuborg T-Beer;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;33 cl can. Very light yellow with small white head. Flavour is malt and water.
Tuborg T-Beer;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;Greenish, clear-bottled gold with some momentary scuds of head. Sweet, crackers and sweetcorn aroma accurately predicting the rice and corn-accented mushiness dominating the flavour. Possibly some sweetener and lime. Cooling like shandy after an afternoon by the pool.
Tuborg T-Beer;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;This beer is pretty good, i really lke the flavour which is pretty light and smooth, Good overalle beer allround, thats for sure.
Tuborg T-Beer;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;Clear bottle. Pale straw yellow. Smells like corn nuts, roasted corn, not such a bad aroma. Pretty clean in the mouthfeel. A little too sweet and corny for me but is not all that bad...
Tuborg T-Beer;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;Pale yellow. Clear. Some light fruity notes and a hint of straw-like malts. A little bit nutty in the finish. Pretty inoffensive as pale lagers go.

Via Maria Pietras Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Via Maria Trattoria;Cloudy, yellow appearnce. A pleasant citrusy/tangy hop aroma. The falvour is light and wheaty, yet dry and crisp, not unlike a pils. The stones add a slightly burnt, perhaps granite flavour to the beer. Very interesting style and quite good.

Bitter End Tres Diablos;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Fruity, candy sugar in the lightly spicy aroma. Clear golden body is topped by a low, white, fine bubbled head that lasts well. Candy sugar, some fair spiciness, sweet, fruity, tripel-like flavour with plenty of yeast character. Medium light body with lively carbonation. Sampled at GABF 2005.
Bitter End Tres Diablos;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;This is fantastic beer. I would describe it as a cross between a saison and a tripel. Lovely golden beer. Dense creamy head. Strawy gold. Nose has a serious sweet zest to it around the edges with its center as dry and farmy as a saison. Flavors reflect this. Not too sweet. Malts shine though, but are subdued by a terrific yeast that is very farmy and dry. Hops are slight but noticeable for certain. Bitter slight edge on the end. Great beer. Too short a finish.
Bitter End Tres Diablos;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Sampled @ GABF- Pours a clear golden yellow, small easy white head. Aroma is very pleasent, floral with notes of lemon and spice. Flavor is sweet and balanced, amazing floral and spice notes come out and shine.
Bitter End Tres Diablos;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Light hazy gold topped by a gentle white head. Sweet/spicy nose boasting lots of curacao and coriander, but also a fair amount of hay-like grassyness and mostly fruity (orange, honeyed apricot) malts. Ok, I thought this was a tripel, it certainly had the nice grassy noble hop bite and yeasty phenols. Nice Belgian anyway where the yeast is never out of place, the bitterness moreso from hops than spices and the palate full enough, if a bit too oily.
Bitter End Tres Diablos;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;GABF 2005: Displays a golden hue with a small frothy head and some lace. The aroma has notes of belgian sugar cabdi, corriander, orange zest, flowery and spicy hops, and some wheat notes. The taste is sweet initially but a good tartness follows and keeps it in check. I also got an undertone of fleshy fruit and moderate spice. The feel is sticky and warming, smooth. This is a very good offering, the folks in Austin should be proud of this brewery.
Bitter End Tres Diablos;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Light yellow tall thick white head well laced. Belgian yeast orange rind and spice in the aroma. Full mouth feel warm and creamy. Belgian yeast corriander and lemon peel in the flavor. Over spiced but decent beer.
Bitter End Tres Diablos;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Pale straw. Minimal head. VERY smooth, almost too much, but I won’t fault them for it. Slight spiciness and the hint of corriander. Nice feeling on the tongue.
Bitter End Tres Diablos;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Simple sample, but that said certainly sweet in the ""SWEET!"" sense saying Schwarts skills spell success. Light and lovely, fruity and estery and making me want more."
Bitter End Tres Diablos;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Served in a snifter. I get apricot and tangerine with notes of banana and cloves in the nose. Pours a light gold with a small head and nice lacing. Complex flavors of apricot, vanilla, and sweet malt. Creamy texture. Great triple. I was lucky enough to get a 750ml flip-top bottle of this courtesy of the brewer Brian, and bring it ot the pre-GABF babblefest. It was a hit at the party but I think it is better now than ever.
Ginga Kogen Bakushu;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;I love Ginga Kogen. The best macro brews on the market in Japan. This one is similar to the Ko Mugi. Wheaty, banana-ish. Good.
Evans Stout;Irvine, California, United States;Stout;Evans Brewing Company;Tasted this draft at the Yard House. it is nice to taste a well made stout. Deep dark color, nice creamy head. RIch toasty aroma and a fine toasted chocolate espresso flavor which lingers like a fine wine.
Evans Stout;Irvine, California, United States;Stout;Evans Brewing Company;Had this on draught at McCormick & Schmick's which is connected to the Bayhawk brewery. Toasty, chocolatey, piney aroma. Thick, black coffee taste. A tasty beer, typical of most quality micorbreweries.
Anchor Our Special Ale (2002);San Francisco, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);2002 Bottle gifted by bhensonb. Fortunately, I have an official Anchor Our Special Ale glass for this momentous occasion. The beer pours very dark brown, nearly black with a modest light tan head and a lovely roasted malt aroma. Over the years, the spices and hops have melded with the malt to create a composite rounded flavor. It is still a pleasure to drink, but certainly not as well-defined as I assume it was when first bottled. Roasty dark fruit and a long dry malty finish.
Anchor Our Special Ale (2002);San Francisco, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Thanks to Jon for the share on the magnum. Plummy and all kinds of weird spices. Not really my thing but not awful.

Anchor Our Special Ale (2002);San Francisco, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Spiced winter beer, made with different ingredients each year and available from Thanksgiving to New Year’s Day. The 2002 version had a beige, creamy, stable head and very dark burgundy colour, almost blackish. Strong and very inviting, elegant aroma of coffee, chocolate, cloves, cinnamon, citrussy hops and raisins, taste deep malty, lightly toasted and assertively, dryingly spicy, like a Belgian Christmas ale, dark fruits, long dry hoppy finish. Very complex and very good.

Anchor Our Special Ale (2002);San Francisco, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Bottle. 2002 vintage. Pours a very dark mahogany color with a medium beige head. A fruity nose, oxidation, tobacco, some spices. The flavor is mild oxidation, big caramel, toast, light spices, big tobacco, some leather. Had mellowed away from spice and hops to a more subtle rounder ale. Very good actually. Certainly cardboard, but the oxidation is pretty nice to my taste. I’ve had older OSAs that I didn’t like, this is quite good. 12 years old. Drank in 2014.

The 2000 and 2001 were by far the best - very interesting how this beer has aged especially considering the low alcohol to begin with. Aroma of prune, fig, raisins, bitter coffee and molasses. Mouthfeel is thin, but not too watery with notes of dark fruits, brown sugar, molasses and some spices.

Sailor;Stockholm, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Three Towns Independent Brewers (Galatea);0.33l plastic bottle from Systembolaget Passagen, Stockholm shared with ClubGonzo and Inbreak. My first rated beer from a plastic bottle? It pours this as-good-as-clear golden body with a bubbly off-white head. The aroma has fruity tones, sweet and a bit sourish perhaps. Not to nice, but not to bad either. The carbonation level is average and the mouthfeel is light oily. Tastes quite alright. Lagerish - just a bit more. Dry in the mouth. Some yeast-fruity hints here as well. Drinkable, but not too good. 04.01.2012

Draymans Dark Mild;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Mild Ale;Marston's;2 litre plastic bottle from Tesco. And after buying it, I noticed it was past its sell by date. So I wasn’t expecting much and I didn’t get it. Very dark colour with a hint of red. Distinctly cloudy, which was a surprise. Stagnant malty aroma. Caramel and dark malt flavour. Carbonation is not excessive. Piss weak and very thin. But, in the end, it was perfectly drinkable, so I shouldn’t be too harsh in the marking..

Draymans Dark Mild;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Mild Ale;Marston's;Bottled. This beer seemed ominous - apparently they only sell it in 2litre re-sealable plastic bottles (around 3 ½ pints), and it's dirt cheap, just £2.00 a bottle, which is less than a pint would cost you in a pub. A shade lighter than black, with a bit of red, slight head. Full-bodied - burnt, coffee like taste, with no discernable chocolate flavours and dryish finish. Better than it would appear at first.

The aroma is quite nice, light cocoa and a soft coffeeish aroma on the nose. Some light roast and a touch of tartness. Very light-bodied. OK, but not great.
Garrison Möka Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Garrison Brewing Company;Bottle. Moderate aromas of molasses, dark chocolate and mild coffee for the malt, light herbs for the hops, leather for the yeast, with brown sugar and cola. Head is fizzy with large bubbles, off white, with virtually no lacing and is mostly diminishing.

Garrison Möka Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Garrison Brewing Company;Pours a dark brown, looks sort of like coca cola, but with no head whatsoever. Smells very much like coffee and maybe some other dark malts. Coffee flavor isn’t as apparent as it smell like it might be. It’s a bit sweet and it’s got some nice caramel flavors, not quite as sweet as their nut brown. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, low carbonation and not too thin.
Garrison Möka Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Garrison Brewing Company;I said the stout was the most disappointing beer in the sampler (raspberry wheat, amber, red, nut brown, stout, moka) and it was. I figured this would blow. It did.
Garrison Möka Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Garrison Brewing Company;Bottle. Not much coffee in the aroma. Smoky aroma, but not a pleasant one, more like cigarette smoke. Coca Cola appearance with a thin to no head. Not much coffee in the flavour either. Well maybe a slight hint. Settles to a subtle flavour pushing through which is nice. Overall not to bad really, but nothing special.

Garrison Möka Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Garrison Brewing Company;"341 ml bottle from the Garrison variety 6-pack, purchased at Premier Wine and Spirits in Halifax, NS (May 2007) and sampled around cellar temperature from a Unibroue glass. An enormous creamy tan head fells the glass atop the clear dark walnut body; as it falls it leaves an utterly clean surface....nose is faintly herbal with thyme and wet twigs at first, but the coffee quickly comes in and pretty much wipes out everything else; a bitter, roasty coffee that’s pleasant enough but offers little ""beeriness"" to go with the adjuncts....dry, bitter body is on the thin side with a faintly syrupy quality and a light sweetness at midpalate and after that makes this fairly one-dimensional exercise drinkable....in overall feel it’s more like a schwartzbier than anything else, but not necessarily a good one....leave the coffee to the stouts, boys."
Garrison Möka Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Garrison Brewing Company;Pours a clear red-tinged coffee brown with a thin creamy almond head.

Echigo Lager;Nishikanbara-gun, Niigata-ken, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Echigo Beer Company;"Can. It was a real struggle to find out what the can said. I bought a three pack of cans from this brewer in the basement of a department store in Tokyo. This can was silver and the guy told me it was a Pilsner and said it was a ""malt and rice beer."" It was yellow with a diminishing white head. It had a light body with medium carbonation and rather unremarkable."
Echigo Pilsener;Nishikanbara-gun, Niigata-ken, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Echigo Beer Company;Is this a Pilsner? I like hoppy, light and clear. I like this too. Sweet funky nose leading exactly to a similar flavor. Sticky, skunky, funky feelings bringing back memories of Heinekens back in the day, but not quite that skunked. I had it in a can and I’ll probably not buy it again, but if you hand me a cold one, I’ll smile and knock it back. Cold is important with this bad boy. ABV is 5.5%.

Echigo Pilsener;Nishikanbara-gun, Niigata-ken, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Echigo Beer Company;"350ml Can from Liquor Mountain, Kyoto, Japan (¥246): Very disappointing stuff from Echigo, I was expecting a lot more from this one given the fact that their 90 Days Stout wasn't all that bad. The beer was incredibly basic & at times cheap tasting with a combination of basic vegetable adjuncts & grain dominating for long parts of this one; there was at least some citrus & the odd biscuit malt but not much else really. Some subtle sweetness rounded this one off but I can't imagine it's a beer I'd ever try again."

Aroma of metal, very light malt, some light earth and a touch of water. Light-bodied; Metallic and pungent medicinal flavours at first with a rather large bitterness from malt and a dose of grain with a touch of sweetness on the end and a quite large cardboardie finish. Aftertaste is pretty plain and subdued with a grassy and metallic finish, not showing too much. Overall, a pretty mild beer throughout without much going on at all and only some mellow flavours throughout.

Victory V10;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Rich toffee nose with raisins and prunes. Moderately sweet taste, caramel and toffee, some light oxidation-sherry, some plums. Medium/full body is soft with light carbonation.
Victory V10;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);"(2002 Vintage) Enjoyed from a 750ml bottle in a whiskey snifter. The beer pours a deep ruby/brown color, with a surprisingly lively head, given the fact that the beer was eight years old. Initially very evident in the nose is a strong malt backbone of Belgian specialty grains: caramel and raison. No hop aroma is detectable, but its absence is hardly missed, given a wonderful tinge of sourness that greets the nose instead. The palate is tremendous, balancing the weight of 10%abv with the sourness left by bugs before they petered out from the alcohol’s sanitation power. Malt, sourness, and just the smallest hind of alcohol, before a semi-dry finish. This is easily the best beer I’ve sampled from Victory; no small feat. Wonderful."
Victory V10;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Bottle. Pours an amber body with an off white head. Fruit laden etoh with fruity esters dark plums, raspberries, and hint so fruit juice. A Mildly tart lush fruit etoh finish. Good stuff.

Victory V10;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Bottle Dated 11-7-03: Thanks to BeerGod for dropping this one by. A nice sour and musky aroma. Pure red body with a light ivory head. A very sour initial hit with a good amount of malts and berry hints in the taste. Smooth ending. Overall it’s bordering on a Flemish sour style beer at this age, though this might be due to a bit of an infection.

Thanks, Aaron! Pours a hazy reddish orange with a small off-white head. Nose is slightly oxidized with some tart red fruits, caramel, a bit of brown sugar. Flavor is also slightly tart, but not altogether in a bad way, with some dark fruits and oxidation.
Tsingtao HuiQuan Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Apparently a not-too-bad one in the Tsing Tao macro universe. Pale golden with soapy head and the typical foul macro aroma. However taste hasn’t got that owful corn syrup sweetness of most macro lagers, with a strong malty character. Good for sessions... but... it’s all chemicals and fake crap. Watch the bowels the next day!
Tsingtao HuiQuan Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Pours gold with a bright yellow tint. White head almost disappears completely after a few minutes. Weak malt smell and a little corn. Forward bite. A little barley a little corn and a little sweet. Good on the Mai Fan in Xinfeng with friends.
Tsingtao HuiQuan Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);330ml can purchased in Myanmar. Manufactured Jan 2011 so probably past its best. Pours a very hazy yellow. Aroma is of cardboard, soap and grain. Taste is sharp corn and tart fruit.

Tsingtao HuiQuan Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);"330 ml can bought at Wellcome Superstore in Sheung Shui. Piss pale golden yellow colour; Razor-thin head and residual white foam which fades in 10 seconds; Near zero lacing and notable carbonation; Sweet pungent smell of malt, rice, grains, traces of lemon and grass; Very light sweet taste of weak malt, with strong rice, hint of wet cardboard, and notes of citrus & grass; Light body, thin but slightly slick palate; Taste profile is very low rice and grains, with malt taste being not as low as I expected. Sweetness is low and harmless, almost Pils-like. No foul taste as wet cardboard hint becomes less and less evident with further sips. Not bad! Hoppiness is very low citrusy grass nose / taste, and detectable bitterness for a semi-finish; Pretty dry after taste, very easy to mouth. Comments: Amazingly, this is one of the better offerings by oft-disappointing Tsingtao. In fact, it’s much better than many of the Tsingtao’s propers: it’s a macro alright, but how often when you come across a macro with near zero sweetness, very low adjunct taste, decent lean body, no foul taste, and finish the whole thing with good degree of satisfaction? Here’s one of them and it’s inexpensive. Like the Yanjing Draft 4.5% 11°P, this one gets the most bang out of my bucks. A macro gem!"
Tsingtao HuiQuan Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Small offwhite coarseish head doesn’t last. Clear yellow body with light carbonation. Light perfumy jasmine aroma with floral notes. Dry-sweet mealy jasmine taste with floral notes. Mid-to-light body. Mild, soft mouthfeel. Dryish floral perfumy jasmine aftertaste. OK, so this beer is the same all the way through. Fairly nice, certainly drinkable, and perhaps even slightly subtle. (0.64l bottle, Wellcome, Lohas Park, Hong Kong.)
Tsingtao HuiQuan Beer;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);Aside from the boring appearance, this has a really strong smell of alcohol and rice, and not in a good way.

Aroma of cardboard with some grassy touches and almost nothing else. Light-bodied; Strong malty and metallic flavour with water a touch of funky cardboard. Aftertaste is just as bland with not much going on as well, only showing some subdued grain and a touch of grass with some super mellow sweetness as well from caster sugars. Overall, a pretty poor beer of course and showing some mellow flavours, water and funky notes. Nothing worth trying, unless you are trying to cool down a tiny bit on the streets of Hong Kong and can’t find anything else that you haven’t had in the stores here. I sampled this 500 mL KING Can purchased from Wellcome Supermarket in Tsim Sha Tsui on 30-July-2017 for HK$9,50 sampled on the Star Ferry going back to Central Hong Kong [island] on 30-July-2017."

Tsingtao Draft Beer 8º;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);OK, I recently visited China and got to try a bunch of their beers, which I will rate. So that I won’t have to repeat myself with each review, let me say that the Chinese prefer lite, weak beers, served cold. This does make some sense because they usually drink along with meals, and their beers do go well with Chinese food. But on their own, the way craft beer aficionados prefer to drink them, they are pretty worthless. Tsingtao is a good place to begin, because it is China’s best known beer, and it is a pretty typical example. Actually it is one of the worse brews. Bland, lite, no aroma, just a hint of flavor, hardly any hops, etc.
Tsingtao Draft Beer 8º;Qinqdao, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tsingtao Brewery (Tsingtao);5ooml can from Carrefour, Xiamen. Pours pale yellow with a dissipating white head. Aroma cardboard and malt. Watery, sweet finish.

Clear pale yellow colour with a tiny white head. Apple juice and some mild chemical notes in the weak aroma. The flavour is... non existing... maybe mild malt and mild chemical notes. Blah... Bad.
Blue Girl (5.0%);Hong Kong;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jebsen Beer;Bottle at an unknown night BBQ in Hong Kong. Poured a crystal clear golden colour with a thin broken white head and lots of bubbles. The aroma is malt, cardboard, water. The flavour is light, bitter sweet, with a light, watery, corn hay, light hop bitter palate. Light bodied with average carbonation. Truly awful. Who drinks this stuff.
Blue Girl (5.0%);Hong Kong;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jebsen Beer;The foam stability is medium, the body gold. The Aroma is malty a bit bitter. The taste is malty, a bit hoppy, balanced. Only a bit sweet and a bit watery.

Blue Girl (5.0%);Hong Kong;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jebsen Beer;Mate bought a six pack from Chen Lien in Taipei City. Not one to play devils advocate but this is not that bad for a Korean lager. Hite and Cass literally have no taste at all. At least this tastes like a weak pilsener. I would never recommend it but, at the same time if you were eating a whole lot of kimchi, there are worse beers in Taiwan... Such as Bar or Asahi Kanpai ( the horrid one made in China). It is generic but not disgusting.

Blue Girl Draft;Hong Kong;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Jebsen Beer;The anomaly here is that it is less alcoholic but more flavoursome. Having said that it still is not one of those great beers that makes you want to have a session with. Overall still dull and unexciting.
Blue Girl Draft;Hong Kong;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Jebsen Beer;Can. A little more head than the regular Blue Girl and also a little more bite in the palate. The aroma is floral. Still a weak flavor. The draft is smoother and what little flavor exists is carried better in the Draft can. This can be found all over Hong Kong.
Big Time Sabbatical Belgian Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Big Time Brewery;Is a hazy light brown color with some soft hoppy notes and wood and oranges. Orange peel, caradom, wood mouth with a zesty orange finish.
Big Time Sabbatical Belgian Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Big Time Brewery;Slightly minty, saazy hop aroma (sterling?)

Marlyns Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);"Best before 10-2007. I hate to think would it would taste like after that date. I bought this 6-pack in Mexico, just needing some swill. I thought this might’ve been a domestic. Such surprise when back aboard the ship this turned out to be Dutch beer. At least the colour was decent, and at 318 pesos for 6 cans, the cheapest beer I oculd find in Acapulco. The smallish head ran away and hid almost immediately; should’ve taken this as a hint of things to come, that and the ’curious’ aroma; I cannot place what the scent is. Taste is simply not pleasant, nor is the aftertaste. Difficult to describe is the best I can do. I’d rather have had a Corona..."
Marlyns Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);bottle. Clear pale yellow, mid-sized head. Malty, slightly hoppy, a bit thin and watery.
Marlyns Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Well nothing special in this one, a cheap beer also a cheap flavour, it’s not bad just the classic lager flavour.
Marlyns Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Sampled in Cabo San Lucas, Mx. Golden amber color. Head is big and soapy. Interestingly, the foam doesn’t so much dissipate as it does collapse. It leaves a lacing like over cooked oatmeal. No carbonation at all. Nose is rice as is the flavor. A bit of malt.
Marlyns Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Nice grassy hop aroma, somewhat orange to be a Pale-Lager appareannce, good flavor, a some corn present for sure, good amount of carbonation for this style, not quite bad, feels different than Bavaria, tough they¨re from the same company and have the same style.Good the price is affordable to in Mexico for being a Dutch bier 28 pesos a six-pack ( 2.50 dlls).
Marlyns Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Nice, soft flavour with sweet honey-like traces. Nice pricing and extremely environment-friendly cans :P Great treat as for for everyday drinking.
Marlyns Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Clearly this is Bavaria’s export to the Latin American countries. I found it in the WalMart in Cancun (roughly $2 for a six-pack). A pretty standard low-end pale lager, noteworthy only for a more-bitter-than-average finish in my opinion.
Marlyns Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Clear, golden beer with a small frothy white that fades away quickly but leaves a passable lacing. Its aroma is very smooth, sweet with flowers ans grain touches. The flavor is sweet too but watery and the flat carbonation does not help it.
Marlyns Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);"Pours a clear gold lager with a average white diminishing head that leaves a decent lacing. Soft aroma based on malty grains and hoppy herbs and grass. Typically lagerish. Sweet initial flavor but extremely watery character which leaves little space to bitterness. Soft carbonated and I would say it tastes like a watery ""macro lager"". At least it’s clean."
Marlyns Beer;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);NOt bad, not a great beer, I had a normal day with it refreshing but extremely lager.
Stag Pale Pilsen;Laguna, Philippines;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Asia Brewery Inc.;"Their website says this beer is brewed with the younger drinkers in mind. Mothers milk it ain’t so that contention is rubbish. The residents of that eponymous town in the Czech Republic must shed a tear each time their fair home is taken in vain. Perhaps the brewers whould look at renaming this. An anagram of the beer is ""Spangle spit ale"" so this could be a more apt description."
Stag Pale Pilsen;Laguna, Philippines;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Asia Brewery Inc.;Can. A dusty piss smell but the flavor is slightly smoother. I found this in Hong Kong.

Harbin Beer;Harbin, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);Just don't get your hopes up. It's a light lager from China. Of course it's going to taste like metal, corn and water - it's supposed to. Unfortunately, despite feeling refreshing at first, the aftertaste is too unpleasant for even my liking.
Harbin Beer;Harbin, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);One of the worst beers I’ve ever had. Just tastes like the let corn rot in some water and let it ferment. Not worth the calories. Not even close

Harbin Beer;Harbin, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);Typical macro style lager. Extremely light, very little hop or aroma. Did appreciate the mild malting, but overall was a tad sweet and had a corn like aftertaste.

Redd's Apple (Premium Gold);Poznan, Poland;Flavored - Fruit;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);400ml bottle. Clear golden colour, white head instantly disappears. Aroma is mostly a sweet apple syrup, some malt in the background. Taste of sweet apple syrup, sugary, hint of malt, overall not very beer like at all, and artificial. Body is light, thin, average carbonation. It's weird but not that bad for a fruit beer I suppose. Needlessly sexist marketing aside I don't mind it but wouldn't have it again.
Redd's Apple (Premium Gold);Poznan, Poland;Flavored - Fruit;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Backlog. Synchronizing with notes and Untappd. Artificially sweet. More of an apple juice than a beer. Corpolager on syrup steroids. Still no flaws except the artificial character of this brew.
Steelhead Hearthside Wheat Wine;Eugene, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Steelhead Brewing Co.;"2002 draught chalice at Redbones on 11/28/06 Still and glassy, not hazy, yet nor is it clear. Small whisp of beige colored head immediately fizzles to nothing. A vibrant auburn-mahogany-magenta color is the body. No lacing. Crystal malt adds a hardness to the nose, unfolding in to breadiness and even a light touch of doughy yeast. Strong, rather narrowly focused citric-like fruitiness is quite sharp at first, combined with the wheat dryness producing the hard, edgy, rather difficult nose similar to Smuttynose’s wheatwine. Alcohol warmth is evident beneath layers of dry caramel and breadiness, with just a pinch of chocolate sweetening things before being cut off by a dry dough and wheat-like finish. But with warming and extended breathing, as is the case with most vintage high gravity beers, the beer takes on a completely new profile. The sharp, focused citric twanginess fully loosens and you get a much more complex, softer array of cherries, oranges, apricots and plums. More caramel/chocolate character can be seen, in a sweeter sense, while the yeast, wheat and breadiness all seem to fade to some extent. Playful spiciness emerges as well, combining with the fruitiness pleasantly, while no fusels come off the liquid and instead the alcohol warmth seems evenly matched by the emerging sweetness/softness. Medium strength of aroma, but it increases as it warms, while oxidation (light madeira) only accounts for about five to ten percent of the nose, and quite inoffensive at that. Similar story in the flavor; the beer greatly improves with patience. Hard marmalade and crusty/dry crystal malts initially seem too aggressive and unsupported, while wheat is mainly dry and lightly sourish. But breathing allows more varied, softer fruitiness and more sticky sweetness. Fortunately, the dryness never leaves and the beer ends up well-balanced. It achieves the best of both worlds, almost a candied apple sort of flavor. With the hardened candy shell representing the hard, yet still semi-sweet crystal malt and the apple representing the more soft, easygoing fruitiness. Texture is slippery at times, lightly sticky and generally pretty smooth from the wheat. Carbonation is extremely low, would have been interesting to see what it was like with more, but it dosent seem to hurt the beer at this level, just emphasizes its sipping nature. Alcohol warmth is ever-present, but never sharp or obnoxious. Quite complex and in very good condition for four years of age."

Steelhead Hearthside Wheat Wine;Eugene, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Holy intense beer! The color was a full on intense cherry wood, with a nice fluffy off white head. Some great lingering lacing. The mouthfeel is so big with intense complexity that it is almost overwhelming. Almost syrupy when it warms, is my only compaint, lots of big malt characteristics, fresh breads, fruits light and dark, with some maple syrup, caramel and cookie dough, the finish is full of raisins, dates and plums. I really love this beer.
Steelhead Hearthside Wheat Wine;Eugene, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Steelhead Brewing Co.;On tap at the Lucky Lab barleywine fest. Pours a very clear red/mahogany with a nice off-white head. Sweet caramel and cookies in the aroma with a very heavy body and rich malt taste. As this warms the caramel malts show more over the wheat with a slight date taste in the finish. Very smooth and hid the alcohol very well.
Steelhead Hearthside Wheat Wine;Eugene, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Sampled draught at The Rose & Raindrop, PortlandTawny color, short head, little lacing.

Clear, ruby red glowing, dark brown colour with small, frothy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, tan head. Sweet aroma with hints of molasses, liquorice, artifical cherry or raspberry ’Laffy Taffy’ (or ’Maoam’). Taste is artificially sweet, artificial cherry and/or raspberry flavours again. Strange."
Hong Kong Beer Co. Dragon's Back IPA;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Brown Ale;Hong Kong Beer Co.;The story around his ale is actually better than the beer itself. Anyway it was a really nice brown ale. Not an IPA as the label says. Once upon a time Monika was in Germany with her dogs again, and off course she had to do some beer shopping for me. By a coincidence I did see that some other lads had bought a beer from Hong Kong at a grocery store close to where she camped. So…… Well she found them and I was happy. A whole crate actually. Yeah I could trade a lot with these. My good pal Terje should off course get one. And when we sat down in his space rocket we discovered that it was an IPA, not the expected pale shait. Ahhhh damned we could not drink it that day and I wanted to taste it as well. Okey so he kept it in his closet at work. Well we thought we could share it quite soon…….due to a wild bicycle race, Ullevål Hospital and other small events….it stayed in that WARM closet for almost 1,5 year. Should we ever manage to kill this one? Off course we are proper gentleman and do not waste beer. Well it was a thick, so….well at last the moment arrived. On a bus, in a plastic cup, on our way to a beer festival, surrounded by a whole lot of football hooligans. Mama mia. Well the bald football fans are actually my friends and probably the kindest football and beer lovers in the known universe. The Hong Kong IPA turned out to be a fine brown ale, and the storing in Terjes closet at work had not killed it at all. BB was passed 8 months ago. But we survived. Maybe the plastic cups from Østfold Hospital had some antibiotics that helped us. Who knows, but I will always remember this one. Cheers!
Hong Kong Beer Co. Dragon's Back IPA;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Brown Ale;Hong Kong Beer Co.;It’s finally time to put this poor bottle out of it’s misery. It’s been staying in a cupboard in my office for more than a year, experiencing highly varying temperatures ranging from 18 to 27ºC. Let’s see how the impropriate storing has influenced this beer. The aroma is moderate and mainly malty and nutty, with notes of pale malts, grain, bakers yeast and dark dried fruits. There are some hoppy notes as well, but they are much weaker than what an IPA should provide. Moderate flavour that also is mainly caramel malty, with additional dark dried fruits, faint metal and hints of orange marmalade (yay, some IPA-ish traces!). Moderate to light sweet and light to moderate bitter taste. Light to medium body, a bit watery texture and quite dry. Not too bad.

Hong Kong Beer Co. Dragon's Back IPA;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Brown Ale;Hong Kong Beer Co.;08.03.2014. 0,33l Bottle. Thanks to abemorsten for the trade. New country, first ever from Hong Kong!! Black colour with dark tan head. Aroma is sweetish dark malts. Rather mild with good malt flavours. Low on bitterness. sweet with kind of ligth mouthfeel. At the end its just more malt sweetness and no bitter finish.
Hong Kong Beer Co. Dragon's Back IPA;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Brown Ale;Hong Kong Beer Co.;330ml Flasche. Braune Farbe, geringe Schaumkrone. Geruch malzig, leicht röstig, Citrus. Geschmack bittersüß, wässrig im Abgang, daher süffig.
Hong Kong Beer Co. Dragon's Back IPA;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Brown Ale;Hong Kong Beer Co.;The label on the bottle says Hong Kong Dragons Back IPA, but surprisingly this neither tastes or looks like any IPA I have ever tried. The appearance is dark brown, almost black with a creamy tan head. Well carbonated but overly sweet and very low on bitterness and hops. It’s quite okay however, ranks amongst the best beers I have tried from far east Asia. It’s certainly better than most of the typical low ABV Asian macro adjunct lagers, and it’s relatively cheap. But with that said this beer is not something I’m likely going to buy again, as these are only sold by the box (24x) here in Sweden, and it probably doesn’t get better with age.
Hong Kong S.A.R. Brewing Co. Too Soo Brew;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hong Kong Beer Co.;Haven’t seen this one for a while, but it was the least impressive of the offerings from this brewery and not a patch on the AB. Still, a refreshing enough drink with peanuts in the East End, Causeway Bay.
Hong Kong S.A.R. Brewing Co. Too Soo Brew;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hong Kong Beer Co.;Draft. Exact same color as the pale ale, a nice deep copper-gold color. Nice lacing. Aroma is uninviting, acrid and sour like from infection. Slick, thin palate. The flavors are not as bad as the aromas but the acrid, weird fruitiness is there. Cannot enjoy this one.
Hong Kong S.A.R. Brewing Co. Too Soo Brew;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hong Kong Beer Co.;Draught @ Causeway Bay location. Dark straw colour. Limey sour character on the nose does not bode well. Floral character. Soft body - creamy - with light caramel and slightly biscuity malts. Finishes with breezy fruity hops and a light malt stickiness on the tongue.
Hong Kong S.A.R. Brewing Co. Too Soo Brew;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hong Kong Beer Co.;pours a pale orange-amber with a small biege head, and good lacing. smell is of corn, malt, some citrus, and a few nuts. taste is sweet, malt, honey nut, and ends a touch on the bitter side.
Hong Kong S.A.R. Brewing Co. Too Soo Brew;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hong Kong Beer Co.;Pretty bitter - kind of a US pale ale or UK IPA. Fine, but not my style. Enjoyed on tap at Hong Kong’s East End Brewery (Quarry Bay).
Hong Kong S.A.R. Brewing Co. Too Soo Brew;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hong Kong Beer Co.;Draft, at the East End Brewery, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. Golden lager with a soft white head. Hung over as fukc this beer went down surprisingly smoothly. Silky, satin like blend of malts. Really quite a lovely drop. No sharp edges and served cold. Quality place this by the way a quite a good selection of American micros, the Belgians lineup was a bit simple but nonetheless still present and accounted for.
Hong Kong S.A.R. Brewing Co. Too Soo Brew;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hong Kong Beer Co.;Sampled draught at East End Brewery, Hong Kong Island. Amber colour, small head. Fruity and medium bodied with bold, clean mouthfeel. The malt profile is quite rich, but also simple, and there is a lightly hoppy finish.
Hong Kong S.A.R. Brewing Co. Too Soo Brew;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hong Kong Beer Co.;This beer has a good amber appearance and a thin creamy head. The fact that the laws in HK are fairly lax when it comes to smoking in a bar means that a beer evaluation is a bit tricky. That and the strange states when you sniff, hold to the light and cradle the beer as it is too bloody cold. Anyway the nose is minimal but the flavour is quite full, a real welcome change from the thin Asian beers tried so far. The lacing in the glass is firm and consistent as it goes down. Overall a good beer that at least tries to impress.
Jersey Harvest Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Brewed by Hunterdon Brewing Company, Califon, NJ. Tawny Amber orange color topped by a bubbly beige head. Robust, earthy, sweet caramel malt nose. Bittersweet toasted malt flavor hints at maple syrup. Pleasant hoppy finish.
Jersey Harvest Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;Pours a deep clear amber with a small off-white head. Aroma of grain and caramel. The flavor is mostly toasted and chocolate malt with notes of caramel and toffee. The finish has some moderate peppery hop bitterness. Medium body with lively carbonation. No lacing left on the glass, not much head retention. Even though there’s nothing special about this brew, I feel it’s malt character has more to offer than most amber ales.
Jersey Harvest Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;Didnot realize thiswas from river horse. This was a pleasant amber ale. This was a good amber, poured amber, nose had caramel and some nuts. There was sweetness and a bitter finish.

Jersey Harvest Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;From 12 oz bottle. Small head that had some decent staying power and a touch of lacing. The beer itself is a nice brown. The carbonation lasted longer than I expected. First sip gives a touch of caramel sweetness and a nice bitter flavor, the latter of which lasts nicely into the finish. Good beer and goes at a better price than more expensive ones of its caliber.
Jersey Harvest Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;Pours a light copper with a thin white head, some vegetable notes in the aroma with the patented microbrew malty aroma. Flavor has some ripening vegetable notes with some faint caramel notes. Decent, but fades fast. Thanks to Aurelius for this.
Jersey Harvest Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;Toaste malt nose, dark amber color, low creamy head. Caramelly malt with a dainty dry bitter end. Mdeium body and a fairly smooth balance. This surprised us. Dave likes it too.
Jersey Harvest Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;"No mentioning of ""Harvest"" on my bottle Clear amber, good yellowish head, creamy in substance. Cookie, caramel, light-roasted malts, bit of peanut(butter) aroma. Dull-bitterish taste. Not really hoppy, neither dark malts, even when malty sweetnes is very present underneath. Toffee-caramel finish, pineapple flavour, even a bit of Maillard? Bitterish returns in the aftertaste. Medium bodied, smooth. Quite drinkable, nowhere extraordinary."

Jersey Harvest Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;A nice malty-grainy aroma, with an amber cast. Decent label. Flavor has good character - some floral/perfume-y elements, a bit of astringency, toasty malt. Moderately sweet, moderately hopped. Borders on the bock-y sometimes. Medium to medium-heavy mouth with a lingering fruit and perfume aftertaste. Dries out and goes a little crackery in the finish. Good malts.

Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Marzen;Tokyo, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Ishikawa Brewery;"Tap. Light mahogany, small eggshell head. Exceptionally well-balanced!! A little bit of sweetness, very natural/organic tasting, bready malts. ""Leafy"" comes to mind but this might be some strange word-association.

Primátor Světlý;Náchod, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Náchod (LIF);Dieses Bier habe ich schon vor langer Zeit einmal getrunken und auch die Brauerei in Náchod gesehen. Wurde das Bier vor 2017 noch in klassischen 0,5l-Norm-Flaschen abgefüllt, so fand ich es in der Weihnachtszeit 2018 in einer eigens gestalteten Primatór-Flasche. Auf den neuen Etiketten wurde es neuerdings auch als Craftbier tituliert, obwohl es sich im jene Sorten handelt, die die Brauerei eh schon ewig produziert und vorher ohne diesen Zusatz verkauft wurden. Aber gut. Das alte neue Bier ist ein klassisches tschechisches Helles mit einer enormen Süffigkeit, wie es sich für ein solches Bier gehört. Es lässt sich wunderbar bei einer Zugfahrt oder auch zum Essen genießen. Bei dem Bier kann man nichts falsch machen: solide Qualität mit gutem Geschmack.

Primátor 24 Double;Náchod, Czech Republic;Bock - Doppelbock;Pivovar Náchod (LIF);Aroma of spicy & salty licorice. Black with a long lasting brown head. Sweet taste. Full bodied, creamy texture & soft carbonation
Primátor 24 Double;Náchod, Czech Republic;Bock - Doppelbock;Pivovar Náchod (LIF);Dark brown color, durable foam. Sweet malty aroma. Alcohol is well-hidden, but can be noticed. That would be a great malty strong beer, but there's too much sugar in it. Makes this beer unpalatable. I know that would be much different, and would have an aftertaste with unbearable alcohol-taste.

Aromat mleczny, słodowy, po czasie pojawia się śliwka, palność i niestety alkohol. W smaku idealnie zamaskowany alkohol! Mleczne, karmelowe, palone. Bardzo pijalne jak na swój alko. Nisko-średnio wysycone, niska goryczka. Plus za mleczność, laktozę i zamaskowanie alkoholu, ale to trochę za mało.

Rockslide Oktoberfest;Grand Junction, Colorado, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rockslide Brew Pub;The last beer I had at the brewpub. A unusual beer, but nice. A unfiltered cloudy copper color with almost no head, this brewery must prefer light carbonation.

Great Lakes Oktoberfest;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"Nose is super malty; caramel and plum notes (It reminds me of Troegnator). Amber coloring that matches the fall leaves. Very smooth and sweet like honey. Slight hop, bitter bite (that’s pleasant) that finishes with a sweet, dried fruit taste like a plum. Cheers!"

This is rich with a bready and malty taste (but not overpoweringly caramel), and finishes with slight spices before ending sweet. Quite a flavorful representation of the style! A very distinct and dignified Oktoberfest.

Aroma of mildly toasted grain. Taste is light sweet malt up front, lightly toasted cereal, finishes with just enough hops to counter the slight sweetness. Enjoyable.
Great Lakes Oktoberfest;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);The pour was surprisingly fun. It gathered a frothy, lightly orange head that covered the glass with perfect lacing. Its bubbly amber color was clear. The aroma was very subtle, but it sweet and toasty. Its texture was refreshing and very smooth. The taste is incredibly smooth, yet satisfying. The toasty malt flavor lingers on. Considering how much I haven't liked smooth Oktoberfest beers, I actually like this one a lot. While it is crisp and easy to drink, it has layers that other smooth Märzen beers are missing. I highly recommend this forum an American Märzen-style lager.
Great Lakes Oktoberfest;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);It's no secret that Great Lakes is skilled with brewing German styles, so it's hardly surprising that they make a great Oktoberfest. This fest pours a clear copper shade with plenty of light tan suds on top. This brew has a bit more of a grainy, toasty caramelized sugar note and slightly fuller body when compared to some beers in this category, but even with that extra sweetness it doesn't really feel out of place for the style. Excellent.

Unique Beer Toasted Coconut Porter;Orlando, Florida, United States;Porter;Orlando Brewing Company;On tap. No head just a thin rim of bubbles. Roasted malty aroma similar to a porter. Watery mouthfeel. Nutty flavor with a hint of coconut on the finish. Interesting.
Unique Beer Toasted Coconut Porter;Orlando, Florida, United States;Porter;Orlando Brewing Company;had this on tap in two different locations. first time, better body (palate/mouthfeel???) and carbonation. second time it was quite flat. dark ebony color, roasty but sour aroma. the flavor was somewhat nutty but not at all what i was expecting. (i was expecting more of a coconut tang) sorta like a weak porter that wanted to be a lager. i have a confession to make--the second time i had a ''taster'' of this beer (which was about 4 oz) but i ordered a bottle of duvel after trying this. thing is, the duvel didn''t live up to my last tasting of it either, so i mixed the two. it was pretty tasty.

Kloster Bier (Thailand);Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;"(Bottle 33 cl) Looks like a licensed German beer, but I haven’t been able to track down ""Klosterbrauerei Neustadt A/D"" and for good reason, as it seems to be a completely fake company! Weird... Anyways, the beer is rather pale with a pretty fine head. Nice aromatic hops in the nose. Mild with some hop-bite on the palate. Not that bad. Basically the same company as produces ""Singha"" - ""Boon Rawd"". 101103"
Kloster Bier (Thailand);Bangkok, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boon Rawd;"The hope of any kind of change from ""Singha on ice"" attracts ye wounded prey.

Kona Castaway IPA;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;IPA;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);This is a backlog rating from 2015 on draft in a flight at Ei8ht Ball, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are lemon citrus, pale malts, light toast, soapy florals.

Kona Castaway IPA;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;IPA;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);One of konas better ones. Nice aroma, pretty bronzish color, and good taste ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Kona Castaway IPA;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;IPA;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);One of the better Kona's out there. At first it seemed a little off balance, leaning too much on the hops and could use a bit more malt. But, for semi-macroish brew, they are aiming for a West-Coast type hop bomb, which this definitely has some bitter to it. A clear medium yellow to light orange appearance. Lots of tropical and citrus flavor.....maybe some passionfruit too. Growing on me towards the end of my single sample. Not sure I'd be too happy with a 6 of this, but something I can drink here or there.....kind of curious to see what it's like on tap now.
Golden Avalanche Oktoberfest;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;On tap, at the brewery. This one seemed like a watered down version of their Alt. That doesn’t make it bad, but after having the Alt first, this was abit of a letdown.
Golden Avalanche Oktoberfest;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub. Subtle smell of pine, malt, hop, citrus, and spice. It had a powerful flavor of spices and a good hop backbone. Possibly some banana and/or apple as well?

Listed as Utah Crimson Ale: ESB. Pours a cloudy bronze color with a large white head. A hoppy aroma; sweet citrus and toasted malts.

Magic Hat Braggot;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Mead;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Cloudy orange pour with a mild aroma of honey. An earth taste that finishes with amedium bodies dry honey taste. It was ok.
Magic Hat Braggot;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Mead;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);On draft at Union Jacks Pub in Glenside. Pours a light copper amber with a small white head. Aroma of light spice, honey sickle and hops. Taste is much the same as the aroma.
Magic Hat Braggot;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Mead;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Draft at Blind Tiger. Poured a clear medium orange color. The head was two fingers high and white. Smelled of apple and honey touched cereal grain. The nose reminded me of a poorly made lager. Light to medium bodied and slightly sweet. Tasted of subdued sweet cream, corn, and honey. Almost cream ale-ish. Eh.
Magic Hat Braggot;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Mead;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Tap at the Blind Tiger. Very cloudy pour with a surprising head. Grainy, honey and alcohol aroma is expected. Not much complexity. The flavor, man, I can’t take it at all, the sweetness totally kills me. I’m coming to realize I absolutely detest the braggot style.
Magic Hat Braggot;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Mead;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Tap @ BT. Strange. Figured this one would stick around. Almost no aroma. Taste is fizzy and watery with a touch of honey.
Magic Hat Braggot;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Mead;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);On Tap at the Blind Tiger in NYC. Had no clue this was a mead/beer when I ordered it. Just knew I’d never heard of it before. Poured a bit of a cloudy yellow orange color with a thin white head. Aroma was honey and malt, a bit of vanilla and oakiness. Flavor was on the sweet side with a bit of herbal character. Pretty mild overall though.
Magic Hat Braggot;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Mead;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Draft at EBF. Pours a golden body with a thin white head. Lots of honey and apple up front, light vinous character dry with a thin oak body. Decent.
Magic Hat Braggot;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Mead;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);EBF NOTB 08. Pours a hazy deep golden- almost coppery with a fizzy white head. Aroma is very appley pie like- with some green apple skin- diacetaldehyde character with some vanillafromt he wood and oak- also a bit tart and malo- like white wine light sweetness with some floral honey components. Flavor is a bit doughy and yeasty, tart, more apple skin and apple wine- sweet flavros some residual honey, grassy, and a slick sweetness- some fruitness as it warms like pear and more apple.
Magic Hat Braggot;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Mead;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"NOTB; it was aged in chardonnay barrels. If that requires a new entry, than I’ll move this. This beer you could really detect the chardonnay aging. Aroma was generally earthy with apples, fruit and white whwine. Flavor had the same characteristics. Good stuff."
Magic Hat Braggot;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Mead;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Sampled at the source, chardonnay barrels very evident. A very beer-ish meade or meade-ish beer. Unique style, but very good. The type of honey seems to be interpreted differently by individual palates.
Magic Hat E Squared;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pleasant but not fantastic bitter. It is nice to get a decent bitter on draft in the states. Unfortunately, not as strong as other Magic Hat brews. The hops are handled professionally and really outdistance the malt. Nicely served at room temperature with a lot of bubble activity.
Magic Hat E Squared;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Magic Hat Beer Tasting, Brighton, MA --This ""Experimental Elixir"" from Magic hat is made from the second sparging of the malt used to create their barley wine. It's a golden yellow in color with a hoppy aroma that's not displeasing (especially for me, who can sometimes find hops a bit overpowering). The first taste needs to be taken slowly. The hoppy bitterness literally rolls back along your tongue from front to back. You can actually feel it move. It has a quick finish with a light bitter linger. However, there wasn't much else to it besides the bitterness in terms of flavor. For a bitter beer, though, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't exceptional. 3.5% ABV"
Magic Hat E Squared;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Real damn good. As hoppy as Blind Faith, but with added malt. Big body, bitter, bold, beefy. I''d love to see this make it to bottles.

Bitter End Lip Burner Lamb-Beak;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Lip burner name made me wonder, but it sure had me puckered up and answered the question immediately. Intense and sour and delightful all in a glorious way. Would that a barrel of this be unearthed.
Bitter End Lip Burner Lamb-Beak;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;[At GABF 2004] A hazy red-brown beer with no head. The aroma is of cherries and wood. The flavor is nicely sour with notes wood, that gives it a dry end. The sourness draws the mouthwater, just as a lambic should. Nice.
Bitter End Lip Burner Lamb-Beak;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Cloudy ruby red with great head and lacing. Nose of vinegar and tabasoish pepper. Big barnyard notes in aroma and flavor. Winey flavor with cherry notes also come out and a dry finish.
Bitter End Lip Burner Lamb-Beak;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Dry,sour,earthy,champagne like.One of the better american made lambics I've tried.
Bitter End Lip Burner Lamb-Beak;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;They made this out to be a grape lambic....interesting. Thin head, champagne colored. Aroma was of yeasty grapes....taste had a bitter fruitiness to it, not typical of lambics I have had in the past. Note: At the restaurant this beer is known as Mustang Lambic...apparently, it was marketed as the Lipburner at the GABF
Bitter End Lip Burner Lamb-Beak;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;If you like lamb-beaks, then you'll love this. I would never guess that it came from the good ole US of A. Very authentic, I want more!
Bitter End Lip Burner Lamb-Beak;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;GABF 2002: Tart winey funky aroma. Very tannic. Very sour. Whoooo! Authentic lambic flavors.
Bitter End Lip Burner Lamb-Beak;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;This is almost indistinguishable from Lindeman's Gueuze, and has a hint of their Cuvee Rene and a touch of Vigneronne (Cantillon), though not as tart. A terrific lambic! Never have I seen an american brewery tackle the lambic style - and these guys have executed so very well. Hats off to them. This is a tasty, tart, puckerin g treat you shouldn't be afraid to sample.
Bitter End Lip Burner Lamb-Beak;Austin, Texas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Re-rate: Wow!! I take back everything I said before - to my new lambic-loving palate, this ROCKS! Richly thick, sour but not maulingly so. The grapes make themselves known in a winelike way. Dry finish, exactly like it should be. Perfect with red-meat type dishes. My chick, Tina, had a sip of this and made such a contorted and ugly face that it made me wonder for a half-second if Asian women actually aren't unconditionally cute and wonderful...yeah, they still are. Original rating 10/3/02: 5-4-5-3-10: I hate when I rate things almost exactly like my brother did, without even looking at his ratings. Served in a white wine glass, clear and champagne-ish. Very dry, left my throat almost parched. The smell brought me back to childhood, dyeing easter eggs with Mom and Dad. The vinegar was pretty strong along with some grape flavor. I can still sort of feel it on my palate, 12 hours later. Interesting.

Lost Abbey Cuvee de Tomme;San Marcos, California, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Port Brewing Company / The Lost Abbey;Poured from a 375 ml bottle from what I believe is 2014. Aroma is a balanced blend of dark fruits and malt notes. Rich, dark caramel and toffee with lighter chocolate and toast notes. Loads of cherry, plum, raisin and prunes. Light alcohol notes and faint bourbon and oak. Pours brown with a small, thin, tan head that recedes quickly and disappears. No lacing and small legs.

Medium caramel and toffee notes with lighter chocolate and toast. Light oak and bourbon with a bit of alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium low carbonation. Low, but present astringency and low, but present alcohol warmth. Overall, an alright beer but these higher abv dark sours aren't really my thing.

Dark Horse One Oatmeal Stout;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Black. Brown head, two fingers, good retention. Oily texture, no fizz. Aroma is basic roasted malts, black chocolate, hints of distant coffeee, hints of nuts and hazelnuts, hints of burnt malts. Taste is the same. Soft sweetness. Hint of acidity. Roasted bitterness at the finish, almost medium. Alcohol is well integrated. This is a bit common and boring, to be honest.

Dark Horse One Oatmeal Stout;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Tall, stiff, dark tan, frozen looking spray insulation head on a pitchy pour. Standard longneck, bad, artsy label. Inviting roasted aroma, but the yeast really comes through to me and there's a creamy/savory/nutty undertone. Roasted, clean, solid. Not hugely hopped. There were a couple of off aroma notes from the foam - very minor. Great, velvety mouthfeel. Long roasty aftertaste. Pretty dang good pint. ABC Liquors, Bull Run.
Dark Horse One Oatmeal Stout;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Nice chocolate coffee aroma. No head. Nice full body, silky smooth mouth feel. Coffee flavor a bit too much for my taste but an excellent beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Dark Horse One Oatmeal Stout;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Dark Horse Brewing Company;A combination of a beautiful pour to a frothy, dark brown head, and then that head slowly dissipates. Aroma is milky chocolate, licorice and dark chocolate as it warms. Medium weight body is mostly sweet flavors but distance hints of bitterness, too. Bottle date is smudged and all I can make out is the vintage (2014) -- it's waited patiently for four years to be consumed. The bottle identifies this older version at 7.0% ABV vs. the currently listed 8.0% on this website. Delicious.

Kraftbrau Belgian Style Blonde Trippel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Kraftbrau Brewery;"tap at the brewpub - The beer menu just said ""blonde belgian"" for this one, so I’m going to guess that this entry is it. This ale has a good yeast and citrus aroma. Citrus notes abound in this sweet brew. Medium bodied and lively, it has a clean finish. It’s simple for the style, but not bad."
Kraftbrau Belgian Style Blonde Trippel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Kraftbrau Brewery;"medium brown appearance...aroma is full of spices and light fruit notes; smooth palate; flavor is also mildly spices with some hints of cherries and other fruits"
Kraftbrau Belgian Style Blonde Trippel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Kraftbrau Brewery;Slightly hazy golden body, medium off-white head. Bready aroma with toffee, caramel, toast, and earthy yeast, kind of like their Oktoberfest. Flavor begins with sweet, musty fermented fruit, quickly moving to wet crackers, big breads and caramels, toast, and a touch of pepper. Less emphasis on vinous notes and sharp fruit than most Tripels, but the layered breads and caramels play nicely off the pepper. A much, much better offering than the putrid Bird in the Hand. This was obviously aged, and I didn’t notice much, if any, alcohol presence.
Kraftbrau Belgian Style Blonde Trippel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Kraftbrau Brewery;After uncorking the 750ml green bottle it pours a bright but beclouded orange with the head statuesque and the texture spumous, the color a winsome light tan and as it evanesces the lace forms a tight skirt to hide the glass from view. Nose is sweet, with a nice hint of raisins and a bit of yeast, quite crisp, lemon like is a good description with the start ambrosial, nice malt profile, the top is fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish as an authoritarian acidic bite with the hops personable and spicy which carries to the very dry and slightly alcohol bitter aftertaste, a nice tummy warming from the 9.5 percent ABV, quite a nice brew tis true.
Kraftbrau Belgian Style Blonde Trippel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Kraftbrau Brewery;Fresh, zingy aroma not quite met by its sweet, syrupy, and very winey flavor. But you know, it's still a quality trippel, and a pleasure to drink...in a leisurely way on a summer evening (or winter night for that matter)!
Kraftbrau Belgian Style Blonde Trippel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Kraftbrau Brewery;Great German hop aroma, but not followed through in the flavor. Far too sweet (and JoeM500 is right about the corniness), super full bodied and a huge alcohol resence make this a sipper. Still, it gains in comparison to the beers I had immediately across town at the Mystic!
Kraftbrau Belgian Style Blonde Trippel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Kraftbrau Brewery;RBSG2003 (extended) (On tap at the brewery) Deep, murky golden brew. White, creamy head with good lacing. The nose is spicy and rich with candy sugar, malt and citrus fruit. Very malty flavor with loads of candy sugar up front. Tart hops and clover honey and yeast on the backside. Full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and light carbonation. Medium-length, semi-sweet, tart finish. Grassy at the wee end. A good tripel, but not quite balanced enough for my palate. I will always applaud American attempts at tough styles.
Kraftbrau Belgian Style Blonde Trippel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Kraftbrau Brewery;I liked this better than their Bird in the Hand ale. The alcohol is much more present, and there are some dull fruit tones - bananna mostly.
Kraftbrau Belgian Style Blonde Trippel;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Kraftbrau Brewery;Dark brown in color. Sweet corn aroma with alcohol in the nose as well. Some whisky notes on the palate, but mostly alcohol burn, almost corn syrup taste. Not too complex, but a dry end makes it drinkable. Big alcohol in this one.
Kraftbrau Summer Moon Organic Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kraftbrau Brewery;Clear yellow. Some spice in the nose. Small head. Really light. Some malt textures, but nothing really pronounced. Clean and light overall.
Kraftbrau Summer Moon Organic Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kraftbrau Brewery;Decent nose, grassy hops and some caramel notes. The tastes are a bit subdued and you almost have to concentrate to find them. Once you do, they are nicely balanced with a good, yet light, hoppy end.
Kraftbrau Robbie OSoundmans Irish Style Stout;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Kraftbrau Brewery;Deep roasted flavors. Dark brew with small head. Better stout than most. As it warmed the roasted flavors really come out.
Kraftbrau Robbie OSoundmans Irish Style Stout;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Kraftbrau Brewery;Nice Guinness clone. Great looking in the glass. Very dry and roasty. A great friend to the palate after subjecting it to some of the more dubious of this brewers offerings. I'd rate it next to most Guinness clones, a decent, smooth, rich, dry stout.

Coachs Downtown Brown;Norman, Oklahoma, United States;Brown Ale;Coachs Brewery;Pours a medium brown with a thin white head and light lacing. Aroma is sweet, with hints of toffee, sweet fruit and caramel malt. Flavor was not great, but respectable with chocolate and coffee malt overtones.

Coachs Downtown Brown;Norman, Oklahoma, United States;Brown Ale;Coachs Brewery;Good grief, this was bad along with a bartender who was wasted and completely abnoxious. Usual brown color appearance, nothing to rewrite in that regard. The aroma was chocolate, very faint roasted notes. The flavor was oddly fruity chocolate with very faint nuts. The fruitiness began to drive me nuts as it became raspberry tasting after a few sips. I was convinced they had turned this into something like Lost Coast’s Raspberry Brown, yet this thing was way underattenuated and astringent. Not a good production.
Coachs Downtown Brown;Norman, Oklahoma, United States;Brown Ale;Coachs Brewery;On tap at Coachs: poured brown with a small off white head more due to the bartender than the beer itself. Moderate malt aroma. Little hops. Flavor is mostly malt with a slight bits of hops. Decent.
Coachs Downtown Brown;Norman, Oklahoma, United States;Brown Ale;Coachs Brewery;The body is a light chestnut and it has an off-white ring in lieu of a head. The aroma is pretty sweet, a blend of caramel and toffee. Some toast is added to the flavor as well as an earthy, floral bitterness that keeps your teeth from rotting. There’s a slight touch of sourness in the taste that prevents this from being a much better beer. Coach’s Restaurant & Brewery, Oklahoma City, OK

Aroma is malty and sweet, touches of dark fruits. A medium bodied Belgian double. Malts are fruity and sweet, toffee and chocolate. Hops are slightly spicy. Very smooth.

Happy Valley Mission Ale Double;Somerset, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Happy Valley Brewing Company (CA);This was a slightly flat example of the brew, brought to me by friends from up north in a growler. Poured dark brown, almost opaque with hints of garnet when held to the light. No head to speak of but I’m assured that a fresher version of the brew produces a nice creamy off-white head. Aroma is sweet, malty, molasses and dark dried fruits. Flavor is also fruity, somewhat spicy with a bitter finish. Medium body and no carbonation. I look forward to re-rating this from a fresh pour!

Kona Black Sand Porter;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;Porter;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Much drier that the Pipeline Porter. Plenty of roasted malts provide an ashy flavor and a dry finish. Needs a little sweetness for balance.
Burgdorfer Wiesnbier;Burgdorf, Switzerland;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Burgdorfer Gasthausbrauerei;"2003-10-26, 7-4-7-4-15 Quite nice hop aroma, rather sweet & malty, with a good hopping. 2002-11-10, 7-4-8-5-14 Hazy blond color.

Far West Shegal;Redmond, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Far West Brewing Company;GABF 2002: Pale amber color. Oregano like aromas. Zesty, spicy and herbal flavors. Very different and unique. Bitter herbal finish is a bit off. Almost like eating dried herbs out of the spice rack.
Great Bear Pioneer Peak Porter;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Porter;Great Bear Brewing Company;20-Jan-08 (Draft: Great Bear Brewing Co. in Wasilla, AK) This porter has apparently undergone a recipe change lately as it’s pretty hearty. Very toasty, rich milk chocolate, loads of coffee, it’s lightly sweet and medium in bitterness with a moderately roasty finish. Medium-full body from start to finish and medium in carbonation. Light tartness and roasty bitterness balance the mouthfeel and keep the palate from becoming stale. Very toasty nose with lightly sour chocolate and mild coffee aromas. Just a shade lighter than black, this beer is even opaque at the edges. Half an inch of dark-tan head holds a thin layer and leaves patchy lace on the glass. Almost as impressive as Pioneer Peak itself, Kai (did I spell that right?) has done a great job with this beer.
Great Bear Pioneer Peak Porter;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Porter;Great Bear Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a deep brown with amber highlights and a smaller tan head. Aroma of caramel, chocolate, some cofffee. Flavors of the same. Nothing too special here. Thin...
Great Bear Pioneer Peak Porter;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Porter;Great Bear Brewing Company;GABF 2004 - Sour, brown ale-like aroma of caramel, maple and vanilla. Thin body, typical porter but on the weak side... Flavor has a small vegetable component, with some tobacco as well.
Great Bear Pioneer Peak Porter;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Porter;Great Bear Brewing Company;Had on tap at the brewpub in Wasilla. Dark red to light brown appearance, but very thin with not much of a head. Faint, coffee and chocoalte aroam - but you hav to rtry hard. Some slight coffee noites with an underlying fruity sweetness. Slightly thin mouthfeel. Not the best Porter- but not bad for a brewpub.
Great Bear Pioneer Peak Porter;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Porter;Great Bear Brewing Company;On tap at the 2003 Great Alaska Beer and Barley Wine Festival. Deep Garnet color aound the edges with nice beige head and an almost smokey roast nose. Dry, roast coffee flavor with nice hop bitterness in the finish. Good porter.
Great Bear Pioneer Peak Porter;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Porter;Great Bear Brewing Company;On tap GABF '02: BIg roasted aroma, full creamy mouthfeel, black ruby color with a good head, starts sweet, ends a little bitter and an aftertaste that never goes away.
Great Bear Archangel Amber;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Great Bear Brewing Company;Pretty decent little quaffer, slightly on the thin side, but overall pretty drinkable. Mild mouthfeel, with a creamy texture, a bit of chewiness in the grainy malt structure. Just a typical amber ale to me.Does not really have any of the textbook characteristics of a Scottish ale.
Great Bear Archangel Amber;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Great Bear Brewing Company;(Draft: Great Bear Brewing Co. in Wasilla, AK) Light, caramely nose is pleasant but only mildly aromatic. Likewise, the flavor is also caramely and moderately sweet, with a gentle roast and mildly bitter hoppiness. Medium body, about what I expect from an amber. Nice, deep amber color with an off-white head that settles to a patchy sheen but leaves plenty of lacing on the glass.
Great Bear Archangel Amber;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Great Bear Brewing Company;Had on tap at the brewpub in Wasilla, Ak. Dark orange appearance, slightly malty aroma with a touch of raisins. Flavor is somewhat muted for a Scottish Ale - detect some faint dates and molasses. Mouthfeel is very thin.
Great Bear Archangel Amber;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Great Bear Brewing Company;GABF 2002: Candyish aroma. Dark amber color. Rich malty and sweetish, with toffeeish notes. A good scottish ale.
Great Bear Hatcher Pass Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Great Bear Brewing Company;(Draft: Great Bear Brewing Co. in Wasilla, AK) Not a whole lot of maltiness in this pale ale, but lots of bitter grapefruit hoppiness in the nose and flavor, so the beer is somewhat unbalanced. That’s okay, it’s just a really hoppy pale ale, something I’m quite used to living on the west coast. Medium body, clean and crisp on the palate. Fully clear light amber body is topped by a small off-white head and rapidly dissipates to nothing. Pretty good, but I’d like more malt in this.
Great Bear Hatcher Pass Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Great Bear Brewing Company;On draft at the brewpub 7/14/05: Same muddy orange as their IPA but with little head and little aroma. Flavor is hoppy but comes across soapy instead of appetizing. After the IPA, it fell flat (literally).
Great Bear Hatcher Pass Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Great Bear Brewing Company;"Had on tap at the brewpub in Wasilla. Has a murky orange appearance with a decent sized head. Slight floral aroma. Flavor has some light citrusy notes but is a little ""off"" in some regards. Not altogether bad, just not up to par with the rest of Great Bear’s other offerings."
Great Bear Hatcher Pass Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Great Bear Brewing Company;Passing through Wasilla, I only had time to stop off at Great Bear to pick up a growler. Glad I chose this one. Murky amber in appearance. Crisp and clean mouthfeel. Nice malts ... fruity and yeast-accented, with earthy notes of cookie dough. Hops were really nice, too ... grassy and flowery, with a decent amount of bitterness to finish things off. Really enjoyable beer, and I easily finished off the growler without a problem.
Great Bear Skwentna Stout;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Stout;Great Bear Brewing Company;"(Draft: Great Bear Brewing Co. in Wasilla, AK) The flavor is light and less roasty than most stouts. It’s more like a sweet stout, sweet and caramely, moderately roasty, lightly bitter. This is echoed in the nose with the sweet, caramely aroma and light roast behind it. Medium ""plus"" body is a bit thin for the style, but certainly not watery. Ruddy, dark brown color, translucent at the edges. Small tan head fades to a rim. Pretty nice stout, but it’s a style of stout that I tend to like."
Great Bear Skwentna Stout;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Stout;Great Bear Brewing Company;On draft at the brewpub 7/14/05: Perfect-looking beer ... pitch black with a nice cascading tan topper. This starts woody but settles more into a cooked sugar consistency that ruined the view.
Great Bear Skwentna Stout;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Stout;Great Bear Brewing Company;Had on tap at the brewpub in Wasilla, Ak. Dark red fading to black appearance with a decent mocha colored head. Aroma has some burnt coffee notes and a bit of chocolate. Notice hints of bittersweet chocolate and coffee in the flavor. Good, creamy mouthfeel. Above average stout for a small brewpub.
Great Bear Skwentna Stout;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Stout;Great Bear Brewing Company;GABF 2002: V. dark chocolate brown color. Citric hoppy aroma with some roastiness. Citric hop flavors and a dry roasty finish. Interesting.
Saison De Brooklyn;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Interesting that it is still possible to find the 2001 reserve saison, and that a saison (a beer for the season, not to be stored) is still drinking so well 8 years later. Lovely hazy appearance and great lacing. A little spiciness, cloves and pepper, mostly just bone dry now.
Saison De Brooklyn;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);"Nice crisp golden coloured body with a bit of haze and a nice white head. Aroma of fresh grass, a good malt and subtle yet refined hops. Medium-bodied; Strong assertive malt up front with the grassy and yeastie feel of a saison. Aftertaste shows some complexity - white sugar and apricots come out as well. Overall, a decent beer, not amazing - but definitely worth trying! I sampled this beer on draught at Rustico in Alexandria, Virginia on 15-January-2009."
Saison De Brooklyn;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Draft at BT. Pours a pale yellow hazy body. Sweet fruit aroma with a spoiled fruit flavor, bubble gum banana, light citrus and a dry finish. Not crazy about this.
Saison De Brooklyn;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Draught @ BTAH. ’05 vintage. Pours a pale yellow, cloudy, with a white head. Aroma is mellow, banana, spicy yeast,a bit of clove, citrus. Taste is light, crisp wheat body, bit of banana, with a dryness from the yeast. Mouthfeel is fluffy, light bodied. Really an interesting beer to try after aging. Certainly a nice beer, but I found it to be much closer to a with than to a saison at this point. Still, delicious nonetheless.
Saison De Brooklyn;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);2001 vintage. Pale straw/yellow colour, very thick and persistent white head. Good looking beer. Aroma is great with loads of apricot fruitiness and a clove/coriander spiciness. A bit of fresh wheatiness, soft spice and a hint of black pepper. Banana/clove and a bright lemony citrus. Some lovely juiciness with tropical fruit (pineapple and papaya). A bit sweeter than I’d prefer, but that’s a bit of quibbling given all the good stuff going on in here. A very bright and expressive yeast was used with lovely juicy results. Drinking very well at six years old.
Saison De Brooklyn;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);"Tap at Blind Tiger: 2001 Vintage sampled October 2007: (Garret Oliver attended and made a heart warming speech about brewing as well) Poured a cloudy light golden/yellowish with a white frothy head that lasted. Bright bouquet of lemon-peel, coriander, and peppery citrus like spices. Fizzy mouth feel. Grainy flavors upfront with a mild wheat tart sharpness and mild hints of oxidation. The citrus flavors are dominated by a subdued lemon character. Finish leans toward grassy, and has a subtle lemon-rind bitterness. Not very complex, but better than expected. Held up somewhat well for these 6+ years; especially the hop character. I wish I was around to try the 2001 batch fresh."
Saison De Brooklyn;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);draft @ Coles Buffalo NY. Found some old notes cleaning up the desk. Clean, crissp, citrus, medium spiciness. Overall pretty good saison
Saison De Brooklyn;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);On tap at Blind Tiger, 2005 keg sampled in 2007. Peppery and phenolic nose, slightly floral, lacking in much character. Big bubble gum in the flavor, olives, and some other unusual notes for a saison. Really, this beer tasted more like some weird hefe/tripel hybrid than a saison. Not great.
Saison De Brooklyn;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);(draft @ The Old Toad - Rochester, NY) Pale and cloudy yellow color with a lot of white foam. Aroma is very fruity and spicy with lots of orange, banana, and clove. Flavor is very spicy as well with a lot of yeast and cloves at the front and a spicy and fruity middle. Decent amount of citrus and a dry finish.
Saison De Brooklyn;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);On tap. Hazy yellow in colour withg a small white head. Flavour and aroma of fruits, citrus, hops and malts. Refreshing and kinda sweet.
Americas Hemp Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Americas Brewpub;Poured from one of their growlers, day after purchasing. Poured a rusty color with very little head, beer was clear. A unique faintly smokey, salty sweet aroma. The taste too was different, somethign approaching smoke with a bitter body and a clean mild finish. A very dry, not intensely flavorful beer. Somewhat oily in the mouth. Interesting, but not exceptional.
Americas Hemp Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Americas Brewpub;Now this is different! The story behind how it was brewed is most interesting. This is another niche beer that one needs to sample. Nice color, nice malt taste, a little on the bitter side, but that’s OK. While I’m not a hemp ale person, this was still PDG (pretty darn good!)
Americas Hemp Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Americas Brewpub;An interesting drink, now called Hemp Stoned Ale because, besides the sterilized hemp seeds, they toss a 1000F granite rock into the mix. This all produces and oddly bitter aroma, somewhat nutty and grassy, somewhat mineral-like. Its haloed yellow/amber body neither adds to nor detracts from the brew. The flavor is a sweet malt that tastes like it was burned rather than roasted. Add to that some bitter almonds, some weeds, and a handful of dirty pebbles, and you have an idea what this tastes like. Not as good as it is interesting. A fun kind of a drink. America’s Brewpub, Aurora, IL
Americas Hemp Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Americas Brewpub;Mostly translucent gold with a thin foamy off-white head. Odd f’ing aroma that intrigues me - hair braids, hemp bracelets, sweaty shirts and bitter hops. Much creamier than expected. Part cream ale, part hippie. Ropes, crème de cocoa, evaporated milk, vanilla and dandelions. Carbonation is lacking and it’s a touch sweet, but points for originality.
Americas Hemp Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Americas Brewpub;served in tall pilsner glass. nice browinsh pale color. tastes maltiness at first with just enough balance at the finish also some nuttiness that the menu attributes to the hemp as well as some carmel. not very bitter. quite good. i definately recommend this one.
Americas Hemp Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Americas Brewpub;Had this on draught in Aurora, Illinois. Dissapointment might be the word I would use to describe it, if it weren't such a good beer, which it is. Thick head, pale golden color, effervescent. I detected nothing resembling marijuana in this beer.
Americas Hemp Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Americas Brewpub;Sampled at Great Taste of the Midwest '03. No aroma to speak of. No hemp or marijuana aroma at all. Yellow with white head. Not spectacular in appearance. Bland ale. Hints of apple or pear. There's nothing about this beer that suggests anything resembling hemp.
Americas Hemp Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Americas Brewpub;On tap, GABF 02: Hazy orange color, sweet/sour malt aroma, stale veggie note that I'm assuming is the hemp. I still haven't meet a hemp beer that I really liked.
Americas Hemp Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Americas Brewpub;GABF 2002: Light fruity aroma. Pale amber color. Very light and creamy, and well balanced. Med bitter finish, with a little caramel. Excellently done hemp ale.

Flossmoor Station Ashmans Abbaye Dubbel;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Dark garnet with a creamy white head and a few spots of lace. Fruity nose is slightly sweet and vinous. Medium bodied. A delicate balance of sweet fruity, earthy/citric hops and drying alcohol. A well-made dubbel.
Flossmoor Station Ashmans Abbaye Dubbel;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Smell is fruity with a trail-mix banana aroma dominating. Color is a good deep dark brown. Flavor is lacking and the overall effect is thin. My personal favorite in this style is New Belgium Abbey - try it if you haven't!
Flossmoor Station Ashmans Abbaye Dubbel;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Dark amber. Big banana nose, perfect aroma for an abbey. Mixed with a caramely syrup aroma... thinner than expected.
Flossmoor Station Ashmans Abbaye Dubbel;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;WOW, this dub packs a sugary, spicy punch to your tastebuds at first sip. It seems alive with just the right amount of carbonation and funky yeast. Tiny amounts of spice keep it from being too sappy or sugary and the alcohol (whatever it may be) masked. Hints of cherry or another berry flirted with me at the end of each glass. A wonderful afterdinner treat.
Flossmoor Station Ashmans Abbaye Dubbel;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;"On tap, 2003 vintage. Ah, if I am fortunate in one thing in life, it's that my work/home situation means I can hop off the commuter train at one of America's finest brewpubs on my ride home. I'm no Belgian expert, but this I do know: It's dark brown, with a thin, less carbonated mouthfeel like a session bitter. Nicely matly with roasty and coffee aspects, and a slight ""juicy fruit"" or cherry aspect.. It reminds me of a hearty porter or even a Russian Imperial Stout, under a thin, lacy Belgian head. Finishes just yummy, too! Take the Metra Electric from Michigan Avenue to beer bliss!"
Flossmoor Station Ashmans Abbaye Dubbel;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;This is very much a Belgian beer. Full of flavor that might overpower some people but I must say that I liked the complex flavor.
Flossmoor Station Ashmans Abbaye Dubbel;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap GABF '02: Aroma is sweet dark fruity Belgian yeast with touches of gingerbread. Clear orange/red color, full mouthfeel. The malt taste in this is exceptional. Won the gold and it deserves it.

Flossmoor Station Todds Tupelo Tripel;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Tripel;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Strange spices in the nose, not in a good way! Light and sweet, a bit bready.. like a liquid honeycombs cereal. Alcohol was a bit heavy. This beer left me shaking my head!
Flossmoor Station Todds Tupelo Tripel;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Tripel;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Sweet light and clean. Slightly bitter with a honey malted sweetness. Great balance between the honey and hops. Light flower notes.

Flossmoor Station Old Conundrum Barley Wine;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Notes from back when it came out in 2002. Heady dark color with bubbles along the rim. Smell of whiskey and coffee liqueur. Drinks very slowly, but very pleasurably. I recall this as the first of many strong beers from the Todd Ashman era at Flossmoor Station.
Flossmoor Station Old Conundrum Barley Wine;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Had this beer at GABF on 10/2/1999. Aroma is a sweet malt scent. Color is very dark near black. Light carbonation. Taste like most Barley Wines with a sweet rich malt flavor, some oak like flavors and a faint hop taste. Its a tasty Barley Wine.
Flossmoor Station Old Conundrum Barley Wine;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;GABF '02 Dark brown,little to no head.Bourbon and oak character,with a sweetness reminiscent to caramel.
Flossmoor Station Old Conundrum Barley Wine;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;RAF. A spicy, completely influenced by Jack Daniels brew. Huge soapy bubbles. Did they forget to completely empty the barrel? Caramel and coconut aroma, perhaps influenced by the addition of Palm Indian sugar. My bourbon-drinking uncle would ignorantly sing all beers' praises after trying this one.
Flossmoor Station Old Conundrum Barley Wine;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;cask (RAF) aged in Jack Daniels Barrel: a flat pour of dirty dish water with strange sparkling dust spots on top...aroma of whiskey, cream, smokey sweet carmel and oak..flavors were represented by a sweet and bitter combination with subtle oak notes and a nice throat warming...maybe some orange peel peeping in every-so-often.
Flossmoor Station Old Conundrum Barley Wine;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Strong toffee/rum/bourbon aroma. Bourbon and rum dominate the malt flavor, very little else is even tastable. WAY too harsh for such a weak barleywine. At times almost like a watered down shot of Jack Daniels. Slightly hoppy and very sugary. This one wasn't for me, could be the aging in bourbon barrels.
Flossmoor Station Old Conundrum Barley Wine;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;very different for a barleywine-huge malt, but not much hop presence. alcohol was well detected, but didn''t hinder the ratings much. Would like to try a larger sample of this.

Great Lakes Glockenspiel Weizenbock;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Draft sample during OBW. The beer is a hazed copper color with a white head of foam. Strong fruit and bread character with a big spice profile. Lots of clove and coriander. Big body and medium carbonation.
Great Lakes Glockenspiel Weizenbock;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);The body has a deep old copper/amber color. It is very hazy and it produces a small creamy, light tan colored head on top. The head slowly fades down to a thin ring of foam that makes a little slice lacing on the glass. Its aroma has big full nose of fruity and bready yeast with notes of banana, clove, toffee and fruited liquor. To start with this beer has a nice mellow warmth throughout from its 8%abv. It has a big fruity yeast character and full bready malt with plenty of sweetness up front. It has notes of ripe banana, golden raison, sour cherry and just a hint of toffee, clove and leafy hops. The hops add some light bitterness to the back end. The finish is bone dry and the palate is very smooth with a solid medium to full body.
Great Lakes Glockenspiel Weizenbock;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Rated on 5-30-2009 at Fort Wayne, IN Gathering (Bottle) This beer pours a small head, hazy orange body, no lacing, and very little carbonation. The Aroma is banana, spicy and caramel. The Taste is semi-fruity, clove, spicy, and banana. The Palate is tingly and this beer is medium bodied. Overall, the clove and banana flavor dominate this beer and a bit too much. A tasty beer and a beer that I recommend trying.

Great Lakes Glockenspiel Weizenbock;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);12 oz bottle from my want list from Doodler!!! Nose is a mix of light butterscotch and banana with some cloves mixed in. Cloudy plum red with a very light beige head. Flavor is a toffeeish, fruity mix with a bit of alcohol.

Great Lakes Glockenspiel Weizenbock;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Pours an orange-like amber with a white head. Great tastes of bananas with a little doughy palette. Nice medium body. Terrific for its style. Probably my favorite Great Lakes beer to date.
Great Lakes Glockenspiel Weizenbock;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"12 ounce bottle into weizen glass, best by 11/28/09. Pours very hazy and cloudy reddish orange color with a small foamy 1 finger off white head with decent retention that reduces to a ring of lace pretty quickly. No glass lacing. Aromas of big caramel covered bananas, biscuit, molasses, light orange zest, spices, and a bit of alcohol to round it out. Some excellent aromas here, very inviting. Taste of big banana, caramel, pepper, biscuit, clove, and molasses. No bitterness on the finish; but there is some lingering notes of caramel, banana, bread, molasses, and spices on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel that drinks easily. No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent and delicious Weizenbock at almost 2 years past freshness date. I wonder if they will ever bottle it again."
Great Lakes Glockenspiel Weizenbock;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);12oz bottle. Hazy golden in color with a small white head. Typical wheaty aroma, good intensity, with orange and banana. The flavor has wheat, sweet malt, orange peel, banana, and spices. Medium-bodied with average carbonation. A pretty nice weizenbock - definitely on the upper end of the style.
Great Lakes Glockenspiel Weizenbock;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"$3.30 single bottle from Binny’s ""best by"" Nov ’09. Hey, I figured this could lay down for a while. This pours a big malty smell and, I’ll admit, a bit of medicinal phenol from age. Deep brown in appearance, though not opaque or cloudy. Forget about sustaining any kind of head. But very malty and sticky. In a beer this aged, the weizen esters are long gone, leaving a plum impression, but then there’s a tiny bit of banana in the burp-back. A bit of sherry in there as well, but still pretty sweet. So this is yet a very good aged beer, worth holding onto until now."

Desert Edge All the Way Alt;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Desert Edge Brewery;Had this at the Trolley Square location. Received in a perfect pint look-alike. 4.5 A: Clear deep amber color. Came with one finger of creamy off-white head. Decent retention and a good sized ring of lacing. 3.5 S: Good amount of caramel and toffee. Toasty and grainy malts. Good, but could use a bit more power. 3.5 T: Big toastiness. Caramel and toffee to a lesser extent. Grainy. A bit more bitter than I prefer, but alright. Closer to an American brown ale than an alt, but whatever. 3.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. More crisp than creamy. 3.5 D: Good beer with a nice, big toastiness. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 06-23-2012 04:02:09

Dr Hops Maggies Dog Slobber Brown Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Brown Ale;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);A muddy brown color with a med off-white colored head. This has a weak, old coffee taste and lacks a sweetness to balance the bitterness.
Dr Hops Maggies Dog Slobber Brown Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Brown Ale;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);loads of chocolate up front, well not really loads but a bit and some really sweet carmel and a light nuttyness. The nose is very sweet overal, a little too sweet. Nice dark dull brown collor that is about the same color as the bottle, with a little bit of burgundy comming through. No head but a substantial lace coating on the glass. Hmm, a bit of carmel, mild hops, a little bit of roast and a lingering nuttyness raps it up. Pretty average body but a nice creamyness.
Dr Hops Maggies Dog Slobber Brown Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Brown Ale;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);NABA BeerFest 03: This is actually a blond, but I'll rate it anyways. This had way too much hops for a blond though, it was overlysweet and felt like they outbrewed the small malt body.
Dr Hops Maggies Dog Slobber Brown Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Brown Ale;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);Maybe its me, but I've never been a huge fan of brown ales. This is no exception either. To me it tasted like slightly roasted malt with over carbinated water added. Nothing special but the name.

Kasparus Kerstvers;Nagele, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;Bottle. Brown color. Firewod, juniper and various spices in the intense aroma and flavor. An abundance of spices makes the beer totally out of balance and undrinkable. Drain pour!
Kasparus Kerstvers;Nagele, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;Draft @ PWBF’11: Off white to light brown foamy head on top of a deep dark brown colored beer.

Low carbo, mid body and soft mouthfeel.

Kasparus Kerstvers;Nagele, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;@ Winterbierfestival PRZH 2010, Gouda. Black colored brew. The aroma is something different, very strong juniper, medicinal. Flavor has got a strong juniper taste, iodine. At first it’s flavor is too strong, but it gets better after a while. Very unbalanced.
Kasparus Kerstvers;Nagele, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;"Dark amber/brown color; the head disappears quickly. Deep malt aroma, spreading in the whole room, typical of barley wines; fruity. Less sweet than other barley wines of the same strength (actually, it's almost unique its balance of swetness and dryness), not the perfect score just because too much mono-dimensional: soft caramel. The hop used is the minimum necessary for such beer; some more would be an improvement. Easier to drink than other similar ones, but not persistent flavors."

Empire Berliner Weisse;Syracuse, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Empire Brewing Company;From 2002: When they brewed this a few years ago, it was the first time I’d ever tried the style and I did not like it. The brewers had me try some without either syrup, though I was just getting into beers and had no idea what to expect. Very pale yellow, sour, acidic, very light body. Wish they were still around so I could try more today with more beer experience under my belt.
Empire Berliner Weisse;Syracuse, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Empire Brewing Company;"Waiter ""Can I get you some drinks"" Me ""I'll have the berlinner weisse please with pistachio syrup"" Waiter: ""Are you sure you want syrup in it? It is extremely sweet with that in it, usually we just put syrup in it for girls."" Me: ""No no, I want syrup. I'm really in to beer, I can handle it"" Waiter's thoughts after I left the beer half unfinished ""Ya . . .you sure do know beer. Idiot."" Well that was along time ago, back when I had a few good beers and thought that that made me the authority on good beer. Fortunately now I am more humble and realize how little I know."
Empire Berliner Weisse;Syracuse, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Empire Brewing Company;Aroma of sour milk -- what was the source of their Lactobacillus culture? Not sour like others in this style. I sampled without syrup, so I could evaluate the beer. Nice try, but please get rid of the sour milk smell!
Empire Berliner Weisse;Syracuse, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Empire Brewing Company;"Sampled at the Syracuse location. Extremely pale, no head; faint nose; lightly acidic palate - celery, honeydew melon; very light body, lacking complexity so it comes off like a really lousy beer with aspirations to bigger things. In that regard it''s a let down, but with this style I''m getting the impression that it is a fine line."
Empire Berliner Weisse;Syracuse, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Empire Brewing Company;Light yellow appearance. Lightly tart body, dry and spritzy. A less than stellar example, but an unexpected treat nonetheless.
Vine Park Harveys Hefeweizen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Vine Park Brewing Company;September 15, 2012 on tap at the Autumn Brew Review in Minneapolis. Cloudy yellow pour with big head. Banana and clove in aroma and taste was similar but tart.

Vine Park Harveys Hefeweizen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Vine Park Brewing Company;Tap. Light hazy yellow with minimal head. A wheat and coriander aroma. The flavor had some spice and orange. Dry. This was a pretty weak hefeweizen.
Vine Park Oktoberfest;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Vine Park Brewing Company;On draught during Autumn Brew Review 2008 in Minneapolis, MN. Pours a clear copper amber brew with a fast dissolving off-white head. Aroma of caramel malt, some floral hops and a touch of toffee. Taste is light to medium bodied, flavors of caramel malt, flowery hops and some apple. Finish is semi-sweet, a tad malty with a mild caramel aftertaste.
Vine Park Oktoberfest;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Vine Park Brewing Company;Autumn Brew Review 2008. On the assumption that this is at least close to the same recipe that jazz88 reviewed years ago... Copper color with a medium head. Light caramel malt aroma. Lots of caramel and grain flavor. Very, very light floral hop finish.
Vine Park Oktoberfest;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Vine Park Brewing Company;Tap. Red/orange color. The flavor was muted and had hardly any of the Oktoberfest kick. It was watery and not even malty. Some of the flavor comes through as it sits on the palate. There was a hint of fruit in the aroma.
Great Waters Old Bastard;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Great Waters Brewing;Pours a slightly hazed copper color with an inch of soft cream-colored foam. The head dies down to a thin cap and a ring. Good lacing throughout the glass. Malty and alcoholic aroma. The flavor has lots of brown sugar and a bit of biscuit malt. A light floral hop bitterness gives way to something of a lingering candi sugar finish and aftertaste. Sadly, this beer has lots of sweetness, but not much else. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated. All in all, this was a kinder gentler old bastard than I expected. Or wanted. Sugar sweetness and floral hopping do not a bastard make.
Great Waters Old Bastard;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Great Waters Brewing;On tap at the brewpub. Yellow-amber in color with a white head. Molasses aroma. Simply syrup in a glass. This is something of a barley-wine wannabe. Thick and delicious. Big mouthfeel. Yum!
Great Waters Old Bastard;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Great Waters Brewing;Copper body. Low n/a aroma. Medium IPA-ish mouthfeel. Hop finish, with quasi-Sucrets flavor beginning on swallow and restarting later. Slightly above-avg session beer.

Great Waters Old Bastard;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Great Waters Brewing;"Dark orange color with a medium head. Very faint aroma... oranges? Hmm... the taste is subdued to say the least. A little sweet malt hits up front with a little alcoholic warming on the finish, but it’s pretty tame. Not bad, but not ""Woah! Gimme More!"""
Great Waters Old Bastard;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Great Waters Brewing;Tawny brown color, fine, fluffy head, Aroma, nice and hoppy, a little roasty, but not couldn’t exuding much more than that. Taste: good fruit in the flavor, again, neat little hop appearance, fullish body, adequate finish, but after that we’re left searching, for it comes up short in so many other areas, compared to the best of even the average of this style. No complexity, not much flavor beyond the basic fruitiness, and little alcohol felt. With a name like this, you’re expecting a bad boy, something devilish,and wicked, but nothing of the sort occurs here at all. I may want to trek out here another time and try it again, but this sample was terribly underwhelming.
Great Waters Old Bastard;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Great Waters Brewing;Had on cask at Great Waters on 2/13/2004 after a Wild game. The beer was a brown amber with a creamy looking cask head. The aroma was of malt and hops. the flavor was sweet, hoppy, and a bit watery in the body. Overall, it was OK as it was a cask ESA, but not great.
Great Waters Old Bastard;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Great Waters Brewing;Dark brown. Hops and fruit in the flavor. Thick and heavy. Seems to be an ipa. no head. One of the better products at Great Waters.
Great Waters Old Bastard;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Great Waters Brewing;On Cask: Deep dark rusty brown with caramel brown highlights, the beautiful flowing foamy bubbles cascading up the glass building the dark cream colored head slowly to about an inch high of firm thick fluffy whipped cream. A 1/4 inch foamed head sits on top the entire glass down. Aroma is quite soft with slightly grainy maltyness with a small sweetness and roastyness, notes of chocolate malts and nuts. For a strong ale its not very strong, incerdaibly mild and mellow with a malty sweet tang, hops are mild and dark with a smokey lingering sweet oaky finish. A short lived experience with any flavors, nothing substantial or providing. Sort of thin but definately empty in the feel but picks up some as it goes with a light sweet and grainy texture. Mellow, easy, subtle, and drinkable, just low on the scale of any real outstanding qualities in nearly every aspect with the exception of the how beautiful the glass of this stuff is.
Great Waters Old Bastard;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Great Waters Brewing;Tap. This was my favorite beer of the night. I had it in the sampler and then ordered a pint. A rich dark brown color with a perfect full brown head. It was cask conditioned. It had a nutty and malty flavor.
Great Waters Normas Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Great Waters Brewing;Tap. Black color. A tint of liqueur in the flavor as well as some cherry. It had that English breakfast stout flavor.
Great Waters Capitol ESB;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Waters Brewing;On Cask: Super nice deep copper color with a inch high head of dark creamy puffy oatmeal, settles slow to a nice ring and lace in tiny rings and spots. Smell is dullish fruit salad, peach, melon, and grapes, with a slight note of fresh floral hops. Taste is quite mellow, slightly sweet malts and gringy hops that favors floral freshness and piney bitterness thats very subdued. Feel is a bit empty, thin start leading to medium-light body and a bit of a light grainy texture, weak finish for a ESB, no strong bitterness, slightly lingers of what it does offer. Another Great Waters brew that needs a pep.
Great Waters Capitol ESB;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Waters Brewing;Tap - Cask. A hazy amber color. A traditional ESB. Nothing special stood out and it lacked the beauty of the Martin's Bitter.
Elliott Bay El Niño Fall Fest;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;Awesome autumn maroon amber--majestic looking with a crisp head. This beer is like many fall brews/harvest ales in that it is not easily defined as a marzen's or any other style. The aroma is a light malty-hop with a cinnamony quality as well. Sharp (like cheese), off-key malt undertones shape the flavor.
Bullant Premium Mild;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Mild Ale;Inchant Brewing Company;A small but lasting head sat atop of this amber/reddy coloured ale. Malt and most noticeably yeast aromas. Light bitterness in the flavour made it drinkable but not pleasant also seemed to pick up some rhubarb?
Bullant Premium Mild;Guildford, Western Australia, Australia;Mild Ale;Inchant Brewing Company;Medium amber clear with a small, short lasting light beige head. Slightly odd yeasty caramel and roasted malt aroma that develops more of a floral nectar as it warms. Thin generic soft drink like texture and body. Light yeasty bitter hops and some sweet malt flavours especially as it warms. Seems to lack blending (Sweet and bitter a bit too distinct) and overall balance for such a light beer.

Thomas Hooker Octoberfest;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;DATE: September 30, 2018... OCCASION: football watching and soccer waiting... GLASSWARE: Man Skirt willibecker... this pours straight from the can an amber brown with almost no effervescence... its head is off-brown, thin, and creamy--could look a bit livelier... a strong, assertive caramel injects apple, a bit of cinnamon, and cracker--smells like the season... creamy, much livelier than its appearance, with a bite at the teeth and a bit smooth, almost thick, at the finish--medium-bodied and well-tempered at 5.8%... between the caramel and tea, this puckers with a sweetness that bathes in breadiness, thick and full-flavored... it has a hint of hops, but apple and pear round out the experience.. a pleasant find at Abe's Deli, and glad to have bought two... a solid Fest...
Thomas Hooker Octoberfest;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;12 oz bottle, 10/4/15. Aroma has caramel and toasted malts, some grassy and earthy hops, and a bit of spice. Tastes similar, slightly hopped up version of the style, as the malts get a little muted in the flavor. Drinks fine, though one could argue it leans a little too watery for the style. Not bad.

Würzburger for Oktoberfest;Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Würzburger Hofbräu (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Pretty standard German helles. Not too much differentiation than the traditional and not as heavy as i would like for something named oktoberfest.
Würzburger for Oktoberfest;Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Würzburger Hofbräu (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Draft sampler at RFD. Copper/gold with frothy offwhite head. Bittersweet malt and grains, light earth hops. OK.
Würzburger for Oktoberfest;Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Würzburger Hofbräu (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Aged bottle: not sure of the age but i’ll say this, it was made in West Germany... . Pours a tawny tan .. . caramel, light molasses, some oxidation, and sweet copper .. . has held up incredibly well, quite amazing really- and my sample was clearly a marzen, not a helles .. . . I said, Dammit, monster, you quit bugging my children, now. We work for our money in this house - we don’t just give money away!
Würzburger for Oktoberfest;Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Würzburger Hofbräu (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Could swear that the last time I had this (15 or 20 years ago so maybe my memory is not so hot on this) it was a traditoinal Okfest/Marzen red lager. Now it’s more like the HBHaus, blonde, sweet, and boring. An abomination. Served with a nice, white head and lots of lace. Head mostly fades to thin cover. Color is a nice medium yellow gold. Aroma is sweet malt. Flavors about the same. Body is ok but carbonation is scant. Finish is forgettable. Borrrrrrinnnnng....

Würzburger for Oktoberfest;Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Würzburger Hofbräu (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Tap at Ginger Man and the Half Pint. Pale golden beer, slightly hazy with a thick creamy white head. Very fresh pils malt aroma. Lightly minerally with a soft baked bread crust as well. Flavour is also very fresh with a prominent crackery maltiness and a light floral hoppiness toward the back. Minerally/flinty bitterness. Comes across more like a slightly hoppy helles and is much more in the German festbier style than the typical Marzen we see on this side of the pond. Really great balance and a very nice beer.
Würzburger for Oktoberfest;Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Würzburger Hofbräu (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Draft. Amber minor head, a lot of sweets and malts. Nothing super-special but a decent Marzen.
Würzburger for Oktoberfest;Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Würzburger Hofbräu (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Draft at a club in Niles, IL with Polish clientele, that seems to keep in rarely-distributed German beers along with the Okocim and Zwyviec. But server knew little about the beer, and I only had the blue checkerboard on the tap handle to tell it was supposed to be an Oktoberfest beer. Poured in a Maisel’s weiss glass, it sure appeared to be a weizen to me. And I see by the other ratings that this is indeed one of the sickly pale lagers now being passed off in Germany as Okto bier. So, a pale pils color with a short-lived white head. Clean beer with very little besides a lightl malt smell. A bit of hop sharpness, perhaps bigger than I’m thinking as there’s little malt to balance it. I kept thinking I had notes of lemon and weizen spices. Okay on draft.

Notes of tea, lemon citrus, caramel, sugars, earth, honey, and pine. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a smooth, sweet, bitter mouthfeel. Has held up pretty well.

LaConner Olde Curmudgeon;LaConner, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;LaConner Brewing Company;On tap t the brewpub. Unlike any barley wine I have had. I would normally expect a dark brew but this one poured red-amber. Red licorice and cotton-candy dominate the flavor, with darker fruit, vinous hops, light coco and caramel apple complementing. Flavor is like Christmas cake and warm apple-berry cider. Body is viscous with soft bubbles and a warming alcohol that is delayed in its appearance. Deadly drinkable, well-crafted and unique.

LaConner Olde Curmudgeon;LaConner, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;LaConner Brewing Company;Thank you so much After4ever/Tom for this fantastic beer. It’s a vintage 2001 and I had it January 2008. It’s very dark brown with a red hue. It has no head, just a little rim on the sides of the glass. The aroma has sweetness and notes of roasted malt, raisin, dark fruits, candy sugar, soft and sweet licorice and hints of chocolate - very complex! The mouthfeel is oily! The flavour has sweetness and is very complex. I find notes of roasted malt, dark fruit, plum, caramel, candy sugar, sweet licorice, hints of alcohol and chocolate.

LaConner Olde Curmudgeon;LaConner, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;LaConner Brewing Company;Pacific Northwest Vacation 2007... 8/18/2007: LaConner Olde Curmedgeon was by far the best of the LaConner beers that I sampled. Its appearance is murky golden amber in color with a creamy beige head and lasting crown. The aroma has a strong fruity quality with notes of fermenting apples and a bit of a dry wood-quality. The flavor is rich and malty with a nice fruity complexity. It is slightly sweet due to the presence of sugary caramel malt. There is a bit of alcohol noticeable through the nostrils, but it is pretty well hidden in the flavor. This beer is smooth and creamy with a milky texture and a medium-full to full body. Very, very tasty! Draught (9% ABV) at LaConner Brewing Company in LaConner, Washington. Rating #22 for this beer...

Walnut Brewery Schwarzhacker;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Walnut Brewery (Rock Bottom);A darker pour. Still light as expected. Just a bit more malts and body. It’s pretty nice.
Walnut Brewery Schwarzhacker;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Walnut Brewery (Rock Bottom);Clear black with a really faint aroma of toasty roasted black malts.

Walnut Brewery Schwarzhacker;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Walnut Brewery (Rock Bottom);On tap: a dark brown color that smells of chocolate roast. Tastes lighter than it looks but its somewhat sweet with good carbonation. Its looks a little bit like coca cola.
Walnut Brewery Schwarzhacker;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Walnut Brewery (Rock Bottom);Dark brown with a silken head. Light, rough roastiness in aroma. Flavors jumble off each other, with a slight nuttiness. More akin to a robust brown ale than a schwarzbier in flavor, but decent overall.
Walnut Brewery Schwarzhacker;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Walnut Brewery (Rock Bottom);Deep rich brown coloring. Nose is soft, with hints of chocolate, and roasted hazelnuts. Smooth, but bittersweet, and not really what I expected judging by the descriptors for the style. Slightly porterish to me

Town Hall Smokehouse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours a nice cloudy straw color, with maybe an inch of nearly white foam. Decent lace. Moderate smoke in the aroma, but seriously, you might have to look for it. The base beer is sweet and wheat. Good amount of clove and light to moderate smoke. Having said that, I find it smokier than last year’s. That is a good thing. Medium bodied, and quite smooth. The only thing that I didn’t like is that they served it with a *fricking* lemon wedge. No. No. No. No. No!!!! Not as good as the version that I tried at the GABF 2002.
Town Hall Smokehouse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Smoked hefeweizen? What? Medium hued and slightly dirty orange yellow cloudy body. Creamy white ring of head around the glass. Charcoal-hefeweizen aroma. Fizzy palate. Smokiness adds an unpleasant stale smokey component.
Town Hall Smokehouse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Cloudy light aroma. Wheat plus smoked fish aroma, has orangey notes as well. Slightly soapy, charcoaly flavor. Clove notes, too. OK.
Town Hall Smokehouse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Hazy Honey Coloring. Good Head. Fruit and Wheat Aroma. Tasted Like a Hefe With Decent Amounts of Citrus and Wheat. Also a smokey flavor imbedded throughout. I’m new to smoked beers, but don’t think I care for it. Definitly Distinctive and Worth Trying but not perhaps a Favored Beer.
Town Hall Smokehouse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours a very cloudy yellow with a medium head that melts away in a few minutes. Aroma is pretty standard for a hefe: wheat and citrus. It his kind of a dusty hint at first... the smoke? The taste is an odd mix. The wheat and lemon are definitely there, but the smoke seemed to take the form of Saaz hops from a pils. It wasn’t smoke so much as it was dust. Also has a kind of bitter and tart hit on the palate. There are quite a few things going on with this beer and I’m not sure how many of them are good. It’s interesting, but not near the top of my list.
Town Hall Smokehouse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"On my first stab at this unique and wonderful ale, I gulped too quick and totally missed the smoke character. ""What-a-weizen?"" Lesson learned, that concentration is key! A cloudy yellow color, with a tight, yet fluffy white collar of foam. Aroma, mellow and citric, not yet giving off the smoke factor. Down the lips, smoooth, yet tantalizingly tasty and hearty, too. Then the smoke effect becomes discernible, asserts itself and shines on the palate, slowly, but surely rising to prominence on the flavor profile. Curls up in the mouth, the teeth, the gums, gets all up in there. Goes down very smooth, with a full and invigorating flavor. Smoke is subtle, but lingers on the palate and never quite leaves. Not the first time I was surprised by a Town Hall brew, and destined to not be the last."
Town Hall Smokehouse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Clearly banana aroma, with some wheat. Murky, cloudy, milk-yellow. Small head. Doesnt' have the orange hue most hefe's have. A burst of flavor. Tart and carbonated with Belgian white notes. Pretty good overall, though overly carbonated. Good flavor and enjoyable.
Town Hall Smokehouse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Whitish shade of a cloudy yellow, very strange lookin' color, with a puffy white head that fades to a small skim and lots of thin patchy lace thats drippy. Smell has a great yeasty grab right of the bat with the smokey senses of smoked bacon and has a frothy easy malt backing and sweetish wheat with some banana and lemon notes and very light clove. Taste has lightly sour lemon-like tendencies, the smokey sense is there but in a subdued mix in with some of the airy light malts and wheat sweetness, some banana floats around, touch of clove and spice. Clean, fresh, slightly sharp, nearly full bodied with a wheaty light texture in its feel, quite lively and refreshing. One of my favorites that I kept going back for during the Autumn Brew Review to help beat the heat. Good stuff, very drinkable and easy going, soothing hefe.
Town Hall Smokehouse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Light brown, a little cloudy. Some citrus aroma. I couldn't find a smoked aroma or taste. Kind of thin, and not much taste.
Town Hall Smokehouse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;MABR-Wheaty smoky aroma with the flavor being much the same with a nice smoked after taste that doesn't get to harsh but is very light.This was a very good brew i just wished i lived in minneapolis again so i could enjoy more of this brewery's fine brews.
Town Hall Jesters Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Beer made with 50% whiskey. A good idea, and a nice try, but it tastes too much like whiskey and not enough like beer. No wonder I got so buzzed at the festival.
Mühlfelder Helles (-2015);Herrsching am Ammersee, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Mühlfelder Brauhaus;Draught at the brauhaus Cloudy blond color with compact head.

Mühlfelder Helles (-2015);Herrsching am Ammersee, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Mühlfelder Brauhaus;1l-bottle from the brewery. Clear, perhaps slightly hazy golden yellow, large white head. Grainy, malty flavours with some nice herbal-grassy hops. Good one.

Mühlfelder Helles (-2015);Herrsching am Ammersee, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Mühlfelder Brauhaus;Honneyish malt aroma. Cloudy yellow. Taste centers on sweet malt with flowery fresh hops on top. Relatively lightbodied and fresh.

Mühlfelder Weizen (-2015);Herrsching am Ammersee, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Mühlfelder Brauhaus;draft @ the brauhaus. Cloudy, dark and muddled. Aroma is strange sticky, flawed and sour with yeast, salt, and rotten mushrooms. Yuk, is weird, overly yeasty. I hope it’s off.

Loscher Premium Pils;Münchsteinach, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Loscher;Bottle from the brewery getränkemarkt. Clear gold with a short and large-bubbled white head. Simple pale malt aroma impression is crackers and toasted grain, there’s little in the way of aroma hops, and an unpleasant intrusion of DMS (metal, cement, vegetables) ruins it once it breathes for a short time. Light bodied, effervescent and carbonic but also watery and short in the mouth, lacking malt depth, lacking cleanliness and lacking hop expression. Basic industrial Pilsner.

Widmer Brothers Wit;Portland, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);On tap at the Portland spring beer fest 2007. I always wanted Widmer to bring out a wit beer to take on the growing demand for blue moon in this area. Not quite as spicey and fruity as blue moon, but more along the lines of lost coast great white. Lighter on the spices, with a wheat and yeasty flavor. This turned out more like a corriander spiced hefe, could have used a more estery yeast strain to give it more character.

Keeping Andrew at bay for one more tick (edit: nope). And what a tick - Barley Fuckin’ Browns. I love these guys. Clear burnt amber pour with white head, good lacing and retention. Nose is a classic west coast ipa done right - jammed full of resin and grapefruit, backed up with some caramel. Just enough sweetness to crushable, just enough alcohol for ""tomorrow guy"" to regret the first fact. Assertive bitterness so you know you’re drinking an IPA and not some hop-flavored juice.

Kronenbourg 1664 Fleur de Houblon;Obernai, France;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);The 1664 with some added hops and they do indeed make a difference. I am not all that well informed about this hop but it is a leasant one to taste. all te hallmarks of a well presented lager euro style with the benefit of the added hopkick.
Kronenbourg 1664 Fleur de Houblon;Obernai, France;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);Bottled. Pale golden, creamy head. Grassy aroma. Sweet and sugary with clean maltiness. Medium bodied and quite hoppy with a hop aromatic finish and just a trace of bitterness.
Kronenbourg 1664 Fleur de Houblon;Obernai, France;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);Pale gold colour. Supposedly made with fresh hop flowers, presumably to give it a little more zing than the normal 1664. Very slight hints of malt on the nose, but, although there is some hop character, it lacks the attack I would expect from a good helping of fresh hops. I'm not sure about the claims of Strisselsplat being one of the best hops i the world on the label. Perhaps there is a little more character than the standard 1664 product, but it is very subtle - still blond and bland. Bottled, France, December 2003.

Bitter End Octoberfest;Austin, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Some head and lacing. Strong tea color. Nicely sweet flavor with a touch of malt. A nice brew.
Bitter End Octoberfest;Austin, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Average clear-amber look, slightly smaller than average head. Crisp smell which went well with the cold front that was coming into Texas on that first cold night of the fall. The flavor is floral and fresh, with maybe a touch too much of mintiness and dare I say, a hint of whiskey (?) that made it feel like it had a high ABV for an octo. Malty finish that became slightly wheaty as the glass warmed up. With this creation, I think that Bitter End has brewed one of every style of beer known to man.
Bitter End Octoberfest;Austin, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Looked beautiful, decent white head, deep orange color. Once served the taste was crisp, with a menacing hint of cereal. It got better as it warmed with a more complex malt taste....I need to try this again to get a better idea of where it was going, it just seemed too average for an octo.
Aldaris Stiprais;Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Aldaris (Carlsberg);March 2010. Bottle. Poured straw yellow with a white head. Aromas of malt, yeast, corn and grass. The alcohol is showing too much for this to be an enjoyable beer.
Aldaris Stiprais;Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Aldaris (Carlsberg);"Pours a cloudy pale amber color. This head dissipates quickly to thin white film; moderate lacing. Aroma is light malt. Taste the same, with some booziness and a hint of sour raisins. Medium body, slick, soft carbonation, astringent finish. This beer isn’t as bad as the ratings would make you think. I probably wouldn’t have picked it up, if I had looked first. It’s okay. I’m not even going to dump it."
Aldaris Stiprais;Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Aldaris (Carlsberg);This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a medium sized head of foamy with a frothy top fine to medium sized white colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a typically carbonated hazy yellow orange colored body and a thick foamy lacing. The aroma was grassy and lagerish. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a biting hoppy aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of mildly vinous banana hops and malt. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
Aldaris Stiprais;Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Aldaris (Carlsberg);From a bottle poured a straw color with a small amount of head. Sweet grassy malty flavor with a quick finish.
Aldaris Stiprais;Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Aldaris (Carlsberg);golden amber with minimal head. sweet and corny, unpleasantly so. not a good beer whatsoever.
Aldaris Stiprais;Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Aldaris (Carlsberg);Bottle. Yuck. Pours a hazy yellow with almost no head. Aromas of sweet malts and alcohol. Flavors of sweet malts, corn, metal and alcohol. I was almost scared to finish the bottle after tasting it.
Aldaris Stiprais;Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Aldaris (Carlsberg);500ml bottle in a shaker. Pours light golden with a thick, off-white head. Aroma of bread and toasted malts with light floral hops. Flavor the same. Average texture. Nothing special here.
Aldaris Stiprais;Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Aldaris (Carlsberg);Bottle from Alko. Golden beer with white head. Alcohol and bready malts on the nose. A bit alcoholic taste is a bit sweet with decent maltyness which makes a good body. Not so bad, I expected less.
Aldaris Stiprais;Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Aldaris (Carlsberg);Tasted from a 500 mL bottle purchased in Littleton, Colorado. Pale Lager aroma. Somewhat hazy yellow/orange appearance with a white head. Strong Pale Lager flavor with pale malts and alcohol. Not all that easy to stomach.
Aldaris Stiprais;Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Aldaris (Carlsberg);Slightly hazy yellow, small ring of foam. Aromas of soapy hops, malt. Taste is sweet with little to balance it out. Somewhat nutty and carmel-like aromas come out, but don’t improve it much in the absence of roasted or hop flavors. Tastes like malt at least rather than cheap adjuncts, but doesn’t have a very good balance.
Davidson Brothers American Bright;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a semi-golden yellow color with a slim white cap of a head. Sly messy lace. The aroma has some toast, grassy hops and fruity dry hops to rub against a fair caramel/toffee malt. The flavor had a malty dry sweetness to it. Subtle quick dry sweet aftertaste. Finish seems barely there. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fairly easy going sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. Overall, is this an American pale ale or a blonde ale? Honestly, I kind of had a hard time trying to find much here at all.
Davidson Brothers American Bright;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;"Golden color, thin taste. Used it as a ""lite"" beer substitute at my wedding, and the lite beer drinkers really enjoyed. Not my preferred style."
Davidson Brothers American Bright;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Light golden in color with a small white head.Light fruity and hop aroma. Clean flavor,but very thin and lacking.
Davidson Brothers American Bright;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Light straw yellow with a thin white small bubbled head. Sharp earthy aroma, with some light yeast. fizzy and watery. Moldy aftertaste. Much better than BMC.
Davidson Brothers American Bright;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Decent head, however a diacetyl nose and mouth feel detected...slight floral notes in the mouth but doest cut through the defect...disappointing.
Davidson Brothers American Bright;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Very good beer. I didn't know what a bright ale was, so i didn't go into this beer looking for a particular style or flavor. I figured it was a hopped up golden ale or something. Pours clear and golden, with a moderate white head. Frothy. Aroma is slightly hoppy and light. Flavor is crisp and mildly hoppy. Very light body. Slight maltiness, but mostly a light style with mild flavor. Lively carbonation. Tasted awesome on the beach in late June. I'm going to go with a blond ale for the style.
Davidson Brothers American Bright;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Golden colour with a thin, large-bubbled white head. Smells of metal and sweet fruit are definately present. The taste is very very watery and slightly floral. This is definatly not an APA, and if it is in fact an ale, which I don't think it is, it's more of a blonde ale. Don't buy this one.
Davidson Brothers American Bright;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;An adequate, mild ale that's far from an APA. Hardly any hops at all! Likely this is a Blond Ale. Whatever it is, the floral notes are pleasant and I enjoyed it. Decent and fairly mild and sweet. Not a dry or crisp brew.
Davidson Brothers American Bright;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Clear, light golden. Nose of light cereal, light flowers but mostly smells like macro swill. Quickly dying head, macro flavor, lots of fillers, cereal flavors, hint of metal and lemon...APA my ass.
Davidson Brothers American Bright;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Davidson Brothers Restaurant and Brewery;Bright Clear color with little head or lace. Sweet well-balanced aroma. Bitter hoppy flavor, slightly flowery. soda like on the palate.

Harpers Oktoberfest;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Harpers Brewing Company;On tap at Harper’s. Light orange body, thin off-white head. Cerealy, dry body with grassy hops and hints of caramely sweetness. Rather insubstantial.
Harpers Oktoberfest;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Harpers Brewing Company;Clear dark copper body with minimal head. Aroma is malty, but not as caramelly as I expected. Just as I took a sip, I got a whiff of hearty toastiness. The flavor is strongly malty (caramel and toasty), but accented with healthy bitterness. Quite full bodied, especially for an Oktoberfest.
Kratochwill Temno;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Kratochwill;On tap at Kratchwill pub in Ljubljana. Dark color, small beige head. Medium body and carbonation. Taste is (too)sweet, strong flavour of coffee and cocoa, a hint of nuts. Surprisingly good, didn’t expect this.
Kratochwill Temno;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovarna Kratochwill;Almost black color, thin tan head that went away fast. Aroma of caramel, roasted malt, some chocolate and coffee notes. Taste is.. Wow... My first thought was - liquid peanutbutter. Caramel, some dark fruits notes, chocolate and coffee notes... But aftertaste is peanutbuttery and it stays that way for a long time. Nice creamy texture, soft carbonation. This took me by a complete surprise, simply awesome dark lager. -- rated with beerbasher/winphone

Aroma of caramel, coffee and scotch. Taste starts with sweet caramel malt, followed by strong coffee note and some roastiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, while aftertaste is very lightly bitter.

Malty aroma, some very mild notes of coffee. Taste starts with some coffee, a bit malty with some bitterness later on. Metallic aftertaste.

Kratochwill Mešano;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovarna Kratochwill;Draught at Kratochwill, Ljubljana. Cola brown with a thin light brown head. Not much going on - some light caramel malt tones, dusting of cocoa powder and a handful of hops at most. Thin mouthfeel. Short forgettable finish. A whatever beer.
Kratochwill Mešano;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovarna Kratochwill;01/08 @ Kratochwil pub in BTC, mix of their Svetlo and Temno. Sure, murky lighter brown with medium head. Aroma was rather different, ok, had some grassy hoppines from Svetlo, but some mysterious caramel as well. Bitterish flavor, malty with roasted sugar, and also a bit hoppy, which is specially felt in finish as slight sourness. To me, it’s leaving less watery impression than those two, but I like them more than this mix, as in most of such cases.
Kratochwill Mešano;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovarna Kratochwill;Beer no. 7 of my trip to Ljubljana, Slovenija. It poured a beautiful ruby red colour with a creamy white head that went away slowly. The nose was dusty malt. Yeah, this is the mix between their svetlo and tamno, but I’ve had exactly the opposite experience from ozujsko. This was watery. Characterless taste, like a tad more caramelly and a lot more watery version of the svijetlo. A disappointment. We asked the waiter how much alcohol these beers had and he wasn’t sure but he said that they were around 4.2%...
Kratochwill Mešano;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovarna Kratochwill;Sampled draught at Kratochwill, Ljubljana, Slovenia. - when you mix up two watery beers you must get some heavy beer, the best Kratochwill but there is much better home made beers
Adam Ravbar Kvasno Svetlo Pivo;Domžale, Slovenia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarna Adam Ravbar;Draft @ Pivo & Burger Fest Oct’16, Ljubljana. Dorée, col blanc crémeux. Nez noble présentant comme les autres evrsiosn, sa part de fautes au niveaud e la fermentation, retrouve un côté malté pils et une brève amertume. Palais est léger, un peu trop de levure qui denature l’effet attendu des houblons nobles. Le tout garde une approche correcte niveua malt pils.
Adam Ravbar Kvasno Svetlo Pivo;Domžale, Slovenia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarna Adam Ravbar;500ml Bottle (Thanks Omhper) - Golden with a haze and a white head. Lemon and some perfumed notes in the aroma. Zesty, tangy and refreshing taste with lemon, lime, honey and grain. A pils with plenty of character that combines tradition with some modern twists. A slight tartness can be detected in the finish and this might be down to the beer being unfiltered and not particularly fresh (Per got it a couple of months back) but it does not take away from the enjoyment, and perhaps even adds to it.
Adam Ravbar Kvasno Svetlo Pivo;Domžale, Slovenia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarna Adam Ravbar;Yellow colored, bit hazy, moderate strong creamy white head. Aroma is of grains, malt, cereal, some butter, straw. Taste is low sweet malt, cereal, grains - bread, buttery, straw and some noble hops, low bitterness. Low bodied, moderate carbonation.

Adam Ravbar Kvasno Svetlo Pivo;Domžale, Slovenia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarna Adam Ravbar;Bottle 2l at home. Nice malty and citrusy/herbaly hop aroma, slightly Weizen-ish. Taste is a bit boring, not much malt character, very unusual bitternes. Very nice head retention and just the right amount of CO2. For my taste way to watery and boring. I’m suspecting an off batch and i’ll try it again on tap at the pub.
Adam Ravbar Kvasno Svetlo Pivo;Domžale, Slovenia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarna Adam Ravbar;Cloudy dark golden lager with actual sediments in it. The smell is indeed a bit yeasty, but coming mostly bready which works quite well with the soft malts that display similar characteristics. Strawy, rather crisp, sweetish malts are tamed by a nicely slicing flowery bitterness. Strange with the yeast, but more than acceptable and one of the most pronounced hop bitterness in Slovenia I presume.
Adam Ravbar Kvasno Svetlo Pivo;Domžale, Slovenia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovarna Adam Ravbar;Hazy pale amber brew with an aroma of bubblegum and peardrops, almost like a wheat beer! The flavour is fairly malty and continues with the strange wheaty flavour. The finish is sweetish and short with some saaz-y perfumed hops. (sampled on draught in the brewpub)

Frog Island Croak & Stagger;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Frog Island Brewery;Tasted this at the Troon Beer Festival in October 2007. Cask, gravity dispense. Clear dark ruby red in colour with a thin white head. Vinous, port like aroma which is strong in intensity. Robust yet smooth creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Dark malt complex gives a sweet maltloaf base with rich roasted grain, roasted coffee, black plums, figs and treacle toffee. Spicy hops add a slight peppery note to the short bitter aftertaste. Malt returns to the smooth finish with rich plain chocolate, dry tiffin cake and walnuts. Slightly similair in style to Dent T’ Owd Tup. A superb English Strong Ale in style and long may they continue to thrive.
Frog Island Croak & Stagger;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Frog Island Brewery;Bottle (from the november 2005 RB-tasting at Dixens place - notes have been damaged by flooding of my basement, but this was such an insane tasting for me as I was new to such massive tastings, so I gave up on the detailed notes quite early).

Bready, doughy nose, a bit worty, with biscuits, light honey, and just a touch of citrus hops. Flavor is sweet, malty and simple, dough, orange, bread. Slick, rather full. A touch of orange and pepper in the finish, which is not all that bitter. Boring really.

Very light haze on a golden pour with a decent white head. Nose is lemon rinds, straw, grains, grassy. Taste comprises pale malts, bread dough, lemon drizzle, hint of vanilla, grains, straw.

Würth Windischeschenbacher Zoigl;Windischeschenbach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Würth;50cl bb06/2017, Edeka Tirschenreuth. - A gentrified, purified, filtered Keller of sorts, Würth capitalises on the Zoigl cult of the last 10 years by bottling this fair enough, hoppy Keller with a thin, bready malt base. Distinctly grassy and nettle-green, if fresh in aroma. Accents of sweet almond, barley husk sulphurs. Basic, if balanced in flavour,with a sweet yeasty touch. The best of the bottled Würth range, which is where real Eschawo Zoigl sets in and takes over...

Würth Windischeschenbacher Zoigl;Windischeschenbach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Würth;Terrible zoigl... definately too much hops for such a beer. Also too filtered. Not recommended.
Würth Windischeschenbacher Zoigl;Windischeschenbach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Würth;"Bottle best by Mar. 16, 2016: Golden in color with minimal haze. Creamy but nonuniform head. Clean but simple nose of minerals, lemon, hay, baguette and piecrust. Loose carbonation. Thinnish body. Initially toasty with fairly vibrant pils malt which distributes a profusion of baguette and hay notes underscored by deeper cookie accents. Malt takes on a grassy hay dimension which echoes the grassy hop aspects. Lemony splash of well-integrated hops ensues, though a noticeable waxiness as well as an intrusive slickness negates much of the hoppy brightness. Lemon, hay and vague toast encompass the basic but mostly clean finish. It’s nice to see that this brewery is actually trying rather than simply exploiting the word ""zoigl"" for monetary purposes, like so many other charlatans are doing with their fraudulent bottled product. No obvious off notes found here, but it certainly doesn’t possess the character that you’ll encounter in most of the stuff produced at the kommunbrauhauses, nor does it exhibit the depth of character found in their Dunkles Zoigl. Tastes more like Franconia than Oberpfalz, but it’s still an enjoyable lager."

Coopers Cave Radeau Red Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Amber pour with hints of yeast and hop. Sweet caramel malts and no strong charecteristics seem to be a re occuring theme with this brewery. They don’t make any horrible beers, but they don’t make anything outstanding either.
Coopers Cave Radeau Red Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Sampled from the tap at the brewpub. Poured a clear red with orange hue and a light brown head that dissipated slowly to the edges. Aroma was very sweet with caramel, sweet grains, butterscotch and chemicals.

Coopers Cave Radeau Red Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Coopers Cave Ale Company;"22 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy amber with a thin-moderate off-white head that lasted through the first two sips and left scant lace. Mild aroma of malt and not much else. The flavor is somewhat weak malt that is at the same time a bit harsh. Mild bitterness at the finish. Light-medium bodied. It frankly amazes me that this brewer is able to stay in business given the body of work I have consumed. At ""3"", this is the highest I have rated one of their beers and the only one that I have bothered to finish the bottle."
Coopers Cave Radeau Red Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Bomber. Pours reddish brown with a thin pinkish head. Smells of sweet malt and band aids. Tastes bitter and caramelly with lots of infectedness,
Coopers Cave Radeau Red Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Yeasty, spicey aroma, with the musk of old cellars. Dark copper color with a light head. Full flavor and good on the palate, but pretty nasty going down - taste of peat and dirty socks, with rough hops in the finish. A little local brew that appears to need some improvement. I would like to give them another try - the bottle I had may have been stale or contaminated.

Coopers Cave Bumppos Brown Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Color is leathery brown. This beer is lightly carbonated which produced a thin head. Scent is mild hops. There is a slight roasted character to the malts. Also picking up mild cocoa and mild oak. The aromas are not abundant and one in particular over the other but they are balanced. Taste is dusty. Tastes as if the beer has been mixed with dust swept up off the floor. The oak taste is as if burnt oak turned to ash was mixed into the wort. The aromas usually reflect taste but no hops are tasted. The palate is ashy oak, very watery, and slightly bitter. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Coopers Cave Bumppos Brown Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Pint from Cooper’s Cave. Pours a clear brown body with a minimal head, this brew is lightly carbonated with most of its flavors from the gritty, grassy notes of the hops with a slight tobacco note as well. On the watery side, but still quite tasty.

Coopers Cave Bumppos Brown Ale;Glens Falls, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Coopers Cave Ale Company;22 oz. bottle. Pours a clear reddish brown with a moderate off-white head that disappeared soon after the first sip. Trace aroma of chocolate and malt. Flavor was almost nonexistent except for a touch of malt and a barely noticable hops finish. As the beer warmed, the hops bitterness became more pronounced but the flavor remianed nearly hidden. Very thin, watery mouthfeel. I drank about half of this bottle and unfortunately poured the rest down the drain.

Tröegs HopBack Amber Ale;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tröegs Brewing Company;Hopback was decent, but, a little confusing for my taste. It seemed targeted to folks who might like Sierra's Celebration IPA, which is one of my favorites, but didn't end up hitting the mark. Aroma and taste was of a mild citrusy / bitter / hoppy top line running on a malty base line -- almost like you took a traditional IPA and an amber ale and just mixed them in the glass -- and you could tell that the two were not meant to go together. It was Ok, but just not for me.

I don’t know why they have this, and another Marzen they break out in the fall. The aroma is very malty, caramel, brown sugar, candy sugar. The appearance is an attractive amber (duh!), white head. The flavor follows the aroma, except maybe the flavor has a slight toasted malt thing I didn’t pick up in the aroma. The finish has a modest hop bittering. The mouthfell is straight down the middle medium. Decent beer overall. Their usual Marzen isn’t as sweet as this.
Black Forest Amber Marzen;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Forest Brew Haus;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a cloudy amber with a moderate off-white head that faded to a film at mid-glass and left a layer of foam with each sip. Weak aroma of malt and not too much else going on. The flavor is that same weak malt followed by a fiarly bitter hoppy finish. The bitterness lingers in the back of the throat briefly beyond the swallow. Very average beer.

Black Forest Weizen Bock;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Black Forest Brew Haus;Growler thanks to Hophead75. Pours a nice deep amber, bordering on brown with ruby highlights and a thin dissipating head. Aroma is on the spicy plasticy phenolic side with a spicy cinnamon character- all spice even. Some banana and just a ton of spicy raw clove spice and tons of green apple acetaldehyde. More green apple skin in the flavoor acetaldehyde, plastic and solvent all the way through the flavor hints of banana and fusel alochols and wierd out of control esters- some doughiness, and sharp astringnet carmael sweetness. Finsih is a bit slick and solventy with more apple juice character in the end. Meh.
Black Forest Weizen Bock;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Black Forest Brew Haus;Growler from the brewpub. Hazy amber/light brown in color with a small to medium off white head. Aroma: quite phenolic with alot clove, banana, green apple, bread, and some wheat and molasses. Taste is light banana and a touch of chocolate, with clove, molasses, and strong green apple- becomes tart with wheat and again green apple in the finish. Has alot of potential- the sweet and tart apple made this one difficult to drink though.
Black Forest Weizen Bock;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Black Forest Brew Haus;Tap at brewpub. Nice dirty looking opaque burgundy topped by a substantial tan head & lacing. Has a sweet, toffeeish malt aroma. Pretty creamy texture. There’s lots of underying banana sweetness, with a sharp tartness from the wheat malt. Hints of spice, but very mild. Roasty, peppery bready finish. Overall it’s somewhat simple, and the tartness was a bit too much for me. I enjoy the sour notes in Weizen Bocks, which give it the drinkability it should possess, but this one was too sour in my opinion. Other than that it has a decent profile.
Black Forest Weizen Bock;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Black Forest Brew Haus;"Tap at brewpub poured into a tal mug. Color is light brown with a small head, medium translucence but low clarity. Aroma is best described as the chalk board behind the bar say ""spicy & fruity."" Sweet granny smith apples, LOTS of CLOVE and sweet wheat (almost rye like). Taste is malty cereal sweet with and a slight sour sweetness (from the wheat). LIght-medium body with very little bitterness. Actually, in general it seems this is a blend of the recent Rye Doppelbock and the Scotch Ale."
Black Forest Weizen Bock;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Black Forest Brew Haus;On cask: LI Real Ale Fest - Very wheaty, slightly malty and slightly sweet. A hint of sour yeastiness, but not very unique.
Black Forest Weizen Bock;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Black Forest Brew Haus;"Cask at Long Island Real Ale Festival - my first reaction was ""yup, that’s a weizenbock,"" and my overall opinion didn’t really change after repeat sips - slight sourness, tempered by caramel malt and a bit of chocolate sweetness - nothing really stand out - I can think of half a dozen weizenbocks that taste exactly the same, and I’m not sure if that’s a compliment or an insult to the beer."

Black Forest Porter;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Porter;Black Forest Brew Haus;Black pour with a dense brown head. The aroma is cocoa, oatmeal, milk chocolate and brown sugar.

Black Forest Porter;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Porter;Black Forest Brew Haus;"Appearance: dark brown body, reddish at the bottom, and showing a thick lush cocoa-colored head. Nose is soft and creamy, slightly toasty, but stops there. A nutty flavor peeks out later on. On first sip, minimal hops, and thick, lush. rich roasty malt. Medium body, just-so texture, with a contiual, ringing nutty flavor. Sweet and tasty, with a mild fruity character interjected, and the end of the beer dominated by coffee aspects. Very well enjoyed, though I ashamedly admit confusion during consumption. This was reviewed from an unmarked growler, and I was fooled by the nut I tasted and thought it was either a rich brown ale or a mild stout, but I didn’t think ""porter."" Still, despite my befuddlement, a nice beer."

Red wine aroma, dark plums and hints of caramel. Mellow, cottony with a huge vinous character of plums, sweetened berries and hints of crystallized caramel. Medium thick body. Dry, yet fruity sweet. Almost no hop bitterness initially. Fairly high ABV it seems. Finishes drier with an increased German hop bite and Munich malt emphasis in the aftertaste. An interesting twist on the style, but tasty none the less.

Vysoký Chlumec Vévoda 11%;Vysoky Chlumec, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Vysoký Chlumec (Pivovary Lobkowicz);"Das Vévoda, was nichts anderes als ""Weihwasser"" übersetzt heißt fand ich in einer Spezialitätenbox der Brauereigruppe Lobkowitz. Es ist ein Bier das zuerst versucht mit der brutal bitteren Keule, haut dann aber noch eine buttrige Süffigkeit nach und versucht sich als tschechisches Lager zu beweisen. Dadurch erhält es Charakter und eine Eigenständigkeit, was mir gefällt, allerdings könnte es etwas einfühlsamer sein. Die Bittere im Eingang könnte etwas friedlicher sein und er Übergang zum tollen süffigen Abschluss könnte besser sein. Sonst ein recht schönes Bier."

Pizza Port Norbert Doppelbock;Carlsbad, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Malty, braedy aroma. Bready malt sweetness, toasty, higher than usual hop bitterness towards the end. Not sure if I'd call it a doppelbock or a revved up amber lager.

Cantina;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);355ml bottle. Clear gold pour, mild skunk, mild grain aroma. Falvor is light, light oxidation, light sugar cookie, not as good as corona light, that is about all i can say.
Cantina;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);330ml bottle Gold colour with OK head. Grainy aroma. Light grainy taste But a tick for El Salvador.
Cantina;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Bottle, 4.6%ABV. Orange with a white head. Generic, slightly cardboardy aroma with some grass, vaguely skunky. Mild but not terrible. Really watery. Moderate to low carbonation. Bland and watery with some paper, a hint of corn and a little bitterness. I suppose it’s refreshing because it’s so watery. Offensive by omission.
Cantina;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Pours a clear yellow with no head and lacing. Aroma and taste are pure skunk water. I honestly can’t taste any malt or anything in this one, just skunk. Maybe it’d be slightly better on tap, but I doubt it.
Cantina;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Refrigerated 12 oz. clear bottle poured into glass. Clear golden no head, light body, low carbonation. Taste is malty corn.
Cantina;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);bottle @ Party Town / Florence KY --- Clear, very still, straw color, light white head cover, tiny lace dots. Aroma of malt and an adjunct, which I never find disagreeable in this beer style. Taste suffers from weak taste. It is thin and watery with very little carbonation or hops in the end. It actually isn’t bad for a 3.7% brew, but one certainly can’t compare it to the better brews we’re used to.
Cantina;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Yep kinda like Corona, that weaker cats pissy style, ok for hot day but lacking flavour.
Cantina;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Bottle. Gold color with a medium head. Aroma is a skunky smell. Taste is well watery and just nasty. This is way they put limes in beer.
Cantina;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Rated based on notes taken 27 Oct 2012 -- A surprisingly good Cerveza drank at a Mexican Restaurant in San Antonio.
Cantina;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Bottle: Clear straw gold color with a small head. It had a skunky corn aroma. The taste was watery and sweet corn flavor. It it was packaged differently (clear bottle), I wonder if the taste would have been better.
McCoys Oatmeal Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McCoy's Public House;2018 version, CO2 pushed, 6.2% abv, pours cola brown with lots of tan foam, sweet cocoa aroma and taste, lots of oatmeal flakes that coat your teeth, medium mouthfeel, I liked this sweet oatmeal stout (I had two), tap at brewery.
McCoys Oatmeal Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McCoy's Public House;Slightly below average. Hints of chocolate and roasted malts in the aroma. Decent charcoal color with a nice thin and foamy head. The palate was too light but had a smooth character. Flavors were oatmeal, roasted grains and bitter cocoa. Not a great beer but better than most of the others I’ve had from this brewery.
McCoys Oatmeal Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McCoy's Public House;Deep, chalky brown color. Frothy head that’s everlasting. Aroma is dark, bitter chocolate. Flavir is roasty malt and finish is a pretty strong dark chocolate. Milky texture. Leaves a complete, light tan blanket of lace on the glass. I can’t find the oatmeal... just tastes like a milk stout.
McCoys Oatmeal Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McCoy's Public House;Tap at the KC location brewpub. Looks like a nitro pour. Taste is Guinness clone with tart lemon, ultra light and clean body for SRM, some tootsie roll and chocolate milk flavor. Good lacing. Nose however is sharp mildew. Tasted okay. Aroma becomes almost gamey oyster with hefty sea water and mold. Perhaps displaying the very rare brewing flaw of mold growing in the tanks/pipes/equipment. Very fun brewpub to identify a myriad of brewing flaws: DMS, mildew, cidery, diacetyl, soap, astringency. Quite the excellent study guide for my BJCP exam.
McCoys Oatmeal Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McCoy's Public House;Silky smooth, indeed! Very dark, creamy, malty flavor that is delightful to consume. Heavy lacing on glass, deep dark brown/black color.
McCoys Oatmeal Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McCoy's Public House;February 27, 2013 - tap at Foundry. Dark brown pour with nice head that lasted and lacing. Roasted malt and sprinkle of chocolate in aroma and taste. Very smooth, but very thin and dry finish.

McCoys Oatmeal Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McCoy's Public House;On tap at McCoys. Pours a black color with creamy off white head. Oatmeal, roasted, coffee flavors. Somewhat lighter body for an oatmeal stout, but very drinkable.
McCoys Oatmeal Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McCoy's Public House;A nice dark beer if you like dark beer. It’s the best dark beer made in the Kansas city area
McCoys Oatmeal Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McCoy's Public House;It poured a black color with a light tan head. The aroma was of chocolate and some malty caramel. The taste was very lightly roasted with hints of dark chocolate and some light coffee. A decent Oatmeal Stout.
Pabst Extra Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Desde 2001, fabricado sob contrato para a Pabst Brewing (San Antonio), já que a Pabst não possui mais uma cervejaria própria.
Pabst Extra Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Rating 2900! Vintage can, expired 6/12/06. Pours a clear, dark gold with a half finger bright white head. Aroma of corn and grains, a little cotton candy. Taste is light bitter, mostly grains. Slight hint of oxidation. Nothing spectacular but it’s held up really well for an almost 10-year old beer.
Pabst Extra Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12oz can-Pours clear yellow with no head. Aroma of nothing. Taste of water with a little nothing. This light bodied brew is not too good.
Pabst Extra Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"12oz can from heemer77. Thanks Eric. The can boasts 70 calories per 12 oz serving. ""We know of no beer that is less filling or more refreshing"", it says. Poured a clear pale urine color. The head fizzled quickly and settled to a thin lingering film. Although the nose was not particularly attractive (fresh saltine crackers and broth), I’ve smelled worse. Exceedingly watery mouth feel. I wouldn’t be surprised if the specific gravity was exactly 1.0 as the 2.5% alcohol could theoretically balance out any contents that might otherwise bring it above the specific gravity of water. The flavor was similar to the nose, dainty crackers and soda water. The only way this could get much worse is if it were infected. Of course, the likelihood of that ever happening would be slim to none as most bacteria would have a pretty difficult time scratching out much of an existence in this medium."
Pabst Extra Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Bah, I lost my rating. 12oz can, no date from heemer77, thanks Eric. Incredibly pale straw with a one finger fizzy white head that lasted about 10 seconds before fading to a very thin ring. Aroma had some faint vegetables and watered down sweet malts. Flavor added a bit of watered down soda tang and a fleeting memory of drinking the last ounce of my dad’s crap beer when I was five. Thin, watery mouthfeel with light to moderate fizzy carbonation. There is nothing offensive here because there is nothing here.
Pabst Extra Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;I got a case just so I could rate this one. I am happy I did and am willing to swill down this 70 calorie masterpiece anytime. Pale gold body with a bright white head. The aroma is old sweat socks and strawberry plants in the summer. The taste is like club soda with a little bit of carrot juice in the bell pepper spice finish. Not much else going on as I would expect. Considering the product, this isn’t too bad. Wait, 2.5% abv? This won’t even get you drunk. I take back what I said earlier, this was a waste of my money and I am going to lower my rating due to the low abv.
Pabst Extra Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;If you’re going to drink Pabst, stick with Pabst Blue Ribbon, not this stuff. You’ll be much happier.
Pabst Extra Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12 oz. can. This is pretty balnd stuff. Pours a pale yellow with a fizzy white head that disappeared almost instantly. Scant aroma of corn. Watered down corn cereal flavor. As with most light beers, have a water instead.
Pabst Extra Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Compared to Pabst Blue Ribbon, a slightly better than avaerage macro, this is bad. Not the worst around but close enough to see the pack at the bottom. Not much aroma, VERY light body, much like Coors light. Little to no flavor, thin and bland grain if anything. No really bad aftertaste is all that keeps this out of the worst even in an unspectacular class.
Pabst Extra Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Can. Pours pale yellow with a white head. Aroma of grain and corn. Flavor is weak, watered down, corn, and grainy. Thin bodied, nothing good here.
Squatters Black Forest Schwarzbier;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Tap, which means I assume this is a 4% version.

Squatters Black Forest Schwarzbier;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Bottle pours coffee-black with little hops and chocolate aroma.

Creamy dark chocolate flavor with some marzipan, vanilla, and pecans. Pretty good.
Squatters Black Forest Schwarzbier;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Bottle. Head is initially small, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing. Body is dark brown to black. Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, unsweetened chocolate), lightly hoppy (herbs), with notes of minerals/stones and char, hint of cassis. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Surprisingly decent considering the other 2 beers I’ve tried from Squatters were both drain pours. Minerally and relatively authentic nose. Drinkable balance albeit ultimately too sweet Pretty good job.
Squatters Black Forest Schwarzbier;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Pour from bottle is dark brown to black, clear but light permeates the beer, the aroma is a lager dark malty, taste is roasted crisp, finish is slightly sweet and Smokey
Squatters Black Forest Schwarzbier;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);"Squatters Black Forest Schwarzbier has a thick, foamy, creamy, beige head, a dark brown appearance, and very heavy lacing left behind on the glass. The aroma is of dark malt, brown bread crust, and standardized ""beer smell"". Taste is of creamy, dark malt, brown bread crust, sweetness, and subdued bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit slick, and Squatters Black Forest Schwarzbier finishes crisp, refreshing, and highly drinkable. I can see why this beer has won seven major medals. RJT"

Squatters Black Forest Schwarzbier;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);A quite strong coffee aroma. This is pretty accurate style-wise though way more coffee than I’d like. Okay.
Samuel Adams Vienna Style;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Boston Beer Company;12oz bottle. Poured a clear and deep amber color. A thin foamy head of tan foam. The aroma yields deep and rich molasses like notes with a sweet nut-like quality. The taste is full of fine weighty malts. Caramel comes through, along with woody and earthy notes. A nutty bitterness appears in the finish. Full flavored and overall a good beer.
Samuel Adams Vienna Style;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Boston Beer Company;Notes from 2004 - Not the best thing to ever come down the pike at Sam Adams, but drinkable. A sweet caramel malt background, a bit of salty nuttiness, and some dried fruit glaze the palate, dry finish, but not overly complex. Did nothing to wow me.

Samuel Adams Vienna Style;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Boston Beer Company;Not too familiar with this style, was more remniscent of a strong amber. Poured an amber orange with some brown and a fluffly off-white head. Aroma was roasted malt, dry hops and hints of fruit. Taste was caramel, along with roasted nuts, grapes, prunes and spicy hops. After is well-balanced. Good drinking beer.

Samuel Adams Vienna Style;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Boston Beer Company;Pretty good. I used to love this but then I got more educated about beer. This beer is unique tasting and difficult to find at least as far as I know. If you’re not a big beer drinker you’ll probably dig this beer.
Samuel Adams Vienna Style;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Boston Beer Company;Not a bad offering, just not the best Jim Koch has to give. Nonetheless, it’s a mild beer that should entertain a few wannabe beer drinkers for a while. Heck, it entertained me for a little while.
Samuel Adams Vienna Style;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Boston Beer Company;Bottle: Deep amber color and a lasting eggshell head. Lots of malt along with earth, oak, toast. As others have mentioned, this has a similar taste to the winter lager. Not bad.
Dark Mountain Kolsch Blonde Ale;Vail, Arizona, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Dark Mountain Brewery;"Backlog, from notes. On tap @ the brewery, 24 May 2001. After tasting two ""sours"" (i.e. infected brews) this one was OK. Lots of malt & grain & solidly hopped, which made it better than a German Kölsch."
Dark Mountain Kolsch Blonde Ale;Vail, Arizona, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Dark Mountain Brewery;Blonde gold color, small head. Lighter taste. Slight malt sweetness. Somewhat wheat beer like in character, there is a subtle banana and clove like taste to this beer. Light bodied. Light and refreshing. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is malty and slightly sweet.

Humpty Dumpty Spark Arrester;Reedham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Humpty Dumpty Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Live & Let Live, Kings Lynn, Norfolk. Dark Brown beer with malt head. A bittersweet lightish stout with a significant alcohol nose. Fruity and woody, I had it down as a strong Mild.
Humpty Dumpty Spark Arrester;Reedham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Humpty Dumpty Brewery;Bottle conditioned. Dark red/brown with an off-white head. Aromas are malty with chocolate and berries. Quite sweet with some earthiness. Flavours are berries and chocolate, quite malty - then dry and hoppy. Quite thin on the palate yet pretty fruity.
Humpty Dumpty Spark Arrester;Reedham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Humpty Dumpty Brewery;Bottle conditioned. Deep ruby red-brown. Good beige head and good condition. Aroma starts with roast barley moves onto chocolate then settles on a slight oaky tartness. In the mouth there was a blend of chocolate powder and fruity raisins. Finish was soft with a dry roasted barley edge and mouth filling bubbles that didnt seem to have that CO2 sharpness I would have expected.

Goose Island Red Felt Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Shared bottle from a cellar cleaning. Pours reddish brown with a small beige head. Way past it’s prime. Was worth a try, but can see how this would have been a decent one in it’s time.
Goose Island Red Felt Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);A: Pours a deep red/cranberry with an off-white, almost light pinkish head with great lace. Holding up to the light gives this a beautiful ruby color. S: A fig-like smell with some nice back spice. Malts are present with small hints of raspberries and blackberries. T: Light grape with other subtle fruits with a dry malt back. Taste is not as pronounced as the smell but still good. M: Medium body while going down smooth. Not much mouth feel as the tastes do not linger for very long. O: A good, but not great red ale. I enjoy some aspects about the smell, but the taste sort of fell short for me. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 05-17-2011

Goose Island Red Felt Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap into a tasting glass...A light clear and bright amber. An off white head, ok retention...A boring aroma that does not show off the hops like I was expecting or the tastes reveals...The taste is a really good hoppy red beer. Caramel backbone, sweet malts to start but a big burst of pine pines on the back, fresh, seems dry hopped. Powerful, flavorful and very tasty to drink if you want a hoppy beer with flavor. Slight metallic resin finish that I could do without. Worth trying.

Middle Ages Ape Hanger Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Middle Ages Brewing;Called Dinosaur Ape Hanger, not Middle Ages. On tap at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. It is a little sour and funky, with some surprising complexity for a 5% brew, yet goes down easily. A good one.

Empire Red Mulligan;Syracuse, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Empire Brewing Company;From 2002: Deep red color, mild hops, fruit, slight malt in the nose. Tastes about the same with some earthy notes, and caramel. Overall a pretty bland taste with a mild finish.
Empire Red Mulligan;Syracuse, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Empire Brewing Company;We were never entirely sure if this was the red or not, (our glasses got mixed up) but we decided it was by elimination. It was decent but some malt and hops to notice, but unimpressive compared to their other offerings.
Empire Red Mulligan;Syracuse, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Empire Brewing Company;Ruby red, with mahogany tinges. Smelled like faint fruit aroma with some hops, but not strong. Initial taste was. . . bland. Malty with some hops, beer was very dry. As it warms, some more earthy tones emerge, and there is some blackberry/cherry notes that faintly appear. Ends without much of a flavor left on the palatte.

Empire Dunkelweizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Empire Brewing Company;Nov 00: Reminded me of Aventinus from Germany, but with more subdued clove flavors and less alcoholic kick. On the whole I like Empire's version better I think
Empire Dunkelweizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Empire Brewing Company;Cloudy appearance a bit like of an English tea, nice aroma, refreshing, classic. Slightly salty, alcoholic flavours with tropical fruits.
Empire Dunkelweizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Empire Brewing Company;Very dark orange. Candyish aroma. Body is sweet, touches of yeast, banana. Finishes hoppy. Spritzy.
Empire Dunkelweizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Empire Brewing Company;"Sampled at Syracuse location. Dark amber, cloudy; lots of bubblegum, banana, papaya in both aroma and palate. No real dark malt presence. Light yeastiness in the finish. With this beer I have now sampled more American beers than Canadian. This might flip flop the next little while, of course, but a big turning point in my beer tasting."
Syracuse Suds Factory Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Syracuse Suds Factory;Draft @ The pub. Well, at least it looks proper. Hazy gold with a thick cap of head in the taster. Nose is a very light citrus. Flavor is generic yeast and notes of lemon. Ok, everybody is entitled to an off batch.
Syracuse Suds Factory Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Syracuse Suds Factory;Light spice aroma, wheaty, clove. Light bodied, some citrus/lemon. Not too bad.
Syracuse Suds Factory Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Syracuse Suds Factory;A weizen served with TWO lemon wedges. I like: At least it’s not as offensive as the black chery lambic. I dislike: Finally, those lemon wedges were most welcome as they provided most of the flavours in there. Sweet all throughout. The wheat texture is felt all right, but fails to provide the usual refreshment. Relatively thick and untight as well.
Syracuse Suds Factory Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Syracuse Suds Factory;An almost amber pour with creamy white head and lace. An aroma of caramel malt and light bannana and corriander. A semi sweet malt flavor with tones of fruitiness. Medium bodied. Decent bitter with a nice aftertaste. Pretty good.
Syracuse Suds Factory Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Syracuse Suds Factory;Damnit, they put a damn lemon slice in here before they brought it. You know, just because it’s a wheat beer, doesn’t necessarily mean that you should start stuffing fruit wedges in there. Anyway, (rant off) starts off rather sweet from banana and a little bit from the malts. Gets way too sour as it warms ... probably from the damn fruit wedge. I shouldn’t penalize the beer for the supplement they added, but it shouldn’t be there in the first place. I just saw that this is characterized as a hefe ... uh, no. This lies somewhere between a dunkel and a hefe. Way too dark to be a hefe, and not dark enough for a dunkel. Who knows ...
Syracuse Suds Factory Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Syracuse Suds Factory;Aroma:Lighjt malt flavor..... Appearance:Orange no-head.... Flavor:Light bittrness,candy flavor.... This is the worstes weizen i drink in my life....

Syracuse Suds Factory Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Syracuse Suds Factory;(Draught) Cloudy orange-amber body - rather dark for a weizen? - and a thin, white head. Nice carbonation. Tart nose. Sour, acidic, no banana or spices - what gives? Tart finish.
Syracuse Suds Factory Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Syracuse Suds Factory;Malty nose, with little spices in the aroma. Tart acidic tang, like a beer starting to be infected. No bananas or spices.
Syracuse Suds Factory Weizen;Syracuse, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Syracuse Suds Factory;Dunkel. Light soy/sherry aroma. Diacetyl and cidery, medium sweetness, not much hop, some caramel malt bitterness. Syrupy body with long cider finish that fades into a long hop finish.
Syracuse Suds Factory Brown Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;This was watery and bland, with zero aroma. Terrible. A Mr. Beer kit can make better. Avoid at all costs.
Syracuse Suds Factory Brown Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;Dark brown. Aroma is maple syrup, hint of citrus, malty. Medium to light body. Not too bad.
Syracuse Suds Factory Brown Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;Deep brown amber pour. Medium caramel and honey maltiness on the nose. Cloying maltiness on the flavor with a semi sour finish. Thin but not bad carbonation was good. Overall a decent offering.
Syracuse Suds Factory Brown Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;I guess I’m in the minority with this one. Nice earthy aroma with a hint of sweetness. Peaty and nutty mouthfeel with a slight caramel sweetness to it. Rather drinkable, and one of the better samples of the night.

Syracuse Suds Factory Brown Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;Sample at the brewpub. Medium clear walnut, hints of foam...sweet nuts in an diacetyl-tainted buttery nose...sourness present throughout the body and an odd vinous quality, but there’s a bit of nice sugary nuttiness underneath.
Syracuse Suds Factory Brown Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;Nice smoked malty aroma. Not much else going on in the nose. Almost opaque mahogany with small white head. Well, this has potential. VINEGAR! HOLY SHIT! I can’t drink this crap. Water+Vinergar+Smoked Malts = Brown Ale. This was purely putrid and undrinkable. The vast and overwhelming majority of beers at the Ratebeer homebrew competition vastly exceeded this beer. How these people can make money is amazing. Homebrewers, go for it...you cant be this bad!
Syracuse Suds Factory Brown Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;(Draught) Thin, dissipating beige head and brown body. Slight malt nose. Pleasant caramel flavour and slightly carbonated. Nice gritty finish.
Syracuse Suds Factory Brown Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;Sweet malt aroma, but again the lactic acid barrage, with some sweetness thrown inn...depressing.
Syracuse Suds Factory Brown Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Syracuse Suds Factory;Butter, cherry and vinegar aroma. Very deep brown. Standard Newcastle knockoff -- cidry and undermatured, tastes like my early homebrew. Medium hopping, light fruit and sweetness. Hops are a bit too brewed.

Brains IPA (4.5%);Cardiff, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brains;"Dark orange appearance. Caramel, sweet malt and some sort of a ""cheezie"" smell that I''ve come across twice in one night.

New Glarus Symposium Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;"For review #5,000, this milestone beer had an interesting story of how it was acquired in the first place. When I attended the Great Taste of the Midwest 2012, I was disenchanted as I noticed my favorite food vendor, Baumgartner’s, didn’t set up a food stand at the festival. What’s this? No Wisconsin limburger cheese on rye with red onions, and a bottle of Blumers root beer for lunch this year? We can’t have that! This was the first time in ten years Baumgartner’s didn’t show up and I had to modify my festival routine this year. Well, a few weeks later, I stopped at Baumgartner’s in Monroe while visiting the southwest breweries of Wisconsin. As I was writing a few beer reviews on my iPad, a gentleman sitting next to me noticed me updating ratebeer database and started a conversation with me about some of the historical breweries of Wisconsin. I would never turn down an opportunity to archive more beer history so we talked for over an hour. During our conversation, he said he used to work for New Glarus Brewing Company. He also mentioned that he still had a bottle of New Glarus Symposium Eisbock in his cellar. I asked him what would it take for me to purchase the bottle of New Glarus Symposium Eisbock from him? He said ""Buy me a round of beer and it’s yours."" He came back 20 minutes later and handed me the bottle (the one featured in this profile page). Not only did I bought him a round of beer, I bought him lunch and three rounds of beer for his generosity. A month later I stopped at Baumgartner’s again and the gentleman was there too. I bought him two more rounds of beer. So when you are visiting breweries and writing beer reviews, always make time to talk to curious people who are observing what you are doing. You’ll never know what they may offer you. From a 12-oz bottle pours a hazy dark yellowish brown colored brew with no head, yet a thin beige film top slowly dissipates. Aroma of brown sugar, a hint of soy and mild raisin and dark pitted fruit. Taste is medium to full bodied, very little carbonation if any with flavors of powdery roasted dark malts, raisin, brown sugar some prune and toffee. Finish is quite smooth, a tad on the sweet side with aftertastes if oxidized caramel malts, brown sugar and a touch of soy. Everything I expected from a 12-year old bottle of Eisbock."
New Glarus Symposium Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;Tasted 1/13/13. Courtesy of Skyview. Many thanks! Dark brown color with no head. Big aroma of brown sugar. Strong, malt flavor with a lot of brown sugar. Light metalic notes and a bit of aged soy sauce character. Quite dry. Tastes like a hybrid of an aged Ayinger Celebrator and a JW Lees Harvest Ale on its way to 20 years.
New Glarus Symposium Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle shared by BenC...thanks Ben! I didn’t rate this as it is almost too hard to rate. 11 years old and it did show, but you can still pick up on all the fine points of this brew. Wish I could have had this one fresh, but so glad that I got to try this!
New Glarus Symposium Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;This poured a murky brown color with a biege head. Aroma was lots na d lots of cardboard, some caramel, and mint too. Flavor was sticky sweet, very oxidized cardboard and mint with very light roast too. Definitely gone.
New Glarus Symposium Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;Had this at the 2011 Pittsburgh Ratebeer Christmas Eve Eve Tasting. Since there are only a few ratings for this rare beer, I will not mention who gave it to me. I will spare him the fun hatemail. First I want to say that I never ever dreamed i would have a chance to taste this. Yes the aroma is a bit oxidized, but what would you expect? A little rosey looking in the glass. No way am I tasting a beet that is 11 years old, how could this be? Totally flat, more like a PA state store produdct than a beer, is this an aperitif? Very strong but uniquely has a somewhat slight watery finish, not viscous at all. Yes, stong liqour finish fer sure.
New Glarus Symposium Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;tepid chestnut, hazy, thin white ring. Nose is oxidized, caramel, date, light apple and tooth pick. Flavor is light caramel and cherry, heavy oxidation, light paper in finish, more toasted malt. Body is supportive of this, but if not for sweetness, this would be unbearable.
New Glarus Symposium Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;Dark brown-lots of orange edges and beige head. Aroma is loads of cardboard, oxidized, loads of caramel. Taste is a bit thin, lots of toffee, caramel. Definitely old, interesting to try. Many thanks BenC.
New Glarus Symposium Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle generously shared by BenC...thanks Ben! - Pour mahogany with a thin off-white head. Warming booze on the nose, but not very pungent. Dark fruits and sweet dark malt, but very muted. Gets better as it warms. Taste is much more pungent, with lots of raisins, sweet plum, bourbon, and dark bread malt--still very rich. A bit of an abrupt finish with some buttery sweetness and sharp bitter malt, but otherwise very pleasant. Medium body, a bit thinner than I would have imagined, but I guess that’s what 11 years will do to a beer. Wow...another one I would have loved to have fresh.

New Glarus Symposium Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;Degarth is the man for trading me this bottle. Dark copper body Fairly see through. The aroma shows signs of oxidation as does the body, but seems to be very well under control for a brew thats sat in the bottle 6 years. Flavor is filled with dark fruit, the alcohol has subsided and blends nicely with the other components. Lacks the palate of other eisbocks I’ve had, not sure if this has to do with the age. Either way its damn good and would drink it again if the chance presented itself.
Ceres Royal Autumn;Århus, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ceres Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);An amber beer with a little head. It has a slightly sour fruity aroma and a sour geuze like sharp flavor. A great addition to the danish beer assortment.
Nimbus Old Monkeyshine;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Strong Ale - English;Nimbus Brewing Company;Dark, oily brown color with a short-lived head of slick and soft bubbly tan foam. Big caramel base front with a subtle cutting of the sweetness by some herbal hops. There is fig, dates, florals, and some earthiness swirling around the strong caramel backbone. A big English beer. Great!
Nimbus Old Monkeyshine;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Strong Ale - English;Nimbus Brewing Company;"12oz bottle from Top Shelf Liquors, Cottonwood, AZ at 8.2% stated ABV. A cola coloured pour with a ring of cream head; aroma of mollasses and brown sugar with a hint of malt; sweet malty taste with some spice and lots of sugar; and then a satisfying burnt caramel finish with some chewy raisins. This Englishman thinks it's rather good."
Nimbus Old Monkeyshine;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Strong Ale - English;Nimbus Brewing Company;From Jul 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with Tayner. Thanks Dana! It pours a dark brown with reddish hues and a good 2 finger head of off white foam. Good head retention and there's some lacing. The smell has notes of roasted malt, some caramel, and a bit of bread. The taste is of toffee, dark fruit. some caramel, slight chocolate, and a slight bitterness and tartness. I also get some hint of the alcohol but it's fairly mild. It's around medium bodied and the carbonation is also medium. It finishes with the dark fruit, mostly cherry and some plum and raisin. This is an interesting brew and though the flavours I mentioned say it is very complex, I feel the flavours are actually on the subdued side. That's ok for an English Brown but with the bigger abv content than is the norm, I guess I expected more. Still pretty tasty brew though.
Nimbus Old Monkeyshine;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Strong Ale - English;Nimbus Brewing Company;Bottle shared. Clear dark brown with a beige head of foam. The aroma has oaly vanilla notes. Hints of fudge and toffee in the taste. Sweet and roasty as well. Big body and medium carbonation.

Okay retention, good lacing. Aroma is malt and spicy earthy hops. Taste is syrupy. Not super malty. Spicy hops perhaps over done. Mouthfeel is light medium bodied. Lightly dry. Almost papery. Overall it’s a little below average. Lots of this style out there, it doesn’t rise above the others. I wouldn’t recommend it and wouldn’t buy it again.

Blue Point Oktoberfest;Patchogue, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Another sample of the flood of Oktoberfests out there this season. On the lighter side, but smooth mouthfeel. Probably a tad better than average in this style. Thin orangish to light brown appearance. Wanted to try a single first before deciding on a 6-pack, but will probably pass on this one. Good to try though, and would recommend at least once.

Ceredigion Blodeuwedd (Flowerface);New Quay, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bragdy Ceredigion;A Mes rate: Bottle at Chris O’s laid back Friday night tasting. Pale gold with a thin white head. Old paper, peppery and earthy and slightly oxidised. Faint hops just about surviving for the finish. Straight forward.

Ceredigion Blodeuwedd (Flowerface);New Quay, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bragdy Ceredigion;Really light yellowish (cloudy look) that was not promising much, plus that unattractive weak foam .Weak aroma .I was not impressed. Boring, flat.
Shiva Premium Lager;Enfield, Ireland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Celtic Brewing Co.;Although it describes itself as a lager, it’s much more of an ale I’d say. Decent enough appearance, with fairly rich head, but no lacing. Malt and hops on the nose, and similar on the palate, and middling mouthfeel.
Shiva Premium Lager;Enfield, Ireland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Celtic Brewing Co.;"Amber colour; corn & fusels, like all good lagers; light, watery finish. Could have been worse, but if I were naming my beer after a god, I'd make more an effort, personally. Not exactly a prime homage."
Shiva Premium Lager;Enfield, Ireland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Celtic Brewing Co.;Light golden color. Light hops in the aroma. Body is organic and bitter. Finishes dry. Not a bad brew, fairly standard.
Shiva Premium Lager;Enfield, Ireland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Celtic Brewing Co.;Yeah... it that average thick head, 24k golden look. Not bad mouthfeel but not the best aftertaste.
Shiva Premium Lager;Enfield, Ireland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Celtic Brewing Co.;I picked up a bottle of this in London this summer, thinking it would be a Nepalese beer (and a new country). It turns out, unfortunately, that it is brewed in England (Cornwall, I think) for a Nepalese restaurant in Ireland. Nice label--a brew made for the gods?--no, just typically mediocre beer. It might be o.k. with a good plate of Nepalese food, however. I wasn't going to rate this when I couldn't find a proper, established brewery, but I'm glad to see it made the database anyway.
St. Austell 1851 Vintage Ale;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;St. Austell Brewery;330ml bottle @ monthly tasting at Chez Sophie, June 16, thanks to Mike for digging this relic out of his cellar. Pours muddy mahogany, minimal head. Aroma is dank cobwebs, which also dominate in the taste, although I can just about pick out it’s rich port-like barley wine character. We tried to like this, but the dust and cobwebs were a bit overpowering. Like bladdock I’ve tried to rate kindly.
St. Austell 1851 Vintage Ale;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;St. Austell Brewery;14th June 2016: Shrewsbury Beer Share. Thanks Mike, for this month’s ’Cobweb Beer’. Do not usually rate our monthly cobweb but thought this was worthy of being rated. Bottle number 02672 was split between five of us. red hue to the brown body, wispy head. Wine/Port like aroma and taste, sweet and rich: just beginning to turn with a slight acetic acid feel to the brew. Still very drinkable after all these years but now well past it’s best. Scored objectively and kindly, because it must have been a fantastic beer when drank in date.
St. Austell 1851 Vintage Ale;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;St. Austell Brewery;Milder than most barleywines that I have tried to date. Carmels, fruitiness, and malty tones lighten the overall presence of alcohol. Kind of syrup like on the palate, smooth to drink overall.
St. Austell 1851 Vintage Ale;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;St. Austell Brewery;Vintage 2001. Bottle 01661. A pleasant barleywine. Very sweet and full bodied with notes of fruit and caramel.
St. Austell 1851 Vintage Ale;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;St. Austell Brewery;certainly divided opinion at the table. interesting burnt caramle aroma. . strange cherry syrup taste and with some very late bitterness. really tickles your throat on the way down
St. Austell 1851 Vintage Ale;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;St. Austell Brewery;Rich sweetness, thick and syruppy/sugary, also got the Turkish delight flavour betty mentions. To sweet and fat, no balancing dryness. Warm alcohol in the finish.
St. Austell 1851 Vintage Ale;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;St. Austell Brewery;"Great -- Sweetish. I just like it. Rye Vita (although I had just been eating estonian Rye bread). There is Turkish delight all over the place and if you can't taste that you're crazy. I dunno why my note on this one ends with ""eat my deadly farts"" other than because I was maggot by this point in the evening."
St. Austell 1851 Vintage Ale;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;St. Austell Brewery;overwhelming combination of thick crystal malt sweetness with bitterness. if youre into big flavours i guess it's good. not badly made or anything, just hard for me to get into with the massive sweetness/bitterness thing, like some of those big american bw's. alcohol is hidden if that sort of thing is important to you.
St. Austell 1851 Vintage Ale;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;St. Austell Brewery;This is a little like drinking liquid dynamite.Strong almost overpoweringly complex flavours only to be tried if you like your beer sweet.Not to be swilled down unless you have a death wish.Sip and enjoy.
St. Austell 1851 Vintage Ale;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;St. Austell Brewery;To celebrate 150 years of independent family brewing St Austell made a one off batch of this bottle conditioned and very fine Barley Wine in 2001. There are still some bottles left in a few outlets, and if this 18 month old example is anything to go by they are well worth tracking down to drink now or allowed to age a few more years. The alcohol at this point is still noticable, but is already starting to mellow. Rum soaked sultanas, almonds, bananas, apple, rich fruit cake, toffee and caramel, slow dripping mollases, red wine, oak, musky oil. The flavours are there, and they are wrapped in a soft, luscious, warm duvet of a body - so big you could dive in and feel that you've never hit bottom. For lovers of big, sweet malty ales this is one to sip and savour.
San Andreas Earthquake Pale Ale;Hollister, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;San Andreas Brewing;Vintage bottle, 13-15 years old. Clear orange-tinged brilliant color, large bubbles dissipating quickly. Undrinkable at this age. Off-hop aroma, slightly sour depressed malt taste, thin body, thick dark brown fine yeast on bottom of bottle. Color is the only thing that held the test of time, and it's beautiful to look at.
San Andreas Earthquake Pale Ale;Hollister, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;San Andreas Brewing;Golden in color with no head, large loose buddles around the rim. Aroma is of sweet malt,fruit, butter/butter scotch candy. Flavor is sweet malty at the start then finishes burnt and bitter with earthy hops.
San Andreas Earthquake Pale Ale;Hollister, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;San Andreas Brewing;Bottle: Labelled Earthquake Pale. Smells like kitty litter, tastes a bit like kitty litter. Maybe this beer is really old. However there is no date on the bottle, so I guess the brewer doesn’t care if it is too old.
San Andreas Earthquake Pale Ale;Hollister, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;San Andreas Brewing;On tap. Gold with lasting head. Faint malt nose. Not exactly strongly hopped bet certainly a very lasting finish
San Andreas Earthquake Pale Ale;Hollister, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;San Andreas Brewing;Golden color, medium head. Slightly malty, somewhat sweet ale. Mildly hopped.

Ozark IPA;Fayetteville, Arkansas, United States;IPA;Ozark Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy golden color. Two fingers bone colored head. Good retention, good lacing, though it doesn't cling. Probably unfiltered. Aroma is spicy bready. Probably some rye. Floral and citrus hops. Pine resin. Smells really good.<o>Taste is not as good as aroma. Still has spicy taste. Pine resin. Pretty bitter. Just a hint of lemon peel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Bitterness hangs on a little longer than I would like. Goes from bitter to spicy finish. Interesting. Overall, it is a pretty good beer. It's certainly different, never had an IPA quite like this, and that's a good thing. I'd recommend it, but it's a one and done for me, unless it were on tap.
Ozark IPA;Fayetteville, Arkansas, United States;IPA;Ozark Brewing Company;Draft at the source. Golden hue with a white head. Aroma and taste of citrus, tropical fruit, pine, caramel. Decent.

Ozark IPA;Fayetteville, Arkansas, United States;IPA;Ozark Brewing Company;On tap in beer mug. Nice 1 inch head dissipates rapidly but leaves nice lacing. Aroma is not very forward but hoppy and citrusy. I blame the light aroma on the glass. Color is a nice deep gold with a slightly reddish hue. Taste is nice and bitter on the front and and fruity at the finish. Malt flavor lingers. Slightly slick/oily texture, very nice. Overall a very good IPA.
Ozark IPA;Fayetteville, Arkansas, United States;IPA;Ozark Brewing Company;Excellent IPA. Very drinkable and balanced with very fresh and potent hop character. A little more citrus and pine than their APA. Nice work guys.
Ozark IPA;Fayetteville, Arkansas, United States;IPA;Ozark Brewing Company;Tap in rogers, Arkansas. Dark gold with nice head and decent lacing. Light fruit in nose. Taste is more bitter than expected and not all from hoppiness, balance could have been better. Fairly typical but needed refinement.

Tooheys 2.2 Lite;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);No flavour, boring flat look. Pretty much awful all round. Can't even get drunk off it and it has no flavour like some lite beers.
Tooheys 2.2 Lite;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);She'll be right mate, Tooheys all nite mate, its got the flavour that you savour, drink it all night mate, Tooheys lite. So said the advertising I think. Say no more. Someone said this tasted like shit, they were wrong, it doesn't have the body nor mouthfeel.

Tooheys 2.2 Lite;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);dubs is right as usual. all the flavour you`d find and dislike in tooheys new is still there but it''s very thin. i was once on a train where 3 guys went through $500 worth of the stuff as it was the only beer they sold in the buffet car
Tooheys 2.2 Lite;Lidcombe, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tooheys Brothers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Hmm. This must be the greatest beer of all time. Oh... only if `greatest` means absolutely lame, horrible and rank. Why not just drink fermented poison laced with carbon sulfuride acid? Look, I hope I`m not the only one to rate this. I suggested it be added, and I`m the first. Let`s say I downed a fair few of these in my time. Oh yes, quite a lot. Now if you`re after good beer, try anything else including non-beers. I`m not sure this even qualifies as beer. It is rather akin to water with beer cordial added - diet version. Very bad brew (assuming it IS brewed). Like I said, one of the all time greatest. That guy in the ad who chucked his keys in the air can rest safe knowing I sold his Ma some CRACK for more than street value.
Typhoon IPA;New York, New York, United States;IPA;Typhoon Restaurant & Brewery;Dark amber. Well bittered but not super hoppy. Dry. Perhaps the best beer here, but that''s not saying much.
Typhoon IPA;New York, New York, United States;IPA;Typhoon Restaurant & Brewery;Pretty damn bitter. Yeah, I''m aware it''s supposed to be that way, but somehow I couldn''t get all that enthused about it. Maybe it''s because the Texas Longhorns were getting beat on the brewpub TV by Oklahoma at the time I was tasting this beer. Can''t know for sure, but it seemed one-dimensional, sort of like an Imperial IPA.
Herman Helles;Turku, Finland;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Panimoravintola Herman;Dark orange colored, cloudy appearance. Little vanishing white head.

Flatters the classic German style, mostly grassy with some sweet maltiness a little yeasty, but with a much longer bitter finish than most. Not my style, but vastly better than any macro beer.

Koulu Reksi;Turku, Finland;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Panimoravintola Koulu;Draught @ the brewpub Aroma is completely nothing, perhaps hints of hay. Sourish berries, gooseberry bush and honey occurs during drinking. Flavour has malt, fruity notes, honey, sweet malts, hints of apricot, grain and hay. Also some grassy hops in the background.

Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine;Milton, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogfish Head Brewery;These fruity barleywines are too sweet for me. That being said, I enjoyed the flavor and appreciate everything that is going on here. Cloudy light amber appearance. This is more of a European style barleywine, or resemblance of something Belgian....versus the American style semi-hoppy barleywine. I probably should have aged this for a year or two....but was too curious.
Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine;Milton, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogfish Head Brewery;Bottle, about a year old, poured into a snifter. Poured hazy nut-brown with some orange to it. 1-finger bone-colored head. Caramel-sweet aroma with some fruit notes. Full-bodied, with a syrupy thickness. Mild boozy astringency to the finish. Flavor was malty-sweet with the fruit notes underneath. Good, but could probably have benefitted from a little more aging.
Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine;Milton, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogfish Head Brewery;Bouteille datée de 2010, bue après plus de 8 ans. Robe rougeâtre rendue trouble par une pléthore de particules foncées flottant allègrement et surmontée d'un léger col de mousse blanchâtre qui s'estompe rapidement. Arômes de raisins secs, datte, baies confites, malt très caramélisé, canne à sucre, houblons amerisants et bien entendu des relents d'alcool vieillots. En bouche, malt caramélisé, datte et beaucoup de baies faisant penser à un vin rouge californien. Il y a également une foule d'autres saveurs comme alcool de baies, café, raisins secs, bois imprégné d'alcool, quartier d'orange séché. Finale un peu herbacée et terreuse avec de légères traces de matières grillées. Texture vineuse et soyeuse, corps moyen à rond. Bien dans l'ensemble, le très haut taux d'alcool est bien intégré, même si je ne puis dire si c'est une conséquence du vieillissement. Mais encore là, je me questionne sur la pertinence d'avoir un si haut niveau d'alcool dans cette bière.
Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine;Milton, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours an amber color with a short beige head. Unassuming nose of ripe fruitiness and candies caramel. Caramel, vegetal, fruity, and alcoholic flavors.
Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine;Milton, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogfish Head Brewery;6 years old. Malt, raisin, fig, date, sweet, strong, round, mellow. Like one of those ridiculously strong Russian beers, but actually good.
Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine;Milton, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours cloudy dark amber with ruby tint and thin, off white head that dissipates quickly.

Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine;Milton, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours with a malt-like aroma and a thin head.

This is a murky, ruby colored beer that has small glistening beige head. Smells richly of dates with a boozy essence. A big, bad, bold beauty of a brew. It strikes with soft carbonation, low bitterness, restrained sweetness, and a buzzy alcohol feel/taste without being too hot. Flavor of note are dates/figs and honey-caramel. This is an example of an ultra high ABV beer that works. Imperial barleywine...
Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine;Milton, Delaware, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dogfish Head Brewery;Late 2016-Early 2017 bottle from Val-U aged for a year. Pours a pretty copper with a finger of off-white foam that lingers, then dissipates. Very fruit-forward nose: bright raspberry, plum and currant. Sweet on the palate without being cloying. Dried apricot, fig and more fresh plum, and apricot. Some raisin and currant as it warms. Finish is a bit warming but feels nowhere near 15%. Really solid.
General Lafayette Imperial Stout;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;Draft. Pours near black with a tan head.

General Lafayette Imperial Stout;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;This was the best beer that I sampled under the general’s roof.

General Lafayette Imperial Stout;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;shared by Dickinsonbeer at BBD 07. Just about black in color with a light brown head. Aroma was pretty nice and the usuals for an IS- roast, coffee, chocolate, caramel, light notes of dark fruit. Taste incorporated the items listed in the aroma. Nice and full bodied, creamy texture. Very well balanced between the hop bittering, roast, and sweet malts.
General Lafayette Imperial Stout;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;"Growler, courtesy of dmac621. Thanks, Dave! Pours a murky, dark brown color; light brown head with patchy lacing. Smoky, roasted malts and dark chocolate; some coffee. Dense, dried dark fruits and roasted coffee in the mouthfeel; slightly fizzy carbonation. Lengthy, dry coffee and dark chocolate finish."
General Lafayette Imperial Stout;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;Vintage unknown. Sampled from a growler. Carbonation is soft, flavors are subtle milk chocolate, charred fruit and it has a bit of creamy mocha in the finish, but again, the flavors are pretty subtle and faint. A little pasty on the palate, alcohol easily noticed, with some vodka/potato flavors as well... which is stranga. Nice is very light and faint, with milk chocolate and cocoa scents. Looks good, though, with a brown mocha head.
General Lafayette Imperial Stout;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Copper Crow Beer Company;Hand bottle from Ty5592 thanks ty.

President's Choice Svijetlo;Osijek, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Osječka Pivovara;Bottled. A very light golden beer with a white head. The aroma is sweet malty with light notes of honey, the flavor is sweet malty with light notes of metal.
President's Choice Svijetlo;Osijek, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Osječka Pivovara;It’s light golden with a small head. The aroma has a bit of acetone, but also a little malt. The flavour is slightly dry with a somewhat crude bitterness and light hints of malt. An odd one.

President's Choice Svijetlo;Osijek, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Osječka Pivovara;0.33 l can. Poured pale yellow body with tiny head. Aroma is slightly citrus hops and some weak malts. Bitterish flavor, not watery as I expected it to be, medium bodied. Quite lot of carbonation...finish is medium long, bitterish, just a bit dry. Good for a supermarket beer, but still boring average pale lager.
President's Choice Svijetlo;Osijek, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Osječka Pivovara;Can. Thanks Ognjan. Pours a slightly hazish yellow colour with a big short lasting bubbly white head. Sweet aroma of grains. Sweet waterish flavour of grains corns and some maltish touch. Sweet rather uncomfortable aftertaste.
President's Choice Svijetlo;Osijek, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Osječka Pivovara;it is one of the worst beer in my country Croatia.... i think that only what is good about this beer is price ... every time i go in GETRO i buy i 6 or 12 beer ...
President's Choice Svijetlo;Osijek, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Osječka Pivovara;"New review: I’ve always felt that I was too biased whit his beer (because of what my friend said), so I decided to rerate it. 0.5l (green) can from Getro. It poured an enormous, fluffy but thick white head. It was quite fizzy, and of a pale yellow colour. Not promising. The nose was sourish, slightly metallic, yet somehow ""fresh"". The taste... well, it beats Osječko. It’s watery, sure, but everything but offensive. There’s a nice lemony hops touch and a mild hoppy aftertaste. Lacks malt (only some extremely faint traces). Easy drinking. Old Review:Hmm, yes, this is the cheapest Croatian beer (but I think K plus comes close), and while this is certainly a lot less offensive than its Konzum counterpart, this isn’t anything special. Light golden colour, no head that I remember, watery, and bready taste. I tasted it because one of my friends said it was the worst beer he tried ever. While it’s not the worst, it’s far from good, and even from average. (4/2/4/2/7)"
President's Choice Svijetlo;Osijek, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Osječka Pivovara;Light golden with an ok head. Sweet, malty aroma with some caramel and dark sugar. Hoppy, grassy flavor with sweet tones and some bitterness in the finish. I saw that this is the cheapeast croatian beer, I wish the cheapest swedish beers were as good...
Left Hand Goosinator Doppelbock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Left Hand Brewing Company;From Mar 2007 This one pours from 750ml caged and corked bottle(2005) a deep clear amber with a medium sized head of foam that receded rapidly. After the second pour, the foam stuck around much longer and showed some good lacing. The smell is very strong. I'm getting a lot of caramel and roasted malt and it's way on the sweet side, kind of reminds me of butterscotch. The taste on first sip is huge malt....lots of sweet caramel, roasted malt, some dark fruit, and bread. The more sips I take, the more the sweetness seems to subside and is replaced by strong burnt caramel along with some molasses and some bitterness. There's even a touch of sourness in there. Hmmm. I'm not exactly sure if the various flavours are really working all that well together. I'm now on my last pour and....the foam is really thick and billowy now with the clarity I mentioned earlier being replaced by a murky amber and the flavours seem to be meshing more favourably so I'm starting to like this Doppelbock more. I guess my initial experience with the complexity of this brew caught me off guard. Yep, I like it. Bottom line: This starts off a bit muddly but if you persevere with it, it turns out to be a pretty darned good brew in the end. Edit: Jan 2, 2011: 2005 Left Hand Goosinator Still a great looking brew with plenty of foam. Huge caramel malt smell, lots of chocolate and toffee. Lots of the same in the smell with some definite oxidation. Loads of bread in the taste as well. Bottom line, this didn't handle the 5 years well but is still drinkable.
Left Hand Goosinator Doppelbock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Left Hand Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a cloudy brown with small beige head that lasts. The aroma is dark fruit and bready malt. Thick mouth, toasted malt, spruce, light dry finish, decent.
Left Hand Goosinator Doppelbock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Left Hand Brewing Company;"750 ml bottle shared by Tmoney99 (2007 consumed in 2011; notes). Pours a cloudy amber brown color with a medium sized beige head that disappeared quickly. The aroma was sweet, fruity, and floral with more specific notes of caramel and dates. The flavor had a very mild smoke quality to go with the sweet caramel malts and dark ripe fruits. Some signs of oxidation were there. This was still decent given the age."
Left Hand Goosinator Doppelbock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Left Hand Brewing Company;Bottle from Utobeer Market Stall. Brown pour with a beige head.

Left Hand Goosinator Doppelbock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Left Hand Brewing Company;2007 vintage, expensive bottle. When I bought it I didn’t feel I was buying a doppelbock. It pours a deep brownish plum with a fizzy off-white head that produces a bit of lacing. The smell is smoky with a bit of a floral bouquet. There is also some cocoa and malt sweetness. The flavor is sweeter than expected. It has a nuttiness to it that goes pretty nice with the campfire smoke flavor. It is a nice smoked doppelbock, a bit sweet and alcoholic, but nice. Not the best one I have had but it is solid. Probably not worth the price tag however. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 01-04-2011 01:10:57

Left Hand Goosinator Doppelbock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Left Hand Brewing Company;Bottle. 2005. Poured a clear ruddy dark orange color. The head was three fingers high and off white with good retention and decent lacing. Big malty aroma with molasses, caramel, and brown sugar elements. There was also some date and raisin. Medium bodied and sweet. Moderate carbonation with toffee, caramel, and date flavors. Nice. Not as overwhelming in the alcohol or malt departments as the Samichlaus I had last night.

Taste is sweet, and rich and somewhat smokey. Overall a bit light and overall underwhelming.

Sweetwater Tavern Bishops Pass Ale;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Pretty delish from the growler. A nice American attempt a a passable Belgian. It had a nice bite, a bit heavier on the wheat than one would expect and some partiality to a light malt as well. Looks good in the glass. Plesantly fizzy and creamy at the same time. (Growler 9/1/2006)

Sweetwater Tavern High Desert Imperial Stout;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Draft (tapped 2/7/14) at Sweetwater Tavern Merrifield poured into a standard pint glass. According to the board, this batch/year is 8% ABV. Pours black with just over a finger of nice frothy light tan head. Little brown hues around the edges of the glass. Head sticks around for a good bit. Very sparse lacing. Aromas of roast, dark chocolate, light dark fruit, coffee. Hard to get a good smell with the pint glass. Tasting notes of dark fruit including cherries, dark chocolate, caramel, roast. Medium body with a dry and slightly bitter finish. Light creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Pretty good beer and definitely one of GAR’s better brews, probably the best I’ve had from them so far. Wonder how this would compare to the original 10.8% version.

Sweetwater Tavern High Desert Imperial Stout;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Awesome flagon brought by Alex, poured into a perfect pint glass... This is a great looking beer! A dark black body, only the lightest hint of dark brown on the edges in the light. The head is a surprisingly light shade of tan for the body but there is tons of it and it looks great. Creamy and full, a great cap and lacing... The aroma is quite interesting but not my favorite part of the beer, its unique but confusing. Huge cocoa and nut notes that somehow come off to me as fresh green dry hops, reminds me of a fresh Night Stalker. I also get some chocolate, molasses, and weed. Has me interpreting new things, really great... The taste is really roasty cocoa, its bitter but also reminds of being dry hopped. Additional notes of grass and chocolate covered Brazil nuts... The mouthfeel is tannic and sticky, full bodied, long lasting smooth finish. A really interesting stout that will expand your flavor notions of a stout. High recommendation.
Sweetwater Tavern High Desert Imperial Stout;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);On tap at Merrifield location. Pours a dark black, with a small dark, tan head. The aroma is chocolates, coffee, roasted caramel. Flavor has a noticeable alcohol bite, with plenty of dark chocolate and roasted malts. About on par with the oaked version of the same beer, though I find it quite interesting that I did not have this until some time after having the oaked version of this beer. Aside from that it’s one of the best crafted beers that I’ve tried from them.
Sweetwater Tavern High Desert Imperial Stout;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);[Tap, Sweetwater Sterling] Pours black with a good light brown head. Fairly sweet aroma, dark fruit, yeast, and not too much else. Once people started smoking it pretty much shot any chance of smelling anything...thanks Virginia for letting people smoke in restaurants! Wouldn’t mind revisiting aroma w/a growler. Taste is a little smokey at time, a lot of toasted graininess, some alcohol, yeast, and light hops. Decent mouthfeel, very smooth, and has a semi-dry, long finish. Could stand to be a little thicker. Was served a little cold and in a pint glass, so was hard to get aromas. Easy drinking and pretty good, but a far cry from a world class imperial stout. Strangely, this reminded me of Southampton 10th at times...pretty good bt unusual and not at all what I was expecting.
Sweetwater Tavern High Desert Imperial Stout;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Blind Tasting Not one of the favorites at the tasting. Smelled of raw mushrooms, soil, peat, and a good ol’ dose of some swamp feces (never thought I would write that about something I personally consumed). Thick and black, smelled terrible, tasted like watered down coffee with some chocolate. Thankfully the smell and taste don’t match up.
Sweetwater Tavern High Desert Imperial Stout;Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Growler courtesy of wj94 shared at the Brick Store. Pours dark, dark brown that looks black in a glass with hints of mahogany around the edges. The head is small, dense and lingers for a while before leaving a collar and minimal lacing. Smell is big on dark chocolate and roasted malts. Dark fruit and alcohol are present as well. The taste also has some dark chocolate and roasted coffee on top of a big sweet malt base. The finish has a big toasted malt taste that lingers in the aftertaste with a definite alcohol burn. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with minimal carbonation. I enjoyed this beer and it is a pretty drinkable impy stout despite the big roasty profile. Recommended.
Dostal Alley Jack Brown Ale;Central City, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Dostal Alley Casino & Brew Pub;Tap at Dostal Alley. Had the double dry hopped version. Pours light orange with white head. Aroma is sweet fruit, tropical, caramel. Taste is malty, really not much hop flavor for a double dry hopped beer...really strange, also not a brown ale at all. Overall, for a double dry hopped brown ale, there is not much of either of that going on at all.

Finish is clean and very smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet

Big Time Old Sol Wheatwine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;Blind tasting, beer #1 of 6. 2014 bottle. This was the top (or tied top) placing beer of the blind tasting. I have always wanted to drink this beer but just wasn’t getting around to it while living in Seattle. I am glad I got a chance to do so blind. My personal notes mention it was old malts, sweet but not too old. Meaning, I could tel the age was there but I wasn’t too concerned. This applies to the other old beer in the lineup as well.
Big Time Old Sol Wheatwine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;2014 Bottle, poured as #1 of 6 in the wheat wine blind tasting. Pours a dark copper color with no head. Thick body. Caramel sweet malt aroma. Flavor is rye like, lingering booze. My guess was a much higher abv. Sipper barleywine for sure, but not bad at all.
Big Time Old Sol Wheatwine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;Bottle, pours a hazy bronzeish orange with a tiny head. Aroma brings out caramel malts and some apples. Flavour is along the same lines, with caramel, light apples, and bready malt. Well-balanced, with a good amount of sweetness. Good stuff.

Big Time Old Sol Wheatwine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;Draft at Big Time. Pours murky orange-copper with thin cream colored head. Aroma is surprisingly floral, backed up by a healthy dose of caramel and a dollop of jam. Taste: although this is sweet on the tongue throughout, the floral hop bitterness is aggressive, lingering long after each sip. Sweet caramel after acclimating some more, along with a bit of copper. Alcohol quite apparent, and the interplay between the alcohol and hops leaves the impression of black pepper in the finish. Palate: full body, syrupy texture, average carbonation. Overall: an aggressively hoppy wheat wine.
Big Time Old Sol Wheatwine;Seattle, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Time Brewery;Pours ruby copper with decent carbonation and nice lacing. Smell fig, date, raisin, slight hop and wheat presence, maybe citrus, dominated by red fruit. Taste sweet pine and red fruit, alcohol toward the tail, burns on the way down. Silky but leaves unpleasant astringent after taste. Cherry and a bit of ash. Fuller bodied. Not bad.

Twangy, high boost flavor. Quite sweet. Some chocolate, celery, green pepper, brown sugar, and grass. Not sure if it’s faded but this doesn’t taste too hot.

Wynkoop Captain Hickenloopers Flying Artillery Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Wynkoop Brewing Company;12 oz can. Pours brown with a medium creamy light tan head that retains well and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is nutty chocolate malts and cola with some leathery bourbon. The flavor is sweet figgy cola with some roast chocolate malt and a bit of a bitter bourbon finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little watery. Overall, OK - too much sweet cola and bourbon for me.

Smooth earthy and slightly leathery nose with a wee bit of German alt maltiness. Smooth and drinkable with a bit of smokey black malt and clean oak tones. Not shabby.

Bull & Bush Release the Hounds Barleywine;Denver, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bull & Bush Brewery;Bottle shared at tasting. Filtered burgundy orange body. Foamy off-white head. Very nice Barleywine. Maybe leaning into English style, with a hint deeper hop bill. Pine, molasses. Sweet and sugary, but not overly sticky or cloying. Refreshingly true to style. Really well done.
Bull & Bush Release the Hounds Barleywine;Denver, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bull & Bush Brewery;500ml bottle, 2015 vintage. Pine resin and grapefruit hop aroma with a little bit of caramel. Pours dark amber colored with a thin tan head and not much lacing. Starts with a little bit of caramel and dark fruit sweetness. The dry finish overpowers the starting sweetness pretty quick with pine resiny hop bitterness taking over with a little bit grapefruit citrus that lingers on the palate. Good American barleywine, but the bitter finish is almost too much.

Bull & Bush Release the Hounds Barleywine;Denver, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bull & Bush Brewery;500 ml. bottle. 10.5% ABV, Bottled 3/31/14. Pours a thin well retained ivory head, over a slightly hazy, dark amber to light brown (SRM 19) body......nose is resin, pine, grapefruit peel from the American hops, minimal esters, hints of cereal, dried fruits, balance to the hops.....taste is pine, resin, citrus peel honey sweetness with slight dried fruit tones including fig, raisin, slight toffee/caramel, light licorice notes,ending with heavy lingering bitterness, balance to the hops.....mouth feel, slightly heavy of medium body, sticky, alcohol warmth present, minimal astringency, low carbonation. How long did this age before bottling? This is an American Barley Wine. The hops are utterly dominant in both aroma and flavor. Until it warms to room temperature, the malts are almost hidden. The malt back bone needs substantial re-working. Allow this to warm greatly for best experience. BJCP 7/3/12/4/6
Marthas Munjoie Saison;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a semi-hazy burnt dark orange to almost amber color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head. Moderate lace. The aroma had some citrus pulp sweetness and a light earthy spice (somewhat like nutmeg?). Some sweet dough at the end. The flavor was moderately sweet with a touch of clean spices, can’t really tell what kind of spice (maybe that nutmeg, not sure). Aftertaste was the sweet doughy malts and citrus. Sticky sort of sweet finish. The feel was between light and medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Mild carbonation and good ABV. Overall, well, I didn’t really see it as a saison at the time of drinking this but it was quite enjoyable when I had it.
Marthas Munjoie Saison;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;on tap-pours a thin white head and cloudy orange color. Aroma is sweet medium malt-rock candy, fruit-orange, secondary spice, dry yeast. Taste is sweet medium malt-rock candy, fruit-orange zest, secondary spice, dry yeast. OK carbonation. Interesting.
Marthas Munjoie Saison;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;From a growler purchased at the brewpub. Pours a hazy red orange color with a white head. Aroma is citrus and spices. Palate is bubbly on the tongue. Could use a bit more body. This brew has a mix of flavors. Orange peel, coriander, grapefruit, yeast , wood, all with a slightly sweet background. I’m not real familiar with the Saison style yet, so I’m not sure how to compare it style wise, but I thought it was tasty & really enjoyed it.

Marthas Munjoie Saison;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Mwahahaha, David hasnt rated this! It’s about the only one he hasnt too. Sorry, just had to make a quick cheap shot there because I’m jealous of all the saisons I have missed. Anyways, this one was on draught at NEBF 05 and poured a hazy peach with a fair amount of bubbles and a foamy, white head that laces well and is well-retained for a pressurized saison. Aroma is sweet and citric, but a sweeter, round citrus with a fair amount of white, sugary dough, easygoing, pleasant ginger and light coriander dryness. Actually quite good for an American saison, though I’m not sure how much of the Wallonia yeast they used. Oaky dryness is a bit too apparent and harsh, but it has a good texture, creamy sweet, with a moderately expansive nature. Mouthfeel is perhaps a little too aerated/bubbly as it warms. It’s only modestly fruity throughout, with lots of spicy/peppery dryness. Light vanilla and more oranges linger on the finish, mixed with wood and dough. Perhaps a case of trying to do too many things at once (house yeast, wallonia yeast, hungarian oak chips, orange peel, coriander, ginger). I think when it comes down to it, it’s just another American saison that dosent compete with the real thing, but this one is wearing some really authentic clothing, just not quite authentic at heart.

Pours a dark copper with a thin off white head. Not much aroma, sweetish, caramel. A little thin, more hop bitterness than I would expect from the style. Very dry. A slightly off flavor that I can’t quite put my finger on brought the score down a little. Could use a little more in the malt department.
Springfield Mueller Doppelbock;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Springfield Brewing Company;Thanks for the bottle, dansting. Deep mohagany body with a yellowish khaki head. The aroma has some decent caramel with fresh milled barley. There is also a little bit of apple sweetness. The taste has some nice toffee and light mocha. Surprisingly dry for the smell. The body is light and it has very soft carbonation. Very well made dopplebock.
Springfield Mueller Doppelbock;Springfield, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Springfield Brewing Company;Served in a tulip glass-too cold like all their beers. Dark brown with a small white head. Nose is faint/subdued, probably because of the coldness. Taste of huge maltiness and sweetness, low hop profile, thick/chewy mouth and the alcohol is well hidden. Nice beer but it needs a temperature adjustment before it can be properly enjoyed.

Barley Brothers Beachballs Red Ale;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Barley Brothers Brewery and Grill;The beer pours a transpicuous copper to deep amber color with the head portly in size, the texture a nice somewhat creamy light tan or beige if you so desire, as it dissipates, a fine coating of lace forms to hides the glass. Crisp citrus like tones at the front sweet malt underlies it all, nice and fresh, start is sweet and nicely malted, with the top a bit slender. Crisply acidic at the finish, hops are sparing in their spiciness, droughty after taste, a nice drinking beer and one that will suit most palates.

Iron Hill Billygoat Bock;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Iron Hill West Chester;Pours a hazy amber/chestnut with a medium off white head. Aroma has light fruity notes and some wheat. Flavor has earthy/maltiness, some dry leaves, and light wheaty/fruity notes. Mouthfeel is medium/full and the finish is earthy/fruity and warms just a bit.
Iron Hill Billygoat Bock;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Iron Hill West Chester;Dark brown in color with a fair size head. Roasty-sweet aroma with some fruit and other sweet scents. Taste is of high quality roasted malts, but it falls a bit short of being really good. Nice brew.
Iron Hill Billygoat Bock;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Iron Hill West Chester;Clear dark brown, obviously not a doppel. Nose of chocolate, taste sweet, malty, chocolate, moderate hops, but balance provided by moderate acid. Overall impression is actually quite simple for a bock. Enjoyable but not remarkable.

Empire Octoberfest;Syracuse, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Empire Brewing Company;From 2002: I used to work at Empire cleaning kegs and expediting upstairs for them. It definitely was a great place to work, at least from the brewing standpoint, because I got free beer from time to time out of it. One semester the brewers offered me a 5gal keg and let me fill it with whatever I wanted. Well, I went for the Oktoberfest and brought it back for a weekend party (yes, I’m the friend in clarkvv’s post). What a great beer, tasted so amazing that fresh off the vat. Very nice clean and crisp example of the style with taste of malt, alcohol and some great varied hop bitterness towards the end. Went on to win gold at the GABF, and I realized how lucky I was to get that keg months earlier.
Empire Octoberfest;Syracuse, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Empire Brewing Company;Copper orange Color. My friend who works there got this in a keg for a bunch of us. It was fresh off the first vat they produced in 2002. This was my first oktoberfest I had ever tried and was quite a memorable experience. It began with a nice fresh malt taste and then was backed by a wonderfully clean hop flavor that lingered on into the finish. Alcohol did not interfere, only added to the full flavor. Had I not known I would have thought this beer had been cellared due to its balanced even flavor. Upon warming, the beer brought forth some grassy/alcohol notes and the body stood up wonderfully still polishing off with some malty hop goodness with only minimal notes of sweetness to compliment. What kept striking me was how fresh this beer tasted and how much of a difference that makes. I knew this beer was destined for greatness and I told my friend this had to win a medal. Sure enough, as expected, it took gold at the GABF. What an experience.
Empire Octoberfest;Syracuse, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Empire Brewing Company;On tap GABF 02: Watery mouthfeel, clear orange color, tastes a bit too light.
Blind Tiger Tailwind Rye;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;Not a great rye. Light and with a muted spicyness. Medium body with some lingering sweetness.
Blind Tiger Tailwind Rye;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub during last football season. Comes light gold with an average white head. Aroma of malt, florals, and grain. Taste is malt, rye, florals, and some citrus. Just OK.
Blind Tiger Tailwind Rye;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub in August 2009. Reviewed from notes. Pours a surprisingly light straw color with a white head. A bit difficult to believe that there would be much rye in this. Nose brings a bit of spice and some mild fruit. Taste has a bit of rhw but is somewhat bland with just a bit of frut accompanying it. Feel is fairly light win spritzy carbonation. Drinks quite well on a hot summer day. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 10-15-2010
Blind Tiger Tailwind Rye;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub. The body was bright and light hay colored with a thin white head. The aroma was rye bread with some bologna. The taste was largely bologna up front with some rye hints. Almonds came through in the finish along with some raw paper. Drinkable, but that is about it.
Blind Tiger Tailwind Rye;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;Some nice rye bread notes in the aroma, with some grassy but floral hop aromas, but the whole thing is just very light and somewhat subdued. A bit of honey in the malt profile. This is just way too light, almost nonexistent, and I have high hopes, but this was disappointing.
Blind Tiger Tailwind Rye;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;On Tap: Very almost ceepily weak looking yellowigh/greenish pastel yellowy golden color. But some carbonation and a head make it not a 1 for appearence. The flavor is hoppy and dry with some definite rye/bread.
Blind Tiger Tailwind Rye;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;The tap poured a clear, light yellow beverage with a small, frothy white head that was mostly diminishing and left fair lacing on the glass.

The finish was average in length.

Barley Creek Wanderlust Chocolate Porter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Growler from BC. Dark pour, tan head. Roast, cocoa nose. cocoa/chocolate profile, lightly roasted backed with some sweetness. In line with my liking. Basic, straight ahead malt prominent.

Barley Creek Wanderlust Chocolate Porter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Short 12 oz. bottle. Gushed for quite awhile, then deposited a milkshake-like liquid into my glass. After finally settling down, it showed a rather clarified deep brown, with ruby highlighting, overly abundant, tan bubbles and cream to the head foam, and thick, clingy lacing. The aroma presented tart, almost sour notes, cocoa, some light malt and roasted qualities, nuttiness, and a hint of vanilla. Any of the quality aroma notes abandoned the flavor, which was sour, light bodied, and overly fizzy. Thus, unfortunately, drain pour! This was a competition bottle, maybe 6-7 months old, but a Porter should hold up that long, or even longer, esp. from a commercial brewer.
Barley Creek Wanderlust Chocolate Porter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Alright, something was wrong with mine. Had the smell of vinegar and tasted very sour and tart, overpowering the choclate. Didn’t finish it but didn’t ask for another. I guess I’ll have to try it again some day.
Barley Creek Wanderlust Chocolate Porter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Growler thanks to Louie R. Pours an opaque very dark brown, nearly black, with a thin, medium colored tan head. No lacing. Pleasant aroma of chocolate and some roasted malt in there as well. The flavor was very nice with the right amount of chocolate. Not overpowering and not excessively sweet. Some light roasted coffee flavor at the finish is a nice touch. As others have noted, a bit thin in the mouthfeel, but otheriwse very quaffable. My wife and I both enjoyed this beer.
Barley Creek Wanderlust Chocolate Porter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Nice porter with a typical dark color - sweet aroma that has more chocolate than most detectable in the style.

Barley Creek Wanderlust Chocolate Porter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Dark Brown, tan head. Light on the mouth feel. Taste has chocolate in it, some bitter finish. Ok, Tap at Andy’s.
Barley Creek Wanderlust Chocolate Porter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Rerate 2-23-08: This one had a bit of a soda appearance with a soap-bubble laden head and the body seems too creamy for the style. The hop seemed a bit on the astringent side. I think I had the end of the keg or the lines needed cleaning. Old rating: This one was loaded with chocolate with a roasted flavor, some smokiness in a nice blend of flavors. It definately qualifies as a porter but its mouthfeel is a bit too wet for my liking. Just as Rich mentioned, it could use some more body to it because it has some delicious things going on for it!

Marthas Velvet Elvis Vanilla Bean Stout;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Is this the right beer?

Marthas Velvet Elvis Vanilla Bean Stout;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Draft @ Martha’s. The aroma is light roasted, milk chocolates and faint traces of vanilla. The flavor starts roasted malts that give way to a creamy chocolate. The vanilla is really faint and is real subtle. Texture is lightly creamy with a medium body. This stout is good but it really left me wanting something a bit bolder. However, I did drink three pints of this so… it’s good in its own way.

Taste is roasted grains and milk chocolate with just a hint of vanilla. Finishes with a slight phenolic that shouldn’t be there but luckily that was subtle as well. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, light carbonation and a medium body. I could have done without the phenolic, but otherwise this was a decent brew. Nothing to earth-shattering but drinkable just the same.

Rock Bottom Denver 16th Street Wheat;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Rock Bottom Denver;Hazy dark gold. Mild citrus and wheat on the nose.Typical wheat beer taste.

Hazy orangish golden pour with a small white head that fades.  Wheat dominates the aroma, rather Belgian in the yeastiness with some orange peel.

Pours a lightly hazed amber with a thin-moderate tan head that faded by the second sip and left very little lace. Weak aroma of malt along with some very light pine notes. The flavor is thankfully more defined than the aroma with malt, toasted bread, and light caramel followed by some moderately bitter hops. Medium bodied. Ok, but I’d frankly rather have a Fuller’s.

Blue Point Extra Special Bitter;Patchogue, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Huge thanks to cosmicevan for getting me a growler of this. Finally, the 2-plus-year wait is finally over. Currently the #1 ESB. Served in a Mikasa tulip at our Christmas in July tasting. Pours a dark copper color with a great, great off-white head with loads of lacing on the way down. Nice cap and collar throughout. The nose brings some caramel and bready malt and actually a bit of light roastiness, which is a bit strange. Light nuttiness there as well along with some earthy and herbal hops. The flavor takes down the malt a touch and focuses slightly more on the hops. Good blend of hop flavor and bready malt. Light toast as well. Medium body with good carbonation and a very nice bitterness in the finish. Not quite the best ESB that I’ve ever had -- that honor goes to FFF Lord Admiral Nelson -- but this is a good beer, albeit not one worth a several-year wait. Serving type: growler

Boundary Bay Cabin Fever;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boundary Bay Brewery;12 oz can. Cloudy ruddy brown with thin patchy tan head. Smells of caramel biscuit malts, some leather, dates. Taste is overpoweringly malts, and booze and bitter dry on the finish. Smooth, a bit flat and anemic though.
Boundary Bay Cabin Fever;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boundary Bay Brewery;"Draft pour pint at Hop and Hound. Add this to my ""can't believe I haven't rated this"" list. This beer is a classic. A mostly clean copper reddish pour, a patchy off white foam head. I nice, warming winter brew here. Its sweet up front, but its fitting. Spicy and sweet malt combination. Very fitting for the season. Caramel, maple, lingering sweet finish. A beer I'll probably enjoy ever year from now for as long as I live around here. Not amazing, but a good winter warmer here."
Boundary Bay Cabin Fever;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boundary Bay Brewery;Poured into a snifter, the appearance was a dark red/brown color with a nice finger’s worth of a level white foamy head. Quick dissipation. Moderate lace. The aroma had a rich nutty maltiness with some vanilla, raisins, caramel and bread. Slightly spicy hops for balance. The flavor leans sweet nutty initially and then opens up for more of a balance with the hops. Still, they’re not too strong and ends up creating a nice lingering bready/malty aftertaste with the spicy hops. Quick balanced finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fair sipping quality about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt at the projected strength and seemed good. Overall, nicely done English strong ale. If I could I would have this again.

Boundary Bay Cabin Fever;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boundary Bay Brewery;Roasted caramel and a little juiciness on the end.

Fordham & Dominion Oktoberfest;Dover, Delaware, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;"Nice deep amber coloured body with a very thin tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, nuts, a bit of hops and some spicey essences. Medium-bodied; Sharp taste of malt coupled with nuts, and a bit of pit fruits lingering behind. Aftertaste shows some sweetness and spices, but mainly consists of malt and more nuts. Overall, a decent oktoberfest - okay for being local, but not great in the global scheme. I sampled this beer, purchased on draught at the Ram’s Head Live [Downtown] bar/nightspot in Baltimore, Maryland on 19-September-2007."
Fordham & Dominion Oktoberfest;Dover, Delaware, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;The aroma was malty with a light bit of spicy hop presence. The malt was Munich and Vienna most notably with a toasty and nutty character. The beer was clear in the styrafoam cup from earlier in the day. The head lasted well enough to coat the sides. The flavor was nutty and malty but had an odd bittering component that was not especially wonderful. The hops were lightly spicy and just a bit vegetal. The body was medium with a moderate level of carbonation. No real alcohol presence was notable. An ok O’fest and the best thing around, but not something to seek out. 12 ounce bottle. 6 pack purchased at some crappy liquor store in Glen Burnie, MD for $8.39.
Fordham & Dominion Oktoberfest;Dover, Delaware, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;It’s a beautiful beer with a nice flavor and aroma. It’s a tad sticky...but an overall success. GOtta love those German peacocks in the packaging. That girl one is kind of sexy.
Fordham & Dominion Oktoberfest;Dover, Delaware, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Tap the Dominion Brewhouse. Transparent pour of a dusty orange hue. Aroma of vinegar, copper, and spiced tomato paste. Underneath is a thin foundation of bready cinnamon malt, weak and whimpering. Flavors of onion sweat, metal, banana, and clean, floral urinal cake. All this mars a fairly pleasant presence of honey-wheat crust at the core. Finishes with a sweet rush of cornmeal and dark honey. Light to medium-bodied palate with plenty of sugary grit. All the extraneous strangeness eventually wins out, unfortunately. Not really terrible, though.
Fordham & Dominion Oktoberfest;Dover, Delaware, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;On draft at Newtown Brewfest with Stegosaurus and The Mad Indian.

River City Oktoberfest;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);Tap at Midwest Brewfest, Wichita, KS. Pours a deep amber with a sweet, sugary biscuit and sweet red wine aroma. Flavor is leafy pond malt. Average mouthfeel. Good marzen.
River City Oktoberfest;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);2004 version: I really don't know what's going on here. Originally it was virtually the same as their red ale, but this version was very different. I noted their grain bill was interesting and complex with 9 or 10 different malts, which explains why there was very little melanoidin character here, and instead a bit of a smoky and bitter roast note, with few hops. Strange vegetal flavors, maybe some DMS, hint at poor lagering, although I was informed that this did indeed spend 3 months in cold storage. Whatever, this brewery needs to refine its lager brewing techniques. MWBF 2002: Extraordinarily hoppy: spicy resiny hops in aroma and flavor. Light caramel flavor. Wtf? So over-hopped for style and so similar to their Rock Island red, I had to go back and double check that I got the right beer...and I did. The only thing I can imagine otherwise is that they put Rock Island Red in the keg and mislabelled it as their OFest. Next step will be to try this at the brewpub. Otherwise I won't rate this as highly as the Rock Island red.

Clear, golden yellow with a medium large, frothy, almost stable, white head. Sweetish, slightly malty aroma of honey and butter. Sweetish-malty, slightly grainy taste of honey, butter, sweet popcorn, some straw and hints of cardboard, followed by a short, slightly bitter, a little grassy finish. Medium body, slightly creamy mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Maybe the bottle is not freshest anymore, but this tastes more like a Festbier than their actual Festbier, whereas their Festbier resembles a real Pils. Strange.

Thunder Canyon Countdown Honey Brown;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a brown color with a bar pour’s kind of slim head. The smell had a light sweet honey and then a roasty and woody spicy aroma (mesquite perhaps). The taste took the honey and the woody spiciness and let in a light toasted grain and caramel. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionable quality to it. On the tongue, it came across with a light tingle of spice but still letting the honey come in as well. Overall, pretty good brown ale that had a little more going on than other brown ales I’ve had. I’d have this again.

Thunder Canyon Countdown Honey Brown;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Tap @ Brewery. Dark body with off white head. Had a decent malt and honey aroma. Some other honey beers I’ve tried were like stale honey aroma’s. Decent sweet malty honey stickyness to the flavor. Carbination gave me a cola soda flavor and where this came from I don’t know but a somewhat metalic finish. A decent considering I haven’t found a honey brew to my liking yet.

Thunder Canyon Countdown Honey Brown;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Sampled at the Brewpub This beer is brought to me fresh from the tap with a frothy, lightly browned, tan colored head that starts out about a quarter-finger in thickness. The beer is a dark, opaque brown color that shows brilliantly clear, dark, amber brown notes around the edges. The aroma has a lightly sweet, caramelized malt notes to it, which is followed by a toasted malty note. The taste is fairly sweet with notes of caramel, toffee and a honey-like sweetness that melds deeply with the sweet, dark malt notes. A nice level of carbonation adds a bit of a bite and along with a light hop bitterness, helps to balance some of the sweetness. This has a really nice toffee like character to it and at times it even takes on flavors reminiscent of a cola (perhaps that mix of honey and dark malt is what creates this). This is nice and easy drinking, the sweetness does give it a touch of a sticky mouth-coating quality, but it helps to make the honey quality noticeable (if this was dry, the honey character would be lost, as it is, it is still subtle). I want to not like this for some reason, ultimately I do though and would even try this again.

Thunder Canyon ESB;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass at the brewpub. The appearance was a glossy orange to amber color with a bar pour’s kind of slim head that barely left any lacing. The smell had a decent amount of apple to pear - like sweet malts with an ample amount of roasty caramel notes. A light nuttiness tried to invade but mainly stayed in the background. The taste was mainly sweet and bready malty. It left a light sticky sweet caramel and apples aftertaste. There was a light dry apple - like finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat subdued and had somewhat of a strolling roasted caramel apple stickiness rolling over my tongue. Overall, I say this was a pretty good ESB. TC did what they wanted to in this one. I am pretty sure I could do this again.

Thunder Canyon ESB;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Tap @ TCB. Aromas for esb sometimes I just don’t get it. Maybe a fruity sweet malt there nothing great but nothing bad just another brew. Amber body with tan head. Lacing noticable in the pint glass as i took the last bitter swig and ordered the dopplebock. Medium sweet fruit, some grainy notes and medium bitterness. Easy deinkable brew not bad of a beer.
Thunder Canyon ESB;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thunder Canyon Brewery;"Pours from the growler with a fat, initially two-finger thick, light tan colored head that leaves some lacing on the sides of my glass as it recedes. The beer is a dark red tinged, concentrated amber color, but shows a brilliantly clear, deeply red stained, copper color when held up to the light. The aroma is quite hop focused and a mix of herbal and citrus hop notes are noticeable as I pour this beer. A deeper inspection of the aroma yields a caramelized malt character, some raisin notes, aromas of browned bread, bright berry notes, a touch of pine and perhaps a touch of menthol. As the beer warms up a bit a touch of warming alcohol is also noticed. Lightly carbonated, more than from a hand pump, but not overly so; just enough to cause a prickle on the tongue and a touch of a peppery carbonic bite. The beer has a creamy feeling to it and is fairly light, but with enough heft to it to be somewhat chewy. Sweet malt flavors are well balanced by bitter hop notes as well as hop derived herbal notes and some sharp pine-like flavors that intermingles with the hop bitterness in a lingering finish. Caramelized malt flavors mix with the fruitier hop notes to produce notes of berries and some sweet bergamot notes. A touch of toasty, bread-crust-like malt character and some dusty grain notes (especially as the beer warms) are just barely perceptible towards the finish as the hop character just about washes out its contribution. This is quite hop dominated, yes there is a nice malt character here, but this is clearly a hoppy brew. This is especially true with the pine / herbal, slightly astringent long bitter finish. A tasty brew, that has a bit more hop character than I was expecting (based solely on the description, as this is perfectly within bounds of the ""style""). This is quite the beer to be quaffed; a couple pints of this is a perfect little session."
Thunder Canyon ESB;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thunder Canyon Brewery;On tap at TCB - Pours an amber color with a long lasting head. Has a light floral hop aroma. Flavor is nicely balanced. Not as estery as some ESB’s. A very good smooth, medium bodied beer.

Thunder Canyon Sandstone Cream Ale;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Cream Ale;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Reviewed from notes. From my AZ trip. The appearance was a golden and somewhat hazy yet still a clear color, slight small carbonation is seen rising, slim less than a finger’s worth of head that dies immediately and leaves no lacing. The smell had an aroma of a normal cream ale - corn malts/adjuncts - some may say and stays the same smell all throughout the entire consumption. The taste was mainly sweet through the corn malts/adjuncts, no aftertaste and no finish. On the palate, it sat at/about a light to somewhat medium on the body, mostly sessionable, and the carbonation is good for the style and for me and leaves a slightly creamines coating the mouth and tongue. Overall, this was a good Cream Ale worthy of coming back to.
Thunder Canyon Sandstone Cream Ale;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Cream Ale;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Green pint on tap. Thin head, good lacing, light-medium taste. Not very creamy for a cream ale, though. Balanced, no off tastes or anything in it. Not bad at all, very mild and drinkable.

Thunder Canyon Strawberry Lightning;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thunder Canyon Brewery;"This beer comes with a frothy, pale tan colored head that I substantial for a draft beer. The beer itself has a hazy straw color. The aroma is quite fruity, of course, with a solid, though not overwhelming, note of strawberry. The strawberry note is dominating though, as I really don’t smell much of anything else. The taste is sweet and fruity with a solid finish of strawberry fruit and preserves. There is no real bitterness here to clash with the fruit, and this beer is very drinkable; I can see this beer being very popular with those who ""really don’t like beer."" There is not to much to it though, it is light, easy drinking, fruity, but most of all strawberry like. The best thing about it, for me, is that the strawberry note is not too strong."

Thunder Canyon Windstorm Wheat;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Reviewed from notes. From my AZ trip. The appearance was a hazy golden color with a light half finger white foamy head(good bar pour), decent light lacing. The smell had some strong wheat up front like a good APWA should. I do get some lemon and actually don’t know if that’s from the lemon that was put on the side or not, I tried to pull it as quick as possible before it could affect anything. The taste had a nice wheat bite up front holding its own all the way throughout the entire consumption. The aftertaste had the wheat do but is slightly subdued, no finish. On the palate, it sat about a medium on the body, somewhat sessionable and the carbonation is decent for the style and for me as there’s nothing obscure, but there’s also a finishing wheat bite sticking to the mouth and tongue. Overall, this is probably one of the most wheat forward APWA’s I’ve ever had yet still worthy of coming back to.

Nodding Head Harvest Ale;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Nodding Head Brewery;Pretty good but I don’t think this should be classified as an IPA. Nice amber pour with a small head.

The aroma is huge dimethylsulfide with a nutty undertone. The cask was under carbonated as well. The flavor has a touch less DMS- the crystal malt is coming through with a nutty sweet husk note. Way too much DMS. I’ve had two casks from this brewer and both have been in terrible condition.

The aroma has notes of grassy and aromatic hops, biscuity and caramel malt, touch of earthy yeast, and a bit herbal.

Pump House Oktoberfest;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Pump House Brewery;Sort of like a liquid version of a hard Beer-Candy. Not bad but nothing to write home about, this bright copper Marzen has a nice head that laces well. It smells of sweet malt, some corn and cereal with very light hop spiciness in the background. It is quite sweet with only a finishing bitter impact saving it from candy territory. I get some earthy hints of mushroom as well, nothing to grave but present. With most Pump House brews I have had I noticed a somewhat metallic taste, perhaps from the twist-off caps. She’s a tad syrupy but overall fairly enjoyable.

Save your sheckles, folks, this is just a big bottle of nothing at all!

Czar-Pushka;Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Hamovniki;Nice golden color,small head that faded quickly leaving nothing behind.The aroma is malty,faint fruit and a slight medicinal side to it as well.The taste was much the same but i started to detect corn,and a slight metallic taste.Little else showed up in the flavor with the exception that i could sort of detect a hop preasance.The finish was nothing special with the nasty metallic taste coming on and a slight bitterness from hops i assume but hard to say.This is not a very pleasant brew to drink,it's worth trying at least once but much more then that would be wasting money.

Fels Krone Kölsch;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Kölner Verbund Brauereien (Radeberger Gruppe);A small white cover stays over the clear pale gold hue. On top os the usual grainy flavour, this bottle exhibited a rather obvious sulfury character which did interfere with such a light weight of a beer. Finishing not so tight as most, rather sloppy in its carbonation and with this lingering oily/sulfury tang. Poor take on the style.

Deep gold, moderate white head and gentle condition. Soapy washing up liquid notes in the nose, softly sweet with faint maltiness in the mouth and more soapiness in the finish.

Aside from that, the usual grainy honeyish malt, touch of banana, lemon barley lollies u.s.w. Drinkable but not thrillingly original.

Translucent deep brown colour with some dirt-like yeast sediments; Explosive three-finger head with crumpety off-white foam which lasted for 3 minutes; Good sticky lacing and near zero carbonation; Very fragment aroma of roasted dark malt, with banana, vanilla, caramel, sugar, light toffee, light wheaty tartness, light chocolate, strong yeast, cloves, spices and light grass; Close to light sweet taste of strongly-roasted dark malt, with nuts, strong tart notes, dark chocolates, light caramel, light burnt toffee and toast, yeast, low phenolic, light spices, very light lemon and very light bitter grassy hops; Close to medium body. Slick and thick palate; Mouth feel is rich dark malt with strong roastyness and nuts. Wheat is rather less in the mix, tartness is notable but quite low. Very little fruity esters and caramel is notably low. Instead it has rich dark chocolate, and pretty nice shades of burnt toffee and toast. Low clove and spices. Thick to the tongue throughout and I like it!... Hoppiness is light grass in nose, light lemon and thin grass in taste. Bitterness is slightly hoppier than most Dunkelweiss for a mostly malty and roasty low bitter finish; Pretty dry after taste. Rich and roasty to mouth. Comments: This one is more or less in the same league as Fürstenberg Hefeweizen Dunkel - rustic, very roasty dark malt with fragrant estery aroma, rich roasty and chocolate / toffee taste and catchy light hops. It has found its place as a very decent mid-to-top Dunkelweisse. A nice one for my lazy Sunday lunch!"

Elysian Valkyrie Strong Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Well that was a helpful rating. Lots of sugar, malty. Thanks. Appreciate the effort. This one sadly was seemingly past its prime. Nose is soured, good dose of vinegar and brine with sweet darker fruity undertones and those sugars. Pours darker brown with soft red highlights. The flavor to me is mostly brine, vinegar, cardboard, and oxidized dark fruits. Parts of this reminded me of the Icarus that was on tap a couple years ago and how that one aged. Would really like to try this fresh as it sounds very interesting.

Doesn’t really discern which direction it trying to go, but has bold flavors enough to make it a good sipping brew. Alcohol is present a tiny bit. Finishes on a fairly bitter hop presence with booze. Not one of ther best Elysian experiments, but definitely worth a shot if you come across it!

McMenamins Sage Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Poured a clear dark amber, with a creamy off-white head, and a very mild hop/herb aroma. First sip, the sage smacks the front of the palate, with a nice bitter hop finish. Strangely reminiscent of my mothers Thanksgiving turkey dressing, this was very interesting, but maybe a little too different, as the sage was a bit overwhelming. As I have never had anything quite like it, I am simply rating it on its own merits. An interesting diversion, but not something I would seek regularly.

Freudenberger Leicht;Freudenberg, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauerei Märkl;"27-Jun-09 (500-ml sample bottle: Free bottle for stewarding the 2008 World Beer Cup in San Diego, CA) When served cold, this low-alcohol beer actually isn't too bad. It's bready, grainy, papery, lightly sweet, and very gently hopped. The nose is marred by a cardboard aroma that seems a bit more prominent than in the flavor, but is otherwise fairly malt-driven, showing breadiness and some grainy and toasty character. Light-bodied in weight, and with the carbonation on the low side, the beer has a very watery mouthfeel. Golden-yellow color is a bit darker than many low-alcohol beers. It's also fairly hazy in the glass, and the bubbly, whitish head barely rises to a quarter inch before settling to a bubbly ring. Overall, for a ""light"" beer, this is probably one of the better ones I've tried."

Terminal Gravity Tap Out;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Very good beer, you notice a little alcohol aroma , but no 10%.

May have to buy some more and age it.

Terminal Gravity Tap Out;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Undated 12 oz bottle - then again does date really matter with a near 10abv brew? Very malty with a hint of scotch ale peatiness. Sweet yes, but not overly. Tiny hop presence in aftertaste. Head was voluminous initially and dissipated slowly - one of the creamiest heads I’ve encountered. All in all a good, well-priced strong ale. Flavors are genuine. Update: a cellared bottle has handsomely moved beyond some of it’s untamed alcohol ‘roughness’. An analogy: this Strong Ale is to an English Barleywine, as a Porter is to a Stout.

Barada Beer;Damascus, Syria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Barada Beer Company;La pire bière que je n’ai jamais bu, pas de bulles, pas de mousse, pas de goût, elle a même pas un petit côté sympa dépaysante, le néant absolu !
Barada Beer;Damascus, Syria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Barada Beer Company;"Bottle. Rating from 2008. My Barada Beer is amber-colour and looks unfiltered. The label only states ""Barada Beer"" with no alcohol-comtent or something else. Probably not the same beer as this listing, as it tasted complete different from what I read here - I don’t know! Erstmal vielen Dank an meinen Kommilitonen Micha, der mir eine Flasche dieses exotischen Bieres von seiner Syrien-Exkursion mitgebracht hat. Es ist sowohl vom Aussehen als auch vom Geschmack her ein ganz anderes Bier als das Barada-Dosenbier, von dem hier schon ein Test existiert. Leider steht auf der Flasche weder der Alkoholgehalt noch eine Sorte auf englisch drauf, und ich habe auch niemanden gefunden, der mir das Etikett hätte übersetzten können. Die Farbe im Glas ist leicht dunkelbraun und leicht trüb. In der Flasche hatte sich ein hefiger Bodensatz gebildet. Im Glas bildet sich nach dem Einschenken kaum Schaum. Der Geruch ist hefig und frisch-exotisch-süßlich-fruchtig. Der Geruch hat ein Bißchen was von Limonade. Beim ersten Schluck fällt der geringe CO²-Gehalt sofort auf, der Antrunk ist insgesamt sehr wässrig. Das volle, und doch erstaunlich angenehme Aroma entfaltet sich erst im Hauptteil, dort dann allerdings recht hefig-fruchtig. Die fruchtigen Anklänge sind sehr schwierig zu beschreiben - gehen ganz entfernt in die Richtung von getrockneten Datteln. Das Bier ist gar nicht herb und ganz leicht säuerlich. Dabei allerdings überhaupt nicht plörrig. Der Nachgeschmack ist sehr süffig-erfrischend und mittellang anhaltend. Es tritt auch eine malzige Süße zu Tage. --> Dieses exotische Barada-Bier mit dem bräunlichen Etikett ist auf jeden Fall sehr zu empfehlen. Falls ich es jemals hier in Deutschland irgendwo finden würde, würd’ ich es sofort noch einmal trinken! 12,10,13,10,12,10 - 10,75"

Al-Chark;Aleppo, Syria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Al-Chark Brewery;"Rating from 2008. 62cl. 3-3.5% ABV - Nochmal vielen Dank an meinen Kommilitonen Micha für diese zweite syrische ""Spezialität""!! Das erste was mir auffällt ist, dass die grüne Flasche genau die Selbe ist wie bei dem Barada-Beer. Allerdings ist sie nicht wirklich komplett gefüllt und das Etikett weist sogar noch 62cl = 620 ml aus, wobei in der ordnungsgemäß befüllten Barada-Flasche ""nur"" 500 ml drin sein sollten... Irgendetwas stimmt da nicht... Auch ist der Alkoholgehalt nur sehr vage angegeben: 3 - 3,5% - das ist doch mal eine präzise Angabe... Die Sorte ist erst gar nicht auf englisch definiert! Das Bier ist im Glas milchig-braun-trüb mit sehr süßem Geruch, der an Waldhonig erinnert. Der Antrunk ist wässrig-laff. Im Hauptteil entwickelt sich etwas Aroma, aber es bleibt alles sehr schal. Es ist aber doch würzig und vor allem hopfiger als das Barada-Beer, aber im Gegensatz dazu doch sehr plörrig. Der Nachgeschmack ist wie abgestanden, leicht herb und sehr wässrig. Auch eine hefige Säuerlichkeit, wie schlechte Zitrone, ist auszumachen. Insgesamt ist dieses Bier nicht sehr angenehm, das Barada ist einige Klassen besser! [Und umgeschlagen ist es auch nicht, da Micha meinte, dass diese Sorte auch in Syrien immer exakt genauso geschmeckt habe]. --> Wenn man die Wahl hat, dann dieses Bier nicht unbedingt trinken! Aber in Syrien muss man schon Glück haben, wenn es in einem Restaurant überhaupt Bier gibt. Und wenn ja, dann auch nur eine Sorte. 12,5,7,2,12,4 - 5,50"

Al-Chark;Aleppo, Syria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Al-Chark Brewery;Tasted during a trip to Aleppo and Damascus. An average lager, not very special. Syria was a wonderful place, with incredible people. But not very incredible beer, sorry.
Al-Chark;Aleppo, Syria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Al-Chark Brewery;A Mes rate: 33cl bottle kindly bought back by my flatmate Rob from Syria. Very very odd stuff. A huge deposit of sediment in the bottle. Looks almost like the honey stuff you get at the bottom of a Bieken but far more of it. Chunky nose of hops with some butterscotch. Very cloudy looks with a bubbly and soapy head. Bags of butterscotch and toffee in the flavour accompanied by some dusty old tobacco notes too. Finish is nasty and spoils it considerably. SilkTork???
Al-Chark;Aleppo, Syria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Al-Chark Brewery;"alcohol 3 to 3,5% - clear golden colour, giant foamy head; aroma of dust, musty, yeasty notes; quite thin-bodied and with a very low carbonation, sweet with a decent malty finish; more dust, yeast and some residual sweetness in the aftertaste - Thanks to Laurent Mousson for sharing this bottle with me. I wonder if this is really supposed to be the same beer that SilkTork found so wonderful ?!?"
Al-Chark;Aleppo, Syria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Al-Chark Brewery;This is a wonderful beer, an astonishing shock considering it''s made in Muslim Syria. Unfortunately it''s hard to get hold of - the disgusting beer from Damascus, the capital of Syria, is available almost everywhere, but I only found this in a cafe near Saladin''s Castle not far from the coast. Frustratingly when we stayed in Aleppo we were in a Muslim hotel next to a mosque and so were served a non-alcoholic Almaza. The beer comes in generous 1.5 litre bottles and is very fruity, the dominant flavour being pineapple, but with some grapefruit present. For a lager I found this to be full of complex flavours, the hops fresh and sharp, and the malt body firm and distinctive. Five different bottles were tasted by seven people and all agreed that this was astonishingly excellent. Given more time to track down a supplier I would have brought back a case load. Worth going to Syria just to sample this jewel!

On taste, there is minimal bitterness, mostly malt forward and a touch sweet. I don’t get any corn, which is good. Pretty straightforward, easy to drink beer. Okay.
Americas Walter Payton Pilsner;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Americas Brewpub;Pours golden with a foamy white head. Heavy carbonation. Aroma was of malt, straw, and spice. Taste was of dry malt with straw, corn, and caramel. The beer had a strong underlying bitterness to it that made the beer seem unbalanced. Not impressive.
Americas Walter Payton Pilsner;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Americas Brewpub;Bottle, nice cloudy yellow pour with a carbonated white, nice sweet but not the overly corn sweet you get from crappy Milwaukee beers, a nice balance of malt but it ended very sweet. A very solid beer, I would definitely not mind having a few of these on a sweltering afternoon
Americas Oktoberfest;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Americas Brewpub;"Nice deep copper color and decent sweet malt nose. Not as deep in flavor as most Oktobers that I''ve tried, but still ""on style"". Nice malts that give a pleasant aftertaste."
Church Brew Raspberry Imperial Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Church Brew Works;The raspberry aroma made me think at first that it was going to dominate the flavor, but that wasn’t the case. The raspberry was very mild, which allowed the underlying malts to stand out, something I haven’t encountered much with fruity beers.
Church Brew Raspberry Imperial Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Church Brew Works;Well, considering Pennsylvania seems to have half the Raspberry Imperial Stouts in the world, it would make sense that I’ve chosen this as my favorite. Comparaive to Weyerbacher’s version, this beer is more complete as far as the presence of the rasberry in the flavor/appearance/aroma. Not only do I prefer this to other raspberry imperials in those three departments, it also packs a stronger punch at 8.8% ac. Since I was a wee lad I’ve had more than my fair share of stouts in volume & in variety and this one from my hometown sits near the very top on my board!
Church Brew Raspberry Imperial Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Church Brew Works;Thanks to Mark from GWCB for sharing a growler of this. Very full bodied, saly and buttery, with a very cloying raspberry sweetness. Lots of fruits and nuttiness, almost undrinkable.
Church Brew Raspberry Imperial Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Church Brew Works;rich,fruity, think and full bodied. it almost killed a non-beer drink friend of mine :)
Church Brew Raspberry Imperial Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Church Brew Works;Deep brown w/ a reddish glow to it. The aroma was a lovely blend of chicory and chocolate. From the first taste to the last this was a quality stout. Complex and thick w/ a hint of raisins. Nicely roasted and very enjoyable. The type of beer I love around the holidays.
Argo Lager Beer;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Awful beer, tastes metallic. I dare not speculate what they add to get such a bitter taste. couldn't drink more than a little. Doesn't complement anything as far as I am concerned.
Argo Lager Beer;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Flaska. Klar guldfärgad med ett vitt skum. Dofter av säd, vitt bröd och malt. Smakinslag av säd, malt, frukt och vått gräs. Frisk och fräsch.

Argo Lager Beer;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Noch ein georgisches Bier, das vor längerer Zeit verkostet wurde. Es ist ein schön süffig und lässt sich gut trinken. Natürlich könnte es einiges vollmundiger sein, aber in großen und ganzen ein brauchbares Bier.
Argo Lager Beer;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Faires Bier mit süffigen Geschmack. Bisschen Bitter aber dafür lange frisch
Argo Lager Beer;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Barwa jasnozłota, klarowne. Piana drobnopęcherzykowa, obfita, szybko opada zdobiąc delikatnie szkło. Aromat: słodowy, chlebowy, kwiatowy, lekki miód. Bez szczególnych wad. Smak: słodowy, lekkie żelazo, nieznaczna słodycz, nawet jest goryczka, na niskim poziomie, ale lepszym niż w polskich koncerniakach. Wysycenie wysokie, zbyt zapychające.
Argo Lager Beer;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);"Ostry aromat słodowo drożdżowy, czuć alkohol. Klarowne, barwa słomkowa, gruba piana dość długo utrzymuje się na powierzchni. W smaku słód, kwasowość, obecna lekka metaliczność; posmak zbyt przesłodzony. Czuć delikatną goryczkę, niestety ledwo przebija się przez cukier. Słabe piwo."

Argo Lager Beer;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Rozwodniony przemysłowy lager. Na plażę zamiast oranżady albo do ostrych potraw jakoś da radę wypić.

Argo Extra;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);very good beer if you can get past all the crap float at the bottom of the bottle
Argo Extra;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Golden color with a light head and medium carbonation. Aroma of... skunk piss. Damn it. Skunked out bottle again. There are some hints at decency, like slighly hoppy, but they were covered up by the disaster of the skunk.
Argo Extra;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);not bad for a pale lager. Ppoured a slightly cloudy golden color had a some nice honey notes on the nose, taste was sweet with a hoppy bite.
Argo Extra;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);This is a standard eastern European pilsner ... starchy and malty, but an OK option.
Argo Extra;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Plain lager nothing special. Flavor is slightly bitter, grassy and little malty. Finishes dry, clean and crisp.
Argo Extra;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Decent body, not watered down. Thin white head dissipates to almost nothing. Very low carbonation. SLight skunkiness in the smell. Taste is corn and slightly malty, with a dry and metallic finish. Overall not bad especially for $1.65, but not that good either.
Argo Extra;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Shared bottle with Argo0 in DC. Hazy golden hue with a small and fully diminishing head. Medium-bodied. Floral and grainy aroma with a light hint of smoke and grapes, I detected a soapy aroma, but Argo said he didn't. Malty taste with grassy undertones. Dry and soft mouthfeel, chalky finish.

Aromat słodowy, mało intensywny z lekkimi przebitkami czegoś owocowego. W smaku inne niż się spodziewałem, orzeźwiające z lekką palonością, nutką kawy i karmelu (ale tylko nutką). Po czasie można odczuć lekką goryczkę. Ogólnie ciekawe i lekkie piwo.

Argo Dark;Tbilisi, Georgia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Gruba, wysoka piana, piwo bordowe. Pachnie żelazem i delikatnym karmelem. W smaku jest dość palone, nawet delikatnie popiołowe. Z tyłu wytrawna nutka. Piwo lekko wodniste, ale jak na mało ambitne tmave to dość charakterny.
Argo Dark;Tbilisi, Georgia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Piwo klarowne o ciemnobrązowo-rubinowej barwie. Ładna, obfita, jasnokarmelowa piana o niezłej trwałości. W aromacie słodowa słodycz. Piwo niskowysycone, wodniste. W smaku słodowo, trochę kawowej lury z niemal zerową goryczką. Nieciekawe tmave (plus za wygląd).
Castel Beer (Georgia);Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Yellow, a bit brown, disappearing head, aroma of grain, toffee, marmalade, caramel, grainy flavor, wort, malt, sweet, not carbonated, light bodied.
Castel Beer (Georgia);Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Plastic bottle sample at a tasting at Max’ place. Thanks Stas. Murky blond with a thin white film. Very worty aroma with some cooked vegetables. Sweet, papery and worty taste. Light body, sweet finish with medicinal undertones.
Castel Beer (Georgia);Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Plastic bottle sample at a tasting at Max’s place. Thanks Stas. Hazy golden with no head. Aroma of cardboard, honey. Sweetish flavor with cardboard, honey. Light-bodied, flat. Seems like something went wrong with this bottle - very oxidized and lifeless.
Castel Beer (Georgia);Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Bottle in Batumi (from notes). Pours pale yellow with small foamy white head that dissipated quickly, doughy aroma, slightly sweet taste, medium carbonation, thin body, weak and watery finish. Not a great beer, another generic lager.
Castel Beer (Georgia);Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Sampled on 8/3/06: Pours a pale golden with a thin ring of white head. Aroma is weak, grainy and has some noble hops and a touch of sweet malt. Body starts semi-sweet and malty with a mild earthy hop balance. A drinkable, somewhat decent beer for the style.
Castel Beer (Georgia);Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Poured a clear pale yellow color. Grainy sweet malt aroma with some fruitiness to it. Smelled like dried light colored fruits. Malty flavor with tart fruity notes. Light body and bubbly almost tasted like a fruit soda.
Castel Beer (Georgia);Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Bottle. Light gold with a small off-white head. Aromas are caramel and biscuit malts with lemon. Flavours are grain, lemon, metal and pepper with sweet hay and a fairly hoppy finish. Refreshing but thin.
Castel Beer (Georgia);Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Bottled(330ml). -golden slightly cloudly coloured, little white head, sweet malty aroma with notes of hay, dry faint hoppy finish
Castel Beer (Georgia);Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);Well, my brother pretty much well sums most of this beer up. Here are my objective findings. Nose is slightly fruity--almost yeastly with bananas similar to several Unibroue beers. There might be honey hints in there was well. This aroma was better than expected. Slight hazy light copper color with a small off-white head. Smoked toasty flavor to start with a little sweetness in there. Very toasted burnt hopped finish. Quite unbalanced and not the most pleasant. I was expecting bland and boring, but i got muddy instead. This certainly surpassed my expectations though for 98 cents for a bomber.
Castel Beer (Georgia);Tbilisi, Georgia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);"""The Queen of Beers"" as the label so aptly puts it. This is a brown bottle, the only one among green bottles according to my brother who purchased it to share with me. Semi-clear amber pour with a medium white head. Aroma of the syrup you find in a can of fruit cocktail. Sweet, but not over powering. This is actually enjoyable, even if the price tag reads $0.98. Dry finish, with a little bitterness. Not bad!"
Saranac Dunkel;Utica, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;It’s more of a dark lager than a dunkel. Pours reddish brown. Nose and taste of smooth caramels, light malts and doughs. Rated 11/20/02
Saranac Dunkel;Utica, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;A dark beer that is sweet and malty in a good way. One of my favorites from these guys (old rating that I will add a disclaimer to when html is allowe again).
Saranac Dunkel;Utica, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Appearance: clear, dark amber hue, with a good-sized cap of creamy, off-whitish foam. Aroma: soft, subtle, creamy, toffeeish, with small hints of fruit. Rich, sweet taste, with fruit unfolding more and more as we go. Mild, but still flavorful. Coppery feel accompanies the sweet fruity notes, and makes for a satisfying drink: big malt, no hops, smooth, tasty, very drinkable. Doesn’t rock the world, nor does it rock the boat, merely swims happily in the mouth and urges you to have another.
Saranac Dunkel;Utica, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Strong carmel nose. Not a lot going for it taste-wise. Nothing special but then, I’m not a lager fan.
Saranac Dunkel;Utica, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Not as dark as I expected. A small head which quickly collapsed. No flavors stood out, somewhat thin. It sure didn’t ovepower the sandwich I ate with it. My point; it doesn’t stand on its own, you need something with it"
Saranac Dunkel;Utica, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;A below average dunkel. a bit watery which pisses me off....................
Saranac Dunkel;Utica, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Pours amber with medium head. Aroma of sweet malt and toffee. Slight cinnamon on the finish. Two row malt tastes slightly cognacish/scotchish on the way down. Had this one, also, in the 12 Beers of Xmas collection.
Saranac Dunkel;Utica, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Red brown colour, with a rapidly dissipating moka head. Sweet malts and vanilla aroma. Sweet malts with a little bit of nutiness, very little bitterness and little body to support the sweetness...ho-hum.
Saranac Dunkel;Utica, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Deep reddish brown color. Malty aroma, kind of sweet. Flavor was malty and sweet, some toasty flavors as well, along with some hops. Body was too thin, but otherwise was pretty good.
Saranac Dunkel;Utica, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Much lighter than I was expecting for a dunkel. More of a reddish amber color. Flavor and aroma reminded me of iced tea for some reason. Malt sweetness and some roasted notes, and some lemony hops.
Saranac Hefeweizen;Utica, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;bottle poured into a tumbler..cloudy rusty color with a fluffy white head..aroma of bread,grass,herbs..dry,malty,crisp..nothing special.
Saranac Hefeweizen;Utica, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Saranac’s Hefeweizen has a cloudy golden color with a thin foamy head. The aroma of banana is very strong. There is also a hint of spice and wheat in the aroma as well. Its flavor is mostly sweet with very little hop presence. There is a heavy dose of banana and lemon flavors along with a wheat malt base and some spicy clove. All of this is wrapped up in a medium body with a smooth texture and a mild carbonation. Another solid offering from Saranac.
Saranac Hefeweizen;Utica, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;FROM NOTES: August 23, ’12. From a 12 ounce bottle into a shaker pint glass. A: Very fragrant and fresh. Wheat, lemon and orange notes. A: Pours a hazy orange/yellow with a nice head that quickly disappears. T: Delicious wheaty sweetness is accompanied by banana and clove flavors. A slight bit of lemon crawls into the back end. P: Crisp balanced & smooth, light bodied with light carbonation. O: Very drinkable. Very flavorful. Maybe the best beer of the 6 showcased in the Saranac Summer 12 pack
Saranac Hefeweizen;Utica, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Has the requisite characteristics you’d expect from a hefe, but everything is muted and stale tasting.
Saranac Hefeweizen;Utica, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Aroma is yeasty and wheaty with a lemon underpinning, typical but enjoyable. Pours a slightly hazy amber with a nice ivory head. Wheaty flavor has a yeasty and citrus underpinning - plus a hint of, is that cherry, or just my imagination running away with me? Smooth texture has average fizz and thickness. Perfect for summer - or early autumn - or any damn time of year you please.
Saranac Hefeweizen;Utica, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle from Saranac 12 Beers Of Summer 12 pack purchased at Sams Club. Cloudy orange/yellow color, small white head that slowly left with litlle lacing, moderate to strong sweet/spicy/banana/clove/wheat aroma, sweet/spicy/somewhat astringent taste that’s certainly not as interesting as the aroma and with more clove than I personally like--other might be more favorably disposed to it.
Saranac Hefeweizen;Utica, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;28 Oct 212, bottle. yellow, faintly hazy, some occasional bubbles. nose is faint banana pudding, maybe some banoffee pie. it’s not the big hefe nose you look for. thin body and fizzy. faint banana, some pepper. fizzy and crisp and obscures the flavor. not that nice for a hefe
Saranac Hefeweizen;Utica, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Pours not-quite clear honey-gold.. tall off-white head. Scent is clove,banana....wheat... Taste is the same, but in reverse order... Pretty light, not overly sweet or wheaty overall... Not a bad offering....a decent everyday domestic Hefeweisen.
Saranac Hefeweizen;Utica, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle. Orange, banana, wheat malt aroma. Golden with a small white head. Wheat malt, banana, light clove flavor. Light to medium body, moderate carbonation. Easy drinker.
Saranac Hefeweizen;Utica, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;355 ml bottle from The Beer Store in Monticello, NY. Pours a cloudy orange color with a large off white head. Aroma is a weak citrus and Hefe nose. Taste is a weak and watery example of style. Palate is waeks and ends slightly bitter. Not a good example of style. Another example of try to make way too many beers and not perfecting any of them.
Drax Beer;Galati, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martens S.A.;From old tasting notes. Bright yellow gold color. Thick rocky white head. Sweet buttery malt aroma. Soft, sweet fruity malt flavor has a firm hop background very much in the vein of Eastern European lagers.
Drax Beer;Galati, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martens S.A.;Bottle: Aroma is lightly sweet (almost Red Bull-ish) with a hint of skunk and grass. Pours a transparent gold, as opposed to the pale yellow of most pale lagers, so that’s a bonus. Moderate white head that fades quickly. Flavor is pretty bad. Euro-lager sweetness with what seems like an extra sugar kick and hints of apple. A tad of funky sourness with a grassy hop finish that struggles to get past all the sweetness.
Drax Beer;Galati, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martens S.A.;500 ml bottle pours golden yellow with smallish, quickly vanishing white head (no lacing). Aroma is quite bland, but more or less damp straw or cardboard. A light malt palate entry moves quickly to a watery, characterless finish. Weak hop flavor and lack of mid-palate depth contribute to poor rating.
Drax Beer;Galati, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martens S.A.;Light yellow appearance with a decent head. Aroma was pretty weak, primarily grain. Bit of a fruity taste as it warmed, but not enough to offset the lack of depth on the flavor. Thin, mediocre finish.
Drax Beer;Galati, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martens S.A.;"Pale golden colour with almost no head at all. Aroma of pure skunk, some malt, cardboard and just about nothing else. Light-bodied; Perfumey malt in the taste with some bittering aspects. Aftertaste is very clean, no harsh flavours roaming at all. Overall, not the worst beer-but gets too much attention, just for the label and name. I sampled this 50 cL bottle purchased at Arrowine in Arlington, Virginia on 29-September-2004."
Drax Beer;Galati, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martens S.A.;(Bottle) Pours a light golden body with a large white head. Aroma of perfume and butter. Flavor of corn and citrus. Somewhat bittter finish.
Drax Beer;Galati, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martens S.A.;Yellow with some head on the edge. Fruity notes in the aroma, with faint German hops (it is encouraging, when typing in my notes, when I have the same comments as previous raters). There is a bit of sweet corn here, but not much else. Moderate palate. Worked o.k. with fajitas.
Drax Beer;Galati, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martens S.A.;Well, at least I got Romania. Pours yellow with a TALL white head. Very carbonated. Aroma seems sort of stale. Faint European hops, some artificial sweetened notes, and malt. Taste is also fairly sweet with more malt and fruit coming out. Odd beer, like a fruit beer mixed with a pale lager. Finish is a bit on the bitter side. Mouthfeel is overly carbonated. Not as horrible as I perceived it to be.
Drax Beer;Galati, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martens S.A.;"""I want to suck your... beer."" Gold body, white head ala budweiser. Smells like lager hops, water and rice. Strong taste, borderline malt liquor strength. Dark hop flavor. Aftertaste is rough malt and cherries. This thing packs a bite, pardon the pun. Hell, at least I can say I’ve had a Romanian beer. Sampled from a bottle purchased at Chevy Chase wine and spirits in Washington, DC."
Drax Beer;Galati, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martens S.A.;bought for the bottle the only thing I would drink this with is white castles hambugers
Cumberland IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Cumberland Brews (US);Old rating. On tap at the brewpub. Hazy orange amber with a nice soapy white head. Piney aromas with some honey and biscuit on the nose as well. Well-balanced on the palate, but pretty boring. Fairly bitter finish.
Cumberland IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Cumberland Brews (US);Draft at Ei8ht Ball, served in a taster. Pours a clear gold color with a small white head that laces the glass. Notes of crackery malts, creamed corn, straw, grass, sweat, dead leaves, and faint citrus. A little diacetyl is present. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a dry mouthfeel. This is like someone’s first homebrew batch. A little off in every way, completely boring, and borderline bad. Yawn.
Cumberland IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Cumberland Brews (US);Stronger bitter taste but light aroma. Fairly malty. Light. Bitter finish. Louisville
Cumberland IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Cumberland Brews (US);Draft. Diacetyl. All there is to say just cloaked in butter flavor and aroma. Avoid.
Cumberland IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Cumberland Brews (US);Draft. Lightly funky orange malt aroma. Golden yellow with small head. Orange malt and grapefruit peel flavor. Nice.
Cumberland IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Cumberland Brews (US);"Draft to taster. Looks decent; malty though. A transparent dark burnt orange with very thin eggshell lacing. Smells of hops and pale malt. Tastes like it smells with an average mouthfeel. A solid example of the style."
Cumberland IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Cumberland Brews (US);Clear orange pour. Flowers and hops hit the nose. Taste follows nose. Nice beer.
Cumberland IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Cumberland Brews (US);Sample at Cumberland on 9/14/13. Clear amber in color with a medium off-white head. Aroma of malt and floral hops. Malty flavor with floral hop character before a grassy finish.
Cumberland IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Cumberland Brews (US);Draft at the source. This one is very fruity with a touch of citrus, very tadty and not too bitter.
Cumberland IPA;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;IPA;Cumberland Brews (US);Draft at brewpub. They had a different name than what is listed, but this is the only IPA I could find by Cumberland. It poured a nice golden amber with a thick, froathy white head. Aroma is strong of hops, but malts also stand out. Hints of grass, citrus, and pine come through as well. On the palate, this beer is refreshing and crisp. The flavor is sweet and bitter at the same time, finishing with a great hoppy bitter bite. A great example of an IPA.
Coast Range IPA;Gilroy, California, United States;IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;Courtesy of Pailhead. Golden copper with semi-rocky white head. Greta lacing, leaves the glass completely coated. Plenty of caramel malt backbone, except it’s up front. Faint citru zest, seems oxidized. flavor is very harsh and astringent, musty hops and oxidized malt. Just Average at best.
Coast Range IPA;Gilroy, California, United States;IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;Bottle: Courtesy of DarkElf via trade. Aroma of sweet citrus, caramel, and light grassy hops. Pours a bright transparent orange with a small soapy white head. Lots of caramel up front with a light sweet citrus. Piney hop finish is not strong enough to balance the initial malt.
Coast Range IPA;Gilroy, California, United States;IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;The pour is a orangish/gold color with a white head. Aroma had citrus/hop notes with minimal sweetness. Flavor was pretty much the same although it had some nice citrus hop flavor that was very appealing to me. Finish was clean with some bitterness left on the tongue. You could do alot worse, so this gets a vote of confidence.
Coast Range IPA;Gilroy, California, United States;IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;Sweet orange, grapefruit and some caramel malts are apparent in the nose. Hazy golden orange coloured body is topped by a low, fine bubbled, white head that recedes to a lasting cover with some sudsy lacing. Somewhat vegetal, green citrus hops are sharp in the flavour with pronounced bitterness and not a lot of malt character. Medium body with moderate, fine bubbled effervescent carbonation. Bottle (trade, May-05) sampled with beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, Oliver_MTL, Rastacouere and Yowie. Thanks, DarkElf!
Coast Range IPA;Gilroy, California, United States;IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;Slightly cloudy orange pour with a thin white head. Aroma of caramel with citric hops. Good flavor of fruity hops with well rounded caramel malt and a bitter finish. The palate is light and creamy with soft carbonation. A good IPA but there’s nothing captivating.
Coast Range IPA;Gilroy, California, United States;IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;Good solid color, a sunny golden glow veiled by a good haze, though the head retention is average at best. Typical hop attack reaches the nose, with simplistic orange C’s and archetypal crystal malt sweetness. Unsurprising in mouth, growing a moderate bitterness and offering more of the same classic flavours. Well brewed, but undistinctive besides a highly competent light-medium body that boasts a very crisp texture through a well distributed medium-high effervescence.
Coast Range IPA;Gilroy, California, United States;IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;"Any first impressions? -A decent head remains on the orangey glow. -Stringy, grassy and orangey hops bulk up over the biscuity malt. -A full malt mouthfeel offers solid caramel support. -An appreciable resinous hop bitterness prolongs the mouthful. What if you dig deeper? -Wooden notes appear in the aroma, along with bread crumbs. -The tight carbonation is cushiony, admirably sewing the mouthfeel’s intricacies. -This is a well-crafted IPA, nothing more, nothing less. Bottle; no date."
Coast Range IPA;Gilroy, California, United States;IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;A pretty good aroma to it, west coast hops are coming through nicely. Pretty light IPA, low IBU’s, but smooth and pleasant. Pretty nice.
Coast Range IPA;Gilroy, California, United States;IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;Wet lemony hop aroma. Light golden in color with a thick head that last. A full blast of c-hops, I am assuming centennials, wrap around your tongue and deliver a fine howdoyoudo. Enough body to make it interesting and deliver a good product. Pretty nice with a lasting grapefruit sensation. Thanks Rodger!
Coast Range IPA;Gilroy, California, United States;IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;Bottle, thanks to DarkElf for the bonus. Grapefruit and pine aroma with some orange citrus mixed in as well. Very bright aroma. Copper-orange with an inch tall, off-white head that lasts. Bitter hop flavor with lots of caramel malt sweetness underneath. Medium light body - oily texture. I enjoyed this one.

Big Horn Santas Helper;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);"Wet but clean palate. Nice spicing without overdoing it - nicely balanced maltiness. I wasn""t expecting too much, but was pleasently surprised. Definitely worth a try."
Big Horn Santas Helper;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);this was a very complex beer, but not in that good of a way-HUGE malt up front followed by a coffie like palate-finish was bitter hop, possibly East kent or chinook hops-not bad, but not great.
Big Horn Santas Helper;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Medium amber color.

Eel River Blueberry Wheat;Fortuna, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Eel River Brewing Company;"eh. blueberry and wheat can work, but it;s gotta be done really well. this one is just ok. the berry is not overwhelming, but the wheat beer base isn’t really enough to stand up to any kind of flavoring. refreshing, but smells and tastes a bit fake"

Tugboat Harvest Moon;Portland, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Dark yellow with a thin white head. Unique light hop aroma of fruit and tangerine/grapefruit with a touch of malt. Semi-sweet with a refreshing bitter finish. Quite nice and unique.
Tugboat Harvest Moon;Portland, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Tugboat Brewing Co.;This was a lovely golden amber color, with a thin white head, and a nice hoppy nose. The flavors were a little milder than I expected from the nose, and it didnt have the citrusy notes some wheats have. This may be their most easy drinking brew yet.
Tugboat Irish Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Tugboat Brewing Co.;This was a dark brown, with a very thin head, and a pleasant malty aroma. Hops were noticeably absent, as in a scotch ale. The predominant flavors were the malt, and smoked peat, which gave this its unique flavors. A pleasant change, and a style I haven''t often found in local microbrews.
Tugboat Dark Star Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout;Tugboat Brewing Co.;I found this stout to be a lot less impressive than their Chernobyl Stout. It has probably half the alcohol, and is well made, but lack the over the top quality of their better brews. Still, its quite drinkable, and easier to consume in quantity.

Jacks Red Ale;Fremont, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jacks Brewing Company;I liked this but it wasn’t hoppy enough. It was too light for what I was expecting for a red ale. It tasted like they used the minimum of ingredients to make it a red ale. It was good though but I would call it Red Light Ale.
Jacks Red Ale;Fremont, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Jacks Brewing Company;Medium red color, maple aroma. Malty, medium bodied, mother than the amber. Fuller mouth feel. Maltyness shows through. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is malty no bitterness.
Goose Island Pivo;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Clybourn on Oct 2, 2009... Anyways, this came to the table looking golden and hazy with a small white head... Aroma was of floral, noble style hops... saaz came to mind... Flavor was milder than some classic pilsner’s but I actually liked about it... It was spicy from the hops or yeast, but not as much as a pils... Also had a slight fruity character... A little heavier body than a pils... Pretty easy drinking and smooth with some great pilsner flavors
Goose Island Pivo;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Cask at GI- Golden color, white head, nice lace. Earthy aromas, great balanced flavors. Cask adds a fantastic element. Simple, clean.
Goose Island Pivo;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at Clybourne. Pours pale golden with a white head. Faint aroma of european pale malt and herbal hops. Medium bodied but with a slight watery texture. Flavor of sweet and bready malts, pilsner malts, with a tame saaz like hop bitterness. Clean finish. Interesting, but struggles for identity between a blonde and european lager, and falls somewhere in the middle.
Goose Island Pivo;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);surprised i’ve never had this. i only allowed my friends to get this because the waitress suggested it and i couldn’t say no in time. but! it wasn’t bad at all. i even was expecting shit, but this was surprisingly, very hoppy. i guess i was expecting a paleish lager, but there was plenty of flavor in this. would love to try again.
Goose Island Pivo;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Imperial pint poured at the Wrigley Field brewpub Tuesday, the 16th of May, 2006. Unfiltered pils color, dark sunshine gold the color of a daisy’s center. Nice, retentive white head. Smells like rough grains with a hint of soap. Nicely sweet, but for some reason I’m afraid that it’ll make me sneeze. Tastes great, very crisp. Dandelions, grain. Very rough and raw. There’s a sweet finish, like wild flowers and mild fruit. Too bad they didn’t serve this at the game! It’s a great session brew: crisp, flavorful, and refreshing.
Goose Island Pivo;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Clybourn. Poured a clear, dull, pale golden with a short cap of white head.. some lacing. Soft biscuity malts, miscellaneous sweet malt, and yeast came through on the nose. Crisp pils and other sweet malts in the flavor with some basement-y yeast and light fruits. Crisp, refreshing, and lighter-bodied on the palate... there were some off-balanced alcohol highlights as it warmed up a bit. Nothing great, but was enjoyable.
Goose Island Pivo;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap: Poured like a lager with some fizzy white head. Aroma was of some citrus and some grass. Taste was very light. Hops were detecable for a brief second, but the beer finished with a hint of malt and some skunk funk. Thin bodied. Not very good, even for a lighter beer.
Goose Island Pivo;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);With a really nice mix of I’m guessing Tettnanger and Saaz, the hops in this burst forth in what I’ve noticed is a similar-tasting malt base used in all their lighter-hued beers. Body too thin, but the hop profile is rockin’.
Goose Island Pivo;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at clybourn...Poured a light golden with airy white head. Aromas were kinda earthy, with some citrus notes, but overall very light. Mouthfeel was less than expected, and flavors were similar to the aromas, with some hops noted up front. Overall, not one of the brewery’s best.
Goose Island Pivo;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Looks like miller lite--light gold with little white head. Has a brief Saaz or something hop taste the beginning but finishes clean and smooth. Not too bad, but very average.

Gessner Festbier;Sonneberg-Malmerz, Thuringia, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Privatbrauerei Gessner;It is a rough foamy beer that smells fine of some malt / hops. The taste has the right malt sweetness with slightly fruity flavor. Hop bitterness is retracted and unobtrusive and leaves a slightly semi-dry finish. This is a beer that can be drunk in copious amounts, just as is the tradition at an Octoberfest. The alcohol content gives it a little extra power in the taste, and as a whole is very tasty and thirst-quenching.

Pour is ruby, brown, golden with a smallish off white head. Aroma of big cinnamon and nutmeg spice with some soft vanilla sweetness behind that. Way in the back there is a whisper of grainy malt.

Hereford & Hops ESB;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a slight copper to semi-dark orange color with a finger’s worth of semi-white sort of almost off-white sort of color. Light little lace running off of the faded head. The aroma had a decent blend between the grassy/earthy hops to hit upon some nice biscuit/bready type of malts, somewhat dry. The flavor leaned towards this side of what I said in the aroma. Slight biscuity smooth aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Good carbonation and a nice ABV. Overall, worthy ESB of having again.

Hereford & Hops ESB;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Anniversary ESB, celebrates one years of continuous H&H. On tap in Cranberry. Nice people there! The pour is a big alabaster head and the color is orangish brown. It has a wonted beer aroma of yeasty uncooked bread dough. It also has some of that perfume quality I find so prevalent in H&H brews. This may be the dishwashers fault. Fairly malty bitter on the first taste. Barely any carbonation, if any. Not much sweetness is detected but there certainly is some malty bitterness on the back of my throat. I think I can feel some East Kent Golden Hops! The alky content seems to be much higher than the 5% listed on the bar data card. Says the IBU is 52 and I would agree with that. Finish is a bitter linger that hangs for a few minutes on the back of my throat.

Hereford & Hops ESB;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;ESB with generous hops. Lace. Hoppy citrus aroma. The 3c hops plus Tomahock hops. Some balance, but definately on the bitter side and meeting the hophead demand.

Wilmington Dergys Amber Ale;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Williamsville Brewery (formerly Wilmington Brewing);The aroma has roasted malt and some chocolate. The appearance is darker amber than most of the style with a small head. The flavor is very toasty with some caramel and just enough bitterness. The palate is smooth and gives a nice mouth feel. The aftertaste is like burnt bread and really the only negative to this beer.
Wilmington Dergys Amber Ale;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Williamsville Brewery (formerly Wilmington Brewing);Very malty aroma..lots of caramel malt in this. Reddish umber in color with a firm pinky thick head and good lacing. Flavor is all smooth and simple malts with a lot of caramel and hints of vanilla.

Wilmington Dergys Amber Ale;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Williamsville Brewery (formerly Wilmington Brewing);Not bad at all for another Dergy’s $3.99/6-pack special. Cloudy amber red color with a very thin head that stayed throughout. I have to say my first sip out of the bottle I said did they accidently put the porter in this and had to pour it in a glass to see that it wasn’t black, it tasted just like the porter, but with slight more piney hoppy bitterness. The porter does have the slight chocolate to it though.
Wilmington Dergys Amber Ale;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Williamsville Brewery (formerly Wilmington Brewing);Bottle.

Cascade Lakes 20-inch Brown Ale;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;Brown-tinged amber brew with a ring of head.

Cascade Lakes 20-inch Brown Ale;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;12floz bottle, no date, 5.3 % ABV, $2.50 as a single, pint glass. Looks are on the paler side, medium-brown, translucent in the light, and a thin head creates interesting shapes atop the body. The nose is very good, dark, rich malts invoking soil and brown sugar. Taste is basic, but straight to the point of being both flavorful and drinkable. This is like drinking kettle corn sprinkled with caramel. I dig it.

Tustin Blimp Hangar Porter;Tustin, California, United States;Porter;Tustin Brewing Company;Had on Nitro at Aces & Ales, this was a tasty and smooth porter. A good chocolate feel that wasn't sweet. Nice.
Tustin Blimp Hangar Porter;Tustin, California, United States;Porter;Tustin Brewing Company;On the afternoon of Tuesday 17th May 2016 I visited The Tustin Brewery and had one of the most disappointing flights of beer I have ever had. The final beer of the eight in the flight and I was beginning to lose the will to live, surely this beer would lighten my spirits and lift me from the depression of the previous seven beers I had sampled. Yes, it almost did! Dark brown brew with a full tanned head. malts all over the place, semi-burnt malts in fact, giving off chocolate and coffee esters in the nose and mouth. Smooth palate and a decent Porter all round. The best beer by far, but not good enough to tempt me back to the brewery again when I think about what I tried on the day (food was good though).
Tustin Blimp Hangar Porter;Tustin, California, United States;Porter;Tustin Brewing Company;Sampled at Great American Beer Festival 9/24/15. Brown/black appearance. Aroma of dark malts, chocolate and roast. Similar flavor. Pretty solid porter overall, nothing special though.

Tustin Blizzard of Oz Barleywine;Tustin, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Tustin Brewing Company;Growler from Steph!...thanks for being Alex’s mule. Clear amber with kahki head that leaves sticky lacing. Nose is swet with carmelized sugar and some dried fruits but also has a bit too much grainy alcohol in the foundation. Body is a bit thin for a barleywine. Sweet fruit cake, light bready malt and a pretty thin profile overall. Cool name and wish it had more body and depth in the flavor.

Tustin Blizzard of Oz Barleywine;Tustin, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Tustin Brewing Company;On Cask at the brewpub. Pours a clear dark brown/red with a light tan creamy head and a cool looking cascading effect. Aroma is very sweet with lots of brown sugar and caramel. Flavor is much the same, little to no hops. Sweet, would be a good dessert beer. Thick and syrupy and maybe a little bit cloying, but still enjoyable.
Tustin Blizzard of Oz Barleywine;Tustin, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Tustin Brewing Company;Cask at the brewpub. Very dark red/brown color with a creamy head. Sweet dark fruit aroma. Very smooth of course, it had a sweet spiciness to it, maybe a hint of anise, very good.

Island Nut Brown Ale;Carpinteria, California, United States;Brown Ale;Island Brewing;Draught at the brewery. Light brown color with a thick off-white head. The aroma was really earthy, like dirt and minerals, augmented by a little crackery malt. Mineral-earth flavor with some roasted bitterness and relatively high hop bitterness as well. medium-light bodied with medium carbonation. Just a bit too bitter and earthy to really get into.
Island Nut Brown Ale;Carpinteria, California, United States;Brown Ale;Island Brewing;On tap, part of sampler. Pours a rather simple light brown. Nose of malt and smoke. Palate was too light for me, I felt like I was drinking a pale ale colored brown! However, the flavor is quite an attractive blend of malt and earthy mineral that produced a well-rounded sweet flavor. Refreshing, to say the least. Last note: I see some other very poor reviews of this beer by RB, although some of these reviews are three years old. Perhaps Island has made some improvements, ’cause this brew and others really weren’t that bad. . .
Island Nut Brown Ale;Carpinteria, California, United States;Brown Ale;Island Brewing;Draft at brewery, consumed 02/18/08. Unusual color for a nut brown ale: pale amber. No aroma to speak of. Strange mineral water flavor shared with some other beers from this brewery. A little nutty malt flavor, some bitterness on finish. A bit of parch on the tongue as well. Not a successful attempt, sadly.
Island Nut Brown Ale;Carpinteria, California, United States;Brown Ale;Island Brewing;yeah nothing very exciting and very little flavor, a light bread malt aroma and taste, about it. medium thin crisp body with a metallic tinge. its a shame i dont think these guys quite have their brew system worked out yet
Island Nut Brown Ale;Carpinteria, California, United States;Brown Ale;Island Brewing;I seriously thought about about not posting a review of this beer because I thought I might have gotten a bad bottle but after reading Ale Drinker’s notes, I figured my experience was a valid criticism, so here goes.... Clear medium brown pour with a TOWERING light brown head - in fact - the head was so huge that I thought I forgot how to pour or I may have forgotten that I shook the bottle first. Anyway, after the head settled later that day, the aroma struck its first assault. Very sour and very hard to ignore. Some malt seemed to be trapped in there but it took some doing to pick it out. The flavor was nothing short of awful - who mixed dill pickle juice into my glass? Seriously, the flavor would have made more sense if the brewer was Vlassic. The taste was very sour with more than a hint of dill. The mouthfeel was similar to Classic Coke with enough carbonation to lift Skylab back into space. The only good thing about the finish was that it eventually finished. Either this was a bad bottle or Island is a bad brewey (or has a poor bottling line with weak QC). Thankfully, a Stone Smoked Porter was in the fridge and worked its magic soon after this one hit the bottom of the drain.
Island Nut Brown Ale;Carpinteria, California, United States;Brown Ale;Island Brewing;I don’t know what is going on with these guys but it seems like almost every time I pick up one of their brews there is something seriously wrong with it. They all have the same sour vinegar flavor that just overwhelms the entire palate. I’m surprised more people don’t complain of this because I was noticing this exact same flavor in several of their other brews about 6 months ago. I’m not sure if its infected, or sunlight, or old or what. But all I really detect as far as taste and smell is sour vinegar. I ended up dumping this one and hate letting beer go to waste. In the flavor I tried to see paste the awful sourness and detected a slight maltiness. Forget it. I’ve just had way too many bad bottles from these guys. They need to get their crap figured out before they ship out any more bottles.
Island Nut Brown Ale;Carpinteria, California, United States;Brown Ale;Island Brewing;Dark brown color. Medium sized foamy head. Aroma is nutty and sweet with a touch of fruit. A light to medium bodied Nut Brown Ale. Malts are roasty and nutty, slightly fruity. Mildly bitter hops. Smooth taste. Nice balance. A touch metallic and a bit thin. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter with a slight metallic taste.
Island Nut Brown Ale;Carpinteria, California, United States;Brown Ale;Island Brewing;Medium brown in colour, murky body with a light tan head. Moderate citric American hop aroma with fruity esters and light malt nose. A medium malt flavor both caramel and smokey, with medium bitterness from the hops both citric and fruity. Mildly astringent with a buttery diacetyl aftertaste. Dry slightly tart finish.
Island Nut Brown Ale;Carpinteria, California, United States;Brown Ale;Island Brewing;Medium mahogany color with a medium tan head. Roasted hazelnut and malt aroma. Sour metallic hazelnut and malt flavor. The metallic taste is not quite as obtrusive as in their Jubilee ale, but still disappointingly present.
Island Nut Brown Ale;Carpinteria, California, United States;Brown Ale;Island Brewing;Ruby-brown, translucent, with a nice tan head. The aroma and flavor were very nutty, roasted, with a slight metallic character. The feel was slightly thin...semi-wet finish.
Bellows Dannys Double Dark;Watertown, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Bellows Brew Pub;"(64 oz growler - I live less than one mile from the brew-pub) relatively mild aroma for stout (yeasty and roasted malt) - large tan head, slowly diminishing; black color - good after-pour carbo - good lace; flavor does not follow aroma - very pleasant burnt carmel, coffee; smooth palate, lingering finish - 7.x ABV (will get the exact ABV from the brewer tomorrow) - all and all a great stout."

Paper City Pilsner;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Paper City Brewery;12 oz bottle, unknowingly purchased at the ripe age (apparently) of 2+ years from Spirit Haus (home of (in)advertantly aged beers) in Amherst, MA late August 2006 (for a shiny new dollar out of a reduced-price basket) and consumed in September 2006 just out of the fridge from a Christoffel glass. I wasn’t on the ’net when I drank this and hadn’t even looked it up so had no idea of its possible age....it poured out a beautiful thick snowy head, slow-diminishing atop the effervescent dark gold body and leaving chunks of thick lace....the nose, enormous fresh Saaz hops, new-mown hay, clover honey, pretty simple and standard really but gold-standard well-done, clean and delightful....some odd pungency in the flavor and a little more alcohol apparent than you’d expect, faint grapiness but the nice lightly honey’d malts and persistent mineralic/grassy bitterness work pretty well, the body is light but strong enough to support the big hoppy bite at the finish....carbonation, not surprisingly, on the low side. Wow, was this really a couple of years old? A pils? And it held up this well? Jesus H Christ, I guess we don’t know all there is to know about aging beer yet, do we?
Paper City Pilsner;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Paper City Brewery;I think this was a fine pilsner - darker in color than expected. Very nice firm sourdough malting, and quite refreshingly hoppy. Earthy.
Paper City Pilsner;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Paper City Brewery;Light golden hue. Clean white head. Crisp and refreshing hop finish. Kinda thin, nothing spectacular.

Long Valley Best Bitter;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;Draught at the pub. Orange-golden pour with the largest head of the sampler, clingy white and creamy. Also the most robust nose of the sampler, some light yeast and slightly stronger English hops. Taste/body are smooth and creamy with a little too much play from the yeast, and the sinking suspicion that the tap line hasn’t been cleaned recently. Like the hop interplay here.
Long Valley Best Bitter;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;pint from the nitrogen hand pump at the LV Pub, a pale golden pour with a nice half inch of white head.. not highly carbonated or bitter.. a nice lacing with a pleasant finish

Aroma is a barely noticeable hops. Creamy mouthfeel, with a taste of well water that has an overload of chemicals/minerals, then malt.
Long Valley Best Bitter;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;DISCLAIMER: While my previous ratings of LVBP beers were entirely independent, I’ve been an employee of Long Valley Pub & Brewery since early September 2005. I truly intend to be unbiased in my opinion, but I felt it was only fair to mention this. This beer is now served on a nitrogen dispensation system, a step down from its previous status as a hand-pumped beer. It’s also served too cold for the style (the same temp as all the other beers, which it didn’t used to be). Other than that, it has a rich, creamy nitrogen head, beautiful color, and a smooth, yet nicely hop-bittered flavor. On the upstairs bar, you can write your initials in the head, but downstairs, you cannot (upstairs is served from a pony keg, downstairs from a grundy like all the other beers). A good example of a traditional European pub ale from somewhere in the U.K., one of their better brews no doubt.
Long Valley Lazy Jake Porter;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Porter;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Roasted malt, a little coffee. Mid dry. Soft carbonation. Solid.

Not too much head retention, just enough, and the full roasted nuttiness of the aroma is prevalent.

Unfortunately I hadn’t discovered RateBeer when I lived there. I had the chance to sample this at their STL location and believe this is a perfect beer ... pure amber with an awesome standing head and a great restrained hop aroma and solid mouthfeel. It’s perfectly balanced ... lightly hopped and citricly sweet beer on a light caramel malt beer. Perfect.

Fitgers Edmund Imperial Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Fitgers Brewhouse;Nice roasty, smooth and creamy mouthfeel. It’s a sipper but is well worth a try.
Fitgers Edmund Imperial Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Fitgers Brewhouse;Heavily roasted. As this is the non-barrel aged version, it does not have the vanilla-oak character or the bourbon. I do taste some wood nontheless, and some cherry as well. Red win, and a thicker palate than the aged beery. some soy sauce in the finish. Excellent.
Fitgers Edmund Imperial Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Fitgers Brewhouse;Pour from a growler. Lots of this left over from the Skyview tasting, suckers! Why didn’t you all save me from myself? In any case, pour is a dark brown, lighter than expected, with a light mocha head. Aroma is anise, soy sauce, lots of dark burnt malts and a touch hop bitterness. Taste is much the same, with the anise and soy flavors fading to the back after the first sip or ten. Chocolate, hops, caramel and chared malts. Nice. I might actually prefer this the the BA version, though would have to have them side by side.

I don’t like a lot of carbonation, but this is nearly flat. since it’s hand-bottled, I’m not taking points off for it. a very enjoyable stout.

Went down really easy. Finished in the same amount of time it took my friends to finish their .5 liter servings. To be able to drink a brew that fast and easy says something about the beer.

Ukiah Full Moon Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Ukiah Brewing Company;The flavopr of this ale is not what I expected. Strange aroma and hop combo.

La Sancerroise La Sans-Gêne;Sancerre, France;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sancerroise;"Bottle [thanks Ans!] @ home. Weird ""coca-cola"" appearance, quickly almost instantly diminishing fizzy beige head. What remains is a somewhat amber-brown colored headless beverage. So basically coca cola. Aroma is malts, iron, metallic and some light herbal influence. Taste malts, again a bit iron, slightly raisins, caramel, toffee, a distant hint of dark fruits in the background. Overall somewhat sweet like thick forest fruit jam/marmalade, with a moderately bitter touch in the finish. Body is average, texture is relatively thin, carbonation is medium. Drinkable, yet I wouldn't order a second one."

Slavena Svetlo;Plovdiv, Bulgaria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovaren Zavod Kamenitza (Molson Coors);Thanks Jake! Poured into a lager glass, the appearance was a clean pale yellow color. Little white head that fell off fairly quick. Sliding stringy lace. The aroma had some corn sweetness up front. Dry semi-sweet grassy hops. Super light biscuits. The flavor yielded to the corn sweetness. Biscuity malt does show up. Subtle grassy clean bitterness. Moderately sweet corn to biscuit aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this was about light bodied with a pretty good sessionable sort of smooth lager feel rolling all around. Good carbonation. ABV felt fine for what it is. Overall, not a bad pale lager. I think I could back to.

Ledenika Special;Mezdra, Bulgaria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarna Ledenika (Ledenika i MM AD - Bulbrew);600ml pet bottle bought from Billa two days ago, chilled and drunk at home. Pours like a muddy unfiltered beer, aroma of stale white wine. On the palate, stale bread, slightly rancid oil. Obviously something wrong with this bottle. I can't find a use-by or best-before date, and Billa is not going to give me my money back, so my remedy is to rate it for what it is worth: undrinkable. But one day, when I have run out of other beers to rate, I'll revisit this one Rerated on 18 Jan 2019. 600ml PET. Pours crystal clear, brief fluffy head, some lacing, rising carbonation for about a minute. Gold in colour. Aromas of bread with hints of hay and flowers. Similar flavours, quite sweet for a Pale Lager, mild to medium bitterness, thick texture, medium carbonation with a soft finish. Overall, erring on the side of sweet malts, but not bad for a Bulgarian Pale Lager.

Very similar to the Special. Pours clear, light yellow with a thin, fizzy white head. Aroma of light, grainy malts. Flavor has mild sweetness and crispness. Light bodied with lively carbonation. Finishes short and crisp. Doesn’t have the cheap sweetness some pale lagers have. Some might take that as watery, I take it as pleasant. Very refreshing, very inexpensive. Love it.

Pleven Svetlo;Plovdiv, Bulgaria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovaren Zavod Kamenitza (Molson Coors);500ml bottle, review from very old incomplete notes. Now retired. Pours clear, froth head, some lacing, brief bead. Straw in colour. Aroma of biscuity malts with hints of bitter floral hops. In the mouth, slightly bitter, not much flavour, thin texture, some sweetness, no alcohol presence. Overall, the first beer I ever had in Bulgaria, but just another very ordinary, extinct, regional lager that no one is likely to miss.

Pumphouse Kiltlifter Scottish Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;This is a pretty decent beer. Nice body, sweet flavor with lots of malts. Just a touch of bitterness. Very nice.
Pumphouse Kiltlifter Scottish Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Cloudy reddish beer - very sweet, almost sticky - there is a lot of smokiness in this one, both from the peat smoked malt they use, and the phenols from the yeast - however, there are a lot of other unwanted/undesirable phenols as well (mostly plasticy, band-aid qualities) - the strength and sweetness cover these up a little, but there are still hard to ignore - this beer was lucky I liked the smoky character so much.

Sweet malts, caramel, dry smokey beechwood, sheeps grease, some beefjerky and chestnuts. Moderate sweet and quite bitter, some dry meaty umaminess. Medium body and soft carbonation.

De Hemel Moenen;Nijmegen, Netherlands;Smoked - Rauchbier;Stadsbrouwerij De Hemel;Not sure if smokey taste fits to a drink. If not used for curing, it is strange to taste the smoke on its own. It was not too strong though and made it certainly special. Very smooth and nice amber color.

S: Fruity. Very, very hoppy nose. Expect this one was dry hopped, twice. Apricots, citrus, slight pine on nose. T: My nose deceived me. This ale has the smack of early hops, but little or no compliments from mid to late additions to wort. Low fruitfulness for a PNW IPA. M: thinly falls around tongue. light body. dry finish. D: Maybe my bottle was not fresh, as none of the anticipated flavors were there. On the contrary, the beta acids provided in the nose, so, I guess this IPA is just not for me.

Wig & Pen Amber Hefeweizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wig & Pen Brewery;A hefe weizen off the tap in CBR is to be encouraged. Bit underdone though compared to the big german beers. Cloves and coriander.
Wig & Pen Amber Hefeweizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wig & Pen Brewery;On tap. Pretty standard hefeweizen that ticks all the boxes. Slightly composty. Was hoping for something more adventurous, but when you’ve got a drinkable Australian wheat beer on tap, I’m not going to complain too much.

Sweet with clean mouthfeel and estery raspberry flavour. One it warms and the carbonation eases off it softens and opens up more. A marked sweet banana flavour is what prevails in the finish.
Wig & Pen Amber Hefeweizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wig & Pen Brewery;Not sure if they’ve tinkered with the recipe, but this seemed like a well-made hefe and pretty true to style.

Wig & Pen Amber Hefeweizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wig & Pen Brewery;On tap at the Wig & Pen. All cherry tomatoes! Is cool for a bit of a change, but not very wheaty at all. Nice colour, but a bit of a sour aftertaste. I just can’t help but think I’m drinking a beer mixed with tomato juice when I have this one.
Wig & Pen Amber Hefeweizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wig & Pen Brewery;After reading the comments here, I wasn’t expecting much but it’s better than I feared.

Wig & Pen Amber Hefeweizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wig & Pen Brewery;Flat sweet wheaty flavours, citric and banana present in trace quantities. Tasted like a half decent weizen... with the other half water.

Wig & Pen Kiandra Gold Pilsner;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wig & Pen Brewery;Draught at the brew house. Arrived a light golden, with pale yellow highlights and small white head which was mostly diminishing. Aroma was of slightly musky with hayish malts some wheat and straw in the back. Taste was similar to aroma, some sweetish honey, straw, hay, with mild wheat. Light to medium bodied with a dryish texture, slight creamy mouthfeel and a short finish. I found the bitter in the one to be almost non existent, all in all a bit too thin and clean, nothing special.
Wig & Pen Kiandra Gold Pilsner;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wig & Pen Brewery;"Looks a bit boring actually; rusty orange with a very thin head. Fragrant hops, fruity on the nose, but intensity is mild. palate is fairly mainstream but suits the style. More fruity, mild hops. Quite fizzy relative to the other house beers. Very refreshing but in a genuine ’bitter’ class."
Wig & Pen Kiandra Gold Pilsner;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wig & Pen Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Clear golden, small head. Dry and grassy with clean mouthfeel. Solidly malty with plenty of grassy hop character. The mouthfeel is too clean to impress.The straighforwardness of it makes it more similar to a (drier) Jever than a Czech style pilsener
Wig & Pen Kiandra Gold Pilsner;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wig & Pen Brewery;Had high hopes for this but found it one of the few disappointments at this excellent Canberra brewpub. Looked great: clear pale gold with a fine lasting head. But the aroma seemed more like a standard Aussie POR lager than a Saaz pilsener. Nothing soft or subtle about it the night we visited. More like wet dog and urine. The carbonation, too, seemed grabby and intrusive. On the tongue it showed sweet malts initially, with a pineapple fruitiness but the hop provided a crude and clumsy finish. Again, didn’t seem like Saaz. Bad batch? (Draught at the brewpub with omhper)

Wig & Pen Ballyragget Irish Red Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Wig & Pen Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Didn’t seem like an Irish Red Ale when I tried it, actually seemed more of a Barley Wine that hadn’t been cellared. Got a bit of heat from the alcohol that doesnt seem to be there. Light floral aroma, but more toffee malt than anything in the taste.
Wig & Pen Ballyragget Irish Red Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Wig & Pen Brewery;Tried on tap at Wig and Pen back in May. Darker red in colour than I was expecting.

Wig & Pen Pale Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wig & Pen Brewery;180715. This is my first beer from Wig & Pen and it is most unusual to find their beers outside of Canberra. This pale ale was on tap at The Scratch - I think the guys from The Scratch possibly get these beers because they are originally from Canberra. This is a good strong pale ale with everything that you want in a beer. While not earth shatteringly great it is by no means below par. Toffee butterscotch colour with the slightest of heads. Full flavoured with no bitterness at all. Flavour wise this beers probably sits in the mid range but there are flavours of hops and citrus and also some floral hops in the aroma - nothing over the top. A good solid beer that I would recommend seeking out if you can.

Wig & Pen Aviator Doppelbock;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Bock - Doppelbock;Wig & Pen Brewery;On tap at the Wig and Pen. Nice deep red, authentic bock. Tastes nice and fruity, but the typical Wig and Pen flavour really adds a bit of a different twist to the normal bock idea. As usual, not really better or worse than if it weren’t there, just different... anyway, it’s pretty good but not quite as good as I think it could be. For one thing, the head is pretty thin really, and disappears way too easily. I wonder what a bock would be like served via nitrogen? Anyway, the alcohol tastes pretty prominent, more so than the 7-8% ABV would have had me expect or I really think it should have. Also not quite malty enough for my taste, a little too much peach. Incredibly filling actually, even more so than the stout - not sure why. Overally quite good though.
Wig & Pen Aviator Doppelbock;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Bock - Doppelbock;Wig & Pen Brewery;quite an authentic, clean bock. had an intriguing peach nectar and paw paw aroma. faded black colour with lacing that looked like seagulls flying along the side of my glass. very warming and mellow, quite chocolatey with fruit tella and less salt than expected. well done
Wig & Pen Aviator Doppelbock;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Bock - Doppelbock;Wig & Pen Brewery;this one divided opinion at the table. i liked the beautiful rich malt fullness, but hated the piles of rotting rockmelon that come along with it. strangely tangy finish too. good to see an australian attempt at the style though.
Wig & Pen Kamberra Kolsch;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Wig & Pen Brewery;Draught at Wig & Pen, Canberra. Pours pale yellow with a small white head. Pale malt, citrus, peach. Clean, crisp mouthfeel. Soft carbonation. A well made Kolsch.
Wig & Pen Kamberra Kolsch;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Wig & Pen Brewery;First one tried on tap at the Wig and Pen and it was quite good, off to a good start, pale yellow coloured body with minimal head, faint aroma of fruit which presented itself more in the taste, almost medium body, some pear notes and a bit zesty.
Wig & Pen Kamberra Kolsch;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Wig & Pen Brewery;Draught at the brew house. Arrived looking actually quite similar to the “Kiandra Gold”, a light goldeny, with yellow highlights and a small white head which was fully diminishing. Aroma was of faint straw, light musky malt, banana and very light notes of bubblegum, vanilla and cloves in the back. Again like the Kiandra taste was similar to smell, light bananaish bitterness, vanilla in the back and some wheat to throw in the mix. Body was light to medium with a short, clean finish. Not overly impressed, I bad batch perhaps?
Wig & Pen Kamberra Kolsch;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Wig & Pen Brewery;On tap. First Kölsch I’m aware of having tasted, and makes me think that I should perhaps have bothered stopping in Koln after all on one of my trips through Germany. Very unique type of lager, with a lovely balance in its crisp hoppiness, with a really lovely floral aroma anda sweet firm flavour. Suitably fizzy.
Wig & Pen Kamberra Kolsch;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Wig & Pen Brewery;A truly great lager, with a pronounced but well balanced German-style bitterness matched with a clean sweetness in the body. Perfectly drinkable.
Wig & Pen Kamberra Kolsch;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Wig & Pen Brewery;Quite tasty relaly. Very clear and light but still with plenty of bite. Easy drinking means that an afternoon spent drinking a few of these goes by very quickly.
Wig & Pen Kamberra Kolsch;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Wig & Pen Brewery;28 Mar 2006 - Sweet biscuit malt and light hop aroma. Clear very light yellow colour, reasonable head and lacing. Sweet big hoppy flavour but simple. Hoppy sweet bitter aftertaste.
Wig & Pen Kamberra Kolsch;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Wig & Pen Brewery;Not as good as I expected to be, but still a decent beer. Some grassy hops, but generally a weak aroma, probably due in part to the serving temperature being pretty low. I’ll certainly give this another go the next chance I get, providing I’ve tasted all the other W&P beers!
Wig & Pen Kamberra Kolsch;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Wig & Pen Brewery;Not much aroma only a slight hint of hops. Clear amber colour with good head and lacing. Bitter hop malt flavour with sweet candy finish. Fizzy palate.
Wig & Pen Kamberra Kolsch;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Wig & Pen Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Clear pale golden. Grassy aroma. Dry, yet fruity with rounded mouthfeel. There’s some gentle, bready malt character and a decent amount of hops. Not the sort of fake kölsch you see many brewpubs try to push to yellow beer drinkers, but instead a very drinkable, well made beer.
Wig & Pen Brewer's IPA;Canberra, ACT, Australia;IPA;Wig & Pen Brewery;Tasting paddle at Brewery, Canberra. Pours a biscuity orange gold with a solid white head. Aroma: Citrus, malt, grass, mild pine notes. Taste: Pine, biscuity malt, citrus, grapefruit, mango, papaya. Solid body. Mild carbonation. Lingering bitterness. Quite a decent IPA in the English style.
Wig & Pen Brewer's IPA;Canberra, ACT, Australia;IPA;Wig & Pen Brewery;On tap @ Wig & Pen. Pours amber, with off-white head. Aroma of fruits, subtle hops, toffee. Low bitterness, very malty character, a bit biscuitish. Madium bodied, smooth and drinkable.
Wig & Pen Brewer's IPA;Canberra, ACT, Australia;IPA;Wig & Pen Brewery;Tap at the Royal Albert Hotel. Copper coloured with white head. A bit disappointing for a style I love, but it rarely done well. Tart, citrusy hop flavours dominate the front of the palate, rather than earthy hops that would be to style. Similarly it doesn’t seem to have a strong malt background to tie the hops together.
Wig & Pen Brewer's IPA;Canberra, ACT, Australia;IPA;Wig & Pen Brewery;On tap at Wig & Pen, pours a cloudy dark orangey brown with a medium white head. Aroma brings out English hops and a little caramel. Flavour is very English but fairly pungent in the hop department, with caramel bready notes and a little butterscotch.
Wig & Pen Brewer's IPA;Canberra, ACT, Australia;IPA;Wig & Pen Brewery;Cask at the brewpub. Bright amber. Earthy, caramel, light bitterness, an old school cask ale.
Wig & Pen Brewer's IPA;Canberra, ACT, Australia;IPA;Wig & Pen Brewery;Citrus and pine jump from the nose. Soft body with moderate bitterness. Rounded and balanced, but not all that exciting.
Wig & Pen Brewer's IPA;Canberra, ACT, Australia;IPA;Wig & Pen Brewery;Handpump at the brewpub. Pours slightly cloudy dark amber. Banana aroma, ripe and sweet. Taste is also sweet and fruity, but due to the handpump with an usual smooth texture for an IPA.
Wig & Pen Brewer's IPA;Canberra, ACT, Australia;IPA;Wig & Pen Brewery;Hand-pulled at the Wig and Pen. Nice English-style IPA with big malt flavours and more subdued hop flavours than American style. I prefer their American-style hoppy brews but this is nice too.
Wig & Pen Brewer's IPA;Canberra, ACT, Australia;IPA;Wig & Pen Brewery;Tap. Cloudy amber with a small off white head. Aroma of biscuit caramel gentle Seville orange, earthy yeast. Rich, sweet and fruity with pears, peach and biscuit. Citrus flavours emerge from excessive earthy yeast. Dry finish with lingering bitterness.
Wig & Pen Brewer's IPA;Canberra, ACT, Australia;IPA;Wig & Pen Brewery;"on draught, lightly reddish brown with a slim but lasting head; juicy aroma of lemon zest and newly-rolled turf; a decent hit of rasping bitterness; ticked all the boxes but didn’t quite grab me as much as some other wig and pen beers"
Wig & Pen Wobbly Boot Smokey Weizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wig & Pen Brewery;Festering bacon rind aroma with a murky nowhere reddish colour with minimal head. The smell is like a meat driven compost. I don’t get this style at all. I will leave this to the converted on the style.
Wig & Pen Wobbly Boot Smokey Weizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wig & Pen Brewery;On tap at the Wig and Pen. This is pretty cool, and good because it’s different for these parts. Definite strong smoked wood flavour, good brown colour like half-burnt wood. Overally good, but a bit rough around the edges, has the usual slightly home-brewy aftertaste common to all the Wig and Pen beers, but a little more pronounced.
Wig & Pen Wobbly Boot Smokey Weizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wig & Pen Brewery;NFOB 2004: What a delght to find some old notes to add to the ratings. Good pour with a creamy head. the nose is as expected with a subtle peaty smokiness and toffee undertone. While the flavour is indeed smoky it isn’t as if you accidently stumbled across a barbecue accessory place or rib restaurant. Subtle and flavoursome and a potentially very good accompaniment to a barbie.
Wig & Pen Wobbly Boot Smokey Weizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wig & Pen Brewery;Smoky chocolate aroma, with distinct bacon/ham accent, this continues through the flavour, though mellower, with cocoa and a slight fruity finish.
Wig & Pen Wobbly Boot Smokey Weizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wig & Pen Brewery;Bacon is all over the place. Big meat suggestions. Pork sausage ham sandwiches on rye hold the mayo.
Wig & Pen Wobbly Boot Smokey Weizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wig & Pen Brewery;thanks to the chick at the Brissy Beer Festival who gave us a jug of this, much appreciated, coz its quite a nice beer. Smoked aroma and flavour as the name suggests. Lightly roasty, and a bit tart and sweet (i guess from the weizen beer aspect of it). Pretty tasty, but i am in agreement that this doesn't compare to the smoked beers of Bamberg. But well done for an aussie brewer to give it a go, bout time.
Wig & Pen Wobbly Boot Smokey Weizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wig & Pen Brewery;nfob03. duff, linc, betty and myself were given a jug of this at the brisbane beer festival by someone who said it tasted smoky and no one at their table wanted it. there was some bacon juice in the aroma and it was pretty dark. didn't taste too smoky, some faint tart wheat became more apparent towards the bottom of the jug. had it on week later on tap at the brewpub and the aroma was milder, more like honey-baked ham and some banana flavour interacted weirdly with the bacon juice flavour. alright but not spezial
Wig & Pen Wobbly Boot Smokey Weizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wig & Pen Brewery;pretty full-on with the rauchmalz, which is a good thing, only thing that lets it down is the hefeweizen bit which doesn't seem as convincing. dark red-brown, and clear, which is strange. severe bacon aroma and flavour, under which lurks caramel, a bit of acidity, bit of clove, but not a lot of banana, or wheatiness. pretty damn cool anyway.
Wig & Pen Wobbly Boot Smokey Weizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wig & Pen Brewery;This is the first smokey beer I've tasted. Much like eating shpec (I can't spell). Nice but a bit too smokey. Interesting though!
Wig & Pen Wobbly Boot Smokey Weizen;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Wig & Pen Brewery;Not having tasted any smoked beers before this rating is a bit sus. I did enjoy this though, heavy smoked flavours, meaty, a bit like drinking hickory smoked beef jerky. Will rerate again soon.
Simon Dinkel;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Specialty Grain - Other;Brasserie Simon;Clear golden appearance with a generous head. Not much going on the domain of smell and taste. A kind of bitterness comes later in the mouth and sweet aftertaste stays at the tip of the tongue. I definitely prefer Pils and Régal. Edit: Just had another one just before. Somehow the beer stank, I had to give it lower notes and I won't change my opinion Pils and Régal are way better.
Simon Dinkel;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Specialty Grain - Other;Brasserie Simon;Draught at Go Ten Bar. Pours clear yellow with a medium, frothy white head, long retention. Medium grainy Pils and earthy malt, light earthy hops and bitterness with a dry finish. Light body and medium carbonation.

Clear very pale yellow beer, big creamy white head, pretty stable, bit adhesive, leaving some lacing in the glass. Aroma: bit soapy, citrus notes, malty, grains, some marzipan. MF: lively carbon, medium to light body. Taste: soapy touch, cardboard, some honey, dry, little bitter, more soapy, grains. Aftertaste: little grassy, cardboard, pretty bitter touch, some cow fodder.
Simon Dinkel;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Specialty Grain - Other;Brasserie Simon;33cl bb06/2018, Cactus LUX transit. - Odd to come across this brewery first in Gent, then in LUX supermarkets. So far Simon beers have turned out to add quite a few levels, turned out at least better than expected to Bofferdinger standards. - Kurz: adds some spelt character and punch to a fresh allgrain lager. Fresh radiant grassy hops to contour the fresh, edgy grains. Has a certain all-malt, cereal gravity which I appreciate. No Intl Pale lager by any means and much underrated here.
Simon Dinkel;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Specialty Grain - Other;Brasserie Simon;Fles in Luxemburg geprobeerd met LiekevdV. Het is helder geel bier met een medium schuimkraag. Weinig koolzuur. De smaak is graan achtig, beetje waterig.

Sweet with a bready finish. A solid amber ale.
Bozeman Bozone Select Amber Ale;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bozeman Brewing Company;"Transfer from BA review on 5-4-14- Poured from can into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a deep amber color with a one finger head of white billowy foam. The head has a lighter level of retention, fading to leave a tiny level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the beer is mainly of a caramel aroma with light hints of a roasted malt smell mixed within. Some very light floral and herbal smells are there as well helping to balance out the caramel smells. Taste – The taste begins with a smoother lightly toasted malt and caramel flavor. The caramel flavor gains strength toward the middle only to fade again more toward the end of the taste. All the while the roasted malt flavors remain relatively constant, creating a base flavor for the brew. As the nose would have suggested, some hop flavors come at the end of the taste with a floral, herbal, and earthy hop flavor all making their presence known. In the end, these hop flavors end up mixing with the rest of the flavors to leave a rather smooth and pleasant lightly roasted caramel flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the average side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side. The mouthfeel is rather nice for the amber ale style while also being great for the easy drinking nature of the brew, Overall – A tasty and very easy drinking amber ale. While not anything too outstanding overall, it is a good 6 packer beer to share with friends as it is flavorful and very non offensive; good for just about any taste preference."
Golden Valley Tannen Bomb;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Golden Valley Brewery;Keg at the brewpub in Beaverton, 11/11/14. Lightly hazed golden amber topped with a moderate off white swirl. Nose is caramel, light spice, rich fruits, vanilla, touch booze fumes.

Golden Valley Tannen Bomb;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Golden Valley Brewery;Bottle. Sweet malty base with some dark fruit, spice and orange rinds. Smooth finish with a touch of pine.
Golden Valley Tannen Bomb;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Golden Valley Brewery;22oz bottle. Pours a dark, slightly hazy copper color with a meager head. Funky nose, smells tangy and faintly of caramel and molasses. Thin body for a bigger beer. Apricot flavors, caramel, toffee, and a tang that I can almost describe as salty. Interesting and complex, but much better on draft at the brewery.

Nice aroma of brown sugar, dates, caramel and earthy funk. Sweet flavor. Medium body, smooth texture, low carbonation, and a malty finish.
Golden Valley Tannen Bomb;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Golden Valley Brewery;A rich and festive red ale. A stiff and robust nose. In the mouth it is sweet, strong and full of fruit. Long and rosy in the finish. Sleek and a little oily. Definitely warming, caramelly and intensely fruity. Similar to some barley-wines.
Golden Valley Tannen Bomb;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Golden Valley Brewery;Traded bottle. Pours a nice, clear copper color with a medium khaki head. The light aroma is oranges and pink grapefruit hops, very much Pacific NW. Surprisingly enough the hops don’t dominate the flavor. The richer malt really shows here. I think it’s good but possibly a little disjointed.
Golden Valley Tannen Bomb;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Golden Valley Brewery;Dark caramel ruby, small pale sandy head, looked flat until i aggressively poured it. Earthy caramel, young oak aroma. Silky smooth, tannic caramel medium body, kind of works, at times seems combative. Stemmy wood, little pine edge. Enjoyed more with each sip.

Full Sail Prairie Dog Red Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Red brown with lasting creamy off white head.Tiny intense bead. Faintly fruit malt hop taste. Tingly and gassy. Medium hops
Full Sail Prairie Dog Red Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Incredibly smooth is the word here. Not bad for a red ale, although I feel that Bear Republic makes a superior product. Still, this is another supurb beer from a supurb brewery. Try it if you can find it, but my guess is this is another one-time Full Sail beer.
Adler Brau Downtown Brown Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Pours a thin white head over a hazy copper beer. Nose is pure canned apricots or peaches!

Adler Brau Downtown Brown Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Gots a wheat flavor for sure in it. Then comes with a nice but subtle nut flavor. Ends with a little coffee bite. Not your typical nut brown but it strives to be different.
Adler Brau Downtown Brown Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;"There was something off about the flavor. Not infected, but definitely something ""wrong"" -- an odd yeast strain, as others have suggested? This did not sit well with me."
Adler Brau Downtown Brown Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Bottle. Creamy off-white head. Amber/reddish brown body. Hoppy aroma and taste with some nice caramel malt to compliment. I really like the hop character of this.
Adler Brau Downtown Brown Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Light brown color with a decent, big bubbled, bone colored head. Weird yeast and alcohol aroma, nothing real offensive, just weird. Sour mash and dry almond flavors. Once again - weird. A bit spritzy in the mouthfell. Funny - peculiar. Use a differant yeast and you can either have an american brown or a flanders brown. This is somewhere in between. Did I say weird, maybe peculiar.
Adler Brau Downtown Brown Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Brown color, and excellent lace. Nutty aroma...interesting. Nutty taste too, with a little generic malt taste in the background. No noticable hop bite, but you don''t miss it. The only real problem I have with this beer is that it is a little too acidic. I seem to be really sensitive to that. Another good solid beer from this all but unknown brewery.

Church-Key Holy Smoke;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church-Key Brewing;650mL bottle, pours a deep dark brown with a small beige head. Aroma brings out peated smoke upfront, with bready malt and a hint of caramel. Flavour is sweet, malty and smoky in equal amounts, with bready malt, caramel, and moderate peated smoke. Peated and caramely. Pleasant stuff.
Church-Key Holy Smoke;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church-Key Brewing;Bottle from the brewery. I've had this beer many times, but apparently never rated it. Pours a clear dark brown with a tan head. Big peaty aroma with bread and sweet malty notes. Taste is sweet malt and peat, some coffee and toffee notes. A bit thin for the style, but nice and smoky. Peaty taste becomes tiresome after awhile, and there's not a whole lot else going on with this beer.
Church-Key Holy Smoke;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church-Key Brewing;Not as good as expected but drinkable. Pours dark brown, with a medium lasting beige head, little lacing. Flavors of roasted and burnt malt. Hints of peat moss. Very little smokiness (contrary to name). Alcohol flavor is evident.
Church-Key Holy Smoke;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church-Key Brewing;I saw this one promoted by the LCBO part of 3 new smoked beer. Again, not in tha same league as the rauchbier, but not bad. Very dark ale, I'd say more of a porter than a scotch ale.
Church-Key Holy Smoke;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church-Key Brewing;Difficult. Reminded me of fresh pork in smell and taste. Didn’t know what to expect, and was disappointed.
Church-Key Holy Smoke;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church-Key Brewing;Bottle from LCBO, roughly one year old. Be more fair to rate this one fresh as well. Nose is smoky with some raisin notes. Flavours of smoke, grape/raisin, maybe a hint of tart cherries, roasted grain. Pours dark cola with lots of frothy head and some lacing. Taste medium bitter, medium sweet. Medium body lively carbonation.
Church-Key Holy Smoke;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church-Key Brewing;Pours black with brown edges and a quickly receding beige head. Aromas of coffee and smoke. Taste is slightly sweet with a dry finish. There are notes of coffee, roasted malt, liquorice, peat smoke, butterscotch, and a bit of charcoal. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Despite being called Holy Smoke the smokiness is fairly reserved, although i did go in expecting an Islay Single Malt. Having said that i was a bit disappointed in the overall flavour and I don’t think it had anything to do with the smokiness.
Church-Key Holy Smoke;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church-Key Brewing;An unusual scotch ale, but they pull it off. Bottle aged for a year and a half. A deep brown body with a reddy tinge to it topped with a disappointingly thin off white head. The nose combines single malt scotch, wood smoke and sweet malt. Tastes like the beer version of one of those really peaty Island single malt scotches. And that is not a bad thing. First taste is the wood smoke followed closely by the peat and whiskey warmth. Caramel, grain, sweet bready malt blend in and balance the other tastes. The body is just on the thin side of medium with mild carbonation and a slightly slick mouth feel. Tasty.
Church-Key Holy Smoke;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church-Key Brewing;Pours murky brown with a beige head. Has a aroma of smoke up front with carmel malts and grains in the background. Body is on the light side, but it’s stll smooth and clean with a smoke taste that lingers. I really enjoyed this one.
Church-Key Holy Smoke;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church-Key Brewing;A nice roasted malt and smoke aroma. However, the taste is lacking and it comes off very watery. I wish this beer was a little fuller on the flavour front.
St. Bernardus Bock;Watou, Belgium;Bock - Dunkler Bock;St. Bernardus Brouwerij;Bottled (6.8%). Dark amber. The malt character is similar to other St. Bernardus - deep, soft and rich. It is clean and has a salty finish. Really good, but lacks the final touch to make it truly astonishing.
St. Bernardus Bock;Watou, Belgium;Bock - Dunkler Bock;St. Bernardus Brouwerij;Very little head, immediately gone. Dark chestnut-ebony. Cold haze, clearing to red shine. Thick brown candi-sugar, honey and gingerbread whilst pouring, later sugar, honey and caramel. Also something bitter-spicey. Yeast from St. Bernardus rules. Bitter start and surrounding around the thick dark malts in the taste. Retronasal sweetness becomes really honey-ish and something earthy appears. Mouthfeel gives heavier impression than expected from 6.7 ABV. Restrained fermentation? Alcohol impression all the same. Impressive for its relative ‘low’ ABV. I didn’t know the Dutch market was still large enough to accommodate a special product.
St. Bernardus Bock;Watou, Belgium;Bock - Dunkler Bock;St. Bernardus Brouwerij;Caramel and flowery aroma. Brown, off-white head, good lace. Sweet, caramel, light roasted, buttery. Long lasting finish. Like bierkoning I was surprised to find this beer but it really has that distinctive St. Bernardus flavor.
St. Bernardus Bock;Watou, Belgium;Bock - Dunkler Bock;St. Bernardus Brouwerij;From tap at De Engel, Oldenzaal. Creamy head, full bodied beer. Sweet at first, than becoming dryish with some roasted malt. Firm hopbitterness. I''m surprised that a Belgian abbey ale brewer has a bock, but it is one of the best I''ve had so far this year.

Brew Brothers Black Pilsner;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);"""Drinking this on tap at Original Joe’s, not a bad little micro brew tap selection they have here. Body appears black with ruby highlights when held up to light, there was no trace of any cap by the time the waitress dropped it off in front of me. Flavors are very subtle, roast malts, peat moss, mild coffee, and the faintest touch of a bitter hop presence. Mouth feel is acceptable and after taste is clean and somewhat refreshing. Beer finishes mildly sour but the becomes more evident when beer warms up. Very drinkable beer and of high quality, it’s just lacking any real character."""
Brew Brothers Tumblewheat;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Pours hazy orange with a thick white head. Almost no aroma. Flavour is weak. Tastes like banana and water. This is terrible.

Nose: as expected, super fresh hard red spring wheat, lively yeast, freshly but grass. Taste: Medium-light sweet, light bitter, light sour. A healthy serving of orange citrus and a delicious but mellow custard taste late. Thumbs up.

Brew Brothers Tumblewheat;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Sample at Calgary beerfest. Deep golden, slightly hazy. Odd aroma of sweet esters that actually is offputting, synthetic almost. Overly sweet palate with a wheaty profile and a creamy mouthfeel, but ruined by a corn-syrup dominated flavour. More like a cream ale than anything, and certainly NOT like a pilsner! I didn’t care for it at all.
Brew Brothers Tumblewheat;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);GCBF. Nice corn chip color with a stratified haze. Not cloudy so much as hazy. A spicy smelling but thin head floated in chunks. Mouthfeel was a bit strange, almost oily. The beer was too sweet for me, with minimal hop bittering, but a citrus lemon flavour and grassy overtones finishing the beer. Ok, but not in my top 100 crystal (hahaha) weizens.
Brew Brothers Tumblewheat;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Hazy yellow coulour, with some grassy whaeat aroma. The beer as a nice tartness, and almost a candy sweetness, with a light bitterness in after taste. Ok for the style
Brew Brothers Ambush IPA;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;IPA;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Came from a 1.89L bottle for $15 Canadian. Poured a small head that faded fast. No lacing. A few bubbles coming up 15 minutes later. Tastes like a beginners IPA. Some bitterness. Carmel, grassy. Medium sweetness. Nothing Horrible, nothing great. Refills of the 1.89L bottle are $10. On their website they no longer call it an IPA
Brew Brothers Ambush IPA;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;IPA;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Cask at Calgary International Beer Fest. Pours lightly hazy copper with a medium, bubbly white head, medium retention with good lacing. Aroma is pine, citrus, and herbal hops with pineapple and peach esters and biscuit malt. Flavor is sweet malt, medium hops and bitterness, light fruity esters and a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.
Brew Brothers Ambush IPA;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;IPA;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);1L swingtop bottle poured slightly hazy light amber color with moderate off-white head. Aromas of fresh hops and some caramel. Taste is unique for an IPA with some earthy and malt sweetness that does not show up in most IPA’s. The finish is a pleasing bitterness that is not over the top. Overall, a milder IPA with enough flavor to tantalize the tastebuds.
Brew Brothers Ambush IPA;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;IPA;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Mason jar of this on tap at Amsterdam Rhino pub in Calgary, AB on 07/02/2011. Colour: Dark orange with little to no head. Nose: Common to Brew Bros beers, a strong grain presence - grass too. A smattering of dishwater, some mild baked apple. Taste: Medium-light sweet, medium-light bitter, light sour. Citrus hops come on strong then mellow cake in the middle. Finish turns nutty. Neat stuff.
Brew Brothers Ambush IPA;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;IPA;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Bottle is most likely 2 years old. A dark amber IPA with a thick collapsing moka head. Aroma is quite interesting, veering on barley wine territory, with fine maderization, some hops remnants, quite nice. In mouth, this is a rather sweet interpretation of the style, with honey, light lactic points, some corn syrup. Based on other ratings, I read that this one was sweet to start with.....cant remember if igot this in a trade (from Kris or Trev) or when i was in AB last time.
Brew Brothers Ambush IPA;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;IPA;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);From a bottle. Very little head/carbonation. A little sweeter tasting than the typical IPA - not your typical cascadian bitter taste (which I prefer).
Brew Brothers Ambush IPA;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;IPA;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);***review from Dec 24, 2007*** Amber brew with a good ammount of unfilteredness, produced a huge off-white to tan head that has simmered to a skim and leaves some thin, messy lacing. Lacks in aroma but what is there is nice and mild for once. Floral hops with a touch of citrus, light biscuity and lighter caramel malts. A bit weak but from time to time it’s a good change of pace from the hop bombs and the aroma here is decent enough. The taste is better now that it’s warmer as the hops and their stiffness and weak pinyness comes out swinging. Zero grapefruit or other strong related citrus fruits that are so common. Some malt backbone...actually more than just some. Mouthfeel is thinner than I’m used to. Breathing in some harshness (good!). Finishes with a so-so bitter taste...but it’s got legs. A good change up from a hop pounding. I’ll get this again me thinks.
Brew Brothers Ambush IPA;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;IPA;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Pours a light amber colour... pretty good hop character, with a bit of sweetness from hops. Kind of different flavour than you’de expect from an IPA but good in it’s own right.
Brew Brothers Ambush IPA;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;IPA;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Draught at Ship and Anchor, Calgary Light amber color. How many boring Amber Ales did I have tonight? This one has a light cocoa powder flavor and a lightly round body, but still quite boring after the first half pint.
Brew Brothers Ambush IPA;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;IPA;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);[826-20071105] Tap @ Amsterdam Rhino (Calgary, AB). Grainy hay malt aroma has a bit of sweet caramel. Clear, amber orange body with a medium-lasting foamy off-white head. Grainy sweet yeast flavour is thick with toffee and caramel notes. Medium body. Nice but a little grainy.
Brew Brothers Prairie Steamer;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);1L swingtop bottle poured amber in color with modest off-white head and some fine lacing. Aromas of caramel and some herbs. Taste is nice malty sweetness with some herbal hops in the finish. A rather enjoyable beer which is fairly easy to drink.
Brew Brothers Prairie Steamer;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Draught at Hop In, Calgary, AB, Canada. Clear pale golden colour tiny to small white head. Grainy cereal malty aroma with mild notes of hops. Grassy hoppy with some stinging bitterness in aftertaste. Slightly thin.
Brew Brothers Prairie Steamer;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);"Had it on tap at District in Calgary. They call it ""Gonzo"", not Prairie Steamer but its apparently the same beer. Fairly dark with nose of sweet caramel and herbs. Sweet taste with a generous portion of vanilla and caramel. A nice malty background added balance. Creamy palate and the finish was again caramely. Should have been too sweet for my general liking but it never became too much."
Brew Brothers Prairie Steamer;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Pouring with a moderate foamy white head which shrank away to a thin layer in short order, this one’s colour was an attractive dark amber, and cloudy to boot. The aroma was only a bit of malt, and at first the taste was ’odd’ to say the least. However, after allowing the beer to ’breathe’ in the glass for a few minutes, it did indeed taste like an amber ale and quite a nice one at that. Mouthfeel and aftertaste were quite acceptable. Kudos for the one litre swing top bottle.
Brew Brothers Prairie Steamer;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Clear copper amber, moderate foamy head. Caramel and vaguely fruity aroma. Sweet caramel malt, creamy mouthfeel. A little too much sweetness for me after a while-- I’m glad I shared this one. Not bad.
Brew Brothers Prairie Steamer;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);(1 litre bottle) Pours a large, beige, non-dissipating head and a deep brown body. Nose of tart hops. SOUR! Oh, so sour. Hoppy and yeasty. Likely spoiled...
Brew Brothers Prairie Steamer;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Sweet malt and caramel, light smoke and organic notes underneath a bright copper color and bubbly, light colored head. Sweet body, brown sugar, almost cloying at the front. Gets into some organic, light hops, hints of yeast as well.
Brew Brothers Prairie Steamer;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Copper amber look, bright white head. Nice classy looking beer . Malt base, lighter aroma. Clean light body, refreshing, slightly to thin for strong ale, woody.
Brew Brothers Prairie Steamer;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Candied malt aroma, copper, small vanilla custard head. Malt with some woodiness. Thin, fair.
Brew Brothers Prairie Steamer;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Brew Brothers Brewing (Alberta);Amber w/ off white head. Malty aroma of caramel & oranges. Sticky, medium body. Peppery flavour of caramel, brown sugar, oranges & light hops.
Chelsea Henry Hudson IPA;Bronx, New York, United States;IPA;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;On tap at the Gingerman when I stopped in with Joe after Paul’s tasting. Pours a ruby brown, clear, with a thin white head. Malt, caramel, hoppy citrus. Sweet and earthy. Earthy malt, spicy hops, leading into a big bitter grapefruit and quinine finish.
Chelsea Henry Hudson IPA;Bronx, New York, United States;IPA;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;had at the brewery in Chelsea Piers. all i remember is that i loved this IPA
Chelsea Henry Hudson IPA;Bronx, New York, United States;IPA;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;"(Old BA rate - tap) Poured with a coppery orange hue; not bad half-finger of off-white head. Grapefruit and candy aroma; touch of sweet maltiness. Hop bitterness does come through well at first, but then followed by a fairly sweet malt backing that lent itself to a candy-like flavor to me. Medium MF; softish carbonation but quite alright. Decent, not a bad brew but just not the easiest in the style to drink. Overall, just a tad too sweet for my liking, but a not bad brew."
Chelsea Henry Hudson IPA;Bronx, New York, United States;IPA;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Tap @ Boston/NY 2009. Soft fruity nose, grapefruit, citrussy. Soft balanced taste, very nice bitter. Slight dry finish. Brewer kept on pouring this stuff and its exceptionally drinkable, showing he sure knows how to brew a nice beer.
Chelsea Henry Hudson IPA;Bronx, New York, United States;IPA;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;On tap at the Ginger Man in NYC. Wish I could have gone to the brewery. Had low expectations, but was happily surprised.
Chelsea Henry Hudson IPA;Bronx, New York, United States;IPA;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Draught on 22nd July 2009 at Mugs Alehouse, Brooklyn, NYC. Golden with white head. excellently hoppy and refreshing with some citricity.
Chelsea Henry Hudson IPA;Bronx, New York, United States;IPA;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Draft. Pours golden orange with a white head. Light floral hoppy aroma with some lightly sweet malt notes. The flavor is fairly well balanced, and has sweeter malts with floral/citric hops. Refreshing.
Chelsea Henry Hudson IPA;Bronx, New York, United States;IPA;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Tap @ Rattle ’N’ Hum. Amber pour with white foam. Hoppy aroma. Flavor seemed to be off, malt character was too strong for me in an IPA.
Chelsea Henry Hudson IPA;Bronx, New York, United States;IPA;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Draft. Pours a copper orange body with a white head. Orange citrus notes with a hint of pear and tangerines. Spicy hop resins with grapefruit and a nutty but candi like fruit. Not bad.

Fine lace.3+ Nose: rich , sweet malts as base , sweet fruits ,citrus aroma. Hint of grapefruit. Refreshing Flavor/Palate : Mid full bodied. Good leafy green hop character. Straight leafy IPA. Some sticky malts at finish.
Chelsea Autumn Harvest Amber Wheat;Bronx, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;nice brew light golden and full of wheat flavor. easy on the banana and clove flavor which i appreciate. nice moderate enough body and sparkle in the carbonation while still frothy and smooth. a little noticeable hop.
Chelsea Autumn Harvest Amber Wheat;Bronx, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;(Old BA rate - tap) Light coppery color, and poured (poorly by the bartender) with barely any of the seemingly white head. Light yeasty and wheat aromas. Faint banana and clove as well. Wheatiness is definitely there followed up by a raw grain (in a good way) and not nearly as fruity as suggested by the aroma. Thinnish MF, and I would have expected a bit more of a bubbly factor, but this didn’t kill the MF for me. Light and refreshing even though it’s a darker wheat style. Very quaffable, and I really went through this sample quickly.
Chelsea Autumn Harvest Amber Wheat;Bronx, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Draught at Barcade, New York Muddy amber color. Poor aroma and flavor. Sorry, there is not much to say about this besides that it has a good body structure.
Chelsea Autumn Harvest Amber Wheat;Bronx, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Tap at Barcade: Cloudy deep orange with ample creamy head. The aroma has a musty yeast character, along with more crisp citrus notes as well. Has an easy going flavor. The wheat malt is evident giving it a lightly tart smooth body and a very subtle grassy citrus finish. Simple, but smooth and sessionable.
Chelsea Autumn Harvest Amber Wheat;Bronx, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;"Draught at Brazen Head. Listed simply as ""Autumn Amber."" Poured an amber color with a thin off-white head. Malty and somewhat fruity and floral aroma. Moderate caramel/cereal malts in the initial flavor cut abruptly by a dry and carbonic finish. Seems overly fizzed. Settles a bit to reveal an earthy and spicy character, with a body of toasty and slightly sweet cereal malts. Not bad, but nothing striking overall."
Chelsea Autumn Harvest Amber Wheat;Bronx, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Hazy amber with a thick massive off-white head. The aroma is very wheaty with bright wheaty spiciness over a softly bready malt base. A touch of munich malt adds some nice complexity to something that might have been uninteresting. Very clean yeast unfortunately, with only a touch of bubble gum character coming through. Flavour has soft wheaty spice, a touch of black pepper (not ethanol) and a crisp noble hop flavour on the finish. Quite minerally as well which helps crispen the finish. Very refreshing pint… get a Belgian yeast of some sort in here and this could be something special.
Chelsea Autumn Harvest Amber Wheat;Bronx, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;(tap at Gingerman) Slighly cloudy copper with a big off-white head. Aroma is roasted malt with herbs and soft spices. Taste has toasted wheat bread, light caramel, more hay/straw, some herbs. Finish is short with almost no bitterness. This is an excellent light session beer with the wheat/caramel duo as the main attraction. Caramelised but without loosing its crisp wheaty body. Something I wish I could drink on a regular basis. Having walked downtown New York on a number of occasions I thought that the Chelsea Autumn Harvest consisted of gathering used condoms and needles from the West Side Manhattan sidewalks before winter.
Chelsea Autumn Harvest Amber Wheat;Bronx, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Any first impressions? -A gorgeous head resides atop the hazy pale auburn. -Dry bread crumbs and toasted cereals increase my nostrils’ level of curiosity. -Flavors are mostly about the malts, as an important loaf of bread brings sustenance and subtle dryness. -The smooth carbonation and well-nourished maltiness produce a very quenching beer. What if you dig deeper? -The finish is dry and shy, somewhat of a disappointment. -There is some minute fruitiness to be found around the bread. -This is a one-trick pony, but it serves its purpose very well as a malty session beer. On tap at Gingerman, Manhattan.
Chelsea Autumn Harvest Amber Wheat;Bronx, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;You wouldn't know it's a wheat. Disappointing. Mild hint of bitterness, but otherwise it tastes like a non-wheaty ale. How underwhelmed I am.
Chelsea Boo! Berry Wheat;Bronx, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Hazy, honey gold, white head. Yeasty blueberry aroma- not overwhelming. The flavor was a bit meaty somehow and slightly spicy, almost put me in the mind of corned beef or salami. Definite black pepper flavors in the profile. A bit flat and watery. Finish is quick. Very light sweetness. Light hopping. An odd brew. Blueberries muted in the profile.
Chelsea Boo! Berry Wheat;Bronx, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;"The brewpub rotates its selection of fruit wheats, but they all use the same wheat base (which is also offered on the regular menu). The ""Boo!"" name was used for Halloween, but I had mine in May with regular label of ""Blueberry Wheat"". Hazy copper, light at the edge, a bit of blueberry aroma and flavor. It lets the wheat come through with a bit of bitterness in there, though it doesn't thrill compared to other blueberries (and I have in mind the Boston Beer Works up the coast)."
Chelsea Boo! Berry Wheat;Bronx, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;It''s SCARY how thin the blueberry taste is in this beer. Having tried great blueberry beers like Marin Bluebeery Ale, I can spot a cheap imitation when I see one. A bit bitter, too.
Chelsea Cream Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Growler sample shared by a local BA from notes. Pours dark brown to black in color with a small beige head. The aroma and flavor had roasted malts, dark chocolate, a splash of caramel sweetness is mild, good body and mouth feel, dry, roasted bitterness to the finish. Pretty solid.
Chelsea Cream Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;"(Old BA rate - cask) Dense, dark black color and poured with a really decent light tan head that was a specific surprise given that this was cask offering. Roasty as hell for the style, which was quite nice as it cut some of the sweetness; dark, rich maltiness; touch smokey in the aroma. Roasted maltiness way out front; tasty bitterness (not hoppy); light chocolate sweetness. Thicker MF overall; very subtle carbonation (cask). Decent and tasty"
Chelsea Cream Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Draft @ Coles, Buffalo. Chelsea can sure make great stouts. Deep dark pour. Dark tan head.Deep roasted malt aroma, hints of chocolate, cocoa. Flavor is dark roasted, almost burnt malts, chocolate, light hint of vanilla. Full thick mouthfeel. Another winnning stout from Chelsea
Chelsea Cream Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Enjoyed on-tap at Cole’s. Surprising bold flavours from this brewpub. Chocolate aromas, with a little coconut - as if barrel-aged. Above-average mouthfeel, creamy with chocolate, some lactate, like a latte but more on the thick chocolate side. Roasty. Like a nitro, but not, and some complex tasty stuff. A meal.
Chelsea Cream Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Tap, Cole’s. Body is black, tan head. Nose is delicious caramel, cocoa, roasty malt, honey & milky caramel. Flavor is cocoa, caramel, slightly tart/burnt, vanilla. A bit of tingy hop towards the finish. Lingering roast. You could tell me that this was a Bells beer & I’d believe you.
Chelsea Cream Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Growler sample from Ben. Poured black color with a minimal creamy brown head that mostly diminished with virtually no lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted chocolate malt aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy toasted sweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration. My expectations where met with solid drinkable beer.
Chelsea Cream Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;"Cask at Ginger Man, NYC Black color. Dusty aroma of roasted malt. Medium body, dark chocolate flavor, caramel, residual sweetness, liquorice, a bit salty; lightly creamy. Good."
Chelsea Cream Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Cask ginger Man - nice look, great head - coffee and coca liquor aromas, taste some earthy mineral and dark berry fruit, hops are totally dry, I find this on the verge of being sweet. Very balanced with the light carbonation.
Chelsea Cream Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Cask. Pours near black with a tan head. Roasted malty aroma with some awesome creamy notes of french vanilla. The flavor brings more roast, with chocolate, lighter vanilla, and a hint of molasses.
Chelsea Cream Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Dark black with a small head. Aroma has a ton of coffee and roasted malts. Flavor has some sweetness but is dominated by coffee and dark bittersweet roasted malts.

Pipkin Porter;La Grange, Kentucky, United States;Porter;Pipkin Brewing Co.;Translucent dark brown with a ring of white bubbles. HUGE molasses aroma backed by milk choc., with a touch of cocoa and dark choc., some toast as well. Also a serious load of lighter malts, cake, and caramel. Slight sweet with an almost bitter finish. Awsome porter!

Pipkin Porter;La Grange, Kentucky, United States;Porter;Pipkin Brewing Co.;Bottled, thanks hopsrus!! Black as tar. Asphalt aroma, the way it smells when the first drops of rain falls on hot, dusty asphalt. Very dry, yet velvetty smooth. Lighlty roasty and with notes of salty licorice in the finish. Balanced bitterness.
Pipkin Porter;La Grange, Kentucky, United States;Porter;Pipkin Brewing Co.;This is an excellent porter. After I finished it I found out Pipkin was sold and the bottle I drank was made in early 2000, which is disappointing.
Pipkin Porter;La Grange, Kentucky, United States;Porter;Pipkin Brewing Co.;Kick ass porter. Deep brownish red color, great roasted aroma. Tastes include roasted malts, mocha and coffee, and a bit of something like tobacco (?!) One of the better porters I''ve had in a while.
Pipkin Porter;La Grange, Kentucky, United States;Porter;Pipkin Brewing Co.;toffee nose, roasted flavors, a very nice porter. Too bad the brewery bit the dust
Paesanos Birra;Holland, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;New Holland Brewing Company;12oz bottle. This one worries me as I just bought it, see that it is retired and the last rating is from ’04. New Holland cap, so this is the right one. Hazy golden color with a small sized head. Aromas of rotten citrus rinds with some toasted grains. Tastes of really nothing. Watery with some grains.
Paesanos Birra;Holland, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;New Holland Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy light-golden orange with a fluffy white long-lasting head. Nose comes off as a real light mix of apricot, orange hops and spice. Short bubbly mouthfeel with a slight touch of bitter, ending with a slightly metallic aftertaste.
Paesanos Birra;Holland, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;New Holland Brewing Company;This was a pretty decent beer that I picked up just because I had never seen it on the shelf before. Color was very light hazy golden. Aroma was mostly hoppy with a wisp of spice. Taste was again slightly hoppy and refreshing. Relatively light bodied beer and left very little aftertaste. It would go very well with the cuisine for which it was intended - Italian. A little better than average beer overall.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Chocolate Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;"Draught at RB Colorado Springs. Pours dark brown with a fizzy and bubbly light brown head, mostly diminishing, fair lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (chocolate, bread, cookie), light hops (grass), average yeast (dough, leather) with notes of cola and caramel. Average duration, moderate sweetness, light acidity and bitterness; well balanced chocolate and dark malt flavor that does not overpower. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, thin texture and a chalky finish."
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Chocolate Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;Denver - Great roasty aroma, with some nice chocolate flavors and well balancedcoffee acidity. This is a nicely balanced porter that never goes above and beyond, but does the trick in my book, creamy and esy to drink.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Chocolate Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;Tap @ Rock Bottom, Homestead, PA Poured dark. Opaque. Nice velvety looking very light brown head. Almost light caramel color to it. Nice lacing on the glass. Didn’t pick up any aroma while it was cold, but as it warmed I detected a slight chocolate and malt aroma. Flavor was malty with sutle chocolate flavor with a sweet aftertaste. As it warmed more of the chocolate notes were apparent as well as a very slight roasty malt bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied. Smooth mouthfeel.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Chocolate Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;[Tap at Rock Bottom, Denver] A pitch black beer with a small collapsing light brown head. The aroma is very light, what is there is roasted. The flavor is sweet, but very thin for a Porter - it contains slight hints of chocolate - much less than expected from a chocolate beer.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Chocolate Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;[draft - Rock Bottom Pittsburgh - Homestead, PA] Poured a rich black color with a very thick and lasting tan head. Full and toasty roasted chocolate aroma. Good flavor of burnt malts and chocolate and a nice smooth malt finish. Good bitter coffee finish at the end as well.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Chocolate Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;Lovely dark beer with a fine full white head. Aroma was chicory and chocolate and reminded me of a stout. The taste was raisins and chocolate with a lot of malt. Made for a very interesting and very good taste. Worth a try. More like a stout than a porter.
Primátor Dark Lager;Náchod, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovar Náchod (LIF);Pours dark mahogany with a full, light tan head. Aroma is dried fruit and light roast. Taste is thin plum, moving to roast. Finish is roast. Disappointing Tmavy.
Primátor Dark Lager;Náchod, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovar Náchod (LIF);Copenhagen 12/9 2019. 50 cl bottle from Meny, Vermlandsgade, Amager. Primator usual design from their Traditional Line of beers. This time in dark brown ad with a Hop Flower as motif. Pours clear, dark brown with a red hue. Medium-sized yellowish head. Bubbly. Settles as thin flimsy layer of foam unable to cover the surface of the beer. No Lacing. Aroma is medium-intense, very sweet and a little metallic. Dark malts. Very light roasted. Brown sugar, caramel, hints of toffee. Tin foil. Medium carbonation. Slightly thick, smooth, soft, lightly tingling texture. Flavor has a fairly strong sweetness followed by a very moderate bitterness. Aftertaste is sweetish with a light bitter undercurrent. Lingers shortly. Quite strange to have a Hop Flower as a motif when you make a rather sweet Dunkel.

Primátor Dark Lager;Náchod, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovar Náchod (LIF);In the aroma we have a mix of raisins, rum and some chocolate. Nice, light brown beer, but the head is lacking. Not too much going on in the taste - a bit of dark malts, some acidity and sulfur. I'd say it's your average store-bought Czech dark lager.

Schübel Bräu Dunkel;Stadtsteinach, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Brauerei Leonhard Schübel;"Bottle by 6.11.(12). Nose is a little farmy and stale, but sweet; hissingly pours a deep mahogany with a light brown head. Taste has caramel, chocolate, and a lot of roast and especially ash, there’s some run-down campfire ash from the end of the night and a little cigarette reminiscence. Watery body is sweeter than many. Like the character."
Lang-Bräu Schönbrunner Urbock Dunkel;Wunsiedel-Schönbrunn, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Lang Bräu Schönbrunn;Bottle. Pours clear reddish chestnut, small tan head, good lacing. Aroma of toast, roasty, nutty, hint of smoke. Flavor is medium sweet, light bitter. Medium body. A bit of acidity.

Aroma reminds of dark, toasted bread and caramel. Taste leans towards the sweet side with the same bready, caramely notes. Aftertaste is balanced by some bitterness. Overall this is a decent, well brewed bock.

The aroma offers up caramel sugar soaked hay, sugar malts, is that a touch of rauch maybe and light prunes and figs. The taste starts with a mix of caramel and sweet dark fruity esters like prunes, brown sugar coated ripe cherries and figs and moving into a mild rauch malt note that is blending into sweet malts and a hay like sensation and a bit of breadiness. These are some interesting flavor combinations and I’m enjoying how it is coming together.

Dark reddish brown colour with small tan head. Mild bready malty aroma with raisin and sugary sweetness and some almond and alcohol notes. Seems oily.

Lang-Bräu Schönbrunner Urbock Dunkel;Wunsiedel-Schönbrunn, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Lang Bräu Schönbrunn;Der malzige Antrunk ist ausgewogen und leicht röstig, die Süße spielt hier wie auch im weiteren Verlauf kaum eine Rolle. Dagegen ist eine mittelstarke Herbe von Bedeutung, die sich besonders im Antrunk sowie im Abgang zeigt. Die Malzigkeit ist im Mittelteil stärker würzig, im Vergleich zu anderen Bockbieren ist das Aroma aber als mild einzustufen. Die Röstigkeit sticht hier leicht heraus, wenig später im Abgang kommt die milde Süße hinzu, das das Malz eher zurückrudert wirkt das Ganze zu harmlos. Zuletzt eher herb als malzig. 8/7/8/8/9/8
De Keyzer Double Saison;Maastricht, Netherlands;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brouwerij De Keyzer;It’s called a double saison, but I don’t know what’s so double about it. It tastes like a normal saison, even a bit flat.
De Keyzer Double Saison;Maastricht, Netherlands;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brouwerij De Keyzer;33CL bottle at home, Dark amber beer with a white head, quit long after taste, not a bad beer.
De Keyzer Double Saison;Maastricht, Netherlands;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brouwerij De Keyzer;0,33 l bottle, Pothuiske, Maastricht. Cloudy deep amber brown one with a fine creamy head. Fruity and tart aroma, interesting. Wild berries, green leaves, rosehip-nice chaos. Medium bodied beer, nice rosehip and green leaves, light fruits like fig and some wild berries and a good tartness.

De Keyzer Double Saison;Maastricht, Netherlands;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brouwerij De Keyzer;A shock of taste and nothing. The sweet beginning mellow out quickly into more familiar citrusy saison flavors. Brown and hazy with a floral head.
De Keyzer Double Saison;Maastricht, Netherlands;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brouwerij De Keyzer;Bottle. Gusher. Unclear brown pour, amber glow with a thick creamy slightly tanned head. Aroma of caramel, fruits and hops. Flavour is fruity, mildly bitter, mildly sweet. More bitterness of hops in the after taste. Nice beer.

De Keyzer Double Saison;Maastricht, Netherlands;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brouwerij De Keyzer;bottle @ ’t Arendsnest in amsterdam. Pour is really dark amber with a smallish eggshell head. Nose is faint malt and yeast, but very subdued. Flavor is initially a big, sweet bready malt with brown sugar and some stone fruit, which is pretty out-of-place when your brain is thinking ’saison’. Very dubbel-ish. Finish is more of the classic saison flavors of spicy/fruity yeast esters and a pleasant dry hop bitterness to close. Nose and initial taste were pretty bland/meh, finish was excellent. A strange take on the style for sure.
De Keyzer Double Saison;Maastricht, Netherlands;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brouwerij De Keyzer;Bottle, bought @ ’t Arendsnest, Amsterdam. Pours hazy amber with a small, staying, off-white head. Aroma is sweet, fruity, oranges and light pepper. Medium, lively carbonation, fine dry mouthfeel. Flavour is pretty sweet, malty, fine light pepper, caramel and a bit of sugar. Good, but maybe a tad too sweet. Light dry hoppy finish.
New Glarus Native Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;Pours reddish brwon with a thin tan head. Smells of fruit, caramel, some sugary hints. Tastwes sweet and malty with some rosey hints on the finish.
New Glarus Native Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;The beer pours dark and cloudy. decent sized head. has an aroma of fruit, apples, cranberries and Wisc. cheese. It finishes off dry with a little bit of nuttiness.
New Glarus Native Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;Beer pours a deep dark brown, about a half of an inch head, with solid lacing. Smell, hints of chocolate and coffee. Taste has a decent coffee presence with a little chocolate as well as water. Decent carbonation wise, but a little too watery. Good drinkability, probably wouldn’t have more than a couple however.
New Glarus Native Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle. Lighter brown ale with small head, nutty aroma with slight malts. Taste is malty and finishes fairly sweet and dry. Thin on the palate.
New Glarus Native Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;"Traditional style bier. Very dark in color, with a smoky aroma but surprisingly light taste, with a citrus note. I only wish the big breweries would make a dunkel/amber that tasted like this so people wouldn’t think ""it’s a dark beer, it must be heavy."" From a bottle, and from the tap."
New Glarus Native Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Poured a deep mahogany color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of toasted malts, caramel, and maybe some very light citrus. Tastes of caramel and kinda nutty. Thin body. Nothing really stood out either good or bad.
New Glarus Native Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;Pours a murky brown color, inititally (but briefly) topped by half an inch of loosely packed white foam. No head retention, no lacing. Mildly sweet aroma, nothing special. It has flavor, but subdued. Almost watered down. You ever had Koolaid that was made with too much water? All the elements of the flavor were there, but in bad proportion. That’s what this beer was like. The maltiness was watered down chocolate and grain. There was a fruity tang that was watered down and a bit musty. There was generic hop presence that was a walk on the mild side. Light body, llight carbonation.
New Glarus Native Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;Aroma of grain over light noble hops, with some caramel or toffee notes. Appears a dark ruddy mahogany color with no effervescence or head to speak of. Flavor is bland, but with some vienna-style qualities. palate is crisp and light, though watery. Overall, a very poor offering from an otherwise stellar producer.
New Glarus Native Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;Don’t know if I’d call this an Amber. Dark malts employed and a nutty slightly smokey character to it. Palate a bit thin for what I like, but considering the style appropriate. A decent session beer, but nothing extrodinary.
New Glarus Native Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Glarus Brewing Company;bottle - Pours a pale brown with only a ring of foam around the edge of the glass. Very little aroma, but what there was was sweet and nutty. Palate is thin and goes down without giving letting you get a real taste. The sweet yeasty flavor is there more as an aftertaste. All in all not a bad beer, but I’m not sure I’d buy it again. New Glarus makes better than this.
Greenwich Roaring Red Ale;New York, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Draught in New York. Copper colour. Earthy, malty notes in flavour with a caramel profile.
Greenwich Roaring Red Ale;New York, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;decent enough red. some peanut skin in the aroma. quite sweet, hint of butterscotch, but meanders along to not much of a finish
Greenwich Roaring Red Ale;New York, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Fruit aroma (grape, cherry). Drinkable--one of the better beers (relative to style) brewed at Chelsea Brewing Co. Deeper and slightly darker than I would expect of the style. What a red should be--a bit of something for the inexperienced beer drinker looking for a session beer.
Greenwich Roaring Red Ale;New York, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;This is contracted by Chelsea Brewing Company. Looked and tasted as it should be. Didn't stand out.

Greenwich Buzzing Blonde Ale;New York, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;very pale and low in flavour except for some stale weet bix. really genuinely boring
Greenwich Buzzing Blonde Ale;New York, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;"Lager color, gets a good head. Light aroma. ""Blonde"" is a deceptive label--it covers everything from insipid swill like this to Westvelteren's Blond."
Greenwich Buzzing Blonde Ale;New York, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;This is contracted by Chelsea Brewing Company. Looks and tastes like a blond nothing special.
Greenwich Buzzing Blonde Ale;New York, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;This is a typical Blond Ale. It is nothing exceptional. Although the first time I sampled it, the beer was incredibly wheaty/yeasty, the subsequent two times have yielded an ordinary Blond Ale that's not worthy of further comment. Contract brewed by Chelsea Brewing. It is likely very much like Chelsea's Checker Cab Blonde Ale.
Greenwich Stout;New York, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Greenwich Brewing Co.;it´s generally a pretty safe bet that at a below-average brewpub they can at least make a decent stout. this was decent but no better. espresso and nutrasweet aroma, quite thin, reasonably dry but easy drinking
Greenwich Stout;New York, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Rather more watery than oily in appearance, 85% opaque (low for style), unusual aroma. Smoke notes in flavor with obvious malt base--good texture but not especially chewy.
Greenwich Stout;New York, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Greenwich Brewing Co.;This is contracted by Chelsea Brewing Co. Not a bad stout. A little on the thin side for my tastes
Greenwich Stout;New York, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Sweet and slightly bitter. This reminds me of Mackeson''s. Thin head. Lightly roasted.
Greenwich Hefe;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Draught in New York. Golden colour, slight hazy. No head. Served way too cold. Citrusy lager feel to it. Mouthfeel is thin, too much of Co2. No banana, slight estery fruitiness.
Greenwich Hefe;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;i really would like to taste a good american wheat some day. i dunno how they can call this a hefe. flat, lemon aroma, some wheat syrup taste and detergent finish
Greenwich Hefe;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Lemon aroma, even after the lemon was taken off my glass. Hazy, juice-like colors--quality. Fruit juice with a head. Flavor less entrancing. Not offensive, but dull, with a bit of bitterness. Too bad the flavor was so disappointing.
Greenwich Hefe;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;This is contracted by the Chelsea Brewing Company. Austinpowers hit it right on the head. I wasn't too thrilled with it.
Greenwich Hefe;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;A wheat in the American style that''s halfway to a German hefe. Its darkness and bitterness makes it clearly of the American variety.
Greenwich Pilsner;New York, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Draught in New York. Very pale yellow. Snappy, papery bitterness dominates. Also bit floral. This is a German Style Pils with maize notes. Crisp but boring.
Greenwich Pilsner;New York, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenwich Brewing Co.;the only style american brewers seem to have less idea with than hefeweizens is pilsners. this was so sweet, slightly citric, and tasted like melted lemonade iceblocks. why do american brewers make so many bitter beers but forget about bitterness when they´re making pilsners? the mind boggles
Greenwich Pilsner;New York, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenwich Brewing Co.;It has an aroma, even if it is of wet cardboard, raw chicken, and sausage casings. Flavor not much different. At least it wasn't overcarbonated.
Greenwich Pilsner;New York, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Sharp and fairly crisp. This is a muted Euro-style pilsner that lacks in bitterness. Nice.
Greenwich Pumpkin Ale;New York, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Greenwich Brewing Co.;This is contracted ny the Chelsea Brewing Company. This wasn't bad. Had a good pumpkin flavor too it. Wasn't overpowering.
Greenwich Pumpkin Ale;New York, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Greenwich Brewing Co.;This Greenwich Brewing Co. has been hit-or-miss, but this beer's a hit! This Pumpkin Ale has little aroma and the taste is of a spicy pumpkin pie. A real flavor 'punch in the face' if you like the gourd pies and such. In October pumpkin ales seem to rule the roost, and I'm a 'When in Rome' kinda guy, so I drink 'em cuz they're just plain fun. This one's got twice the punch of Buffalo Bill's pumpkin ale.
Greenwich Pale/ESB;New York, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Draught in New York. Charneol colour. Cascade profile in aroma. Papery dryness. Citrus and mandarin. Flavourful compared to Greenwich’s other(Chelsea Piers) other beers.
Greenwich Pale/ESB;New York, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greenwich Brewing Co.;i dunno how something can be a pale/esb. amber, mild peach nectar aroma, reasonable bitterness at least and a pleasant firmness
Greenwich Pale/ESB;New York, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Strange beer. Cork taste, it could be a 125 years old lambic with too much hop. A bit rotten and cloying. However it looks nice.
Greenwich Pale/ESB;New York, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greenwich Brewing Co.;"A very gentle pale ale, not so much of an ESB. Slight bitterness lingering. Heck, really this is just a plain ol' beer with a little food coloring. Almost the definition of ""average American beer""."
Greenwich Pale/ESB;New York, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greenwich Brewing Co.;This is contracted by Chelsea Brewing Company. Another not to special beer. Tasted and lookd as it should be.
Greenwich Pale/ESB;New York, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Shockingly bitter and out-of-balance. Like Dogfish Head 90-minute IPA. The aftertaste punishment lingers for quite awhile.
River City Vanilla Stout;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Stout - Dry;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);Bleh! Strong note of vanilla extract in the aroma and flavor, paired with a pretty watery and bland dry stout. Its basically like they took their middling dry stout and just added a bunch of vanilla extract. Sweet and gross. I took 2 sips - and sent it back, the only beer I''ve ever sent back in disgust. Also imagine taking a dry stout and tossing in a shot of Irish creme liqueur.

Pfungstädter St. Nikolaus;Pfungstadt, Hesse, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Pfungstädter Brauerei Hildebrand;Pours dark ruby-brown with a beige head that dilapidates quickly. Taste is mainly around malty flavours, some very instant roast and a gentle bitterness that becomes more dominant in the palate. Not as sweet as many other of its peers. Good.
Pfungstädter St. Nikolaus;Pfungstadt, Hesse, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Pfungstädter Brauerei Hildebrand;Plutôt bonne surprise avec cette Urbock Winter, pas qu'elle soit exceptionnelle, loin de là, mais je m'attendais réellement à moins bien. Ce qui lui manque le plus : de la variation avec des arômes trop linéaires autour du caramel, des céréales, des épices (notamment coriandre), de fruits (agrumes, raisin) et avec une belle amertume. Robe brune, parfaitement limpide (EBC 44) sans mousse cependant. Le nez, d'un caractère certain, est appréciable sur le caramel, le moût de raisin, les céréales et les épices (coriandre). L'attaque est décevante par contre. On commence bas côté intensité. Celle ci est fraîche sur l'amertume, le caramel et les épices. Heureusement la bière va se révéler le long de la dégustation avec une intensité allant crescendo pour au final, avoir une bonne présence en bouche. La seconde bouche, plus présente que l'attaque est à la fois plus épicée et plus fruitée (agrumes et raisin). L'arrière bouche, sur une ampleur limite, est quant à elle moins intéressante, sur la fraîcheur et les épices. La troisième bouche qui monte alors sur l'amertume arrivant à son maximum est un excellent interlude avant le final où les arômes deviennent plus expressif, plus ample et sur une bonne longueur? L'arôme se révèle alors, faisant davantage que ses 7% Abv. Côté arôme, rien à signaler de neuf cependant. On a eu peur...heureusement que le final est bon, et permet de passer une agréable dégustation.

Pfungstädter St. Nikolaus;Pfungstadt, Hesse, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Pfungstädter Brauerei Hildebrand;From Cervezasespeciales. In Bavaria glass. Reading JHTP11 Ch23. Very nice moreish caramel taste that makes it very moreish and refreshing, with enough bitterness to not be cloying. Not much wintery though
Pfungstädter St. Nikolaus;Pfungstadt, Hesse, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Pfungstädter Brauerei Hildebrand;Pours brown from the bottle and leaves a creamy head that soon dissipates. Lots of evident carbonation. Aroma is very weak overall, with roasted and alcohol notes. Taste is a nice mix of bitter and sweet, with the sweet dominating up front and the bitterness coming through near the finish. Otherwise, lacking in depth. A bit of alcohol near the end. Decent, but not worth getting again.
Elysian Pandoras Bock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);15-Feb-14 (22-oz bottle: Purchased at Bottleworks in Seattle, WA) This beer has a hazy, amber-brown body with a small, off-white head that dissipates within a few minutes. The nose is decidedly malt, with caramel, toast, toffee, and cocoa. On the palate, the toffee, caramel, lightly sweet cocoa, and raisin are immediate, but the flavors of dry, toasted bread, cut grass, mild earthiness, and gentle bitterness provides a good counterpoint to the sweeter flavors, although, to be clear, this isn’t all that sweet to begin with. It’s medium-plus in weight, medium in carbonation, finishes relatively dry for a Bock, and is very smooth. Overall, this is a pretty solid and very enjoyable beer. Bocks can be too sweet at times, but this beer offers a really nice, balanced profile that makes the beer quite easy to drink.
Elysian Pandoras Bock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Tap@Tangletown. Clear dark caramel color with lasting ivory sheen.

Elysian Pandoras Bock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Draft at the brewpub in Seattle. Pours a dark amber color with golden orange edges and a one finger off white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring.  Sporadic streaks and spots of lacing left behind. Sweet malt aroma with subtle grassy hops.  Hints of caramel, light chocolate, toffee, rye and hazelnut balanced by spicy, grassy hop notes. Medium bodied with a stronger earthy, herbal hop presence than expected.  Very herbal/medicinal with dry, earthy pine that overpowers the sweet malt notes a bit too much for my liking.  Hints of rye, caramel and toffee provide balance but I wish that it was tilted in the other direction.

Pours dark brownish with a thin head. Sweet flavors of chocolate, caramel, toast, a little dark fruity notes, and a light bitterness in the finish that cleans it all up. A little earthy.

Kül Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);12 ounce can from Woodman's Appleton, 7/26/19. Mmkay for 30-ish cents.

Kül Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);It’s good and cheap. I rather live listening to the beer snobs blather in about what they think. Hilarious. Shut your pie hole and just drink it, ya jag offs. I know it doesn’t have a craft label on, so you can’t like it, you hipster wanna bes. Go back to PBR, you already ruined that for us normal guys.
Kül Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Simple beer, taste like a mix of Miller light and coors light. Good friendly drinking beer. Won’t win any crazy awards but
Kül Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);This is just a watered down version of their regular piss water lager. But unlike other light beers this isn't just flavorless, it has flavor. And that flavor is horrible. I paid a ridiculous $1.16 for a four pack of this @ Woodmans. That's $1.14 more than it's worth. Can.
Kül Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);355ml can. Inoffensive grain water. This costs 18 bucks for 3, 3! cases. it was 1.19 for a 4pk. Yeah drink this over bud light, you don’t need brand equity in the light beer category if you want a drinkable product. So better than bud light is all i can really say.
Kül Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);This is what a light beer would drink, just to keep its figure. Brewed with the essence of grain you may ask yourself, has it entered my mouth yet? Oh yes you'll know when it has, crisp, balanced, quenching the end of a hard day, the nag is that it goes down like water...
Kül Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"""I’d definitely büy it again, I would not shy away from it"" a friend said. I qüestion who I have as ""friends"". So there is that. Ör not. It’s certainly not JUNK the likes that we know as Coors Light but it does not fly in the rarefied atmosphere like Blatz straddling the skies like a wasted X-15....if Kül & the Gang were still Kül enough to drink a Kül Beer they would pick Blatz....those fückers were geniüses! Or not."
Kül Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Kul beer is the nectar of the gods.

Kül Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Poured a light-gold color with minimal head and virtually no lacing.

Carlton D-Ale;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Pale Golden Colouring with a large thick white head which lasted for a long period of time. Aroma was a mix of a dead and decaying rat and a sewerage. I did not pick up any fruity aromas, but the yeasty aroma could have quite easily been the one I was picking up. The flavour matches the aroma with a watery, flat and stale finish.
Carlton D-Ale;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Quite possibly the worst beer ever invented. A dirty, rotten, rancid taste. This is not beer and I feel like a tool for giving it a mark of 1/20 but this site doesn't allow me to go lower
Carlton D-Ale;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Oh dear. I think D-ale is what they did to this for sure, coz it ain't an ale.

Stones Bitter;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tadcaster (Molson Coors);I remembered this beer fondly as one of the very first I went into a kiosk in the UK and bought when I was old enough. Well, that is where the fondness stops. Drinking it now I think it is simply dreadful. Pours a dark golden colour with a one finger head. Bready and yeasty smells, bit of sulfur. Taste bread, sweet bread, watery, some bitterness, but it is bland and weak. Just, terrible.
Stones Bitter;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tadcaster (Molson Coors);Not a memorable beer but a pleasant refreshing bitter ale. It's outlasted many similar type ales so I guess it's fairly popular in its Yorkshire heartland.
Stones Bitter;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tadcaster (Molson Coors);Poured from can. Big frothy head, light amber colour. Taste has more in common with a golden ale than a bitter. Thin, bit watery but not as bad as expected. Feels very retro, especially the orange can.

Rosies 100 Mile Wheat;Leadville, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Rosies Brewpub;After seeing my note taking, my hosts insisted I try this and the RAM stout ... they serve this with an orange slice.

Rosies Mineral Belt Pale Ale;Leadville, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rosies Brewpub;Slightly hazy and light orange. Lightish and watery texture, but with a syrupy base. Malts were sweet and sugary, with hints of cocoa and chocolate-covered caramel. But you had to look behind the strong aromas to find them. Hops were sharp, perfumey and somewhat stark (sour rose petals, cleaner). Some acidity and a healthy amount of bitterness to wash away any residual sweetness. Not horrible, but kind of all over the place in the mouth. Earlier Rating: 10/12/2003 Total Score: 1.3 Golden. Hops were flowery, earthy, very perfumey and somewhat bitter. Malts didn't seem to keep up. Spicy-perfuminess became a little harsh, which carried into a less than pleasant finish, leaving a stark, flower-petal-like bitterness on the tongue –- with nothing to counterbalance it.

Rosies RAM Stout;Leadville, Colorado, United States;Stout;Rosies Brewpub;[Colorado Road Trip – 2006] This was a dark black stout with a great head. Loved the aromas and the flavor was not bad but it seemed as though it was watered down. It was weak and did not have a huge thick feeling. I was a tad disappointed with the lack of deep malt flavor and missed the chocolate and coffee flavors which should be in the beer. I wish I could give a high score but I am true to my beer. It needs more work on recipe.
Rosies RAM Stout;Leadville, Colorado, United States;Stout;Rosies Brewpub;"After seeing my notetaking, my hosts insisted I try this and the 100 Mile Wheat; The stout had a nice visual appeal ... pitch black with a nice brown head. Big thick consistency and roasty character, this is a good stout."

Palmer Lake The Natural Blonde;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;On tap at the place itself....poured a yellow-gold, nearly translucent...moderate whitish head.

Palmer Lake The Natural Blonde;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;Clear, light orange with a residual haze of a head. Hearty malt-cereal as a base, but almost too much. There’s not bittering agent here at all, which makes it suffer.

Palmer Lake Special Belgian Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;Batch One - bottle cellared for at least 2 years. After popping the cork, the aroma had a slightly metallic but still yeasty edge. Amazing distinction between the aroma and flavor - almost like dinking two different beers. Deep honey flavor with a touch of hop balance and a long bread-dough finish. Nice hints of Jumex tropical nectars. Remarkably drinkable - wish I’d had more of these. A great beer for a stormy Colorado weekend.
Palmer Lake Special Belgian Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;on tap-pours a light tan head. Color is slightly hazy yellow. Aroma is malt, sweet. Taste follows. Little carbonation. Not to my taste.

Pours a murky brownish gold...big white head. Lotsa yeastiness in the nose with notes of sweet fruity malts. Taste is nice and clove spicy with some sharp hop bitterness. A little sweeter than I prefer, but still tastes good. Full mouthfeel, and finishes with a nice dry hop bitterness. We liked it, although it’s not the best example of the style we ever had.
Palmer Lake Special Belgian Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;Draught @ Palmer Lake Brewing Company. Brownish Gold. Dark in color for the style, but i’m not stylistic when it comes to beer, so I don’t care. Lovely, yeasty, fruity aroma with hints of bubble gum, banana, pear and clove. Spicy, citrusy, phenolic and very fruity with notes of bubble gum and clove. An enjoyable brew.
Palmer Lake Special Belgian Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;Golden body with abundant carbonation and a creamy, snow white head. Aroma reminded me of old lime peels and warm butter plus some yeasty funk and hints of esters and sulfur. Some decent malt character improves the flavor but this beer is too sweet, too bitter, and just not right. I could not get passed this strange burnt butter quality. Strange beer.

Honey wheat and malt aroma with a fruity grape yeast nose. Honey wheat flavor with a sweet yeast body. Warm and creamy fizzy palate, a tad spicy.
Palmer Lake Special Belgian Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;"I really enjoyed this beer, talked to the brewer at the Strong Ale festival in Boulder - he used all belgian malt and 5 (not 2) strains of yeast. Fairly complex but a perhaps little too sweet. He told me each batch of Belgian is a different style so it's hard to get any one ""dialed in""."
Palmer Lake Special Belgian Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;They should put this in with packs of baseball crds because it sure tastes like bubble gum. It does not taste like it might have come from Belgium at all. More like a strong golden ale. I would not bother with this one again.

Big banana nose with some yeasty notes. Smooth, healthy carbonation. Malty & fruity; some sharpish alcohol nips. Hints of sourness and a bit of tartness, though a little distracting acidity. Rerate from the Boulder Strong Ale Fest: Spicy, roasted, toasted, and chocolaty. I could've sworn I sensed a little cinnamon, too. Had a little 1554 quality to it. Good beer. Much better than my last sample. Bottle, Batch 1: Hazy and orange with a thin layer of creamy white head. Very citrusy nose. Sharp mouthfeel; lively carbonation. Yeasty and malty flavors. Sharp and somewhat bitter hops. Some slight oxidation and cardboard, but not enough to offend too much. Dryish aftertaste, lingering with notes of bread dough."

Palmer Lake Peak Pale Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;IPA;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;Had this beer on 4/23/2003. Aroma is almost not there with a faint hint of malt (very faint). Color is a solid gold with a touch of amber. Good carbonation and a very nice tight head. Taste is plain and lightly bitter. Starting with a light body it goes down easy with a creamy feel to start with, but then turns a bit sharp.

Palmer Lake Peak Pale Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;IPA;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;A light bodied brew with a nice hops finish. The color was great and this had a very nice head. Could use some better malts and this would be a winning beer.
Palmer Lake Peak Pale Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;IPA;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;"Basic gold-amber pour....medium-sized fluffy white head. Nice hop aroma...herbal. Even more bitter hops in the flavor, some decent maltiness in an attempt to balance this act. Nice lingering bitter finish.

Palmer Lake Locomotive Stout;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;Draft 9/1 (Brewery-Warehouse)-Pours black with a small tan head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, and malt. Taste of the same. This barely medium bodied brew is a bit watery.
Palmer Lake Locomotive Stout;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;A nice stout with a deep dark color. liked the flavor and the finish. This was a very nice stout did seem to be a tad watery. Whished this had more umph in the chocolate and coffee flavors. Good brew needs some work.
Palmer Lake Locomotive Stout;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout;Palmer Lake Brewing Company;I enjoyed this slightly out of the way joint. The tap pour was pretty dark, almost black. By the time I got the glass the head was a minimal dark tan. Big roasty choco-malt nose. More dark roasty malt in the flavor, maybe just a tinge of espresso.

Siletz Winter Warmer;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Siletz Brewing and Public House;In the bomber bottle from John’s Market in Portland. Pours a cloudy rusty brown with a medium beige head. Lemon-like aroma. The flavor is quite tart with an incredibly harsh bitter bite at the end. At first, I wondered if something was wrong with this because the bitterness was not hop-like at all, but rather the bitterness one might expect from drinking a poison. One of those Mother-Nature-is-warning-me bitter flavors. However, as it warmed and I kept at it, I realized that the bitterness really was from hops, just not very good flavoring hops and way too many of them. Plus, I was not poisoned.
Siletz Winter Warmer;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Amber ale? Hah. Murky dark orangish amber, moderate to small head, some lacing and retention. Aroma is caramel, light hops, some darker fruit, light spicing. Medium bodied, somewhat sweet, mostly not enjoyable.
Siletz Winter Warmer;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Siletz Brewing and Public House;This amber ale poured with a thin beige head, eliciting a musty aroma. The bottle cap was slightly loose and the flavor is very skunky, lieading me to believe that the beer is infected. Either that, or it is not a very good brew. Very citrusy and sour.

Siletz Winter Warmer;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Siletz Brewing and Public House;"Enjoyed this while spending some time with my special friend Allison. The nose is dried fruit, wheat, and berries. The brew pours a murky chestnut with amber blonde highlights. The mostly lasting uber stiff & creamy bone colored head leaves fair lace.

Siletz Wooly Bully;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Siletz Brewing and Public House;22 courtesy of DA. About 12 months ago I had an infected bottle of this beer, and had wanted to retry it. Derek was kind enough to see it on my want list and to send me a bottle to give it another go. Pour is hazy golden orange, smallish off white head. Aroma of sweet maltiness, some chemical bitterness. Taste is sharply sweet with bright acid bitterness. Palate is medium to thin. Overall a little harsh, not totally for me. Thanks for sending Derek, I had really wanted to like this better.
Siletz Wooly Bully;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Siletz Brewing and Public House;finally get to try a Kellerbier... pours a dark medium murky brown colour ... wow, this is an interesting style, has a nice mouthfeel but the aftertaste is what is strange(new to me), some sourness and tweakness , but refreshing and not drying out like sour ales ... i can see liking this style alot more with more practice (and different samples) but this beer is still kinda nice. lacing is ’a new rug’ .... the aftertaste is so wicked and different, i can see most people hating this beer, but to the few who love shocking refresh beers and sour ales, should love this!! ..first bottle from BT...
Siletz Wooly Bully;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Siletz Brewing and Public House;22oz Bomber - Siletz Brewing Company - Siletz, OR Aroma – Huge infected bottle. Very sweet to off sour aroma. Appearance – Amber in Color, Thick head and clear. Flavor – Nasty drain pour beer. The beer was super sour and this was not a Lambic. It was a nasty infected beer. Palate – Terrible Mouthfeel, horrible texture with a sour finish. Overall – One of the worst beers I have had in a long time I poured it down the drain I hope the others I got from Siletz are ok.
Siletz Wooly Bully;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Bottle from PC Market of Choice in Ashland, OR. Now I know why they had this crap on sale for $1.99 for a 22oz. Holy Lord, this was Siletz’s version of the nasty Jelly Bellys they made for Harry Potter movies. I guess Wooly Bully was right on because this one was dead on beef (or buffalo) jerky. Yuck. I’d rather have Coors Light (you know, the dark-side!).
Siletz Wooly Bully;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Bottle from PC Market of Choice in Ashland, OR. Not much to say about this one. I swear it almost tasted like beef jerky. Which is not all that bad of a taste, but not in a beer. It was sweet and malty. I would have poured it down the drain, but we were camping. This was a tree pour.
Siletz Wooly Bully;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Darker golden color, almost no head, virtually no lacing or retention. Aroma is gas, sour malts, sweet malts, uh... not good. Medium bodied, sweet with a somewhat hot finish. I don’t see the point.
Siletz Wooly Bully;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Appearance: Pours a clear, orangey body with a small, off-white head. Smell: Here we go again! Some maltiness squelched in a sea of vinegar and unclean feet. Taste: Just a filthy taste altogether. Malts abandoned to vinegary spoilage, what a shame. Midway into this fiasco you pick up an eerily tart, infectious fruitiness that never lets up. Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: Siletz is synonymous with drain pours. Different bottles from various sources and various times and they’re always infected. Siletz needs to tackle this issue once and for all or just give it up.
Siletz Wooly Bully;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Pours a crappy light rust color with a small thin tan head, and average lacing. Average carbonation with a smell of sweet hops. Tastes of malt and corn with a woody bitter taste. Light on the pallet, this should be avoided.

Sweet flavor with some corny malt here and there, with an alcoholic tang. Very thin mouthfeel with hefty carbonation. This is like Lapin Kulta Ice on steroids (higher ABV) - ouch! Timo: this was the 7th beer Juha has ever rated, and the rating has not been updated since then. I wouldn’t be surprised if the points would drop by 1-2 at a re-rate :)

Evans Pump Station Pale Ale;Albany, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;The beer looks outstanding with a mildly hazy straw color, a nice white head and great lacing on the glass throughout. The beer smells decent with a nice blend of citrus, resin, and a bready smell. The beer tastes great with a decent resin taste with a hint of white pepper and a bready finish...almost acts like a IPA. The mouthfeel is outstanding as the beer is carbonated perfectly and you are left dry and mildly bitter. Overall, a solid APA from an under rated brewer (except the Kick Ass Brown, it has earned its stripes).?
Evans Pump Station Pale Ale;Albany, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;Aroma is light floral and a touch of grain.

Evans Dawns Dry Stout;Albany, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;C.H.

Light sweet roast on the nose. Thin, soft roast, chocolate, but very light flavors. Rather empty, soft roast on the finish. Not bad or flawed in any way, just lacking depth in a lot of places.

Evans Dawns Dry Stout;Albany, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;In short: A lame creamy dark ale How: Tap at brewpub The look: Clear dark mahogany body topped by a beige ring of foam In long: Discreet nose of pecan pie. Taste is very soft with hazelnuts, some dark caramel, commercial chocolate chip cookies, soy sauce, refried beans, cooking oil. Body is slim and oily and the carbonation is soft. A very lame beer that is not even to style. It is however drinkable but only because it doesn’t taste much. I’ve been to this brewpub when it first opened and every other year after that, and all I can say about them is that they really started at the bottom and it’s been downhill ever since.
Evans Dawns Dry Stout;Albany, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;Pours black with about a finger of tan head. Nice dark chocolate and coffee aroma. Very dry with just a touch of chocolate milk sweetness. Little bit of smokiness in there with the roast. Solid, if a bit boring.

D - Very drinkable. Could use a touch more flavor, but the flavors that are there are well balanced. The mothfeel and finish are really nice and pleasant.

Evans Quackenbush Blonde;Albany, New York, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;Draft. This brewery tends to be pretty hit or miss, and this was a huge miss. Old and sweet and dirty, with rag-water and popcorn. Just not good at all.

Evans Hefeweizen;Albany, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;Draft at the brewpub. A hazy golden beer, this is pretty standard American brewpub fare for the style. It did have the requisite portion of fruity swirl, and just a hint of yeasty funk.

Evans Hefeweizen;Albany, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;A rather mediocre hefeweizen at the brewpub. Started with a clear appearance, never a good start, too dark, not enough of a nose, was a bit buttery, a bit of yeastiness, but not much in the way of bananas or cloves. Don’t order this if you like a true to style hefeweizen. Do order if you like it more Americanized and bland.
Evans Hefeweizen;Albany, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;The beer has a decent appearance with a nice hazy orange color to it that passes very little light through the glass, has a nice white half finger head and little lacing left on the glass. The smell is decent with an obvious banana and clove up front with a lemony zest and mild wheat finish. The taste is decent with a nice blend of orange/banana/lemon/clove and a hint of corriander on the back end. The mouthfeel is great as the beer is well carbonated and leaves a lingering mld bitterness around. Overall, I can see why this beer has won some medals and is enjoyable for everyone.

Evans Kick-Ass Brown Ale;Albany, New York, United States;Brown Ale;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;APPEARANCE - Very dark brown, i can only see that it is brown around the edges and when backed by light. NOSE - light hop scent, not overpowering, just right bitterness. Not sure of hop variety, but it’s not floral or fruity, or overly resinous. FLAVOR - the brewery’s description is on point. Malt forward with a modest amount of hop bitterness. NOTES - solid brown ale.
Evans Kick-Ass Brown Ale;Albany, New York, United States;Brown Ale;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;Drank this brew years ago at the Pump Station, surprised I never rated it! Drank recently from a two litre growler pour from a tap at the Pump House! Pours a beautiful hazy, brown color with decent beige head. Has an aroma of roasted malts, slight nutty notes. Tastes roasty and complex, with the perfect smoothness. A good brew!
Evans Kick-Ass Brown Ale;Albany, New York, United States;Brown Ale;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;At the brewpub, this was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a dark brown color with a light transparency about it. Carbonation could be seen rising to fill a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds leaving some foamy lacing in a messy way. The smell had a semi-sweet dry roasty nuts, caramel, toffee and a light cocoa combining into a light sharp resin. The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors to combine initially and then as it warms more resin starts to kick into a decent little hop bite. Lingering resin and nuts lead into the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body so it becomes pretty sessionable. Carbonation comes across fairly smooth and allows the resin to be the bitterness over my tongue. Overall, I say this was a pretty good American Brown Ale, hopheads might even like it.

The aroma is very sweet with notes of coffee, smoke, spices, and licorice root on a sour background. The flavor much more simple than the aroma; sweet with notes of caramel and a mystical end where I can't recognice the spices but it reminds me over overripe fruits but maybe it is the emmer? The body is thin. Thanks Alex (fiulijn) for bringing this to Denmark."
Falken Bio Emmerbier Dunkel;Schaffhausen, Switzerland;Specialty Grain - Other;Falken;Dark brown coloured. Sweet and fruity aroma with notes of coffee. Malty and slightly smoked flavour. Quite thin and sourish finish.
Falken Bio Emmerbier Dunkel;Schaffhausen, Switzerland;Specialty Grain - Other;Falken;"a beer brewed with ""emmer"" (how the hell do you translate this in english ??), a grain which was used by the egyptians 4000 years ago - clear brown colour, no head, malt and hay aroma, sweet, grainy, slightly sour, dry finish"
Bubes Heffweizen;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bubes Brewery;one of my favorite breweries. wonderful taste and truly nice finish. well balanced and thought out
Bubes Heffweizen;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bubes Brewery;Cloudy banana blonde with decent carbonation. The beer body glows from ambient lighting. Soapy phenolic aroma. Simple banana and wheat flavors make for an uncomplex, lackluster try. Sour banana and yeasty finish. Under-developed, but palatable.
Bubes Heffweizen;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bubes Brewery;Sampled on tap at the brewery. Really nice banana clove aroma as a traditional German Hefeweizen ought to. Sweet and spicy with light Perle hops in the nose on top of wheaty sweetness. Cloudy butterscotch amber with lacing white creamy head. Medium watery body with medium carbonation. Starts wheaty with mild sweet banana character. Spicy finish with some clove and dull yeast bitter. Decent Hefeweizen, though a touch too bitter on the after and overall a bit watery.
Bubes Heffweizen;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bubes Brewery;Tap at the brewery. Slightly hazy yellow colored body, sticky sea-foam head looks really, really inviting. The nose is inviting as well, full of estery lemongrass and wheat scents, very fresh smelling. Sticky, low carbonation, light and a bit syrupy. Lacking depth, it’s very plain tasting with just some light yeasty lemon flavors, just lightly sour, but overall it’s kind of hard to taste anything in this beer.
Bubes Heffweizen;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bubes Brewery;On Tap. Pours a hazy straw color with a fluffy white head. The flavor has a very strong wheat component with a little cloves and banana mixed in but not a lot. This is not a great hefe and tastes closer to an american wheat, but it is not bad.
Bubes Heffweizen;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bubes Brewery;Pour was a cloudy, medium yellow/brown color with a fluffy white head. Aroma is mostly bananas with some strawberries, and bread. Flavors were banana nut bread with a kind of grainy mouthfeel. Not bad.
Bubes Heffweizen;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bubes Brewery;2007 nice hefe, good body nice cloudly yellow appearance, pretty standard hefe qualities, bit wheaty, sweet, not bad.
Bubes Heffweizen;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bubes Brewery;Medium golden color and very cloudy. Yhere is some fruity banana and citurs flavors which dominates - the souring effect of the wheat is almost non-existant. Not bad though.
Bubes Heffweizen;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bubes Brewery;Cloudy & hazy appearance, slighty dark golden in color, very nice soft lacy head, the flavors were way too fruity though, seemed like banana flavors but they were way too overpowering, other than that a very nice wheat beer
Bubes IPA;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Bubes Brewery;Pretty solid for an IPA. Not as hoppy as I would expect, it is a good east coast version of an IPA, just slightly subdued, but a good beer none the less. I ordered the sampler then I also got a pint of this after I finished the 4 beers in the sampler.
Bubes IPA;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Bubes Brewery;Poured a clean copper/gold color with a foamy off-white head. Sweet hop aroma with lots of grapefruit and pineapple present. Flavor was very nice also. Loads of sweet grapefruit blended nicely with a shot of carmel and a pineapple finish.
Bubes IPA;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Bubes Brewery;wow. I was surprised at how good this was. excellent hops aroma and taste and had a nice bitterness to it. This is one of the best IPA’s i’ve had. I should note that you have to get if fresh to get the whole experience, because I ’ve had various qualities of this, the rating above being for the fresh stuff.l
Bubes IPA;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Bubes Brewery;Excellent IPA, floral aroma, nice soft lacy head, lots of hop bitterness, spicy aftertaste, great balance, well-balanced hop/malty flavors, not too overpowering, very good IPA
Bubes Brown Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Bubes Brewery;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a semi-dark brown color with an off white foamy head that fell off at a decent pace. Light stringy sliding lace. The aroma had some sweet and roasted nuts up front and then a light dose of caramel/toffee malts flowing underneath. Light earthy hop. The flavor was moderately sweet with the roast of the nuts and malts coming through fairly nice. Slight milk chocolate smoothness rolling through the aftertaste and on into the finish. The palate was almost medium bodied with a pretty good sessionability about it. ABV felt good and it came across super smooth rolling all around my tongue. Overall, really super nice brown ale well worthy of having again.
Bubes Brown Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Bubes Brewery;Pours dark brown from tap with a thin white head. There’s a slight hint of malt on the nose. Bigger caramel flavor on the tongue but not much else. Finish is clean.
Bubes Brown Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Bubes Brewery;Deep dark amber/brown in color. Little head or carbonation. Flavor/Aroma is grainy with a dollop of sweet chocolate. A bit thicker/more flavorful than their amber that I just had. Slight to moderate hops to balance, grassy I think.
Bubes Brown Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Bubes Brewery;This was served on tap at the pub and was apparantly on nitro. It had a thick tight foamy head that lasted. A nice chocolately charachter with a nice mild smoothness and almost no hop presence. An excellent dessert beer to finish off a meal.
Bubes Brown Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Bubes Brewery;draught. tapped a deep but translucent brown with very little head. smells faintly of malts and nuts. flavor of sweet malts and almonds and walnuts. finishes a bit on the sweet side.
Bubes Brown Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Bubes Brewery;They called this a nut brown, so I will rate it as such. The color was very deep brown with minimal off-white head. The aroma was nutty, providing almond, hazelnuts, walnuts, some roasty malt, toffee, and slight molasses notes. The palate was on the dense side and very complex, with more intermingling nuts than a party at Turbo’s house. I got the almond, walnut, and hazelnut flavors, plus a solid roasty malt, some chocolate, and slight molasses hints. I growlered this, and found it to be excellent.
Bubes Brown Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Bubes Brewery;Pours a clean, brown body with a small white head. The aroma is carmel, nuts, and dust. Flavors were walnuts, salt, pepper, mild carmel, and some mild earthy hops. One of the better browns I’ve had.
Bubes Brown Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Bubes Brewery;Bube’s Nut Brown Ale pours to a beautiful, bright, chest nut color with a thick and creamy white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is very inviting with good aromas of sweet malt and nuts. The palate is soft on the tongue with lots of good sweet malty and nutty flavors. Bube’s Nut Brown finishes with more sweet malt and nuts, then ends with just enough hop bitterness to take the cloying edge off this beer. This is a very well done, soft, sweet and nutty brown ale. It is a very food friendly beer, and would match well with a number of dishes on the Bube’s menu. I enjoy a nice pint of this one at the bar relaxing with friends, and soaking in the wonderful atmosphere at Bube’s. If you ever find yourself in Lancaster County PA, a trip to Bube’s Brewery in Mount Joy, is well, well worth the time and effort.
Bubes Brown Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Bubes Brewery;Earthy and nutty, this is a good example of the style. Slight toffee overtones, this beer is well balanced with the earthiness balancing the bittering hops throughout. Even keeled with a musty earthy aroma and finish.
Bubes Stout;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout;Bubes Brewery;"Offered as an Irish Stout I beleive. The aroma is of light coffee & malt, the apperance is solid - dark & black. The palate is very thin for a stout & the flavor belies the look; way too watery, lacks any heartiness in taste or anything of note or substance in the mouth. It is drinkable."
Bubes Red Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bubes Brewery;Red appearance and smooth after taste. This is easy and light. Nice brew. Found it to be very enjoyable.
Bubes Red Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bubes Brewery;Pours ruby red from tap without much head. This one feels flat to me. The liquid just lays on the tongue without much life-force. Can’t say I’m getting much aroma or flavor out of this one. Finish is pure water. Still it’s a hell of a lot better than Coors Light.
Bubes Red Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bubes Brewery;Beautiful dark reddish brown pour under not much of a head (from a growler), nice roast & caramel sweet aroma, a pleasant surprise!
Bubes Red Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bubes Brewery;Draught at Bubes, deep red hue with nice foam head. Some cherry aroma. Kind of tart on the pallet with cherry undertones. A little chemical taste and some bitterness. Might have to give this another try but a bit sour for my pallet.
Bubes Red Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bubes Brewery;draught. tapped a deep garnet with a thin white head. not really much to smell. taste is mostly sweetened malts, some brown sugar. finishes much like an English bitter, lightly sweet with a fair amount of hop bitterness. not really true to the style but quite drinkable none the less.
Bubes Red Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bubes Brewery;(USA) Had a Ruby Red color with a Sm-White Head. I thought this brew had Dry Berry taste. Not much else to say, But drinkable.
Bubes Red Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bubes Brewery;Draft at the brewpub, July 2006. A hazy red beer with a lazing beige head. The aroma is sweet malty with primary notes of caramel, but also light notes of citrus. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of yeast, berries, caramel, and a bit of barn yard, leading to a dry bitter end.
Bubes Red Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bubes Brewery;Pours coppery amber with tinges of ruby. The aroma is caramel malt and some vinous fruit, and slight berry notes. Taste is caramel malty, with a mix of berry and vinous fruit. Medium palate, with a solid complexity. Well crafted.
Bubes Red Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bubes Brewery;Poured a medium amber/brown color with a foamy off-white head. Bitter hop aroma. Flavors were bitter grapefruit and mild carmel. Pretty average red.
Bubes Red Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bubes Brewery;Stopped in for lunch, tour & a brew. On tap. Head is thin, dissapates quickly. Color is an amber red orange hue. A grainy, woodsy taste, medium body and a crisp, clean finish. A bit different for a red ale & pretty refreshing.
Bubes Kolsch;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Bubes Brewery;Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a honey color with a large creamy white head that left minimal lacing. The aroma was phenolic with a bit of mildew. The flavor was tangy, sweet, phenolic and a bit off with a mildew note. Medium length finish. Medium body.
Bubes Kolsch;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Bubes Brewery;Smooth, fresh, crisp and easy on the palate. This is very tasty and you can have more than a couple.
Bubes Kolsch;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Bubes Brewery;This one isn’t bad. Pours light and crisp like a Kolsch should. Not a lot of aroma off of this one but a sweet grassy vibe on the tongue. Crisp and clean finish.
Bubes Kolsch;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Bubes Brewery;Light, mild flavor, citrus and light spice, light amber color, light white head. Nothing too challenging, just a nice, refreshing kolsch.
Bubes Kolsch;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Bubes Brewery;Had this last nice on tap. Pretty standard Kolsch, lightly hopped with doughy malt smell and taste. Nice body. A bit on the sweet side. Pretty good.
Bubes Kolsch;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Bubes Brewery;Pour was a clear yet somewhat opaque golden color with a fizzy white head. Somewhat subdued, but nice hop aroma. Flavor was grassy and earthy hops with a toasted malt backbone. Not a bad Kolsch.
Bubes Kolsch;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Bubes Brewery;On tap at brewpub. Clear pale golden in color with a nice white head. Malty and hoppy. Light, crisp and refreshing flavor. Well balanced. Very nice beer. Enjoyable.

Bubes Kolsch;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Bubes Brewery;i didnt’ think this was anything special. rather normal flavor, went down smooth. slight ting of hops.
Bubes Kolsch;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Bubes Brewery;Pretty decent kolsch, pure gold color, generous fluffly white head, flavors were a little on the bland side, but very crisp & clean, refreshing & smooth, a nice mix of the subtle hoppiness with slight malt character

Bullfrog Friar Frog Dubbel;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Bullfrog Brewery;Sampled at GT’s birthday tasting. Mahogany pour with a small head. Nose of candied sugar, plum, raisin, and fig. The flavor holds big candied fig, overripe apple, plum, and vinous red wine. Quite nice but not earth-shattering.
Bullfrog Friar Frog Dubbel;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Bullfrog Brewery;dark nut brown, thick beige head that lasts. Nose is dates, candi sugar, lightly tart lacto, balanced though. Flavor more so, would border on infected but soft carbonation and presence of raisin, candi, prunes, plums. Very balanced and refreshing, good as a dubbel with a refreshing lacto touch. Terry’s touch is noticeable.
Bullfrog Friar Frog Dubbel;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Bullfrog Brewery;Bottle shared by MrChopin. End of the bottle so the pour was a bit of a murky brown. Tart earthy aroma, berries, stone fruits, toasted malts, must and grapes. Also smelled a pour from earlier in the bottle which was more caramel and raisin forward. The taste is cranberries, earthy notes, caramel and a bitter finish. Medium bodied. Decent.
Bullfrog Friar Frog Dubbel;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Bullfrog Brewery;Dark brown pour with a medium beige head.

Nose is fresh citrus, oddities, small olive, salt, lime. Taste is tart, moderately sour, with red wine character. Very nice actually with lactic acid and lemon lime. Refreshing, quite tart. Interesting.
Bullfrog Friar Frog Dubbel;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Bullfrog Brewery;A: The pour is a dark amber, perhaps copper, with a short lived tan head. S: Nice caramel and malt notes, some bread in there as well. Definitely a lot of apples, sort of like cider. It smells quite oxidized as there is a bit of cardboard to it as well. T: Mild dark fruits such as raisins and plums. Toffee, bread, and caramel. There is a hint of spice notes from the yeast as well as some of the cider notes that were present on the nose. More of the oxidization and cardboard here as well, too. M: Medium in body with a moderate carbonation. O: Seemed incredibly oxidized and not all that good. Interesting to try, though.

Okocim Jasne Pełne / Beer;Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;Light golden colour,sweet malty taste. When it was cold it, straight out of the tap,it tasted very ok, but when the beer got warmer, then it was more like a cheap euro lager.
Okocim Jasne Pełne / Beer;Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;Koncerniak, jedyny w lodówce cieszący się nieco lepszą opinią. Zapach o dziwo bardzo przyjemny, zero kartonu, zero rzygowin. Treściwy i mocno słodowy, zboża, dużo zboża, biszkopty, słodki i całkiem przyjemny i bez wad. Czyste i przejrzyste, niewielka piana, nieco blade ale ok w sumie. W smaku ku mojemu zaskoczeniu, bardzo poprawne, treściwe, słodkie, zbożowe, biszkoptowe a nawet nuta miodu ale nie z utlenienia. Goryczy i chmielu brak a szkoda, bardzo niska ziołowa goryczka pojawia się w posmakach tylko na końcu języka. Ciało zadziwiająco solidne, wysycenie spore ale pasuje tu. Piwo ku mojemu zaskoczeniu pełne, konkretne, fajnie zbożowe i słodowe i bez wad. Brak tylko chmielu i goryczki. Piło się naprawdę przyjemnie. Pozytywne zaskoczenie, ciekawe czy trafiłem na jakąś dobrą partię?
Okocim Jasne Pełne / Beer;Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Carlsberg Polska;Piwo jasne klarowne z biała średnio obfitą pianą. W aromacie diacetyl oraz lekkie estry. W smaku delikatna słodowość. Piwo bardzo wytrawne lekko alkoholowe i mocno nagazowane.

W smaku maślany przeciętniak, wodnista konsystencja, goryczka żadna. 5 lat temu lubiłem to piwo. Piwo się raczej nie zmieniło zbytnio, ja szczęście ja tak.
Malt River Olde Albany Pale Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Malt River Brewing;4 ounce sample. Aroma is extremely faint and slightly sweet. I cant get much more out of this aroma. Copper/amber transparent color with an off-white/tan heas and nice lacing. Mildly caramel maltiness in the middle with small hop bitterness to finish. Boring.
Malt River Olde Albany Pale Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Malt River Brewing;had this beer at TAP NY brew fest. great time good deal and almost every beer at the place was good .... so this beer i think that i remmember that it might be pretty good ... i think?
Malt River Olde Albany Pale Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Malt River Brewing;Ruby red murky appearance with a strong hops aroma. The taste is pretty much all hops. Watery body. One-dimensional but it works. It’s lack of sourness and all other things outlandishly disgusting is probably why it’s one of their best sellers.
Malt River Olde Albany Pale Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Malt River Brewing;Cloudy amber colour. Slightly toasty, slightly fruity aroma. mellow, but balanced flavour. There’s a hint of crystal malts (OK, so the description says caramel malts). Hint of apricoty hops, toast. Well-made, if a little shy.
Malt River Olde Albany Pale Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Malt River Brewing;Deep amber gold color, slightly cloudy with littel to medium thick head. sweet fruity malt aroma with hoppy undertones. very sweet and fruity malt flavor with very slight hop finish.
Malt River Red Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Malt River Brewing;This is pretty tasty stuff, a little too malty though. I enjoyed it’s thickness and creamy finish alot.
Malt River Red Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Malt River Brewing;"Dark ruby appearance. Good irish malty aroma. There was malt presence in the taste but this gave way to a disgusting sourness. I’m wondering if this was a bad batch, or maybe they’re usiing water from the ""sparkling Hudson"" in brewing these beers. Thin body."
Malt River Red Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Malt River Brewing;Cask. Very dissapointed. Barkeep pulled off a pitcher worth before serving me and it still tasted off. Deep red in color, very malty beer. Some off notes in aroma other than malt, flavor had sme cooked vegetable notes to it. This being the third beeer that I tried, it was actually the best...
Malt River Red Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Malt River Brewing;Deep golden amber color with a medium thick head. sweet malty aroma. slightly sweet malty flavor with strong hoppy undertones.
Malt River Oatmeal Stout;Latham, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Malt River Brewing;Nice and thick, dark stout. Didn’t have alot of flavor though, seemed strange to have such a thick beer with little flavor.

Hyde Park Maibock;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a milky yellow to copper color with a slim cap of a white foamy head that fell off into oblivion. No lace. The aroma had some soft sweet bready malts, somewhat like dough, gentle grassy hoppiness, not necessarily bitter, just there. The flavor was lightly sweet with a fair wet doughy aftertaste and finish. The feel was almost medium bodied but sat just a tad under. Felt fairly smooth along my tongue. Overall, I didn’t mind this for me, but then again I just expected it to be a normal hellerbock and nothing more than that.
Hyde Park Maibock;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Hyde Park Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Pours a clear yellow with a thin white head. First sign that this probably won’t be good, as any of the maibocks I’ve enjoyed featured a bit darker coloration, and didn’t have fat ugly soda bubbles in them. Skunky grain hits from afar, smells infected, with some sour caramel notes, and buttery aromas. Sweet, and tastes of plastic and vegetables. Some very weird off flavors in here. Tastes like a plastic soda. Very strange bitterness. I tried to think of this as a badly infected sour, but that honestly didn’t help much. I knew after the first whiff that I wouldn’t be able to finish my pint, but so as to not appear rude (and to watch the baseball game) I sat at the bar for about an hour and slowly worked my through about half of this abomination before I just couldn’t take it anymore.
Hyde Park Maibock;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Hyde Park Brewing Company;"04.23.05 Tap at TAP NY. Terribly pale golden. Foamy. Sweet, lightly tart. Not at all exciting. A bit overdone with some wheat, grass, and mineral flavors; gets tiresome."
Hyde Park Maibock;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Hyde Park Brewing Company;TAP NY. Clear pale, white head. Sulfur hop aroma. Pale malty hoppy flavor. Nice body. Hops like a big pils. I like it.

Hyde Park Maibock;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Hyde Park Brewing Company;(Draught) Pours a white head and a clear, light golden body. Thin and milky - as in lactic. Bland.
Hyde Park Maibock;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Grainy sweetness, almost wheaty, meets a nascent skunk...Feeble acidity tops this odd cat off...Not unpleasant, but there are much better examples...
Hyde Park Maibock;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Mild grainy sweetness - not unappealing. Clear golden, some lacing. Some meaty flavour - slight sweetness. Grainy. Light body. On tap at TapNY festival.
Hyde Park Maibock;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Hyde Park Brewing Company;TAP NY sample. Very light lager-like appearance, light lemony aroma, not a lot of malt. Fairly full bodied, but more grainy and citrusy than anything...tastes more like a pils than a bock to me, perhaps a bit off and sour at the end. Not terrible, but definitely not a success.
Hyde Park Maibock;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Pale Golden color with a medium thick head. Malty aroma with hoppy undertones. Sweet malty flavor woth slightly sweet hoppy finish.

Rohrbach American Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Draft at Buffalo Rd. brewpub. Pours clear yellow with a white head. Clean malt flavor and aroma with a light caramel note and a medium body. Simple but drinkable.
Rohrbach American Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Yea, this is your standard lager to lure some people from Bud I guess. This would be nice to have after I cut my lawn this summer.
Rohrbach American Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rohrbach Brewing Company;This beer was about what I’d expected it to be, which is why I’ve never ordered it in the past. Very inoffensive. Light, hazy looking, thick head. Wheaty taste. Decent palate, not real strong, malty and citrusy. Low aroma.
Rohrbach American Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rohrbach Brewing Company;5 oz draught sample at the brewpub, mid-October 2006. Very pale, watery gold color with a thin touch of head but quite nice lacing....light honey-malty aroma, faint hints of fresh-mown grass....body bready-doughy, honey and cornbread, and low but quite evident dry hops, quite fresh and clean, light but absolutely refreshing mouthfeel and crisp, natural carbonation. Pretty solid effort actually.
Rohrbach American Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rohrbach Brewing Company;draft at Rohrbach’s. Very pale yellow pour. This definitely looks like they are trying to make a beer that is palatable to the BMC crown. Flavor is a touch sweet with a non-offensive finish.

Highgate Fiddlers Pluck;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);pulled with a tap handle in the shape of a violin scroll, which gets it an extra point. a pretty unremarkable bitter. golden syrup colour. very nutty at first, then you get spicy, slightly soapy hops and a slight thin bitterness. smells like challenger hops but i'm probably trying to fart the theme of jaws, as user-ex would say. unfortunately this pub is in danger of shutting down owing to rapacious rich bastards living in the new flat developments alongside - buy the tshirt, sign the petition etc. but don't go to birmingham unless absolutely necessary of course.
Castelain St Léonard Bière de Garde;Benifontaine, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Castelain;On draft pour. Yellow golden color with a light head. Not much going on here for a bier de garde. Tastes more like a clean lager. Crisp.

Castelain St Léonard Bière de Garde;Benifontaine, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Castelain;if I trust eczematic, I should have aged this one ..........................
Castelain St Léonard Bière de Garde;Benifontaine, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Castelain;this was a VERY old bottle from the dusty depths of Bert''s Bierhuis, Utrecht. The label was all faded and ripped - I''m guessing at least 5 years, probably 10 or something. So the alcohol content was probably a fair bit higher than 5.9. after a bit of a struggle with the decomposing cork, we poured it out and it was a beautiful clear red-gold, with a creamy, lumpy eggshell-coloured head. the taste was incredible: impossibly smooth, rich and woody. i tasted caramel fudge, vanilla, rum-n-raisin icecream, and just plain tasty full malt. still managed to finish really dry and lemony. this was one of those beer experiences when you get down on your knees and give thanks to the gods of beer.

Napoleon;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);"(Bottle 25 cl) For some reason I had expected a pilsener in here (must have overlooked the acohol...), but nothing could be further from the truth. Guess this is what the Belgians would call a ""double dark"", a rich, dark, malty beer with a strong alcohol. Very complex beer with notes of dessert-wine and dried fruits + notes of both chocolate and anise. Lightly bitter finish. Yet another hidden Belgian gem. 020897"

Lionshead;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Ok so we got a 24 pack of cans from a weird liquor store for a tournament we were a part of. The man at the liquor store said it was good, but then that he never tried it. Ok, we get this beer anyway. The box was a bit wrecked but thats part of the charm I guess. Its not the worst cheap beer, but its far from good. Here is the issue. This website needs a fart scale. Different beers will cause more or less farts. Lionshead is a big time farting beer. Stay away.

Draught House Marleys Gnarly Barley Wine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Draught House Pub & Brewery;(draught) dark caramel color with ring of lasting off white bubbles. Nose of spicy citrus hops, slight dank, toasty caramel. Taste of well integrated hops, toasty caramel, chocolate and cocoa. Very nice creamy finish and easy to drink.
Draught House Marleys Gnarly Barley Wine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Draught House Pub & Brewery;On tap at the brew pub. Pour is dark red with a beige head. After scanning the other ratings, I’m stunned we are drinking the same beer. Mine was intensely bitter and hoppy. Much more bitter than a number of pale ales I’ve had. I couldn’t taste the alcohol, which I found odd in a barley wine. There was an overpowering citrus flavor the drowned out everything besides the bitterness. It had the look and feel of a good beer, but the aroma and taste didn’t match the style I was expecting. If it were an IPA, I would have thought it was over-hopped. Maybe I got the bottom of the barrel or something. Weird.
Draught House Marleys Gnarly Barley Wine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Draught House Pub & Brewery;(Draught) Pours a burgundy body with a moderate creamy beige head. Aroma of raisins, cherry, bread, pear, grass, and caramel. Flavor of cherry, raisins, molasses, grass, earth, and caramel malt with a bitter finish.
Draught House Marleys Gnarly Barley Wine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Sampled on tap at the brewpub. The beer pours dark brown with a cream-colored head. The aroma is caramel with sweet malt and some piney hops. This is what a barleywine is supposed to smell like. The flavor is pine and citrus hops along with caramel and some alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation.
Draught House Marleys Gnarly Barley Wine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Draught at the Draught House- solid dark purple with brown and black shades in color, some lacing from the wafer white head, aroma of funk and earth- interesting. Hits the mouth with a strong medium body, malt is there and a little bit hard, brief hop wave comes in the middle, finish is hard and warming. A little rough around the edges, but still nice.
Draught House Marleys Gnarly Barley Wine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Black-tinted plum color. Great lace. They always kill the head. Stone nose, which conjours up a mineral, earthen character. This, in in-of-itself is satisfying. Armoma also has a little black cherry. Hoppy flavor, malty, strong, and a little sugary flavor. Storng, malt finish lasts and satisfies. taste like it was aged in concrete barrels ( err, tanks ). It’s just picking up a lot of mineral flavour. Pinion-plank ending.
Draught House Marleys Gnarly Barley Wine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Draught House Pub & Brewery;"Nice dark brownish maroon pour to it. Smell is nicely balanced as is the taste. Hoppy, but amply malty to balance. Not too sweet, but not too hoppy and leaves you feeling like this is incredibly mild. Good flavors and a good ""sessionable"" barleywine."
Draught House Marleys Gnarly Barley Wine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Excellent Barleywine. Shining, thick copper goo. Frothy dense head that could hold a quarter or two. Laces all the way down the glass to the last drop. Fabulous aroma. Blue cheese and lots of it. This was a first for me from a barleywine, but the funkiness of it was really quite appealing. It isn’t all abrasive fruitiness though, the malts are soft enough in their own right to provide a pear and apricot background that is both subtle and calming. The aromas on this guy are really quite satisfying. Well balanced and interesting all at once. On the first sip the blue cheese jumps out of the glass and then falls slightly under the weight of the hop whallop as the malts die off slowly. Apricots and bitterness linger. If I brewed a barleywine I would want it to taste like this.

Draught House Marleys Gnarly Barley Wine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Draught House Pub & Brewery;WOW! This was a treat! Solid delicous taste! Had a dark rust color, sweet smell, and you can’t really taste the alcohol, very tasty and crisp for a barleywine

Draught House Sleep Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Pours about black. Holds a 1 inch frothy tan head. No much aroma. The flavor is quite bitter, like a hoppy stout? Strong bite. Foamy palate.
Draught House Sleep Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Nicely done stout. Dark and malty..........................................
Draught House Sleep Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Opaque black, light tan and average sized head. Sweet, lightly roasted coffee beans in the node. Complex flavor: nice balance of chocolate, maltiness, coffee, earthiness. Reminiscient of their Century Stout but without the strange mouthfeel. Tad bit of mint in the finish. A very rich, respectable stout!
Draught House Sleep Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Draught House Pub & Brewery;This beer is so much better than their century stout. I would best desrcibe this as an imperial stout with a little more roastedness and a little less alcohol flavor. The sweetness, coffee and alcohol taste was put together very well and went down very smooth....nice. The head was very chunky looking though....I have seen prettier stouts.
Founders Hill Oktoberfest;Downers Grove, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Founders Hill Brewing Company;Sweet malt aroma. Pale amber in color, average carbonation (draft). Flavor is also malty, but is on the mellow side for the style. Not too sweet or spicy, just a laid back brew. Interestingly, the finish was almost on the dry side, compared to the substantially sweet finish one gets from most Fest offerings.
Founders Hill Brown Ale;Downers Grove, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Founders Hill Brewing Company;Light to medium brown in color, very clear. Pretty nice head, especially for a beer on tap. Aroma is very grainy and bready. Flavor is of course almost all malt, toasty and bready with some hints of caramel and spice. Very nicely balanced, not too sweet. I would try this again.
Founders Hill Light Lager;Downers Grove, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Founders Hill Brewing Company;Bland in every way. Just enough carbonation and sweet ricey malt to be called a beer. I bet I could drink this all night and never blow a .03%. Stick to their Heritage Wheat which is far superior. Save this for your Bud drinking buddies, they will never know the difference.
Founders Hill Light Lager;Downers Grove, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Founders Hill Brewing Company;Very pale slightly cloudy yellow in color, average carbonation and head for a draft lager. Very light aroma, but it gives away something interesting about this beer -- there's wheat in there! Flavor is almost exclusively wheat malt. Very clean and uncomplicated, no discernible hop flavors and extremely low bitterness, almost non-existent. Clean tasting, and while not complex in any way or form, was better than I was expecting, being as I am a wheat beer fan.
Founders Hill Heritage Wheat;Downers Grove, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Hill Brewing Company;A hazy yellow color with a sudsy white head that hung around for a while, this has a grassy aroma with a subtle hint of hopping. Medium bodied but no strong flavoring, mild malts & hops. Clean finish. Founders Hill, Downers Grove, IL
Founders Hill Heritage Wheat;Downers Grove, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Hill Brewing Company;"This was served a bit warm from a tapper at small festival, and my notes are a bit sloppy! ""Some cloudiness and weisse nose, but light on taste. great with the German Potato Salad"" I must have been good and buzzed by that point!"
Founders Hill Heritage Wheat;Downers Grove, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Hill Brewing Company;Wheat and light hop aroma. Menu reports that Hallertau and Willamette hops were used for this one. Cloudy medium yellow color, typical head and effervescence. This beer reminded me almost exactly of the Redhook Hefe-Weizen. Medium body, fairly balanced. Wheat malt and hop interplay is nice, but surely not spectacular. Finishes clean and with a light bitterness.
Founders Hill Scarletts Raspberry Wheat;Downers Grove, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Founders Hill Brewing Company;As far as I can tell, this is just the Heritage Wheat with a little raspberry flavoring added. It's not too sweet or syrupy, but I liked the Wheat better without the raspberry. It even looks just like the Heritage.
Founders Hill Hidden River Red Ale;Downers Grove, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Founders Hill Brewing Company;Caramel, malty and spicy aroma, really quite pleasant. Medium red-amber in color with a goodly amount of carbonation. The caramel/spice aspect carries over into the flavor, where it mingles with Willamette and Hallertau hops, producing a pretty nicely balanced beer. Not too sweet, and with some appreciable bitterness for the finish. Good balance, too. This was probably my favorite beer at Founders Hill. Give it a shot if you're in the neighborhood.

Tom Wood's Lincolnshire Longwool;Barnetby, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lincolnshire Craft (prev Tom Wood's);Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. Amber with a small white head. Malty aroma with a rather lovely note of faint woodsmoke. Taste continues the slightly ashy theme, but it doesn’t dominate by any means, and there are other shifting, evanescent, possibly fruity flavours to enjoy. A subtle and understated beer.
Tom Wood's Lincolnshire Longwool;Barnetby, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lincolnshire Craft (prev Tom Wood's);[Cask at The Three Judges] Amber with a moderate, dense head. Toasted malt, dusty yeast character, perfumed, some grassy notes. Light and dry.

Tom Wood's Lincolnshire Longwool;Barnetby, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lincolnshire Craft (prev Tom Wood's);Deep amber/copper colour. The first impression on the nose was of earthy, smoky malt, with some flowery hop aromas from the First Gold coming through, and continuing strongly into the flavour. Good balance of juicy fruit, dry malt and hop bitterness in the mouth. Medium body. Dry, bitter, finish. A nice autumnal ale, with a slightly rustic feel to it.

Founders Hill Blacksmith Stout;Downers Grove, Illinois, United States;Stout;Founders Hill Brewing Company;dark and pretty, with a good strong nose. tasty, with a deep roasted flavor, but it lacks the thickness i crave in a stout.
Founders Hill Blacksmith Stout;Downers Grove, Illinois, United States;Stout;Founders Hill Brewing Company;First off, this is not served on nitrogen! Hooray for that. This beer is apparently brewed with 6 different malt varieties, plus oats. Dark chestnut brown color, not too dark as stouts go. Aroma is nice roasted coffee and some light toffee. Flavor is very coffee-ish as well, roasty and dry. This may be a dry stout, although I didn't get the chance to talk to anyone there about specifics of any beers. Moderate hopping level, and finishes with some acidity. Medium-bodied, and while not exactly watery, it doesn't possess that creaminess that I've come to associate with great stouts.

Rebellion Pickled Ghoulies;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;quite a nice change of pace from hoppier beers which i tend to like better.

This is an ESB though , so more booze even if its still subdued . Citrus hop nose , grass, spice , lemon like dishwashing vibe , caramel , dried raisin , brown bread : Brown and boring to look at as it should be as an ESB . Its malty , its citrusy , its ok .

Clear pale amber in colour with a thin white head. Short pleasant floral citrus notes in the nose. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives a digestive tea biscuit base with redcurrant fruit and a slight hint of toffee malt. Strong hop content in this with resiny bitter notes in the long aftertaste.

Cotleigh Blue Jay;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cotleigh Brewery;"Cask - Wetherspoons, Norwich. A fairly dense layer of white foam forms the head on this slightly hazy pale brown coloured beer. Aromas are malty with citrusy hop overtones. The flavours aren’t as well balanced with the hops not seeming to know whether they’re coming or going; there’s a lot of indecision as the bready, caramel flavours of the malt competes with a delicate bitterness. Pleasant and easy-going on the palate. Overall not bad for a session bitter."
Cotleigh Blue Jay;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cotleigh Brewery;Cask in the New Crown.

Pours a clear golden colour with a good white head of foam. Fresh hop aroma and taste, a lot better than I expected.

Lovely hedgerow hop profile in flavour, toasted malts have a polished furniture taste to them. Drinks as if quality ingredients have been too gently dosed and locked away under a layer of varnish - who’s reinbeer is going to get merry of that?

Dark brown, orange hue, opaque, dense creamy head with thick lacing. Aroma is bready, airy. Body is medium, smooth, soft carbonation. Taste is thin, tangy, apple core, browned apple flesh. Resin, pepper and bread crusts in the finish. Soft bitterness endures. Just OK. It grew on me."

Cotleigh Kiwi;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cotleigh Brewery;"Cask at the Bell, Waltham St Lawrence. Apparently making a reappearance after 10 years.

J.W. Lees Ruddy Glow;Middleton, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;J.W. Lees;First tasted this Ruby Ale in the Crystal Palace, Glasgow (JDW) in October 2007. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear ruby red in colour with a thick tan coloured head. Strong toffee aroma like Cairngorm Wildcat long in intensity. Thick creamy mouthfeel, amazing texture for a 4.5% and good lacing. Pale malt base gives a robust but smooth creamy butterscotch flavour. Dusty hop resins give a prickly earthy note to the short aftertaste. Finish is slightly drier with a hint of liquorice evident amongst the sweet caramel taste. A decent session Ruby Ale and tastes far stronger than ABV suggests. Well recommended.
J.W. Lees Ruddy Glow;Middleton, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;J.W. Lees;(Cask at Eagle, Hoxton, London, 28 Nov 2007) Dark ruby colour with frothy, off-white head.

Aroma is sourish and vinous with plenty of buttery vanilla. Flavour is more of the same with smooth berryish fruit, caramel, and red wine creaminess.

Poor. 2.3 Oct 06Cask conditioned @ Standing ORder (JDW), Soton. Nicely malty without being sweet or over the top.

Lees;A dark, chestnut, red brown beer with a weak, beige-white head. the nose is a mellow blend of sweet malt and liquorice. The taste is of the sweet malt again, along with the liquorice, there is a tiny hint of dry bitterness in the finish to perfectly balance the sweetness. The aftertaste is smooth and bitter sweet.

Three Needs Bamberg Rauchbier;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"On tap at the pub. Why this smoke-filled pub hasn't had a smoked beer before now, I'll never know. Decent, very sweet and full-bodied version of the style, with hops only distinguishable at the front when its cold. As it warms, becomes a bit sticky and sweet; when slightly cold, a decent oaky smokiness emerges on the nose, a fairly rich amount in the taste, with heavy caramel malt and a bit fo dried fruit. Not bad."

Brick Lager Yellow Label;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;"Bottle sample, 341 ml, from the LCBO. Pale blond with immediate fizz akin to the head on any number of sodas. Depleted in 3 seconds flat. Sweet corn is the precursor to hay and grains. Slight boozey/Iodine aromas as well. Metallic flavours offset any decency brought about by the very little hops that are present. Corn/Maize flavours dominate the finish. Fizzy on the palate, with 4.9% ABV being noticable. It might be brewed ""in the craft tradition"" like the description says, but it’s too fizzy and unbalanced to be taken too seriously."

Gulder Lager (Ghana);Kumasi, Ghana;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guinness Ghana Breweries;My third Third World pale lager in three days and my devotion to racking up a healthy country tick count is showing somes signs of strain. First of all, it seems to be some sort of west African tradition to sell massive 625ml bottles when a sampler would do me just fine, but I guess no one said this was going to be an easy job. Just buckle down and get through it. Pours clear gold from the bottle and leaves a white head of relatively short retention. Aroma is cereal, a bit of honey. Taste is lightly sweet, finish is short with a light grainy bitterness. The palate is nice — smooth and refreshing. But overall this is a fairly generic pale lager without a lot of character. Still over half the bottle left and my mood is souring. A really bad beer would be easy — drainpour and the next please. But this one is just over the border of pale lager decency. It tortures you with golden reproach — I came all the way from Africa, I’m drinkable, you can’t just throw me down the drain! You paid more for me than some people in Ghana earn in a day. And still it sits there, big and massive, and now it’s going flat. It’s not going to get any better. And there is a black IPA waiting in the fridge. Do I want to spend my whole alcohol for the night on this? Thank God there’s always the wife to bail me out of problems like this.
Gulder Lager (Ghana);Kumasi, Ghana;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guinness Ghana Breweries;625 ml bottle drunk at Roots Hotel, Accra. We are in macro territory and this one is not the worst of the bunch: well-carbonated, not too metallic and even some bitterness. OK.

Gulder Lager (Ghana);Kumasi, Ghana;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guinness Ghana Breweries;I think this brew is a bit superior to Star lager, the only other Ghanian beer I've had the opportunity to sample. Still essentially the same style - euro macro lager - but in this case, features less adjunct presence. Pours a bronzed golden color, just looks faded and not as appealing as others. Aroma is grainy malt, grassy hops, but also some skunkiness. Taste is a grainy and sweet maltiness, a faint hint of adjuncts but only if you look for it, not too bad. Flavor is a bit weak and thin, just a macro lager that avoids drifting too far in the adjunct direction. Hoppiness is light and pleasant, drinkable but nothing exceptional. On par with the standard euro lagers.
Gulder Lager (Ghana);Kumasi, Ghana;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guinness Ghana Breweries;Bottle. Pours a clear golden beer with a big white head on top. Aroma is very skunky, malty and cardboard.

Lang-Bräu ErotikBier;Wunsiedel-Schönbrunn, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Lang Bräu Schönbrunn;"""Das Bier der Nacht"", with camp label depicting an undressing lady and something similar on the cap... Regular, delicate, snow white, sticky head, colour orangey golden blonde (old gold), cristal clear with very modest sparkling. Sweetish malt aroma, cheesy hops, unfortunately a bit lightstruck too (cat piss). Simple, smooth malt sweetness in the taste, thinnish because of underachieving carbonation (already apparent in the lack of sparkling), bit oily mouthfeel, some grassy, quickly fading hops in the finish. Guess I liked the packing more than the content, and I have the impression that this is what this product is all about."

Pours a crystal clear, pale yellow colored body with an inch thick, foamy and frothy, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is somewhat sweet and bready pils malts with touches of straw and some green apple acetaldehyde. Flavor is similar. On the sweeter side with some bread, a very light grass, some fruits, and acetaldehyde. Finishes fairly clean and somewhat dry with a very light bitterness. Short aftertaste following a light body and a moderately lively carbonation. Overall, obviously the label was the selling point, but as for the beer, it was just okay. Clean enough to keep it easy drinking, but on the sweeter side for a Helles. Not terrible though.

Archers Keenes Oatmeal Stout;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Stout;Archers (Evan Evans);(on cask at the Market Porter, Southwark) beautifully thick, smooth and malty, but let down by a pointlessly obtrusive thin hop note at the finish that didn''t need to be there. nice tan froth. full textured but you can still gulp it down pretty industriously if you want.
Archers Dark Mild;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Mild Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask conditioned at a Wetherspoons. Dark brown with beige head. Sweet thin and malty, almost bready in character. Too sweet to be a quaffer, which is what a mild is supposed to be. Some dark roasted bitterness in the background, pretty average.

Archers Dark Mild;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Mild Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask at Cockney Pub, Århus. A pitch black beer with a brown head. The aroma is sweet with a strong roasted note, that gives it hints of acidity. The flavor is sweet malty and very roasted, combined with light notes of chocolate, again the hard roasted malt gives it hints of acidity. No wonder the body is thin.

Archers Dark Mild;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Mild Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask at GBBF 06’: tastes very fresh, great roasty flavor, quite light bodied, the only bad thing is some light unpleasent rotten and skunky flavor, but still a nice mild with a dry finish.

Terminal Gravity IPA;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;IPA;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Medium gold pour, tenacious thin white head, little lace. Nose is malt and wood. Middle is a little orange marmalade (bitter side), touch straight caramel, a wood pulp bitterness, solid malt backbone. Finish is bitter, little length. Classic, but something different.
Terminal Gravity IPA;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;IPA;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;12 oz bottle gifted by luttonm. Thanks! Can't believe I haven't rated this one. It's probably a beer I haven't had since before my rating days, so I shouldn't be too surprised. A more dense appearance, a copper pour, a touch cloudy. The grain is one the slightly sweeter side, and bready. Hops are subtle, and have a citrus fruit like hint. Rind like bitterness. The malt and hop combination is interesting for sure. Quite a tasty IPA. Easy to enjoy this one.
Terminal Gravity IPA;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;IPA;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle given to me by neighbor. Good neighbor! First few sips are fine, then weirdly, this beer lost its mojo. Towards the end I strangely could not tell what the hell I was drinking. Huh? Oh well, free beer is good beer!
Terminal Gravity IPA;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;IPA;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;355ml bottle. Pours a hazy copper with a small, creamy, long lasting, off-white head that laces nicely. Sweet aroma of peach, apricot, caramel malt and bread. Sweet flavour of caramel malt, toasted malt, grapefruit, grass, spice and pine with a dry, bitter, resiny finish. Medium body with an oily texture and soft carbonation. Very malty ipa, unbalanced and kind of weird but still ok.
Terminal Gravity IPA;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;IPA;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Tap at 6th Street. Copper color with white head. This IPA leaned toward the mail side. Light on bitterness . Quite drinkable.
Terminal Gravity IPA;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;IPA;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Bottle. Aroma is green olive and citrus. Taste is heavy malt but still delicious. Really, really heavy malt. Bitterness is just right though. Exceptionally unbalanced, yet there is something about the flavor that is drawing me in. Enjoyable and weird.
Terminal Gravity IPA;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;IPA;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Bottle A: Dark red - mostly opaque. Thin drifting off white head. Lacing. N: Toasted malt, pine, grapefruit, biscuit, some bark, damp autumn leaves, onion, burnt brown sugar, and peppercorn. T: Quite bitter, lightly burnt, lightly sweet. M: Medium body, very prickly carbonation, light alcohol burn. O: Throwback IPA. Dry with a big malt bite and the ’characteristic’ lack of intense dry hopping. Still, quite nice.
Terminal Gravity IPA;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;IPA;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;From a 355ml bottle on 10/3/2016. Pours a slightly cloudy golden with a small head, Has a muted aroma of caramel, honey, some citrus fruit and an odd slightly chemical smell. Take a sip and there’s a bit of sweet caramel malt, lots of sharp sweet and sour citrus, a bit of spice, followed by a big, quite astringent bitterness. The texture is a touch syrupy and the carbonation is soft. This is a bit of a weird one. Not at all typical of a west coast IPA, and comes across as a little unbalanced. On the bright side, it did begin to charm me just a little towards the end.
Terminal Gravity IPA;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;IPA;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Bottle from Beer Cartel, Sydney. A fairly deep copper-amber colour with a small and fading off-white to light beige head on the pour. Aromas of pine, resin, tropical fruits and sweet-accented malt. Similar to taste wth a slight toastiness from the malt towards the back end. Mid-weight with definite malt heft but maintains a crisp, refreshing texture. Medium carbonation finishing with a moderate to full intensity and length bitterness.
Terminal Gravity IPA;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;IPA;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Bottle from Beer Cartel 050316. First beer from Terminal Gravity Brewing Company and judging by this beer I will be back for more. Full bodied and full favoured with just the right amount of hops.
Foxburg Inn Dark Bock;Foxburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Foxburg Inn on the Allegheny;Draught. This beer looks like a nice dark bock, but doesn’t taste like one. That being said, it is pretty good with some sweet malt and average body. Not bad stuff, but I wouldn’t call it bock.
Foxburg Inn Dark Bock;Foxburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Foxburg Inn on the Allegheny;Very weak aroma but I could at least detect some hops/malt. No head, light brown and a bit cloudy (chill haze?). Served in a chilled mug. Medium fizzy palate - watery. Tasted like a regular lager - good hops, but certainly not enough malt to be a bock IMHO.
Bitter End Hop Harvest Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;2004 batch. I was able to bring a growler of this to the pre-GABF party at Logan’s.

Bitter End Hop Harvest Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Nice full aroma. Lots of hops with hay/barn/fresh cut grass and tips of parsley. Lots of hull flavors on the back end that don't seem to work and yet it grows on me. After a taste of the lineup, this is the beer I went back to.
Bitter End Hop Harvest Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Also known as ""hop harvest"". Something of a miss...they have much hoppier beers than this, and the malts kind of peter out toward the finish to leave a strange minty sort of flavor. Definitely not one of Bitter End''s better beers."
Bitter End Hop Harvest Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Didnt taste much different than their imperial pale. Just a lot of hops thrown in....nothing that would give me wood.
Bitter End Rye Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Midnight black, tan head that clings to the glass as it dissipates. Hints of rye and roasted coffee in the aroma, which follow through pretty well in the hearty flavor. The first rye beer of any kind that I''ve enjoyed.
Bitter End Rye Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Looked great, dark, pretty brown head. Nice, coffee aroma. Dry, coffee, hints of cocoa in taste. It kind of gave off a chalky taste that turned me off.
Kuhnhenn Metry's Winter Lager;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap at Kuhnhenn, from notes. Pours golden with a medium sized off white head. The aroma and flavor had pale bready malts, grains, lager malt, pales next to the bigger beers.

Clear golden color with a sustainable white head. Light palate with decent carbonation. Probably the lightest beer of theirs I’ve had with the exception of the Bohemian Pilsner. Grainy malts with a little straw and a decent bitter finish. Well blended and deceptively strong.
Kuhnhenn Metry's Winter Lager;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"Tap: hazed, sunshine-gold body with a super fine-bubbled layer of creamy foam that sits on top for days, leaving a huge sheet of lacing all around the glass. Aroma is certainly lager-like; fresh grains, baked bread, crisp yeast, sharp with some spicy Noble hops in the back & a mild twinge of DMS. Taste is smooth & crisp with earthy & spicy hops, undertones of sweet baked bread, light honey, & a mild inclusion of lemon-y, citrus zest. Finishes clean, as a lager should, leaving only a slight bit of bread & yeast behind. Don’t understand the hate on this one, it’s a very nice, enjoyable lager."

Kuhnhenn Metry's Winter Lager;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kuhnhenn Brewing;The only reason that this beer is rated so poorly is probably becqause it was at winter solstice and there are a bunch of idiots with no palates that attend.

Kuhnhenn Sticke Alt;Warren, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Bottled. Yummy, some really great burnt plastic aromas here, and sticky caramel plus abundance of spicy hallertauer make this pretty trad - but then you throw in a sourish yeast component from the bottle conditioning and you have an interesting beer.

Wisconsin Dells Dunkel Lager;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Sampled on draught at the brewpub/restaurant in Wisconsin Dells.

Finish is slightly bitter with a creamy and bready chocolate aftertaste.
Wisconsin Dells Dunkel Lager;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;On-tap @ the Brewpub. Deep mahogany color and a nice tan head of foam that leaves sheets of lacing behind it. Aroma of dark chocolate and toasted munich-style malts. Light roasted malt flavor for bitterness and some rich chocolate in the flavor. Nutty aspect reminded me a lot of a rich nut brown ale. Medium-to-full bodied and quite smooth. Says on the menu that this won a Silver medal at the Great American Beer Festival. I can see why.
Wisconsin Dells Dunkel Lager;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;(Tap) Pours dark brown with little head.

Wisconsin Dells Oaktoberfest;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;On draft at the brewpub, Oct. 2013. Labeled as a Vienna on the menu(?). Sweet, malty aroma, plenty of toasted caramel, breadiness and slight fruitiness, some very mild hop spice as well. Uncharacteristically hazy orange-amber color, head is subsiding. Flavor is fairly sweet and malty as well, more caramel present along with a light-moderate degree of hop bitterness and some toasted bread character, no fruitiness in the flavor profile to speak of, however. Smooth and low in effervescence, fairly thin, in fact, with a light-medium body. Faint degree of hop spiciness appearing late. This was just okay.
Wisconsin Dells Oaktoberfest;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;"Golden color visible caronation, dense thick white head. Smells like a typical fest, full of sweet grains, strongest aroma in their beers that I tried. Average palate. Tyical fest flavor profile, a bit more watereed down thatn I like feels like it needs to be bigger some finishing sweetness lingers. An ""OK"" beer."
Wisconsin Dells Oaktoberfest;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;"Draft at OF...listed as ""Dells Oktoberfest"". Thick brown orange color, minimal head. Hmm..this one seems a little bit off. Light-medium bodied brown malt flavor. No real Oktoberfest characteristics, light choco-brown syrup taste. Not so impressive, certainly not to style. Creamy and malt centered. Maybe too heavy handed with the Chocolate malt. Reminiscent of Saranac Chocolate Amber."
Wisconsin Dells Oaktoberfest;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Sampled on draught at the brewpub in Wisconsin Dells. Pours a dark golden amber brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that leaves behind a white ring and some spotty lacing. Aroma of multi-grain biscuits, some candi sugar and a touch of flowery hops. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with flavors of malty biscuits and some toasted caramel malt. Finish is semi-sweet, with an aftertaste of toated biscuits and a hint of light bitterness. This year’s batch is at 5.5% abv. Nice Märzen!

Wisconsin Dells Oaktoberfest;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Not aged in oak - the lady pouring the beer says it’s named Oaktoberfest because it sounds cute. Yeah, that’s f’in adorable. On with business... Nice opulent caramel brown color with tan saliva wisps serving as the head. Admirable nutty sweetness in the nose, complimented by maple and brown sugar and cocoa powder shaken over pecans. Palate feel is void of carbonation. Flavor elements resemble the nose, taking a tiny back step from the progress made earlier. Some liquefied brown sugar flavors along with a character trait that reminds me of Honey Bunches of Oats. Maple oats finish. Pretty good, just needs to work on that carbonation.

Toasty malt aroma with a touch of caramel and earthy hops. Sweet malt start with dark caramel. Toasty malt linger and finish. Sweetness sticks out a touch too much at times. but nice brew overall.

Point Belgian White;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;Pretty average wheat beer. Typical orange peel, coriander and banana notes.

Point Belgian White;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;355ml bottle. Mostly clear golden colour with a small creamy white head, looks suspiciously like a lager. Mild aroma, the wheat and orange peel, and a small amount of coriander, isn’t strong at all. Again the flavour is very mild for a wheat beer, with the wheat there’s a light citrus taste, hops, yeast. Fairly watery mouthfeel. Overall this felt really ’light’ for a wheat beer, not much different to a lager, it’s not at all bad but it’s disappointing.

Magic Hat Thumbsucker Imperial Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Gift from S.J. Nice notes of choclate, roast, spice and moleasses. I would have liked it to be a bit more fuller in the body, but this was a solid brew.
Magic Hat Thumbsucker Imperial Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Masterski and his love of obscure ticks. Thanks a bunch Alex! It’s getting to that point in the night when my reviews go to shit. Dark brown/black in color with some reddish brown hues around the edges of the glass. Nose is comprised of mellow bourbon, chocolate, malt, and oak. Taste follows the nose, bourbon, chocolate, and oak. Mouthfeel is smooth, with light carbonation, and a short to medium finish. Better than I thought it would be, what happened to Magic Hat?
Magic Hat Thumbsucker Imperial Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Bottle from Max’s in Baltimore. Shared with Masterski. Pours near-black with a thin head of tan-ish bubbles that doesn’t hang around for too long. Perhaps a thin collar for at least a bit. The nose is really nice, bringing some oak and vanilla along with some roasted malt. Some chocolate in the background as well. Really nice and integrated, though no real bourbon character; instead, just the oak. The flavor adds in a good bit of booze. There’s roast and chocolate there as well. The oak and vanilla aren’t as prevalent as in the nose. The heat certainly takes it down a notch from where the nose was, which is surprising given the age and the fact that this is fairly-low in alcohol. Body is medium with light carbonation and a bit of booze through the finish. Overall, pretty good and I’m very glad I finally got to try this one."

Magic Hat Thumbsucker Imperial Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle courtesy of Lubiere: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a small dark brown foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of fruit cake with light port notes. Taste has probably lost some of the characteristics related to an imperial stout due to aging which have been replaced with nice notes of port and fruit cake with light dry roasted malt notes still perceptible. Description mentions bourbon aging though I can’t say that I could taste any notes of bourbon. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Still good after all those years but I have to wonder what I fresh version would taste like.
Magic Hat Thumbsucker Imperial Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottled in 2004: A deep dark stout with a thin mocha brown head. In aroma, a smooth maderized chocolate, with dark fruits, maraschino, light tannins. In mouth, a smooth sweet chocolate with roasted coffee, light maderization, soy, nice and smoth, light corky notes, very nice for a 7 year old beer. Tasted Oct. 21 2011 with GRM and Boutip.
Magic Hat Thumbsucker Imperial Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From Notes sampled 11/11/2007 I bought a growler or two from the brewery. Pours an opaque brown/black with a very minimal tan head, very low carbonation here. Aroma comes through with strong bourbon and alcohol and some dried fruits. Tastes almost port like with some roasted malt bitterness. Raisins and bourbon come through as well. Mouthfeel is thinnner than I expected, but leaves a roasty figgy aftertaste. A great RIS very complex beer. I’m not sure I believe that this beer is 7.8% abv might be artificially low to get around Vermont’s ancient beer laws. I wish they would bottle this again so I could see how it ages.
Magic Hat Thumbsucker Imperial Stout;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Imperial;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Draft and growler serving some time in 2007 when i day tripped up to the brewery. I was told the etoh was closer to 11-12% and what i was drinking was in the barrel close to 4 years. One beer not to be taken lightly. This colossal imperial stout poured like black ink with a tin dark brown lacing that quickly dissipated. Huge dark chocolate malt and bourbon in the nose. Even more so in the taste with a big warming alcohol character and some light vanilla. Viscous on the boarder of syrupy. This beer is awesome. We had a sick time camping out in the woods for Reuben’s birthday with this brew.
