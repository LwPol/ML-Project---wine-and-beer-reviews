Broughton Greenmantle Ale (Bottle);Biggar, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Broughton Ales;500ml bottle from Co-Op on the Isle of Arran. Pours copper red with a bubbly head which calms down to a small, off white layer of froth. Smells quite earthy, malty and fruity. Tastes initially quite crisp, green apple with a toffee finish. Gets more complex as it goes down and I’m getting other fruits of the darker kind but a sort of caramel, apple dessert taste is never far away. I have to be honest, this started off a bit disappointing but by the bottom of the glass I’m desperate for more. Lovely.

Broughton Merlin's Ale (Bottle);Biggar, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Broughton Ales;Highly enjoyable! This one is amber and pours a very small, short-lived head - perfect for the style. You get a pretty profound malty aroma with some caramel and vanilla, apples and pears, whiskey and just a minuscule hint of vinegar. On the tongue, I detect quite assertive bitterness - more than usual for the style and nearly as much as many ESBs can boast. This beer is juicey, quaffable, not too thin. A slightly floral finish even adds some complexity. My overall verdict: an excellent 'pub-style' pint, proving that standard bitters can be as good as many of their more alcoholic cousins.

Gearys American Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;D.L. Gearys Brewing Co.;Geary’s American Ale pour to a beautiful, bright, pale golden color with a nice white head, and a good bit of carbonation. The nose is very fragrant with zesty/cirtic hop aromas, some nice pale malt aroma, and earthy aroma from the distinctive Ringwood yeast used in the brewing of Geary’s beers. The palate is firm with a good base of pale and biscuit malt flavors. This is coupled with a subtle back drop of buttery flavor, another by product of the Ringwood yeast strain. Geary’s American Ale finishes with a short, dry, mild hop bitterness that lingers. This is an outstanding golden ale, with a nice balance of hop and malt character. This beer is a natural with sea food, and makes the perfect foil for a boiled Maine lobster with drawn butter. This beer is hard to find outside of Maine, and New England, but is one well worth looking for. Love the patriotic lobster with the American flag on the label as well.

Gearys American Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;D.L. Gearys Brewing Co.;Aroma was overbearingly hoppy. I think they used a few too many aroma hops. This also loses some points for having chill haze (first I've ever seen in a commercial brew). It went uphill from there though, tasting quite nicely hopped (not overpowering), and finished well. Short lasting, hoppy aftertaste.

Color is a hazy gold with good carbonation and a rocky white head. Aroma is hoppy with a back note of malt. It has a medium body with a crisp mouth feel. Flavor is malt, a slight fruitiness, then a nice bitter kick. After taste is more bitterness and hop spice that gives white pepper.

Sweet malty caramel nose, light citrus. Clear gold/copper color, frothy head which descends into lines of thin cirrus clouds. Hard hit of caramel at first, then a soft saggy pillow of bittering. The malt seems musty and earthy. Medium-heavy body. Perfunctory nose. Big malty flavors but, as above, not completely pleasant.
Fish Tale Organic Amber Ale;Olympia, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;Seems more like a pale ale to me than an amber, but could just be a lighter-hoppy amber. Smooth feel, pretty crisp, decent flavor....not bad for my first sample from Fish Tale. Something light for my warm-up drink before my drive to Superbowl Party! Would pair good with different kinds of food too. Good beer that I would get again, figuring I only sampled one to try. If you like beer (pale ales or IPAs) don't even bother reading the bad ratings, as there is nothing wrong with this one.... Water, barley, and hops.....that's it....how bad can it be?

The aroma is less hoppy and more earthy caramel. Medium bodied and a touch raspy in terms of carbonation. The taste is malt-forward with caramel, cocoa, tobacco leaf and some sweet citrus thrown in for good measure.

T: Caramel malt flavor with toasty bread and a thin sweetness. I do still get and like the earthy hallertau flavor. Tastes kind of watery overall. Not very complex but the beer is very cold. The slight nuttiness from the nose opens up a bit as it warms.Also a faint piney note but too little too late flavorwise to save this from mediocrity. M: Thin feel and slightly lacking in carbonation, however the sweet note lingers a bit. O: Really wanted to get into this since it’s certified organic, but nothing wows me here.

The aroma picked up toasted bready malts topped by a lovely pinch of lemon zest.. great balance of sweet and tangy. The flavor found fruity notes, honey, and sourdough bread at the core with earthy, floral, and lemony bitterness around.. bright and tasty.. well-balanced.

Sandy and toasty, with some light sweet malt and non-aggressive hops. There is some English flavor in there, fruity with a touch of that fining taste, though I would doubt they are used.

Oranjeboom Pilsener Lager (UK);Breda, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Dutch Breweries;Not a live review per se but a call back to the many times I've downed some cans of this over the years. Not seen very often on tap around my parts, but have imbibed many cans. All in all, it is a pretty inoffensive lager, but has a citrusy, alcoholic bite that is missing from most mass-produced canned lager. Nowadays I avoid like the plague, though.
Oranjeboom Pilsener Lager (UK);Breda, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Dutch Breweries;On keg at The Hoop and Grapes, City of London, UK. It pours clear yellow, with a small white head. Aroma is artificial orange and malts at most. Taste is light sweet and light bitter. Body is light, carbonation is average. Not liked it...

Oranjeboom Pilsener Lager (UK);Breda, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Dutch Breweries;"Draught in Rochester ; Nothing too wrong or right with this , a ’mid-card’ pale lager ... On the sweeter side of things in style context ,i like swill lager to be more bitter as the redemption for being shitty. Notes of grain, hay, cut grass, sugar , apple ester , light caramel, metal ."

Oranjeboom Pilsener Lager (UK);Breda, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Dutch Breweries;On tap in Hawkinge, Kent. What a waste of time. Watery so-called beer with no aroma. Looks simple and tastes like nothing. Bad. Very bad.
Thames Welsh ESB;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Felinfoel Brewery;"I found this on the sweeter side as well, which is fine because I am not too fond of ESBs. Appearance is a cloudy medium brown...a little darker than apple cider but not as cloudy. Fruity aroma, like banana with that hard to describe European yeasty smell. Reminded me sort of like a Belgian. Tastes of caramal malts with toffee...fruits, hmmm..., I'm going with blackberry, banana, possibly hints of grape or cherry? Still had a medium amount of bitterness, but I wouldn't say ""extra"". Good balance of malts and hops on this one. I would buy again, but a little pricey. Will look out for it though if ever traveling, especially overseas."
Thames Welsh ESB;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Felinfoel Brewery;"""not a bad little bitter. a little sweet...light fruit and tofee, and a very delicate hop aroma and flavor with a hint of bittersweet in the finish. not the first thing I’d grab, but not bad either."""
Thames Welsh ESB;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Felinfoel Brewery;The pour was a cloudy deep reddish brown with a 1.5-finger off-white head that dissipated quickly. The aroma was toffee with a hint of holiday fruitcake. The flavor was toasty, nutty and a good dose of caramel malts. Slight hints of figs and ripe cherries just before the hops become noticeable. Herbal, resiny hops, but not a lot of bitterness. Overall, fairly well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is medium, as well.
Thames Welsh ESB;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Felinfoel Brewery;"Cloudy dark ruby amber with a persistent light head and streaks of lace. Malt and strong dark fruit (almost cough syrup); light bittering, no solid trace of hops. Somewhat heavy and filling. Overal good for a change."
Thames Welsh ESB;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Felinfoel Brewery;Gift from SJ. I liked this brew. A nice blend of roast, fruit and caramel malt. A mild hint of sugar, toffee in the dry finish. Well done.
Thames Welsh ESB;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Felinfoel Brewery;"Aroma is malts, fruit and slightly funky. The flavor is malts, a mixture of several fruits, raspberry, grape, apple, etc. This was more complex, a bit all over the place compared to other ESBs; it was decent as a whole didn’t seem to have a cohesive flavor, with some of the flavors kind of colliding and not balancing each other."
Thames Welsh ESB;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Felinfoel Brewery;Pours a gorgeous mahogany, topped with a fluffy white head which leaves beautiful lacing down the glass. The aroma is rich fruit, like whisky soaked currants waiting to be folded into christmas pudding. Taste is loads of toffee, cut through with a sharp bitterness with leaves a long dry finish that simply delights. Medium to full body, well integrated alcohol. Lovely beer.
Thames Welsh ESB;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Felinfoel Brewery;bottled. pours a murky brown with a medium head. it smells of chocolate and caramel. it has medium sweetness, with very little hoppy bitterness. overall a very well balanced beer with good flavor and finish.
Thames Welsh ESB;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Felinfoel Brewery;A brown pour with white head and lace. Aroma of dried fruit and caramel malt dominate. Semi sweet caramel malt and just a hint of abv. Medium bodied but just a tad fizzy. Very decent beer.
Thames Welsh ESB;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Felinfoel Brewery;Appearance: Pours a clouded body the color of fine, aged leather. Modest-sized head of large, dissipating suds. Smell: Cut hardwood planks layered with sweet-scented caramel and toffee and a good whiff of holidaytime fruitcake splashed here and there with bottled bitters. Taste: Lightly toasty, nutty, even woody maltiness with a big boost of candyish toffee sweetness. Noted fruity esters tasting of figs and tart cherries. Herbaceous, resiny hops with more than enough bitterness to ride out until the dry, mineral-hinted, earthy finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Low carbonation. Drinkability: A good, decent Welsh ESB and a pleasant early-evening brew, though there are a few others I’d sooner reach out my grubby hands for.
Marathon;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Pours a clear golden honey color with a thick white head. Aroma is dry dusty straw. Flavor has sweet cereal, straw and corn. Mouthfeel is medium and the finish is sweet and corny/cerealy/syrupy. Not good.
Marathon;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Botella de 33 cl desde Grecia via beni. Tomada en julio de 2007. ( fecha de cons pref para 12-2007) suave con 5 vol y sin ningún problema para beber, de las comerciales. Sin mucho o casi nada que resaltar.
Marathon;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Bottle: Pours clear, dark gold/scotch with a thin, soapy head. Scent is sweet corn, caramel... Grain, honey taste....bready.... Stale sugar, malt....Not terrible, but on the edge of unpleasant..... Still, a fairly strong body for a pale lager.
Marathon;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Serving: Bottle from State Line Liquors. It pours a clear gold color with a small white head. The nose has a good dose of grain sweetness, but not much else. The flavor is mild with light malt sweetness, a touch of grain, and honey. Not much in the way of bitterness, but easy to drink with no offensive notes. Certainly better than Aris, the only other Greek beer I’ve had.
Marathon;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Drank rite from the brown bottle but I can see its just a pale lager appearance. Somewhat metallic aroma. Seems a little uncivilized at first for a pale lager. Yes, some bitter shit in there and I’m thinking this approaches the taste of a domestic cheap ice beer. Good co2 sizzle makes this at least avereage. Fairly watery in construct. Goes down pretty easy, but there still is this background mild nag. Not bad over all but a little less smooth than anticipated.
Marathon;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Bottle at the hungry Greek next to my place, drank from bottle, aromas of rice, and dust. Flavors are the same, light overall, not the best beer out there, but wouldn’t order again.
Marathon;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Bottle with Maggi and Geoff at the Greek restaurant in ybor the night before Hunahpu 2013. Pours a clear, light golden body with fizzy carbonated bubbles and short, frothy white head. Aroma is sweet grain, light fruity malts, very faint skunk and rice. Mouthfeel is light, carbonated and somewhat crisp. Similar characteristics in the flavor, very plain but not offensive in any way. A drinkable pale lager if no other options are available.
Marathon;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Bottle as shown. Pours a clear pale gold with small white head leaving spotty lacing. The aroma is a sweet corn malt and honey. Thin mouthfeel with a skunky corn malt and metallic finish. Not much going on with this one.

Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Pale Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);From old tasting notes. Hazy gold color. Big bubbly white head. Perfumy citrus malt aroma. Sweet tangy malt flavor is fruity and crisp. Brief sour finish.
Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Pale Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);weak aromas of hay, grass, and tin can. the taste is reminiscent of a cross between a lager and a golden ale. got a little bit of barnyard funk. unfortunately not much in the hops department. ice cold on a hot humid summer day is the way to go here.
Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Pale Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12-ounce bottles in a glass. A little boring, but that’s standard with Pale Ales. Not bad, especially for the price, but I would pick the Private Reserve from the same company before this one.
Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Pale Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours a clear golden color with a bubbly white head that dissipated quickly. The aroma is sweet malts, sugar, white bread, and some mild hops. The taste is lightly toasted barley, white bread, cereal, and mild hops to help balance. The mouthfeel is light and the drinkability is super high. I really enjoyed this beer.
Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Pale Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Couldn’t tell the difference between this and a lager. Not sure what makes it an APA. Not much aroma and taste, kind of bland.
Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Pale Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Gaga Lok and this is just another yellow piss beer from the PacNW. Tastes like it should basically.
Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Pale Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"""cleaner than many pales, but that is because it’s a thoroughly weak interpretation of the style. standard macro attempt at a microbrew style. boring."""
Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Pale Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with yellow tints around the edges of the glass. The head was about a film of a white cap. There was barely any lacing. The smell had a light spice somewhat like black pepper but not off putting, just different. There’s a light caramel malt gently coming in as it warmed. The taste was mainly malty sweet with the spice to come back secondly. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. There’s a quick spicy aftertaste and finish. Overall, APA, uh....sure, it’s a different one alright but nothing bad.
Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Pale Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Bottle at The Burrito House (PDX). Sugary sweet malt nose. Pale straw color. Sweet, cookieish maltiness, very light citrus hop, light cake frosting finish. Thin. Claims to be brewed with Cascade hops, but they are not detectable. This was the only beer on the menu that I hadn’t tried before, and so I gave it a go. Pretty ""crafty"" stuff."
Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Pale Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle. Nose is noticeably hoppy, but the hops smell more like pepper than one of the traditional hop flavors. Taste isn’t all that bitter, but there’s a little bite to it, along with a faint hint of citrus. Not a lot of substance to the flavor, but drinkable.
Coast Range Belgian White;Gilroy, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Coast Range Brewing Company;Light yellow color, slightly cloudy. Large head. Light hops and malts. Mild taste, somewhat lemony, not a lot of flavor. Finish is mild and lemony. Aftertaste is somewhat bitter. Not a very good example of a Belgian white.

Hook Norton Old Hooky (Bottle);Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hook Norton Brewery;Noch ein Bier aus der Bier-Index-Verkostungsbox von 2013 Dieses Bier war etwas schwer einzuteilen. Auf der einen Seite nette hopfige Aromen, dann ein tiefer, malziger Körper und dann noch ein paar fruchtige Aromen. Und zum drüberstreuen etwas Röstmalz-Geschmack. Alles ganz gut geformte Geschmäcker, aber dadurch wirkte das Bier sehr überladen und übertrieben. Hier wäre weniger wohl wirklich mehr gewesen.

Karl Strauss Brig Brew Golden Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Draft at Brigantine La Mesa. Deep yellow pour with a foamy head. Aromas are malty and bready. Flavors were more pale malt with some golden ale bitterness. Just eh
Karl Strauss Brig Brew Golden Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;From the tap at Brigatine Seafood poured golden with a good amount of head. Light sweet malty flavor with a lingering finish.
Karl Strauss Brig Brew Golden Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Nose is mildly biscuity and smells of crisp hops. Pours more light orange than gold with a soapy head. Flavor is initially hoppy, a citrus lemon kind of thing followed by bready malt. That is it. A mild hoppiness and coaty mouthfeel lingers for a bit, but it is still pretty light bodied. Pretty average really.
Karl Strauss Brig Brew Golden Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Very light nose of pale malt. Some lightly roasted malt sweetness, with caramel and toffee notes, but pretty tame really. Very spritzy carbonation tricks you into thinking a bit more is going on here than there really is. A very, very light ale.
Julius Echter Hefe-Weissbier Hell;Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Würzburger Hofbräu (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Excellent wheat beer. Clean, sharp acidity characteristic of the type, and none of the burnt taste that mediocre ones have.
Julius Echter Hefe-Weissbier Hell;Würzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Würzburger Hofbräu (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Bottle - Cloudy golden amber, high carbonation giving large white head, but dissipates to thin line. Strong yeasty aroma. Good mouthfeel. Strong initial orange tasting - decent finish.Easy drinking hefe.
Dukes Big Ass Beer (Hefeweizen);Camino, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;"""how is this a big ass beer? don’t ask me. a little bitter for a wheat, which isn’t a great flavor, but at least it makes it stand out a little from all the others that all taste the same."""
Dukes Big Ass Beer (Hefeweizen);Camino, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Pours from a large swing-top bottle hazy golden with a pretty white head. and a floral citrus aroma. It looks nice, but the flavor is disappointing. Kind of a thin skunky hay taste with a dusty finish.
Dukes Big Ass Beer (Hefeweizen);Camino, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;~Pours a cloudy gold with white head. ~Aroma of banana, clove and yeast. ~Sweet banana clove flavor. ~Medium fizzy, frothy feel. Bittersweet finish. ~Enjoyable Hefe. Above average.
Dukes Big Ass Beer (Hefeweizen);Camino, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;"22 oz. bottle - wow, poor ratings be damned but this was a great brew; pours bright gold and very cloudy; light carbonation and thin white head; strong and smooth aromas of lemons, wheat and yeast; wonderful texture and full bodied flavor; lots of sweetness; yummy"
Dukes Big Ass Beer (Hefeweizen);Camino, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;This is from a 12 oz bottle purchased from Corti Bros in Sacramento, CA. Poured a cloudy pale orange with almost no head. Nose is sour and kind of like a horse blanket. Not much mouthfeel. But it is the flavor that stops you in your tracks. It is awful. I am not sue what is in this but it is about as awful tasting a beer as I have seen in a long time. Both my brother and I were in complete agreement...this is a drainpour if you ever saw one. Gag.
Dukes Big Ass Beer (Hefeweizen);Camino, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Hmm... I did not think this was that bad really. For what it was. Poured a hazy orange brown with almost no head. Aroma of wheat, oranges, and light yeast. The flavor was much the same. Nice light orange accompanied by a little sweet fruit and a generic cereal wheat. Kind of thin, medium carbonation. It could have been a lot worse.
Dukes Big Ass Beer (Hefeweizen);Camino, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;12 ounce bottle purchased from Corti Brothers in Sacramento, CA. Aroma is a bit sour, metallic, and musty. Kind of strange for a hefe. Moderately hazy golden-orange body with a medium, fluffy, manilla head. Fair lacing. Thin, lightly sweet, grainy start. There is some mild lemon citrus flavors towards the end. This is very undercarbonated, cardboardy, and very underattenuated. It’s really quite boring. Very rarely will I encourage a person to throw fruit in their weissbiers, but this is a beer in which I would totally approve of that practice with.
Dukes Big Ass Beer (Hefeweizen);Camino, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;The aroma is not banana. It is more like citrus hop (or feline ....). Hazy golden color with a white head that filmed, leaving lace tatters. Very thin in body, light, almost creamy, carbonation. The flavor is indeed something glandular, with some clove and mephistolphian accompanyments. The finish is something metallic, with some citric aspects. The finish is astringently dry, and the mouth is not left in a happy condition. Strange stuff. PIne accents appear upon continued assumption (hence the earlier reference to cat ...?). Overall it is not really disgusting, it is just unexpected. So it is what it is. The mouth adjusts somewhat with the passage of time, hence the rating in excess of the average, I suppose.
Dukes Big Ass Beer (Hefeweizen);Camino, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;One and done about sums it up. The name peaked my curiosity so I bought the 32oz bottle w/ the flip cap. The marketing is much better than the beer.
Dukes Big Ass Beer (Hefeweizen);Camino, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Jack Russell Farm Brewery;Bottle: Whoa, look at those ratings!!! I’m going to be blowing this one away with a good review here. I got my bottle through the beer of the month club and found it to be a nice made hefe, not exceptional, but certainly not bad. Misty yellow, orange, thin head, nice lacing. Nose of sweet malt and honey, clean tart and citric esters (orange, clove). The flavor is a bit musky, some sweet honey and sulpher notes. Not bad, needs more hops. Finishes a bit tangy and musky.
Peter's Brand;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;United Dutch Breweries;Can, from Trader Joe's (6/15/19). Pours clear golden with small foamy white head, faint malt aroma, high carbonation, mildly bitter malt taste with grassy hops, thin body, abrupt finish. Good generic Pilsner.
Peter's Brand;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;United Dutch Breweries;Can from Trader Joe's in Campbell, CA. Aroma is wet grains, wet cardboard, American breakfast cereal, slightly farty with a touch of honey. Taste is rain-soaked cardboard. Strangely heavy.

Peter's Brand;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;United Dutch Breweries;I get this stuff at Trader Joe's sometimes. It's like 6.99 for 6 16 ounce cans or something, so it's a decent deal. But I prefer to get the other cheap beers over this one normally
Peter's Brand;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;United Dutch Breweries;.5l can pours clear amber with a thin anemic white head. Smells of straw, bread, banana. Taste adds a little floral note, straw bitterness, lemon rind. Crisp, light. Nothing amazing here.
Peter's Brand;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;United Dutch Breweries;500ml can on 1st Mar 2019. Laguna Hills. California, bought in a local Trader Joe's. Clear and clean golden body, snow white head. Grainy, malty nose and taste, not much hop action. OK for a cheap Pilsener.
Peter's Brand;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;United Dutch Breweries;1 pt.0.9oz from Trader Joes in Short Pump, VA the pils poured a clear amber color with a white head and limited lacing. The head had some lasting power. The aroma of crystal malts greets you. The pils has a light body with average carbonation. An easy beer to drink but light on the hops. The taste has more sweetness than desired. The finish was clean.
Peter's Brand;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;United Dutch Breweries;Passed up a few local ticks at a work dinner so for punishment bought this brew from Trader Joe’s that was next door. Dark gold. Nose is stale hops. Tastes of grains, old lemon, hay. Kinda weird tasting. I don’t like Trader Joe’s and I don’t like this beer.
Peter's Brand;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;United Dutch Breweries;I knew exactly what I was getting with this beer: something that I could chug down ice cold following a hot bike ride. It certainly worked fine for that purpose but it admittedly is not something I'd want to drink at any other point. It's thin, fizzy, and tastes like corn water. I happily didn't get a can that had the offensive metallic taste, but it definitely wasn't anything remarkable.
Peter's Brand;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;United Dutch Breweries;$1.17 pint can, Trader Joe's. Pours clear gold with a white head. Aroma of corn chips, corn. Flavor is watered down corn chips, hose water, light grass, paper. It's not as bad as I imagined, but not good.
Athenian;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);330ml bottle pours a pale golden color with a small white head that leaves a few specks of lacing on the glass. Aroma is light grains and hops. Taste is light malt sweetness and light hop bitterness. Light body and light carbonation. A decent brew for the style, but still nothing special.
Athenian;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Hmmm, just as I expected. Gold pour. White head. Skunky aroma with pale malt and hop profile. Flavor is much the same. I dont even think this would go well with much of anything.
Athenian;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Pours golden to light amber with white head that quickly dissipates. Nose has a suggestion of honey, and is otherwise faint. Palate has honeyed malt taste, light hops, and a short finish. Slight herbal/vegetal like quality. Very easy drinking, better than domestic adjunct lagers.
Athenian;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Had this beer a couple years ago, so I’m going off memory. It was an unusual find, so I had to try it. It was a little on the malty side, but almost like a German beer in flavor. Some corn and grassy hops, but light with enough flavor to be refreshing.
Athenian;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);330 mL. Found this at European Street Cafe in Jacksonville, FL. Pours a clear golden with a decent white head that dwindles down quickly. Aromas of sweet corn, fresh grass, and cereal. No lacing. Tastes like sweet corn bread. Clean, bland finish. This is a decent pale lager that I am not going to complain about. Fun to drink, not offensive, and hey! it’s Greek.
Athenian;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);11 oz. bottle. Pours a clear gold with a moderate white head that faded to a sloppy, uneven white film after the first sip and left zero lace. Aroma of stale air, like being in an old attic, along with some malt and a bit of corn syrup sweetness. Thankfully, there was no staleness in the flavor, which was basically some mild sweet malt. No bitterness to speak of at the finish. Fairly smooth on the palate. This beer probably would have faired better with me if not for the off-putting aroma.
Athenian;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Bottle. Pours a gold with an initial 2 finger snow white head that faded fast into a soap scum topper. Nose is sweet malt and grassy hops. Taste is pretty the same. Lighter mouth feel. Meh, not any worse than a lot of Latin beers.
Athenian;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);"mmm, so i’m rating pale lagers again--oh, boy: this one has that familiar egg whiteness to it that never fairs well with my palate; somewhat oily, some spice actually, but not great; meh."
Athenian;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Not all that interesting...this is a basic lager, slightly better than a typical American lager. There was some residual sweetness to this beer, which gave it most of its flavor and very low hopiness if any. Not bad for a session lager but nothing interesting at all with this beer.
Athenian;Athens, Greece;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Brewed in Greece !! Pours a golden yellow color with a quickly dissipating white head. Aroma of corn, malts, and a hint of citrus. The taste is of sweet corn but not much else. The mouthfeel is very watery that ends with a slightly dry finish. This pale lager is boring, but the label is kind of cool.
Hook and Ladder Backdraft Brown Ale;Silver Spring, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Hook and Ladder Brewing Company;Backdraft Brown is soda-like in color and head. The color is like Dr. Pepper: a dark copper brown, with dark orange highlights when held to the light. The head is a light tan, fizzy, that dissipates quickly and leaves a thin layer across the top of the beer. Smell is smoky, of dark roasted malts as well as some fruity yeast. Flavor is smoky as well, with just a suggestion of bitterness at the end. A thin and watery mouthfeel really detracts from the experience. Somewhat harsh carbonation. I had great expectations from the smell and flavor notes on the first sip, but the taste doesn’t follow through.
Hook and Ladder Backdraft Brown Ale;Silver Spring, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Hook and Ladder Brewing Company;It had a tan head of average size that fades quickly leaving only a little lacing. The body has a dark brown color with some nice ruby red highlights. The aroma has a big sweet, malty, bready character. The base flavor is malty and bready with some hints of darker roasted malt and modest, slightly citrusy hops. The hops add a good balance to the mostly malty character and finish with the beer with a pleasant soft bitterness. Its texture is smooth, slightly slick and medium bodied with light to average carbonation.
Hook and Ladder Backdraft Brown Ale;Silver Spring, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Hook and Ladder Brewing Company;Easily one of the most watery browns I’ve ever had. It pours decent and has an ok aroma of chocolate malt but the flavor just isn’t cutting it. There are some very subtle roasty notes up front but it finishes very bland. Just too plain to even be a decent brown. Quite disappointing!
Hook and Ladder Backdraft Brown Ale;Silver Spring, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Hook and Ladder Brewing Company;From notes. 12oz bottle poured into a shaker. Aroma of banana and roasty malt. Not a whole lot going on here. Drinkable but don’t seek it out.
Hook and Ladder Backdraft Brown Ale;Silver Spring, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Hook and Ladder Brewing Company;Brown, as you might expect. Splotchy white head. Smells like brown sugar and a bit of coffee. Flavor is brown sugar on toast. Dryish finish.
Hook and Ladder Backdraft Brown Ale;Silver Spring, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Hook and Ladder Brewing Company;Roasted peanuts, sweet and salty aroma. Flavors of caramel, toasted bread, cherries and a hint of vanilla. Wet paper and watery finish. Plays it safe and doesnt really grab an interest.
Hook and Ladder Backdraft Brown Ale;Silver Spring, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Hook and Ladder Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. Served in a pint glass. Color is a moderately-dark brown with a tan head that persists for a bit before falling. Nose is quite plain with a bit of caramel and bread. The taste is bready with some light sweetness. Decent body with normal carbonation levels. Really just don’t have too much to say about this one. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 11-14-2010
Hook and Ladder Backdraft Brown Ale;Silver Spring, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Hook and Ladder Brewing Company;Too watery for the style, a slightly malty and pretty watery flavor does not do this style justice, there are way too many other examples in this style that do that.
Hook and Ladder Backdraft Brown Ale;Silver Spring, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Hook and Ladder Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Poured brown with a small head. Aroma was nice: malt, sweet, maybe some mild fruit. Taste really falls short: water, muddled malts, faint nut. Thinnish body. No real depth there. Overall: the nose was nice but the taste was very detached and lost.
Hook and Ladder Backdraft Brown Ale;Silver Spring, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;Hook and Ladder Brewing Company;Brown w/ off-white head. Big sweet malt and toffee aroma. Taste: Some toasty malt, caramel, chocolate and a little nutty. Not as sweet as the aroma hints at. Smooth and drinkable. Very nice brown.
SLO Extra Pale Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;SLO Brew;From old tasting notes. Hazy orange gold color. Thick creamy beige head. Earthy malt aroma. Creamy fruit malt flavor. Nicely balanced hop finish.
SLO Extra Pale Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;SLO Brew;Golden orange pour with a white head. Nose is on the sweet side for a pale ale. Bread and grain aromas, some perfume, floral hops, grass, and light citrus peel. Flavor is a bit grassy, light bitterness, and sweet grain and malt. Some bread, water, floral hops, and very mild citrus peel. Pretty pedestrian pale ale.
SLO Extra Pale Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;SLO Brew;This a decent but not an outstanding pale ale. Very light in color it just doesn’t have all that much hops. A very easy finish. Certainly could be a bit happier.
SLO Extra Pale Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;SLO Brew;Draught at the brwepub. Clear golden, no head. Sweaty citrus aroma. Mid sweet with clean mouthfeel and medium body. The harsh malt hardness is covered up to some extent by gooseberrry and citrus. Resiny bitter finish. A mediocre beer with lovely hop polish.
SLO Extra Pale Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;SLO Brew;Bottle courtesy of cakanator. Pours a cloudy amber with a minimal off-white head. The nose is malt and light citrus. The taste is malt, lemon peel and light earthy hops in the finish. This one has some age on it as well I suspect. Light-to-medium bodied. Not very good.
SLO Extra Pale Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;SLO Brew;12oz bottle-pours a thin off white head and gold color with floaties in the bottle that become lots of very small floaties after poured.

SLO Extra Pale Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;SLO Brew;Had this beer on 3/31/1998. Color is a bright golden with a slight haze in it. Carbonation is very good with a nice head. Aroma is a lightly sweet malt scent. Taste is a light body beer with a good bitter finish. It starts off with a light crisp body that goes down cool. The finish is fair, it’s a bitterness that gently builds with a slight tone of sweet malt. It’s main down fall is there is no hop flavor and there is a touch of skunk in it, but its very faint
SLO Extra Pale Ale;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;SLO Brew;I poured this beer ice cold just to try the first one, not to rate it and it poured w/ an awesome head and good lacing w/decent color for the style. But thats where the positive aspects of this beer end. palate was like iron, texture was as weak as a bud light! the head disa peared in seconds, very little-no scratch that it did have an aroma but not consistant again w/ the style. Wont buy again!

Wild Onion Jack Stout;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wild Onion Brewery;"Aroma - chocolate, roast, and even some smoke. Appearance - the body is black.

Palate - medium body, creamy texture, average carbonation, and a slight bit of roast."
Wild Onion Jack Stout;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wild Onion Brewery;Can. Nose is sweet, chocolate and roast, very light fruit. Pours pitch with a fluffy and sudsy tan head. Watery light body sweet and strongly fruity with no roast or chocolate, but there is a thin layer of brownish malt there, and some alcohol showing (too much for this sizer, really). Relatively soft (carbonation burned itself out quickly) with some nice black roast, but missing the middle roast textures and basically any coffee or chocolate in the mouth. No offensive by any means, just a soon-forgotten 90’s brewpub revival. [2015.12.25: 2.7]

Aroma is pretty good, notes of darker chocolate, oaats, dark toast, soy sauce, black olives and a touch of coffee. Medium body, super soft carbonation that is almost nonexisistant and a quicker fading aftertaste. Flavor is not as good as the aroma, notes of bitter dark chocolate, dark toast, cola, chocolate syrup and some soy sauce. Not bad but nothing to seek out.

Blue Ridge (MD) Amber Lager;Easton, Maryland, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Amber pour with odd fruity aroma. I think something was wrong with this...it reminded of the Penn Weizen I had a ways back. Sour, citrus like bitter lemon mixed with sugar. Overcarbonated and thin. I couldn’t finish it. I even let it warm way up...no improvement. Yuck.
Blue Ridge (MD) Amber Lager;Easton, Maryland, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Not a bad vienna, though my hometown Penn Pilsner has this beat. Aroma was very weak which is disappointing as it would have scored higher. Pour was a nice medium amber with no head. Taste was a little thick...but had heavy roasted and caramel malt flavor. Nice carbonation and a a thin film seems to go down the throat with the swallow. Odd. Decent beer.

Crooked River Expansion Draft Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Massey and I bought this beer 13 or 14 years ago at Shopper’s Paradise on mega-clearance because we were having a party. The Browns had long since returned to disgrace the gridiron. Don’t remember much about the beer, but we found some sweet-ass shirts in the closet the next day and watched the Masters. Tiger Woods probably won and probably celebrated with a limo full of Perkins waitresses. Notes of value and irresponsibility. Mouthfeel like a bastard.
Crooked River Expansion Draft Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);I can’t believe this was in my friends fridge since ’99, we had to drink this hardcore Cleveland Browns fans beer. Golden pour, still a slight head. Taste like any other crappy pale lager, slight malts with corn and all that other crap mixed in and with a semi sweet probably oxidized taste, and no hops. After 7 years and being in a fridge this beer held up, I just wish it were a good beer to begin with.
Crooked River Expansion Draft Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Nice golden colored beer with good head. Nice malty aroma. Full malty taste. very good finish. Full Mouthfeel.

Crooked River Expansion Draft Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);"A gift for me from my dad in '99. Tasted like the ""Baqllpark Brew"" Crooked River used to make for Jacob's field, only had a salty taste, why? Because I was crying tears of joy when I drank it. Not a remarkable brew, but the label is proudly on my wall."
Crooked River Expansion Draft Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Very enjoyable light golden ale with no adjuncts at all. This all malt brew is full of flavor and is still light enough to share with your less experienced beer drinking friends. Very enjoyable beer.
Crooked River Expansion Draft Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);Fair malts and hops, clean golden color that pours to a bright white head. Clean and crisp, kept one bottle for a collectors item.

Thomas Creek Dockside Pilsner;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thomas Creek Brewery;5/2/17. 12oz bottle from Five Points. Golden pour with a small white head. Plain bready aroma, pizza dough, a whiff of grass. Bready flavor, sweet pizza dough... maybe a slight bite of citrus if I really search, but really just doughy maltiness. Eh.
Thomas Creek Dockside Pilsner;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thomas Creek Brewery;Bottle. Very light yellow, crystal clear and fizzy. Sweet, bready aroma. Drinks with a very starchy character, corn and even a hint of salt. Very reminiscent of some European patio beers I enjoyed back in the day. For the lighter beer lovers. (#6479, 12/27/2016)
Thomas Creek Dockside Pilsner;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thomas Creek Brewery;Draft. Crystal clear golden color, medium white head. Straw aroma. Taste is lightly peppery straw.
Thomas Creek Dockside Pilsner;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thomas Creek Brewery;Pours a clear golden with a fat, white head. Green grape and green banana peel nose. Most of the flavors approximate the nose, only in a more prominent fashion. A bit of a spicy Belgian note toward the finish.
Thomas Creek Dockside Pilsner;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thomas Creek Brewery;Not Thomas Creek’s most exemplary brew, a rather basic pilsner with a light bready malt flavor, hint of noble hops with a grassy-lemon finish. Appearance was a fresh yellow golden color with pleasant lacing and some light white head, aroma of the same flavors described above. Light-bodied, just a good mild example of the style!
Thomas Creek Dockside Pilsner;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thomas Creek Brewery;Sample at Örebro Öl & Whisky 2015. Malty smell with pale bread. Similar taste. Crisp. Light bitterness. Clean.

Thomas Creek Dockside Pilsner;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thomas Creek Brewery;Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. Aroma- Has a soft aroma with grass and malt the primary driver. Appearance- A pale clear yellow color with a very small white head Taste- Has a very slight flavor, not bad but lacks character Palate- A light bodied medium carbonated pilsner Overall- Not a bad beer to drink when needing to be refreshed, very much in line with a BMC brand to me.
Thomas Creek Dockside Pilsner;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thomas Creek Brewery;12 Fl. Oz. Bottle. Poured hazy, golden, some white head and a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma of grain and malts combined with some hints of hops.

Thomas Creek Appalachian Amber Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Creek Brewery;Draft. Amber color poured with a thin white head. The aroma is malty caramel with a light hoppy earthiness to it. It is a little thick on the tongue. Good.
Thomas Creek Appalachian Amber Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Creek Brewery;Amber ale is one of my favorite beer styles. Malty and nutty aroma with deep copper color. This beer has a heavier body, malty with moderate hops and crispness, with a little sweetness and nutty flavor to finish. I don't like it as much as their Red Ale offering (which has a lighter body).
Thomas Creek Appalachian Amber Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Creek Brewery;Have enjoyed this fresh on tap in downtown Greenville and also from the bottle at home in Columbia, and from both sources this is an exceptionally full-bodied and flavorful classic amber ale. Pours a transparent but dark mahogany wood color with a healthy amount of foam and an aroma of unsweet caramel. Rich toffee and caramel in the flavor but with less sugary sweetness, not much hoppy contrast. Takes a more malt-centric approach to this style and tends toward the burnt end of the caramelization spectrum. Personally, I prefer the less overt sweetness of this flavor profile much more than Thomas Creek's River Falls Red Ale, which I used to get this beer confused with.
Thomas Creek Appalachian Amber Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Creek Brewery;Pours a clear dark amber with light head. Has a strong caramel malt aroma.

Thomas Creek Appalachian Amber Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Creek Brewery;Old rating. Decidedly average and boring amber with all that entails…color, malty body, some sweetness, medium body.

Thomas Creek Appalachian Amber Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Creek Brewery;12oz bottle, purchased on 2/23/15 from Habersham in Savannah. Shared with tmoney99. Bottle is labeled 6.8%. Mostly clear amber-brown color, with some dark particles in the body. Little ring of bubbly off-white head, few bits of lace. Toasty malt, and some caramel. Touch of dark fruit. Mildly spicy and earthy. Moderate bitter, light to moderate sweet. Medium to bigger body. Lighter, slightly rough carbonation. Mild slick finish. Surprisingly, one of the better Thomas Creek beers I picked up (I was beginning to get more and more nervous every time I popped a bottle open). Good bigger bitterness on this, good bigger flavor. A solid, darker, earthier hoppier amber ale.
Thomas Creek Appalachian Amber Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Creek Brewery;Tap takeover at Matthews Beer Temple. Very average amber ale. Well balanced but not memorable at all. Pass.
Wisconsin Whitetail Cream Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;"Bottle; Pour is murky gold with a modest white head in this glass ; some spotty lacing here.

Wisconsin Whitetail Cream Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;a light clear peach with a bright white head, nice ring, but that’s about it... the aroma is very sweet, generic cream and sugar, a hint of skunk and alcohol... the taste is chemical alcohol and a hint of stall chalk... skip this mess.

Wisconsin Whitetail Cream Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Hazy orange body with a thin white head. The aroma is light but pleasant. Mild citrus, nuts, and bread. The palate is a bit thin with some chalky residue...interesting. Completely unoffensive flavor. Overall pretty sweet...sweet citrus and malt. There’s really no hop balance. Not a bad brew. Reminds me a bit of Spotted Cow, just not quite as satisfying.
Wisconsin Whitetail Cream Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;I am always skeptical of anything that claims to be Irish and is not either from Ireland or a stout. These beers are typically bland amber-colored lagers and ales and not much worth trying. This is actually not a bland amber-colored brew though in so far as it’s actually golden in color. Aside from that, it does nothing to quell my skepticism. It is cloudy w/ a small white head. Nose is grainy and lightly fruity and possibly a bit nutty. Lightly sweet with earthy bitterness. Comes off as almost flat but there are still a few prickles of carbonation. There is nothing foul or off about this beer but there is nothing really to like about it either. It is neither particularly flavorful nor particularly drinkable.
Wisconsin Whitetail Cream Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to 17thfloor.

Lang Creek Tri-Motor Amber Ale;Marion, Montana, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;This beer pours an amberish red color with a frothy slightly off white head with good lacing. From aesthetics alone I was pretty damn pleased with this beer. The aroma is pretty prominent for something i had low hopes for. Caramel and hops are in there with a chocolate or molasses undertone.

Lang Creek Skydiver Blonde Ale;Marion, Montana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Bottle. Poured with a very spare, white head that was greatly diminishing. Body was slightly hazy and a dark yellow color. Aroma was of light malt and some breadiness. Light to medium-bodied on the palate, mostly thin-textured, with average carbonation. Flavor was lightly sweet with a short duration... went down very easy, but didn’t taste like anything special. A very easy blonde to drink... maybe too easy.

Maritime Pacific Islander Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Maritime Pacific Brewing Co.;20 z. at Columbia City Ale House. This is a fairly clear amber with a tall head. It seems more like a British pale ale to me with some stonefruity yeast character, but maybe that's just the hop choice. It's certainly malty enough to be English style. Lots of biscuit is present with a firm hop bitterness. The finish is kind of toffee sweet to balance.

Maritime Pacific Islander Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Maritime Pacific Brewing Co.;Draught at Emmett Watson’s, 11/4/15. Good clarity throughout this copper-brass colored beer, with ample carbonation creating a medium-sized white head that shows moderate retention. Soft, but quite fragrant hops in the nose add a dusty, lightly dried floral aroma with just a hint of lemon. Bits of caramel and honey play about but it never seems biscuity or toasty, which is nice (I think). No alcohol, nor flaw. Moderate carbonation and a soft, lightly malty texture go down very easily in this hoppy, but not overly bitter pale ale. Floral notes, vanilla, light baked bread and a lightly dextrinous chewiness to the texture, on the finish. Very reserved, and while it’s brewed admirably, I can’t help wanting just a little more brightness and punch to it. The delicate flavors seem to fade in to the more domineering malts while a lightly piney note appears on the finish, rather out-of-place for the rest of the beer.
Maritime Pacific Islander Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Maritime Pacific Brewing Co.;On tap at Maritime Pacific, pours a hazy golden with a small white head.

Dick's Silk Lady;Centralia, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dick's Brewing Company;Bottle with Carla. Pours lightly hazy gold with white foam. Smells sweet with hints of belgian yeast. Tastes lightly wheaty and strongly of authentic Belgian yeasts.
Dick's Silk Lady;Centralia, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Dick's Brewing Company;Pours a light orange into Delirium Tremens Tulip. Three fingers of white head.. Light, crisp smell. Light fruits. Not a true Belgium smell. Maybe a bit bland. Sweet taste, but not much of it. Really light bodied. If you want a cheap Belgium knock off, this isn’t that close. Nothing special.
Dick's Imperial Stout;Centralia, Washington, United States;Stout - Imperial;Dick's Brewing Company;Pours a very dark ruby-brown, almost black, with a medium size tan head.

Dick's Imperial Stout;Centralia, Washington, United States;Stout - Imperial;Dick's Brewing Company;What a great beer!! Wonderful body and roasted malt character!!! Finish is smooth.
Dick's Imperial Stout;Centralia, Washington, United States;Stout - Imperial;Dick's Brewing Company;"Nice deep dark brownish coloured body with a large, fast-dying light brown coloured head with larger bubbles and a glow of cola colours when held up to a light. Aroma of alcohol, raisins, pit fruits, chocolate, yeast and a bit of prunes - strong, but more of a porter or sweet stout than of an imperial stout. Medium-bodied; Strong alcohol and vanilla flavours with hints of oak and coffee, but a lot of earthy and mushroomy flavours with touches of chocolate and prunes. Aftertaste is fairly one dimensional and not too pungent - malty and chocolate flavours come out the strongest with a touch of alcohol on the finish. Overall, a decent baltic porter or stout, but not cutting it for the style. That said, it’s still a drinkable beer - just don’t expect it to be quite the imperial stout that you imagine, especially at 7,5% abv. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Belmont Station in Portland, Oregon on 12-April-2013 for US$2,59 sampled at home in Washington on 01-November-2014, about a year and half after purchasing it, which perhaps mellowed it out a bit, but this one wasn’t strong anyways."
Dick's Imperial Stout;Centralia, Washington, United States;Stout - Imperial;Dick's Brewing Company;Rating from my backlog. The look is reddish brown in color with a tan head. The smell is roast, malts, coffee, chocolate. The taste is chocolate, coffee, cat food, and ok.

Pours black with a mocha colored head. Roast, chocolate, coffee, fruit, balancing bitterness great mouthfeel @7.5% which seems pretty low for an imperial stout, but doesn’t lack in flavor

In mouth, very sweet chocolate with vinous notes, ashes, floral hops, treacle, veering into old ale territory.

Saxer Dark Lager;Portland, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);No. 500!! When poured into my glass, this beer had a small sized tan head that contained fine-large bubbles that was mostly lasting. The body of this beer was clear with carbonation observed and a reddish-brown hue. The nose was malty and fruity with a malt and caramel flavoring. The palate was smooth and medium bodied. This beer left a good amount of lacing on the sides of my glass.
Saxer Dark Lager;Portland, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"This brew poured a small head of fine to medium sized light brown colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a poor lacing and a softly carbonated transparent brown colored body. The aroma is a very nice caramel malt one and the mouthfeel is smooth with a touch of ""Brown"" feeling to it. The flavor is a medium strength roasted caramel malt one with a mild caramel overtone to it. It is a bit on the thin side and could use a bit more character to it, but still i liked it and would drink it again."
Saxer Dark Lager;Portland, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Clear amber brown with a thin light brown head and large bubbles. Malty nose with a nutty, raisen aroma. Flavor is of caramel, sopa pop, and sugar. This has an even nutty taste, though a bit thin.
Saxer Dark Lager;Portland, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Dark amber with a short-lived head. Low carbonation. Slight nuttiness in the aroma. Smooth and malty with some roasted and grainy malt flavors. Slightly grassy hop flavors contribute a little in the finish; hardly any bitterness. Slight sourness in the aftertaste. Not bad, but it doesn''t seem to have a lot of personality."

Blue Ridge (MD) ESB Red Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);"A pretty good hometown beer, I sampled poured from the bottle. The color was a dark orange-reddish with a thin tan head. The beer tastes pretty bitter with a slight touch of malty sweetness; it is also mildly sour.The aroma is dominantly malty with a possible hint of fruityness. It had fizzy carbonation and a medium body with a slick texture. The most inventive and rewarding of the Blue Ridge beers I have sampled so far."
Blue Ridge (MD) ESB Red Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);A pretty good ESB - I just had a keg of Stoudt’s Scarlet Lady ESB in my beer meister and I actually wish I had had this one instead. It has a nice reddish color and very good flavor. I don’t think ESB is one of my favorite styles anymore, but this one was rather drinkable, all the same.
Blue Ridge (MD) ESB Red Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);From a 12 oz. long neck brown bottle with a short blurb on the left side of label and a unmarked best before date on the right side. Made a satisfactory appearance, poured an amber hued copper with a foamy, clingy white head that settled into a thin bubbly lacing, good carbonation. Had a piney, earthy, lemony grassy nose with a sweet grainy malt background. A smoothly bitter, crisp light bodied mouth feel, good drinkability. Tobacco and earthy grassiness with a touch of lemon, a gentle rolling hop bitterness, balanced by a sweet, toasted barley maltiness with a light butteriness creeping in and a sweet malty and tobacco grassy finish, very tasty. A decent ESB from Blue Ridge, a tad too light bodied for me, but very quaffable.

Kaliber;Dublin, Ireland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Vegetal, sweet, bloody awful. I tried this on tap years ago and it is as bad as people say. It's also over carbonated.
Kaliber;Dublin, Ireland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Pours dark amber into a shaker. White head with little retention recedes to hug rim. Sweet malt aromas. Medium bodied with rotting vegetables and sweet malt extract upfront turning to rancid earth in the lasting finish.
Kaliber;Dublin, Ireland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Low alcohol lager. Can from local corner shop. Good appearance and a sweet malty taste, dominated by a cloying artificial taste. Some bitterness, but not enough to offset the rather metallic sweetness. Not great, but better than nothing if you are trying to avoid alcohol.
Kaliber;Dublin, Ireland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Bottle - poura gold with a white head. Aroma is sweet malt. Taate is sweet and metallic.
Kaliber;Dublin, Ireland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Terrible low alcohol beer. Overly malty sweet, gold and thin. Tried for the first time in 2009.
Kaliber;Dublin, Ireland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Bottle pours a clear golden copper with a one finger off-white head and light lacing. Aroma is molasses, bread, wet suede, and light raisin. Taste is primarily bread crust while the backing flavors promote sweetness. The aftertaste is molasses and is short lived.
Kaliber;Dublin, Ireland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Bottle from Merchants, oh boy. Aroma is bad, like sticks in a forest, caramel, figs maybe, it smells like a wet log with moss on it after a good rain, grains, just awful. Appearance is amber, clear, light tan head that is amazingly still around. Taste is just terrible, caramel, corn, water, fizz, fake sweetener rounding out with an astoundingly bitter hop presence. Mouthfeel is light body, it feels overly sweetened, light crisp carbonation, really dreadful fake sweet caramel corn water aftertaste. Overall, we do have a contender here for worst beer I have ever had. Even the other n/a offerings had something to offer, but this one is extremely off-putting.
Kaliber;Dublin, Ireland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. James's Gate (Diageo);my mother used to buy me this all the time when i was a kid, even though she probably shouldn't have! either way, i thought i was the bees knees, and i honestly recall enjoying the taste. anyway, i stumbled upon a bottle recently and couldn't finish it. down the sink it went. definitely avoid.
Kaliber;Dublin, Ireland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Aroma, appearance, and body weren’t bad, flavor had a sour aspect. Tried a second bottle, same thing.
Kaliber;Dublin, Ireland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;St. James's Gate (Diageo);"It pours a nice deep gold colour and brings close to a 1 finger head of foam. The lacing is good; actually better than many a brew I’ve had before. The smell is all cereal grain. Corn Flakes, Post Toasties...I almost want to reach for some milk and a bowl. The taste follows the nose to a tee, maybe a slightly better perception to my palate than to my nose. Cereal grain with slight sweetness, no bitterness. Not at all surprising, considering the style, and not offensive in any way to my palate and, in fact, has a kind of appeal that is hard to explain. Hey, we are working here with the bare minimum in alcohol content. ’nuff said. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkability? I bought a sixer and this bottle sure left the scene in a hurry. I’m not saying that I’d want to drink it every day but it does make for a good change of pace. I think this is a very good Malt beverage."

Medium bodied, well balanced.
New England Gold Stock Ale;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;IPA;New England Brewing Co.;Nebco crushing it per usual. Really nice noble hopped spicy ipa with floral, and grassy herbal hoppiness with a nice toasty and nutty malt background. Not your traditional IPA at all and thats why it rocks.

New England Gold Stock Ale;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;IPA;New England Brewing Co.;"64 oz growler into a tulip. Pours a hazy golden amber with thick sudsy white foam that clings forever. Looks like most hoppy NEBCO offerings. Nose is really unique and amazing. That typical English hop quality of grass, earth, and floral notes. Beyond that is a huge sweetness of caramel that ends in an almost zesty way, like a lemon or lime. Faint oak and vanilla to round it out. Really great. The flavor doesn’t quite match up though. English hops; floral and grassy with a moderate bitterness. Caramel malts and some wood on the finish, Smooth and easy drinking. Medium bodied and creamy. A pretty unique offering that I wish wasn’t so rare. However it’s not NEBCO’s best."

New England Gold Stock Ale;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;IPA;New England Brewing Co.;Growler in a tulip. Pours cloudy golden with a lacy, off-white head. Aroma of a lot of floral hops, some pale and caramel hops, and some dough. Flavor the same, with a lot of hops for the hops used. Average texture. A good IPA.
New England Gold Stock Ale;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;IPA;New England Brewing Co.;Big thanks to woosterbill for this one. Reviewed from notes. Pours a nice, deep golden color with a good white head. Nose brings some really strong earthy, herbal, and lightly-citric hops. Really, really nice. Taste is along the same lines with a bit of earthy and floral characteristics plus a good deal of pine and some slight citrus. This is a cacophony of hops without any one type really dominating. Slight bready notes. Great bitterness levels and a bit dry. I was not at all impressed with Sea Hag, but this showed me that when they try, NEBC can really bring the hop attack. Serving type: growler Reviewed on: 10-29-2010

Aroma is moderate, with a bit of yeasty sourness, not very pleasant. Later also some buttery aroma, maybe diacetyl. Body is typical Czech bittersweet, with slightly closer to the sweet end than what I would prefer and expect from a pilsner. Nevertheless, there is nice, spicy, floral bitterness. Palate is perfect, mild, silky carbonation and a very fresh character. Enjoyable, fresh and harmonic, with minor flaws.

Mahrs Bräu Kellerbier Ungespundet Hefetrüb;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Mahrs Bräu;4 finger off-white head. Bit of lacing. Semi-hazy, mid amber to murky orange coloured beer. Aroma of wet sourdough bread, citrus peels, grains, hints of sweet liquorice and raisins. Taste of grains, bit metallic, bit of corn sweetness and a general pilsner skunkiness. Mouthfeel is soft with a round body. Medium, long & skunky bitterness. Medium carbonation. Light, somewhat hollow feel. Oily after a while. Overall: Well this was a dissappointing. Expected a dope ass Märzen or something along those lines but it didn't differ that much from a run-of-the-mill lager. It didn't have the typical overcarbonated, watery type of feel so there's atleast that.

Boulder Beer Fall Fest Autumn Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;The aroma has caramel malt and pine hops with some spice and fruit. The appearance is deep amber with a small head. The flavor is not the best. There are all the elements from the aroma plus some prunes, paper, and grass. The palate is typical for an amber ale but the aftertaste is acidic. Much like the last Boulder Beer I had, this one could be stale.
Boulder Beer Fall Fest Autumn Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;Pours dark golden tending towards amber with a fully receding white head.

Boulder Beer Fall Fest Autumn Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;Deep amber. Nose some piney hops, bit of caramel.

Boulder Beer Fall Fest Autumn Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;Bottle (12oz). Poured slightly cloudy umber with a small off-white diminishing head. Aroma is of sharp evergreen resiny hops, but not rich or full - there’s also a background of light roast caramel/cocoa malt and pine cones - really does put you in mind of a walk in a late fall northern forest, although it gets a little funky on warming. Taste is much milder, the hops are muted and the malt is pretty basic, not much roast or caramel character - mouthfeel is weak and mostly flat, a touch astringent. The aroma’s the best thing about this, and even that’s not memorable.
Boulder Beer Fall Fest Autumn Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;[bottle - 12 oz] Slightly murky ruby pour with a soapy looking white head. Not much of it, but very nice color. Very light aroma, mostly caramel or toffee mixed with some apple cider aroma, cinnamon and grain. Apples begin the flavor with a malty and grainy middle and a dry and very flavorless finish. It claims dry hopped, but there weren’t many hops to be found. Some slight bitterness at the end of a few sips though.

Boulder Beer Singletrack Copper Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;"This was a rather interesting beer. Reminded me of a lighter version of Lagunitas Censored Ale versus many of the ""ambers"" out there....or similar to some Scottish Ales. This was actually more of a darker cloudy brown/copper color that looked pretty much like apple cider. Flavors were mostly caramel malts but had some citrusy flavors similar a pale ale or IPA. Not as bitter as those, but had a decent hop tone at the end. Nothing really special here, but is a decent beer either way."

Color is a very light gold with good carbonation and light head. Aroma is very thin and light. Taste is like a sour Bud. It starts with a light body that goes down crisp.

Boulder Beer Pass Time Pale Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Boulder Beer Company;The English Pale Ale is not often attempted in the States so kudos to them for giving it a shot. Its a tough thing to brew so lightly and all of the imperfections shine through. The hops don’t dominate in favor of sweet, bready malts. There is a little lemon zing, but its barely discernible.

Boulder Beer Pass Time Pale Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Boulder Beer Company;Re-rating and upping the score. The hops profile in this is not the most pleasant - a little sour - but downing the rest of the six pack with various meals during the week (especially Sunday breakfast) helped me better appreciate the taste. Pour from a 12 oz bottle. Medium amber brew with thin white head. Aroma of sweet malts. Taste is just off the mark - very honey-like sweet at the start breaking into a nice hops bitterness that holds promise but descends into a sour grassey mess at the finish. that final sour hops slug is really rather unpleasant. Nice palate. Distinctive but I’ll pass on this in the future.
Boulder Beer Pass Time Pale Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Boulder Beer Company;Color of honey, aroma of cardboard.

Boulder Beer Pass Time Pale Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Boulder Beer Company;12 ounce bottle. Pours a bright burnt orange. Head is minimal and unremarkable. Sweet nose of caramel malt and some hops. Sweet toffee taste with minimal bitterness in the finish. Grassy and earthy hops come through the more you drink the beer, but it’s the malts that are the real star. If it had more hops going on, this thing could be astronomical. As it is, it’s simply quite good. That’s not a bad thing.
Boulder Beer Pass Time Pale Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - English;Boulder Beer Company;On tap @ brewery. Smelled like a copper penny. Pretty mild body with a bland and unimaginative taste. Crisp and dry finish, so its easy to drink but not very tasty.

San Miguel Dark Lager;Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Dark Lager - Premium;San Miguel;330ml bottle from Coco Supermarket, Seminyak, Bali (Rp 29,000): Dark brown to ruby red in colour with a bubbly, tan coloured head that sits about a centimetre tall before halving in size. Roasted malts & darker notes open the nose with sugars & caramel showing before a nutty aroma sees things out. Similarly the taste is dark with the same roasted malts & toasted flavours the nose hinted at, I got more of a nutty flavour here too with & earthy bitterness near the end. It's smooth & medium bodied beer with a semi-sweet, crisp & wet feel to it & the balance was better than expected too. This one was easy to drink, enjoyable & one of the better San Miguel beers I've had into the bargain.

San Miguel Dark Lager;Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Dark Lager - Premium;San Miguel;330 ml. bottle. Pours a medium thick, well retained beige head, without lacing, over a clear brown (SRM 20) body........nose is lightly roasted malts, with mild cocoa, slight caramel tones, no esters, no hops......taste is mildly sweet with caramel tones, light roasted malts with mild hints of cocoa, toasted bread, finishes dry with no ester or hop tones......mouth feel, light body, no alcohol, moderate carbonation. This is clean and more or less meets the general style of Dark Lagers, but is not particularly interesting because of simplicity. However it is drinkable. BJCP 7/2/11/4/6

San Miguel Dark Lager;Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Dark Lager - Premium;San Miguel;"Purchased at AAFES Class 6 at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, VA 11.2 oz bottle. Really a big letdown. Watery and weak at the start; picked up a bit later but not enough oomph for me. Nose is sweet malty but too sweet for me. No trace of ANY hops to my nose or taste but they have to be in there somewhere. Definitely not sessionable. No date markings; how it got from Manila through Skaggs (US importer) and into AAFES and onto shelf in VA likely not efficient, effective or economical."
San Miguel Dark Lager;Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Dark Lager - Premium;San Miguel;Pours dark amber with heavy head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is caramel exclusively. Taste is sweet toffee, moving to a light coffee flavor with a hint of cinnamon. Finish is smooth, but without note. Not as bad as I was expecting. A decent lager, if you are drinking a lot of them.

Oranjeboom Premier Lager (3.5%);Breda, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Dutch Breweries;Very mild smell, light gold color, medium white head. Initial flavor is light malt, grain, slight peppery spice. Medium carbonation, very refreshing. I really enjoy Euro-pale lagers for some reason, this is my current fav. It's similar to Heineken but more interesting to me at least.

4-Temps Corne de Brume;Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Brasserie aux 4-Temps / Mary Anne;Bottle. Pours a deep brune body with a tan head with great retention. Peat y dry and wooden toned body with a mild sweetness. A mild mineral tone with peat dryness and a moderate warming.

Great stuff honestly, for me to rate a scotch ale a 4, now thats a killer scotch ale.
Unibroue Kamouraska;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Unibroue (Sapporo);Bottle [341ml] shared with HogTownHarry, GregClow & garthicus -- c/o HogTownHarry. Yeah, this sucker is old but I ain’t passing up rating it. Pours a clear pale gold with a spare diminishing white head. Poured more in the glass and now it’s a cloudy copper. Aroma of maple syrup, sugary malt, fruit and yeast. Slightly watery, light flavour of fruit, yeast and maple syrup -- somewhat oily mouthfeel. Average bodied. Another very old Unibroue beer that has held up quite well.
Unibroue Kamouraska;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Unibroue (Sapporo);341ml bottle - shared with blankboy, garthicus and gregclow, via trade with JulienHuxley. Clear light gold with a smallish creamy-fizzy white head, some bubbles. Like the Sans Nom (both senior citizen bottles sample at the same time), it smells dry, fruity and a bit papery - not much alcohol presence in it, perhaps a tad herbal. There’s not much taste left at all - vague fruit sweetness, but mostly just dry, almost chalky oxidized grain - not nasty, but not all that pleasant either - mostly nothing. Light body, weak carbonation, slightly syrupy, and the papery dryness shifts to a mustiness in the finish - yeah, obviously way past its prime (but again, not vomit-inducing, not really even a drainpour). Thanks, Julien!!
Unibroue Kamouraska;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Unibroue (Sapporo);Thanks to HogTownHarry. Appearance: cloudy yellow, a tiny white head. Aroma: perfume, caramel, honey and maple syrup. There’s a little spice and fruit hiding in there too. Flavour: light body with a little diluted honey, maple syrup, musky with a little sawdust.
Unibroue Kamouraska;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Unibroue (Sapporo);Tart green apples and mild horsblanket nose . Mild balsamic and sourdough breead flavors. Orange and lemon zest soice with mild cloves and allspice. Nice yeasty mouthfeel. Tart acidic finish with some odd spice notes.
Unibroue Kamouraska;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Unibroue (Sapporo);Wow. This was one beer that I have been wanting to try for quite sometime. Huge thanks to Todd for opening this one at Celebration November 2004. Light gold in colour. Aroma of cider, slightly sour, some light malt and some yeast. Flavour was pretty light with some cider vinegar, slightly sweet malt (cookie dough), still some citrus hops (lemon, orange). Still had medium carbonation after all these years, full mouthfeel. Finishes quick. Quit nice still, thanks again Todd.
Unibroue Kamouraska;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Unibroue (Sapporo);Wow, I can’t believe I’m getting to rate this one. Cheers to Todd for starting the night off with this rarity - shared with muzzlehatch, tiggmtl, Rastacouere, radiomgb, DumDum and our host CapFlu. Bottle was found hiding on a shelf and was 1999 ’vintage.’ Somewhat cloudy pale straw yellow with a thin head that left us quickly and for good. Slightly sour cider aromas hit you immediately and then there is some cookie-dough and dry yeastiness too. An oily mouth-coating honey/fruit flavour - some citrus and some pear - leads to a quick finish. Stood up fairly well considering, but a treat no matter the outcome.
Unibroue Kamouraska;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Unibroue (Sapporo);1999 bottle, shared with CapFlu, tiggmtl, Rastacouere, Beerhugger, Radiomgb, and DumDum in Ottawa. Hazy honey-dry apple cider color...bit cidery, and sour on the nose, lightly malty and yeasty flavor, with honey and a bit of pear, quite sweet. Full, slightly liquorish/oily mouthfeel. Amazingly good for its age...thanks again Todd!
Unibroue Kamouraska;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Unibroue (Sapporo);Thanks Todd for sharing... Cidery, yeasty, dry, powdery, cookie-dough aroma that is slightly sour. Hazy,golden straw coloured body with thin, white, fully diminishing head. Yeasty cookie-dough, orange-lemon-citrus flavour. Mouthfeel is a touch oily. Medium bodied and very low carbonation. Though obviously past its prime, this was still a treat to have sampled. Bottle enjoyed with beerhugger, CapFlu, DumDum, muzzlehatch, radiomgb and Rastacouere.
Unibroue Kamouraska;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Unibroue (Sapporo);12oz: Clear yellowish cider appearance, no head despite a surprising pop upon opening. Weird aroma, this old Unibroue yeast seemed to impart very cookie-ish overtones. It smells quite tart, dry, powdery with curacao suggestions. Past its prime ginger cookies flavour with notes of pears, coconut, repellently short finish, staling. Tart cookie dough finish. Medium bodied, very low carbonation. Yeah this was past its prime, but don’t pass the chance if you manage to find one, the difference between the older and newyer unibroue strain is worth an essay (which I don’t volunteer to write). Thanks Todd!
Unibroue Kamouraska;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Unibroue (Sapporo);(Bottle) Sampled at Celebration November 2004. Pours a small white head with a golden body. The nose is somewhat musky, horseblanket with a milf flat apple sauce to it. The flavour lacks the renowned Unibroue yeastiness but it had pleasant hoppy notes. Amazing that there is this much left in the way of aroma and flavour after 5 years. Past its prime but still holding in there... Overall very nice.
Sarah Hughes Dark Ruby Mild;Dudley, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Sarah Hughes Brewery;Cask at Great Western, Wolverhampton I can’t believe I’ve not rated this before ! Nose is unremarkable – just some hints of porridge. Pours a rich ruby brown with a small cream head, and good lacing. Taste is a bittersweet conglomerate that is hard to define. More and more flavours come to the fore as it progresses through the mouth. Hazelnuts, liquorice, blackcurrant, raisins, figs, all with a full-bodied malty base to them. A wonderfully complex beer – the classic strong mild that all others (ought to) seek to emulate. It doesn’t get much better than this.

Wychwood Fiddlers Elbow (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);From Mar 2006 Poured from 500ml brown bottle(room temp) a a medium gold with a large head of foam that dissipated slowly. The smell is a sweet and spicy mix of hops and malt that's not subtle at all and that is a good thing. The taste repeats the smell. Yummy sweet malty goodness up front with an ample background of lemony hops gives this ale such great balance and drinkablility that I find this one to be my favourite of the Wychwood brews!

Fat Weasel Lager;Portland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Certainly at a level above the Yellow fuzzies, perhaps a stepping stone into micros for the uncultured palates of the masses. It's not bad......for a lager.
Fat Weasel Lager;Portland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Semi-healthy bronze appearance in this lager which exudes an aroma characterized by indiscernable spice notes. This is a medium to full bodied lager, again, with pungent spicy components that I fail to pinpoint. Still, no mystery that this lager is mediocre.
Fat Weasel Lager;Portland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);I don't like lagers too much, so I won't comment....................
Fat Weasel Lager;Portland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Deep golden color and quick but full head with no lacing. A cute sweet nose and a modest balanced fuller light bodied beer. Way better than Gatorade on a hot day.
J.G. Crummers Kick Arse Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;2010 Autumn Festival of Ales - I thought, not another Amber ale, but this was different.

Custom Brewcrafters Pizza Plant Inferno Pod Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Custom Brewcrafters;On tap at Pizza Plant in Williamsville, NY. The beer is brewed specifically for the restaurant and it paired perfectly with the pizza/pub fare the place serves. When the beer was brought over to the table, it still had a small white head and the beers crisp smell was immediatly noticed. The ale had a very robust and full bodied taste, but it was still very drinkable. Their were light notes of citrus and some earthy woodsiness as well. However, these all took a back seat to the beers hoppy characteristics. Overall it was a very good beer and it was a perfect start to the night.
Custom Brewcrafters Pizza Plant Inferno Pod Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Custom Brewcrafters;Draught at The Pizza Plant, sampled from VeloVampire - Big hoppy nose, fruity and dry. The taste is a really nice hop blast, but far from overpowering. Grapefruity and piney off the top, then there’s an unusual earthy taste in the middle and towards the finish (not unpleasant). Fresh, well balanced hoppiness, and a little spicy. This actually reminded me somewhat of Mill Street’s Tankhouse Ale in Toronto.
Custom Brewcrafters Pizza Plant Inferno Pod Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Custom Brewcrafters;On tap at the Pizza Plant - HELP!!!! The pods are coming......A super solid IPA with aroma of hops and some malt in there - the body is robust and the taste is much the same, hops and some strange earthiness, almost soil-like. Good though. Neat finish. Aw man, I loved my pod.
Custom Brewcrafters Pizza Plant Inferno Pod Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Custom Brewcrafters;Draught at 2006 Fall Festival of Ales. An occasional IPA is enough for my palate, and this one fits the bill. Not overpowering on the hops. The toastiness in the malts balances the palate well. Very solid example of the style.
Custom Brewcrafters Pizza Plant Inferno Pod Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Custom Brewcrafters;Dark colour head,lace. Very very bitter, acidic more than citrus. Cannot score high in mouthfeel.Some hop aroma. Good carbonation. This can use more balance
Custom Brewcrafters Pizza Plant Inferno Pod Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Custom Brewcrafters;Draught at Pizza Plant, Williamsport, NY. Pours a clear dark copper with a small off-white head. Big aroma of fresh hops with a touch of fruity malt. The flavour, as the aroma would lead you to believe, is quite hoppy but not excessively -- it’s really tasty, well balanced and fresh. Smooth and clean palate. I wouldn’t bother if you aren’t a fan of hoppy beers but I am and I really liked it.
Custom Brewcrafters Pizza Plant Inferno Pod Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Custom Brewcrafters;Draught. Shared with blankboy at Pizza Plant, Williamsport, NY. Poured clear amber-red with a small off-white head. Aroma was initially quite mild, but opened a lot on warming - fresh medium hops, some very light hints of lightly roast malt and woodiness. Taste - *there* are the hops - lots of resiny, fresh hops, with spruce and hardwood notes (I only sampled this one, and burped hops for half an hour). Mouthfeel astringent and lively - quite complex for a hops-only brew. I quite liked it, but it’s a one-noter - but I was intrigued by the woody nature of the hops, unusual to me, definitely not just cascade hops - must be the hot pepper, which I didn’t actually taste.
Barnstormers Red Baron Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Malty aroma and flavor, with a tiny hint of chocolate. Dark for an amber, but that''s okay with me!

Bug Jar Brown Hornet Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Custom Brewcrafters;Nothing on nose, nothing on first sip, but then there is a wallop of hops suddenly. Nice fun. Update 1 Feb 10 - Got a growler over the weekend, fresh out of the fermentor. Nice color, head and lace. Honey and malt on nose, honey, pecans and malt on palate. Really exceptional, the best I’ve had from CB.

Old Toad Nut Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Pours a very dark brown with a thin tan head and a bit of lacing as it goes down. It has a nice nutty smell that mixes with the toasted malt. The taste is of the nuts upfront followed by an odd metallic and acidic flavor. I don’t know if the tap lines were dirty or what but there was a very odd finish to this brew. As this brew warmed, the odd skunky flavor increased and really drew my attention away from all of the nice things that were going on. This was definitely not the smooth nut brown that I would expect.
Old Toad Nut Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;"2010 Autumn Festival of Ales. Poured a dark reddish brown. Thin off-white head.

Old Toad Nut Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Growler from the brewery. Pours chestnut brown with a one finger tan head. Aroma of sweet, smoked nuts and a mild hoppy spiciness. Flavor follows suit with smokey maltiness dominating, but a definite sprucey hops character is there, along with a mild earthy richness. Moderately thick mouth feel, smoothly carbonated.

Old Toad Sheffield Best Bitter;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Custom Brewcrafters;Cask. Warm, brownish orange color with some red hues. Nutty malt aroma. I enjoy the hops/malt balance with the even bitter finish. Has a dry nutty feel with a smooth velvety texture. Tastes like toffee and graham crackers. Served at the proper temperature and absolutely flat. A great beer. Could use some more body and a bit more complexity.
Old Toad Sheffield Best Bitter;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Custom Brewcrafters;Very thin and slightly bitter. Extremely British tasting for being made in Upstate NY, i.e. not an abundance of flavor.
Old Toad Sheffield Best Bitter;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Custom Brewcrafters;It tastes and looks as a bitter should. Of course that is not always a good thing, but in this case it is.
Old Toad Sheffield Best Bitter;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Custom Brewcrafters;Bitterness and malt nicely balance, but lacks hops aroma and flavor. Nice on hand-pump.

Steel Brewing Howling Monkey;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I never knew that the makers of steel reserve 211 made anything else, especially something i've had. Its been a little while, but since no one has rated it yet I'll give a general overview. This was not very good. They didn't get the whole black and tan mixture thing right. No wonder the monkey looks like that. The bottles were really weird too. It was too bitter for me and I'm damn glad i haven't seen it since.

Mahrs Bräu Leicht;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Mahrs Bräu;"Das Sommer Pils (ehemals ""Leicht"" - Doppelt gelistet) der Mahrs Bräu aus Bamberg, Oberfranken. Die Brauerei hat für ihre Biere neue Etiketten herstellen lassen, hierbei leider auch einige Namen geändert, dass Bier bleibt natürlich gleich! Die Kronkorken sind geprägt und in Etikettenfarbe lackiert. Der neue Bierkastenpfand von 9 €uro ist denke ich auch einmalig. Das Etikett, Neu und Alt gefällt mir gut. Goldgelb im Glas, klar filtriert, die Schaumentwicklung ist anfangs sehr gut. Fruchtig frischer Antrunk, leichter maischiger Malzkörper trifft auf feine Citrusnoten. Der Hopfen im Abgang ist gut schmeckbar (Hallertauer Perle) und erzeugt eine harmonische Bittere. Eine richtig gute Alternative zum süssen Radler. Schmeckt gut. Bekannte Auszeichnungen: Australian International Beer Awards Gold 2016 / World Beer Cup Silber 2016."
Mahrs Bräu Leicht;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Mahrs Bräu;Also das ist wirklich die allerbeste Alternative zum süssen Radler. Soviel Pilsgeschmack bei halben Umdrehungen gibts warscheinlich kein zweites Mal. Super würzig, schön hopfig wie ein Pilsner!

Mahrs Bräu Leicht;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Mahrs Bräu;Bottle. Clear pale golden color with big white head. Aroma is sweetish crackers and noble hops. Taste is sweet grains, more noble hops, crisp. Medium carbonation. A good Leichtes, it?s not too sweet and has enough hops to make it thirst-quenching.
Mahrs Bräu Leicht;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Mahrs Bräu;Bottle at home again style ticking has taken me to a world I’d rather not be. Dirty gold color, probably an old bottle. Nose is some lemon and cleaner. Tastes of 409, lemon, grains, floral, and stale hops. Watery but not terrible palate. Not very good
Mahrs Bräu Leicht;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Mahrs Bräu;Bottle from Aldi drunk in a park in Bamberg. Very pale gold colour lasting white head Lots of carbonation in appearance. One of the better leichts ive had in that it isn’t terrible. Lots of light lemon flavour. Even some flowery hop presence especially on the finish. Some toast from the low abv. It’s fine.

Mahrs Bräu Leicht;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Mahrs Bräu;Yet another mistaken purchase, as I suspected that the ’leicht’ on the label meant light... but since I spent some months in Bamberg years ago and couldn’t remember this particular brewery, I gave it a shot. It is a pleasant, very light lager beer. I believe that this would compare quite well with other brews in this category, which damns with faint praise indeed.

California Rollin Wasabi Brew;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Custom Brewcrafters;Draft at Cali Rollin - Take this beer out of the sushi bar and I wouldn’t even give it a second taste.

Aroma of barley and eastern spices. Goes amazing with great sushi as ClarkVV and Bucknaked both pointed out. Wasbi undertones are subtle with soy rounding out the circle of flavors. I would drink this beer without sushi but the entire sushi experience at the restaurant is what makes this brew so special. Also good for saki bombs while singing Tiny Dancer.

Oasis Capstone ESB;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oasis Brewing Company;nice caramel aroma. i thought i wiffed some odd berry, but who knows. really smooth, i think it’s really balanced too. at first i’m at battle with a creamy maltiness and a small of spike of hops even shows up, but it mellows quite swiftly--and i like this. that berry thing comes up later as well. this should be more assertive, though. i think this is not quite a bitter, but then again my favorite beers are absurdly bitter! i would drink this again.

Oasis Tut Brown Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Oasis Brewing Company;Dark brown body with some ruby highlights. The head is slightly yellow. The aroma is Cheerios and some light motor oil. The taste is rich with Cheerios and some caramel. There is a strange coppery finish with some light grass. A strange brown ale.
Oasis Tut Brown Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Oasis Brewing Company;The Tut Brown pours out just right, a clear, caramel-y brown shade, adorned with a thick, creamy head. Aroma is mild, nutty, coppery, and slightly spicy. As for taste, we get richness right away, sweet, juicy malt, and just a drizzle of hops. Body is medium/light, and texture has something up front, a light hop bite, then fading. Finish is brief, but pleasant enough. Taste remains sweet and happy throughout, but toward the end this brew peters out and leaves my palate aching for more flavor, somewhere, anywhere. But if the old tastebuds weren’t in such a mood, this would be one fine session ale, for sure.
Oasis Tut Brown Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Oasis Brewing Company;Not a good example of the style. Dark brown body under foamy beige head. The nose and the flavor had hints of nuttiness, some caramel, dough. Watery with medium carbonation. Bitterness. Just not very appealing.

Wild Onion Paddy Pale Ale;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Wild Onion Brewery;Aroma pine, some citrus and a note of caramel..Orange amber color with a white head. Sweet malt up front...kind of off. Piney bitterness next. Finish is a bit unbalanced.with a weird after taste. Sub par.
Thomas Creek Multi Grain;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Thomas Creek Brewery;From an old rating note (on tap in Charleston I think): Cloudy orange brown pour. Wheat, lemon, and grass in the aroma. Tastes - grain, metallic, pepper. Wasn’t impressed overall.
Thomas Creek Multi Grain;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Thomas Creek Brewery;Hazy orange, medium beige head. Very grainy aroma with some skunk. Taste is very acidic and strange.
Thomas Creek Multi Grain;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Thomas Creek Brewery;Pours a lasting but no lace off-white head with a golden body. Smells of clean malt and grain. Flavor is clean and crisp. Sour, cardboard, lots of carbonation, band-aid, dog’s back. Infected.
Thomas Creek Multi Grain;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Thomas Creek Brewery;Bottle: Thanks Secret Santa! Pours golden with good clarity and an enormous white head. Oxidized & sweet in the nose- some papery notes, mild caramel and a light off tartness (is it infected?) Painfully over-carbonated. Voluminously effervescent- masks the actual body. Lightly sweet grains mesh with a nondescript tartness and some papery dusty notes. It’s apparently infected, and oxidized. This bottle was either past it’s prime, mistreated, or something went wrong during bottling. I’d give a fresher/better condition bottle another shot- potentially a mediocre beer.
Thomas Creek Multi Grain;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Thomas Creek Brewery;Old bottles showed up at a local shop, brewery rep says it has not been brewed since Dec 07. Clear golden color with lots of carbonation, three big fingers of lumpy white head that falls slowly in a dome the sides of the glass left clean. Aroma is wheaty, grainy. Taste is grains, toasty malt and some spiciness.
Thomas Creek Multi Grain;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Thomas Creek Brewery;Another beer from TC that is not terribly impressive. I enjoy the grain flavors and am a fan of the style, so i enjoyed this a little more than i feel i should have.
Thomas Creek Multi Grain;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Thomas Creek Brewery;hazy greenish/gold pour with a large white head. honey, butter, and hop aroma. the usual sourness expected from TC is in full effect here. a total infected mess as usual. has some hops, lemon, and pepper notes though.
Thomas Creek Multi Grain;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Thomas Creek Brewery;"A light body and pleasent malty flavor. Some grainy and hay also. Nothing special. But not ""bland""."
Thomas Creek Multi Grain;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Thomas Creek Brewery;"Bottle courtesy decaturstevo. I love the Commercial Description: ""a refreshing pallet."" But this beer tastes better than a pallet to my palate. Kinda boring though. Maybe they can grind up some of the pallets to make a high fiber version."
Thomas Creek Multi Grain;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Thomas Creek Brewery;12oz bottle. Light amber color with wisps of white head. Aroma is spicy with a flavor like sweet multi grain bread. The first few sips were really interesting. Then I just slugged it down.

Wisconsin Rainbow Red Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;This is a cool looking beer. It is medium brown in color and reminds me to tea. It also has a nice tan foam that doesn’t last long. The aroma is sweet and malty. Flavor is sweet caramel malt with some hops underneath. The malt clearly dominates. Occasionally the hops show up more that at other times.
Wisconsin Rainbow Red Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;This amber ale smelled and tasted a lot more like a brown ale than an amber ale to me. Barely noticable hop presence made this red overly malty. The malts were very sweet and sugary in taste. Not at all representative of a good amber.
Wisconsin Rainbow Red Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Pours out a somewhat dark shade of orange with a small off white head. Aroma is sweet. THe taste is sweet with some notes of fruit and some sweet caramel finish. A very drinkable beer, solid effort
Wisconsin Rainbow Red Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Color was a deep orange-like brown color and rather opaque. The head came up slightly with a tan color and dissipated fairly quickly, leaving only a few traces behind as I drained the glass. The aroma overall was sweet with fruity tones to it, although I could detect a whiff of caramel. My first impression was the sweetness from the malts which resulted in the flavors of fruits and caramel. After a bit more of a taste, I could detect the hops better and the taste seemed to take on a more toffee-like flavor to it with grapefruit undertones. It’s definitely a complex brew with a medium, rich body to it. The hops kicked in a bit more on the finish, giving it a spicy-like taste. There’s no great kick from the carbonation which is mild.
Wisconsin Rainbow Red Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;"""Medium to dark amber color. Small head with good lacin. Aroma was sweet and floral. Medium bodied. Taste sweet and friuity. Taste better as it warms. Has a spice to it pepper like others said. Sweet after taste."""
Wisconsin Rainbow Red Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;I got this one in my beer club. I have never heard of the brewer before. Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a ruby chestnut color with a small tan head that faded quickly. The aroma was sweet and grapefruity. The flavor was fruity, nutty and lightly earthy with a sweet nutty finish.
Wisconsin Rainbow Red Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Yep, it’s red! Nice solid creampuff of a head. Interesting caramel aroma. The flavor reminds me of gingersnap cookies, or something ... bready, yet sweet, with a dry honey-clove finish.
Wisconsin Rainbow Red Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Reddish orange. Nose of candied oranges, sugars, few hops. Flavor is sweet, lots of caramel, some bright fruit, hops for balance at the end. Quite dry and toasty in the finish. An enjoyable session beer, could drink a number of these.
Wisconsin Rainbow Red Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Fairly dark amber body with a yellowish head. Aroma of bourbon, peaches and a little perfume. The taste is relatively dry orange peels. There is also some bread crust and grapefruit background. The caramel character comes to play after you have a few drinks.
Wisconsin Badger Porter;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Sand Creek Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle, Sand Creek label, from Woodman's Oak Creek. Dark brown, thin fizzy tan head fair retention. Aroma of roast, clay, green coffee. Taste is chocolate, roast, sunflower seeds. Thin. Very weak porter. Meh.

Wisconsin Badger Porter;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Sand Creek Brewing Company;"Bottle: Pours dark, clear, ruby-brown with a creamy beige head. Cocoa, dark grain aroma.

Wisconsin Badger Porter;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Sand Creek Brewing Company;"Honestly, fuck this. It’s not 2002 so why are these guys making 2002 ""microbrew."" This stuff looks okay and even has a nice chocolatey smell at first but digging deeper, it is just laden w/ off-notes and brewing flaws. Oxidized cardboard and weird cherry-ish notes abound along w/ salty soy-sauce notes which you normally only find in high gravity stuff. One needs only to look at the bottom shelf of the cheap beer section of your grocery store to find a better Wisconsin brew."
Wisconsin Badger Porter;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Sand Creek Brewing Company;An okay porter. Dark, but not particularly thick. Mild at the beginning with roastiness coming on strong at the end.

Pioneer Lager;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Courtesy of Skyview. Very murky brown/orange color with a quickly collapsing large head. Fairly heavy floral and citrus hops for a pale lager. Those fade in the flavor a lot. Mostly grains and caramel.

Pioneer Lager;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sand Creek Brewing Company;hazy amber, medium quickly dissipating head, tiny white bubbles with slight lacing. not at all pale lagery looking. very sweet malt, perhaps hint of hop in nose. flavor is earthy malt and floral hops which do not offset each other very well. no body, mildly bitter finish. i like lagers, so this one is disappointing in its complete lack of lagerliness. 6 pack from liquor depot in monee.
Pioneer Lager;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Amber in color with no head and low carbonation. Aroma is a bit nutty with some biscuit aromas. Flavor is nothing really special, low caramel sweetness and little bit of a walnut taste. Overall not too impressive of a beer but definitely better than the macro options.
Pioneer Lager;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sand Creek Brewing Company;A none too impressive lager, tasting largely of malty corn. The Beer of the Month people need to try a little harder.
Pioneer Lager;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sand Creek Brewing Company;This came from the BOM club. Really not that good. Oh well. How much can you say about a beer you will probably never drink again?
Pioneer Lager;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sand Creek Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Poured a clear dark orange color. Head was two fingers high and off white with decent retention. Some lace was left behind at the end. There were whiffs of biscuity malt and subdued caramel, but not much else.

Pioneer Pale Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sand Creek Brewing Company;"Hazy orange color. Head was decent. No aroma. Dry- little bit of sweetness. This one falls into the category of- ""please introduce me to the brewer responsible for this sad excuse for a beer so that I can have his/her head checked"". Why do some people bother? Please, someone answer that for me."
Pioneer Pale Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sand Creek Brewing Company;This pours a hazy light honey. Floaties. The average frothy white head is mostly diminishing with good lacing. The tame nose is piney and slightly flowery and bready. The flavor though shallow has decent balance. Average hoppy nutty finish, though not as bitter as I was anticipating. The light watery body is soft and feels metallic at the finish. Good session beer. Better than average.
Pioneer Pale Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sand Creek Brewing Company;The pour is a clear amber, the head is white, the lace is adequate. Nose is malt, and a bit buttery. Front is sweet, the top light, the finish is dry, acidic, lightly hopped and pretty mediocre as pales go, can't say I disagree with the other ratings. Ranks #929 on my current 1000 beer master list.
Pioneer Pale Ale;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sand Creek Brewing Company;"I never heard of Pioneer before receiving a six-pack via a mail-order beer club.

Pioneer Black River Red;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sand Creek Brewing Company;This beer is really pretty decent, but still nothing much to it. I like some more complexity.
Pioneer Black River Red;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Poured a deep red-amber with a decent head that faded to a nice lace. Aroma was of sweet malts with a hint of apple & fruit. Taste was of a nutty malt with a fairly smooth light to moderate hop finish. Palate was decent. Overall, this is a nice malty Marzen that the folks at Sand Creek should be proud of.
Pioneer Black River Red;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sand Creek Brewing Company;The pour is an amber/orange color with a minimal off-white head. The nose is very buttery (lots of diacetyl) with some light notes of roasted/toasted malts. The flavor is bland and watery with some mild toast and a hint of candied orange peel.

Pioneer Black River Red;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Amber, light haze, thin off white head, no real lacing. Aroma of chocolate malt with a sulfury undertone. First taste was downright bad, lightly roasted malt ruined by a touch of rotten egg. Fortunately the sulfur element mellows out quickly, and the rest comes across as a palatable malty amber, chocolate and cider. Medium body.
Pioneer Black River Red;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Draft at OF. Filtered red-brown color. Solid off-white head. Mellow sweet amber-lager aroma. Mellow and creamy, with some orange-vanilla amber malt nuances. Medium bodied, quite drinkable. Doesn’t really capture much of the Oktoberfest flavor, certainly more of an Amber Lager. Quite smooth, with a very pleasant Lagfer yeast mouthfeel.
Pioneer Black River Red;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Courtesy of Skyview. Dark copper color with a medium head. Aroma started light caramel, and quickly vanished completely. Thick body and chewy, yet somehow almost flavorless, malt. Caramel sweetness.

Sweet aroma of caramel, bread, and just a touch of hops. The palate is a bit thin, but very smooth. Fairly well-balanced flavor starts in with the caramel sweetness. In the middle is a flavor almost like tea which is followed by a hint of hoppy bitterness. The finish is sweet again with a hint of brown sugar. This is a good beer, but not as full-flavored as some other Oktoberfests.
Pioneer Black River Red;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Thick reddish copper with next to no head. Aroma of caramel, nuts, sweet malt and brown sugar. Taste of sweet malt and not much else. Some nut bitterness, some cloying properties but mostly bland and ho-hum from first to the last drop.
Lang Creek Good Medicine Brown Ale;Marion, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Tap @ Barley’s Kalispell, MT. Nice dark amber/brown color with a ruby tint, thin beige head that didn’t last. Aroma was weak. Flavor was of molasses and soy sauce. Dissapointing. The Tri motor amber was considerably better but it too was rather weak and unremarkable.
Lang Creek Good Medicine Brown Ale;Marion, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Faint malty aroma. Over carbonated. Faintly roasted. Low hops. Watery. Bland. These are not positive things. Have to be a much better brown to compete with moose drool as far as montana browns go.
Lang Creek Good Medicine Brown Ale;Marion, Montana, United States;Brown Ale;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;I didn't care for this one at all. It definately didn't explode on the palate, as it says. the beer was somewhat thin, light brown in color, The flavor was of light malt, nothing distinctive about it. Unimpressive.
Lang Creek Taildragger Honey Wheat;Marion, Montana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;On tap @ GF Blues and Brews Festival. Pours a golden yellow color. Aromas of wheat bread and a touch of hops. Flavor is sweet wheat with a scattering of hops at the end.

Sweet malty aroma, loads of biscuit, cookie dough and medium crystal along with some earthy and citrusy hops. Flavour is also malty, cookie dough and biscuit, some honeyish flavours as well. A bit thinner and dryer than the body might have suggested. Very faint diacetyl. Good, if typical.
Lang Creek Windsock Pale Ale;Marion, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Bright copper colour. Earthy hop, vienna malts and a spicy yeast make up the flavour profile. The aroma is mainly the yeast spiciness and straightforward bread/caramel malt character.
Lang Creek Windsock Pale Ale;Marion, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Summer 02 (?). Bottle. recently discovered notes...I like this beer, but not as much as the other APAs I've tried. Pours clouded and amber/orange. Lots of hops on nose, floral, but also bell pepper. Not cascadey, I don't think. Flavors are dominated by hops, but not very bitter. This beer can't seem to make up its mind - it's not very bitter, nor very malty, nor giving me a great sense of balance. Back to the drawing board with this one. Finish IS very clean and dry and beer looks great.
Lang Creek Windsock Pale Ale;Marion, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - English;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Hazy pale amber. Good fruity hop nose. Highly hopped throughout. Long finish is more like an IPA. Great lace

Lang Creek Glacier Pilot Winter Warmer;Marion, Montana, United States;Strong Ale - English;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Richy, full, woody brow-amber with frothy-browned cream head. Sweet hops greet the nose and an inkling of holiday spices, perhaps allspice and cinnamon. Mouthfeel is mildly hoppy and spicy, and again lightly spiced and with the noted presence of caramel malts. Rather thin body. Some cardboard hop finish on back-end. Dissapointingly under-bodied for an ESA. Had they boiled off more wort and fermented a higher OG brew, this would have the chance to be stellar stuff.
Lang Creek Glacier Pilot Winter Warmer;Marion, Montana, United States;Strong Ale - English;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;208 Bottle - Pours a dk brown with a small off white head...aroma is rich with honey malt but something is missing...flavour is horrendous, thin on the front and bitter on the end with very little character in between, finishes with a bit of roasted pine...sory to say this was a drain pour for me...

Lang Creek Glacier Pilot Winter Warmer;Marion, Montana, United States;Strong Ale - English;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Bottle from John’s Marketplace in Portland, OR. Beautiful mahogany color with a multi-finger beige/tan head. Aroma of resin backed by citrus. Near full bodied with vigorous, near creamy carbonation. Flavor is quite resiny, backed by heavy caramel, finishing balanced, evergreeny, and mouthsmacking. Just excellent. Makes me think of gin.
Lang Creek Glacier Pilot Winter Warmer;Marion, Montana, United States;Strong Ale - English;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;2007. Dark beer that smells like trees. as it warmed the tree smell mellowed and tasted less like a tree and more like a beer being consumed in a forest. A chocolate flavor emerged as it warmed. They didn’t go crazy trying to add too many competing flavors, and did try for something original. Perhaps a bit of coriander would have assisted the mid-palate.
Lang Creek Glacier Pilot Winter Warmer;Marion, Montana, United States;Strong Ale - English;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;2007 edition in the bottle from 99 Bottles in Federal Way WA. Pours an extremely dark brown to almost black with a very thin and hardly present off white head. Some roastedness to the aroma, but not much otherwise. Good mouthfeel, as it warms, I get a pleasant burst of milk chocolate. This is like Our Special Ale, if Anchor put not spices in the beer. Still, I get a mild bit of pine and juniper to the flavor. OK, but not great.

Granville Island Cypress Honey Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Clear dark straw color with moderate activity. Slightly foamy white 2 finger head, lasting around 2 minutes, with faint legs. Flavors of caramel, sweet corn and barley, faint honey and lemon, and some herbal spices. Sugary cereals, minimal bitterness. Slick full body with prickly carbonation. Light weak finish, a dash of caramel and very subtle honey, and a bit of grassy and leafy hops..hardly no honey. Very soft and bland. Okay freshness, weak flavors, overly accessible, but doesn’t feel too adjunct. Overall poor quality craft.
Granville Island Cypress Honey Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Appearance: clear pale gold with a short-lived white head, minimal patchy lacing. (3/5) Aroma: grassy, pale crackery malt, corn, honey, light fruit. (5/10) Taste: moderate sweet, mild bitter. (5/10) Light body, moderate carbonation, medium-dry and crisp mildly bitter finish. (3/5) Unsurprisingly, it’s pretty similar to their Island Lager. The honey is definitely present, but doesn’t make the beer appreciably sweeter. It’s also not significantly better in any realistic way. One could certainly make for a decent break from the other, perhaps. I could see alternating between the two on a hot day floating on the Shuswap, for example. Again, however, I wouldn’t necessarily go looking for this. (11/20)
Granville Island Cypress Honey Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Good for a light lager, but still quite bland for a beer. Could use some more body, but it's not overly carbonated like most in this style. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Granville Island 15th Anniversary Cream Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Unique cherry aroma. Initial mouthfeel is soft, good for this brewery but the carbonation is still too fizzy. Mild, smooth body that is round and relatively well-balanced. Definate lager characteristics but not reminiscent of any others I’ve tried. As it warms the beer tastes better, fuller in body. Nice effort.

Creemore Springs Premium Lager;Creemore, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Creemore Springs Brewery (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Can (random shop, Canada). Straight from the can. Malty, watery, grainy, fizzy in aroma/taste. Quite pointless brew.

Aroma brings out fresh grassy notes, a herbaceous character, and bready malt. Flavour is fresh and clean, with grassy hops, biscuity malt and a nice herbaceous character. Very clean and bright lager. Good stuff.
Creemore Springs Premium Lager;Creemore, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Creemore Springs Brewery (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Not sure what the hell is going in here, but it ain’t good. Weird buttered popcorn malts on top of sweet corn and yeast, followed by a mineral-laden mild floral bitterness. Canadian Yuengling?

The aroma is of tea, white wheat bread, and yeast. Taste is of tea, bitterness, brown bread crust, and a touch of fruit. There is also a steam beer aspect, here. Mouthfeel is medium, and Creemore Springs Premium Lager finishes crisp and refreshing. RJT
Creemore Springs Premium Lager;Creemore, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Creemore Springs Brewery (Six Pints - Molson Coors);I liked this lager (not my favourite style) because it trended toward a malty hop ale taste And was slightly darker in colour.
Creemore Springs Premium Lager;Creemore, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Creemore Springs Brewery (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Sampled on draft this beer poured a dark honey gold color with a medium sized foamy white head that left decent lacing.

Thomas Kemper Mason Jar Marzen;Seattle, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;Bottle. A hazy golden amber color with a tan head. A sweet malt body with a dry and slightly tangy palate. Malts coat the mouth and leave a long aftertaste.
Thomas Kemper Mason Jar Marzen;Seattle, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;Cloudy amber,beige head. Small but scarce bead. Corny nose. Corn grainy palate.

Thomas Kemper Mason Jar Marzen;Seattle, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;Fruity esters little else in the nose, few bubbles thin head, dark amber color. Milky texture. A gaping hole between the front and back ends. Something evil lurks in there -- bacteria? Another undrinkable at the Pyramid brewery in Berkeley.
Thomas Kemper Mason Jar Marzen;Seattle, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;Not much in the way of aroma. Flavor is not intense, but what is there is enjoyable enough. Nice carbonation, and does have enough going on to make it somewhat unique. Not bad.
Thomas Kemper Mason Jar Marzen;Seattle, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;strange red-amber colour, few foam, caramel, quite light-bodied, slightly disturbing sourness
Thomas Kemper Mason Jar Marzen;Seattle, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;A good Marzen. Not the best by any stretch. But it's good, clean malty fun. A nice little beer, with a pretty good nose.
Thomas Kemper Mason Jar Marzen;Seattle, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;Hmmm...wondering where all this talk of robustness comes from. I had it at the Portland Spring Beer Fest in '99, and found it to be like the festival itself - kind of thin and without a lot of character.
Thomas Kemper Mason Jar Marzen;Seattle, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;Dark and mysterious color. Heavy aroma. Strong malt. Bold and strong body. Some slightly sour off-flavors interrupted my enjoying this beer to its fullest.
Kasteel Donker;Emelgem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;"Before try this beer i seen very good comments everywhere but the beer surpass any imagination.. This beer is really insane.. All here is almost perfect and difficult you can find weakness.. First of all the Aroma is great and remind you some ""Rochefort"" or some classic dark beer. The mouthfeel is even better.. You feel the flavors when the beer touch your mouth.. The flavors go very fast in your mouth and the finish is just endless and amazing too. Some awesome bitterness in there.. But the most important of this beer is the taste. The taste is incridible good.. Many chocolate, caramel and dark fruits notes.. The beer give you some refreshing flavors in your mouth despite the ""12°C"" serving temperature. Overall one of the best beers i have try in my life.. This beer is simply amazing.."
Okanagan Spring Porter;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Porter - Baltic;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Dark dark brown pour with tan head. Smells of malted chocolate, light smoke, roast, a little coffee. Flavor is much the same - a smooth beer that hides the abv well under a simple but pleasant maltiness.
Okanagan Spring Porter;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Porter - Baltic;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);nearly pitch black with a crisp head that dissipates quickly. figgy flavour balanced with toasty dark malt, delivered through a clear and concise filtered body. great winter beer. doesn't go overboard on anything that a porter can go overboard with (sweet, dry, boozy...). bang for your buck at 8.5 percent abv doesn't hurt it's rep.
Okanagan Spring Porter;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Porter - Baltic;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);This has been my favourite beer for years. having immigrated from Germany i have missed the dark and malty beers that many pubs still tho this day brew themselves. This porter is smooth with tons of flavor and a rich but yet mellow finish.. This one is a winner.. love it
Okanagan Spring Porter;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Porter - Baltic;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);"Dark brown color with small head. A lot of dark malts, and light liquorice feeling; good body strength, a bit of alcohol; moderately sweet; some stale feeling too; it reminds me of South German dunkels, but bolder."
Okanagan Spring Porter;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Porter - Baltic;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Pours a dark brown with red tinges when aimed at the light. The taste is roasted malts, cocoa, dark fruits and coffee. Has a nice bitterness that gives balance. good beer
Okanagan Spring Porter;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Porter - Baltic;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Pours dark, frothy head. Aroma of cherries and chocolate. Taste is the same, chalky mouth feel.
Okanagan Spring Porter;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Porter - Baltic;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);341 ml bottle. Pours black with deep amber highlights in edges, very dissipating tan head, some lacing. Aromas of chocolate coffee caramel roasted malts. Taste coffee chocolate and caramel malt. Nice lasting finish, well balanced.
Okanagan Spring Porter;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Porter - Baltic;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Only the second decently done beer from Okanagan Springs I know of(brewmasters is the other). Pours and almost opaque black with a frothy brown head. Aroma of roasted malts, cocoa, dried fruits and something lightly off and maybe buttery. Taste is roasted malts, chocolate, cocoa and dark dried fruits with a dry finish. Nice big full body porter. But just not the balance that the style requires... Needs some fine tuning.
Okanagan Spring Porter;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Porter - Baltic;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Drank out of small bottle. Minimal aroma above a slightly chocolatey malt. Taste is sweet. Thin mouthfeel.
Okanagan Spring Porter;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Porter - Baltic;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);This porter poured a deep black colour with a big, beautiful, creamy, light brown head. Scents include ripe fruit, cocoa, roasted malts and caramel. First swig was creamy and sweet with flavours of caramel and roasted malt being the most predominant. Finish is thick, sweet and roasty with malt flavours lingering.
Okanagan Spring Premium Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Quite forgettable, but drinkable. Tastes of pale malts and grass. Has a light watery body with some carbonation. I forgot anything else about this standard lager.
Okanagan Spring Premium Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);341mL bottle pours pale golden with small white head and virtually no lacing. Aroma is very mild grain. Taste is very plain with little hops in the finish. Decent carbonation but a light body. Just another run of the mill lager.
Okanagan Spring Premium Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Slightly better than the bavarian but still lacks real taste of aroma. Nice in appearance but appearances can be deceiving very bland tasting lager.
Okanagan Spring Premium Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);A - Yeasty and spicy A - Yellow with thin white head T - Dry with subtle bitter finish P - Thin, but nice and crisp O - Not a bad lager, just a bit light for me
Okanagan Spring Premium Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);The bottle says Original Lager and its a new package but OH WELL.... Not much of a smell there, but if there was, I would call it new and improved cardboard lite! Smells less cardboardy than our usual cardboard! I mean beer! HAha we don’t put cardboard in our beer... not much head or lacing or haze, but I’m struggling so I’ll give an extra point for the almost red hue. Taste isn’t BAD, but it isn’t good either. This isn’t sessionable, cuz after 3 I’d be sick of it and never buy it again, except it’s pre-mixed into the multi-box. Why don’t they let you make your own multi-box?
Okanagan Spring Premium Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Marketed under the Okanagan Springs label. Pours a clear yellow with a small, dense, creamy white head. Aroma has a grainy, slight corny sweetness and a mild spicy noble hops nose. Flavor has a very harsh graininess to it at first, mild lemon note in the middle, slight spicy noble hops toward the end and a sour acidic ending. Body is light and fizzy with a slight dryness at the end. Overall not too enjoyable as the grainy and lemon flavors really don’t seem to work well on my palate.
Okanagan Spring Premium Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Bottled sample via my brother-in-law’s mixed twelve box. Clear gold in colour with strong carbonation. Grainy upfront on the nose, along with some sulfur and a hint of citrus. Flavors are of white bread dough, minerals, and a bit more of that faint citrus note. Medium bodied. Hoppier and better than expected.
Okanagan Spring Premium Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Acceptable pale lager, nice hoppy notes on the aroma and has a slight sweet maly upfront followed by a firm bitterness.
Okanagan Spring Premium Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Pours light yellow. Fairly standard pale lager, but better than average for a mass produced one. Weak and watery mouthful. Nothing special.
Okanagan Spring Premium Lager;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Golden body , a good micro lager with a more full bodied taste then mass pale lager , a bit mild and grainy
Okanagan Traditional Pilsener;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);341mL bottle poured a pale straw color with small white head and no lacing. Aromas of cereal and some citrus. Taste is lightly sweet and has only faint hoppy finish. A very mild pilsener with a light body and some carbonation.
Okanagan Traditional Pilsener;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);As others have noted, the OK Spring Pilsner had potential that went nowhere, like many of the brewery’s other beers.
Okanagan Traditional Pilsener;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Their lager was so good the introduced this but it never gained the popularity of the Lager and Pale Ale
Okanagan Traditional Pilsener;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);I loved this beer, although it tastes more like a Kolsch than a Pilsener. Nice citrus undertones but not a lot of hoppiness. Still a good beer.
Okanagan Traditional Pilsener;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);A respectable hop aroma and floweriness of palate. That said, this is not an overly hoppy beer. It's really for lack of anything else that the hops stand out.
Okanagan Spring Honey Blonde Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);341mL bottle poured a pale straw color with small white head and no lace. Aroma is very mild honey and grain. Taste is lightly sweet with very little hop in the finish. Nice carbonation but light body. A slightly below average blonde ale, especially compared to some of the bolder tasting Belgian blondes.
Okanagan Spring Honey Blonde Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Aroma is pretty weak, and the taste comes off skunky. You get used to it after awhile, but I would not recommend this beer.
Okanagan Spring Honey Blonde Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);smells lightly of alcohol. and pours pale yellow with a big detergent like white head that leaves no lace. tastes of sickly honey. not worth having twice.
Okanagan Spring Honey Blonde Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Slightly thicker looking yellow/gold. Quickly dissipating head. Very light bee pollen aroma. Honey like start with a unpleasant metallic/rust middle and finish.
Okanagan Spring Honey Blonde Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);"skunky aroma. Pours golden yellow, high carbonation, mid-range head. Low malt, palate thin. Honey Blond? This is marketed under the ""Bavarian purity law"" so I can't figure that out. Finish is flat and dull. Another weak effort from a snooze-fest brewery."
Okanagan Spring Honey Blonde Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Not bad, blond ales tend to be watery and flavourless, at least in my opinion but I did notice a little honey in this beer. Bad head, and aroma but decent easy going summer beer for the porch.
Okanagan Spring Honey Blonde Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Poor nose, unpleasant off flavor. Tainted?. Will re rate when I get bored...

Okanagan Spring Pale Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Draught: This one pours a clear amber color.

Schultheiss Berliner Weisse Original;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Many thanks for this old beer to Koelschtrinker. vintage 1970 in small unlabeled bottle. Beer more old than I. Almost half a century. without foam. Pale yellow colour. Drink only half beer. Acid, minimal hoppy, some cider vinegar, some verry dry white wine. Taste some like unblended Lambic. I like sour beer and I like this beer. Still good to drink with only little more than 3% ABV? Whow it's incredible. Thanks Again
Schultheiss Berliner Weisse Original;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);1970s unlabeled bottle. Clear golden, no head.

No signs of oxidation or any obvious long term defects.
Schultheiss Berliner Weisse Original;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Old bottle from Max. Pours a murky brown with a thin white head. Old paper, soft toasty malt. Medium bodied, soft acid, tangy acidity. Definitely old.
Schultheiss Berliner Weisse Original;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);1970s era bottle returned to former GDR territory near Gatow for consumption with Matthias. Nice fizz with cap removal. Pours cloudy yellow color, few bubbles. Aroma of cider and subtle feet. Taste is lightly tart cider and lemon. Amazing that it survived in decent condition.
Schultheiss Berliner Weisse Original;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);15+ year old bottle. Never realized people kept this stuff like a precious treasure. Still pretty drinkable, a tad dusty bit decently sour and fun to drink.
Schultheiss Berliner Weisse Original;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Poured from a bottle, thanks to Jerry. Light color. Light lactic acid, doughy, lemon, dusty, light tannic quality. Refreshing. Very subtle.

Schultheiss Berliner Weisse Original;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);On tap at a resturant in Berlin. Hazy pale golden with white head. Aroma tangy, mild sour, lemon, hay, lacto, citrus and light wood. Taste is medium sour, tart, lemon, citrus, grass, grapes and light apples. Pleasant
Schultheiss Berliner Weisse Original;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Ein Klassiker. Gießt ein trübes Hellgelb mit dünner weißer Schaumkrone ein. Zitronig-säuerliche, hefebetonte Aromen. Im Antrunk anfänglich angenehm sauer mit etwas umami, wird allerdings etwas wässeriger im Abgang. Süffig.
Schultheiss Berliner Weisse Original;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Berliner Weisse;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);(from notes) Moderate lactic, milky aroma with some underlying grain. Initial taste is moderate to low lactic up front with some graininess. Much more sour and tart in the nose than the flavor. Good, but I like them puckering.
Starobrno Premium Lager;Brno, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Starobrno Brewery (Heineken);This lager has fine persistent foam, aroma of malt and a little hops. The taste is slightly caramelized with an appropriate balance between hops and malt. The hops are the classic Czech Saaz with spicy bitterness and little overtones of flower. Very nice lager beer.
Starobrno Premium Lager;Brno, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Starobrno Brewery (Heineken);Tap. Surprisingly good. Rich malty taste, just a bit of metallics if you are really after that. Sweetish. But good.
Starobrno Premium Lager;Brno, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Starobrno Brewery (Heineken);Da die Starobrno-Brauerei ebenso wie die österreichische Brau-Union zum Heineken-Konzern gehört, bekommt man es auch schon in vielen Wiener Wirtshäusern. An besten schmeckt es aber sicher im Brauhaus am Mendelsplatz in Brünn (cz.: Mendlovo námìstí bzw. im Brünner Dialekt: Mendlák) oder in der Brauerei-eigenen Bier-Straßenbahn. Diese kann für Feiern gemietet werden und ist eine Straßenbahn, welche mit einer Bar, einem Klo und bequemen Sitzplätzen und Tischen ausgestattet ist -ich kann sie sehr empfehlen. Aber zurück zum Bier: Es ist ein klassisches tschechisches Helles, das eine enorme Süffigkeit aufweist. Ein frisches Malzaroma unterstreicht die leichten Hopfennoten ohne sie zu überdecken. Ein Bier das vielleicht nichts besonderes ist, aber ein gutes, gemütliches Bier -auch zum Essen dazu.
Schultheiss Lager;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);pretty pissweak. only worth drinking if it's on tap at a berlin kebaberie. slightly australian tasting

Schultheiss Lager Schwarz;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Had this in Berlin in a cafe outside one of the museums on the Island. Not too bad. Slight mineral metallic taste(not in a bad way) Slight roasted flavor. Maybe not the strongest example of Schwarzbier but quite drinkable. Serving: Tap
Schultheiss Lager Schwarz;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);"One of my favorite beers of all time. Drank this while on a trip to Berlin, at a bar I just happened to wander into. From the presentation (stem Schultheiss glass with gold trim and a Schulthiess paper ""bib"" around the bottom) to the head, to the temperature, to the finish, this beer is to me fantastic. While it is indeed a very dark beer, the flavor is quite light, possibly due to the high carbonation. This beer is ideal served highly chilled, and should have around a 1/2 inch head when pulled from the tap. Very nice."

Schultheiss Lager Schwarz;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Sampled this one on draught at a tavern in Berlin. Excellent example of schwarzbier, with lots of good dark malt aromas and flavors, and a touch of roast. Schultheiss Lager Schwarz pours to a beautiful, bright, deep brown to black color, with a thick white head, and a good bit of carbonation. The nose on this beer is excellent ,with good dark chocolate and nutty malt aroma, paired with light aromas of roast. The palate is polished and clean, with a sea of smooth dark malt flavor, coffee, and mild roast. This beer finishes with more of that great dark malt flavor, then ends bone dry and slightly roasty. An excellent schwarzbier, that works well with a number of hearty dishes. A great before and after dinner beer as well.

White chocolate, almond paste, smarties and general kids’ drug aroma. Strange palate, the sweetness is enormous, but the flavours more muted than you would have expected from the nose.

The nose is alcohol and a little fruit. A smokey roast is also evident in the nose with just a touch of fudgeyness towards the back of the aroma. The body is thick with malt which is slightly sweet, but not reaching cloy. Some bitter maltiness in the middle and a touch of bitter hops at the end. Nice long flavors here.

Crooked River Stadium Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);I first had this beer at (Where else?) a Browns game. I forked over my $6 and asked what it really was. The vendor told me that I could tour the brewery which was just down the road a few miles. A grear beer for watching a football game. Crooked River's Ballpark brew (Which they used to serve at Indians gmaes) is pretty much the same thing. Do I buy it for home use? no.
Crooked River Stadium Lager;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crooked River Brewery (Snyder Intl);A nicely balanced every day lager. Brewed with 2-row malt instead of the cheaper 6-row variety. Subtle hops but they're apparent and offer decent bittering to counterbalance the malt. This lager is super smooth and perfect for washing down a bratwurst or pretzel at a football game. Much better than the normal lagers available at football games. Nicely done. Cool can too.

Monte Carlo Silver State Stout;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Stout - Dry;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;26-Feb-06 (Growler: Monte Carlo Resort & Casino) In exchange for taking care of my ex-girlfriend’s cat while she was in Vegas, she had to bring me back some beer, so she came back with a $45 growler of this stout from the brewpub in the Monte Carlo. $45 for a growler! It pours black and opaque, even when held up to the sun that is gradually setting over the Pacific Ocean. Medium-dark tan head forms slowly, but vanishes fairly quickly, settling to a wispy film. The nose is all dry roast and yeast, unimaginative and quite ordinary for a brewpub stout. Again, more of the same dry, bitter roast in the flavor, some yeast and herbal hops flavor, a hint of chocolate perhaps, but as for the bitterness, it’s mostly from burnt roast rather than hops. Medium body on each sip, but thins out in the finish leaving kind of a watery impression. Not a bad beer, but in the end, this is pretty much like a boring, average brewpub stout that you’d find in a large chain.
Monte Carlo Silver State Stout;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Stout - Dry;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;Bottled. Poured medium-deep brown with an explosive cap of tan head.. I’m talkin’ 3/4 of the glass worth. The aroma was soft and dusty with dry chocolate, raw oats, and light dark fruit skins represented.. pleasant enough, but it seemed a touch off. The flavor had dry, somewhat abrasive chocolate and dark fruits on the core surrounded by herbal and spicy notes.. the finish had a drawn-out, ugly, tacky sourness that attached to chocolate that didn’t have much character to it.. kept going downhill the longer I drank it. A bit shy of medium-bodied, and it didn’t feel too good on the palate. Meh.

Monte Carlo Silver State Stout;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Stout - Dry;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a bid bubbly dark brown head with average retention. Aroma of roasted malt and coffee is dominant and very interesting overall. Taste is dominated by slightly bitter malt with long coffee finish.

Never trust a thin chef, or something along those lines. This one is all roast and toast in all aspects. Pours jet black with a thick oatmeal-y head that made it almost all the way to the end. Aroma of roasted malts and currants, hint of oatmeal. Flavour was awesome off the top with roasted malts, toasted cereals, and hints of coffee. Nice all the way through, I was surprised to find something so good in a hotel brewpub.

Monte Carlo Triple Belgian Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Tripel;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;"Pours medium gold-orange with a good off-white head. Aromas of fruits, wheat, banana, etc. Flavor has lots of malt and much the same as in the aroma. Disguises its 10+% alcohol well. Quite true to style; unlike the only other rating from 3 years ago. They must have just got this one on tap. If you are a ""beer geek"" and are on the LV strip, you really should check this one out. Beats all of the other macro-swill crap that you find all too much of."
Monte Carlo Triple Belgian Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Tripel;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;And just how exactly is this a Belgian Tripel? Ok, the alc is there but the taste has quite a bit to go. Attractive deep orange/red color, unimpressive head and medicinal taste all lead me to the belief that this was the brewers first job.

Monte Carlo Winners Wheat;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Wheat Ale;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;I had numerous beers at Monte Carlo before the brewpub closed, the only ones I remembered are the Wheat and the Belgian Wit.

Monte Carlo Winners Wheat;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Wheat Ale;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;Looks nice and cloudy. Smells like a lemon since they stuck one in there. Very stingy and effervescent. Not what I want in my beer. Soda maybe, but not beer.

Monte Carlo Winners Wheat;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Wheat Ale;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;Draught @ The Brewpub: This one was sadly disappointing. Poured a cloudy yellow with no trace of head or lacing whatsoever. Aroma is really gentle, almost non-existent, but a touch of wheat and citrus can be found if you strain. Flavour is HEAVY carbonation, distracting amounts. If you can get past it you might find some malted wheat and citrus flourishes, but it’s just an irrational amount of carbonation. Pour effort.

The nose was soft grain/wheat, touches of dankness & earthiness, and not very expressive yeast notes usually attributed to the style as banana, clove, and fruitiness. Light to medium bodied, with decent carbonation, the taste was similarly light notes, and contributed a modest, earthy bitterness. Still went down easy, and refreshed.

Tenaya Creek Pale Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;on tap at brewpub: im pulling this one from my memory banks because the brewery isnt brewing this one regularly anymore has been replaced by the ring tail IPA. as all their beers a bit thin for me. built for the masses or the macro crowd whos feeling a bit risky. seemed to me to be better when the brewpub opened and got little thinner as time has marched on. the IPA and this one are pretty identical. not a lot of hops but enough to be the only character to speak of and after that crisp and clean and easy to drink. pretty snappy. not that i dont like it but to fit the class we need a bit more robust flavor...all across the board.
Tenaya Creek Pale Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Nice orangish-yellow color. Bit weak on the nose, but nice hoppy palate. Decent brew.
Tenaya Creek Pale Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Not bad for a beer....but it definitely lacked character to make it a legit pale. Rather watery with hints of hop flavor throughout.
Tenaya Creek Pale Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tenaya Creek Brewery;This is a pale ale? Not nearly enough hoppiness. Rather watery and flavorless but somehow it did have a nice texture.

Pacific Rim Alki Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;I would have never called this one an amber ale.

Pacific Rim Admiral ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Tap at Barcade. ABV was listed at 7.5% on the beer I had, and it was definitely more than 5.0% so I’m not sure if it’s a recipe tweak or what, but here goes anyway. Hazy deep ruby-amber beer with a thin tan head. Aroma is very malty with lots of sweet caramel and toffee notes. Slightly chewy on the palate as well. There is enough leafy hop character to restrain the sweetness a bit, but it still tends toward the cloying end of the scale. Light orange marmalade fruitiness along with a touch of cascadey type US hops. It’s an okay brew, but nothing really special either.
Pacific Rim Admiral ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Tap: Amber color, light head and lacing. Nose of light pine and spruce, clean hop and medicinal notes. Lots of c hops. Full body, nice esb, balanced and rich with the right finish. Tangy!

Lasting white head with a clear mildly carbonated gold body. Rubbing alcohol nose with a slight hops flavour. This was a weak offering.
Pacific Rim Vashon Old Stock Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Dog & Pony, RentonGolden colour. Some snappy hops, diacetyl.

Pacific Rim Vashon Old Stock Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Tap at Hop Devil: Pours a deep orange color with only a film for head. The aroma is simple with some apricot-like hop notes and some oat hints. Flavor is somewhat hopped, with a light-medium body. Has a fruity (apricot), herbal flavor with a hint of honey in the background and a grainy malt touch. Simple, sessionable.
Pacific Rim Vashon Old Stock Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Tap: Hazy orange, light head and lacing. Nose of husk and malt. The flavor is buttery with light diacetyl and pale malts. Plenty of honey and hop in the flavor. The finish is creamy and balanced but it doesn’t put it together well.
Pacific Rim Vashon Old Stock Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;"Draft at the Barking Dog in Seattle. Mild aroma leads into a flavor that is curiously peach- and mango-driven. The mouthfeel seems thin and watery to me; the flavor exceptionally mild both in the areas of malt richness and hop presence. I’m underwhelmed."
Pacific Rim Fauntleroy Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Draught, BPPNitro. Black, with light brown head. Nice chocolatey notes. Some fudginess fading to a predictably watery finish. Your basic stout.
Pacific Rim Fauntleroy Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Draft at the Pac Rim tasting room. Black. Thin orange-y tan head. Huge coffee nose. Thick and creamy on the attack. Endless waves of coffee on the mid-palate. Decent dark chocolate flavors emerge and stick around for a solid little finish.
Pacific Rim Fauntleroy Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Tap at brewery. Black with dark brown head - indication of a good stout? Oh, yeah. There is coffee and something smoky going on in this beer, but at the same time not overpowering. A great stout.
Pacific Rim Fauntleroy Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Tap: Black, light head and lacing. Nose of fresh bright and ripe roast, sweet malt and chocolate coffee notes. The flavor is smooth and malty, nice balanced mouthfeel and body. Quite tasty I thought.
Pacific Rim Fauntleroy Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Dark black, with just a hint of cherry in the center, which is kind of fitting cause that is kind of how it tasted, some rich fruitiness, and some moderate coffee roastiness, just a bit to acidic, creamy but somewhat tame. Overall not too bad.
Pacific Rim Fauntleroy Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Dark brown body with a good amount of red light appearing at the bottom of the glass. Somewhat of a fizzy mouthfeel, with a decent oak wood and coffee flavor. Overall it’s empty all over the tongue with a cola like body but lacking the sweetness. Butter defects also noted. I was not impressed.
Pacific Rim Fauntleroy Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Opaque black with a dense mocha head. Roasted malt, choco-coffee aroma. A Starbucks stout if there ever was one. The falavor is also dominated by the roasted malts. Bitterness seems to come from the roasted malts rather than the hops. Medium dry and roasy palate. Enjoyable if a bit one-dimensional.
Pacific Rim Fauntleroy Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Creamy tan head atop black body. Aroma is moderately sweet, strong coffee, some chocolate. Taste is moderately sweet, espresso, some chocolate. Creamy, medium-full body. Imbalance from too much coffee.
Pacific Rim Fauntleroy Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;This was black bodied with a too thick chocolate head. Deep, rich foocee roast characterizes the aroma and flavor. Chocolate tastes appear as well and their is a coffee bean bitterness about the finish. Surprisingly, this is brewed without coffee beans, as the brewer assured me. Quite a robust stout---esp. for the advertisied 4% alcohol content.
Pacific Rim Fauntleroy Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;A great stout, rich and flavor laden. Chocolate and coffee malt nose. Semi-sweet finish and a fair hop bite to make it perfect.

Rogue Imperial Stout;Newport, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rogue Ales;Strong chocolate-roast aroma. Sticky sweet, deep roasty-chocolate flavor that lingers. Notes: on tap at the Portland tap room , Spring '17
Rogue Imperial Stout;Newport, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rogue Ales;"From Apr 2007 This one pours from 750ml ceramic bottle(no date on bottle) an almost pitch black as I can see some slight reddish hues. The tannish head of foam is quite small and there's very little lacing. The smell has a lot going on. I get a lot of chocolate, toffee, sweet caramel, coffee, and a pretty strong nose of the more than ample alcohol. The taste is huge. Lots of chocolate and coffee with big notes of caramel hit my taste buds on my first sip. As I take further sips, I'm getting some dark fruit, plum and maybe some semi sweet cherry, but the complexity is really very tasty. The finish on it is a mix of bitterness from the coffee and a slight tartness from the dark fruit. Alcohol wise, I'm not getting a burn from it that I imagined I would judging from the smell but once it goes down, there *is* a slight warming in the stomach for me and man, is this one a thick rich brew when it comes to the body! But it's nice. Yep, this is very nice. I think I'll get another couple of bottles(here in Casper, US$11.99 each) and do a bit of aging to see how things go. Well, I've finished the 1/2 a glass I had in my New Belgium Goblet and I'm going to put this baby away until tomorrow. ""Resealing"" the bottle was a bit of a chore but I'm happy that it was as it should keep the beer fine carbonation wise...heck, it's lightly carbonated to begin with, eh? ;^) Bottom line: It's been a few years since I last had this Imperial Stout...I'm glad it showed up in town again as I think it is one fine sipping example of the style. Highly recommended! PS: I see a few people reviewed the 750s and mentioned seeing a vintage year. It's not on mine."
Rogue Imperial Stout;Newport, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rogue Ales;From old tasting notes. Brown/black color. Creamy tan head. Soft lactic roasted malt nose. Wow! Intense bittersweet roasted malt flavor. Notes of coffee, chocolate, licorice, smokiness and treacle. Very big and chewy. Lots of hop bitterness in finish to balance the intense malt flavor.
Rogue Imperial Stout;Newport, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rogue Ales;2007 Bottle. The aroma is sweet, caramel. coffee, chocolate, a little licorice, roasty. Pours almost black, with tan head mostly diminishing and excellent lacing. The taste is light bitter and a touch of sweet. The body is medium, the texture creamy, the carbonation lively and the finish long. Very Very Good!!
Rogue Imperial Stout;Newport, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rogue Ales;7 oz bottle shared, purchased at Tops Liquors in Tempe. Aroma of chocolate malt, roasted grain, coffee, light earth and light fruity esters. Similar flavor, rich, smooth and complex, hiding the ABV pretty well. Medium to full body with a lingering finish. Nice.
Rogue Imperial Stout;Newport, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rogue Ales;I will Re rate this. Having a 2002 and it is way too old. Chalk and bitter taste. Really just tastes super old.
Rogue Imperial Stout;Newport, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rogue Ales;12 oz bottle recieved from friend. Bottled date says 2004...its now 2017. This will be one of the oldest or longest aged beers I have had. Bottle also says best when aged one year. Poured into a narrow top stemmed glass. Very thin medium brown head dosnt last very long. Aroma consists primarily of dark malts. Taste is dense with heavy malts. Notes of chocolate and some coffees. A lot of hop character behind the malts. Full bodied beer with low carbonation. Low carbonation may likely be related to 12 years + aging. Over all a very strong and rich flavored beer. Has held up surprisingly well for over 12 years. I would have guessed it would have gone sour, 100% flat or stale by now.

Main Street Beer Fan Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Main Street Beer Co.;Good local Richmond, VA beer. Best to get on tap, but the local stores that carry bottles do a brisk business. Good taste, aroma and head. Bitter aftertaste that mellows as you get used to it.
Main Street Beer Fan Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Main Street Beer Co.;This reminds me of a German Helles. Super light, well topped. Light and fruity. Lemony. I'd call this a girlie beer, though.
Main Street Beer Fan Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Main Street Beer Co.;"My buddy brought this up from Richmond for me. Standard light lager, reminded me of a Schmidt''s beer. I have a feeling this beer is more expensive then a ""Schmibt-ies""."
Main Street Beer Fan Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Main Street Beer Co.;"Recently had a bottle ""fresh"" from the brewery. In no uncertain terms, and in no way am I exaggerating here: the beer was absolutely HORRID. Pours absolutely headless, very light, faint yellow, though slightly cloudy - as if Coors Light became a hefeweizen. Severe carbonation overload! Copper/metallic tartness assaults my tongue while overcarbonation kills it. Harsh bite. Has a chemically-alcoholic aftertaste. This was really an odd tasting brew, but odd in a way that I would not like to experience ever again. Have had from tap in the past and don't remember it being THIS bad, but it was never good. Extremely poorly done. I feel bad busting on Main Street, but I am only being absolutely honest. The six pack has been sitting in my fridge, and no less than 3 people who have dared sample the leftovers have told me how bad the beer was."
Main Street Beer Fan Lager;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Main Street Beer Co.;"Slightly cloudy, dark golden in color. Little head retention. Sweet-malty flavor; slightly dry finish; bread-like; by the way, ""Fan"" describes the way the streets, laden with row houses, ""fan"" out away from the city."
Holy Cow Blueberry Wheat;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Holy Cow! Casino, Cafe and Brewery;on tap holy cow, sampler: this was another one of those experimental beers. that didnt pan out. some weird extract used, not real fruit. poured clear yellow, very light head and fizzy, really carbonated, like coke. blueberry nose and thin taste, not really much wheat flavor. ive heard of this concotion before and it seems that the flavors would gel well but the beers are always sub standard??? stay away or if you want a soda try it.
Holy Cow Scotch Light;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Scottish Ale;Holy Cow! Casino, Cafe and Brewery;Maybe I just came at a bad time, but this was horrible. The best part was the appearance, deep amber to light brown, but there was nothing on the nose, and way too watery on the palate. Barely could tell it was a beer.
Holy Cow Scotch Light;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Scottish Ale;Holy Cow! Casino, Cafe and Brewery;loved it,just might have bbeen really drunk that night in vegas.............
Holy Cow Pumpkin Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Other;Holy Cow! Casino, Cafe and Brewery;I tasted this beer many years ago and now Holy Cow is gone. It was my first pumkin ale and still haunts my memory on well the pumkin taste came through. Never had that since, but now years later I am trying to recreate it.
Holy Cow Pumpkin Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Other;Holy Cow! Casino, Cafe and Brewery;on tap at the holy cow: dont know what this guy is talking about sonora brewing co, it was brewed right on premis at sahara and lv blvd., i knew the brewmaster and several people who had worked there and looked forward to this seasonal every year. this was one of my favorite pumpkin beers out there. typical nutmeg, clovey nose, orange-brown in color. a bit thin at times and sweet but pretty easy to drink with good pumpkin character. not sure if real pumpkin was used or just pumpkin pie spice. this ones gone so dont try to find it.
Holy Cow Pumpkin Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Other;Holy Cow! Casino, Cafe and Brewery;As I understand it, this beer is brewed by Sonora Brewing Co. for the “Papago Brewery” and also I believe for Holy Cow in Las Vegas. I’m not a real fan of “Pumpkin” beers, but as I sat there listening to a new local band called “Powerstump”, just banging away some great head rocking tunes, and for an “Old Coot” like me who is more inclined to Perry Como and Tony Bennett, I was totally impressed with their music, just goes to show you that you can teach and “Old Pooch” new tricks, look forward to seeing them again. Well I digress, now back to the beer. The head prodigious in size setting on a limpid amber body, creamy in its texture with a vellum like sheet of lace covering the glass. Sweet pumpkin aroma with hints of nutmeg and cinnamon, scrumptious this nose and a real treat, start is “ambrosial” pun intended, nicely malted with the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is mellow in its carbonation, the hops powerful in their spicy bite, quite dry aftertaste, and I must say this is the first “pumpkin” beer I’ve tasted that I really like, and hopefully it will be back next year as it was quite a treat.
Holy Cow Pumpkin Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Other;Holy Cow! Casino, Cafe and Brewery;Amber orange. Pumpkin pie nose. Spiced pumpkin taste........................
Holy Cow Rye Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Holy Cow! Casino, Cafe and Brewery;Hazy pale gold. Light vinegar nose is only overshadowed by the heavier vinegar flavor. A bad keg?
Main Street Beer Work Beer;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Main Street Beer Co.;"Most unique labelling of beer bottle I've seen this year. Slogan on the bottle cap exclaims ""You earned it!"". Slick packaging makes me nervous about the contents, so I sipped cautiously. With it's dark amber appearance and thin head I wasn't sure what style to expect. Aroma quickly gave it away as a pale ale. Reminds me of a Geary's English Pale Ale. Same bitterness, just no lobster on the label."
Main Street Beer Work Beer;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Main Street Beer Co.;Dark yellow with collection of collection of bubbles on top. Bitter but not in a good way. Sharp. Malted cereal in the bulk of the gulp. This tastes like a standard American lager to me, but labled as a English Pale Ale here. Not.
Main Street Beer Work Beer;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Main Street Beer Co.;RERATE: Yep, it sucks from the bottle, too. ||| Extremely uneven. Off tap, I've found to be absolutely undrinkable to adequately satisfying. Do they not know what they're doing over on Main Street? On average, a little too filling/carbonated. Almost no head. Not thin by any means and almost slightly orangish hue. Usually gives me a wicked hangover. I've never tried it out of a bottle, only off-tap. Will re-rate after a few bottle tastings, if somebody ever offers me a bottle, because I won't buy it off the shelf. If I want a 'working' man's beer, I will stick with the High Life. And by the way, I never see anybody at Main St. Beer Co. except flaming yuppies whose idea of hard 'work' is a 75-minute conference call with the marketing dept.
Main Street Beer Work Beer;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Main Street Beer Co.;This review is from memory, but here goes. I remember this ale being extremely dry, with a paper taste. Like dried wood. It's been over a year since I've had it and the only other thing of significance I can remember is the fact that it had very unique bottle caps. Try it the next time you're going through Richmond, it's pretty decent.
Main Street Beer Work Beer;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Main Street Beer Co.;"Crystal clear dark-golden color. Shines and sparkles in the light. Tastes ""bready"" and dry. A little sticky and sweet, but also kind of ""nutty,"" with a whole-grain kind of taste to it. Aroma is a little musty, although it's not too disturbing. Not extremely impressive, but after a hard day of work, any beer tastes good I suppose."
Main Street Beer Amelia Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;I quite enjoyed this beer when I had it at the Main Steer Beer Company. The appearance was nice, not much of a head, but it looked tasty. The smell was nice and refreshing. The initial taste wasn't great, but a second sip did the trick, and I found myself enjoying this beer quite a bit.
Main Street Beer Amelia Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;Golden, flat with no head. Fruity nose and a light orange-like juicey flavor. Bit of yeast there too. English Pale Ale? No way.
Main Street Beer Amelia Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;Real thin white head. Pale golden body, all different sizes of bubbles. Light, creamy and mild all around. Hints of flowers and fruits. a faint caramel malt character. Rather one dimensional initially. Does have a discernable dry hoppy character as well. Citrucy and crisp. Adry barley finish. Not too impressive, but I could drink a bunch of 'em in a pinch. so that makes it decent at least, just nothing to write home about.
Main Street Beer Amelia Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;malty nose, tiny thin head and transparent thin body, light feety maltiness, east coast yeast, no bitterness
Main Street Beer Amelia Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;"after the first taste, I almost could have sworn it was a Malt Liquor, it had that strong sweetness to it! Nice golden color. No head, lots of bubbles, but it tastes kind of flat!!?!?! It's o.k., but the sweetness is starting to get to me, where's the hops? And another thing, the bottle and packaging both indicate ""Amelia Island Brewing Company"" doesn't mention Richmond anywhere, but that makes sense, I found this at OBX, not too many miles from Richmond."
Main Street Beer Amelia Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;Undercarbonated, almost flat. Slight carmel flavor. Good beer.............
Main Street Beer Amelia Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;Good summer beer. Light, crisp, refreshing, with enough hoppiness to keep it going. Slighty nutty flavor-wise.
Main Street Beer Amelia Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;"Not bad, but not overly impressive. Refreshing, a little ""bready,"" and almost a hop aroma, but it fades. Easy-to-drink light beer."
Main Street Beer Amelia Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;Named after Amelia Island which is a barrier island just north of Jacksonville, FL. This is a fairly decent Pale Ale. Generously hopped with a nice bready/yeasty malt profile. Clean and refreshing, although slighty overcarbonated. However, the last six pack I bought had some infected bottles in it. Right down the drain!
Main Street Beer Bikini Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;"Pale orange/yellow. Zero head. Highly carbonated. Slight twinge of bitterness on back of tongue & roof of mouth; however dry aftertaste. Lifeless & Indiscernable. But you can't beat $1 drafts on a Saturday night, so drunks like me will surely drink anything!"

Main Street Beer Mango Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Main Street Beer Co.;"Draft at Main Street. Medium copper body, little head. Sweet mango nose that smacks you a bit. Flavor starts off with mango that is definitely on the sweet side. It finishes oddly enough quite bitter, almost as if the brewer at the last second thought, ""oh yeah, this is beer, not a fruit smoothie"" and threw in a pile of Chinook hops, boiling them to pure bitterness. Disjointed, didn't care for it."
Main Street Beer Mango Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Main Street Beer Co.;once again, i was prepared to despise something yet found myself pleasantly surprised. i have never been a fan of fruity beer, and i bought this on a whim because it was (chuckle) 1.99 per 4 pack at a local yokel ABC--not a big seller for the big bud boys i guess. i found the fruit aroma and taste to be immediately overwhelming, but the sip mellowed out nicely into a gen-yoo-win malty ale. after a couple of sips, i was hooked. hey mikey, i liked it! i went back the next week and bought the last two 4-packs, and alas, have seen hide nor hair of this beer again. lovely how florida vendors support local brewers, isn't it?
Main Street Beer Mango Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Main Street Beer Co.;Ive never had a mango or and orange flavored beer. I have to say that i was impressed. It wasnt one of those weak ass flavored malt beverages, but a true ale with a hint of mango flavor.
Main Street Beer Mango Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Main Street Beer Co.;You had better like mango, the smell hits you when you pop the cap. Big head, slight bitter finish, not my style but I do like mangos so I had to try. Something good for a tourist to take home and the locals to avoid
Main Street Beer Mango Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Main Street Beer Co.;"Very unique; provided you like the taste of mango, because it is right up front with this beer. Amber/orange color; crystal clear; thin,diminishing head; tasty balance between the mango flavor and malts; as expected quite sweet. The mango flavor is right on; not off or artificial at all. Good stuff!"

Main Street Beer Studley Brown Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;Dark amber with a good head, but boringly still. This has a strong nut aroma, but there's only a off-center roasted nut/wood flavor that did not appeal that well.
Main Street Beer Studley Brown Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;Rolling, lumpy, shiny, off white head. Mild brown hue. Lightly roasted nose, nutty and caramely. Solid malt profile, some earthy hops, but don't stand out well. Roastey and initially subdued hop character. A hint of dark chocolate near the finish. A little weak in body, could use some more carbonation. The finish is overly bitter, the subdued hops then pull through to overrun the malts by a longshot. The balance is not harmonious at all.
Main Street Beer Studley Brown Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;brown sugary malty aroma, auburn color with a frothy tight head, nutty, sweet, tons of hops with a pretty sketchy finish
Main Street Beer Studley Brown Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;Well-hopped ale, though I didn't particularly care for the variety. Cool label, but screw-off cap. Reddish brown with lasting raft of foam. A decent value at $4.99.
Main Street Beer Studley Brown Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;When ya call your beer studley do you really need to know what i think. It was good, as bitter as a 90 year old woman after a night of hard luck at the bingo hall. Good stuff, get my seal of approval.
Main Street Beer Studley Brown Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;Bitter, no body, there are many much better brown ales. I immeadiatly followed with a Samuel Smith Brown Ale and what a difference. I was surprised, I expected better from the comments below.
Main Street Beer Studley Brown Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;i liked the fact that there was little bitter aftertaste, but the beer seemed somewhat less hefty--not much body-- than i was expecting...i mean, with a name like studley.... not bad at all, but not outstanding either.
Main Street Beer Studley Brown Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;Aroma was a little musty, but I liked the burnt/roasty/caramel flavors. As far as head goes, maybe I got a bad bottle/batch, because the bottle I poured was WAY TOO CARBONATED. It was extremely difficult to pour and drink.
Main Street Beer Studley Brown Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Main Street Beer Co.;"A well done English Brown. Deep brown color; fairly hefty body; roasty and nutty flavor profile; hops of course very reserved; sweet side finish."

Carmel Wheat Beer;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);Bottle part of a mixed 6pack. I couldn't find any dating. It pours a clear light gold with a small head of foam. I smell wheat, little bit of caramel malt sweetness. The taste has wheat, the malt is overly sweet imho, and there's a vegetable flavour that isn't appealing to my palate. Earthy vegetables? Best that I can describe. Good enough mouthfeel. 1 bottle will do me.
Carmel Wheat Beer;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);Bottle at Pebble Beach. A little too grainy and cereal. Taste a little oxidized. Faint carbonic bite in the back. Slightly hazed old Gold. Not terrible, but not very interesting.

Carmel Wheat Beer;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);Bottle at Asilomar. It’s very hard to complain about free beer when you are chilling on the beach at Asilomar. So I won’t complain. This was perfectly drinkable, not too much banana or anything, and I’m pretty sure it had beer in it.
Carmel Wheat Beer;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);"light citrus aroma; soft, light wheat base with mild citrus hop notes; much more of an American style wheat - no banana or clove notes typical of a hefeweizen"
Carmel Wheat Beer;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);Keg at A.W.Shucks, Carmel, 30/04/14. Lightly hazed golden orange with a moderate white swirl and edgework. Nose is citric rinds, lemon, ornage peel, straw. Taste is pretty bland, citric forward, grass, light spice, metallic rinse.

Hertog Jan Grand Prestige;Arcen, Netherlands;Quadrupel / Abt;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Black with a small head. Malty but not a lot of body considering its strength. Some presence of alcohol but not as much as you would expect for its strength. Definitely a wolf in sheep's clothing.

I love ""Quardrupel"" beers and i give a try to this because has this style and also some good ratings but in the end i get something different that i'm used to get from this style.. First of all the aroma is the ordinary for that style.. Lot of caramel and chocolate in there. Also remind me little the aroma of ""Het Anker gouden carolus imperial dark"".. But the taste was little weird.. I'm used to get some sweet taste from ""Quad"" beers but this has a lot sour taste inside and less sweetness.. Also the alcohol is very noticeable and hit you in the palate.. And i get very dry taste in my mouth.. Overall is ok beer.. Has some ""Quad"" character but can't touch the stardards of the good and classic beers on that style.."

Hertog Jan Oud Bruin;Arcen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Overgezet van Untappd. Het is een helder donkerbruin bier met weinig schuim. Het heeft een moutige wat karamel achtige geur en smaak.
Hertog Jan Oud Bruin;Arcen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Notities gevonden van meer dan 20 jaar geleden. Ik kan me nog wel herinneren dat ik het toen wel aangenaam vond, mits koud geserveerd. Anno nu zou ik er hoogstwaarschijnlijk niet zo snel meer aan beginnen omdat oud bruin bij mij onder de categorie: zoete futloze pulp valt. Uiterlijk: bruin bier met redelijk wat koolzuur en redelijke schuimkraag voorzien van bruine vlokjes. Smaak en geur komen overeen: karamel, gebrande mout en een toffeezoetje.
Hertog Jan Oud Bruin;Arcen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);"Typical Dutch oud bruin, not to be confused with the totally different Flemish oud bruin style; close to the equally mass-produced Dommelsch Oud Bruin in terms of appearance, aroma and taste, but a bit less sweet and a bit more metallic. Serves its purpose as a daily low alcoholic, I guess."
Hertog Jan Oud Bruin;Arcen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);"Deep red brown, thin frothy tan head; sweet malty nose, roasted, brown sugar, syrupy, bread; very sweet, sugar; thin texture, watery mouthfeel, light body; sweet roasted finish"
Hertog Jan Oud Bruin;Arcen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Bottle: And here’s another Dutch sweet beer, rather go for the Flamish Oud Bruin. A medium off white to light tan head on top of a ruby brown colored beer. Smell sweets, some malts and darker fruits. Taste is also sweet, brown sugars, sweet darker fruits and sweet malts. All these Dutch Oud Bruins’ seem to taste so much like eachother, not interesting and just too sweet.
Hertog Jan Oud Bruin;Arcen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Dark brown, thin head, very sweet one with hinds of cola and candy, almost no spices and no beer hinds. had better oud bruin.
Hertog Jan Oud Bruin;Arcen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Ruby body with smallish head. Sweet nose. Sweet flavour, more than usual perhaps due to low ABV. Light. Not my thing.
Hertog Jan Oud Bruin;Arcen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);"This was something totally new for me. Sort of a low alcohol porter or bock. Not too bad, but very sweet. Actually quite similar to finnish ""kotikalja"", could be translated as homebrew. I would have this with a meat soup when you still need to drive."
Hertog Jan Oud Bruin;Arcen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Oh my god, really not a great beer, tasted it once and never again! Have thrown away. Much too sweet. In one word: disgusting!
Hertog Jan Oud Bruin;Arcen, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);28 May 2005 - Big malt aroma and damn sweet. Clear brown-red colour poor head and lacing. Lots of caramel and too sweet given that it lacks some complexity. Sweet lingering malt finish, but too sweet.
Hertog Jan Winterbier;Arcen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);bottle. Golden colour, tall white head. Full-bodied, malty with a touch of honey, vanilla and gingerbread., and a special flavour I cannot point my finger on. Loved it.
Hertog Jan Winterbier;Arcen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Clear yellow with a white top. Wet dog, sweet malty aroma. Over medium sweet and mildly bitter. Medium body with average carbonation. Hm, not great. Bit one dimensional.

Sweet grainy perfume aroma. Sweet taste with an even sweeter finish. Typical macro blond Belgina strong ale. Expected a bit more from a Hertog Jan beer to be honest, even has some alcohol burn. Didn't even manage to finish it.
Hertog Jan Winterbier;Arcen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Thanks to Erzengel for sharing! Bottle looks simple but good. Beer in the glass zippy, small head. Starts strong, malty, a bit alcoholic. Some sharp soapy notes. Light spicy. Finish still alcoholic, intense malty. Okay.
Hertog Jan Winterbier;Arcen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Smooth fresh fruity nose. Beginning with banana and dry hops.

Hertog Jan Winterbier;Arcen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Is niet verkeerd maar is toch wat aan de “dunne” kant .Van een winterbier verwacht ik eigelijk dat hij zwaarder en voller is . En dat is deze niet .
Hertog Jan Winterbier;Arcen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Bottle from Albert Heijn supermarket in Gorinchem, The Netherlands. The beer is clear golden colored and has a small, little unstable white foam, with average carbonation. The aroma is malty and spicy, with notes of caramel, yeast, vanilla, bananas, little citrus, cloves and other spices. The taste is medium to full bodied and malty sweet with notes of caramel, bananas, fruits, honey and goes to light bitter with yeast and spices. The finish is light bitter, little alcoholic and short. Not a winterbier in my opinion. Misses alcohol warmth and also dark malts.
Hertog Jan Winterbier;Arcen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Jongens en dames uiteraard dit is gewoon een trippel die onder de naam winterbier verkocht wordt. Ah maar ik zie nu dat de stijl Belgian Ale is dat verklaard een hoop. Maar dat is dus net niet wat ik van een winterbiertje verwacht. Maakt het beoordelen ook meteen een stuk moeilijker. Zoetig honing smaak. Redelijke zoete licht medium moutige geur. Klein bittertje Overall voldoende om het boven het gemiddelde te doen uitsteken. Maar winterbier??? Nee als het niet op het etiket stond had ik daar nooit aan gedacht. Hertog Jan het zeker geen verkeerde Belgian Ale maar maak volgende keer een winterbier dat de lading van de naam dekt. Proefglas
Hertog Jan Winterbier;Arcen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);"Clear golden pour with small white head, retaining well. Sweet, malty and spicy aroma; not very special. Taste same: medium sweet and spicy. Nice but easy winter beer."

Hertog Jan Bockbier;Arcen, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);0.3l bottle. Clear ruby red body with basicaply no head. Aroma of caramel, burnt sugar and a bit of orange zest. Taste of toast, caramel with a bit of orange zest and a tiny bit of cocoa. The toasted/burnt character is a bit overdone. I had better examples of this style.

Hertog Jan Bockbier;Arcen, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Bottle thanks to kapusul. Pours reddish amber, no head. Grainy, syruppy malt aroma. Taste is caramel, cough syrup, bread and toffee. Not much remains except some sticky malts. Not the best. Too much cough syrup flavor for me. Not so enjoyable.

Hertog Jan Meibock;Arcen, Netherlands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);On tap at Arendsnest. Golden body, nice head. Some malts but hoppy too. Quite sweet with fruits in the taste and the finish.
Hertog Jan Meibock;Arcen, Netherlands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);This must have been revived for the spring season 2008 as a draught beer as it was on sale in ’t Arendsnest in Amsterdam in May. Not the most interesting spring bok on sale at that time, probably cold fermented. A clear winy golden colour with a creamy white head, and a restrained sweetish and spicy slightly Germanic hoppy aroma. Palate was malty, slightly grapy and gunpowdery with a bit of hops and some odd fruity flavours that suggested it might be about to go off. A smooth malty finish had banana esters and a winy note.
Hertog Jan Meibock;Arcen, Netherlands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);A Mes rate: Bottle from Lowlander I think. Has one of the best aromas for a bock beer I have tried so far. Smells like something much more serious. Almost like a chunky quad. Is this right? Complex fruit, cream, and lashings of alcohol. A smell that is as intoxicating as it is divine. I could smell this all day. Sadly the drink itself does not quite live up to the initial promise. Lots of bock characteristics but quite blondish too. All the flavours come through at the finish leaving you with anassault of apple and liquorice and alcohol that does not seem to know what it is doing. That said it went down ok, it’s just not anything outstanding. But OH MY GOD that smell!!! I could get high off it.
Hertog Jan Meibock;Arcen, Netherlands;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Bottle. Creamy white good mostly lasting head. Yellow colour. Nice hoppy aroma. Average finish. And very oily palate.

Brewsters Bighorn Bitter;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;rerate June 21 ’10 - pour was half asses like usual so I guess the last pint I had was a one off in terms of looks. Taste is still ok but of course needs work. So damn gassy and it just cost me 7$ for this - are you kidding me? I’d say fuck this place forever but find me anoher place in he city that brews anything drinkable. Well.… easily the best looking Brewsters beer I’ve had. One finger deep crown, thick and light tan on light copper brew. The aroma really needs some warming to come out. Caramel, grainy bread, lots of fruit. Taste wise this is very drinkable. Caramel, bread, medium hoppy spice (for brewsters), nice fruit. It’s too gassy even after half a pint. It’s on the edge for the style but it’s tasty and drinkable. A bit thin on some sips but overall pretty good.
Brewsters Bighorn Bitter;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Not too bad. Aroma is hoppy, sweet malts and caramels.

Taste of roasted malts, unsweetened chocolate and a hint of coffee. Low carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. Not bad.
Brewsters Shaughnessy Stout;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Brewsters Irish stout is a typical, if not exactly creative loaf in a glass. It’s thick, creamy, and not too bitter, but not all that memorable as good guinness approximationa are. It’s finish doesn’t, almost as if it’s missing something that could make it a great beer. Bottom line this beer is like a fake accent, nice as long you ignore the way it slips from time to time.
Brewsters Shaughnessy Stout;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Not great, but the pint I was given was at least not unpleasant. Near black, 3/4 inch of off white head. Roast, dry. A touch of cooked vegetable in there. Okay.
Brewsters Shaughnessy Stout;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Originally reviewed Mar. 1, 2007: got the draught and head showed super thin to non-existent. what head there was, was light tan colour i'm guessing. as i was drinking, it showed light roping with spotty lacing at best. aroma reflected coffee beans. perhaps as good as safeway brand or western family might be. the taste is like as if i was drinking bitter water. the aftertaste is again, bitter, and very undesirable. it lingers. if i had a choice of stouts to choose from at this place, i wouldn't be choosing this one i'd guess.

Caramel nose with hints of mustard and bordeaux. Odd but nothing to stick your nose up at. Nut dominant taste with a malty background. A strong entrance of tap water kicks in and certainly doesn’t add to the quality of this one. Fairly quiet finish.

Brewsters Blue Monk Barley Wine;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;I never thought I would give a Brewster's beer this high of a rating. All their beer is shit....except this one. At least that I've tried. Anyway lots of great bourbon and caramel notes in the aromas and flavours along with vanilla and pipe tobacco. Delicious.
Brewsters Blue Monk Barley Wine;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;So, this actually makes me all the more disappointed in Brewsters other beers.

Brewsters Blue Monk Barley Wine;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Appearance: clear medium amber with one fat finger of rocky light beige head diminishing gradually to a thin skim, moderate lacing. (4/5) Aroma: orange peel, bready caramel malt, dark fruit, resin. (6/10) Taste: moderate-high sweet, moderate-high bitter. (7/10) Palate: medium-full slightly slick body, soft carbonation, lingering bitter and warming finish. (4/5) A decent implementation of the style: the double-digit alcohol is definitely present, but not solventy or excessively hot, and there are pleasant citrus, dark fruit, and hop notes present. I suspect the year’s cellaring has helped mellow this out, and in any case certainly hasn’t hurt. I’m interested to see how the bourbon barrel-aged version of this compares. (14/20)
Brewsters Blue Monk Barley Wine;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Bomber pour. Cloudy copper brown pour.

Flavour is strong malt and nut wit vague hints of yeast on the end. Medium finish. Really good and the abv is very well hidden, be sure not to drive after a bomber of this one."

Brewsters Christmas Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;My waitress told me this is brewed with ’cinnamon, nutmeg and something else’. Hazy and a deep iatnge going red is as best as I can do in the lighting here. Ok white cap - another nice pour. A sneak taste revealed that this is not disgusting - just the opposite. Soft aromas of nutmeg, lots of honey, caramel, light spice, maybe cinnamon, nice soothing aroma without a stupid load of strong spices. Decent taste and standard for a Xmas spiced beer but thankfully less powerful. Toasty malts, numeg, cinnamon, a bit of sweetness. Drinkable seasonal brew.

Had copious amounts of espresso notes in the beer such that I can’t get through them with my measly palate to find the underlying beer.

Label is standard Brewsters seasonal label with a ""P"" written in marker on it. I seem to remember ""Kona"" in the title, hoping this is the same beer. Pours deep brown, winey red highlights.

Flavour begins with a bit of sweet dark chocolate, black coffee, light hops and roasty notes in the finish. Body somewhat light, as is level of carbonation. Nice effort from Brewsters."

Gearys Hampshire Special (HSA) Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Strong Ale - English;D.L. Gearys Brewing Co.;From Dec 2007 I got this bottle in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! This pours from 12oz bottle a clear medium gold with a 2 finger head of foam. The smell is very malty and very nice. I also get a fruity nose that makes it a pleasure to sniff. The taste has big caramel malt, dark fruit, some grain, and a surprisingly ample but not overpowering hop presence in the background that adds just the right touch to somewhat balance it out but to tell you the truth, I'm enjoying the hell out of the malt. Nice bit of bready notes here as well and the alcohol is completely hidden, asaic. Lovely drop! It has a fairly thick mouthfeel(yeah!), the carbonation is medium light, and it finishes malty semi sweet. Again...lovely drop! Oh, and the foam hangs around like forever. I'm *really* impressed with this English Strong Ale and I'd seek it out again.

Unser Bier Blond;Basel, Switzerland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Unser Bier;Review: 33cl bottle of Unser Bier Naturblond: ABV: 5% On pour I get a very nice looking yellow colour and a big frothy white head which settles nicely. A good bit of carbonation making it all look pretty good...... Very strong on the nose, I get a strong fruity aroma which is very enticing, very nice and sweet. Also some malts present in the smell......... On taste It is a slow burning beer, more fun to relax and enjoy the tastes of the fruit and sweet malts, not a session beer anyway Very tasty, nice pleasant mouthfuls, a very filling beer. I find it very hoppy, possibly a bit too hoppy, but is manageable. Ok, nice and tasty, good enough beer, not bad, not terribly complex, but nice all the same.
Unser Bier Blond;Basel, Switzerland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Unser Bier;Tap at tibits Basel. Pours golden with the slightest hint of haze, but almost no foam. I assume that?s the tap that they use. Aroma is dominated by light malts with some grassy hops, not too shy altogether. Taste of the medium body is lightly sweet with some hop flavours waving from afar, as if to show they were actually used, but not taking the stage. Round and pretty smooth experience until there. A bit flat, maybe. Bitterness is more notable on the palate. Speaking of it, the palate is an undecided mix of the body leasing into it, some hops that finally want to be noted, the bitterness finally kicking in and the carbonation deciding it doesn?t exist anymore. Needs more harmony there. All in all nothing outstanding, with an aroma and a taste which work and a palate that disappoints.
Unser Bier Blond;Basel, Switzerland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Unser Bier;On tap at brewery. Golden body with slight head. Grassy nose. Taste is hoppy, floral, toasty. Not overly complex. Decent.
Unser Bier Blond;Basel, Switzerland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Unser Bier;Appearance: Pale yellow golden, clear. Small, fizzy white head. Aroma: Malt, slight hops. Standard.

Unser Bier Weihnachtsbier (-2008);Basel, Switzerland;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Unser Bier;Bottled 50cl. It pours a beautiful, slightly hazy deep golden beer with a lovely, nicely lasting creamy whitish head. The nose is extremely strange and rather interesting. Cinnamon, leather, cereals and chicken with some washing-up liquid. Burnt plastic and glue showing up as well. Indeed, a very strange nose. The taste is a catastrophy.... Chicken and burnt plastic flavors. Just a hint of cinnamon. Grainy, weird and extremely artificial. The finish is of washing-up liquid. This beer somehow really doesn’t work out with me.
Unser Bier Weihnachtsbier (-2008);Basel, Switzerland;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Unser Bier;"Nice gold color; generous head. Malt and light rosemary aroma. Round, quite sweet in the front, quite malty, corn, ending with a better bitterness and rosemary touch. Original."

Honeyish floral and citric aroma. Light body, dry mouthfeel. Quite citric entry, almost tilting into the laundry detergent, herbal notes, orangepeel, pineapple. Light on the strawlike malt.

Wädi-Brau-Huus Wädenswiler Ur-Pils;Wädenswil, Switzerland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wädi-Brau-Huus;***** SWISS BEER # 100 ***** bottle, herzlichen Dank Allen! Slightly hazy golden colour with a rocky creamy white head, very persistent. Lovely hopy nose with hints of citrus fruit. Clean and crisp hop flavours dominate the beer, with hints of lemon, lime and grapefruit. Pleasantly ydeasty with a solid underlying malty base. A delicious Pils.
Wädi-Brau-Huus Wädenswiler Ur-Pils;Wädenswil, Switzerland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wädi-Brau-Huus;Bottled 33cl. 5.1 ABV. It pours a surprisingly murky golden beer with a quick diminishing initially tall white head. The aroma is rather pleasant , nicely hoppy, grassy and fruity. Quite inviting with pineapple, yeast, grapefruit, peach, bread crust, light grain, apricot, arabic gum and elderflower appearing. Unfortunately faintly sulphury. Impressive flavor with a lot of aromatic hop showing up. Hints of elderflower, white bread, peach, apricot, arabic gum and grapefruit. Medium bodied. Subtle carbonation. Good bitterness. Mediocre lacework. One deficit: slightly grainy and soapy with hints of breakfast cereals (sugar puffs). Extremely refreshing. Lovely long dry hoppy finish which is reminiscent of elderflower and honey. A very good beer from this brewery I really like.
Wädi-Brau-Huus Wädenswiler Ur-Pils;Wädenswil, Switzerland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Wädi-Brau-Huus;"especially labelled ""WM-Bier 2006"" but this is probably the same recipe - pours a hazy blond-orange colour under a very foamy, white head; the aroma is yeasty with grapefruity and herbal notes; medium- to full-bodied, astringeant and with a solid bitterness; moderately dry and long hoppy flowery finish - much better that it was in my memory"
Warteck Lager;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlösschen (Carlsberg);Having one in Basel/Switzerland just next to the Rhine river.

Warteck Lager;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlösschen (Carlsberg);Review: 33cl bottle of Warteck Lager: ABV: 4.8% vol Bought it in a ten pack as I couldn’t get any singles in the shop. Clever marketing? Green bottle, screw top, simple but effective logo, I like it. On appearance, it was a very fizzy beer, that produced a nice crystal clear golden yellow colour, but once it all settled down we are left with a very flat beer with no head at all. very flat, very disappointing considering the initial lively carbonation. The smell is nice enough of what you can get, a lagery kind of aroma but also a bit like a sweet perfume, must be the grains! Not much smell overall though. Taste is nice enough, the initial mouthful feels good. Nice maltiness there. A light lager taste that is fine. It is an Ok beer, smooth and decent to drink but no great outstanding tastes that are going to set the world alight. It is a very light tasting lager. Smooth, easy to drink, but boring and bland, even for a lager Overall, I won’t be drinking again I don’t think!
Warteck Lager;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlösschen (Carlsberg);Hoppy bitterness, little sweetness. Simple, slightly metallic, just drinkable and no need to repeat.
Warteck Lager;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlösschen (Carlsberg);From old tasting notes. Bright medium gold color. Thick creamy white head. Fresh malt/hop aroma. Flavorful sweet toasted maltiness upfront. Underlying hoppiness throughout. Well balanced. Very drinkable.
Warteck Lager;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlösschen (Carlsberg);Tap at a bar in Basel. No outstanding tastes as far as pale lagers go, but also no bad ones. Malt sweetness is decent, with a lively carbonation to give a counterweight. A bit oily on the palate, but altogether round and smooth. Well done for a lager.
Warteck Lager;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlösschen (Carlsberg);A very light lager with sweet notes and rare hops. Still well brewed and thirstquencher for a summer day or lawnmowing.

Light body and good carbonation. Grassy aftertaste. Medium drinkability. Not bad

Molson Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Another quality Ice beer. Molson Ice seems just the slightest bit more complex than some of the other Ice brews. Very enjoyable. Cheers.
Molson Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Darker golden with a medium head. Notes are skunk, grain alcohol, malt, and toast. Tastes a little metallic as well. Thin and gross.
Molson Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Thin white head, pale straw color. Aroma of sweet grain. Mouthfeel is light and frothy. Flavor is too heavy on the sweetness, somewhat cloying with little to no hop balance. Overall: I occasionally enjoy an Ice beer, but I will not be trying this one again.
Molson Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Aroma and flavor is malts/corn, mild fruit, not much really in the middle and a slightly beery/mildly alcoholic finish.
Molson Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"24 ounce can into lager glass, best before 8/20/2018. Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and light herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity/metallic aromas, but not overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and light herbal/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Mildly increasing warmth of alcohol through the glass. Overall this is a pretty good pale adjunct lager style. All around nice robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, and pretty refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and not watery. Other than the slightly off aromas, this was really tasty. Very clean barley/grain flavors and solid earthy hop balance. Not overdone on adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example. Pretty close to the regular, but more flavorful and fuller mouthfeel as expected."
Molson Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);24 fl.oz. can. A clear golden coloured beer with a white head. Aroma and flavour of malt, citrus, straw, hops and with a mild bitter finish.
Molson Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Not very good. One of the cheapest beers around here in the single coolers.
Molson Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle. Pours pale yellow with small off-white head. Aromas of grain and corn. Single note sweet flavor. Thin bodied. Pretty meh.
Molson Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);It's a smooth light in color beer. A Canadian beer that is made in Texas!!! Ice brewed. Great for Knocking a few back on a summer evening sitting on the porch ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Molson Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);bottle @ Liquor Barn / Danville KY --- Clear medium amber, white head that drops quickly to the rim, strings of lace. Taste is malt with an adjunct, medium fizz, and slight bittering. Simple, similar to most other big brewery offerings.
Molson Brador;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);When I would bartend in Ottawa in the early 80's we sold lots of it. Reminds me of WW 2 Quebicous veterans and plain end cigarettes. If you could get shot with hot steel through the intestines and go back to the field a couple of months later this is the beer for you.
Molson Brador;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I drank this beer above all others when I could afford it in the 80's! Only available in eastern Canada. :( So smooth and full bodied. Sure miss it!
Molson Brador;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bright yellow gold color. Dense white head. Mixed nose of sour malt and light hops. Flavor is a mirror of the nose with a clean bitter hop finish an aftertaste.
Molson Brador;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Holy old school!! This shit has been around forever-- sexy new label though. Medium gold, white head that recedes rather quickly. Tinny sweet malts, a touch of apple, sweet and corny.

Molson Brador;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"okay so had this a long time ago a different yr. Don;t normaly see this around but some beer stores have 12pack’s. I drank a bunch but couldn;t do all 12. To me it tasted like a combo of apple juice & pee back when I had it. Pass."
Molson Brador;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Wow, no rating from me on this yet? A staple of trips over the border many years ago, was always smooth and fresh and potent. Not much flavor, silky body. A bit of an overstatement on the high alcohol content if it is truly 6%. Seemed like a lot at the time.
Molson Brador;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a medium golden with a small white head. Aroma of corn and alcohol. Taste of the same. Had this back in the late 80’s when it was distributed to the U.S.A. Not a bad tasting malt liquor but I didn’t consider it back then.

Cugino Beer;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;12oz bottle(8/02)-Contract brewed by Two Brothers. A golden body with a decent head and an aroma of grains. Taste of grains and nothing. Another pale lager with nothing to write home about.
Cugino Beer;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Bottled. Pours a medium golden color. Aroma is somewhat sweet and grainy. Kind of sour and acidic as well. Flavor is sour and malty. Almost a creamy mouthfeel. Sour and bitter finish. Not really very good.
Cugino Beer;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;"found this at some store in wisconsin once on a camping trip: $2 for a 6pack. figured, why not, right? ratebeer.com offers four good reasons why not: aroma, appearance, flavor, and palate. my friends and i spent the whole first beer trying to figure out what it tasted like. we decided ""pistachios"" or some other inappropriate nut. then i gave the other 5 bottles away to some homeless guy who was sleeping on our campsite when we had arrived. his name was mark. this beer’s named Cugino. I reckon i’ll see them both in hell."
Cugino Beer;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Had this one bottled. I got it in North Aurora, Illinois, if that means anything to anybody. I have no idea where Cugino is brewed -- maybe Huber makes it? Anyways, a decent lager, corny taste, thin watery head and mouthfeel. Not much going on here.
Cugino Beer;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;This is darker than their light beer, almost gold with the same white head as their light and big carbonation. This is worse than their light beer. It is offensive...drain pour. No need to use your liver as a sieve for this one.
Cugino Beer;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;The bottle says this was brewed in Monroe Wisconsin, Huber country. Anyone live near Fermi labs who can see if this place really exists in Batavia? It’s really not worth the effort. It’s pretty sweet and grainy for my tastes with little hopping. Wherever it’s from, I don’t want any more.
Cugino Beer;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Not a lot to sneze at. Golden in color, decent head. Slightly sweet- corn? Claims to be America's first Italian beer? What the heck does that mean?
Cugino Beer;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Another new micro-brewery and another micro American standard. Interesting and well done with a notable American hop finish. Better than macro surely but us nuts are waiting for you to expand your offerings. We hate to pay micro $ for standard. Best of luck, your efforts are appreciated.
Cugino Light;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;12oz bottle(8/02)-Brewed by Two Brothers-A light golden body with a decent head and an aroma of any typical lager. Taste light with a little of a funky taste. Not the worst I’ve had.
Cugino Light;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;"Bottle from the sale rack at Foremost, Oak Forest. I suspect I’m sampling from the same batch as the previous raters, cause this bottle may be pretty aged. It opens with a surprisingly sweet smell, first fruity then a bit winey. Pours way too dark for a light beer. Not quite cloudy, but there are a few floaties visible. Just a light scum of bubbles. Taste is a little less interesting. Just a light, oxidized malt with some corn sweetener. Thin, watery texture. Geez, and I thought when I smelled it they might have added a grape tannin or something to make it really ""Italian."" But it’s just olf. I will try a fresh one sometimes. Meantime, I notice our listing for Cugino Brewing’s web site just returns a placeholder search page. If this stuff is still being brewed, it’s not controlled from Batavia, anymore."
Cugino Light;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;"I thought this was from Italy but, alas, I’ve now tried yet another beer from Illinois. Golden/amber with a little sediment and a tiny head. Musty aroma with burnt grain, slight caramel, coins and DMS lurking beneath. A ""dirty"" taste, bittersweet, with slight spiciness and mild sourness at the end. Foremost Liquors, Oak Forest, IL"
Cugino Light;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Dark yellow with a short-lived big-bubbled head and a corny sweet aroma - - - this is what I look for to entice me into drinking a beer. It’s light bodied with a light sweet corn & malt taste with a slightly crisp finish. My first and last. Foremost Liquors, Oak Forest, IL
Cugino Light;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Big bubbles rise from a surprisingly darker than straw-colored beer with a fat-bubbled, white head. Aroma is lager ferment sulphur and a toasty grain. The beer shows flavor of a nice pale lager for 2 seconds then the CO2 overwhelms the delicate body. Almost ethereal with a damp, musty basement finish.
Cugino Light;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;"A descent light brew, nothing special. Carbonation, watery, ""light beery"" not bad."
Cugino Light;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Bright hoppish type of macrobrew nose. Very light color with micro-bubbles. Very thin and watery. The nose is more sweet than bitter. Not bad for a light beer.
Cugino Light;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Light head disappears quickly. Light colored light bodied. A sweet and smokey aroma. Clean flavor, no bite. A good lawn mower beer.
Cugino Light;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Two Brothers Brewing Company;What? Bottle conditioning of a light beer? Interesting show in my pilsener glass of the yeast bouying and sounding. Otherwise, looks nice with a sweet and lightly smokey hop aroma. Crisp and and fresh tasting and biteless. A bit wet. Gino and Vito done good. Would I drink this again? Fughettaboutit!!
Bulmers (Magners Original Irish) Cider;Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland;Apple Cider;Bulmers Ireland (C&C Group);12 oz. bottle poured to a fest chalice at home displaying a clear & bright, orangey/gold color, a layer of soft white froth that quickly reduced to a persistent, bubbly ring, with light dots & dashes of lacing. The nose was expressive apple, skins, & core, with a touch of ripeness, and slight hints of barrel & white wine. Light to medium bodied, with modest spritz to the effervescence, the taste was similar, not overly sweet or tart, and somewhat mellow like apple juice, thus making it quite drinkable, but lacking in familiar, cider-like pizzazz.
Bulmers (Magners Original Irish) Cider;Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland;Apple Cider;Bulmers Ireland (C&C Group);This is a backlog rating from 2012 from a bottle, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are sweet, lightly tart apples, no reason to have again.
Bulmers (Magners Original Irish) Cider;Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland;Apple Cider;Bulmers Ireland (C&C Group);Sweet apple smell. Pours a lovely, clear gold. Sweet apple taste with a dry finish.
Bulmers (Magners Original Irish) Cider;Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland;Apple Cider;Bulmers Ireland (C&C Group);50cl can. Pours pinkish with quickly fading white foam. Aroma is apple and alcohol. Body is average, with good carbonation. Taste is fairly sweet but excessive. Finish is average.
Bulmers (Magners Original Irish) Cider;Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland;Apple Cider;Bulmers Ireland (C&C Group);Bottle at Thyme Restaurant in the Premier Inn in Colchester. Wouldn't normally go near a hotel restaurant, but was staying there with elderly in-laws who didn't feel up to going anywhere further so was stuck here. The restaurant was as dire as I'd expected, but at least I managed to get this unexpected rate (I was surprised that I hadn't already rated it). It's a disturbingly artificial orange colour. It tastes of sweet stewed apple and cheap apple juice. There's a pleasant hint of vanilla but a touch of vomit. It's not great, but it's better than the worst of the macro ciders.
Portsmouth Bahn Yahd Pale Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Pale Ale - English;Portsmouth Brewery;NERAX '02 Hazy in appearnce,aroma of grass and citrus.Dry finish for such a pale ale.
Portsmouth Bahn Yahd Pale Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Pale Ale - English;Portsmouth Brewery;Washed out autumn leave orange. Sticky, off white foam. Slow but steady carbonation. Aroma of grass, light citrus and faint malts. Soft and mild with a playful crispness. Citric hops and a caramel toastyness start it out. Grassy bitterness and a touch of crystal sweetness. Medium body. Turns grassier and less citric as it warms. Alcohol is tasted as well, which is strange for such a low ABV brew. Finishes bitterly grassy and a touch spicy. Seems to be missing something, besides an R or two.

Portsmouth Bahn Yahd Pale Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Pale Ale - English;Portsmouth Brewery;"English-style Bitter with small head and relatively low carbonation. Has a real ""homebrewed"" earthiness to it. Soft, somewhat rich, smooth and creamy. Def easy to drink as a session beer. Has kind of a slippery mouthfeel, if that makes sense. Decent dose of hops in the back end, but leaves behind a curious bitterness. Willamette seems to come through just fine, but it was difficult to discern the Cascade hops."

Pours a cloudy, rusty orange with a thin off-white head on top. Retention is lacking. No lace left behind. Plenty of carbonation rising through. The nose is pretty underwhelming. Some mild grains, light syrupy-sweetness, and some floral tones. Good crisp, clean body. Moderate carbonation on the tongue. This beer starts out a bit sweet with some honey notes. There’s some mild bitterness, but pretty much lacking there. My favorite part is the finish. There’s a nice bready taste that is very pleasant. All-in-all, this is a pretty tame, average APA. I’ve had better, but I wouldn’t turn this one down."
Lamar Street Organic Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);Bonus for organic, but this just wasn’t grabbing me. In the spectrum of average pale ales this was on the lower end. Serving: Bottle
Lamar Street Organic Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);An average ale. Really nothing too special. The taste you can tell its well crafted. Quality malts. Crispness and nice hops Overall good but nothing great.
Lamar Street Organic Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);Dark amber color with no head. Aroma of apples, raisins. Maybe some spices. A bit of funk, but otherwise no hint of hops. Flavor is very bland. I’m not sure what they were trying for here, but it didn’t work.
Lamar Street Organic Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);A golden brown beer with a small head. The aroma was grainy, & the taste was somewhat bready,very basic less than run of the mill APA.
Lamar Street Organic Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);12 oz. bottle that I received as a gift. Pours a hazy amber with a moderate linen white head that lasted through the first quarter of the glass and left partial lace. There is really not all that much happening in the aroma department with this beer other than perhaps a few very subtle wisps of malt. The flavor is malt, somewhat grainy, with just a bit of apple. Mouthfeel is slightly slick with a somewhat thin body. Very mild hoppy finish. Not something I would look to revisit.
Lamar Street Organic Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);Bottle as shown. Pours a cloudy orange copper with a small frothy white head that leaves decent spotty lacing. The aroma is a fruity malt with caramel and coriander. Thin mouthfeel with a bready malt and caramel with a nice crisp finish. Easy to drink a good pale ale from Goose Island.
Lamar Street Organic Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);no hops whatsoever, just pale malt. not bad, but not good either. i’d be happier with something i know is good. but at least i get to add another tick to the tally. Bottle at whole foods, miami beach.
Lamar Street Organic Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);Overly sweet. Nice crisp hop profile that hints at some grassy notes, but overall the malt in this one is too syrupy. Pours cloudy copper with white head.
Lamar Street Organic Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);Brewed from organic ingredients by Goose Island for Whole Foods, and sold at a low price. Aroma is lightly sweet and hoppy with a whiff of skank. A light/medium weight ale that tastes like a malty lager, with a bit of citrus and pine. A good brew, and not a bad deal at all.
Lamar Street Golden Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);A sweet aroma with a trace of brown sugar. It’s a very pretty copper color with a large, lasting off white head that laces the glass. It has a smooth flavor with slight traces of hops, a little orange, and barley. Smooth on the palate- a very nice beer! Pairs well with pasta and veggies with garlic/alfredo sauce! :) Actually gets better as it warms-- smoother palate.
Lamar Street Golden Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);"Very light flowery aroma with a bit of malt. Slightly murky amber gold color (could it be bc, being from Goose Island?), with virtually non-existent white head. First swig really grabs the mouth; it is full bodied. The taste is lightly flowery, there’s light malt, and the finish is bitter on the edges of the tongue and somewhat on the top(?). Except for the surprising initial impact it’s not particulary unique. However, it is very drinkable - thanks no doubt to Goose Island."
Lamar Street Golden Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);"Wow, can't believe I'm only the third person to have this. Didn't realize it was this ""rare"". Came as a sample bottle from a distributor and I had this as the fifth and final bottle from the set. Pours golden brown with a medium white head. The nose is perfumy like it's brother but has some hints of sweetened malt. The taste is also perfumy and somewhat thick and chalky. It's sort of cumbersome and has little redeeming qualities. My friend Vince and I rather disliked this beer. It is OK, but nothing I'd drink more than a glass of in an evening. We split a bottle, so that's fine. Mouthfeel was chalky as previously described. Finish was hoppy and perfumy. Worth trying I guess, but nothing to brag about."
Lamar Street Golden Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);Medium Gold color, medium head. A medium bodied ale, malty and slightly sweet. Smooth taste. Not very hoppy. Nice flavor. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is slightly malty. Nice mild tasting beer.
Lamar Street Golden Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);Excellent golden hue, good foam and retention. Very well balanced and the aroma is a light blend of carmel, cocoa, bushy hops, and fruit.
Wychwood Old Devil;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);This beer pours an interesting brown colour that is slightly transparent (You can ’see’ your hand on the other side through the beer). The head is weak, fluffy, and tannish in colour. The flavour is slightly sweet, with malt up front, and a slight sour tinge on the tongue.
Wychwood Old Devil;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);First tasted this in the Last Post, Paisley (JDW) in October 1999. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear garnet redf in colour with a thick white creamy head. Distinct note of pineapple in the sweet aroma. Thin but creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a fiery maltloaf base with syrupy pineapple, cherry, redcurrant and a hint of butterscotch. Slight spicy note in the bitter aftertaste. finish is sweet and malty with vinous cask notes rich in the palate. A decent session ESB.
Wychwood Old Devil;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Pour is amber with almost no head. Nose and taste of sweetness, flowers, malts and a dry finish. Rated 6/15/02

Wychwood Old Devil;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Bottled, pasteurised, 500ml. Amber with bubbly white head. Good looking beer, but thats as far as it goes. Harsh bitterness with burnt malt and boiled hop notes. Pungent bitterness on the finish. Unfortunate.
Wychwood Old Devil;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Aroma:good malt caramel aroma... Appearance:brown with chunk of yeast,Light head... Flavor:good bitter,caramel and bitterness...
Wychwood Old Devil;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cloudy light brown with almost no head. Lots of sediment in the bottle. Aroma is fruity and a bit hoppy. Flavor is pretty plain, but has an almost cidery taste to it.
Wychwood Old Devil;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);I might have had a bad bottle, since there was an undue amount of sediment. I wish someone whould tell these English brewers that, if they want to export to the U.S., they need to use brown bottles to minimize possible damage caused by improper handling. Mine poured a hazy nut brown color with a thin white halo rather than a head. The aroma was liquor-like, sweet but piercing. Smooth medium-body, but in flavor almost watery. There’s a nice malty flavor with a touch of bitterness and a wine-like fruity finish. I don’t think what I drank is what Wychwood intended. DiCarlo’s Armanetti, Willowbrook, IL
Wychwood Old Devil;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);"If this Old Devil is named for the wicked chap on the label, it must truly be a monstrous brew. Bearing a most horrific countenance, this minion of Hell is seen stabbing an angel with his bloody trident, and grasping another with his other hand, as he sneers at us from a graveyard, where he’s also been busy beheading tombstone statues. Must be one abominable ale, right? Appearance: a swirling, carbonated mess that settles into a thick, dull morass of brown, though thoroughly transparent at the bottom, with a creamy, 1/2 "" head. Aroma: nutty, spicy, with a certain stinging hop presence and the promise of malt. Taste: bit of hops upfront that disappears quickly...time for another sip..warm, round, nutty flavor, and a short, but not unmemorable finish. Actually, it’s growing on me, leaving more of a mellow fruit flavor ringing around the mouth, but yet a minor one. Bright, but, ultimately, bare. Halfway to being an above-average brew of the ordinary stripe, this little scamp never remotely resembles the frightful demon of the label. Shows me for judging a beer by it’s cover. Nothing Satanic here, just smooth, slightly flavorful, semi-tasty..."
Wychwood Old Devil;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);This pours a ruby red with hints of dark magenta in the color. A mild head which disappeared fairly rapidly, some mild creamy brown head. The aroma yields hints of a doctors office, yeah, go ahead and imagine that with other hints of leather and caramel malts. Definite caramel malt presence here because the finish is extremely dry. The flavor is fairly refreshing up front but damn does that cardboardy maltiness bite in the end. Heavy sugar candy in the finish, for at least 60 seconds after the sip. Absolutely no alcohol presence. Some almost sappy qualities to the beer mid-taste, somewhat hard to describe. Not the best UK beer ever... I’m ready to move on now...I guess thats what you get when you buy a beer thats in a clear bottle.

Medium white head. Medium collar. Smells like apple juice, but a little less sweet. A little bit of an earthy aroma. Taste is an unsweetened apple flavor. Earthy maybe isn’t the right descriptor anymore. Slightly acidic. Then the sweet apple juice kicks in. Finishes like apple juice. Medium body. Well carbonated. It’s pretty good, but apple just isn’t an interesting enough fruit for me.
New Glarus Thumbprint Series Apple Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Glarus Brewing Company;Pours clear amber with low white head. Aroma of apple juice, light bread.

New Glarus Thumbprint Series Apple Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle, 12oz, shared by Bergstaden. 2015 edition. An unclear, copper colored beer with a small, off-white head. Lots of apples in the initial aroma, then mashed apples tending towards diacetyl and vanilla. Candy, white sugar. It’s smooth, soft and medium bodied, with flavors of mashed apples, candied apples and some vanilla. Long mashed apples finish. Pleasant indeed, perhaps with an apple cake of some kind. 7-3-7-3-14-3.4 Bottle, 12oz, shared by Bergstaden. 2016 edition. Clearer than the 2015 edition, and a bit lighter in color. More mellow aroma and flavor than 2015, much less apple. Smooth and medium to full-bodied, with a mellow carbonation. Sure prefer the 2015 edition, but it’s a decent beer anyway. 6-3-6-3-12-3. 170311

New Glarus Thumbprint Series Apple Ale;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Glarus Brewing Company;The only negative about these are that they are way too easy to drink, so you end up running out of them too quickly. Pours a hazy copper. Aroma is fresh apples with caramel malts. Taste was fresh apples, sweet on the front end, but with a dry finish, allowing you to have multiple beers for further inspection and analysis. These are phenomenal.
New Glarus Edel-Pils;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Glarus Brewing Company;"Very rich, slightly glowing copper coloured body with a bit of an orange and honey tint and a nice three centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of light biscuity malts, some citrus, a bit of caster sugar, some cardboardie funk and some pale yeast. Light-bodied; Strong biscuity flavours with lighter and less assertive malt coupled with some mellow fruits and grain flavour and a touch of bitterness. Aftertaste shows some grass, caster sugar, funk and a bit of stale malt - nothing too special here. Overall, if you pulled off this label, it would be decent at best, with a lot of mundane flavours, nothing exciting and no real profiles to sample, so sadly, I was disappointed, given the pedigree and the typically good ’classic’ beers from the brewery, but this wasn’t one of them. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from the Edelweiss Shop in Verona, Wisconsin (of course) on 24-September-2016 for US$3,00 by my mom - thanks Mom for bringing another NG beer back from Wisconsin, even though it wasn’t the bes, sampled at home in Washington on 11-October-2016."

New Glarus Edel-Pils;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Glarus Brewing Company;[Bottle] Bright golden pour with a rocky head typical of the style. Sweet grain, grass and light perfume in the aroma. Flavor notes of more grains, cracker, light citrus and mild hop bitterness. Great palate/mouthfeel for the style. Not sure what the availability of this beer typically is, but as of 4/30 the Woodman’s in Kenosha had plenty of it.
New Glarus Edel-Pils;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle. Realistically, has to be one of the best pilseners I’ve had. Sweet grain, a bit of carbonation, slightly syrupy on the palate. Slight fruit. Delicious.

New Glarus Coffee Stout;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Flavored;New Glarus Brewing Company;12floz bottle, no date, $8/NG-mix-six, nonic glass. Looks fine dark brown with tan head, but the aroma comes across as cardboard and hints of dry pet food. A pretty basic stout, mildly roasted, vague coffee, and body is medium-light - kinda watery for a stout. Decent if thought as a dark lager, but it's supposed o be a coffee stout.
New Glarus Coffee Stout;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Flavored;New Glarus Brewing Company;Mild aromatic and flavorful. Creamy wet and smooth lmao. Good stuff but newglarus never fails

New Glarus Solstice Weiss;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;New Glarus Brewing Company;12 oz bottle This was shared with hezron and malachi at a Friday night tasting of several New Glarus beers. For a two year old hefeweizen it has held up well, though I would love to try it fresh to see how much better it is. I can understand why it is one of the highest rated hefeweizens on the site. Aroma / Appearance - A thin half-finger head bubbled up out of my sampler glass. The body was a cloudy copper color with lively carbonation. It looked as good as a hefeweizen can get. The nose was bananas, wheat, Laffy Taffy, Honeycomb cereal and almonds. I could smell this for a long time. Flavor / Palate - Creamy vanilla and butterscotch open the flavor profile of this beer. A fruity mouthfeel of bananas and some other tastes please the palate before the wheat, bread and malt come through. For a two year old beer it has held up remarkably well. The finish is sweet and dry, teasing the throat. I would love for New Glarus to rerelease this so I could try it fresh.
New Glarus Solstice Weiss;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;New Glarus Brewing Company;I’ve had this beer a couple times although it’s been a while.

New Glarus Staghorn Octoberfest Beer;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;New Glarus Brewing Company;More like HOPtoberFest. Not really to style. Doesn't stack with the German boys. and is this really a lager or is it an ale? It's fruity. Almost like the Pebbles thereof. this isn't a bad beer, it's good as a generic amber lager/ale, but I don't see how it is Oktoberfest.

New Glarus Staghorn Octoberfest Beer;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;New Glarus Brewing Company;"Got in a trade with The-Adjunct-Hippie. 12 ounce bottle into dimpled mug, best before 1/9/2017. Pours slighjtly hazy orange/light copper color with a 1 finger dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of bread dough, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/caramel/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bready malt and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big bread dough, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/caramel/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Minimal herbal, grassy, spicy hop bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of bread dough, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/caramel/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Minimal dryness. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6.25%. Overall this is a delicious Oktoberfest style. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. Nothing but rich and clean Pils/Munich malt flavors, with just enough hops to balance the sweetness. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."
Southport Vienna Mild;Southport, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Southport Brewing Company;Draft at Stamford brewpub. Looks like a Vienna, but unfortunately could be a textbook example of diacetyl in beer. No thanks. Bring me a wine, please. (#4210, 8/20/2011).

Hazy medium golden with a 1/2 finger off-white head, low retention. Aroma of some sweaty Cascade hops, moderate sweet rye notes, and some caramel malt, though not too spicy. Flavor still has plenty of Cascade hops adding a bit of a floral note with moderate rye presence,some toasty malt and light caramel following. Bitterness peaks at a 5 in the dry finish.

All I would ask for is a touch more rye.

Upland Valley Weizen;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Upland Brewing Company;Draft: (re-issue at 5.3%/36 IBU....at brewpub) Very cloudy, light yellow-orange with a small, off-white head. Banana, light wheat, orange aroma. Taste is sweet..banana, wheat malt, a bit of bubblegum...very little spicing.....a light white peppery-ness. A little plain, but solid....not over-spiced like so many others.
Upland Valley Weizen;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Upland Brewing Company;On tap in Bloomington (IN) At $2.00 a pint on Sunday afternoons you cannot beat the prices at the Upland draft room. Among the ten taps I went with one of the last pours of a decent hefeweizen that was on its last legs. Assuming you are still sitting on bottles drink them now. If they are still on the shelves wait until next summer to grab some fresh. Aroma / Appearance - The cloudy rose gold body was wrapped under a dense clean white head. Banana nut bread, sweet malts, and lemony notes highlight a fresh feeling beer. It isn’t really at either end of the hefeweizen spectrum but squarely in the middle. Flavor / Palate - Chocolate chips, lemon zest, and orange glaze start with a mild impression. As it moves into the throat it adds some doughy textures and a dash of honey. Almost like a meal in a glass it has a filling presence. With no glaring flaws or major strengths this beer is worth a tick if you catch it on sale.
Upland Valley Weizen;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Upland Brewing Company;"Draft to taster at Upland. Labeled simply as ""Weizen"" on the draft board. Looks solid; transparent for a heft though. A very slightly hazy gold with ample white head at dissipates into lacing. Smells of dough and heft yeast with mild notes of clove and banana. Tastes like it smells with an average mouthfeel. Okay."
Upland Valley Weizen;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Upland Brewing Company;Tap at Brewhaven. Sweet banana, wheat, and citrus aroma. Cloudy golden with a small white head.

Upland Valley Weizen;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Upland Brewing Company;Flight pour on tap at the Indy Tasting Room (Indianapolis, IN). A new rate. Pours a richly hazed golden hue, like a lemon milkshake. Healthy bright glow, good haze, and big cakey bright white head that dies to a thicker film, good lacing throughout. Aromas are rich touches of banana esters, some apple and pear, with firm lemon, touches of spicy clove. Flaked wheat, bready malts. A vibrant banana life comes in and takes hold, touches of lemon and other fruit. Initial is creamy and smooth, light bodied overall, but on the more girth end with banana, a bunch of apple. Gentle lemon, flaked wheat and bread dough. Firm growing estery banana, touches of pear, with gentle spice, more apple and crisp malts into the middle and backend, apple and banana take over, touches of lemon, gentle grassy element. Doughy and crisp cereal malts. Finish is mellow sweet, a touch tangy tart fruit, apples really take over with firm banana, a rich fruity element. Still, quite a drinkable wheat beer. A unique spin. Nose is a bit muttled but flavors are good and the beer is quite pretty.

Upland Valley Weizen;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Upland Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub, Bloomington. Fairly nice pour, cloudy deep golden with a decent carbo level. This one’s a money-maker in this heat for sure. All in all it’s a more or less competent take on the style. Bright hops, quaffable and smooth mouthfeel, a bit of yeast and banana (not much evidence of spice). Average.
Upland Valley Weizen;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Upland Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. Pours a cloudy yellow-straw color with a decent head and a bit of lacing on the way down. Nose is some faint banana and even fainter clove along with some light grain.

Duché de Longueville Antoinette Brut Cidre Bouché de Cru;Le Theil-sur-Huisne, France;Apple Cider;CSR Cidrerie;750mL bottle, pours a hazy bright golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out lots of honey-like sweetness, champagne effervescence and grape must. Flavour is bone dry, yet somehow has some honey-like sweetness followed by some grape must, champagne, and funk.

Duché de Longueville Antoinette Brut Cidre Bouché de Cru;Le Theil-sur-Huisne, France;Apple Cider;CSR Cidrerie;750mL cork and cage bottle. I only bought this because JoeMcPhee and Can gave it good ratings. I should have listened to the average. Aroma smells like Motts apple juice. A little bit of sweet apple skins to slightly offset the strong apple. Just a little too much sweetness. Flavor sweet apple up front but ends decently with not dry but way less sweet finish. The strong carbonation helps offset the apple. I feel like the cider starts in a bad place but everything else pushes it forward. -- rated with beerbasher/winphone
Duché de Longueville Antoinette Brut Cidre Bouché de Cru;Le Theil-sur-Huisne, France;Apple Cider;CSR Cidrerie;"Thanks to Eugene for sharing - smells kind of ""juicy,"" sweet, like Mott’s applesauce - flavor is simple, but not as sweet as the nose suggests - there is a moderate, balancing acidity - some light calcium/mineral through the middle - finish has some mild phenolics - it’s alright, but a bit simple and sweet."
Duché de Longueville Antoinette Brut Cidre Bouché de Cru;Le Theil-sur-Huisne, France;Apple Cider;CSR Cidrerie;Visual: Sealed with a twisty top + real cork. Be careful this one is a gusher when opened. Pours a clear deep golden orange with a smallish mildy lasting bubbly head, clusters of fast activity, a thin layer of retention. Nose: fruity apple juice but without much sugar, airy and slightly acidic (lvl-4)-pungency Attack: dry, fizzy, yeasty Mid-palate: (lvl-0)-fruity-yet-dry sweetness, medium acidity, (MAIN) oaked apple, yeasty, light lemon citrus Finish: tart & dry apple finish. Summary: This one is deceptively dry considering the rich appearance and lively activity. I appreciate the burst of natural apple flavour but actually prefer my ciders somewhat sweeter. Thus I can’t say I love this one.

The smell is very hoppy with a bunch of grapefruit and spices hitting my nose very nicely. The taste is big on hops up front. Nice flavours of grapefruit and spiciness hit my palate causing me to make a smacking noise. ;^) There's also a bit of malt presence that sweetens it up just a tad mid way through and the finish is the closest this brew comes to being balanced but...no matter how you slice it, this is one hella good tasting IPA that really satisfies in every category. Oh yeah, aboot the 8%abv...not a factor! Bottom line: This is a world class IPA. See it? Buy it."

Château Ginger Beer;Lausanne, Switzerland;Flavored - Other;Château;On tap the at the brewpub. 20/07/2015 one day after the Etape du Tour. Aroma is big root ginger, dirty straw, grains, ginger ale. A bit stale on the nose. Mostly clear orange coloured pour / amber with a fleeting head. Flavour is dry spicy ginger, little sweet caramel, dusty stale dry malts. A bit one dimensional. Palate is dry and dusty, highish carbonation. Uber dry finish, Lingering spicy ginger.
Château Ginger Beer;Lausanne, Switzerland;Flavored - Other;Château;Ginger in colour with a thin lacy white head. Very strong ginger smell with a vinigar element. Tastes like a ginger ale soda with a stronger ginger finish. The finish is very frothy and chewey. I like it but its a bit bland.

Aroma of ginger, honey, and harsh, chemical-like alcohol - really strange for such a light beer. Body is crisp and sharp. Lots of ginger in the flavour and not much else. Aside from that weird bit in the aroma, I actually kinda enjoyed this, but I’m a sucker for ginger, so I can see how a lot of folks wouldn’t dig it as much as me.
Château Ginger Beer;Lausanne, Switzerland;Flavored - Other;Château;Bottle shared with HogTownHarry, GregClow, jerc & tupalev. Pours a clear flat yellow with a spare white head. Aroma is mostly ginger with a touch of honey and candy. The first thing you notice in the flavour is that it doesn’t taste like beer and the predominence of ginger but that’s exactly what a Ginger Beer should taste like so one can hardly fault it for that. I personally love ginger and thought that it tasted pretty good hence my higher rating. I hope more ginger fans rate it as it doesn’t deserve such a low average in my opinion.
Château Ginger Beer;Lausanne, Switzerland;Flavored - Other;Château;Bottle (330ml) - Shared with blankboy, GregClow, jerc and tupalev - courtesy of blankboy. Poured a slightly hazy pale yellow with minimal head. Aroma - whoa! - ginger, obviously, and sugary honey-sweet malt , floral cheap perfume, and alcohol, but not the good kind of alcohol, this was more like sniffing aerosol lysol. Yuck. Taste was still sweet ginger, with lemon oil, a bit of wheat and perfume. Mouthfeel was very sharp and spicy, not at all like any beer I’ve ever had. Weird.
Château Ginger Beer;Lausanne, Switzerland;Flavored - Other;Château;Headless pale golden yellow body. “Holy crap what is that?” initial aroma leads to ginger, lemon cleanser, touch of varnish and Lysol as Harry pegged. Flavour is dilute ginger with a bit of lemon, ginger ale like. Grew on me a bit after initial shock. Thin watery palate. It’s not healthy or medicinal in any way – It’s just Swiss. - Tupalev

Richbrau Hefeweizen;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Draught @ Old Dominion Beer Festival 2005: Very cloudy, opaque yellow with a medium frothy white head that lasts. I was pretty excited to see that they definitely were not filtering this one. Aroma has banana, clove, bubblegum, sweet fruity yeast. They definitely didn’t hold back with the yeast on this one, and I like them for it. Taste is light banana & clove, with sweet but not cloying wheat, and has generous helpings of yeast. Full bodied, moderate carbonation, rich & creamy texture. This was one of my favorites at the festival, though it seems many other ratebeerians and also my friend disagree with me, it may be that I was just so excited to see an unfiltered Hefe in a sea of pale ales.

Very murky, yellow ale with a small, creamy, white head. The aroma and flavor are filled with banana and clove. Well-balanced and extra light-bodied. Watery mouthfeel with lively carbonation.

Pale cloudy straw yellow body, very lively carbonation with a small quickly dissipating soapy head leaving some lacing. Grainy-yeasty aroma with a hint of lime.

Damm A.K. Damm;Barcelona, Spain;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Damm;Slightly merky, golden with hardly any head. Pilsner-like aroma. Sweet on the tongue, gets a little bitter at the end. Quite good, actually. Needs to be cold on a hot day. Better than any pilsner but nothing against some really good stuff.
Damm A.K. Damm;Barcelona, Spain;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Damm;Bottle. Pours golden with a white head. Aromas are nondescript corn, grain and cheap whiskey. The flavour profile is not quite as pungent... being creamier, with a honey flavour note and more balanced than the average macrolager. Nothing to write home about but, overall, more correct than the majority of flawed pale lagers.

A bit dull, and my dog is more Alsacian than this, but it's inoffensive and probably OK to wash down food.
Steel Reserve 211 High Gravity;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A friend drank it and said he got pretty drunk. He bought it in Torrance LA and was in party mode after one. Taste was ok. I like it!
Steel Reserve 211 High Gravity;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This beer is cheap and great! If you don’t like IPA beers then this probably isn’t for you. This is a great pregame beer. Also a beer on the budget that gets the job done. Who doesn’t like a little buzz of a beer. Cheers!
Steel Reserve 211 High Gravity;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Here's the simple reason why this brew gets a bad rap in USA - most beer drinkers here are not accustomed to a what is really a normal (unfiltered by law) alcohol content of a ""malt liquor"", which is a marketing made up term for BEER that usually signifies something cheap and high in BAC content (St.Ides, Old English, Colt45, etc.) It is actually a very decent brew that offers one an opportunity to enjoy how real beer is made before state/federal regulations get to it and water down the flavor. And to the idiot (lehers) that thinks that it tastes like coors light but with more alcohol - I strongly suggest you not only seek professional help to check your taste buds, but also stop drinking beer altogether. You are wasting too much of your money and beer that others can actually enjoy."
Steel Reserve 211 High Gravity;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Very strong alcohol content, standard beer flavor, but it feels extremely carbonated. Tastes very medicinal but gets you buzzed faster
Steel Reserve 211 High Gravity;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Okay so basically I found this beer at Walgreens and noticed it was 8.1% so I bought it because I wanted to get sauced fast. Little did I know, this tastes just like shitty coors lite. If u like coors lite, you will love this. However, I hate it and was pretty disappointed. Although, it is super cheap and I should have noticed you get what you pay for when it comes to beer.
Steel Reserve 211 High Gravity;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I know it's all a matter of taste and individual perception, but I don't know how some people here have given this beer a 1 or 1.5 rating. I have tried almost every beer sold in the USA, and this is undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best. Besides the aroma, the color, the taste and the high alcohol content, I don't get migraines from drinking this beer! Almost every other brand triggers my migraine. Fan for the rest of my life.
Steel Reserve 211 High Gravity;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Best beer so far and by far! I tried so many other beers and I'm not saying that they all bad but the STEEL RESERVE is by far the best! I like the full aroma, great taste over all! The perfect beer for somebody who likes it a bit heavier and hoppier! The price is right too! I wished it would be available in my area just like any other beer! Why is it so hard to come by? Even after I put a special order in my local store, it is hit or miss to get it! I even tried on line, but much better!

Deschutes Jubel 2000;Bend, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Deschutes Brewery;Tap @ Holiday Ale Fest... What a historic beer to have by such an innovator in craft beer. Poured hazy/cloudy dark brown/ruby-ish with an off-white head. Way past its prime here unfortunately. Leafy, oak, mild yeast. Oxidization lent towards caramel and berry fruit juice.
Deschutes Jubel 2000;Bend, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Deschutes Brewery;Appearance: Pours out a very dark, garnet-hued body with a scant, bubbly head (though it’s a bit of stretch to call it that). Smell: Sweetish dark caramel malts, touches of toastiness and woodiness as well, and a fruitiness of cranberry and cherry compote. Tiny sniff of chocolate, too. Taste: Modestly sweet maltiness akin to dark caramel and brown sugar rounded out with a nice level of toastiness. Subdued cocoa hints. Subtle herbaceous, though the hop bitterness has all but deteriorated over the last decade. Punchy fruitiness carrying over from the nose. Little spritz of sherry. Very light alcohol warmth on the malty finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-low carbonation. Drinkability: Though time has tired this one out somewhat, it’s still a pleasant, decade-later sipper. Now, then, on to the 2010!

Stoudts India Pale Ale;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Stoudts Brewing Co.;750 ml bottle. Pours a deep, slightly hazed red with a moderate off-white head that lasted though the first third of the glass and left partial lace. The aroma is grotesquely sweet. Sweet caramel, honey and rotting apples are all present in the nose. Thankfully, the flavor in no way resembles the aroma, although it is hard to escape without inhaling a bit with each sip. Caramel and malt up front followed by some musty apples. Light bitterness at the finish. Were it not for the off-putting aroma, this would be a decent IPA.
Stoudts India Pale Ale;Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Stoudts Brewing Co.;NICE brew sweet with amber and hops piney and with citrus -basic grapefruit- there is also a bit of other fruit flavor. sweet tawny and maybe musty never had it before. how i made this one boys you wish you could know! helps to be surrounded by women from a very young age, and certainly worth the effort. prune and raisin way in the back of the flavor profile. this is gonna be a good year!

Light carbonation, kind of crisp. Mild slick texture. Mild hint of butter, not noticeable until the end. Very nice english-style bitter. Complemented my burger & fries perfectly.

Hazy Yellow body with white fizzy head that was gone fast. At first I thougt maybe the lables at the brewery got mixed up. Flavor was the same as the Frog Light bitter. But as this warmed up had a somewhat lemon flavor ligering on palate.
Black Mountain Juanderful Wheat;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;The beer is a “Chill Hazed” light gold or lemon yellow, take your pick, portly white head, creamy in texture and the residual lace a fine covering for the glass. Nose is lemon like, hints of wheat or “bread dough”, once again your choice, quite a pleasant nose with a sweet start, top is fair to middling in feel. Finish is crisply acidic, the hops are mild but flavorful in their spiciness, dry long lasting aftertaste, a great beer for the hot Arizona summers, tap only at this time.

No head, no lacing, no aromas, no bitterness, no malt character....extremely bland, except for that bad taste it leaves in your mouth. Not good at all! Bad actually!
Black Mountain Ocotillo Amber;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;12 oz. bottle part of a mixed 12er from my brother in Mesa - Pours a clear amber color with a one finger thick off white head. Head fades pretty quick. Very light spotty lacing. Aroma is a toasted malt with a touch of diacetyl. Flavor is much of the same. Medium body. Worth a try, I guess.
Black Mountain Ocotillo Amber;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;At Black Mountain brewpub. Light amber in color with no head. Faint sweet malt aroma in the nose. Light bodied, with a touch of carbonation and sweet malt flavors. Boring and weak.
Black Mountain Ocotillo Amber;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;Bottle poured a nice dark amber with very little head or lacing. Aroma is all malt and very sweet. Flavor is sweet malt with maybe just a hint of hops. Finishes with a metalic, very bland aftertaste.
Black Mountain Ocotillo Amber;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;Aroma is like candy, sweet licorice. Amber body no head to speak of, bland other than body color. Sweet malty flavor that is dry on the finish. Man I would want something more refreshing than this on a hot Az summer day.
Black Mountain Ocotillo Amber;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;Light amber hue. No head. No carbonation. No aroma. Malt/caramel liquid. No bitterness. Bad.
Black Mountain Ocotillo Amber;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;The beer pours a nice golden amber color with a modest head and pertinent lace to cover the glass. The nose is all malt, crisp fresh and clean, quite pleasant to sniff. Sweet at the start, top skinny, and the finish stinging it its acidic bite, the hops adequate, dry and lingering aftertaste, a drinkable beer and one suited for these hot climes.
Black Mountain Gold;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;From old J tasting notes. Hazy orange gold color topped by a bubbly white head. Overly sweet malt nose. Sweet malt flavor is reminiscent of bubble gum. Faint hops in finish. Not very good.

Black Mountain Gold;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;Basically the average pale style lager...well, average in taste. Nothing great about it. Bland, lacking character in all aspects. Decent at best
Black Mountain Gold;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;First whiff of this one thougt I had a Miller Lite. Aroma of lite pilsner beer gainy. Gold body small head that goes flat. Light bitterness to the flavor. Clean and fresh I would have to disagree. Kind of stale on palate.
Black Mountain Gold;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;Light yellow with lacy head. Sweet scent. Malty. Mellow. Average........
Black Mountain Gold;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;Unimpressive to say the least. Drinkable to say the most....................
Black Mountain Gold;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;On the pour a translucent gold with a decent white head that is frothy in texture, the lace adequate to cover the glass. Nose is fresh, crisp and clean, start is somewhat sweet, and the top thin to middling in feel to the palate. Finish is moderate in carbonation, the hops apropos to the style, a beer meant for the hot times of the year, drinkable but as I said before lagers, just don’t do a thing for me.
Black Mountain Frog Light;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;From old tasting notes. Hazy yellow gold color.mcreamy white head. Sweetish wet cardboard aroma. Tangy sweet malt flavor I somewhat flavorful. Light hop finish.

Pours a clear golden pale blonde brew with a creamy slow dissolving white head that leaves behind some spotty lacing. Aroma of light bready malt, a touch of citrus zest. Taste is light bodied, some carbonation with a watery citrus grain malt flavor. Finish is crisp, clean cut with no aftertaste what-so-ever. A typical diet beer.
Black Mountain Frog Light;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;Had this on tap at their brewery...not very good. Pours very light with not much head...very little lacing. Hop character lacking, malt character shines through, but nothing to write home about. Very bland, but normal light lager. Would rather a Bud Select anyday.
Black Mountain Frog Light;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;12 oz. bottle my brother picked up from the brewery this past Winter - Pours a clear light golden color with a one finger thick white head. Light spotty lacing. Lively carbonation. Flavor and aroma is diacetyl. Medium body. Not bad.
Black Mountain Frog Light;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;Aroma was skunky. Good gold color to the body. Had a very small fizzy head that was gone in 30 seconds. Got a bitter beer face at first gulp. Good thing I was using this for dinner wash.
Black Mountain Frog Light;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;Nearly clear yellow. Cucumber sweetness. No bitterness, little malt. Unimpressive.
Black Mountain Frog Light;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;The beer pours the prototypical lager golden yellow with a modest white head, frothy in texture and a bright white in color. Nose is citrus crisp, fresh and clean, somewhat sweet like the start, top is thin in feel. Finish has a prickly acidity, the hops are mild as one would expect and the aftertaste dry and lingering. In all honesty lagers and pilsners are not my style of beer, but it is a drinkable beer as it thirst quenching and made for the hot desert summers.
Black Mountain Lemon Lager;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;As it sets in the glass a light gold color, the head personable in size, frothy in texture the color off white and the lace a fine sheet to seal off the glass. Tangy lemon aroma, sweet, crisp and refreshing is the nose, start tangy sweet, nice malt profile with the top light to medium in feel. Finish crisp and refreshing, hops mild and pleasant, somewhat dry aftertaste. A good drinking beer for the hot summer months, tap only at this time.
River Market Bomber Blonde Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Market Brewing Company;Hazy dark gold with a white head. The aroma was bready with some mushrooms. The taste was bread crust and peanut shells. Light and bland overall with a soapy finish. The body was flat liek all of their beers on tap.
River Market Bomber Blonde Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Market Brewing Company;Very light with some assertive maltiness, slightly sweet with a bit of a grainey texture. Crisp and clean, light bodied and is decent on a hot summer day, but not something I would regularly choose to drink.
River Market Bomber Blonde Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Market Brewing Company;Draft: Nothing in the way of head, like all blondes easy on the eyes. Nothing reall there in the way of aroma, a bit grassy was the only major taste a little bland.
River Market Bomber Blonde Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Market Brewing Company;Bright yellow with a razor-thin head. Candy character, almost gumbally. OK if you like a sweet malty beers.
River Market Bomber Blonde Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Market Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a golden color with a medium head. Medium carbonation. Has a happy aroma of grain. Pleasant and moderated malt flavor to the taste. Smooth palate with a crisp finish. Not my favorite style, but a competent entry nonetheless.
River Market Bomber Blonde Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Market Brewing Company;Okay, with a bad aftertaste. Almost acid-like. More of a beer for people who don’t like microbrews, as this also seemed flat. Probably tastes a lot better outside on a hot day.
River Market Bomber Blonde Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Market Brewing Company;A light and refreshing beer, nice light maltiness. Very smooth palate and finish. Not much carbonation. Okay for summertime, or for those who don’t normally drink good beer.
River Market Sodbuster Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Market Brewing Company;On tap at the river market brewery. Pours a clear and pale gold with a small white head. Not very lacy. Some light smells of earthy and piny hops with a breadlike character. Pale malt gives it a little sweetness. Taste is really light, not as hoppy as other cheap microbrews (like a Boulevard), but the light pale malt taste balanced well with the limited amount of hops. Overall, meh.
River Market Sodbuster Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Market Brewing Company;24 oz pour is golden with a white head. This batch is light on the hops wet grain and balanced maltiness. This beer varies from pretty good to very average depending on the batch.
River Market Sodbuster Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Market Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub Pours pale golden with a bit of white head. Light earthy hop aroma, with some grainy character and light esters. Balanced, but light, hop and malt flavors. Light body. High carbonation. Balanced finish. Very avarage, but it managed to quench my thirst.
River Market Sodbuster Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Market Brewing Company;THis was not the greatest pale ale that I have ever tried, but it was certainly quaffable.
River Market Sodbuster Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Market Brewing Company;On tap: A decent beer here. It had a browninsh amber color with a thin whispy bubbly layer around the edge of the glass. Aroma was a little malty. Taste was a bit of caramel, and steady dose of hops.
River Market Sodbuster Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Market Brewing Company;Nice eye-appeal ... with a beach-wave-foam of a head that’s still stuf-like after 15 minutes. Mashy aroma, milky texture with an almost sweet, almost hoppy flavor. so-so.
River Market Sodbuster Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Market Brewing Company;On tap at the Brewpub. Dark gold in color. Medium palate. Slight buttery flavor. Some bitterness at the finish. Slight hop aroma. Nothing harsh about this one. It just seems to be there. Probably my least favorite from what I think might be KC’s best brewpub.
River Market Sodbuster Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Market Brewing Company;Nice pale ale. Not nearly as good as the India Pale Ale. Nice clear brown color, again with little to no carbonation. Light hoppiness and bitterness that pale ales are known for. Almost tasted water-down. Still good, but not terrific.
River Market Sodbuster Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Market Brewing Company;Update: Okay, I don't know what's going on at ol' River Market, but the beer I sampled tonight was like a brewer's first and none-too-successful recreation at a guess of what this once tasty brew must have been like. Faint aroma of lightly bready malt, some lightly citrusy hop. Dark golden color, hazy, no head or effervescence. Flavor has a slight amount of malt sweetness, then some sourish, lightly tinny and citrusy hop flavor washes in, leaving nothing in its wake. Watery palate, distinct lack of body. Finish is bitter but bland. This is a mere shadow of its former self. Too bad. Original rating: This beer is a hop-lover's friend. Very nice Pale Ale interpretation, always a winner. Just the right amount of creamy carbonation, and nice aroma. Mmm, hops...
River Market Red;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;River Market Brewing Company;On tap at the river market brewery. Pours a clear red with a light tan head that lingered for awhile. Pretty good lacing on the glass. Not a bad looking beer. The aroma, like most reds in my opinion, was tough to pick up, but what was there was some roasted nuts, caramel malts, and an evident amount of piny/breadlike hops. Compared to the other beers that this brewery makes, this was cleary the winner when it came to taste. It actually tasted like the brewer knew what he was doing. A sweet and grainy malt background finishing with a light bitter hop taste. Not a lot of lingering, but the balance was nice. Overall, nothing special, but damn better than anything else the river market offers.
River Market Red;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;River Market Brewing Company;Medium chestnut body with a yellowish khaki head. The aroma was walnuts and bread crust. The taste was roasted almonds with some caramel in the finish. There is barely a kiss of hops in this one even though they tout the hops in it. Meh.
River Market Red;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;River Market Brewing Company;Decent amount of caremel maltiness, sweetness upfront, with some nice hop charateristics up front, that kind of fade into the background, melding into a smooth nicely balanced bitterness combined with the bittersweet malts. Decent, easy drinking beer.
River Market Red;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;River Market Brewing Company;This is a deep amber/red beer. It presents a fair caramel malt basis, is smooth and lightly bittered. Slightly above average.
River Market Red;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;River Market Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours dark amber with reddish overtones. The beer is cloudy from chill haze. Pretty good head retention. Very nice balance to this ale. Up front it is very hoppy, but then finishes with a malt sweetness. Toasted malt is pronounced. This is somewhat better than the Ska Pinstripe Red Ale. This beer deserves neither of the other two previous scores.
River Market Red;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;River Market Brewing Company;Decent Irish Ale. Nice color, similar to Killian’s. Little to no carobonation, which may have led to its sweeter than normal taste. Little hoppiness, with pleasant aftertaste.
River Market Red;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;River Market Brewing Company;"Update: I'm not even sure this commercial description is accurate anymore, so different was the beer I sampled tonight from the previous tasting... Light aroma of sweet, caramel malt and a tad of hops. Head which quickly diminished to nothing, no visible carbonation. (No wonder either, the beer is basically flat.) Red color, clear. Some grainy maltiness and a bit of caramel sweetness, then a slightly spicy hoppiness creeps in. Watery palate, finish is not much to speak of. Way disappointing aspect of the revisit to this once fairly respectable brewpub. Original rating: A bit of tanginess at the start of this brew, with a nice hoppiness on the finish. Somewhat malty body. Not too bad; I've had better, though."
River Market Flying Crow Porter;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Porter;River Market Brewing Company;on tap at the river market brewery. pours a watery looking black with a small tan head. Decent amount of lacing. Aroma was more chocolate than roasty with some coffee and burnt malt hints. The flavor was extremely watered down with a real sour and acidic taste. Just a tad smoky, but thats about it. Pretty dreadful. Very light and lacking body, character, and taste. I was disappointed with this brewery.
River Market Flying Crow Porter;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Porter;River Market Brewing Company;Normally, I look forward to a subpar brewer’s porter. How can you mess up this pedestrian style? Well, River Market found a way. The body was black with ruby at the edges and a khaki head. The aroma was caramel and almond bark candy. There was also a little bit of light roasted coffee. The taste was light, watered down coffee with some hints of nasty hard raspberry candy. Very sweet finish like something I have never expereinced in a porter. Dreadful.
River Market Flying Crow Porter;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Porter;River Market Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub Poured mostly black with a little bit of brown head. The aromas and flavor were pretty much the same. Chocolate and coffee, with some light roasted notes. A little bit hoppy. Medium body. Light carbonation. Roast dryness and a bit of creamy sweetness in the finish. This beer was pretty good. I drink it again.
River Market Flying Crow Porter;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Porter;River Market Brewing Company;This was a bit too astringent and roasty with above average carbonation to be really enjoyable. Has the right amoun tof roastiness, with some light coffee and chocolate notes, but not very well balanced with some bitter hoppiness in the finish.
River Market Flying Crow Porter;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Porter;River Market Brewing Company;Very black with a thin tan head. This is sweet and bitter at the same time with a hint of smoke but no real character that spoke to me.
River Market Flying Crow Porter;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Porter;River Market Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. mahogany black with reddish overtones when held in the light. Pronounced hazelnut aroma! Rich sweetness, smooth rich complex palate. Must have a high OG. This is an excellent porter.
River Market Flying Crow Porter;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Porter;River Market Brewing Company;Roasty American-style Porter. Semi-sweet chocolate and coffeeish maltiness, creamy head and body. Very dark in color, opaque. Scores extra points for not being served on nitrogen! Nice coffeeish, roasty, tangy flavor, slightly bitter and dry finish. Medium bodied. Great for a ’last beer’ at River Market or on the rare occasions where you can grab a bomber to go.

Smell is tart ( lemon acid) bit plastic as well. Taste is sharp, dry tart ( lemon sour) intense lemon tartness, but it's gone immidiatly. Not very complex, no depth... I respect their attempt, but it's not even in the same ballpark as the real stuff.
Saranac ESB;Utica, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;The head builds up tall, thick and foamy. It is light tan in color and has good retention. As it slowly fades down to thin covering, which lasts until the end, it makes some slick spotty lacing on the glass. Under the head is a nice amber colored liquid with very good clarity. The aroma has a simple sweet floral hop bouquet. Its flavor has a mildly sweet malty body with nice floral and citrus hops that produce a soft mellow bitterness that balances the malt flavor well. The texture has a soft easy drinking feel with good carbonation and a medium body. It had an enjoyable flavor and an easy drinking body. Overall solid.
Saranac ESB;Utica, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;It would be hard for this beer not seem balanced as there’s next to nothing to it. Incredibly mild and watery.
Saranac ESB;Utica, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Has the hop/malt balance of an ESB, too thin and a little watery for it to be a good ESB.
Saranac ESB;Utica, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Poured into a pint glass. I have no doubt that this beer is going to suck, as just about everything Saranac makes does, but let’s see. 4.5 A: Looks great. Nearly three fingers of thick frothy head. Great retention and plenty of lacing. 3.0 S: Barely anything at all. A bit of floral hops, but that’s about it. 2.0 T: Where the hell is everything? There’s barely any taste at all. Worst of all is that the hop characteristics barely show up....and IN AN ESB! 2.5 M: Light body. Smooth because nothing’s going on. Terrible. 2.0 D: I’d drink this over BMC, but that’s about it. This beer is neither extra special or bitter. Once again Saranac has produced a great looking shitty beer. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 01-18-2009 01:31:20
Saranac ESB;Utica, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Nice golden amber pour in the glass. Nose and taste of sweet bitter, light spruce and malts. Rated 12/20/2000
Saranac ESB;Utica, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;One thing I enjoy as a beer critic is getting to try new beers and especially new beer styles. You’d think I’d have drunk everything by now but the ESB style has eluded me until recently. Thanks to the Saranac “12 Beers of Winter” mix pack I can now say I’ve tried an Extra Special Bitter and I quite liked it. It seems to be something of a hybrid of a lager and a pale ale, plus it was tasty and easy to drink – seems like a good beer to me. POUR, COLOR AND AROMA Saranac ESB poured very smoothly to a dark red/copper color that was crystal clear and without much carbonation evident. It formed a white, fizzy head that didn’t last long but never completely evaporated, either. The aroma seemed like that of a generic mass-market lager but with a distinctive character of extra hops. I didn’t notice any citrus notes, but I was thankful for the hops instead of adjunct ingredients. TASTE Well, they don’t call it an Extra Special Bitter for nothing. As soon as the beer hit my palate, bitter was the first flavor I noticed. It was very similar to an India Pale Ale, the difference being there was no tart or citrusy underling flavor here. In fact, it’s quite dry, but I wouldn’t call it bland. Overall, the strong bitterness made up for what would otherwise be a fairly standard beer taste. FINISH Sometimes the tastier beers can be difficult to drink, especially if their taste is derived from bitterness. Such is the case for Saranac ESB which has quite a rough edge to it. The dry palate might make for a good taste, but it’s not proportional to the finish. Not that this is a challenge to drink, certainly not for the connoisseur, but a little smoother would have been nice. BODY It’s actually difficult to make an honest comment on this beer’s weight since neither its potency nor its number of calories is printed on the bottle and is not listed on the brewer’s website. Since it’s a very hoppy beer I’d estimate both statistics are quite high. I wasn’t overwhelmed by the beer, but it did feel quite heavy afterwards. FINAL THOUGHTS I don’t have any frame of reference to compare Saranac Extra Special Bitter against another beers of the style, so as a beer on its own I found it to be tasty, original and genuinely enjoyable. It’s not a perfect beer by any means, but it’s enjoyable and that’s what counts. NOTE: watch the video version of this review at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP5obF_1hfU
Saranac ESB;Utica, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Light copper, almost gold. Very pale in color for an ESB. Whispy white head retains well. Not very aromatic but does have a musty, old chest hop aroma. Reminds me of an old dusty room. On the palate the body is rather thin and tepid in flavor. Not a very exciting ESB at all. Finish is short with some odd ""off"" flavors."
Saranac ESB;Utica, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Dark orange, looks like a glass of clear honey. Solid English ale head, bubbly and light brown. Nice color, inviting. Very good toasted English malt aroma. Sweet and slightly nutty. Hop is ever so mild. Like a nice toasted, nutty English ale. An initial toasted malt, only slightly caramel sweetness. Woody hop comes in at the end. Good combo of sharp and soft bitters. Decent. Somewhat fizzy, creamy, with a little bite. A solid ESB. Sweetly bitter and very drinkable.
Saranac ESB;Utica, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Overall Impression: Another beer you find in the Saranac mixers, and another decent example of its style...
Saranac ESB;Utica, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a copper body with an off whit head. Bread y, grain y, light earth hoppiness floral hints bitter earth and a light malty body. Caramel malts, simple and decent.

Lancaster India Brown Ale;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Lancaster Brewing Co.;clear, copper-reddish color with a smooth light head that was slow to depart. Just a bit hoppy for a brown ale but that didn’t bother me at all.

Lancaster India Brown Ale;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Light breadiness throughout. A bit watery. Lingering strong bitterness in swallow. Overly hoppy for a brown.
Lancaster India Brown Ale;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Slightly weak malty aroma with a hint of hops. Clear copper brown, with very little head.

Climax Extra Special Bitter Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Climax Brewing Company;Draught @ Barcade, Jersey City, New Jersey. Pours slight hazy brown with an offwhite head. Aroma of malt, little caramel, light grainy, light grassy hops. Flavor is light sweet, malt, grain, hint of caramel, grassy hops.

Climax Extra Special Bitter Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Climax Brewing Company;22 ounce bottle. Hazy Amber orange color topped by a massive rocky beige head. Medicinal, caramel malt nose. Unusual, tart toasted malt flavor. A bit sour and funky. Not typical for the ESB style. Meh.
Climax Extra Special Bitter Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Climax Brewing Company;[ Bottle ][ 2oz ][ Tasting ][ ][ Champagne Flute ][ 12.07.14 ] murky amber, fizzy white head laces well. Heavy chlorine nose, moderate sugar, lightly doughy. Ashy front palate, olive tomato through the end, oily with sugary balsamic. Am I eating a Greek salad? Off notes with sugar underneath and way overcarbonated.
Climax Extra Special Bitter Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Climax Brewing Company;Seems like this is old and not very well maintained. Pours orange with OK head and lacing. This is either off or not well brewed. Bottle from total wine.
Climax Extra Special Bitter Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Climax Brewing Company;Big thanks to Jecker aka Josh for this one. A - Pours out amber orange with a small one finger tall white head leaving light lace down the glass. S - Smells of doughy caramel malt, dulled grassy hops, toffee, and some faint citric fruit. T - Starts off with a big sweet caramel malt kiss slowly giving way to a mix of toffee and dulled out grassy hops. The malt really controls this one but it never really gets to the point of being overpowering. The finish is more sweet malt, lingering for some time. M - Medium-Light body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Very malty feel, lingering throughout consumption. O - I liked this one. It was very malt forward and it could have used a bit more hops to help even things out but it was still plenty enjoyable as is.
Climax Extra Special Bitter Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Climax Brewing Company;Unruly, bizarre aroma of latex paint, bubblegum, feet, cedar, and varnish. Clear amber, huge sticky off white head. Foam climbs out of the bottle from what was left behind from my pour. Vinegar and cedar, mold and moss. Ugh, something seems wrong here. It feels like an ambitious effort at greatness but fell short of mediocrity.
Climax Extra Special Bitter Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Climax Brewing Company;(Bottle). My bottle must be a very bad batch. Even the slowest angled pour causes the foam to erupt and overflow the glass. The flavor is slightly sour and chalky mouthfeel. Drain pour. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Climax Extra Special Bitter Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Climax Brewing Company;Serving: Bottle from Total Wine Sterling. It pours a hazy amber color with a large, frothy, off white head. The nose is fruity and floral. It’s overcarbonated and prickly on the tongue. Sour vinegar flavors. Clearly infected. Drainpour.

Climax Extra Special Bitter Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Climax Brewing Company;"12oz bottle I picked up at Total Wine in Sterling. Pours a hazy, dark orange with some rocky, lacing, white head. Uh oh, aroma makes me nervous; stale cardboard, some dried lemon peel, rotting white grape. Whoa, flavor is definitely infected, strong grapefruit peel, cardboard, nettles. Trashy finish. Bad bottle maybe? Either way, drain pour. ***** Re-rate from December 2014. 12oz bottle pours a hazy orange with some foamy, white head. Nose of garbage, rotting tropical fruit, plastic, dust. Flavor has guava, mild pear, trashy though, hints of butyric acid, pixie sticks. Super carbonated, harsh finish. Worse than the first time I had this. 3-3-5-1-6."
Climax India Pale Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Climax Brewing Company;From a bomber. Pours a clear copper with a massive, long-lasting head. Weedy aroma. Flavors of grass and resin. Bitter finish.
Climax India Pale Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Climax Brewing Company;On tap while stuck in Newark. Diacetyl aroma apparent right away, in front of caramel malt, and lemon and strawberry accents. Almost clear amber under white wisps and collar. Sweet and moderate bitterness in the flavour leaves the balance towards sweet. Caramel and butterscotchy diacetyl dominate earthy, English hops. Medium body, moderate carbonation, smooth. Classic Ringwood beer that is likely to be misunderstood.
Climax India Pale Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Climax Brewing Company;Cask at Uno’s Metuchen. Pours clear amber with a small, bubbly off-white head, short retention with light lacing. Aroma is toast, caramel, and cookie malt with earthy hops, dates and figs. Flavor is moderate hops and bitterness, light esters, cherry, and a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.
Climax India Pale Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Climax Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Pours a hazy burnt orange color with no head. Aroma of caramel, candied oranges, and slightly floral. Taste is caramel up front, followed by some sweet citrus fruit in the middle, and ends with a sharp piny bitterness.
Climax India Pale Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Climax Brewing Company;Bottle. Nose biggest in caramel, sweet with fruit, hops, pours ruby-tinged golden with a large rocky beige head. Taste is very sweet with much lighter bitterness. Caramel and generic but very intense fruitiness, aggressive medium-full body. I can never tell with these homebrewish ales if they’re infected or just fermented weirdly, yeast is always out of control.
Climax India Pale Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Climax Brewing Company;For starters, I should have known better simply because the bottle cap is generic. If the brewery can’t afford to brand their bottle cap, how can they afford decent hops? Anyway, carefully pouring the beer into my mug resulted in half beer, half foam. I had to wait a good 10 minutes for the foam to settle before emptying the bottle. The beer itself has very little IPA flavor to it. Hardly a hint of hoppiness or bitterness. It reminds me more of a Blue Moon with the orange already squeezed into the bottle before it was even poured. This is the second time I’ve tried Climax IPA, six months from the first try, so it’s not a fluke. If you’re looking for a true microbrew IPA, don’t include Climax on your hit list.

Climax India Pale Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Climax Brewing Company;Draught at Rattle&Hum, NYC. Cloudy golden/grey beer with a nice lasting offwhite head. Malty fruity hoppy aroma, grass, hay, floral, citrus, some pepper. Herbal citrus flavor, grassy, metal notes, fruity, grapefruit, banana notes. Decent without being special.
Climax India Pale Ale;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Climax Brewing Company;Bottle. I think my bottle must have been a bit too old -- foamed up pretty huge when I poured. Light brown to deep caramel color, tan frothy head. Taste is off -- a little astringent and coupled with high carbonation. I would try again just to see if this is an outlier.

Schoune Chouinard;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Belgian-style session ale, Chouinard is the same beer as Schoune Amber. A complex tartness is the signature, with peachy notes and a touch of bubblegum. A resample showed some spice as well.

H.C. Berger Snowman Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Had this beer on 8/1/2002. Color is a bright gold with good carbonation and nice head. Aroma is a light sweet malt scent. Taste is sweet and bitter. Starting with a light/medium body it goes down with a slightly rich feel and sweet flavor. It finished with an overly sweet malt flavor that is backed by a sudden bitterness. Its flavor is too heavy and rich for a summer brew.

H.C. Berger Snowman Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Slightly hazy golden yellow with a medium diminishing white head. Some floaties are present. Aroma of light bread, cereal, honey, creamed corn and a hint of lemon. Medium watery body with soft carbonation. Slightly musty flavor of honey, light bread, pepper, and adjunct related sweetness. Not good, not bad, I can see why it is now retired. Thanks to slikwily for this one!
H.C. Berger Snowman Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;A very, very, very small white head with fine sized bubbles that quickly diminished. The body was mostly transparent with soft carbonation and a pale yellow hue. The nose was lightly malty, sweet, citrus notes and fruity. The flavor was very flat, bland and boring with a sweet and light fruitiness. The mouthfeel was smooth, watery and thin making for a light textured beer with very sparse lacing. Not a beer that I will recommend.
H.C. Berger Snowman Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;This bottled brew poured a very small longlasting head of fine to medium sized white colored bubbles that left behind a carbonated slightly hazy yellow colored body and a good lace. The aroma ia a mild malt dough. The mouthfeel is smooth and tingly with a flavor of malty fruit like apricot.
H.C. Berger Snowman Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Pours a light yellowy color with a thin white head. Aroma and flavor are lightly hoped and have a touch of citrus. Cute artwork on the label, but the beer is pretty bad. You can almost always tell when you pour a yellowy beer that it isn't going to be good.
H.C. Berger Snowman Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;8/1/03: bottle. light pils aroma. golden yellow body. very watery with a lemon-citrus flavor.
H.C. Berger Snowman Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Light yellow body with a quickly dissipating white head. No lacing. Smells like corn and other adjuncts. A tiny bit of yeast is behind that corny nose. A little bit of that corny flavor with a hint of yeast in the flavor. Very thin and bland.. Smooth on the palate but had an odd mouthfeel.
H.C. Berger Snowman Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;H.C. Berger Brewing Co.;Pale straw color,small white head that faded super fast.Wheat aroma maybe a mild malt presence,mild hops maybe a slight spice to it along with a mild fruit accent.Very mild taste,mild malt,mild wheat with a sweetness to it.the fruit doesn't really come through to well,the same with the hops.The after taste is mild at best with a definate sweet tone that is mostly malt and maybe citrusy the feel is like water.I don't know but this brew almost seems to try to be a lot of different styles but doesn't quite fit anything other then a wheat beer IMO.A nice brew to try once but not worth having any more then that.
Dieu du Ciel! Cornemuse;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;"(cask) clear, bright, dark orange brown colour with a small beige head; aroma of toffee; balanced flavour, bit weird and chemical, long light bitter finish"
Dieu du Ciel! Cornemuse;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;On tap at the brewpub, Andy Ricky PJ Andrew R. Dark pour and little/no head. Overall impression is that it’s a good scotch ale, but lacking a bit of the sticky tar-molasses-sugary quality that makes the style a treat to me. On the right track just a tad underdone and mellow. Still enjoyed much.

Aroma is of butterscotch with light moked notes and light fruits. Taste is slightly sweet and about the same as aroma. Medium body. Low carbonation. Good Scotch Ale, but the lack of carbonation didn’t help and it as somewhat bland and boring.

Harp Strong;Dundalk, County Louth, Ireland;Pilsener - Imperial;Dundalk (Diageo);On tap, half pint. Golden clear beer with a bubbly white head. Sparkling look, in fact this is a gassy one. Strange nose, not inviting. Aroma has some malts, corn and syrup, but lots of cork, chemical stuff and alcohol. Watery and carbonated body, poor stuff but and the booze came up incredibly quick.

Belgh Brasse 8;Amos, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Belgh Brasse (Groupe Geloso);Mysteriously found this in a Montreal grocery store, must be a few years old. Cloudy (with lots of sediments)Brownish amber with an initially big off-white head that doesn't survive the chalice test. Light aroma of mild herbal hops and malty orange. Rather sweet malt with a notably short finish, dry and slightly bitter, but noticeably short-lived, with a hint at cardboard, a little overcarbonated for a belgian too. Not worth keeping up any longer.
