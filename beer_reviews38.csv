Edgar Harding Medium Cider;Somerset    ,England;Apple Cider;Edgar Harding Cider;A farmhouse cider from an obscure Somerset producer. Although Edgar Harding�s cider turns up from time to time at festivals,I could find virtually nothing about the producer (not even a full address) on the web. This is about as authentic as it gets.

New Knoxville Brown Ale;Knoxville, Tennessee, United States;Brown Ale;New Knoxville Brewing Company;"On draught from the brewer at the Floyd Fandango. Not a terrible offering here... a bit better than the average, and will make for a decent sessionista. The pour is dark walnut brown, almost like transparent chocolate. The off-white head is quickly diminishing and small. The aroma contains caramel, dark cherries, some candied nuts and a slight hop, which presents itself as nicely unique. The flavors follow in tow, and as the beer warms, traverses from a smooth to a bit stickier palate. It shows off a nutty characteristic, somewhere between esters and caramel malts. The finish is clean, but also begins to change slightly as it warms.... hops open up to fruition more. The weight feels nice and light. Overall, not bad... but does take a little ""warming time"" to be fully appreciated."

New Knoxville Brown Ale;Knoxville, Tennessee, United States;Brown Ale;New Knoxville Brewing Company;A cloudy medium brown color with no head. A suprisingly hoppy aroma for a brown ale.

Thatchers Medium Sweet Cider;Winscombe, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Thatchers Cider;"It is often difficult to match up ciders on offer at beer festivals with more generally available bottled and commercial draught ciders from the same producer. That was the case here. SilkTork and I had a Thatchers cider at Kent Beer Festival which was described simply as ""Draught Scrumpy"". At GBBF there were two ciders from Thatchers labelled as ""Medium Dry"" and ""Medium Sweet"" cider. This was certainly not the same as the cider we had at Kent as it was a rather startling bright orange colour. As for the rest, it was a typical Thatchers product - clean and refreshing, with plenty of fruit character and at the traditional end of the commercial spectrum. Not very cloudy - just a slight haze. Perfectly acceptable, but not very challenging. From the barrel at GBBF 2004."

Barkers Perry - Dry (Draught);Worcester, Worcestershire, England;Perry;Barkers Cider;A dry perry from a highly regarded small producer in Worcestershire. Perry is often rather softer and a little sweeter than equivalent ciders and that was the case with this one. Very pale colour with cloudy appearance. The aroma is more woody than farmyardy. There�s some fruit left in the flavour and it�s not that dry. A very pleasant traditional perry but not as challenging as some. Quite mellow. From the barrel at GBBF 2004.

Wolferstetter Weizen Bock;Vilshofen, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Wolferstetter Br�u;Dunkler Weizenbock mit 7,1 % Alkohol und 16,5 % Stammw�rze. Hat etwas mehr Kohlens�ure, was das Bier sch�n lebendig macht, ohne zu scharf zu sein. Eher kr�ftig und herb, anfangs leicht alkoholig - recht gut trinkbar. Eine Verwandtschaft zum hellen und dunklen Weizen aus gleichem Hause ist erkennbar - der typische kr�ftige Wolferstetter-Geschmack ist vorhanden (schl�gt aber nicht so stark durch wie man es bei 16,5 % Stammw�rze erwarten w�rde). Der Bockbierfreund k�nnte sagen, dass Bier hat etwas wenig Highlights - aber es fehlen auch typische negative Eigenschaften von Starkbieren, wie unangenehm s��e Malzigkeit oder bitterer, alkoholiger Nachgeschmack. Somit auch gut f�r den Normalweizentrinker geeignet. Gibt�s nur zur Weihnachts- und Starkbierzeit.

Allerdings wurde auch die allgemeine Milde �bernommen, f�r einen Weizenbock ganz allgemein ist das zu schwach.

Die erw�nschten vergorenen Fruchtnoten bleiben ebenso aus wie andere w�rzige Aromen,d ie dem Bier Schwung verleihen k�nnten. Zum Ende ergibt sich immerhin eine leichte Bannigkeit in der Hefe, die man sich aber schon bei einem normalen Weizen w�nscht.

Wolferstetter Dunkel Spezial;Vilshofen, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Wolferstetter Br�u;"Sorry for the german rating, but this is a lousy rating from my ""newbie"" time (2007-2009), and it�s not worth of being translated. I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! Das Bier im Glas ist leicht dunkel mit gutem Rotstich, die Krone h�lt sich dezent lange. Geruchlich variieren r�stige und s��liche Malznoten gut miteinander. Der Antrunk ist kr�ftig r�stmalzig, eine leicht s��e Note gesellt sich hinzu. Der Nachgeschmack hallt ein wenig kaffeeartig und karamellig nach. Zum Mittelteil wird�s ein wenig herber, der Hopfen kommt besser durch, aber die R�stmalznote beh�lt die Oberhand, was mir pers�nlich sehr gut gef�llt. Was leider negativ auff�lt ist, dass das Dunkle nen Tick zu s�� ist. Leider kann das Bier nicht ganz mit dem spitzenm��igen �u�eren mithalten, aber dennoch ein klasse Dunkles!"

Allagash Curieux;Portland, Maine, United States;Tripel;Allagash Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Why the hell does this beer even work. A tripel? In bourbon barrels?! Somehow it works extremely well. Sweet honey malt, Belgian yeast, big bourbon and oak notes, a hint of vanilla. Not only does it work but it's smooth as hell. This goes down way too easy.
Allagash Curieux;Portland, Maine, United States;Tripel;Allagash Brewing Company;Nose slightly lemony with a slight breadiness. Some minerally-spritzy notes. Medium body, moderately sweet with candy sugar notes. Some oak flavor. Slight bitterness and subtle hop flavor, nicely balanced. Nice bitter finish with no harshness. A great tripel.

Appropriated this 12 oz bottle at a decent but pricey bottle shop in NYC, glad to have it. Pouring into my tulip shaped ABGB glass, a quite clear, yellow body with a pearlescent white head. The scent is white bread and honey. I drink, spun sugar, meadow, yeast and some spiciness. Some burn, from the bourbon barrels I guess. Very tasty, I approve heartily, better than their regular tripel.
Allagash Curieux;Portland, Maine, United States;Tripel;Allagash Brewing Company;11%ABV. Belgian golden strong ale. Poured out gold. 8�SRM. Nose has aromas of vanilla, coconut, bourbon, oak. There are some sweeet creamy aromas that suggest cream wafers. Yeast aromas suggest banana, clove. Sweet with an almost corn syrup fullness. There are some fruity esters that suggest pear, apple, and orange. Mouthfeel is light and dry. Palate has flavors of honey wafers, references to dates, black ume. Hop flavors are woody, floral. Finish is dry. Overall, a nice dry fruity, sweet, woody ride made interesting by its depth and complexity. To be slowly sampled and appreciated as it evolves in the glass.

Tr�egs Van de Hoorn;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Tr�egs Brewing Company;Originally reviewed: 11/16/10. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a thick, cloudy dark mahogany/amber. The thinnest of heads appears and disappears within seconds. No lace. The nose carries in it notes of alcohol, pale fruits, and molasses. Pretty tamed down though. I imagine this popped more in scent when fresh. Great full-body full of warmth and depth. Carbonation level has stayed fairly consistent over time. Flavors of sweet apples, pear, syrupy pancakes, and a twinge of warming alcohol on the back end. This is quite an easy sipper on this cold drizzly afternoon.
Tr�egs Van de Hoorn;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Tr�egs Brewing Company;A: The beer pours amber in color with a small off-white head. S: A very fruity aroma to this. A bit of grape and cherry, perhaps some plums. Maybe a little bit of metal and lemon. Bready malt and a bit of caramel sweetness. T: Sweet caramel malts with a definite tart fruit character. Some peaches, plums, grapes, and cherries with a bit of a lemon character. A bit too much of a fruit juice thing going on. M: Light bodied with low to medium carbonation. O: This is another one that is beyond its prime, probably not surprisingly.
Tr�egs Van de Hoorn;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Dubbel;Tr�egs Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. Pours a nice dark amber color with a white head and a bit of lacing as it goes down my glass. The nose brings caramel, dark fruits, cherries, and a bit of Belgian spice. Nice intricate nose, and definitely an improvement on the regular Troegenator. The taste focuses on some sweet malt and the Belgian yeast, bringing some really nice flavor combinations forward. Good body with nice spice. A good and interesting brew, but a bit much in the end. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 10-24-2010

The menu said Scratch #34, Abbey Dubbel, but neither RB nor Troegs website list any #34 at all. However, there is a #24 which IS a dubbel and aliases to this beer. I�ll just drop the rating here, which is good enough for me since I�ll not likely ever come across any of these again. Hazy dark amber with sticky khaki head. Aroma is full of standard dubbel yeast and dried fruit notes. Flavor is nicely attenuated and not at all derogatorily sweet. Really nicely done dubbel that could best many of the Belgian standby beers

Moores Perry - Dry (Draught);Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England;Perry;Moores Perry;An excellent offering from a small perry specialist in Gloucestershire. Information on the producer is very scant, but the perry does crop up quite regularly at festivals. Very pale colour with a slight haze. Very juicy pear aroma, with some authentic earthy barnyard notes. Good balance of fruit and tannins on the palate. Dry, but not searingly so. Some perries can seem a bit flabby compared to ciders, but this one has plenty of backbone. One of the best perries I have had. From the barrel at GBBF 2004.

Appalachian Obbies Grand Cru;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);pours gold with very fine, silky white head. Smells of apricots and funky yeast (combo of saison and chimay). Taste is of nectar (super sweet), apricots, and behind the sweetness theres a little bit of grain/cereal. Thick and syrupy, feels like it may be hiding some alcohol due to the high final gravity. Update: watch out for this one though, apparently some of the kegs are grossly under attenuated, or downright unfinished fermenting.
Appalachian Obbies Grand Cru;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);On tap at the ABC brewpub.

Appalachian Obbies Grand Cru;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft at Harrisburg. I am rather surprised at the low rating. Oh well, Belgians are not my forte. Pours golden amber with a white head. Aroma of lemon, wheat malt, and belgian esters. Typical belgian mouthfeel and texture. Flavor of pale wheat malt, honey, and spice. There is a decent amount of sweetness, but not overly sweet or sticky. Moderate bitterness on the finish, joined by some yeasty flavors and a hint of alcohol. I thought this was a respectable attempt at a Belgian. This reminds me of a golden triple, but with less alcohol and bite.
Appalachian Obbies Grand Cru;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft at the Harrisburg brewery. 30-40% opaque light orange and yellow colored body. Huge sugary nose full of perfumy, sugary soap and coriander scents with light yeast esters. Some light spicy ginger as well, but overall it does not smell good at all - plastic and sugar notes far too heavy. Sharp on the tongue, sugary and spicy, extremely cloying and oversweet, then stale and emtpy in the finish. Tastes highly alcoholic, but also full of unfermented sugars. Unclean and disorganized, and difficult to finish.
Appalachian Obbies Grand Cru;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft at the Gettysburg location, July 2006. A hazy orange beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet yeasty with strong notes of fruit. The flavor is very sweet and very fruity, with light notes of yeast mixing in as well as wood, leading to a dry end with the woody notes lingering around. The body is thick.
Appalachian Obbies Grand Cru;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);On tap at Gettysburg location, July 2006. After developing a theme of subtlety in the previous few beers in the sampler, we returned to an earlier theme - namely sweetness - with this one. Too much sweetness for me. Other might see it differently. Hazy orange colour. Heavily spiced, Belgian tripel style with bags of Curacao and orange peel in evidence. This added a touch of sharp bitterness but, all in all, the overriding sweetness detracted from my enjoyment. So, overall, a slight disappointment.

Appalachian Obbies Grand Cru;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Orangey-amber, light white ring.

Soft carbonation, light bodied, not very dry. Good.

Frings Lager;Whangarei, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Brauhaus Frings;On tap at Brauhaus Frings brewpub. Rich gold hue, thin white fine bubbly slowly diminishing head, some lacing. Nice moderate to strong malt aroma with a hint of passion-fruit, honey, smoke, Weetbix. Tastes light sweet, moderately bitter, noticeably sour and with faint salinity with a short duration which I guess makes it more-ish. Very soft carbonation, thin oily texture, dry astringent finish. Very different to any other lager I have had - mostly in a good way. Unusual taste but in a likeable way I suppose.
Frings Lager;Whangarei, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Brauhaus Frings;Draught at the brew pub, a lively pour, a slight haze to the golden appearance with only a filmy head.

Frings Draught;Whangarei, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Brauhaus Frings;Draught at the brew pub, a deep brown colour of an ox-blood hue, with a filmy head. A sweetish caramal malt aroma. The malty palate is sweet, but it is a touch vinegary, suggesting that this might be past its best.
Frings Draught;Whangarei, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Brauhaus Frings;(On tap) Clear, amber golden with an off-white head. Lightly burned and lightly acidic aroma. Light in body with weak notes of nuts and lightly burned malts. Dry finish with a discreet bitterness and again this vague acidity (the brewer tell he tunes the acidity up in his beers during summertime). A very unusual example of a NZ Draught, reminds me more of a Brown Ale although bottom fermented. 090208

Rocky Run Maple Leaf Lemon Wheat;Glen Burnie, Maryland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rocky Run Tap & Grill;"I was a little disappointed when I saw the beer coming -- filtered, not cloudy like I like my wheat. As usual, I drop my lemon in, and take a sip. Turns out I didn�t need the lemon. The ""hint"" of lemon was a good shot of citrus, much more than I expected. This is an excellent summer/spring beer, light and citrusy. Worth the trip out of DC or Baltimore."
Bullfrog Farmhouse Ale;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Bullfrog Brewery;"Sampled as ""Saison"" at State College BrewExpo. This cloudy pale amber beer had a slight wispy pale foamy head, a medium watery body and mild carbonation. It was listed as Saison at the festival, but I was told that it was really just a rename of the Farmhouse Ale. By aroma, there was some nice yeastiness and mild dusty grain notes. Taste was rougher than I had hoped for, but there was definitely a yeasty lemony component and light spices. In all, it was rather tangy, if not actually acidic."

Evans Belgian Strong Ale;Albany, New York, United States;Tripel;C.H. Evans Brewing Company at the Albany Pump Station;"Had on tap at the Albany Pump Station on 12/22/12. It pours a fairly typical cloud orange, exactly what I�d expect given the style. There is a fleeting white head that didn�t last particularly long. This strong ale has an interesting aroma, one that reminded me of sassafras and spice; I actually enjoyed it. The taste is pretty typical of the style, spicy with yeasty esters. Unfortunately, it falls fairly flat. It�s not offensive, but it�s somewhat uninteresting."

Southside Paddy Wagon Pale;Salem, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - English;Southside Speakeasy and Brewpub;Decided to pop into theis Brewpub, probably the least known in Oregon,today. First pint was this. Looked a little darker amber than most of this style,small head and sparce lacing. The aroma was nondescript, but mostly of malts. This is quite a malty pale ale compared to most I have tasted in the PNW,nice though with a small bitter aftertaste of hops. Quite smooth and satisfying on the palate. A nice and unexpected version of an English Pale( reminded me a little of Whitbread).

Redoak Organic Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Appearance/Aroma/Taste/Palate/Overall: 2/6/5/3/11. 330mL bottle from Dan Murphy�s in Sydney ($10 for 4), BB Oct 17. Now the only bottled Redoak beer sold outside their brewpub. Appearance: Hazy golden. Even with a generous pour, this cannot retain a head. Aroma: Malt, traces of stonefruit. Strange plasticine smell (could it be the London ale yeast?). Taste: Malt heavy. A bit of strange funkiness and unexplainable plasticine (more suited to a sour). Does not taste like any other beer but it is still nothing special. Severely lacking hops (even less than 150 Lashes). Almost no bitterness, ends in biscuity malt. Palate: Average body and carbonation. Overall: Not offensive but his has plenty of bad reviews since the 2000s. Perhaps Redoak kept it bland to appeal to the masses? $9.50 for 425mL at their brewpub is a rip off. Luckily this is not their best beer (try their Global IPA instead).
Redoak Organic Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;On tap at Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe, pours a cloudy yellow with a small white head.

Redoak Organic Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"330ml bottle. Poured into a stemmed larger glass. Oh what a disappointment. Mostly because of the hype around Redoak - ""Australia�s most awarded brewery"" - well no awards for this one. Aroma was nice and surprisingly malty. Appearance was poor with very little head no matter how lively the pour and it settled to between barely a ring of foam to nothing (I had three). Colour was a dark straw to golden colour. A little cloudy depending upon whether you get the sediment out or not. Taste was mild. No hops, no bitterness, minimal malt - just bland. Not horrible, but nothing to notice. Palate was short. I�ve had better macro beers, and this was reminiscent of an average home brew. Will try others from Redoak, because it can only be up from here (I hope). Update: 20/7/2016 Had this on tap at the brew pub / brew cafe. Same opinion - even though this was straight from the tap. The biggest thing to note though is that this is unfortunately the best of their range."

Redoak Organic Hefeweizen;Sydney, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Tasting from Jan� 2009. Very subtle lemon zest and lemon/lime cordial nose, a little hit of clove and dank liquor. Appearance has merit, though it is very pale. Lots of furious carbonation at work amid its sandy yellow body. A rocky snow-white cap, two inches thick, crowns it off. A little sour and quite tangy in the mouth. Pronounced wheat flavour, a little vanilla and lemon acidity down the sides towards a wad of clove-like and smoky phenols in the back. It is pasty in mouthfeel and has a touch of chlorine in the swallow which is thankfully short, crisp. Featherweight in body and with high fizz, almost biting on the tongue. Just a little too much of what I don�t want in a wheat beer here. Hmmm! (33cL, No date stamp, The Beer Store Morley)
Redoak Organic Hefeweizen;Sydney, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottle @ home Pours a clear amber, which is odd since it should be cloudy, with a weak white head. The aroma is not as strong as one might like, but is mostly of fruit and wheat. The flavour is the saving grace of this beer, being refreshing and balanced with a bitter hint. The mouthfeel is slightly fizzy and has a thin/medium body. The biggest shame about this beer is that it could have been so much better than it is.

Redoak Organic Hefeweizen;Sydney, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;This was called Organic Hefeweizen so I suppose its the same thing. Didn�t ahve the aroma profile I was expecting from a Hefe style wheat beer. Lacked the banana, clove ester aromas I�ve had from true German Hefes. Palate was thin and a bit watery. On a night when we tasted maybe a dozen beers this was one of the lowlights. A little dissapointing.

Redoak Blackberry Hefeweizen;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;16-Feb-11 (250-ml sample bottle: Free bottle for stewarding the 2008 World Beer Cup in San Diego, CA) Ordinarily, a fruity wheat beer would cellar very poorly, but this one is not your ordinary example. This is unexpected tart, and though it�s not a tartness from a malevolent infection, it doesn�t come close to matching the brewery�s commercial description, so something is probably amiss here. For the most part, it�s just a tart berry character and what seems to be a souring agent, and though simple, it�s still reasonably pleasant. Unfortunately, there is little else going on until the finish when the berry wears off the palate and the beer tastes like a generic wheat beer. This recipe may intend for the base to have the traditional clove and banana esters, but none of that comes out. The somewhat musty nose is mostly tart berry and little else. Weight is light, the mouthfeel is dry and moderately acidic, and the carbonation is medium. In the glass, the beer is red-orange in color with only a slight haze, and the short, fizzy head dissipates rapidly. Overall, whether intentionally sour or not, it�s not bad as a sour beer, but it�s clearly not a hefeweizen.
Redoak Blackberry Hefeweizen;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Pretty nice, it�s sour but it�s definitely a blackberry sourness, not that it is off. Not the best Red Oak, but this will do.

Redoak Blackberry Hefeweizen;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Very Carbonated! wasn�t paying attention with my first pour,and after the first 30ml ended up with a glass full of foam, put it aside for 5 mins to let it calm down. Blackberry aroma without any of the banana/clove that i expected. Flavour of blackberry and wheat malt and a strong tartness, some yeast but not as much as i hoped. Though having not yet had a fruit lambic (lindemans peach not counted) i think this cant be far off one.
Redoak Framboise Froment;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;The aroma is very powerful, with smells of blackberries and raspberries pleasantly filling the nose.

Stunning nose of fresh raspberries but, just like the fruit itself, I�m not that enamoured once it is in the mouth. Very dry, tart and sour. Watery. Needs a little sweetness to balance it. Maybe a fuller mouthfeel. Or less carbonation. Tastes better than it reads though, looking back there I feel a bit harsh!
Redoak Framboise Froment;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;[Bottle] shared by STLWill. Pours a hazy peach with a medium beige head of large bubbles. Aroma is raspberry, rhubarb, fruit sugars, and light tartness. Flavor is light raspberry, lightly tart and acidic, and quite fizzy.
Redoak Framboise Froment;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottle sample thanks to STLWill. Appearance was very light pink, almost like a white zinfandel wine. Aroma was raspberries and some tartness. Very light flavor of tart boozy raspberries and finished dry. I like this one a lot!
Redoak Medium Strength Lager;Sydney, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Isn�t it great when you have one of these? As if we are going to be anything but underwhelmed. When you see the words �easy drinking�, �light bodied� and �yet a lower alcohol content� the waaa, waaa, waaa, waaa goes off in your head. Thanks for catering to my changing habits, may they never if this is the offering to assuage my maturing or more responsible tastes. No need to wax on about colour, head, mouthfeel etc etc just to say how pleased I am to have spent about 5 bucks on 250ml of swill. Hmm, like the religious program hour of power...... mill of swill......yeah I like it. Aah, the concept not the beer.
Redoak Bock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Tap. Deep reddish amber Small white head. Aroma of Biscuit grass vanilla. Big ringing clean maltiness. Taste is along same lines w A little stewed fruit that maybe shouldn�t be there. Just enough bitterness for a finish. Some spice in the grass at the end. Very solid drop.
Redoak Bock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;2011 release on draught at Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe in Sydney (6.9%ABV). Appears red-brown in the glass with a tan head of good duration and lacing. Nose is rich dark roasted malts with burnt sugar and hints of cherries/plums together with an alcoholic presence. Rich syrupy medium-to-full bodied palate with a sweet malty tongue and light hop presence. A sipper for a cold winter�s day.
Redoak Bock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Tasting from Jan� 2009. Produces a ruddy chestnut, not quite bright. The carbonation is tight and very fine. Huge toque blanche dons it rising a good inch from the brim of the glass and holds. Dense, the head needs to be chewed off to get to the beer below. It looks good! Aroma is interesting - dusty cocoa, tree bark and trodden, fermenting cherries, a little weedy and earthy, soil-like. Down hill from there in the mouth. Burnt caramel and burnt grain husks, some kelp and rust, a tannic astringency in and around the swallow and soft alcohol burn. Rust and tea-like tannins coming through in the swallow too, notes of spent grain also. It is so light in body. Nothing works with this. It would have been so much better if I didn�t have to drink it. Disappointing as it starts off so good! One for the re-rate pile..... (33cL, No date stamp, The Beer Store Morley)
Redoak Bock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottle. Pours lovely dark copper with an off-white head that shrinks to surface cover pretty quickly. Aroma is a little bit light but has notes of toffee, molasses and brown sugar. Flavour, like the aroma, is quite sweet, but not sickly, and has a lot in common with the aroma but with a slight burnt note, like burnt sugar, as well as the subtlest hint of hops. Very pleasant but definitely on the sweet side.
Redoak Bock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Thick frothy head on a red/brown pour good carbonation.Aroma,hint cramel,roast flavour,very nice hops,fruit and melon tastes,a good lager for a cool night,finish dry and melon taste.
Redoak Bock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"330ml botte from local bottlo. A sort of odd woody chocolate and red wine like aroma. Pours a headless ruby-brown body. Mouth is suprisingly full and creamy, despite appearences. Rich malts dominate the flavour, roasted, burnt, almost even a charcol like smokiness at times. Slightly berry fruit finish with a subtle lingering dry bitterness. Seems like the kind of beer you could sit back and sip at for ages; too tasty though!"
Redoak Bock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottled, whilst in Sydney, Aus. Bright, chessnut body. Medium head. Tainted malt and boiled veg flavour. It�s fair to say that my first beer from Redoak was not that great. Will need to get down to the brew pub in the city.
Redoak Bock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;(Bottle) Clear mahogany brown with a medium sized head that was around for a little while. Smells deliciously of roasted malts, sort of meaty, but a really lovely malty aroma. Flavour is a bit salty, helping it taste a bit like a roast with gravy. Chewy palate and a medium to full body. This is a very tasty beer, and better than I remember it being when I had it on tap. Makes me want to head back down to the the brew-pub.
Redoak Bock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;on tap at redoak. ruby colour with a decently frothy, white head. definitely some strawberry jam in the aroma. flavour reminded me of rhubarb and custard (the dessert, not the tv show) with a slight earthiness that hinted at boiled vegies. not much german stuff happening but it was ok anyway
Redoak Bock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Deep red body with a light tan head. The head lasted the distance but left little lacing and didn�t impress much in the appearance. Aroma of malt and dried fruit. Light enough in body to drink quickly with flavours of dried fruit, spice and pepper. Tastes alright just doesn�t really turn me on but certainly could drink more than one and would recommend others to give it a try.
Redoak Oatmeal Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;On tap at the brewpub Clear dark mahogany with a small beige head and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malts and coffee. Flavors of roasted malts, grainy, coffee and chocolate Nice, thin mouthfeel
Redoak Oatmeal Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Very serviceable, if a little oily to my palate. Nice and smooth with a short creamy finish.
Redoak Oatmeal Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;I love a good oatmeal stout. This was dark with a perfect white head. Strong coffee, chocolate and molasses. Lovely toasty malts and caramel flavors, I felt it was well balanced. A tad sweeter than I expected and a little thin in the finish but all in all a very nice oatmeal stout.
Redoak Oatmeal Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Had this one during my holiday in Australia april/may 2009. Black colored brew. Toasted malty aroma. Oatmeal, citric, toasted malts, vinous character.
Redoak Oatmeal Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Draught at Redoak Brewpub, Sydney. Once again served too cold...I let this one sit for a few minutes. Pours dark brown with a small off-white head. Notes of chocolate, molasses, nuts and toffee. The flavour is chocolate, molasses, nuts and toffee. Sweet and sticky mouthfeel but well balanced. Sweet, malty finish. A nice stout but serving conditions may have let this one down in the ratings.
Redoak Oatmeal Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;I had a lovely couple of sessions at the Red Oak in Sydney. Unfortunately I lost my notes but I can report that all the beers I tried were perfect examples of their respective style. The aroma, flavour, mouthfeel, malt and hoppyness is exactly what you would imagine from reading standard guidelines. Very well crafted and very tasty, but a bit to predictable to be outstanding.
Redoak Oatmeal Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Vegemite black in colour with toffee coloured head. Chocolate aroma with metalic follow though. Fruity cascadehop mouthfeel, thin body.
Redoak Oatmeal Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Pitch black color. Light brown head. Coffee, treacles,molasses and toffee notes. Very nice. However, the body is thin and unbalanced with dark fruit and chocolate cake. Chocolately finish. Starts nice, but goes nowhere fast.
Redoak Oatmeal Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Tried on tap at Redoak back in march after one of their beer dinners. Almost black body with a light tan head that hung around for a fair while. A little grainy on the aroma then followed by coffee notes. Taste was pretty much similar although there was some burnt characters in there as well.
Redoak Oatmeal Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Draught at the Redoak. Waited a good 20 odd minutes before consumption, it could have done with longer. Arrived black with a average size light brown head which lasted quite well. There was a robust aroma of burnt coffee like malts with some dark chocolate and hints of raisins. Flavor was mainly espresso coffee with hints of molasses and light notes of dark chocolate in the back. Medium bodied with soft carbonation, a creamy mouthfeel and a finish which was a little short.
Redoak Belgian Chocolate Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Dark chocolate aroma. Very black colour with poor head. Dark chocolate flavor with long aftertaste. Heavy body with high to medium carbonation.
Redoak Belgian Chocolate Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;29th December 2009 ChrisO �Night Of The Gaylords� tasting. Cloudy dark brown beer. A little blackcurrant in the malty nose. Unsweet chocolate and malt. Something chemical as well. Doesn�t hang together. Not nice!
Redoak Belgian Chocolate Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Really disappointing. Dark in colour. No head. Really thin. Heaps of citrus and blueberries. Bit of dark chocloate but nothing that jumps out at you.
Redoak Belgian Chocolate Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Really moreish quality beer, let down by a thin body. Very smooth with the oat and with a bit more meat this could be great. A real chocolate stout - could be a world beater with a little tweaking.
Redoak Belgian Chocolate Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottle 50cl. @ Chris O�s Night of the Gaylords. Clear dark brown color with a average, creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, beige head. Aroma is moderate malty, roasted, chocolate, blackcurrant. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and moderate bitter with a long duration, light sour, soy sauce notes. Body is light to medium, texture is watery to oily, carbonation is soft. [20091229]
Redoak Belgian Chocolate Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;250mL bottle. Pours an opaque dark red-black with a brown head that subsides pretty quickly. Aroma is dried fruit with some roastiness and chocolate. The flavour is sour with faint chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. On the light side of medium bodied with soft carbonation and an astringent, slightly bitter finish. The Overall score is low on account of the price.
Redoak Belgian Chocolate Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottled@The Chriso Gaylord Tasting. Deep amber colour, small head. Aroma is some wood, chocolate, mild roasted malts as well as some strange sourish/bitter notes. Flavour is quite much the same. Not to fond of this one...
Redoak Belgian Chocolate Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;A Mes rate. Bottle at Chris O�s Night of the Gaylords. Brown and erm... Yup. Slight U.S. chocolate (not at all Belgian) and plenty of blackcurrant. Cheap advent calendar stuff with an odd sour note. Not great.
Redoak Belgian Chocolate Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottle at the Chriso Gaylord tasting 09. Black, lasting tan head. Choc and blackcurrant on aroma. Musty, oxidised, not huge choc anywhere. Just a bit maybe. Not very stouty, not very choccy. Some sourness.
Redoak Belgian Chocolate Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;250ml bottle. Black. Fizzes like Coke and leaves no head at all. Nose has dark chocolate and some apples. Fizzy mouthfeel (weird for an oatmeal stout). Powdery cocoa and coffee. Slightly tart apple juice/ coriander (leaf) finish. Poor.
Redoak Belgium Choc-Cherry Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"Took me a while to get to this one. Good nose; furry, dustry, musty chocolate. Pongy whiff from the cherry. Good looking beer; very very dark brown and a thin coffee-coloured head. Palate shows a lot of restraint but is quite classy. Chocolate and mint, albeit mild, with a very clear cherry impact - sour and tangy - before a dry and slighty roasty finish. Better than expected."
Redoak Belgium Choc-Cherry Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;bottled, at the brewpub. pretty dark, damn close to black. aroma of cherry cordial, cocoa powder and porridge. quite pleasant if a little muted, full mouthfeel, hints of cherry ripe and czech porridge, not too bad
Redoak Belgium Choc-Cherry Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;In the bottle at the brewpub. Pours dark brown to black with nearly no head whatsoever. If you swirl the glass vigorously, you can manufacture a rapidly-dying dark tan head. Has a chocolate candy bar aroma. The body is a bit thin for a ridiculously expensive beer. At warming, the aroma produces a bit of raspberry, but I never get cherries from this. An applesauce flavor emerges in the warmed beer. Finishes with a faint roastedness and some cherry tartness to the flavor. Overpriced and under produced. The beer at this place is by no means the best in Australia.
Redoak Belgium Choc-Cherry Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottled. Dark black. Rich aroma of raspberry & cream liqueur, coffee and chocolate. Sweet with clean, rounded mouthfeel. Flavour is all milky chocolate with rum-raisin. Toffeeish finish. Strange, but fairly good.
Redoak Belgium Choc-Cherry Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottle at Redoak: Black to choc-brown with no head (cocoa fats I presume). Huge dark, bitter chocolate aromas with some background sweet, and slightly candied cherries that really pulls you in. Some malty and caramel undertones. Salty bitter chocolate flavours with roastyness singing a theme tune and some coffee notes as a late encore. This has lots going for it, but it is really lacking in body and depth. Mid-palate it falls, badly. Otherwise this is a good example of combining stout, chocolate, and fruit. Fundamentally, however, it is a week beer. Sampled with highlandlad.
Redoak Belgium Choc-Cherry Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Loved the smell of this, but it doesn�t live up to that promise. I find all the Redoak stouts a bit puny and this is no exception. Looked so-so - jet-black with a thin head and poor retention. Terrific aroma. Where the chocolate stout is all cocoa powder, this has a rich cherry liqueur character that is very inviting. Nice strong bitter chocolate notes and a real intensity to it. Not so good on the tongue: the palate is thin and it�s a bit dull and flat. The flavour can�t match the intensity of the aroma but it�s still pretty good: Bourneville chocolate, faint cherry and some vinous notes. Falls off a bit in the finish. Good but not great. (Bottle at brewpub, with Aarleks)
Redoak Belgium Choc-Cherry Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;OK, it goes like this. First the Oatmeal Stout costs $6 for the 250ml bottle. Then the addition of Belgian chocolate adds another 25% to the cost to bring it up to $7.50. Another trip to the mixmaster adds only 20% to the cost this time as it comes out at a very reasonable $9 for a 250ml sample!!! I wouldn�t mind if the snifter glass came with it but no dice. So what is this beer? Hmm, tastes like a chocolate stout with the addition of some cherry syrup. I think a homebrewer would have better economies of scale if they just tipped a bag of cherry ripes into the fermenter with their basic stout recipe. I really applaud the sentiment but not the wank of the method and price point.
Redoak Belgium Choc-Cherry Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottle. I preffered their regular Oatmeal and Belgium chocolate stout to this. Chocolate powder and glace cherry on the nose, some coffee. I think the cherry flavour was a little to sweet for me, and it felt a little articficial. They tried something different, which is good i suppose.
Redoak Belgium Choc-Cherry Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;At Redoak. Clear, not quite black. Head not very good but I guess chocolate will do that. Beautiful rich dark chocolate aroma - really good - is let down by a pretty boring tasting soft stout flavour. Pretty thin, little chocolate and lacking any real stouty guts. No real cherry character whatsoever, though there�s the faintest sourness. The chocolate also gives a bad, powdery mouthfeel which I didn�t care for. $9 for 250mL of beer which is just another one of their beers with chocolate and cherries added really makes me think that Redoak is really having a laugh at people like me who feel compelled to try everything. Still I�m surprised eczematic rated it so low - maybe it was the company...
Redoak Belgium Choc-Cherry Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;the chocolate stout with a very small amount of sweet (not even sour) cherry flavour. dark brown, no head, viscous and one-dimensionally sweet with virtually no stoutiness at all apart from some mild chocolate malt. not my sort of beer.
BARS M38;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tower Brewery;Dog & Bone. Apparantly a Bass clone. A trial for the possibility of Tower brewing Bass in the future. Sulphur and vinegar nose. Very lively. Watery and full of flaws. Bad.
Keller Lager;Cluj-Napoca, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ursus Breweries (Asahi);Not much to write home about but better than no beer. Sour afetr ttaste with a thin palate. Somewhat fishy aroma & a definite bitter aftertaste.
Keller Lager;Cluj-Napoca, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ursus Breweries (Asahi);(Bottle 50 cl) Fully golden with impurities. Decent and quite dense head. Mild, discreet bitterness and the typical Romanian metallic edge. Are all their brewing vats rusty or what? SAB Miller this time - most Romanian breweries have fallen victim to the multinationals. 120803
Keller Lager;Cluj-Napoca, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ursus Breweries (Asahi);Bottled, 10.2% Plato. Very pale, light floral aroma, fruity and slightly sour in the end. Forgettable.
Bergenbier Bruna;Baia Mare, Romania;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Proberco SA (InBev);Neither a dunkel, nor a bock - something in between. Deep brown colour, strong coffee aroma, alcoholic malty palate - interesting but almost undrinkable.
Cozla Beer;Piatra Neamt, Romania;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;S.C. Cozla Productie SRL;In Duvel-style bottles. Dark amber colour, quite high bubbly head. Evident floral hoppy aroma, yeasty, hoppy palate with hints of iron and smoke. 11% o. gravity.
Royal Cozla;Piatra Neamt, Romania;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;S.C. Cozla Productie SRL;"Bottle 500 ml. An ""European"" version of basic Cozla with more neutral aroma and palate. Still nicely hopped but the taste is less fresh and yeasty."
Fulger Fulbier;Bragadiru, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;S.C. Fulger S.A.;Bottled. Pale straw colour, small head. Artificial plastic aroma, watery and tasteless. I thought this was one of the worst beers I�d tried, but then I opened a bottle of Fulbier Bucur...
Fulger Bucur;Bragadiru, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;S.C. Fulger S.A.;It�s both easy and difficult to rate this beer. It�s simply the worst beer I�ve ever met. You haters of BMC, malt liquors and chili beers: you just don�t know what bad beer is. Bottled, poisonous orange colour and no head to write of. Aroma and taste of dustbin filled with vegetables and left for a week in the sun. Horrible. Urine.
Scattor Rock Wilhays Tor;Exeter, Devon, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Scattor Rock Brewery;Cask at Devon Beers Festival, Royal Oak, Ockbrook.

Kuhnhenn Bock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Cloudy red-amber with a smnall light tran head. The aroma is lightly stale malt, tobacco even. Some dark fruit and sweetness also. The flavor is alcohol, sweet fruity malts, caramel, and a bit of staleness, even maybe medicinal. Medium dry, attenuated finsih.
Kuhnhenn Bock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"draft at brewery. light color, for a bock. i think perhaps others are reading too much into this beer; it seemed rather straightforward to me. aside from the pleasant malt notes, some typical lagery scents--lightly yeasty. very clean, but not too complex. some dark fruits and malts, but otherwise not spectacular."
Kuhnhenn Bock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Kuhnhenn Brewing;2004 draught 12/04 at the brewery. Pours a dark brown with some barely perceptible burgundy/maroon tinges and a strong light tan head. Aroma is slightly weak, in retrospect, after drinking the beer. Some light caramel, sour yeast and prune notes. What the aroma lacks, is made up for by the flavor. Havent had a regular gravity beer this flavorful in a long time. Immediately washes the palate with sticky, chewy caramel, toffee, prunes, raisins, a touch of tobacco perhaps. Ends on a drier chocolate and yeast mix. Clean lager finish, a touch of thinning, that belies the huge flavor up front. Medium body, moderate carbonation, low hops apparency. I definitely had two pints of this while I was there.

Sweetwater Happy Ending Imperial Stout;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sweetwater Brewing Company;This could be the hoppiest IPS that I have sampled. First tried this at a beerfest last month, then sampled it on cask with 3 lbs of hops added. That was almost too hoppy. This is actually balanced pretty well. Dry-hopped adds some clean fr for us, because it has taken until this summer for us to get set up in our new brewery. Dark black appearance with a mocha head. 9% IPS makes for easier drinking though. Has potential. 2nd sample was a single bottle, but I would have no problem getting a 6 of this.
Sweetwater Happy Ending Imperial Stout;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sweetwater Brewing Company;Bottle. Deep opaque brown-black body, medium dense tan head. Roast, toasted crackers, and oxidized hops nose. Body roasty with cocoa, biscuit, and faded, oxidized hops lending an unappealing flabbiness to the beer.

The nose presented some roastiness, with mocha notes, dark fruit as grape & cherry, with a touch of vinous nature. Fairly full in body, with okay carbonation, the taste was similar, with roast & wood, earthy bitterness, and presentable alcohol participation.

Rock Bottom Minneapolis Saison Fergus;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;ABR 2007 Gold colrow with a little bit of herbal and barnyard funk. Nice funk and herb body.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Saison Fergus;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Pours a hazy straw-amber, topped by a good inch of tightly-packed white foam. Good head retention, excellent lacing. Green citrus and a honey-malty aroma. Nice blend of flavors � honeymalt, grapefruit, pineapple, and peach up front. It starts out on the sweet side, and then ends quite dry and even tart, full of citrus juice acidic fruitiness, grapefruit pith, some spice (from the strain of yeast, I think), and a touch of grassy hop bitterness. Now that this beer has been out for a while, I think the pineapple and peach fruitiness is less noticeable than it was originally. Medium bodied and nicely carbonated, the alcohol isn�t noticeable in the flavor or mouthfeel, but it does sneak up on you after a couple of mug club pints.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Saison Fergus;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Hazy light gold with a grayish head. Nose very weedy and herbal, with sourness and barnyard character. Oddly minty as well. Flavor grassy, minty with sugars and a tingly finish.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Saison Fergus;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;"First let me say I am very pleased that Rock Bottom would attempt this style. This beer was easily the most unique at the ABR �05. They got the aroma right; a friend described it as barnyard. The beer is yellow, and the flavor is dominated by grapefruit. They did the aroma right; the flavor needs some work. Fairly dry finish. Gets extra points for effort; will get more with refinement. A good start."
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Saison Fergus;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;BLBF. Cloudy orange tine, no head. Lemon, apricot and cherris in the aroma. Very hexaned flavor, but also florally rich and tasty. Lucious and fairly complex. Finish is almost hop dry.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Saison Fergus;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;From a growler: Crisp, golden apple appearance, short but long-lived layer of foam floats on top. A sweet and mellow symphony in the nose, at first sharply citric, then roundly fruity, lemon, orange, apple, grape, a bit of must in the center, straw, hey, then the spices kick in, coriander, cardamom?, a whisper of bitterness...very nice. Subtle, spohisticated, urger the imbiber on, to taste, or so I do... crisp and hoppy, but tames down and becomes smoothness itself. Nice malty cushion, plush with fruit and spice all throughout the flavor. Brisk and refreshing with continual rewards through every succeeding sip. Makes me wish it were hotter out, the better to appreciate it�s light body, yet subtle and refreshing taste.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Saison Fergus;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;2004 Autumn Brew Review: Rich Golden. Nice Brew. Floral. Spice and some Hops... Very Good.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Saison Fergus;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;"2004 ABR. There was some buzz about this beer at the Autumn Brew Review, so I made it a point to go sample it. Faint, honey lager aroma with some wheat and some banana notes. Cloudy dark gold in color; small, off-white head. Not much head. Like a wheat beer. I am not overly familiar with the saison style, but there is less citrus evident in this beer than in the other Saison I�ve had, 3Floyds Rabbid Rabbit. Kudos to Rock Bottom for creating an offering in a more obscure style."
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Saison Fergus;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Autumn Brew Review 2004.

Guinness Extra Smooth Stout (Ghana);Kumasi, Ghana;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Guinness Ghana Breweries;Too Heavy......... Too thick......... Order it have a sip.......... and let it sit...... While you drink a beer that won�t taint your palate for the night.........
Guinness Extra Smooth Stout (Ghana);Kumasi, Ghana;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Guinness Ghana Breweries;I haven�t enjoyed one of these since 1985, but I remember this one fondly. When my Ghanaian hosts wanted to impress guests, this is what they served. Like any other Guinness Stout, it is almost black, with a chocolate and malt flavor. It was often poured into a large calabash of sweet palm wine for a concoction I�ve longed for ever since.
Guinness Extra Smooth Stout (Ghana);Kumasi, Ghana;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Guinness Ghana Breweries;I had this beer while on a medical mission in Ghana a number of years ago, but I thought I�d rate it now (one more country to check off!). Obviously you are not going to find a brewing miracle in West Africa, but when its over 40 degrees Celcius with 90% humidity, if it even remotely tastes like beer and is cold, then it does the job just fine. This one is a poorly made foreign stout that became a revered after-work treat, along with Star and ABC pale lager. As an example of foreign stout, it is below average (Sinha is a beautiful example of an excellent foreign stout). However, the atmosphere of Ghanaian hospitality, hot groundnut stew with fufu, and the contented feeling of having finished a hard days work are what elevate this rating to what it is.
Guinness Extra Smooth Stout (Ghana);Kumasi, Ghana;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Guinness Ghana Breweries;A plain tasting Guinness. Very thin mouthfeel with strange bitter notes. I�d rather have the original.
Guinness Extra Smooth Stout (Ghana);Kumasi, Ghana;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Guinness Ghana Breweries;Black coloured. This is an extremely thin stout with notes of apples in the aroma and in the flavour.
Guinness Extra Smooth Stout (Ghana);Kumasi, Ghana;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Guinness Ghana Breweries;Pitch black beer with a foamy tan head. Sweet malty and buttery aroma with a roasted tone. Unfortunately the butter tone is a little too penetrating. Also butter notes in the flavor along with sweet malt and sugar. Some citrus also. Soft and rather cloying. Although it is far from the best Guinness I have tasted I don�t find it as bad as Jens and Mads!
Guinness Extra Smooth Stout (Ghana);Kumasi, Ghana;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Guinness Ghana Breweries;Bottled: Pitch black coloured. Huge brown head. Buttery malt aroma. Vague roastyness. Is very sour in the flavour. Some malt and roastyness is present, but is subdued by the sourness. Ver light bittter in the end. Thanks to Jeppe for sharing.
Guinness Extra Smooth Stout (Ghana);Kumasi, Ghana;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Guinness Ghana Breweries;An opaque black beer with a chocolate brown head. The aroma contains notes of plastic as well as roasted malt - and so does the flavor. The plastic really ruins the beer.

Koulu Hops;Turku, Finland;Brown Ale;Panimoravintola Koulu;The taste is not very strong but it�s pleasant anyway. Slightly fruity and sweet. The smell is nice.
Koulu Hops;Turku, Finland;Brown Ale;Panimoravintola Koulu;Draught at brewpub. Clear copper, small pale head. A little fruity and bubblegummy aroma, mild herbal hops and strangely, some liver. Dry malt syrupy flavor, glove, slight liquorice, brewing mash and liver. Light to medium bodied, average carbonation. Very stuffy beer with strange off-flavors, what kind of a season brew you call this?
Koulu Hops;Turku, Finland;Brown Ale;Panimoravintola Koulu;(Draught at Maltainen Monni on 2008-04-19) Red and clear. Very small head. Malts in nose. Medium and bit dry palate. Quite sweet taste contains some hop bitterness. A bit boring.

Koulu Hops;Turku, Finland;Brown Ale;Panimoravintola Koulu;Why in the world has this beer been named Hops, a better name would be Malts. The color is nice red/amber. Almost no flavor, quite malty in the taste. I wouldn�t call this a Brown Ale, more of a Bitter or a Pale Ale.
Koulu Hops;Turku, Finland;Brown Ale;Panimoravintola Koulu;Draught at the brewpub. Amber color with small head. Malty, caramelly and toffeish aroma. Malty and caramelly flavor with slightly toasty, toffeish and raisiny notes. Chewy mouthfeel. Low bitterness. Unfortunately was served ice gold.
Koulu Hops;Turku, Finland;Brown Ale;Panimoravintola Koulu;Draught@skolan. Semi dark in colour with a minor white head. The aroma is malty and hoppy, sweet. The flavour is sweetly hoppy with a semi dry aftertaste. Not one of their best brews.
Koulu Hops;Turku, Finland;Brown Ale;Panimoravintola Koulu;Draught at the brewery in March, 2007. (Fresh batch!) Pours a clear copper colour, with a thick, creamy off-white head. Sweetish malt aroma with a hint of alcohol and hops. Creamy, sweet malts and bitter hops combine nicely in surprisingly smooth, creamy flavor. Perhaps a hint of toffee and vanilla. Bitter, alcoholic finish and aftertaste. Oily mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation. Wow. I didn�t like this brew much the first time I tried it back in 2005, but it�s certainly improved a great deal since then. Lovely.
Koulu Hops;Turku, Finland;Brown Ale;Panimoravintola Koulu;"(Draught) Clear, dark amber color with a small, firm head. Somewhat roasty and sweet, toffeeish aroma with strawberry hints. Roasted-malty, toffeeish flavor. Medium-bodied, hefty-carbonated, sticky-sugary palate. Not much ""hops"" in this one, but quite a bearable brew."
Tuorlan F�ri Olut;Turku, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ciderhouse;"Old notes. ""Sweet fudge"" I can read from the notes. Other line says no head."
Tuorlan F�ri Olut;Turku, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ciderhouse;Bottle from Tbone, thanks! Light amber color. Hardly any head. Cherry sweets and butter in the aroma. Low on carbon. Cherry sweets in the slightly sour flavor. Probably infected, maybe intentionally, but I like the result. The beer almost tastes like a young foxy lambic.
Tuorlan F�ri Olut;Turku, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ciderhouse;330 ml. Deep golden color, wispy white head. Malty aroma. Watery malt flavor. Light body, light carbonation. Where�s the rest of the beer?
Tuorlan F�ri Olut;Turku, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ciderhouse;First of the Tuorlan beers I tried and it was quite positive experience. Nothing special though. Quite soft and slightly sour. watery. later I find out that all the three tuorlan beers seem to be the same.
Tuorlan F�ri Olut;Turku, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ciderhouse;0,33 l bottle. Golden color, little head. Nose is rather sour and malty. Flavor is also malty but quite watery. Not that great.
Tuorlan F�ri Olut;Turku, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ciderhouse;A 0.33L bottle. Pale head. Mild malty nose. Pale golden yellow colour. Mild slightly sour taste. At end some hoppiness.
Tuorlan F�ri Olut;Turku, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ciderhouse;330 ml bottle. Finland. Pale golden colour with thin head. Sweet aroma with some caramel and yeast. Flavour is more yeasty. Feels like it�s not quite ready yet. Bit watery and flat.
Tuorlan F�ri Olut;Turku, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ciderhouse;(Draught at Puutorin Vessa on 2008-08-29) Golden. Clear. Small white head. Light nose with bit of malty aroma. Light and dry palate with lot of carbonation. Bitterness, hint of grapefruit and tiny bit of sweetness.
Tuorlan F�ri Olut;Turku, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ciderhouse;Bottle 0.33 l from brewery. Golden, quickly fading white head. Nose is pretty strongly buttery, spicy hoppy and malty. Flavor is pils like bitter hoppiness, some butterness with nicely flavored malts. I would say this is a bohemian pils in all it�s butterness and bitterness. Messy and a bit unbalanced compared to Urquell and likes, but this is pretty attractive. Feels like a true handicraft beer.
Tuorlan F�ri Olut;Turku, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ciderhouse;Draught @ Puutorin Vessa, Turku. Deep golden, foamy pale head. Grainy malty nose, little citric seedy hops. Malty and sourish flavor, quite spritzy. Seedy, a bit citric bitterness. Somehow it�s got slight Urquell-vibe. Medium bodied, nice round palate. Nose is dull and overall a bit unclean, but at least it manages to be refreshing.
Heavy Seas Peg Leg;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;On tap at Heavy Seas Alehouse (Arlington, VA). Opsque black body with an average, lasting, beige creamy head. Robust, well balanced malty/hoppy taste with roasty, chocolate, and liquorice hints. Alcohol is well hidden. Its strong malty taste carries roasted coffee and hoppy notes. Ends with a long bitter/roasty finish. Good stuff.
Heavy Seas Peg Leg;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;A heavy stout with strong and pungent flavor, not a friend if you�re keen on Kilkenny or Guinness but worth a try, defiantly knock you around
Heavy Seas Peg Leg;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Cold brown bottle on a random Tuesday. Decent imperial stout but not the best. Color is ok.
Heavy Seas Peg Leg;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Bottle pour. Dark, dark brown with mocha head. Straight ahead coffee aroma. Nice coffee bitter taste with hints of dark chocolate. Creamy finish. Typical conservative profile.
Heavy Seas Peg Leg;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;"From a bottle shared from a mix pack - this ""dry imperial stout"" pours an almost jet black color with a nice dark khaki head, looks like freshly brewed espresso. Aroma features heavily roast malts with notes of chocolate and smoky tobacco. Flavor follows with a predominant roasted maltiness with chocolate and espresso accents. Finish has a bitterness derived from the roasted malts and also some English hops, with an aftertaste of some bittersweet chocolate. Surprisingly light-medium bodied texture. Overall a well-done imperial stout that doubles down on the complex roasty malt flavors to distinguish itself."
Heavy Seas Peg Leg;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;A great first impression. Pouring opaque black with light brown head. Flavor is complex and satisfying, though the texture is thin. Yum ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Heavy Seas Peg Leg;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Deep dark brown beer with a thick frothy beige head. Nose of unsweetened cocoa, light balsamic vinegar, and mocha. Flavor of black strap molasses, medium roast coffee, and a slight hint of black cherry. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for an imperial stout, but the flavor is there. Solid beer.
Heavy Seas Peg Leg;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Even though this is an IPS, it doesn't have that super-strong alcohol feel to it like a 9-10% does. Allows the chocolate malt and coffee flavors to stand out a bit more. My favorite stouts (flavor-wise) seem to be in this 7-8% range. The flavor is also a little roasty and/or smokey. Pours a medium thick black color. Still a heavy beer, but not super super heavy. All of these IPSs are starting to blend in my memory, so this doesn't really stand out amongst them all, but still a quality overall brew. Reminds me of North Coast's Old Rasputin, with more coffee and not as strong.
Heavy Seas Peg Leg;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Thought I had reviewed this, guess not, black color, nose is ok with black licorice, some toffee n anise, black ink aromas as well, mouthfeel is ok, fairly smooth n roasts for the higher abv, decent imperial stout that has some body, slight burnt nut finish..I was looking for a higher octane abv offering for a 1 and done at a bar, this seemed like it fill the bill at a decent price per bottle, can't say I was impressed by this, decent...
Heavy Seas Peg Leg;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Stout - Imperial;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Pours thick black with thin head. Aroma is chocolate, dried fruit and sweetbread. Taste is plum, chocolate and caramel, warming to roast. Finish is smooth sweet coffee. A really good stout.

Lennartsfors R�nke�l;Falkenberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Sverige;Bottled. Railings=R�cke, Bench=B�nk. Combine the two and you have a R�nk. Now this is not a beer to lean on, although some farmers in Lennartsfors believe so. Pale golden it is of course, the aroma is from canned vegetables and vomit. Flavour is revolting and yeasty, as if it has not been fully fermented. Blah!
Max North Shore Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Max Lager's;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear brown with a thin light tan head.

Max North Shore Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Max Lager's;"On tap at Max Lagers, Atlanta. The bartender called this a black IPA and I reckon that fits as much as ""traditional ale"" (which tradition, I wonder?). Nice cola-dark pour with a hint of yeast, and a rocky tan head. Sticky retention too. Nose of dry roasts, mild citrus, and something fairly bready. Body is a bit underattenuated but the flavors were quite nice, blending together in a way that reminded me of Lonerider�s Grave Robber back home in NC."
Max North Shore Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Max Lager's;Dark pour, smallish head. Sweet malrty aroma. This was a good beer. Sweet, malty flavor, slight smokey flavor under some caramel and chocolate notes. Enough bitterness to balance (slight pine flavors) the sweetnessd, but not enough to take center stage. Smooth mouthfeel, almost perfectly crafted. Exactly as advertised...part brown ale, part porter.

Max North Shore Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Max Lager's;"On tap at the brewpub. This one has 8% abv according to the bartender. The official brewer�s description follows: ""Not quite a porter and more than a brown ale; a tribute to the brewer�s fond memories of Boston."" My description: delightful nutty toasty scent. not much head. dark brown with garnet highlights. toasted, woody flavor. a bit tart - bitter?, making the mouth feel too harsh. I have mixed feelings; perhaps it is overhopped for the style."
Max North Shore Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Max Lager's;Draft, deep ruby brown. Huge sweet caramel and molasses aroma, with a touch of roastiness. Larger roasty flavors, and lots of caramel with a moderate bitter finish and a touch of smoke. Body with medium to thick, with initial sweetness and finishing a little dry.
Max North Shore Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Max Lager's;"Deep, rich amber color with no real predominant aroma. Taste is light and sweet and only mildly hopped. The best of the six beers I tried at this place. Commercial description is ""not quite a porter and more than a brown"". I find this ""tweener"" brew lacking anything of real substance."
Max North Shore Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Max Lager's;Pours a light brown with a short lived head. Flavor is sweet maltiness with a measure of hoppiness thrown in for balance. A great session ale.

Harrisons Apricot Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;This is something that might go better on a hot Summer day rather than on a Chicago November day. It�s basically an apricot flavoring of their fairly decent wheat. Not bad. A bit too fruity for me. Harrisons Brewing Company, Orland Park, IL
Sprecher Irish Lite Ale;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Sprecher Brewing Company;This was on tap at the Milwaukee Irish Fest 2004. Dark golden color with a large and foamy white head. There was a slight aroma of malt and some dust. The taste had some sweetness to the malt and a touch of hops. Nothing all that special, but it was better than I figured the �lite� title suggested.
Pepperwood Red Ale;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;On tap at the bistro. Very subtle aroma. Yeast is very tangy that I didn�t really enjoy. Not much to this beer at all. Probably my least favourite of all offerings.
Pepperwood Red Ale;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Tastes if the typical red ale taste. but alittle lighter. It had flavours of amber malts, slightly nutty and a bit of dryness to it. It was reasonably smooth. Overall it had a nice easy drinking taste to it.
Pepperwood Red Ale;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;a blend of the monkey brown and the cream ale, availble only at the brewpub. decent stuff, the roast comes through and you get a touch of hop action at the finish. the fruity elements of the cream ale come through in the flavour to add some complexity. worth the trouble of blending it.
Pepperwood Red Ale;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Dark reddish-brown colour with a thin head. Lightly roasty, earthy, largely caramelly nose. Soft, caramelly character is sweet but supple and perilously drinkable. Just a hint of earthy hop for balance. Pretty darn good red ale.
Pepperwood Red Ale;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Clear coppery-brown with lots of lacing. Sweet malt nose is vegetal. Nice roasted malt body is sweet, then has a roasty finish and is husky without tasting over-sparged. Sessionable.

Pepperwood Red Ale;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Mild, sweet, caramel malt aroma is pleasant if innocuous.

Caramel malts are dominant in the sweet, caramle and toffee flavour with very low offsetting bitterness. Medium body is somewhat sticky with moderate carbonation. Sampled on tap at the brewpub.

Aroma is sweet, but otherwise empty, and devoid of hops. Taste is the same, but crackery and dry to the finish... where they tacked the hops on. I was expecting better from my favorite style of beer, and this is certainly not a typical example. $4/12oz
Independence Imperial IPA;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Independence Brew Pub;Tap at brewery. Sweet pineapple/orange/pine hops aroma - subtle. Medium amber color with small head. Slightly sweet orange and pine hops blended nicely with moderate malt flavor. A nice beer but like some of their other beers, seems to be a step down stylewise.
Independence Imperial IPA;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Independence Brew Pub;Bite into a sweet clementine that�s been picked with overworked hands. The carbonation is so mild it�s indiscernable from the dry bitterness. Very citrusy aftertaste.

There was hardly any head at all to it. It was also a little fizzy. The aroma is mainly a lighter wheat. There was also a hint of citrus to it. The body was somewhat light. The flavor was also a little light, but mailny of wheat and a hint of citrus. Heffe light? Refreshing, but a bit thin.

South Street Pilsener;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;South Street Brewery;Reviewed from notes. Pours a golden straw color with a nice white head and a good deal of lacing. The nose brings some nice floral and herbal Noble hops and a bit of grain. The taste is a bit lighter overall but still brings some really nice hop flavors with a bit of light grain. Nice, crisp body with great carbonation. This is a really nice brew and probably the best I had here. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 10-26-2010
South Street Pilsener;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;South Street Brewery;Golden straw pour, not really any head at all. Almost yellow. Clean, modest hops, grassy and earthy. Kinda fruity? Apricot? Grassy, noble hops? Quite full flavoured for the style. Very nice. Crisp, clean. A zip of carbonation, and an easy drinker - as they often are. Decent session beer.
South Street Pilsener;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;South Street Brewery;On tap at brewpub. Pale straw color. Nice bitter pils aroma with grainy notes. Beautiful balance between bitterness and maltiness in the taste. Best beer at South Street that night.
South Street Pilsener;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;South Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. I thought this was a very decent brewpub pilsner. Slightly hazy straw colour. Quite muted aroma but springs to life on the palate. Dry and nicely balanced with a mixture of biscuity malt and sharp hops. Clean and refreshing.

South Street Pilsener;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;South Street Brewery;From a growler- light and clear- nice head on tap, rather flat from the growler. Nice hoppy aroma, (appropriate for the style, this isn�t and IPA). The flavor is smooth and malty, I would prefer a little more bitterness, but not flawed. There is that South Street house flavor again- not unpleasant, but curious. Not yeast, since i�ve noticed it in ales and lagers- maybe a bittering of flavoring hop?
South Street Pilsener;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;South Street Brewery;Golden yellow with a nice head. Smells slightly sweet. Taste is what threw me- this is a fantastic pils! Without a doubt, one of the best I have had (I�m not a huge fan of the style). Highly recommended for macro drinkers, because this is close enough, yet SO much better.
Osterbrau Pilsner Classic;Qibray tumani, Toshkent viloyati, Uzbekistan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Osterbrau;Unlike the Pilsner Special, this actually bears resemblance to the pilsner style. Clear golden colour. Slightly crisp with very light, clean malts, field-like noble hops and more bitterness than just about any CIS brew I�ve had yet. A little understated still, with melon esters.
Qibray 12;Salar, Qibray, Uzbekistan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;QK Inter-Rohat;Very sweet amber lager with ample caramel notes. Aroma shows a touch of gasoline. Body is light and the palate is very simple. Sweet finish.
Patriot 4;Qizg�aldok, Zangiota d., Tashkent r., Uzbekistan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mehnat;Dull light gold colour. Minerally, acidic, limey aroma. Very flat. I mean flatter than tap water flat. Ultra-nasty flavour of minerals, diacetyl and rotting garbage. Beyond drainpour. I think this is Uzbekistan�s version of the Studencheskoye recipe.
Republic of Boulder IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Republic of Boulder;"Clear and golden; thin head. Light body; somewhat watery and thin at times; active carbonation. Light malts with mild flavors of cereal, bread and grains. Very mild sweetness. Hops were herbal, flowery and grassy. Bitterness level was too high, especially with the weak malt backbone ... a little unbalanced in that respect. Otherwise, it�s not too bad. Has a lot of potential."
Republic of Boulder IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Republic of Boulder;Draught. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain, cereal), lightly hoppy (lemon), with a light note of bubble gum. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, heavily bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. From aroma alone, I wouldn�t have guessed this to be an IPA. In the mouth, it�s way out of balance (very bitter and sour, squashing the malt utterly). This recipe clearly needs some more work.
Republic of Boulder White Out;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Republic of Boulder;tap at brewpub-alongside Ernest and Aubery-pours a hazy orange hue with a small white head. medicnal yeast qualities and no corriander to speak of. really off-flavors-soapy notes mostly. this is really off and wierd!
Republic of Boulder White Out;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Republic of Boulder;Called White Out at the brewery, December 2004. Clear amber color, darker than most witbiers with a big fruity bubble-gum nose with considerable hops... coriander, butterscotch and oranges. Semi-thick texture, a little alcohol noticed, more like a trippel than a wit at times. Nice even bitter balanced with a sweet vanilla and orange flavor. Peaches and some soapy flavors show up as well. Very well made.
Republic of Boulder White Out;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Republic of Boulder;Clear and medium amber. Thickish body. Sweet, honey-like malts. Spicy, flowery hops with a pretty big bitterness level. Notes of clove, orange and lemongrass. More along the lines of a Belgian golden or even a light saison. Style classification aside, it�s a pretty good beer on its own.
Republic of Boulder White Out;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Republic of Boulder;Draught. Body is medium amber (!). Aroma is lightly malty (cookie), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of bubble gum, clove, and orange. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. The name is a misnomer, as it�s quite deeply amber-colored...but even besides that, it seems more like a generic fruity Belgian ale than a true witbier (I�m not saying there�s no coriander or orange peel in this, but they're faint at best, and the overall impression of this beer isn�t witbier IMHO). So for now, I will leave this in the more general style category of Belgian Ale. If I were forced to rate this against witbiers, the score would drop to a 2.2 or so.
III Dachshunds Smooth Red Lager;Cudahy, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;3 Dachshunds Beer Company;I don�t usually like toffee/butterscotch flavors in large quantities, so when I read about this beer on another site I was less than interested. Decided to try it at the Landmark 1850 in Milwaukee, and while there is quite a bit of butterscotch flavor there it�s nice and balanced. Pours red, with a lasting head. Nice.
III Dachshunds Smooth Red Lager;Cudahy, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;3 Dachshunds Beer Company;Lightly hazed orange/brown color with a heavy one finger head of tight dark cream bubbles. Sweet butterscotch and toasted malt aroma. Diacetyl City, but it work in a yorkshire stone kind of way. This one has as much butterscotch as any beer that I think I have ever had, But i do like it.
III Dachshunds Pierblad Pale Ale;Cudahy, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;3 Dachshunds Beer Company;Rated basically from memory of a pour at Landmark 1850. JPDIPSO is right -- from the description one would think one was going to drink a Pale Ale, with its attendant floral aroma and bitter flavor from the hops. Instead, you get a nicely balanced malty PA, which is truly more of a bitter than a PA. Decent beer, maybe it just needs a new name!
III Dachshunds Pierblad Pale Ale;Cudahy, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;3 Dachshunds Beer Company;Light golden color with a small dense off white head. Faint pale malt and citric aroma. Earthy malt and hopsack flavors. More like a bitter. Sound good but the description does not translate to the pour.
III Dachshunds Weiner Dog Wit;Cudahy, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;3 Dachshunds Beer Company;Also seems to go by the name Double Dapple Ale. Straw color with a small white head. Very light wheat aroma. Light spice flavors with coriander, mild white pepper, and hint of vanilla. A touch light in malt, but very quenching.
Hermann Joes Porter;Hermann, Missouri, United States;Porter;Hermann Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. The server called this Joe�s Stout and the commercial description even clouds the issue. Either way, the beer sucks big time. Black in color with an off-white decent head. Something is very wrong with this beer. Extreme sourness prevails. Highly acidic and overwhelming tartness dominates the taste. Possibly even vinegar-like. No aroma other than the aforementioned mistakes. No roasted or chocolate flavors. Taste is closer to a Fresca or a Wink. YUCK!
Hermann Joes Porter;Hermann, Missouri, United States;Porter;Hermann Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. This beer poured very dark with a very thin head. It has a a slightly sour aroma. When I tasted the beer it was totally dominated by a horrible sour taste. I think the beer was bad or the lines were dirty. It was the worst porter I�ve ever had. It was one of the worst beers I�ve ever had. I hope it was because I got the last bit of the last batch at the end of the season and not because the beer was supposed to taste like this.
Hermann Joes Porter;Hermann, Missouri, United States;Porter;Hermann Brewing Company;This is a decent beer ... light body and character, but a decent coffee/smokiness, yet somehow sweet. Porter for the masses, I�d call this.
Hermann Kolsch;Hermann, Missouri, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Hermann Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Cloudy dirty dark gold with a white head. Aroma had a slight apricot smell. Hoppy flavor with an odd fruitiness for a kolsch. Served at a warmer temperature than expected. Mildly bitter finish.
Hermann Kolsch;Hermann, Missouri, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Hermann Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery. Much like the porter, this beer was dominated by a sour taste that I suspect came from dirty lines or old beer. This beer had a bit of potential but the sour infusion ruined it. I couldn�t even finish a 10oz sample. Yuck!! I hope this beer was bad and that it wasn�t supposed to taste the way it did.
Hermann Kolsch;Hermann, Missouri, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Hermann Brewing Company;At the brewpub. Cloudy, with a sweet aroma. Not bad, although wasn�t very flavorful. Drinkable, yet nothing spectacular.

Pretty dark golden colour with white head. A little much carbonation at first. Aromas of wheat with soft notes of lemon and banana. Medium body.
Hansens Weizen;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hansens Brauerei;Lovely unfiltered hefeweizen with good aroma of yeast. The taste is not like the typical Bavarian hefeweizen where the taste of the mature banana is more prominent. On the other hand, this hefeweizen has more acidic taste of wheat, light citrus and partly full-bodied bitter bitterness. The carbonation is medium and it is a lovely thirst-quenching wheat beer.
Hansens Weizen;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hansens Brauerei;Out of three different beers from Hansens Brauerei I found the Weizen as the best choice. Some bread and spicy tones.

Fand den Geschmack erst total seltsam, inzwischen steh ich voll drauf.

F�r mich das beste Weizenbier von allen!!! Ich bin immer wieder hin und weg, wenn ich mir nach l�ngerer Zeit mal wieder eine Halbe davon aufmache. Man schmeckt sofort, dass dies aus einer ganz kleinen Klitsche (""Microbrewery"" wie man bei uns in Bayern so sch�n sagt) kommen muss. Hier hat man kein designtes Industrieprodukt im Glas.

Teme Valley Buchanalia;Knightwick, Worcestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Teme Valley Brewery;Cask @ Worcester BF, UK Backlog 13 Aug 2004 Brewed in memory of Andy Buchan, a local, well known ticker/scooper. Hopefully this is not a one off brew. Of the ones I manage to sample this day, this was definitely the best. Dark golden and a citrus aroma. Sweet, malty taste initially, that seamlessly develops into a flowery hoppiness. If this was served as a session beer at my local there would be many and long sessions...
Weatheroak Olympic Gold;Studley, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Weatheroak Brewery;Clear golden liquid, average head. Weak, sweet aroma of hops. Light body, tiny little bit carbonation. Taste is sweet and bitter.
Weatheroak Olympic Gold;Studley, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Weatheroak Brewery;Cask @ Worcester BF, UK Backlog 13 Aug 2004 Another hoppy, golden summer ale. This one must be the hoppiest of the lot, though. Program clames it is brewed with a new type of hops. My guess it is a cross of Fuggles (spicy) and Bramling Cross (black currant). Interesting but a bit OTT.
Empyrean American Wheat;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Empyrean Brewing Company;Tap. This beer was part of the Beerquest series. Local homebrewers compete to see who will get their recipe brewed by the brewery. This time it was Omaha homebrewer Dave McGrath. Hazey golden honey autumnal leaves color...little/no lace...great color, just no head! Peachy, fruity hops/yeast aroma mingles w/ malt. Crisp, citrusy beer w/ good hop profile...lemon rind...citric tartness & bitterness finish the beer. Suprisingly enjoyable and likely the best beer I�ve had from Empyrean. I was expecting a Boulevard Wheat clone, and got something with a lot more complexity and some very nice hop highlights to it. Still very light in body(as their beers almost always are) but it didn�t hurt this nice quaffer. I wish it was a full time brew.

Pours black, with a 1-finger pale tan/cream coloured head. Great lacing. Nose is gentle smoke, some roast. Flavours of smoke, moderate creamy roast, some typical mocha notes. Pretty much a dead-on-style Smoked Porter, but nothing to set it apart from the crowd.
Town Hall Sparnfarkel Smoked Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Smoked;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Poured from tap into pint glass. Very dark red that appears black with thin head and no lacing. Smoky aroma (obviously) - peat, vanilla and something I can�t quite identify. There is something off-putting but I am still intrigued so that counts for something. Smoke dominates to the point that I can�t really identify true malt or hop characteristics. Now, this is not necessarily bad, but there is a problem. Is it the peat? No, that is quite nice. Is it the wood and vanilla? No, that is quite nice as well. Is that band aids I taste? I believe so, and that is the problem, and is also what was off with the smell. Still tastes fairly good, but now I can�t get past band aids. Moderate carbonation, somewhat smooth but a little thin. Well, it is interesting, but I have had much better Smoked Porters. Glad I tried and I kind of enjoyed it, but I don�t want to have it again. However, I am wondering if the band aid taste is usually there, as others seems to love this beer.
Town Hall Sparnfarkel Smoked Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter - Smoked;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Sampled at GABF 2009. Black pour. Aroma of smoked sausage.

Typical vegetal aroma, but no alcohol smell. Gold with a fluffy head, no lacing. Palate is very smooth, medium bodied and watery at the finish. Taste is sweet maibock like malts - creamy sugar, hints of bread, light cinnamon candy pepper on the tip of my tongue. Not really any hops in the finish - you weren�t expecting any, were you?

Black Rock Venin de Vipere;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Black Rock Brewing Company;Out of the 3 beers I had at Black Rock, this was my favorite. A nice Belgian, I think it had around 12% abv. Good flavor and body, easy to drink. I guess moral support is really the only reason to be rating this, so good job guys! If they ever reopen, this one is worth a try.

Rocky Run Big Gut Pale Ale;Glen Burnie, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rocky Run Tap & Grill;glen burnie - didnt think this was what it should have been called, the nose was weak and piney, but the flavor and the aftertaste didnt have nearly the hops that i thought this should have delivered...it was much maltier than i expected, which isnt a bad thing, but it wasnt what i thought this beer should be.

Rocky Run Big Gut Pale Ale;Glen Burnie, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rocky Run Tap & Grill;"Terrible as a pale ale--a bit hoppy but mostly like a typical American lager dressed up as a microbrew. But not necessarily bad as ""beer"". A little fruitiness, which wasn�t unpleasant. Yellow color. (on tap at St. Paul Street location.

So part poured with massive head. Really murky brown. Nose - hazelnuts and suspicion of wild yeast. Taste - nuts, malt, dry and uninviting. Palate - close to medium bodied with a dry crunchy texture and a long dry astringent finish. The wild yeast thing is definitely there. Overall - there is a problemehere. This is going down the sink.
Corvedale Dark And Delicious;Corfton, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Corvedale Brewery;Lives up to the name, dark and delicious. Nice drop, chocolatey malts on the nose and taste.
Corvedale Dark And Delicious;Corfton, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Corvedale Brewery;Bottle @ Croydonia Tasting. Cheers to BLADDOCK for supplying this. The pour�s murky brown with no head whatsoever. Pretty ugly. The nose is not particularly pleasant. Fart. Some tangy chocolate-covered strawberry. THe taste is lightly tart. Sort of papery and faded. Little else, lacks character. Light body, fine carbonation. Overall, not a winner.
Corvedale Dark And Delicious;Corfton, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Corvedale Brewery;Bottle split at the Croydonia Tasting, 13/07/13, thanks to Jeremiah Bladdock for the trade! Murky 3 day old festival toliet water, orange/amber turd juice with a light beige head. Nose is unintentionally soured, tarte fruits, light smoke, touch of the balsams - infected! Taste comprises dark fruit, soured pitted fruit, toffee, sour dough brown bread. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, tarte fruity finish. Just about palatable (a moderate pour that its!) but not as it should be!

John Harvard's Cambridge Crooked Caber;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;On tap at John Harvards, Cambridge MA, 28 September 2009. Murky mahogany appearance. I suspect the recipe has changed after what seems like a lengthy absence as I noted a distinctly smoky character throughout. Sweet and creamy on the palate. Lots of soft caramel/toffee. Fine if you like that sort of thing but not really my bag.
John Harvard's Cambridge Crooked Caber;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;"Pint at the JH at Harvard Square, Cambridge. Clear medium maple color, small lasting creamy head...light woody, sugary nose offers little malt presence and no smoky peat or anything else really ""scotch ale""-like...sugary sweet body, slight malt presence, bit of maple and oak at the end and a surprising amount of ethanol for its ABV...syrupy at first, thin at the finish...really mediocre."
John Harvard's Cambridge Crooked Caber;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;2004 draught at John Harvard�s in Cambridge. Pours a medium maple wood-like brown. Small but firm off-white head. Aroma is faint, but has a light nutty smell, along with a touch of roast, chocolate and hops. The hops seem a bit high-alpha like, but there isnt much of it there, so I can forgive. The flavor is a bit thin, not terribly so, but has a dry roasty touch finished with a light nutty/chocolatey note mixed with some hops. Little to no alcohol apparent and overall, a mostly smooth, medium to medium-light body. The roast was good, maybe a hint of light hickory smoke, but nothing that�s going to really challenge the palate.

Great Deep Oatmeal Stout;Hagatna, Guam;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Great Deep Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Deep brown with a off white to tan head. Malt and oat to the nose. Flavors similar, also a bit of a sour component to the brew. Pretty good for the island. Re sampled on 4/10/09. 20 oz pour from the tap. Poured a lot darker. Nose was deep roasted malt. The beer entered strong with brewed coffee. Flavors built with more of a nicely roasted malt. Mouth was full with a little bitterness to it. This was much improved from the previous time. My rating if for the latest tasting.
Great Deep Oatmeal Stout;Hagatna, Guam;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Great Deep Brewing Company;From tap. Rerate. Black with a bubbly tan head that dissapates to a film.

Selins Grove Milk Stout;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Beautiful thick milkshake-like mouthfeel. Supersweet like a strong cappuchino. Finally, a stout of theirs that stands out a bit. This would be too sweet to for some, with hints of raisins, syrup, and cream, but it�d make a great dessert beer.

21st Amendment Watermelon Wit;San Leandro, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;21st Amendment Brewery;Draft yesterday at the Dutch with lunch. It was pretty hot and the shade of the bar was quite refreshing...then again when isn�t the bar refreshing? That�s part of the reason I go there. Well the tap handle struck me as unique and I asked for a sample. A 12oz sample was placed before me. Not looking a gift horse and all I consumed it with gusto. I thought the watermelon would be more fleeting. I�ve had watermelons be less watermelony. Now don�t go off and start rambling that I�ve lost it or that my tounge must be on vacation....both of those things happened long ago. All I am stating that this watery brew is quite fruity, but really doesn�t hit me as a solid wheat beer. sure there�s wheat in it but just because I can recognize a New York Yankees logo still don�t make me a fan. (Go Phillies!)
21st Amendment Watermelon Wit;San Leandro, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;21st Amendment Brewery;Can�t say much for this beer except admire the effort. barely hint of watermelon, but astringent aftertatste may be the result, very light cream and slightly cloudy, no head and not much flavor
21st Amendment Watermelon Wit;San Leandro, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;21st Amendment Brewery;Tap. Slightly hazy, minimal head. I honestly don�t get any sort of watermelon in the taste or flavor, but this can stand on its own as a regular old wit. Dry and yeasty.
21st Amendment Watermelon Wit;San Leandro, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;21st Amendment Brewery;This is a different take on the 21st Ammendments Watermelon Wheat beer. About the same ABV, this WIT is a bit spicier then the Wheat version of this beer. More complex with hints of Corriander and banannas will make this yet another summer time hit for the Shawn O�Sullivan and the 21-A!

Clear dark mahogany brown in colour with a thin white head. Slight note of roast malt in the short nose. Creamy mouthfeel and good lacing.

Dilemma van Arcen GvdB/012;Arcen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Converting ticks to ratings: Had this back when it was released.

North End Dawks Classic Porter;Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States;Porter;North End Tavern & Brewery;Opaque and richly black with a medium tannish head. A strong roasted quality to this, to the point where it takes on many coffee qualities in both aroma and taste.

Maybe also some honey like maltiness, but it�s so thin that�s a nonsense to write about flavors here. Almost no finish. Well, nothing unpleasant here, at contrary, just it lacks ton of a body.

Barley Johns Sunny Summer Ale;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Barley Johns Brew Pub;"This is not the other ""Summer Ale"" listed here, for this had no witbier characteristics, and, in fact, it wasn�t even intended to be an ale, but then, ooops!

Cloudy, deep amber hue, nearly yellow at glass�s bottom, wigh a creamy, meringue-like, snow-white dollop of froth atop. Aroma: possesses fruity esters, but doesn�t project to far, soft & light, mild, but appreciable. Taste is again mild, just a touch of hops, big malty taste. Solid body, though light, medium finish, leaves palate on friendly terms and begs for another taste. Very refreshing ale, easy to toss back without a trouble, but none too memorable.

Vierling Presque Isle Pilsner;Marquette, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Vierling Restaurant & Marquette Harbor Brewery;On-tap at the brewpub and listed as Presque Isle Pilsner: Simple yet inviting straw gold yellow with a active center and a bright white top of starchy foam. Fades to a thin ring and some small patchy dotted lacing sticks. Aroma is of the Saaz hops, as it should be, grassy and herbal, moderately vibrant and snappy with a crisp intent. Wheat grain and sharp toasty breads back it up. Taste is the same with a nice crisp edgyness and sharp toned Saaz hop spice. Higher ended grass tones tend to stick as fresh and fairly zippy, lip-smacking wheatish bread keep the drink alive from start to finish. Ends with a quick sweep of herbal dryness backed by a low surge of sweetness. Feel is crisp and toned with that certain Pils zip, tang, pep, and spice, which is done quite nicely here. Carbonation seemed a bit top heavy at first but leveled off as it warmed and where it became much better in the smoother areas and not so carbonated. Medium/light body and kept its Saaz character. This was gone is no time. Very drinkable and just as enjoyable.

Nose has biscuit and camomile. Light body, slight sweetness. Herbal notes, tons of chamomile, smooth, clean finish with vanilla. Wow this is incredibly refreshing, I�m a huge tea fan and this hits the spot for me, very good.
Founders Chamomile Kolsch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);first impression was good: a nice and strong chamomile smell as well as a very tasty chamomile flavoring....although very weak in nature, i enjoyed this beer...the best way i can described it as is REFRESHING (especially if you have been drowning yourself in strong stouts all evening!!!) :-)
Founders Chamomile Kolsch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Hazy yellow with a strange chamomile odor, perfumy and very strong. It�s a light Kolsch-style beer dominated by the perfuminess of the added ingredient. taste is light and really reminded me of the Heather Ale from Scotland. Refreshingly strange.
Founders Chamomile Kolsch;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"On tap at Founders. Hazy yellow/straw body, thin off-white head. The beer is called ""Chamomile"" and the namesake dominates both the flavor and aroma. I imagined sitting next to a box of Kleenex on a snowy winter day, sipping on this beer from a tea cup between sniffles. Behind the strong chamomile flavor was a light, somewhat tangy malt body. An interesting concept but uninspired attempt."

Shipwrecked Captains Copper Ale;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Visited their brewpub, but this one I bought in a six-pack. I got biscuit/cracker, a bit of dark toffee/burnt caramel in the aroma and taste. Medium bitterness, medium-light body. Nothing that special. So far, two of four of the six pack were sour. Not at all cool by any means. If I wanted sour beer (which I love), I would have sought it out.
Shipwrecked Captains Copper Ale;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Bottle. It poured a clear orange color with a small white head. The aroma was of malts and bread. The taste was similar to the aroma with some flowery hops and a touch of lemon. Not bad.

Aroma of nothing. Taste of malt and hops with a dry finish. This medium to full bodied brew is not bad and pretty tasty.
Shipwrecked Captains Copper Ale;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Aroma is a mix of very nutty malts and strong hints of toffee and coffee. The flavor is toffee, nutty malts and a mildly fruity/tart finish.
Shipwrecked Captains Copper Ale;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;"Sampled as part of a flight ""plank"" of the current drafts at the brewpub bar. Poured to plastic with an orange/amber color, a modest, off white head, and wavey lacing. The aroma was soft malt, a touch of caramel, light graininess, but that same acetic hint that I picked up in the Lighthouse Light was present, although slightly masked due to a little more complexity and ingredients in the style. The flavor was lightly dry and crisp, with medium hop bitterness in only a light to medium body. Altogether, just okay."
Brick House Nutty Paul Brown Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Nice toasted coffeeish mouthful with a little bit of toasted flavor. Has a hint of rich almost buttery nutty aftertaste. Qaulity brew.

Brick House Nutty Paul Brown Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;I was surprised by this one - a lot of brick house beers really don�t sit well with me, but this had a nice creamy body, and a very smooth flavor of roasted nuts and caramel - a tiny bite of hops in the finish - a little buttery, but not in a diacetyl-like way - the metallic character that plagues many of this brewer�s beers was not present at all.
Brick House Nutty Paul Brown Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;The man who this beer was named after, Paul Brown, was drinking at the Brick House when I had this one. It was pretty decent, it had a dark brown body, and wasn�t bad.

Brick House Nutty Paul Brown Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Dark brown with a thick creamy head that reveals the palate. I would be lying if I said that this beer had much in the way of a striking aroma, but this was not reflected in the taste what-so-ever. Highly roasted malty taste was dominant from start to finish but there was a hint of nuttiness also.
Brick House Nutty Paul Brown Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Tap at the brewpub. Dark brown beer, thick creamy off-white head. Pale malt, faint toast. Served too cold, but there is little in the way of complexity. Light maltiness, but fairly thin-bodied. Light toasted nuts in the finish, but very non-descript.
Brick House Nutty Paul Brown Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;this was surprisingly good - I�m not a fan of the brickhouse but this beer was dark rich roasted malt flavor and very complex palete - enjoyed it fully
Brick House Nitro Boom Stout;Patchogue, New York, United States;Stout;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Stopped at this nice little brewpub in long island. Unable to get good tasting notes because had to catch the ferry. Staff was very nice and the beers was enjoyable. Very nice food too.

Brick House Nitro Boom Stout;Patchogue, New York, United States;Stout;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;On tap 4 oz. sample at BrickHouse Brewery & Restaurant in Patchogue, NY. Opaque brown-black with full, creamy tan head and excellent lacing--about as good looking as a stout can get. Aroma of chocolate, dark malt, coffee and vanilla. Aroma is milder than I expected. Taste of cocoa, coffee, roasted malt and toast with just the right amount of bitterness in the finish. Quite nice. Light/medium body and no carbonation. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy, but is so thin that it detracts from the fine stout flavor or the beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Brick House Nitro Boom Stout;Patchogue, New York, United States;Stout;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Pours a dark brown with an odd iceberg patterned off white brownish lacing. Dominant notes of coffee, chocolate, cocoa and vanilla. Slight smokiness and a very funky off flavor.

Brick House Nitro Boom Stout;Patchogue, New York, United States;Stout;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;On nitro draught at the brewpub. Arrived at the table black with a dense, creamy, light cream colored head that lasted nearly to the end and left a coating of foam sliding down the side of the glass with each sip. Light aroma of roasted malt along with a few coffee notes. The flavor is roasted malt, light coffee, mild chocolate and some ash, with the ash more dominant towards the finish. Although smooth, this beer is a bit flat on the palate. Probably not something I would look to drink with regularity.
Brick House Nitro Boom Stout;Patchogue, New York, United States;Stout;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;I cant say that i really like or hate this beer everything is just a little too faint butt it gives a good buzz its middle of the road
Brick House Nitro Boom Stout;Patchogue, New York, United States;Stout;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Boom! They seem to have removed this word from the official name of this beer, but i think it makes it more fun and is probably the only real character this beer has. Boom! Anyway, it was on nitro, oddly enough, at the brewpub. Pretty weak all around. Mildly roasted, mildly sweet, sort of an off-putting bitterness in the flavor. Easy to drink if it wasn�t for the odd flavor. Won�t be going back to this one.
Brick House Nitro Boom Stout;Patchogue, New York, United States;Stout;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Nitro tap at the brewpub. Pours a dark brown with the nitro head. Aroma is roasty? Hard to smell of course. Flavor of roasted malt, bitter hops. Creamy palate of course. Decent stout. For this one, it probably helps that it�s on nitro.

Bischofshof Pils;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Bischofshof;From draft at Hotel Bischofshof in Regensburg. Clear gold, lightly sparkling, short white head. Extremely quiet aroma is cracker-y pale malt, starch, light apricot-lemon hop effect, cracked peppercorns, faint touches of metal / minerals and a subtle dried cheese / old hop quality. Clean and quenching and lightly sweet, juicy on the palate, lightly effervescent. Kind of muted and non-expressive, but clean and decently malty.
Bischofshof Pils;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Bischofshof;Absolut in Ordnung, wrnn auch recht unspektakul�r. Angenehm in Hopfen ubd Getreide, frisch im Abgang, moderate Bitterkeit. Alles ok.

Bischofshof Pils;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Bischofshof;My Bottom Line: This white apron Pilsener lays out bitter herbal hop lengths and polished cereals onto a fluffy and dry body. Further Personal Perceptions: -A creamy head of foam tops the clear gold. -The flavor profile is balanced. -The mouthfeel is very engaging. -This may not be the most memorable Pilsener, but everything it does it does very well. On tap at Bischofshof am Dom, Regensburg.
Brick House Hefeweizen;Patchogue, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Tap at the brewery with beasiefan2k. Cloudy yellow beer, no head. Dusty sort of non-descript aroma. Light apple flavour along with some wheat and earthy hops. Thin bodied. More american wheat than hefe and not a great example of either.
Brick House Hefeweizen;Patchogue, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Cloudy yellow, no head, no lace. Lemony/wheat with banana and some floral aromas.

Du Bocq Misty Blanche;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie Du Bocq;03/12 On tap @Cafekee, Madrid. It poured hazy yellow body with smaller head. Coriander and orange peel aroma, some chalk. Flavor was slightly sweet and a little bit sour, lactic and chalky, banana, sweet fruits, corinader and spicy somewhere between pepper and cinnamon.

Du Bocq Misty Blanche;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie Du Bocq;Really hard to find. I found it in La Plaza Mayor in Madrid. Fruity with little-nice champagne like bubbles. Refresehs and cleans all your mouth if eating fish or seafood. It�s citrus touch fits well with salads too.
Du Bocq Misty Blanche;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie Du Bocq;on draft madrid, spain: this was another of the �house beers� this cafe had. was grouped with the Te Deum beers which are also brewed by du bocq. this had your typical white beer look pale yellow with haze and white head. the nose was mostly of coriander and alot of it. the flavor was similiar.... a thin back bone of white beer wheatiness and citrus with an overpowering coridiander flavor. theres a whole lot of coriander here boys and girls. somewhat different and refreshing but i think the brewer needs to quit pushing the herb. not a class act among wit biers.

Magister Double Bock;Madrid, Spain;Bock - Doppelbock;Magister Fabrica de Cervezas;On tap at Magister. Poured a medium coppery amber with a short creamy white head. Aroma was quite nice with deep, lightly-smoked fruits (odd note of banana Pixy Stix comes to mind, and I don�t think that was even a flavor... but it was strangely arousing).. very sweet with zero alcohol apparent. The flavor was really, really sweet.. light and dark fruity sugars with some caramel.. lightly-toasted with a warm, sweet finish.. mild bitterness. The sweetness did manage to mask the booze well.. bit of a syrupy feel on the palate. I could drink it again, but probably wouldn�t.
Magister Double Bock;Madrid, Spain;Bock - Doppelbock;Magister Fabrica de Cervezas;On tap, sign on the wall says it�s the strongest beer brewed in Spain. Grapefruit aroma, burnt copper color with an off-white head. Roasted coffee and malty flavors. The aftertaste was definitely grapefruity. It was a good beer, but I wonder if it was aged enough.
Magister Double Bock;Madrid, Spain;Bock - Doppelbock;Magister Fabrica de Cervezas;Also called Autor, but I was told they did not have it, and got it almost when I was leaving. Interesting flavor, too alcoholic.
Magister Double Bock;Madrid, Spain;Bock - Doppelbock;Magister Fabrica de Cervezas;Draught at the brewpub, 9 %. Clear copper color, short head. Aroma of caramel malt, candy, sweetness.

Magister Double Bock;Madrid, Spain;Bock - Doppelbock;Magister Fabrica de Cervezas;on draft at magister madrid, spain: this one was the darkest of the lot with no carbonation and sick sweet meloncholy nose... unfermented malt molasses and alcohol. probably havent sold one of these (except to me) in the last week...steer clear. yo. the potato bravas are money though. skip the beer and eat just the potatoes though...way too many tapas places to waste the palate just here.
Full Sail Lawnbrau;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Full Sail Brewing Company;On tap at the Full Sail Brewery. Pours a light golden/yellow, very clear, with a nice white head. This brew had a grass/straw aroma with some floral hops. Taste was very clean and refreshing but not much to it other than light malts that gave it a straw taste and some light floral hopping toward the end. Decent simple brew.
Full Sail Cascade St. IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Had this beer on 8/23/1999. Color is a medium golden with good carbonation and head. There is a small amount of sediment floating in it. Aroma is a light thin malt scent. Taste is crisp and bitter. It starts with a light body that goes down with a crisp feel and lightly sweet malt flavor. Finish is is very bitter with sweet back tones of malt. It needs more hop flavor but is very drinkable.
Full Sail Cascade St. IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;On tap at the Full Sail Brewery. This brew was a bit too light on the malt to balance it well. A very clean IPA, very light weight to it, and lots of hoppy bitterness. Poured a nice amber color, very clear, with an ivory head and tons of citrus hops in the aroma. Good IPA, but it needed more malt for balance.
Danskeren Negra;Llavallol, Argentina;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Danskeren;Truly fantastic! THIS is the beer to get when you�re in Buenos Aires. Microbrewed in the BA suburb of Llavallol, it is only available at the Swedish Club and Olsen (a swank Scandinavian restaurant). Wow. It is very rich and malty with a touch of stout and comes in a bottle with a Danish flag on the label. Lots of yeast and very cloudy/murky. Truly terrific stuff.
Danskeren;Llavallol, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Danskeren;Terrific! Thick and rich with massive yeast flecks floating around. Not quite as delicious as the Danskeren Negra. Both are microbrewed in Llavallol, a suburb of B.A. since 2001 and seem to only be available in bottles at two places: the Swedish Club and a chic restaurant called Olsen (Scandinavian food). The brew is pretty malty and the alcohol shows a bit. Very good by Argentine standards - the best I had while there.
North Peak Cask Conditioned Mount Hood Pale Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Peak Brewing Company;Rated at North Peak Brewing Co. Very small white head and fine-small sized bubbles that were mostly lasting. Very fine suspended bubbles, transparent and a pale yellow hue. Malt and hoppy nose. All I could taste was hops.

Overall the flavor was just malt and hops.
North End Northern Light (NET Light);Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;North End Tavern & Brewery;Taster on tap at the brewpub. Served from a small plastic cup. Totally clear golden color. Head fades to nothing super quickly. Lots of large bubbles visible stuck inside the sides of the cup. Flavor is grain, cereal (cornflakes), and corn.

North End Northern Light (NET Light);Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;North End Tavern & Brewery;"Thin straw color; edge head, dots of lace. The taste is caramel malt and water. You can decide which one wins the argument. Nothing else happens through a disappearing act finish. So small that any food or outside flavors will cover it entirely. Not enough to even be bad."
North End Northern Light (NET Light);Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;North End Tavern & Brewery;Approximately 3 ounce sample pour (in a plastic oversized shot glass) at the brewpub in Parkersburg, West Virginia. The pour is clear golden yellow with basically no head. The aroma is dirty grain, with a bit of funk. The taste is toasted grain, that moves quick to diacetyl, and finishes very dirty. The palate is light bodied, lower carbonation and the aforementioned dirty finish. If they brew this beer for folks who are used to Bud Light, those folks are going to immediately have doubts about brewpub beer.
North End Northern Light (NET Light);Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;North End Tavern & Brewery;on tap-pours a white head and pale yellow color. Aroma is sweet grain. Taste is sweet grain, paper, some spice hops.

North End Northern Light (NET Light);Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;North End Tavern & Brewery;On tap at the North End Tavern, Parkersburg WV on 11 March 2010 (on the chalkboard as Northern Light at 6.0% - have they lowered the ABV or was the chalkboard wrong?). Only had a small taster of this as they weren�t offering a sampler and I wasn�t going to get through a pint of each of the beers. Seemed quite strong for the style, maybe with a little more to it all round. Clean enough. Unremarkable. Not a lot else to say.
North End Berry Wheat;Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North End Tavern & Brewery;Taster on tap at the brewpub, served in a plastic cup. Clear golden, slightly orange color. Thin white head. Definitely get the berry in the nose... Damn, this tastes straight up like a blue berry muffin. Moderate sweet, and a good light tart taste. Light carbonation, smooth, kind of soft texture, lightly dry finish. A very similar feel to standard WV wheat. An awesome, balanced, refreshing fruit beer.
North End Berry Wheat;Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North End Tavern & Brewery;Tap at the brewery.

North End Berry Wheat;Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North End Tavern & Brewery;Clear gold, no head, no lace, no carbonation. Taste begins with light malt which is challenged by raspberry flavoring that is quite tasty. A very light bittering shows up late. Not as strong as, but as well-imagined as any of the popular berry (framboise) drinks that are out there. Recommended.
North End Berry Wheat;Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North End Tavern & Brewery;Approximately 3 ounce sample pour (in a plastic oversized shot glass) at the brewpub in Parkersburg, West Virginia. The pour is a light haze golden yellow with not much white head. The aroma is big berry, sort of a generic black raspberry type nose. Pretty strong, hard to pick much up beyond that. The taste is artificial berry sweetness, perhaps a bit of the wheat grain peeks through, though this is all about the synthetic berry.. The palate light bodied, the berry flavor lingers.
North End Berry Wheat;Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North End Tavern & Brewery;on tap-pours a white head and yellow/gold color. Aroma is berry. Taste is berry, wheat, some spice hops.
North End Berry Wheat;Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North End Tavern & Brewery;Served on draft at the brewpub. Pours a hazy pink-tinged orange with a large creamy white head. Good head retention and lacing. Aroma of artifically flavored berry syrup with some wheat notes. The taste is wheat and berries. Dry. Thin bodied. Like so many berry wheat beers this comes across as soda-like.
Great Dane Barleyport;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;I�m not sure that �pours� is the right word, as I�m not convinced that a spatula wasn�t involved, but anyways� Pours an incredible purple-brown color, looking like a port wine with some brown thrown in just for spite. Aroma of port wine, with plums, raisins, and cherry. Oh, and alcohol. Lots of alcohol. No head. No foam would dare stand up to this stuff. �Legs� like a port wine. Incredibly sweet beer, full fruity port-like taste, then some intense honey malt and caramel. Thick with honey and molasses flavor. All this sweetness going on, and just when you think if might be cloying, it finishes with this tart, thick, alcoholic, pomegranate flavor - and lots of it. Silky smooth full body, no carbonation, powerfully tasty.
Great Dane Barleyport;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap. Pours a cloudy ruby-auburn with a ring of bubbles around the rim that leaves no lacing. Gorgeous rich vinous sweet malty aroma with loads of fruity esters. Flavor lacks the intensity the aroma suggests, but it�s still a lovely fruity, sweet, malty barleywine with strong notes of raisin, dried cherries & cranberries, and a steady buildup of hop bitterness that provides nice balance without ever becoming acrid, all backed up by warm, soothing alcohol. Huge thick full mouthfeel and a thick, slightly sticky palate. Intensify the flavor by one notch and this is a grand slam.
Great Dane Barleyport;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"Rated 9/24/2004 (never entered). Dark amber color, thin off-white ring of head around the glass. Licoricey caramel hops. Sweet with dark fruit; a bit overwhelming, but very delicious. Would have liked to have more."
Great Dane Barleyport;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft in Madison: still dark brown maple syrup appearance with straggly bubbles around the edges. Coast the glass with a thick copper film�thick maple, soy aroma with plenty of alcohol present to go along with dried fruits, sweet resin, black cherry skins and dark honey. Sweet alcohol laced vanilla beans and strikingly bitter oranges. Palate is sticky, thin & flat, but works all right here. Lingering sticky candy flavour & texture�would work very well as an aperitif�
Great Dane Barleyport;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Dark chestnut color with a tinge of rudy on the edges. Only a few bubbles on floating on the top. Rich, lightly oily feel. Aromas lean to malt, but a fulsome of fruit also abound. Caramel and rasians, nuts and figs seem to waft about. Flavors come out a little thinner than the nose, but are still present and fulfilling. Mild warmth fills the stomach. Mild wood flavors come out late in the linger. A more traditional barley wine that was a good finish for the day.
Great Dane Barleyport;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Cask Conditioned, Madison: Deep rustic brown hue with an oily body which coated the glassware nicely. The aroma is very malty (caramel, toast,smoke), fruity (plum, raisin, apple, blackberry), with additional nose of vanilla, slight oak, bourbon hints and cardamom like spiciness. Nice! Twangy taste upfront with molasses and a fruity attack on the palate. It is heavy and displays good depth with additional undertones of vanilla, mocha, light bitters, and an oaky character. The feel is a bit burning after a while, oily and lush. This is a top notch strong brew and is something to savor. A bourbon barrel done right!
Philadelphias Strawberry Blonde;Portland, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Philadelphias Steaks and Hoagies Brewpub;Light yellow color. Light strawberry note is there, a bit grainy, however. Very light... with most of the flavor being just All-Purpose-Berry-Flavor. Grainy apple finish. Subpar.

Pours a clear golden pale amber brew with lots of carbonation with a creamy off-white head that leaves behind a nice sticky lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, flowery hops and some light citrus peel. Taste has a very dry multi-grain malt texture, medium bodied with extra carbonation. Finish is slightly gritty with a dry bitter aftertaste that lingers around after the finish. Not a West Coast stye IPA (citrus/grapefruity) but the lingering bitter aftertaste is there.
Legends Claude Alloueze Indian Pale Ale;Howard, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Legends Brewhouse & Eatery;Festival Tap: Bright golden beer with a nice citrus aroma. Solid all-around IPA, nicely balanced. Sweet malts with a hint of caramel and strong rindy hops at the finish.

Gradl Leupser Dunkel;Pegnitz-Leups, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Brauerei Gradl;Taster from bottle, courtesy of Werckmeister, many thanks! Pours a clear dark amber with an off white head. The aroma is lightly malty with rye bread, toasted bread, earthy, some cardboard, hints of butter, toffee and light herbal/metallic notes. Light to medium body with a clean light to medium bitterness. The flavor is light to medium hoppy with a generic earthy and herbal hoppy bitterness and some malt in the back - dried fruits, toffee, cardboard, some green apples, some toastesd malt. Finishes with a lasting medium hoppy bitterness and some toasted notes. Rather unbalanced for me - in my opinion the bitterness clashes with the below average body.

Ringneck Freeedom Pale Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The Brew Kettle;"22 oz bottle purchased @ the BK on 5/17/06: Medium coppery amber w/ a lasting, creamy off white head. Initial aroma is lightly grapefruity hop and toasty malt. Moderate caramel, and a bit of nutty aroma. Also, oddly enough lightly fruity floral. Taste though is balanced definitively toward bitter from start to finish. Grapefruity hops shine through the malt flavor which is light caramel and toasty. Definitely hop dominant. Finish is on the dry side w/ a lingering hop flavor and bitter aftertaste. It�s not a harsh bitterness, but it does last. The fruitiness is lighter in flavor than aroma. Medium carbonation, lighter medium body, and a bit of dry, but not astringent m/f. Not ""my cup of tea"" as far as bitterness goes, but it�s drinkable enough."

Aroma light raspberry, red apple, airy. Body is fairly light, smooth, low carbonation. Taste is sweet, thin apple juice, red apple, cheap tinned fruit salad in thin syrup, dries out a little in the finish. Perfectly fine serviceable stuff, but a bit thin for my taste.

Thatchers Gold;Winscombe, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Thatchers Cider;As Thatcher's Original Cider, same ABV. Gold, no head to speak of. Nice low carbonation really suits it. Aroma of sweetish apples but it's not all that sweet and has a mildly drying apple peel finish. Made a mustard and cider chicken dish with this and drank the rest with it. It's unspectacular but pleasant with nice balance.

Thatchers Gold;Winscombe, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Thatchers Cider;Keg from beer tent at New Haw Summer Fair. Thought I'd had this already so pleased to see that I didn't waste me time on non-ticks. Cage puppy apple aroma with some syrupy sweetness. Gold. Thin frothy white head. Light sweet with a sour edge.

New Forest Snake-Catcher Scrumpy - Sweet (Draught);Ringwood, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;New Forest Cider;Cask from the wooden barrel at the stall in borough market. Alround rating: Los of funky apple and notes of apple sauce which you dont get from the other medium and dry, tannic hazelnut woodyness, its still fairly dry in a westons termanoligy, but it varys from day to day whenever i buy it and i love the stuff because of that.
New Forest Snake-Catcher Scrumpy - Sweet (Draught);Ringwood, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;New Forest Cider;A Mes rate: barrel @ GBBF. Fairly pale hazy gold colour. Sweet as hell but at the same time freakishly dry. Takes your breath away with wooden tannin laden dryness when you smell but is full of vanillary sweetness in the mouth. Unusual, interesting and enjoyable.

New Forest Snake-Catcher Scrumpy - Sweet (Draught);Ringwood, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;New Forest Cider;From the wooden barrel at the Borough Market stall. This �sweet� cider is less sweet than many dry ciders. Softly flavoured apple skin character, reserved sweetness, very juicy and full of flavour. Hardly sweet.
New Forest Snake-Catcher Scrumpy - Sweet (Draught);Ringwood, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;New Forest Cider;Barrel. I prefer dry ciders, but for a sweet this really did the trick. managed to be sweet, yet juicy and refresing and even a little dry on the finish. Really well balanced.

New Forest Snake-Catcher Scrumpy - Medium (Draught);Ringwood, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;New Forest Cider;From the barrel at Chelmsford Beer Festival on 15 July 2011. Noted at 7.0%. Considering this is made in Hampshire and presumably does not make heavy use of traditional cider apple varieties, this had a surprisingly farmyardy aroma. Firm and fruity on the palate with moderate tannin. A very decent drop.

New Forest Snake-Catcher Scrumpy - Dry (Draught);Ringwood, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;New Forest Cider;From oak barrel at Borough Market as New Forest Draught Cider Dry 7%. Hazy orange, still with no head. Aroma is airy, some armpit, cardboard. Body is oily with very light carbonation. Taste is very dry, woody, some vinegar, touches of blue cheese, not even a hint of sweetness, some varnish. Absolutely bone dry with a prominent acidity. A very interesting drink, but hard to drink in large quantities. They sell pints of this, but doubt they get many takers. I found it quite hard going.
New Forest Snake-Catcher Scrumpy - Dry (Draught);Ringwood, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;New Forest Cider;A Sim rate (bag in a box at the Bree Louise): Smells sweet and sour all at once. Sour red apple with a sugary tinge. Flavour is sour in a nice citric fashion but screaming of green apple and apple peel. Sharp and spicy. Quite dry but not dry enough.

New Forest Snake-Catcher Scrumpy - Dry (Draught);Ringwood, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;New Forest Cider;From the barrel at Borough Market, London. I stumbled across a harvest festival called October Plenty while in London for the day recently. Ciders from New Forest were available labeled dry, medium, and sweet. I had the Dry, so I assume it was this entry. It smelled of green apples and had a very enjoyable apple flavor with ample earthy tones. It was a delicious quaff while I watched a man dressed as some indeterminate type of animal play the violin and other costumed musicians join in.
New Forest Snake-Catcher Scrumpy - Dry (Draught);Ringwood, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;New Forest Cider;From the barrel at the farm (10/07/05). I�m suprised that I havent tried this cider in the 3 years I�ve been living in the Southampton area right next to the new forest - the last time I had it was probably in Leamington! Woody tannins and country aroma with a very appley fruity finish. Pleasingly (but not austerely) dry with a good balance of acidity.
New Forest Snake-Catcher Scrumpy - Dry (Draught);Ringwood, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;New Forest Cider;Barrel. Yeah, nice stuff. Farmyard funk aroma. Nice juicy and dry, with some woody characters, aswell as some fresh apple. Nice acidity in the finish.

Beaver Street Tripel;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Tripel;Beaver Street Brewery;Cloudy straw yellow pour with creamy white head and lace. A large corriander and clove aroma. Abv, bannanas, belgian yeast, and a very light bitter. Slick mouthfeel with good carbonation. A beer that was close to being a bit better than good.
Beaver Street Tripel;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Tripel;Beaver Street Brewery;on tap-pours a thin white ring for a head and cloudy straw yellow color. Aroma is pepper/clove, coriander, banana, lemon, sweet malt. Taste is coriander, banana, wheat/light malt, clove/pepper.
Beaver Street Tripel;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Tripel;Beaver Street Brewery;Pour was a big cloudy/hazy golden color, unfortunatley served with an orange. The aroma was orange sweet malts, some bitter bready yeasty elements. The flavor was thick and sticky sweet orange malts, only a slight wheaty bitterness, lacking a clean hoppy bite/finish, short of refreshing. A pretty disappointing taken on the style, but overall drinkable, as long as you only order one. Mouthfeel was not clean, sticky, bready, orangey sweet. They said this rang in at 11+%, but if so the alcohol was fairly tame, probably the only well done part of the beer (hidden by high residual sugars?).
Beaver Street Tripel;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Tripel;Beaver Street Brewery;Draught at Beaver Street Brewery, Flagstaff, Arizona. Beeing the right place at the right time, I was lucky that they just finished this 1000th anniversary batch and let me taste it as the first customer!! Hazy light yellow beer with no head. Fresh aroma of hops and hay with citrus tones. Mild and nice. Quite full in flavor, notes of hay, straw, citrus and malt with a fine hoppy bitterness. Dry and harsh in the finish. Pretty light considering the high ABV. A really nice tripel!
Bravo No.2;Navoiy, Navoiy region, Uzbekistan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Don-Invest MChJ;Dull light gold colour. Aroma is of creamed corn and biscuits. Slightly malty-accented pale lager flavour. Finish has hints of minerals and hops.
Bravo No.9;Navoiy, Navoiy region, Uzbekistan;Pilsener - Imperial;Don-Invest MChJ;Hazy light bronze. Aroma is soapy, peachy, lightly alcholic. Stiff body, but alcohol flavour is surprisingly muted beind bready malts and slight earthiness. Alcohol emerges late, but does not drastically interfere with the structure.
Sem Bochek 3;Semey, Kazakhstan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Semey Su;Slightly minty-tasting pale lager of golden hue. Fainty maltiness lies underneath this overall sweet beer. Mint and sage punctuate the quick finish.
Sail & Anchor Greece Lightning;Fremantle, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Sail & Anchor Brewery;This beer is hopefully just once off to go along with the Greek Olympics. To me it was a close copy of there Dockers Wheat beer, which probably got pulled about the time the footy team it was named after started there losing streak as they were heading towards the finals. It had a clear pale golden body with a medium size but short lasting head and a little lacing. Perfume hop aroma with a hit of banana. The flavour is a little sweet and lacking in body, a touch watery, oil, clove and lemon.
Kirin Hojun;Tokyo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);smells great, pours with an above average head, but the taste is that of an average, indistinguishable macro
Kirin Hojun;Tokyo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);"Ok, as of right now I take back any all-encompassing statements I may have made about Japanese Macro Brews. Nice bubbly, frothy head that never fully disappears. This one had a nice grassy, hoppy, malty, floral, and slightly sweet aroma. Flavors were very well-balanced and fairly complex, with malts and hops predominant. No trace of adjuncts. Also some grassy, fruity (pineapple?) notes. A really good pilsener, as good as any proper example of the style (that I�ve had, anyway). Crisp, clean, full-bodied mouthfeel, with a perfect dry/hoppy finish. This will now be my go-to Japanese brew, as most places (bars, stores, Izakayas) only offer beers from ""the big three"" Japanese breweries. If this brew makes its way out of Japan and onto the American/Canadian/European markets, I�m sure it will prove to be one of the better examples of the style."
Kirin Hojun;Tokyo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Another of the 60 day shelf-life chilled beers. Bottled 10/25. An amber colored brew with a medium light beige head. Fruity, meaty and malty. Floral hops, especially in the aftertaste. A well balanced beer and one of the best offerings on the crowded Japanese Macro market.

Elevator Scottish Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Scottish Ale;Elevator Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub. Poured clear brown pour with a moderate off-white fizzy head that lasted and had good lacing. Solid toasted malt, small smoke and earthy aroma. Medium body with soft carbonation. Good smokey toasted malt flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Good drinkable brew.
Elevator Scottish Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Scottish Ale;Elevator Brewing Company;Time to go to work. Pours a dark, clear amber. Looks can be decieving. Sweet malt, chocolate, and slight nut flavor on the nose. Very nice taste with sweet malt, chocolate and smoke with a strong lingering finish.
Elevator Scottish Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Scottish Ale;Elevator Brewing Company;Another seasonal from the Elevator, this beer is a dark amber color with a medium thin beige head. Thin but sticky lacing. The aroma is very malty and smoky. Medium-bodied with an intense smoke character. Malt, caramel and a bit of hops are overpowered by the smoke flavor which just about ruins the beer for some reason. The finish is lightly bitter with malt undertones and again the smoke. All in all this would be an enjoyable beer but it is not only the smokiest Scottish I have had, but probably the smokiest beer period.
Burton Old Cottage Pheasant Plucker;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Old Cottage;Cask at Birmingham University. Yellow with a very small head, making it look very much like a lager. Very malty with citrus fruits and vegetables but a slightly metallic aftertaste, which spoilt it a little. Quite refreshing.
Burton Old Cottage Pheasant Plucker;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Old Cottage;Cask Conditioned at The New Inn, Horning, Norfolk.

New Holland Dunkelweizen;Holland, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;New Holland Brewing Company;Really missing the strong banana notes in the nose, this was the first obvious thing about this beer. Dark brown with a thin head. Some banana flavors peak out as it warms, the body is decent and some fruity and cereal tastes show up. Off style, buit still a decent beer.
New Holland Dunkelweizen;Holland, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;New Holland Brewing Company;"On tap at New Holland. Dark chocolate-brown body (porter-like), topped by a thin off-white head. This beer didn�t really seem to fit the style; roasted malt and chocolate were prominent and wheat and yeast notes were sparse. As the beer warmed some of the tangy wheat component became evident and the wisp of banana esters came along with it. More like a wheat porter than a dunkelweizen."
Medovina Classic Mead - Off Dry;Niwot, Colorado, United States;Mead;Medovina Meadery;Bottle. Poured a clear gold color. Apple and honey in the nose. Medium bodied and dryish. Vanilla, honey, and apple flavors.
Medovina Classic Mead - Off Dry;Niwot, Colorado, United States;Mead;Medovina Meadery;Pours clear yellow, slightly hazy thanks to Aaron for the pour, aroma brings notes of honey, dry wine like notes, hints of earth, vanilla and some slight floral notes. Taste is a bit of sweet honey, some slight alcohol notes, going into hints of vanilla, oak, grass, some slight earth. Not bad, not tons of flavor but easy to drink.
Medovina Classic Mead - Off Dry;Niwot, Colorado, United States;Mead;Medovina Meadery;Bottle @ Dan�s house. Slightly hazy, light yellow appearance. Rashly a light honey, white wine, slightly dry finish. Light apple fruity, easy drinking, sweet, fairly dry, honey flavor. Easy drinking.
Medovina Classic Mead - Off Dry;Niwot, Colorado, United States;Mead;Medovina Meadery;750 ml bottle 2010 vintage. Clear pale yellow. Aroma was lots of floral honey and alcohol. Flavor was hot alcohol, some acidic honey and herbal spice with the smallest amount of sweetness. Light body with a dry, burning finish. This smelled great but tasted pretty harsh, age this one for years.
Medovina Classic Mead - Off Dry;Niwot, Colorado, United States;Mead;Medovina Meadery;375ml bottle, 2009. A lightly hazy yellow color, not exactly the most visually stunning, I suppose. Aroma is a bit musky, and there�s definitely some alcohol present. Flavor comes out as rather acidic and rather thin, with not a lot of honey sweetness present. I�ve had tasty dry meads, but this one just wasn�t that impressive, honestly.
Medovina Classic Mead - Off Dry;Niwot, Colorado, United States;Mead;Medovina Meadery;Bottle 06, from BFC, thanks jake.... Pours a clearish yellow no head. Aroma of alcohol and some honey. Taste is a burning alcohol, honey with an over all sweetness. Texture is dry but a little slick. I only drank about 3oz of the bottle, its just not my style.
Medovina Classic Mead - Off Dry;Niwot, Colorado, United States;Mead;Medovina Meadery;The aroma is all honey, sweetish and flowery. It is deceptive as the taste is much more complex. Honey up front, long lasting dry oak finish. Solid.

Medovina Classic Mead - Off Dry;Niwot, Colorado, United States;Mead;Medovina Meadery;This one was a cloudy yellow color. Some honey and hay in the aroma. The flavor contains honey with a bit of spice present. The palate is a little on the thin side. The alcohol really shows up in the aftertaste. Overall this was an ok mead.
Medovina Classic Mead - Off Dry;Niwot, Colorado, United States;Mead;Medovina Meadery;2004 vintage: Pours a transparent pale champaign golden with thin legs. Aroma of fresh floral honey with a touch of citrus and clover. Body starts semi-dry as the name suggests with some floral grassy notes and honey complexity. Finishes dry and warming. A pretty decent, crisp mead, but I like a little more sweetness.
New Holland Porter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Porter;New Holland Brewing Company;on tap at NH....dark brown appearance with minimal head...aroma of dark chocolate and coffee...flavor is of bitter chocolate with a touch of hops
New Holland Porter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Porter;New Holland Brewing Company;Smokey and sour nose, thin body, some thin head on a deep brown pint. Some faint coffee hints, similar strange yeastiness as the phi.
New Holland Porter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Porter;New Holland Brewing Company;On tap at New Holland. Dark brown-black body, thin-medium tan head. Body was quite chocolatey with roasted malts, toast, a hint of coffee, and bitter, almost piney hops. Lightly acidic and woody. Bordering on fruity as it warmed up. Not a bad porter.
Kernow Crusher;Cornwall, England;Apple Cider;Kernow Cider;Barrell@Red Lion BF, Isleworth, London. The standard (well it appears this way to me with most English ciders), smelly cheesy aroma, and appleskins, flat mouthfeel, a little on the sweet side, but with some tart edges. Still getting into ciders myself, but i�d call this fairly easy going traditional English cider.
Kernow Crusher;Cornwall, England;Apple Cider;Kernow Cider;Another cider producer, I can find next to nothing about. It�s presumably from Cornwall and has appeared at a couple of beer festivals, but that�s it. Cloudy golden colour. Some barnyard, but mainly apple fruit, in the aroma. Fresh and fruity flavour. Softish and on the sweet side, with hints of apricot. Not the most challenging of traditional ciders, but quite nice. From the barrel, and selling well, at the Red Lion Beer Festival, Isleworth.
Fitgers Ultraviolet Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Great fine frothy head on top of a deep golden pour. Fantastic lacing. Great looking beer! Strong general fruit aroma. Very hoppy and sharp, with the right amount of hops for me. Not too floral. Palate fades a little quickly, but seems typical of pale ales. A little yeast in the background, with malt falling behind. Nice apple finish, with a tart smack and aftertaste. A darn good American Pale if you ask me.
Fitgers Ultraviolet Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Made in honor of a local cartoonist/children�s author. Dark Amber Coloring. Lots of Hops. Found it Not to my liking...too much hops and not enough balance or smoothness.
Fitgers Ultraviolet Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fitgers Brewhouse;This was released in honor of a local artist, I believe. Dark amber color with very thin head. Powerful hop aroma grips you right off the bat. The taste is exceedingly hoppy. Not much malt balance. Very bitter. You know... I�m starting to get sick of beers with bucket loads of a single ingredient but brings nothing else to the table.
Burton Bridge Golden Flame;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Burton Bridge Brewery;Probably hit this one at just the right time (context is so important in the appreciation of beer...) after a long walk in Indian Summer conditions and it really hit the spot. Pale golden with a gentle malty aroma the first pint went down in a couple of minutes flat but I could savour the second a bit more. Has quite a thin body, certainly thinner than you would expect at 4.5% but this all added to its refreshing qualities. Finish has a slight hint of citrus but no more than that and the bitterness at this stage is surprisingly subtle. Nice beer for the summer, but not one I�d choose in the middle of winter.
Burton Bridge Golden Flame;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Burton Bridge Brewery;Cask at The Moon Under Water (JDW), Watford on 09 Jul 2012.

Burton Bridge Golden Flame;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Burton Bridge Brewery;Cask (Live and Let Live, Cambridge) (2004) Pleasant gold, small head.

North Peak Steelhead Red;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;North Peak Brewing Company;"Ruby tinted amber coloured body with a very frothy brown head. Aroma of malt and a very potent caramel flavour with tons of fresh hops! Medium-bodied; Great flavour of fresh hops, a ton of rich caramel and toffee. Good malt flavours throughout and a slight spice note at the very end. Aftertaste shows bitterness with hops predominently with a little caramel as well. Overall, a nice beer and a great one to sample first here in Northern Michigan! I sampled this pint on cask at the brewery in Traverse City, Michigan on 05-November-2010."

North Peak Steelhead Red;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;North Peak Brewing Company;"Bottle shared by awaisanen, thanks again. First off, I wouldn�t consider this an ""Amber Ale"", but a flemish sour ale. From the second I saw that this was brewed by JP, I knew I was in for a treat. The beer pours a translucent red apple red with a huge white head. The aroma is full of the sour, funky, vinegar goodness that one would expect from a flemish sour. One thing that I noticed that this brew is not nearly as spicy as JP�s other offerings, and I actually think that I enjoyed the diversity that this brew offers. I hope that Ron considers brewing and bottling a JP product similar to this. The flavor of this beer is just a bit lighter than I was expecting. The beers isn�t as sour as the aroma would lead one to believe, making it too drinkable. The finish is a bit thin and lacking flavor, but overall this is a very nice brew."
North Peak Steelhead Red;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;North Peak Brewing Company;From a 12oz Bottle. Orangey red, transparent pour with a quickly dissipating layer of white head. Aromas of under-ripe strawberries and crab-apple cider erupt from my glass, flaunting the brew�s brett character, and proudly revealing the trademark stamp that Ron Jeffries has left on this beer. The sour, grape-like tartness is balanced by a backing of caramel malt character, adding an excellent level of depth and complexity to the bouquet. Light bodied, cleanly carbonated mouthfeel. I have to admit, after being so smitten by the aroma, the flavors came off a bit disappointing by comparison - still solid, but just a bit less intense. Tastes like autumn. Fruity flavors of jazz apples with a touch of oaky chardonnay tannins. Sour, but would like to see it even more so. Remarkably easy drinking for the amount of character hidden in this little gem. Finishes with a nice dose of sour fruits spiced with a pinch of cinnimon. The finish does tend to get a touch watery, which is the only thing holding me back from giving this a four rating. What a fantastic, hidden delight. Thanks, Tom!

Motor City Motor City Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Motor City Brewing Works;Tap at HDG. Was actually most looking forward to trying this one. Damn this was a huge let-down and I still have to beleive that what was served was NOT the strong ale. No way this one was anywhere near 10%. Pours a plain amber with a thin head and dull body. Aroma is weak thin, papery, light oxidation, light metallicy caramel malts that you get from a 5% amber ale after 5 years. White wine flavor with some light metallic- some soy ox, paper, caramel sweetness. Finsihes with a watered down weak feeling and just overall dissappointing as hell. Blech. Wouldnt be surprised if this was actually the Ghettoblaster from Motor City.

Coopers Broken Hill Real Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Coopers Brewery;I had this at the Bodega in LaCrosse, WI years ago. Seemed pretty much close to a Foster�s clone, really. Nothing all that great or special.
Coopers Broken Hill Real Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Coopers Brewery;"This beer used to be called just plain ""Cooper�s Real Ale."" I had my first bottle (well, case actually) back in the early 80s. Bottle had a Kaola (sp) on it. It was a wonderful ale back then - a strong appley/yeast flavour. I have heard that they used to add a small amount of their stout (whwich is still pretty good) to this brew. Nowadays, under new management no doubt, this brew has lost all of the qualities that made it one of the best ales out there. Sigh..."
Coopers Broken Hill Real Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Coopers Brewery;Light gold. Malt aroma. Flavor of sweet malt, reminded me of a dubbel. Thicker than I expected. I would drink this again.

Coopers Broken Hill Real Ale;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Coopers Brewery;This bottled brew poured a large sized head of frothy finely sized mostly diminishing white colored bubbles that left behind a fair lacing. The body was hazy to a point of semi-opaqueness with soft carbonation and a light looking yet dark yellow color with some yeast floating around in it. The aroma was malty with horse blanket like notes. The mouth feel was smooth and flat initially with a malty hop finish that lingered around for a bit. The flavor contained notes of malt dough yeast mild hops and a bit of sweat.
Bushwakker RazzCherry Wheat;Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Bushwakker Brewing Co.;"A mixture of gold and ""pink grapefruit"" pink in colour with a little bit of wheat haze. The aromas are weighted more towards raspberry than cherry. The flavors come at you in waves: first the cherry, then the raspberry, then a little bit of yeasty and clovey wheat flavors. Carbonation (or lack thereof), was a bit of a problem. I didn�t really like this beer in the first few sips, but it grew on me as I drank more of it. I especially came to enjoy the interplay of the different fruits."
Bushwakker RazzCherry Wheat;Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Bushwakker Brewing Co.;A better than average fruit beer. The bottle poured out a hazy pinkish colour. The aroma and flavour are hard to discern exactly. I enjoyed the beer, and it had a nice refrshing tartness but I couldn�t pin down the fruit flavours.

Teme Valley Lulsley Court;Knightwick, Worcestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Teme Valley Brewery;Teme Valley makes a number of beers made with green hops from the Lulsley Court hop farm , which they owned until recently. Hazy pale gold colour. Looks rather like a farmhouse cider and, in common with the other Teme Valley green hop beers I�ve tried, has a rather farmyardy aroma. The flavour has some dry malt, but is dominated by citric hops. It is very bitter (perhaps this comes from the Pilgrim hop, which I�ve not come across before) and the finish is a little sharp but, overall, this is a reasonable crisp and refreshing beer. 500ml bottle (bottle conditioned), 2003 vintage, from orchard-hive-and-vine.co.uk. BBE 31 August 2004.
Midnight Sun K�lsch;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Draft as SBC, clear amber beer, white head. Aroma lager and malt. Taste is clean lager, malt. Palate is light. This is light and refreshing.
Midnight Sun K�lsch;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. Growler. This was poured into a stange. The appearance was a nice looking hazy to slightly transparent yellow to light orange color. A layer of white foamy head sat at the top and dissipated nicely leaving some light lacing sliding into the beer. The smell had a sweet to grassy fresh citrus blend. The taste was mainly the same leading with a fair citrus blend into the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation seemed good for the style and for me as it made up for lack of bitterness as a kolsch should. Overall, I say as a kolsch, it works. Definitely a Summer pounder.
Midnight Sun K�lsch;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Draft: Poured clear with a whispery white head. Sour grain aroma. Taste is nice corn and light sour grain. Refreshing overall.

Midnight Sun Hellesbock;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;"(Draft: Midnight Sun Brewing Co. in Anchorage, AK) Stopping in at Midnight Sun and sampling all 9 beers on tap, the Hellesbock is easily one of my favorites, and considering how excellent everything is, this is high praise indeed; It�s very malty, moderately sweet and minimally bitter, right up my alley; The nose is incredible, very malty like wort; Medium bodied with a nice, rich, smooth palate; Medium golden in color; Light tan head has excellent retention; The only bad news with this beer is that it�s a seasonal and isn�t bottled, so I�ll have to plan my visits to Alaska perfectly to have this again in the future"
Midnight Sun Camp Robber Rye Bock;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;"(Draft: Midnight Sun Brewing Co. in Anchorage, AK) Probably just a one-off, available only at the brewery; Moreso than most rye beers, the rye is clearly evident in both the nose and flavor; But it seems a little light in flavor and alcohol for a bock; Fairly spicy up front, but once the palate becomes accustomed to the rye flavor, the moderate maltiness becomes more prominent; Mild bitterness stays in the background throughout; The nose is spicy and malty; Medium body could be a little richer; Light golden in color; Light tan head has average retention, gradually fading to a small rim; Overall, this is a decent beer, but compared to the breweries high standards, this one just doesn�t excite me enough to want to have another"

Midnight Sun Arctic Rhino Coffee Porter;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Porter - Flavored;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Strong chocolate, coffee and porter aroma. A real positive. Nice dark color and very tiny bubbles of carbonation. Nice initial taste of coffee and chocolate but tends to flatten out in the finish and doesn't last long. I'd like more full mouth taste and longer finish. Not bad but could be more. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Midnight Sun Mammoth Stout II;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Stout;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewery - has a little higher ABV than their regular stout but it sits well - not noticeable. Black licorice appearance with a frothey mocha colored head. Sweet chocolatey aroma with soem espresso accents. Chocolate flavor is more pronounced and sweeter than their regular stout- almost to the point of it being an Imperial Stout. Not as dry and roasty as their regualr stout but has a much thicker mouthfeel - silky smooth. An excellent stout - they should make this a regular selection.
Midnight Sun Mammoth Stout II;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Stout;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;"(Draft: Midnight Sun Brewing Co. in Anchorage, AK) This is a completely overhauled version of their long-time Mammoth Extra Stout, totally different recipe and approach, and is a big, robust, full bodied American style stout; The flavor features a fairly strong dark roasted maltiness that is quite sweet and moderately bitter with some chocolate going on; The alcohol seems evident; It has a fairly strong bitter bite in the finish; The nose is hard to peg, being dark roasted, but not strongly so; As the beer warms, it takes on the distinct aroma of imported dried Polish mushrooms, which like Shitake mushrooms, are extremely flavorful and aromatic; Nearly full on black, but a bit of transluscent brown at the very edge; Light brown head fades to a rim; It�s almost a certainty that this will replace the disappointing Mammoth Extra Stout in the lineup, and if this indeed happens, it will be a win-win for everyone; Trying the two versions side by side, my rating alone goes from a 2.5 up to a 4.5, so that�s how dramatically different and better this version is; The only question is what to call the new Mammoth Stout (Mammoth will remain in the title somehow), and I recommend just dropping the word ""Extra"""
Midnight Sun Snagglepuss Old Ale;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Old Ale;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;"(Draft: Midnight Sun Brewing Co. in Anchorage, AK) Gary was running the tasting room this day, and he spent 2.5 hours feeding me beer after beer, and talking tirelessly and knowledgably with me about each beer I sampled; Gary, thank you, you were tremendous; In my opinion, this seasonal is definitely the best beer available for tasting in their tasting room; According to Gary, it will always be aged in wood, almost always in oak, though this particular version was aged in a bourbon barrel; The sweet, malty, alcoholic nose really grabs you, encouraging you to take a sip without any further delay; The strongly malty flavor is dark roasted and moderately bitter, but sweet, with a strong bourbon flavor and some spiciness in the finish; This is a full bodied brew with a wonderful, coating palate that is somewhat sticky; Dark brown in color and transluscent at the edges; Cream colored light tan head gradually fades to a large, thick rim; Fantastic beer that I wish was bottled, but alas, I�ll just have to have my friend in Anchorage get a few growlers to share with me when I come up to Alaska again"

Glacier Raspberry Wheat;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Glacier Brewhouse;This was a grumbler purchase from Breeze In, Juneau, AK. Its nice to see Glacier Brewhouse sending some of their brews down this way. This was poured into a pint glass every time about three and a half pours. The appearance was a hazy red color with some slight pinkness to the pour itself. A nice one finger white foamy head did appear for a good minute before it died. There was no lacing at all. The smell had red raspberries coming forth in a sour yet also a decent light sweet way. The taste was slightly balanced between the tart to sweet but more so leaning towards the tart to sour side. There was no aftertaste but it did leave a dry finish. On the palate, it sat fairly light and refreshing and showed a great sessionable quality to it. The carbonation was fairly smooth and withheld any wheat bite whatsoever. Overall, this is more of just a Raspberry Ale to me as I really didn�t get any wheat-ness anywhere. No worries, I still liked it for the most part.

The head was miserable for the style, although the lacing was good. Aroma was lemons, american wheat-ish, and some bananas. Flavor followed suit initially, although with warming, the clovey, even peppery, spicing took over as the bananas and lemons subsided. Pretty interesting brew, and the spicey character certainly compensated for the sweetness. Mouthfeel was typical if not a bit light.

Angel City Abbey;Los Angeles, California, United States;Dubbel;Angel City Brewing Company (A&S Brewing - Boston Beer Co.);"""aroma is of fruits and heavy malt, with a little yeasty zing for good measure, and alcohol. a touch too much alcohol for only 8%, but manages to be light and fruity and heavy at the same time. That goes for the flavor too. I�d have rated the flavor higher if it wasn�t quite so sweet and the alcohol was not as evident. It is a pretty smooth beer, though, and of juuuuuuust high enough quality and complexity for me to be curious about Angel City�s other beers. 8 months later...not so curious. oh well."""

Angel City Abbey;Los Angeles, California, United States;Dubbel;Angel City Brewing Company (A&S Brewing - Boston Beer Co.);Bottle from Bevmo: Created a thick fluffy topping of head and liquid is a medium brown color that both glows and shows sign of heavy sediment floating around. In the nose, there is a stale Belgian abbey ale smell as if this had made the long trip from Belgium and has been sitting a long life on the shelf, so it�s not that appetizing. The flavor has gone extremely tart and flat with no real worthy flavors found other than it is tart and makes me cringe when I take a sip. This is another beer company who doesn�t care about customers drinking spending their money on an old expired bottle, shame on them.

Taste: oxidized start, soft acidity, sweet touch, dried fruits, some caramel, more oxidation. Aftertaste: soft bitterness, spicy touch, oxidized beer. Well, we didn't have a date on the bottle, but I suppose it's safe to assume this was still the 2004 version. And it has not kept very well.

Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. What? 7.8%? Really? That doesn�t explain the thin body very well, but so be it. Otherwise it�s not too bad of a brew, but there�s also not much to recommend it. Rather plain. (making correction based on brewer website...it�s actually just over 6%, which makes more sense)
CooperSmiths Crazy Ds Thunder Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Alcoholic aroma. Not much of a head. Appearance is very light. Taste is malty enough, with a big punch of alcohol that fits the beer well. Also some serious hopping going on, mainly contributing to bitterness. Decent stuff.

Mountain Sun Swan Song;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Nitro at Vine Street - super hazy with a sticky lace that leaves rings around the glass as you drink - this brewer makes some solid ipas - very resiny, with a potent, drying bitterness that is counter-balanced by just enough sweetness and malt heft to keep it from being simply light and bitter - a lot of grapefruit pith, perhaps a tad too much, but otherwise solid.

Topbeer;Petaling Jaya, Malaysia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kick & Top Sdn Bhd;Bottled RB lists this brewed by Kick & Top Sdn Bhd but it is only Malaysian distributor, this is brewed in Indonesia (www.topbeer.net). Golden color, small white head, some lace. Ashy, woody nose. Light bodied. Some grassy, woody hops in the unbalanced malt base. They called this pilsener ... Found this beer only at one Chinese shop in Pulau Pengkor.
Topbeer;Petaling Jaya, Malaysia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kick & Top Sdn Bhd;Pooh, stinky pooh. Thin metallic and quite a serial killer, ie lots of corn, rice and unripe wheat. Good to see carbon dioxide is listed as an ingredient! Hate to think what the bottom beer was like.

Hanza Pilsener;Bielk�wko, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Amber;"A terribly artificial head tops this piss yellow monstrosity. The nose is all corn, cardboard and soured dough, and it tastes very much the same; with the corn stepping forward. Sugary but thin and sodawater spritzy. Worst of all is the dank aftertaste.

Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale;Lexington, Kentucky, United States;Strong Ale - American;Lexington Brewing & Distilling Co. (Alltech);12 oz bottle from my Brother-in-law in Danville, KY The ale poured a clear deep amber color with a small white head and very limited lacing.

Sinebrychoff Koff Draught;Kerava, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Koff Draught reminds me of how Koff III used to taste a few years ago, a little more malty aroma compared to today�s Koff III. But the difference is hardly noticable. I do not understand why Sinebrychoff makes an anniversary beer that cannot be distinguished from their normal lager.
Sinebrychoff Koff Draught;Kerava, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Very clear, golden color with small head. Slightly sweet and sugary, lightly flowery and malty aroma. Sweetish, moderately malty and slightly Koff-skunky hopped flavor. Round, light to medium-bodied palate with medium carbonation. Slightly maltier and softer than Koff III, but quite an uninteresting brew overall.
Sinebrychoff Koff Draught;Kerava, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Malty aroma with notes of sweetness. Little bit of metallic flavor is mildly disturbing, otherwise flavor is usual like in basic lagers: mildly malty and hopped. Body is somehow softer than in standard Koff III version. Crispy bite from carbonation and hops come up in the end.
Sinebrychoff Koff Draught;Kerava, Finland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);"Can (BB 02/2005) Name is misleading, ""Draught"" is the brand of beer sold in cans. Lager color, a bit darkish yellow,small white head, lace. Typical Koff nose: harsh and metallic, some sweet malts. Malty, rounded, cracker-like palate. A bit sweet flavor. Malty and bready, slightly oily aftertaste. Nothing special but more interesting than normal Koff III or IV beers."

Rock Bottom Chicago Barrel-Aged Coffee Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;Pour is black with a thin dark brown head...smell is sweet with tons of bourbon and vanilla...faint hintsof coffee, but not much...sweet vanilla and bourbon flavors...where is the coffee? Pretty interesting beer, but it was just too sweet...
Rock Bottom Chicago Barrel-Aged Coffee Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at Rock Bottom Chicago, thanks Holdenn. Dark brown to black color with medium tan head. Strong astringent coffee aroma with some chocolate and burnt malt. Flavor was a good balance of coffee and chocolate malt with some bourbon barrel. Thin body and well carbonated. I think it is interestig but lacking in body and flavor.
Rock Bottom Chicago Barrel-Aged Coffee Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;tap at RB Chicago on 1/18/08....served in a snifter....an almost black pour with a lingering tan head. points for looking pretty tasty...nose was chock-full of rich dark chocolate and loads of roasted coffee. traces of vanilla probably coming from the barrel but i can�t seem to locate any of the bourbon at all....dark chocolate and roasted coffee make up most of the flavor with some lingering bitter roast qualities that follow through to the finish. carbonation level was pretty noticeable and provided a little burn. very little detection of any barrel aging in the flavor.....a pretty nice coffee porter
Rock Bottom Chicago Barrel-Aged Coffee Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at RB � Chicago. Poured near black with a short, fairly well-retained yellowy-brown head. The aroma picked up sweet bourbon and vanilla first with nice complexity coming shortly behind.. cold medium-roast coffee hit along with aged oak chips, darker chocolate, and more vanilla.. sweet and engaging! The flavor was on par.. well-roasted coffee bitterness hit the tip of the tongue with coffee and vanilla rolling in shortly afterward.. roasty chocolate and coffee middle with light vanilla and bourbon surrounding.. long, decadent coffee and vanilla finish.. the barrel influence was low, and it worked very well. Surprisingly creamy feel on the palate with moderate carbonation.. great contrast of sharper bourbon and coffee bitterness on the back-end.. long, strong caffeinated finish. Great brew!
Rock Bottom Chicago Barrel-Aged Coffee Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;Sample on tap. Black in color with a brown head. Sweet aroma, sugary sweet, roasted coffee, alcohol, a lot like kahlua, well just like kahlua. Chocolate sweet candied flavors, green apple, bourbon, but with a light body and wow that�s hot.
Rock Bottom Chicago Barrel-Aged Coffee Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;sample on tap, black with good head. nose is extremely strong with starbucks coffe liqour aged in a bourbon barrel. mouthfeel is too thin, taste is coffee mixed with bourbon, hardly a porter. very hot, green apple too. gross.
Rock Bottom Chicago Barrel-Aged Coffee Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;Draught at the brew pub. Black, opaque. Head was tan and laced the snifter. Similar to the other barrel aged beers they had on tap, the aroma was dominated by whiskey with oak, coffee, and chocolate undertones. Flavor was similarly dominated by whiskey. Medium bodied with a warm splash of alcohol at the end.
Rock Bottom Chicago Barrel-Aged Coffee Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;Sample from tap. Melon, peach, yogurt, and cold coffee in the aroma. Thinned roast flavor - tart white chocolate, coffee, grape. Too tart to fit what the beer is trying to do. 8 3 7 4 15 Pint re-rate 1/13/2006: Black body, thin brown head that laces well. A heavy bourbon dominates the aroma but it still has a good coffee/chocolate base. I�d like to see less bourbon and perhaps more vanilla come from the barreling. The flavor tips the balance more towards tart berry-like coffee and dark chocolate with the bourbon taking up the finish. I�d like to try this coffee porter w/o the barrel.
Rock Bottom Chicago Barrel-Aged Coffee Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;On Tap @ the brewpub- Pours a pitch black, small off white head. Aroma of butterscotch, booze, bourbon. Flavor is sweet, oats, caramel, bourbon, bitter finish. Very balanced, and delicious.
Rock Bottom Chicago Barrel-Aged Coffee Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Chicago;Before I started on RateBeer, I never would�ve guessed there were so many beers brewed in my native Illinois. And now, here I am at IL rating #200 (out of 1409), and what a dandy beverage it is. It�s very dark brown, but clear, with a frothy, slightly lighter brown head. The aroma is malty sweet with roasted malt, chewy toffee, a dollop of chocolate, maple, old coffee, and lots of bourbon. Thick and vinuous, it�s loaded with a barleywine-like sweetness, roasted barley, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, a touch of smokey woodiness, and, of course, bourbon. It�s undoubtedly the barrel aging that does it, but I would have thought this was an imperial stout. Mr. Crowley had better get working on the next batch! Rock Bottom Chicago, Chicago, IL
Labatt Porter;London, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);From old tasting notes. Nearly opaque reddish brown color. Bubbly tan head. Light sweet malt nose. Zesty sweet toasted malt flavor. Flavor fades in middle. Light dry finish.
Labatt Porter;London, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);For this one, let me first say that I really like the label. Seems some 150 years went by from the time it was brewed to when it was put on the shelves. Shows a dark cola body with nice ruby highlights topped with a foamy hazel head. The nose is promising with great roasted and sweet malts and a nice dark chocolate perfume. The taste is a bit too sweet giving away the chocolate once more and some hops. It�s without question a very light brown porter that has a very light and smooth taste with almost no aftertaste. The same beer at let�s say 6.5 or 7.0 ABV would have been just out of this world since I thought it lacked the kick of the hops.

The body contained soft carbonation, was transparent and straw yellow in color. Its aroma contained notes of very mild malt hop and grass. Hmm grass.

This brew had good flavor for a low carb beer.
OHaras Sitzmark Doppel Bock;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;Smells like smelly socks. Reddish with light tan head, mostly disappating. Nice looking. Hoppier than most German lagers I�ve had. I like it a lot. A little under carbonated.

Russian River Parking Violation;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Russian River Brewing;Funny name for this beer and an appropriate homage since I�ve had a few of these in Santa Rosa over the years� It pours a pale gold color with a white head. The aroma has citrus, pine, florals a little bread. The flavor is the same. Nice citrus floral hoppiness, but a bit of a weak body. Solid bitterness. A decent pale ale, but probably one of my least favorites from RR.

Nose is actually quite hoppy - there are some nice floral elements to it that really come through. Taste isn�t too bitter, but has a nice hoppy floral taste to it. Very easy drink.
Russian River Parking Violation;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Russian River Brewing;A decent offering, well worth the money and i�d possibly get it again. Just didn�t knock my socks off. Not up to par with what i expect form RR. pretty bland, not a defined hop profile. wish i had ordered something else at the bar.

Russian River Parking Violation;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Russian River Brewing;Huge thanks to Alex (Masterski) for bringing this one over to our Friday random beer tasting. Split several ways amongst friends into nonic glasses. Love the RR growler! A - Pours golden yellowish with a couple of fingers worth of white head. Lots of sticky lacing and the head remains on top of the beer for quite some time. Just a beautiful looking APA. S - Hops, citrus, lemon/lime, light malts. T - The light malt character makes this one easy to drink, just goes down so easily. Lots of hops, citrus, lemon/lime. Light bitterness but done perfectly for an APA. M - Light, crisp, super-refreshing, good carbonation. D - I really enjoyed this one. Quite possibly my favorite APA of all-time. RR always does it right (for the most part) and I wish they were right around the corner from me. Thanks again goes to Alex through Adam for the growler!

Russian River Parking Violation;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Russian River Brewing;Growler from alex. Thanks man... Pours a hazy apple cider brown with a medium soapy white head... Grassy mellow citrusy hop, pretty tame... Flavors are a quaffable earthy citrus component without much of a bitterness. Drinkable but not as memorable. A really nice palate cleanser nonetheless. Non-obtrusive and easily imbibed.
Midnight Sun SHAB IPA;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Sampled on tap at the brewery. Has a dark orange appearance, with a frothy white head, decent lacing. Has a pronounced sprucey aroma and a citrusy hoppy flavor. Not tongue numbing bitter, balanced well with some nutty malty notes. Mouthfeel is a tad too stingy - but still a very good IPA.

Homer Old Inlet Pale Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Homer Brewing Co.;Had on tap at a restaurant on Land�s End in Homer. Amber color with a thin quickly diminishing head. Leaves proper lacing. Hoppy nose. Aroma is hoppy, with hay and floral and citrus tones. Flavour is the same with a mesh of crisp hoppy tones. Sharp finishing bitter. Body cody be more elevated. Still a very nice beer.
Homer Old Inlet Pale Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Homer Brewing Co.;[Tap] Had on tap at a restaurant in Homer. Light amber in color with a small amount of head to it. Muddled hop aroma is grassy and a bit floral. Overall the nose is pretty weak for pale ale. Tastes of a mix of citrus, pine and grassy hops. Mild and astringent grainy notes throughout. The hop profile here was a bit messy. A sharp bitterness in the finish is unpleasant. Light in body. I wasn�t a big fan of this one.
Homer Old Inlet Pale Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Homer Brewing Co.;Great pale ale! Hops and malt balanced well, with a nice hop finish. Served a little too cold to notice the aroma ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Homer Old Inlet Pale Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Homer Brewing Co.;On tap at Cafe Cups, Homer, AK. Medium straw-orange body, thin off-white head. Bready nose with floral, piny, bitter hops. Bready body, toasty and somewhat tangy with flabby bitter, spicy, herbal hops. A mediocre beer at a great restaurant.
Homer Old Inlet Pale Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Homer Brewing Co.;On tap @ Duggan�s. Cloudy light amber with a very small head. Mellow aroma with light hints of bready malt and floral hops. Flavor is very mildly sweet with a balanced bitterness. Light body, crisp but with a butterscotch finish. Not bad, just nothing special and had a hard time smelling or tasting the NW hops.
Homer Old Inlet Pale Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Homer Brewing Co.;Light sweet malts pair nicely with light floral hops. Some grassy notes in the finish. I got a kind of sugar cereal aroma from it (not unpleasant).
Homer Old Inlet Pale Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Homer Brewing Co.;"22-Jan-08 (Draft: Duggan�s Waterfront Pub in Homer, AK) Pretty much a standard American pale ale. Pale malt flavor is minimally sweet and is balanced by a moderately bitter, classic American hop flavor. Aromas are fairly light; not much hops, just some light maltiness. Light-medium in body, crisp and clean on the palate. Medium golden in color with moderate haze. Thin, off-white head settles to a sugar sprinkle film and thin ring. Nothing out of the ordinary here, but there�s nothing wrong with making a straight forward beer."
Homer Red Knot Scottish Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Homer Brewing Co.;Draft: Poured an amber with a off white head. Aroma was light malt. Taste was a sweet malt, but very thin and watery.
Homer Red Knot Scottish Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Homer Brewing Co.;Partially flat growler pour. Slightly cloudy deep amber, little head. Smell of malt and vanilla and faint fruit. Taste is pale malt, slight toasted bitterness, touch of salt, and apple juice. Very mild, light. Finish is clean and slightly sour/ bitter. Palate us a little thin, not bad. Carbonation was a bit flat, but this growler was not fresh or full. This beer will not kick you inna haid, and therefore not scottish at all. It�s mild and un imposing, and in the end, a bit boring.
Homer Red Knot Scottish Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Homer Brewing Co.;[Bottle] Had at the Salty Dawg Saloon in Homer. Apparently the brewery bottles this into Sobe bottles and slaps their own label on top. Pours a muddy brown color with a soapy looking head. The nose is of caramel and sweet toffee. The taste is very similar. Sweet breads and mild cinnamon notes. Distinct grainy notes as well. Not much of a �scottish� feel to it. Light palate and undercarbonated (maybe cause it�s in a Sobe bottle??). Not bad, but not great either.
Homer Red Knot Scottish Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Homer Brewing Co.;"On tap at Christo�s Palace, Seward. Murky medium orange-brown body, thick to medium puffy tight beige head. Caramely nose with toast and sweet berries. Sharply carbonated body; tangy, bitter, and cerealy, with toasted Cheerios and brown sugar notes. Pretty good."
Homer Red Knot Scottish Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Homer Brewing Co.;On tap @ Duggan�s. Cloudy amber with a small head. Almost no aroma. Mostly sweet flavor with some very light sourness from the yeast. Medium to light body, watery thin mouth feel and average carbonation. Somewhat bland to the senses overall.
Homer Red Knot Scottish Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Homer Brewing Co.;"23-Jan-08 (Draft: Homer Brewing Co. in Homer, AK) Described by the brewer as a ""user friendly beer"", Red Knot is a very easy drinking beer and their best seller. Malts are dry, toasty and slightly caramely in flavor, and hops are very light and far in the background. Slightly caramely nose with no hops, but a lightly spicy yeast aroma comes out too. On the palate, the beer is medium in body with soft carbonation. Foamy, off-white head rises to a quarter-inch before settling to a filmy and bubbly layer with a small ring. Some patchy lacing. Definitely a beer targeted for the general public, and for that purpose, it�s more than adequate."
Homer Red Knot Scottish Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Homer Brewing Co.;The Homer Brewing company is one of my favorite local breweries. Almost every single beer it produces is excellent. I�m usually not a huge fan of red beers, but this is one of my faovites.
Homer Red Knot Scottish Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Homer Brewing Co.;had during a trip to alaska. was hoping for more alcohol in this one. some fruit and hops. nice but needs more bite for these cold alaskans!
Homer Red Knot Scottish Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Homer Brewing Co.;On tap at the �06 Great Alaska Beer and Barley Wine Festival. Muddy orange beer with a thin tan head. It has a sweet grain nose with something almost smikey in it. Watery beer with some smoky grains and a faintly lactic acidity to it. It disappears on the palate. It was not a good beer.
Homer Red Knot Scottish Ale;Homer, Alaska, United States;Scottish Ale;Homer Brewing Co.;"Basically, I�d sum the beers of Homer Brewing Co. with: ""Boring, but not bad, but always a very nice palate."" Or something like that. This was the worst example I had from the brewery. Had almost no aroma and too much bitterness, but it was drinkable so thats good enough for me I guess."

Magic Hat Batch 370 (Hefeweizen);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"12oz bottle. First ""retired"" beer for me...it was sitting around in my friend�s cupboard, I don�t remember a label on it. Good head, standard for the style. Taste is a little spicy, a little on the tart and dry side, actually. Almost lemon-y. Not the worst hefe- I�ve had, but I can see why they retired it."
Magic Hat Batch 370 (Hefeweizen);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);One of my first wheat beers. Great thick golden pour that leads to a thick foamy head. Apperance was great, just like a hefeweizen should look, cloudy with post fermentation floating amongst the low CO2 bubbles. Taste was slick yet, delicious. Light palate and low bitterness. Definitely a great wheat beer to start on.
Magic Hat Batch 370 (Hefeweizen);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"bleh! amber golden pour; wheat aroma - in my mind the hefe should be a thirst quencher, easy to drink with a little citrus. This is none of those. only positive is a med thick palate (for the style). passsssss."

Magic Hat Batch 370 (Hefeweizen);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Nothing special, very average attempt at recreating an echt German hefeweizen. Bland, with a hint of unwelcoming bitterness.
Magic Hat Batch 370 (Hefeweizen);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);I couldn�t detect any wheat character in this beer other than a slight tartness. The traditional yeasty esters were absent as if a standard ale yeast was used. Poured nice with a good head but I drink a hefe for the yeasty aroma and flavor.
Magic Hat Batch 370 (Hefeweizen);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"served at NYC Brewtopiafest. at this point in the festival, we had had enough to elicit some pretty funny commentary. My friend Wendy says that this concoction ""smells a little like beer."" and she would be right. but it also smells of interesting earthy aromas, dirt, manuer, cloves and banana. it tastes earthy, of dirt, grass and straw and there are equal bouts of cloves, banana and bubblegum. I like the raw and musky quality to it. really interesting though not necessarily one I�d want to sip and enjoy. good one guys..."
Magic Hat Batch 370 (Hefeweizen);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);(bottle - 12 oz) Cloudy orange color with not much of a head. Light aroma of sour wheat, some orange and banana and grass. Doesn�t really smell like a normal hefe. Flavor is a lot of wheat, grass, straw, bananas and something really bitter. Alcohol is very detectable and the body is very thin.
Magic Hat CuriouserAle;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Bomber, as ""CuriouserAle"". Unfiltered, thick orange-salmon color; aromatic, spicy, only slightly fruity nose, hints of juniper. Very distinctive, sourish flavor, spicy and heavily carbonated...I would say, at first bite, more herbal/vegetal than fruity; definitely not over-sweet like many in the style; quite interesting if not exactly great."
Magic Hat CuriouserAle;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Wheat is noticeable in the aroma but fresh raspberries are the star. Opaque rose coloured with slight white head that recedes (perhaps the fruit impedes head retention). Slightly tart raspberries with plenty of wheat character. Same medium body with fluffy, wheaty, mouthfeel and lively carbonation as the regular hefe. All in all, the fresh strong raspberry flavour and aroma make this very enjoyable. On tap at the brewery (during Vermont Brewers Fest 2004).

Two Rivers Light;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Fort Garry Brewing;Pours a pale gold. Very little head. Hardly any flavour. A pale immitation to the non-light version of this lager.
Two Rivers Red;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fort Garry Brewing;355ml can pours a pale amber color with a large white head that settles as quickly as it is poured. Aroma is mild caramel and grass with some skunk. Taste is caramel malty sweetness with some nasty hop bitterness and sour finish. Definitely, below average for the style and would not recommend to anyone.
Two Rivers Red;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fort Garry Brewing;Pours clear ruby red with white head, aroma has notes of some roast and toffee notes. Taste is pretty thin but has nice flavors, with notes of toffee, some roast, some weird sourness, and a slightly dry and sweet finish.
Two Rivers Red;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fort Garry Brewing;Don�t know what batch some of the other Alberta reviewers got ahold of. Bottle. 5%. Boring tasting reddish lager. Nice colouring, but with a weak whitish/brown foam. The taste is nothing to write home about, fairly grainy and sweet, with a hint of toffee. Drinkable, but nothing special.
Two Rivers Red;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fort Garry Brewing;***review from May 6, 2008*** HORRID BEER! DO NOT PURCHACE THIS DISGUSTING GARBAGE. Poured out a deep amber brew with a big rocky head that was dying quicker than I could pour. What remains resembles road rash with hydrogen peroxide poured on. The smell is rank: sour, chems, dry and brutal. The taste is sour and horrible. Oddly enough it did not make it to the drain as I decided to torture myself and finish this poison off. Harsh malts, corn, mild grass. The flavour keeps changing every sip with more bad flavours. I�ve had this twice and each time it has been terrible.
Two Rivers Red;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fort Garry Brewing;"Reddish brown body, crystal clear almost looks fake its so clear, a two inch tall rocky head was produced, this is one noisy head sound like rice crispies. Wholly crap worst smelling beer in history, my god, sour metallic, completely nasty, and something that I can only described as rotting yeast is attacking my nose, why is two the lowest number this thing needs to go negative. Strange there is no taste but it taste exactly like the smell but like nothing at the same time how is that possible? There is a rotten egg well water quality in the flavor, the beer is crap, even the mouth fell is slimy and flat and the beer leaves this buttery after taste. This is some of the worst swill I�ve ever drunk, but it didn�t get the dump into the sink. SWILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
Two Rivers Red;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fort Garry Brewing;Red amber, very brief white head. Faintly fruity caramel, with some accompanying wet dog stink. Sweet caramel, faintly fruity, watery. Quite plain in the end.
Two Rivers Red;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fort Garry Brewing;341ml bottle. Pours an amber brown with a small, fizzy white head that doesn�t stick around very long. Not really red. Smells of some caramel, fermentation and wine. This beer has a quite carbonated biting feel. Taste is lightly fruity with a bit of hop character upfront. Ends with a caramely note and a bit of that wine coming back for a visit. Overall watery flavour.
Two Rivers Red;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fort Garry Brewing;"Bottle (341ml). Via trade with Oakbluff. Poured clear ruby-amber with a a small quick-fading off-white head. Very mild aroma - sweet lightly caramel malt, hint of perfume hops, nothing to really describe, really - perhaps a little sugary? The taste is vaguely fruity, slightly scorched malt, some bitterness - like a cheap, watered down bock. Watery, still, slightly burnt sugary mouthfeel, quickly fading to a slight burnt sugar aftertaste - not horrid, but not much of a ""dark"" - at least it�s fairly clean (no corn)."
Two Rivers Red;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fort Garry Brewing;"Can ( Thanks Kris) Pours a deep burnished copper-red lager in my Glass. 2 finger rocky off-white cap lasts a few min then reduced to a ring that lightly laces the glass. Aromas are flat and cardboard-like I get brewers adjuncts and caramel..nose is unpronounced. Thinish body, thin mouth feel and sweet extract character. Light crystal malts up front, hops are really peared back in this..almost non existsnt then there is a waft of brewer�s caramel that hits you mid palate...finished clean and sweet but the sweetness seems synthetic not like a honey or demerara or malt sweetness...light ""char"" in the after taste. A beer certainly focused at mass market, but not very well crafted..about on par with the national macros...not bad tasting, just not good. I think this is a fast spun extract and adjuct beer...inoffensive but really forgetable."
Two Rivers Red;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fort Garry Brewing;Started out with a nice head but I turned my head and it was gone. Now it looks flat. Reddish copper colour. Thin aroms with a trace of sweet malt. Winnipeg�s take on Big Rock Traditional or Rickard�s Red. Seems to have a bit more body. Light sweet caramel malt and a bit of grain. The can was a bonus from Piscator34.

Fort Garry Stone Cold Draft;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Fort Garry Brewing;Epic. 2 litter plastic bottle. Pours a clear golden with white head. Aroma of corn, fun and disease.

Fort Garry Stone Cold Draft;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Fort Garry Brewing;Bottle shared with Northopfrye. A 2L Bottle. Classy. Pours a pale yellow. No aroma at first - but as it warms - some apple cider comes through - a bit of butter too. Similar flavours, but off-putting finish. Boozy. Not that good.
Fort Garry Stone Cold Draft;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Fort Garry Brewing;Kind of sweet, bready aroma, and when it�s warm a bit of bubblegum. Pale yellow colour. Taste is sweet and watery. Comes in a plastic bottle. Not great.
Fort Garry Stone Cold Draft;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Fort Garry Brewing;2L brown plastic bottle pours a pale golden orange color with a finger of white head that settles quickly leaving only a small trace of lacing on the glass.

Fort Garry Stone Cold Draft;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Fort Garry Brewing;500 ml can. Clear gold with medium head. Good carbonation. Not much of a an aroma other than very light malts. Same for the taste though sweet with fruity hints. Nothing to write home about but the beer is smooth and the carbonation makes a good palate cleanser for a hot night and greasy food.
Fort Garry Stone Cold Draft;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Fort Garry Brewing;473 ml can Unclear yellow orange, thin white head. Vague aroma of sewage. Metalic malt liquor-ish taste. No hops. Drainpour finish. Very bad. The convenient and economical 2 Litre PET bottle must go over big in the trailer parks. LBW (Lagerboys Be Wary)
Fort Garry Stone Cold Draft;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Fort Garry Brewing;"This beer tastes the bottom of a bottle the ENTIRE time. I had one huge glass from a 2 litre bottle and I could barely get it down. 12 hours later my stomach still hurts. I�m pretty sure rat poison would taste better. I wouldn�t drink this ""beer"" again even if it was free."
Fort Garry Stone Cold Draft;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Fort Garry Brewing;Can, purchased in Kelowna and consumed at the lake. Golden yellow, white head, blah blah blah.

Fort Garry Stone Cold Draft;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Fort Garry Brewing;Single can purchased from roadside liquor store in Vernon, BC on 03/10/2011. Colour: light, light orange with low head. Nose: Cheap malt, doughnut, some pepprer. Taste: Medium sweet, light bitter, light sour. Sugary dominance accompanied by nothing. Booooo. Creamy mouth feel saves complete disaster.
Tower Thomas Salts Bitter;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tower Brewery;Cask conditioned @ South Western Arms, Soton. Not much going on in the aroma. Very little malt flavour to this which contributes to the thin almost watery body. Some peppery hop bitterness in the finish which isnt enough to overbalance the beer but is about the only thing happening here. On the plus side leave a nice fresh feeling in the mouth after its gone.
Tower Thomas Salts Bitter;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tower Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Metropolitan Centre, Bury 18/11/2005 Golden amber coloured with a slightly sweet honey taste. Some dryness and subtle bitterness in the lasting malt finish.
Tower Thomas Salts Bitter;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tower Brewery;There�s a dab of fruit in the aroma. But generally, its quite dry and bitter. But I found it excessively sharp and astringent. Which is odd because I usually don�t have any problems with that. Maybe a bit on the green side. Cask, Battersea Beer Festival, February 2005.
Tower Thomas Salts Bitter;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tower Brewery;Melon aroma, with a hint of cucumber! Sweet, fruit salad flavour. Golden in colour. Medium bodied. Not bad.
Tower Thomas Salts Bitter;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tower Brewery;Cask@Battersea Beer festival. Some rockmelon and cucumber in the aroma. There some undeveloped malt in the flavour. Quite dry and medium bitter. I don�t know if it was anything to do with freshness, but this was pretty flabby and dull.
Tower Thomas Salts Bitter;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tower Brewery;Cask Conditioned at The Great Western Arms, Deppers Bridge, Warks. Yellow amber with healthy lace head. A simple, straightforward, down to earth bitter. Sulphery, too strongly flavoured to be a session beer, but spritey and sharp. Decent beer.
Church End Brams Birthday Bitter;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Church End Brewery;Cask Conditioned at The Great Western Arms, Deppers Bridge, Warks. Brown amber beer with bubbly, short head. This is a grainy, malt bitter with a taste of green barley. A little sweet as though there has been a short brew. Steady hop flavour though a little understated.
Bells IPA;Leicester, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bells Brewery (UK);Bottle. Must say not my type of IPA, lacking floral hops. Pretty straight dry hops and not overwhelming. Faintest hint of Malt, oily, did pour with a nice head, cloudy yellow gold color. Did finish clean but really not much finish at all.
Bells IPA;Leicester, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bells Brewery (UK);Cask Conditioned at Harbury Beer Festival �04. Yello amber, slight head. Juicy fresh fruity bitter, not really an IPA in the true sense. Understated flavours, ideal as a session bitter, easy drinking. Particularly fresh btter finish, well balanced.
Brewster's Rutterkin;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Weak golden colour. Light, frothy head when pulled using a sparkler. Zesty citrus aroma and taste. Pleasant, sharp bitterness left on the roof of my mouth. Not quite as good as Pale rider but still a good ale.
Brewster's Rutterkin;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);"Cask at Edward Rayne (JDW), Raynes Park in Jan 2019 - Clear yellowy gold with a good foamy white head. Good condition. Excellent lacing. Fruity; juicy citrus grapefruit and lemon, peel. Hoppy; moderate hop bitterness, citrusy hops. Malty; grainy malts. Bitter citrus fruity hoppy throughout. Lingering citrus bitterness. Nice Gold. Good bitterness. Enjoyed this. (2019-01)"
Brewster's Rutterkin;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);"29th Jan 2019; cask, third of a pint in The Red Lion and Pineapple, Acton. Golden body, off-white crown. Floral and light citrus aroma, taste is a blend of semi-sweet maltiness and slightly bittering citrus hoppiness."
Brewster's Rutterkin;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);"Cask at the Geldart, Cambridge. Mid-golden with a loose white head. Very little aroma at first; further sniffing reveals some passionfruit and banana esters. A pronounced bitterness crashes the tropical fruity sweetness party. This beer has a nice balance, even as the bitterness overtakes completely in the long finish. Light notes of banana, cantaloupe and marshmallow offset the intensity in the aftertaste. Flawed but interests nonetheless. There�s a fair bit of character once you scratch the surface."
Brewster's Rutterkin;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Tasted this in the Salt Cot, Saltcoats (JDW) on the 27th August 2016. Cask, handpump dispense. Opaque straw in colour with a thin white head. Thin malty aroma with light elderflower notes. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives a light biscuit base with tart sweet tangerine fruit. Floral dusty hops gives a clean citrus bite to the bitter aftertaste. Finish is balanced with malt just edging it with dry elements of citrus peel coming through in the mouth. A standard Golden Ale.
Brewster's Rutterkin;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Cask HP at The Crosse Keys Bishopsgate as Brewsters Rutterkin. Golden orange, still, clear, foamy off white head. Aroma is mango and soft cheese, soap. Body is smooth, low carbonation. Taste is light malt sugars, tangerine, straw, faintly tangy with a soft resinous astringency. Overall, it�s an ok golden ale.

Brewster's Rutterkin;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Tap at the Pump House, Shirley, Solihull. Poured a hazy straw colour with a frothy white head and loads of clingy lace. The aroma is grassy hop, some yeast and citrus. The flavour is moderate bitter with a dry pepper spice, citrus, grassy hop bitter palate and a lingering bitter finish. Medium bodied with soft carbonation.
Langton House Special;Thorpe Langton, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Langton Brewery;Cask Conditioned at Harbury Beer Fest �04. Pale amber with foamy head. Beatiful characterful hoppy dry bitter. The beauty of this beer is its simplicity, good old fashioned Maris Otter malt and a straight Fuggles hop, leaves you with a perfect straightforward bitter. I loved this beer.
Rockingham Machu Pichu Porter;Elton, Northamptonshire, England;Porter;Rockingham Ales;Cask (Peterborough Beer Festival 2004) Almost black, thin head. Made with added coffee beans. Something wrong with the combination - a little schizophrenic. Maybe a competent porter trying to get out somewhere.
Rockingham Machu Pichu Porter;Elton, Northamptonshire, England;Porter;Rockingham Ales;Cask Conditioned at Harbury Beer Festival �04. Black with brown hue, no head. Strange beer this one, made with immersing Peruvian Coffee beans into the brew. Not my cup of tea (or coffee) but marks for trying. The coffee flavour is obvious but in a sweetish way. Some fruit notes too.
Shugborough How Decadent?;Shugborough, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Shugborough (Titanic);Cask Conditioned at Harbury Beer Festival �04. Light amber with thin head. Slight beer, thinly flavoured saved by a lasting bitterness. Some peppery hops and grainy malt.
Caulier Perle;P�ruwelz, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Caulier;Deep golden lager hopped with Perle. Pure malty character, soft and uncompromised, bit caramelly malt sweetness, medium full mouthfeel especially for its style, hoppiness subdued, light and grassy but not becoming actually bitter. Better than the mass-marketed lagers we all know and loathe.
Caulier Perle;P�ruwelz, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Caulier;Draught at Belgian Beer Weekend 2005, Brussels, Belgium A sparkling, yellow body with a fully lasting, white head. Excellent lace. Moderately bitter initial flavour, lightly bitter finish (averagily long). Soft carbonation. It�s a nice example of it�s style, but not that special concerned in the battle with the beers from all the styles.
Caulier Perle;P�ruwelz, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Caulier;(draught) Deep gold: too large, off-white head, leaving lace. Very malty nose, like entering a working brewery. Again, top-malty, fresh pale malts to the fore. Hops are there, but remain in the background. Medium rather than light bodied. Bit dry aftertaste, yet quite refreshing. A pilsener for the malt heads. If you�re into the typical malty Pilseners, this is the one for you. Quite OK in its style.
Omer Vander Ghinste Ypra;Bellegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);"Tasted from tap at the Brussels Beer Weekend of 2010, not sure if it has been continued afterwards; this was Bockor�s first top-fermented specialty beer, a forerunner of their Omer which enjoys popularity nowadays and apparently taken from a long discontinued brewery. Hazy golden blonde beer with very thick, snow white head and fruity yeast character (banana, apple, peach) on a soft malt sweetish background and very light spicy accents; sweetish and yeasty but otherwise rather neutral, with light herbal hop bitterness in the finish. Omer is definitely an improvement compared with this."
Omer Vander Ghinste Ypra;Bellegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Darker blond coloured beer with some very light carbonation and a medium white head. Slightly fruity and yeasty hinted aroma. Medium to full palate. Finish has some malty hints with a short fruity yeasty ending. Not bad.
Omer Vander Ghinste Ypra;Bellegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Bottle. Hazy golden coloured with a medium sized white head. Fruity aroma of spices with notes of yeast. Fruity flavour of spices with notes of yeast and hops. Spicy and hoppy finish.
Omer Vander Ghinste Ypra;Bellegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Draught @ Brussels Beer Weekend, Grand Place, Brussels, Belgium. Unclear medium to dark orange color with a large, frothy to creamy, good lacing, mostly to fully lasting, off-white to white head. Aroma is moderate to heavy malty, toasted, caramel, moderate yeasty, spicy, metalic. Flavor is light heavy sweet and bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20090906]
Omer Vander Ghinste Ypra;Bellegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);From tap at Grand Place. Pours hazy orange with a lacing white head. Aroma is mild wheaty and light spiced. Mild phenolic and wheaty dry flavorued. Lingering coriander spiced note. Dry and light bitter finish.
Omer Vander Ghinste Ypra;Bellegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Sampled at the Resto Grill De Trompet in Ieper, usual blonde style ale with some elevated alcohol levels. Some spices, but too mild in that category to be a great beer. The flavor was somewhat sweet, but not too thick of a mouthfeel or richness. As much a session beer as one could be at these higher ABV and sweetness/richness levels. A nice local Ieper beer.
Omer Vander Ghinste Ypra;Bellegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);"Ridicously (unless for the brewer) high yellow-peach head, leaving lace; orange-gold beer. Bit soapy nose, garden herbs (chervil), gassy. Surprisingly fruity (citrussy, or peach/nectarine), obviously from the yeast, as yeasty components, like meaty notes, abund in the beer. Tastes very young. Light to medium bodied. Filterered, but the feel is quite yeast)oriented, creamy. Aftertaste is sweet. I�m not impressed. Too neutral-sweet by half. This seems the retaking of an abandonned name."

Liefmans Fruitesse Pomme;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Slightly hazy gold pour. Apple juice aroma. Taste is slightly sweet, lots of apple again. Fine for a dessert or to share but not the best quality.
Liefmans Fruitesse Pomme;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Apple beer in the former Fruitesse series with which Riva tried to exploit the Liefmans brand. Golden blonde, hazy beer which smelled and tasted like apple juice and apple cider, but not much else. Sweet, sugary apple taste with sourish notes, �unbeery�. Never liked witbier-based fruit beers and this one wasn�t any different.
Liefmans Fruitesse Pomme;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Originally rated February 2008. Comes in a tin bottle with 03/2010 written on bottle cap. Pours a light golden colour with a small white head and lots of tiny flakes floating through it. Lacing is decent all-around, and the carbonation is low. The aromas are like apple juice with mild honey. Says it contains 25% apple juice. The taste is quite different from what I expected. The apple is present, but not like the usual apple beers where it taste like fake apples. The flavours also has a touch of pineapple and slight nut. I also taste a little mint in there. Still, a refreshing light fruit beer with a mouthfeel that is not sticky.
Liefmans Fruitesse Pomme;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);27th December 2005 Early amateur rating warning! Sweet apple beer, very drinkable. Perhaps a bit too sweet.
Liefmans Fruitesse Pomme;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Can: Poured a fizzy light yellow color beer with a small foamy head. Taste of fructose and apple is refreshing though more akin to apple syrup then actual apples. Taste is very sweet with some fake apple taste. Refreshing but not something I would wish to have again.
Liefmans Fruitesse Pomme;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);0.25 l bottle. Golden color. Sweet perfumed apple aroma with notes of almonds. Sweet slightly acidic and candyish apple flavor. Almost like a sweet cider.
Liefmans Fruitesse Pomme;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottled, 330ml from Hopduvel Warehouse, Ghent. Yellow gold with white head. Sometimes you know something isn�t going to work, but you still go for it and this is certainly a case for me. It was an amalgam of all the characters I don�t like to get in a beer all in one, cidery apple, sweetness, chemical notes and an odd almond note. Poor.
Liefmans Fruitesse Pomme;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle. Medium head with medium duration. Color is golden. Aroma and taste are malt, ripe apples and lots of apple juice.
Liefmans Fruitesse Pomme;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottled. A hazy light golden beer with a thin off-white head. The aroma is sweet malty with strong notes of apples. The flavor is sweet with very strong notes of apples as well as subdued notes of malt, leading to a dry finish. Not really me.
Florisgaarden Cactus;Melle, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Huyghe;Tap at delirium cafe Strasbourg. Nose is lime, citrus, some cactus. Palate is lime juice, some fake citrus flavours. This is a glorified radler, not a great one at that.
Mandarin Mortal;Jamagne, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie Mortals Beers;Mandarin beer (the only one I know of) with thin, snow white, coarse head and very pale yellow blonde colour with somewhat greenish hue, clear but hazy after adding the deposit, little sparkling but some large protein flakes show up in the end. Aroma of Mandarine Napol�on, apple peel, peach, gooseberry, rubber and cough syrup. Delicate sweetness in the onset (vanilla?) with a delicate, lively and incentive perfume of mandarin liqueur rather than real mandarins, light and smooth maltiness, low carbo and thin mouthfeel, light sourishness, finish with very weak floral hoppiness, not bitter at all, dryish and medicinal and otherwise rather watery. Another strange Mortal�s concoction, too bad they don�t exist anymore - I, for one, miss this brewery.

Sonnenbr�u Ebermannstadt Keller-Bier;Ebermannstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei-Gasthof Sonne (Sonnenbr�u);"Bought at Biershop-Bayern: Sonnenbr�u Keller-Bier. On the bottle�s back label it states, ""classically brewed following the Reinheitsgebot of 1516 using aroma hops and Fr�nkishe (Franconian) brewing barley."" This place is more of a Gasthof/Hotel/Restaurant, and their website gives zero info about their beers. There also seems to be plethora of Sonnenbr�us in Germany, like in M�rsbach, in Lichtenberg, and Rebstein in Switzerland. I guess what makes it a Kellerbier is that it�s Hefetr�b, or yeast-cloudy. Anyway, it�s 5%, yellow-tinged light amber color, perfectly clear, so don�t understand the ""cloudy"" part on the label. my usual indication of the use of either M�nchner/Melanoiden malts. The aroma is both little bread-malty & lightly hoppy, so they were right on the aroma hops, probably Tettnanger, Hersbr�cker or another noble hop. The taste is both malty and lightly noble-hoppy, nothing terribly wowing, but really really easy to drink. There�s no one flavor that overpowers, and they blend together very well! Also the mouthfeel is neither too thick or too thin, maybe exactly in the Goldilocks zone needed to make a very s�ffige (pleasant to drink, drinkable), creamy beer. Damn, I�m usually not a Pils fan, but this is maltier than a Pils and less hoppy than, too. But then again, the warmer it gets, the bitterer the aftertaste. I can really dig this beer."

The sweetness built and built as a kept sipping this one becoming like a toasted, caramel-like tone.

AMAZING"
De Dolle Dulle Teve Special Reserva 2004;Diksmuide, Belgium;Tripel;De Dolle Brouwers;11.2oz bottle, 2003 vintage, shared by Dickinsonbeer--thanks Paul! Clear caramel orange with a small off-white head, fading to a thick fizzy ring before long. There is some oxidation, but is still yeasty and fruity with some nice light apple brandy and wood notes, toasted malt behind. Flavor follows suit with stronger booziness. Some caramel is also present, the finish dry with bitterness at a 4. Medium body with low prickly carbonation. Pretty tasty, and has held up quite well.

F�r ein Pilsner zu f�llig im K�rper und zu wenig rezent, fast schon schal, aber vielleicht nur schlecht gezapft.

Rheinsberger Kronprinzen Pils;Rheinsberg, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Gasthausbrauerei Zum Alten Brauhaus Rheinsberg;"Deep blond color; hazy. The aroma shows some malt, more than the average German bottled beer, and hay. Instead the flavor brings back to the tradition of poor bottled beers, dry mouthfeel, light hay flavor and maybe very light caramel too. Ordinary bitterness."

Weeping Radish Uber Pils;Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;On tap at the Manteo pub. Deep golden color with a big white head. Nice citrus hop nose. Lots of citrus flavors with grapefruit and orange rind notes. Clean, crisp beer with lots of hops.
Brick House Hurricane Kitty Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Stopped at this nice little brewpub in long island. Unable to get good tasting notes because had to catch the ferry. Staff was very nice and the beers was enjoyable. Very nice food too.

Brick House Hurricane Kitty Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Pours a clear medium to light orange with little lacing. Noted of grapefruit and a faint hint of pine. Slightly stale hops.
Brick House Hurricane Kitty Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Taste like an ok IPA. Surprisingly medium mouthfeel but hoppy finish. Nothing extraodinary kinda of one note but not bad. Would rave about it though.
Brick House Hurricane Kitty Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub. Arrived at the table a hazy amber with a thin linen white head that lasted through the first two or three sips and left very little lace. Surprisingly light aroma of Cascade hops. The flavor is decidedly hoppy with lots of Cascade hops. There is a trace of malt present, but that�s about it. Bitter hoppy finish. A bit harsh and very one-dimensional.
Brick House Hurricane Kitty Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Tap at the brewery. Poured a dark amber with a thin white head. This had a light hop nose. The flavor was not light though, and I was pleasantly surprised. This was the non sweet floral hops, more of the down and dirty variety, but very tasty with a solid malt base that created some nice balance. This is a solid beer, wit a nice bitter finish, not too strong, and not too long, but a nice lingering flavor. A real nice surprise.
Brick House Hurricane Kitty Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;nice cascade hop aroma and flavor with some malts well blended with a nice bitter ending
Brick House Hurricane Kitty Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Reviewed on 8/9/08. On tap at the brewpub. Pours a dark orange with a small white head. Aroma of light citrus and bitter hops. Flavor is dominated by the bitter hops with no real malt backbone. Definitely an IPA, not an APA. But in any case, not one I�ll be revisiting, like, ever. 5/4/4/2/9 (2.4/5) Rerate 1/31/09: I guess I�ll have to eat my words. Went back to BrickHouse and tried this again. I don�t know why it was so different, but it was. Pours a cloudy orange with a thick white head. Aroma of floral and citrus hops. Flavor of a bitter hoppy finish with tropical fruits in the body. Nicely hopped. Palate is slightly harsh, but it�s easy drinking nonetheless. I really enjoyed this one! 8/4/7/4/15 (3.8/5)
Brick House Hurricane Kitty Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub. Aroma of some malt but mostly floral-ish hops. Flavor just a barrel of bitter hops and water. Yuck.
Brick House Hurricane Kitty Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Good beer. It was very hopy, I would have thought it was an IPA, but either way it was very good.
Brick House Hurricane Kitty Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;My notes for the night about this one simply read �HOPS!� I never write exclamation points. This beer smells and tastes of hops. It even kind of looks and feels like you would expect hops to. Everything about this beer is hops, which can make it a little overpowering. If you are going to be at the Brick House save this for the end of your night of tasting because its flavor will stay with you for a while.
Brick House Main Street Light;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Dark gold and clear. Hoppy dry finish. Clean and plent of body and taste for a light beer. Nice.

Brick House Main Street Light;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Pours a golden clear yellow with little lacing. Notes of cereal and hay. Stellar for a light session beer.
Brick House Main Street Light;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Draught. Pours a crystal clear gold with a thin-moderate soapy white head that lasted through the first three sips and left very little lace. Aroma of bready malt and some hops. The flavor is very light malt and some grassy hops. A biscuit flavor emerges in the aftertaste and lingers for quite a while afterwards. Light bodied. Medium bitterness. Better than most light beers out there.
Brick House Main Street Light;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Not bad for a light beer. The Brick House has some better choices though, so I would recommend something else.
Brick House Main Street Light;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;I was really worried about this as it seems to be the general �Bud Light� that is often produced by brewers just to stay in business. Then again, my steryotype was wrong about the Brooklyn lager, so I was hoping for it to be wrong here. The Main Street Light was rather light, as the name would imply, but was also rather fruity and sweet. This beer is by no means �bad�, but it is just your average, boiler plate lager. If you frequent the Brickhouse, try it eventually, if not, save the money, calories and liver on something else.
Brick House Main Street Light;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Not my favorite of their beers but this beer poured light yellow and offered notes of yeast, light malt, and light hops accross the boars. It finishes crisp and clean.
Brick House Main Street Light;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Just a plain light lager really. Nothing too exciting about it. Very reminiscent of Rolling Rock but with a bit more taste and less clean.
Brick House Main Street Light;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Tap. Clear golden color. Aroma is malty with notes of apple cider. Malty, grainy and sweet flavors. Drinkable and would be a good sub for a lighter styled commercial beer drinker.
Brick House Main Street Light;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;this beer is light --that�s for sure. not much to say about it after that. Very boring .
Redoak Wee Heavy;Sydney, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"2007 bottle at RedOak. Dark cola brown, coat of beige head with nice lacing. Very fine peated aroma with seaweed, dark sugars, amontillado sherry, caramel. Tastes along much the same lines. Quite peaty and smokey; dried fruit with the caramel. Rather sharp bitterness. Fine aroma but that little bit of sharpness and oxidation with the bitterness doesn�t quite work at the end. After the sharpness fades, a long, dry, peaty, kind of oaky finish. It�s pretty good. Still a little overcarbonated even though it�s from 2007 and pretty boozy too. Complex and clearly has some improvement left in it."
Redoak Wee Heavy;Sydney, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Tasting from Jan� 2009. Into a chalice at cellar temperature. A few clumps of yeast proteins settle quickly on the base otherwise the beer is translucent. A shimmering deep ruby red with copper tinges in the shallow. Sits quite still, head merely formed due to the pour quickly fades back to a dense, compact, but thin tannish pad. Baked rhubarb and rich leather hit the nose first, sultanas, prunes d�agen, ash and cigarette smoke, a little �corked� red wine and heather, this has an alluring, complex aroma that is full and tickles the olfactories. thick, silky mouthfeel, heavily peaty with some robust smoked malts delivering ashen and smoked meat flavours. More rhubarb pie and prunes, some bitter tangy raisins all encompassed by rich chocolate. The peak is mildly malty bitter with layers of savoury fruit, peat and smoke into the intensely long swallow. Shows notes of leather and rust in the aftertaste also, the alcohol remaining sadly well hidden. Just gets better as it empties, I�d love to get my hands on a few more of these to cellar away for a while. Easily my favourite of the Redoak beers, a very character-some and complex beast of a beer. Lovely! (25cL, No date stamp, The Beer Store Morley)
Redoak Wee Heavy;Sydney, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"250ml bottle. I�m pretty sure I gave this to my old man as a birthday present around 3 years ago. Has remained untouched in his fridge since. Deep ruby body, fast dying tan foam. Rich intensity on the nose; smokey peat is very prominant, comines quite well with sweet mollasses and brown sugar malt notes. Raisin-like oxidised notes evident. Lengthy palate, texture is note as thick as I originally expected, some prickles of carbonation still present. Very sweet upfront; lots of mollasses, smokey malt and rich earthiness. Dries out quite a bit on the finish, lingering smokiness, hint of alcohol warmth and vinous fortified oxidised notes also. Age has probably thinned the body of this beer, but the flavours are certainly there. I can imagine this could age even longer without concern."
Redoak Wee Heavy;Sydney, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottle. Vinious and heavily malty on the nose. In the mouth it�s a little thinner than I would have liked with a strong malty flavour of bread, dark fruit and some yeasty elements. Decent.
Redoak Wee Heavy;Sydney, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Strawberries and Banana on the nose bit of smoke. Sweet complex taste. Kinda Tangy. Quite malty. Finishing with peaty smoke and alcohol warmth.
Redoak Wee Heavy;Sydney, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottle 250ml. Nice and tasty. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, and apple. Sweet flavour, with a touch of sourness. Medium body, silky mouthfeel. Brown and cloudy, white thin head.
Redoak Wee Heavy;Sydney, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Dark copper pour with a big creamy lasting head. Nose shows dark grapes, plums, chocolate, roasted grains, smoke, peanuts (???) and, unfortunately, some old cheese and Vegemite! Lots of sweet caramel upon tasting, along with some smoky, earthy peat and quite a strong tangy note, as found in green apples (acetaldehyde?). Carbonation is nice and creamy, but the body is on the watery side for such a malty beer.
Redoak Wee Heavy;Sydney, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;[Bottle] Pours hazy reddish-brown with a small beige head. Aroma is sweet, with caramel, raisin and toffee. Taste is even sweeter, with plum, raisin, mild peat, and some port character. Only mild bitterness is present. Decent mouthfeel with a good length finish where the peat is most evident. Strange wee heavy that isn�t nearly as strong with the peat as I would expect, and yet has huge amounts of raisin and dark fruit. Actually pretty drinkable though, and I did enjoy it, even if I wasn�t amazed.
Redoak Wee Heavy;Sydney, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottle. Dark red/brown with almost no head. This is the first beer I�ve tried from Redoak and after all I have heard about them, was a little underwhelmed. Aroma is pleasant, dark fruits, sweet malt, smoke and a touch of alcohol, but it is also very thin. Flavour has berries, port wine, grapes with a little bit of sourness. Fairly dry on the palate with a long finish. Overall, despite its faults, an interesting and drinkable beer.
Redoak Wee Heavy;Sydney, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Complex nose with hints of raisins, dark fruits, caramel and peat. Deep auburn color with a low head. Sweet almost sugary malt based with a prominent smoke taste. Almost a rauchbier, really. This took me by surprise at first, but it grew on my through the glass. I also think it got back as it got warmer.
Deep Creek Bear Claw ESB;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Deep Creek Brewing Company;Crystal clear, copper ale... like a shiny, new penny. Mid-sized, creamy, off-white head with ink-blot lacing. The nose and flavor deliver notes of toffee, butter and a hint of brown sugar. Well-hopped. Medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Short, crisp, clean finish. Very nice for the style.
Deep Creek Retro P Porter;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Porter;Deep Creek Brewing Company;Extremely dark, crystal clear, cola-colored ale with a tiny, creamy, well-tanned head. The aroma is very milk chocolatey, smokey and nutty, with notes of coffee and vanilla. The flavor pretty much matches the aroma. Medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and pillow-soft carbonation. Lengthy, mocha, burnt finish.
Goose Island Smoked Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter - Smoked;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"Cask conditioned at the brewpub, Wrigleyville location Black color; unfortunately served in a plastic cup because of the game. Mild aroma. Quite strong flavor of roasted malt and chocolate malt, smoked, even salami, and roasted nuts; but the body is too thin, not enough body, short final. I would not be surprised if they used liquid smoke. Overall not bad, drinkable, but the final is hard to stand (strangely bitter)."
Goose Island Smoked Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter - Smoked;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);i would have liked more campfire flavor and roasty goodness in this porter. it was a little thin for my taste.
Goose Island Smoked Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter - Smoked;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);A bit smokey and quite roasty. Still, has nothing on the Bamberg malts of Schlenkerla. But, even so, still a decent enough beer.
Goose Island Smoked Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter - Smoked;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Cask at Wrigleyville. Black with large creamy head. Noise is a lot of smoke, very meaty, some chocolate. Flavor is also meaty with burnt sugar. Medium body and pretty creamy. Very nice.
Goose Island Smoked Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter - Smoked;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On Tap @ GI- Dark brown, almost no head. Great cigar-esque nose. Smokey body with a bit of chocolate on the back, lively body lends to a good blend of smoke. Not too over the top in the smoke which is a plus in my book.
Goose Island Smoked Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter - Smoked;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at Clybourn in MBA glass: Deep brown with ruby highlights, small fading beige head and some lace. The aroma has notes of smoked wood, bacon, walnut, toffee, prune, and other earthy esters. The taste starts smoky as expected but not overpowering, nicely meaty. The sweeter malt and nutty character does show towards the finish. A bit chalky and dry, a tad too thin as well. A solid brew but could be so much more.
Goose Island Smoked Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter - Smoked;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);on tap at clybourn. pours dark with a red tint to it and no head. smells very smokey and meaty. tastes very meaty with some sweet caramel and roasted malts. more smoked than porter, something just isn�t working with this one.
Goose Island Smoked Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter - Smoked;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap @ Clybourn. Pours a dark brown black with a thin head that disapates to a few beige streaks. Roasted malts are of course the first notes, smokey bacon as Goose is so good at with charred edges. The nose isn�t hit me in the face strong as smokes can be but strong enough to detect. Flavors begin slightly sweet with coffee and bakers chocolate, rounding out with a little smoke and slightly dry. Thinner body and lighter flavors than I would have liked, but still good.
Goose Island Smoked Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter - Smoked;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);I�m not extensively familiar with smoked beer styles, but I�ve had a few, and I found this one to be a rather drinkable example for the style. For a style that is in my mind rather undrinkable, I would call this a good thing! It�s color is a nearly opaque black with a whisper of foam across the top. Aroma is similar to smoked sausage, and a bit intriguing. Flavor is more smokiness and summer-sausageness backed with some roastiness. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but I think this is probably the most drinkable rauchbier I�ve yet had.
Goose Island Smoked Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter - Smoked;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampled from tap at the Goose Island Beer Company (Clybourn) on 11/12/2006... Opaque, dark reddish brown color with a dense tan head. Roasted malt flavor and slightly fruity. Smooth finish. Very, very subtle smoke in the slightly dry finish. A bit thin on the palate. Not nearly enough smoke in this one and not nearly complex or deep enough...
West Virginia Olde Engine 86;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;West Virginia Brewing Company;Sparkling clear, textbook amber lager with a tiny, creamy, white head. The aroma is pretty much all hops... probably cascade. The nose is citrusy and piney. Perfectly-balanced and sufficiently bittered, otherwise, nondescript (much like most other beers of this style). Medium-bodied with an astringent mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Medium length, crisp, clean and then finally a lightly bitter finish.
Goose Island Doppelweiss;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Murky amber color with no head. Banana-ish aroma. Good malt, wheat, and fruit taste with a hit of banana as well. A bit of spice as well. Outstanding.
Goose Island Doppelweiss;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Opaque unfiltered apple cider color, tiny bubbles on top. Huge banana esthery nose. Medium bodied and quite tasty, loads of clove in the aftertaste, bubblegum, sticky bananas.

Goose Island Doppelweiss;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Cloudy mucky looking, brownish, little to no head. Big banana nose, some bubblegum. Medium sweetness, tons of banana flavor.
Goose Island Doppelweiss;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);This is some good stuff. Out of all the beers I sample at Goose Island this was the only one that was really worth a second glance. Hazy orange-amber. Very spicy and fruity with a hint of alcohol. Reminds me very much of Aventinus--high praise coming from me.
Goose Island Doppelweiss;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Hazy reddish copper with no head. The aroma shows strong banana and clove, with underlying notes of caramel, cinnamon, and perhaps a hint of light orange. The body is fairly full, considering this is an 8.0% wheat beer. The flavor is pretty good, though dominated by the banana and clove. Quite sweet, actually. Good, but the lack of carbonation and the immense sweetness detract from an otherwise quality beer.
Goose Island Doppelweiss;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"This was on the ""coming soon"" list on the chalkboard but one of the brewers came out with some for me and another customer, as he saw we were interested in the beer. He introduced himself and the beer, saying it was pretty much ready but wouldn�t be out for another week or two. He also described this as essentially a double-recipe version of their hefe. Reddish, peach-brown color with some cling to the head. This really intensifies the banana and bubblegum--the brewer said he prefers these flavors to the spicier side of hefeweizens--and definitely sweeter and tangier. Citrus-orange underneath. Not super-carbonated, but perhaps that was because of the origin of my sample, whereas once it is on the regular taps it will be? You can cut the flavors with a knife--just so thick. Excellent. (on tap at Clybourn location)"
Rock Bottom Chicago Sub Zero Barrel-Aged Barleywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rock Bottom Chicago;Draught. Recovered notes while cleaning out some drawers! Don�t really even need notes though, as I have a vivid memory of the beer. Such a bad ass brew. Brown color. Complex nose, very vibrant, with notes of the original beer and the barrel in an integrated way. Flavor is bold, very sweet, massively flavorful and complex. Notes of toffee, caramel, bourbon, toast, chocolate, vanilla and wood. Classic offering from a great brewery and one of the pioneers of barrel aging.
Rock Bottom Chicago Sub Zero Barrel-Aged Barleywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rock Bottom Chicago;Sweet and thick, a barley wine to savor. Perhaps too much Bourbon in the aroma, a strange statement from an old juice hound, I know. Toffee and caramel in the taste, sweet (I think I said that before), with a mild woodiness and much Bourbon and alcohol. A tastey treat. More! Vintage Beer Fest at Delilah�s, Chicago, IL 02/25/2006
Rock Bottom Chicago Sub Zero Barrel-Aged Barleywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Sampled at Delilah�s Vintage Ale Fest. Pours a dark cloudy brown. Vanilla and caramel in the nose along with a slightly tart note.

Rock Bottom Chicago Sub Zero Barrel-Aged Barleywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rock Bottom Chicago;Thick oily texture. Bourbony alcohol dominates the nose.

Rock Bottom Chicago Sub Zero Barrel-Aged Barleywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rock Bottom Chicago;FoBAB: hazy medium brown with no head. Huge sweet malt aroma, caramel, toffee, chocolate and light bourbon.

Rock Bottom Chicago Sub Zero Barrel-Aged Barleywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at the brewpub 12/16/2005: Pours a dark mahogany with a thin off-white head. Rich, sweet caramel and bourbon aroma has lots of raisin and fig flavor. Very rich, sweet dark caramel body reveals more bourbon toward the sticky finish. Has a ton of complexity and decent bittering hoppy presence, but is too cloying to drink more than a few ounces.

Rock Bottom Chicago Sub Zero Barrel-Aged Barleywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at the Chicago brewpub. Pours a very dark brown--maybe slightly cloudy but hard to tell w/ as dark as it is. No head but that�s not a serious negative in such a high gravity beer. Big nose--a lot of vanilla up front w/ big malts, molasses and maple syrup. Barrel aged character is a definite centerpiece here w/ a subtle but not all overwhelming American oak flavor. Mouthfeel is big and full, slightly syrupy but not sticky and just a little bit salty. A bit of bitterness finishes it out but, again, nothing approaching overwhelming. This is a giant beer but the good folks at Rock Bottom put forth a hell of a show in making no one flavor stick out and keeping it complex in subtle.

Castel Zolotoe Pivo;Tbilisi, Georgia;Pilsener - Imperial;Castel-Sakartvelo (BGI);"Clear yellow gold; yellow head with diffuse bubbles, not stable. Malty, grainy and aroma of garden herbs as chervil, parsley - or carrot�s green. Roasted/toasted taste and I�m again getting parsley, more outspoken now. Another grain but barley, hesitating to name any - buckwheat, maybe? As with another Georgian tasted beer, delayed hopbitterness. Rather fuller bodied, but empty moutfheel, very moderate alcoholburn. Sharper, metallic finish, dry. Not terrible, less harsh than some Eastern strong lagers. I wonder about this greenery flavour - some cheap local amylum source?"

City Steam Amarillo By Morning;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;IPA;City Steam Brewery;Piney, prickly Amarillo hops hover in supremacy over peaches and oranges...Very light body could be passed for hop-perfumed water and obviously eases the experience for those who are afraid of boldness...Probably an efficient pint to quench the thirst, but nothing more...
City Steam Amarillo By Morning;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;IPA;City Steam Brewery;Palest clean yellow. Explosive lemon zest aroma. Interesting hops those amarillos, I don�t think I�ve had a beer with those too often. They come out very spicy, minty, grassy. The beer itself is rather quaffable, but a little smooth ultimately for an IPA. Light body once again I guess a bit more malt would help to enhance its raw hedonistic value. There�s still a faint cookie-ish touch though. Gentle and approachable, quaffable even. Nice medium bitterness seems to lace around the mouth. Definitely not very complex if not uninteresting.
City Steam Amarillo By Morning;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;IPA;City Steam Brewery;Very sweet citrus orange aroma with some floral hints. Smells yummy. TRANSPARENT blonde/straw color reminiscent of BMC. Small white head. Should be darker in color. Citrus orange hoppiness hits you immediately. Buttery sweet, and sticky in the middle.

Arbor Brasserie Greff Kriek;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Hazed, ruby-red grapefruit color with tiny bubbles working it out on top. Aroma captivates. Raspberry kernels and tart cherry fruit excretions join with cheese danishes and perfumey mulberry. Sour flavor excretes a cottony, tart cherry motif with a touch of vanilla and almond base traits. The perfume plays out with mulberry and lavender, and rose blossoms drop a few flavor petals as well. A hint of soupy cleanliness gets lined with lilac pollinations. Raspberry kernels arise with a touch of anisette. Sourdough gets smeared with strawberry casings and rye chips. Lime juice hangs on the lips when appropriately licked, and the tart cherry matter hangs onto the end.

Arbor Brasserie Greff Kriek;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Bottle ala SoG. 8/05. A couple different looks to this one. One of the first pours was a slightly hazed pink amber, while a later pour (mine) was a heavily clouded light rust colored liquid. Pinkish off-white diminishing head. Tart nose with cherries and hints of herbal hops. Mild lemon and spices in the background. Tart cherries mixed with apple jacks cereal. A rather interesting combination. Mild attic dust and acid mix in the middle. Rather light and dry in the finish with strawberries and cloves. From looking at other reviews this looks to be a brew that is better fresher.
Arbor Brasserie Greff Kriek;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Bottle via Joel. Vintage 08/2005? The beer pours to a watery tomato juice like body with a white head. The aroma is cherries, funky barnyard. Nice balance of tartness to fruitiness. The flavor has tart cherries, light strawberries, nice balance of tartness and fruit. Quite nice. The palate is tart with a nice mouthfeel.
Arbor Brasserie Greff Kriek;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Curious and sweet aroma is overwhelmed by tomatoes with some underlying notes of flowers, cherries, ginger, cinammon and pepper. Opaque amber-brown body is topped by a low white head that recedes to ring. Full-on cinammon candy flavour is lightly peppery. Very mild acidity. Medium body is very dry with initially strong carbonation that does not last leaving a watery texture. Bottle (Bottled May 2004) sampled with MartinT, Olivier_MTL and Rastacouere.
Arbor Brasserie Greff Kriek;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Explosive bottle presents a very cloudy ruby-pink beer with an initially very large head consisting of big collapsing bubbles, ultimately receding to a well proportioned cover without lacing. Musty mushroom, tomatoes and old cellar nose that doesn�t spell glory through its rather chaotic organization. Enormous cinnamon is in great part responsible for this wreck as it joins the cherry aspects to give it a candy feel despite the beer being generally dry. Full of contradictions, unfortunately, but it might be getting old, having been bought a year ago at the brewery.

Ringneck Rooster Red;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Brew Kettle;"22 oz bomber: Orangey amber w/a short lived light beige head. Pretty well balanced w/ a benign light caramel & toasted malt aromas. Fruity & floral hop notes. Fruitiness seems like D�Anjou pears. A light grapefruit citrus hop chimes in as it warms. Flavor is again well balanced; caramel is present and moderate w/ a light herbal hop flavor. Finish seems lightly herbal hop flavored and lingers into the aftertaste. Clean caramel malt aftertaste as well but not as pronounced as the hops. Higher carbonation, but not Belgian type, lighter body and a dry m/f. This beer is between the Copperhead Red and their amber ale. Seems to lack a little identity. More caramel than the amber, but less roast than the Copperhead. Very good job by Chris if that�s what he was shooting for, but seems like a waste of resources. I still prefer the Copperhead Red!!!!"

BJ's Imperor Imperial IPA;Huntington Beach, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;had a sample of this as my first beer at last weekends barleys beer festival....im not a huge fan of bjs beers although they are palatable. this one was probably the best beer i have to date of theirs. however still this cloying aftertaste of astringent cleaners or extracts. huge hope character dominating here with a slight malty bed to lie on, a bit sweet in the palate as well. not much co2. i definately didnt feel like it was way too hoppy for me as the other rates state. lets get real this cant hold a candle to the likes of a stone ipa, bear republic , etc. but still good.
BJ's Imperor Imperial IPA;Huntington Beach, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;The beer I had was brewed in Chandler, Arizona. This was the biggest double IPA I have ever had. It had something like 150 IBU�s of hop bitterness in it. Not at all balanced because of the hop overload and not a beer you could drink everyday but an outstanding job aty creating what I think has to be the worlds hoppiest beer.
BJ's Imperor Imperial IPA;Huntington Beach, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;"Well, I thought I�d never say this but I�ve found a beer that is �almost� to �hopped up� for me, it�s a taste bud numbing 147 IBU�s and 8 percent ABV, had it on tap at Papago Brewing this weekend. The beer fresh from the top sets in the glass a nebulous amber to burnished copper color with a statuesque creamy light tan head that after its erosion leaves a thick and sticky coat of lace that welds itself to the glass. Nose is unbelievably light in floral aromas, sweet malt, and citrus crisp and fresh, a real treat for both the olfactory and ocular senses, start is sweet and delightfully, malted, the top is moderate in feel to the palate. Finish is delectable in its acidity, then �BLAM, ZAP, POW, ZOWIE geez Batman, the hops slap your taste buds to life, then strangle them numb, and then leaves you wondering if you will ever taste anything again. Had a De Dolle Stille Nacht and a Imperial Octoberfest after this, didn�t taste a thing, so what�s a poor guy to do, �Hell Yeah"", I had a couple more �Imperor�s�. Damn what a hoot, but trust me most every other normal person in the pub was doing a third Imperor with a topping of two thirds Sonora Burning bird, �Tee Hee� wimps! Lol"

Golden in colour but lacks the vibrant, aromatic hop character that I look for in a Summer beer. Seeing that it only uses Goldings, that comes as no surprise.

The Brew Kettle India Pale Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Kettle;This is a good looking ale, a bright copper body with a tall & rocky pale khaki head that laces in chunks. There�s a sweetness in the aroma that�s nearly buried by scents of pine, grapefruit, and tart tangerine. A thick, sweet caramel is balanced by bitter flavors of pine, grapefruit and the finish maintains that balance. Had it been a tad more bitter I�d have rated it higher. Still, a quaffable IPA. From my esteemed The LoSBD colleague frankenkitty.
The Brew Kettle India Pale Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Kettle;An eager pour produced a three-finger, ecru head that fell slowly and laced in a frothy spackle above a copper-penny body.

The Brew Kettle India Pale Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Kettle;Bottle: Dark mahogany pour. Aroma shows some toasted malt, carmel, slight pine and resin. Light carbonation. Woody, malty, slightly sweet flavors are there, but this is really muddy and cluttered on the palate. Though there is a bitter touch to the finish, this really was missing the crispness and big hops I look for in an IPA.
The Brew Kettle India Pale Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Kettle;Bottle: Lasting off white head w/ a medium amber body.

Moderate fruitiness. Aftertaste is pleasantly bitter and hop flavored. Dry m/f w/ low carbonation. Very nicely done IPA. Bitter as it should be, alcohol is either well hidden if it is up to par for an IPA, but seems low to me. Nice session beer. Lots of flavor, easy drinking.
The Brew Kettle India Pale Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Kettle;I bought this bottle at the brewery on 8/27/04.

Great Dane Blond Doppelweizen;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. They told me it was 8.2% ABV. Pours a cloudy orange golden with a short-lived 1/2 finger off-white head. Aroma of clove and banana, caramel and light toasted malt. After warming I got a bit of vanilla. Flavor was much the same with some lemon tang up front--a nice sweet tangy battle going on. Light sharp carbonation with a medium body. Pretty good.
Great Dane Blond Doppelweizen;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap. Pours a deep, dark, intensely hazy, nearly opaque amber with white fluffy head. Aroma is of tart citrus and sourdough bread. Flavor is sharp & tart at first, then there�s a huge kick of intense malt sweetness. Bready, malty and earthy with a small contribution from earthy, lightly spicy hops. Big thick sweet sticky palate. This stuff rocks.
Great Dane Blond Doppelweizen;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Fruity banana aroma with a nice spicy wheat twist. Cloudy amber with a thin, white head that diminishes. Funky, spicy clove and banana flavor with a toasted caramel malt finish. Very flavorful. Medium body, creamy palate. Like the others have said, like a stronger crop circle wheat but with a slight dunkel flavor.
Great Dane Blond Doppelweizen;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Cloudy Gold Coloring. Small White Head. Citrus and Wheat Aroma..Mostly Wheat. Little Citrus on the Tongue...Mostly Wheat and Malt. Balanced and Quite Good! Good Year for Summer Brew!
Great Dane Blond Doppelweizen;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Hazy yellow color with a thin head. Wheat aroma. Good flavor of bananas, wheat, and malt. Fairly sweet overall. Tasty, very tasty!
Great Dane Blond Doppelweizen;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Rerate for 2006 - same color/head but aroma of clove and a strong butterscotch and bubblegum aroma that was offputting for me. Sour. Worse than �04 version. That was 2005 - 2006 is much improved with sharp, but well crafted honey/clover/banana..good job! Cloudy mango pr peach juice color with a citrusy nose and slight acidic aroma. Nice thin white head. Hot alcohol up front, followed by lemon, vanilla, banana and cinnnamon. Not really fruity though despite the description. The dryness makes it refreshing for a big beer. Agree with tomxcs that it is like a Crop Circle squared, because it is light in body, but still large in flavor.
Great Dane Blond Doppelweizen;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Cloudy straw color with a smaller white head. Aromas of sweet wheat, light bananas and a touch of alcohol. Mild malt and banana flavors with a touch of spice in the backdrop. For the ABV this is a dangerous wheat. Quite drinkable.
Great Dane Blond Doppelweizen;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;This is basically Great Dane Crop Circle Wheat x 2. Thankfully the bartender didn�t put a lemon in it as they always do with the Crop Circle Wheat! They wouldn�t serve me a pint, just a 10oz. or so glass. It was okay. Very, very cloudy, somewhat citrusy, and refreshing. Light feeling but packing a punch. The flavors and aroma seemed rather subdued and could have been stronger.

Clocktower IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IPA;Clocktower Brewpub;Had a pint on tap as well as from cask. Pint arrived with a small size light hazelnut colour head and sticks around for a bit. Has an amber colour appearance. Thick lacing. Aromas are quite faint in my opinion. Some citrus notes with lighter type malts. Flavours are quite hoppy, floral hops along with light roasted malts. Hints of cinnamon. Sweeter than usual IPA�s, with the toasted caramel being added to the mix. Has a creamy full bodied mouthfeel and has medium carbonation. Enjoyed immensely! Also on cask, this one has much more malty flavours and more of a wet mouthfeel. Nutty flavours. Unfiltered. Appearance a bit darker than their normal IPA. Still pretty good, and slightly different.

Clocktower IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IPA;Clocktower Brewpub;Tried this beer on tap and on cask tonight at the Glebe brewpub (now at 5.8% ABV). Pours a dark amber colour with a creamy light beige head that has great retention and thick patchy lace. Smells like their typical grain malt, but with some caramel and mild hops. Slightly creamy mouthfeel because of the everlasting head. Nice dryness in the finish, but not too crazy. Perfumy malt taste with sweet caramel and the grapefruit hop kicking in the finish. Decent bitterness with an above average strength. Notes of nuts. Seems like more roasted malts than most IPA, but ends up balancing the hop very well. CASK: Unfiltered, smaller foamy head, wet mouthfeel. Fruity malt at first. Bitterness takes a long time to kick in. Nuttier finish. More flavours. More aromas of dark fruits, nut, coffee and roasted malt. Less bitterness. Interesting to try both, side-by-side.
Clocktower IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IPA;Clocktower Brewpub;"Pint at the Bank St location. Deep clear copper with a smallish greenish-light tan head.

Clocktower IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IPA;Clocktower Brewpub;Pours a dark amber brown with a small off white top. Aroma is faint pine hops and toffee. Taste is more bitterness than a malt profile and hop flavouring. I think they got the bittering hops right but forgot about the flavouring.
Clocktower IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IPA;Clocktower Brewpub;The IPA is back after 4 years! A reddish maber IPA with a thin off white head. In aroma, pleasant fragrant c-hops, with citrusy notes, quite nice. In mouth, a classy IPA with biscuitty malts, cascade hops, very smooth and subdued, some sweetness in finale, a bit lighter bodied but good. On tap at brewpub, Feb. 1 2011.

Bent River Bavarian Pilsner;Moline, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bent River Brewing Company;From the tap, served in a standard bar pint glass. Made a decent appearance, poured a clear pilsener golden yellow with a small foamy white head that settled into a thin lacing, moderate carbonation overall. Had a clean nose, sweet pale malts and a faint grassy hoppiness. A crisp smooth light bodied mouth feel, good drinkability. Dry crackerish taste at first, a lightly sweet fruity maltiness follows, soft grassy hoppiness towards the end and a dry, crisp pale malty finish. I love pilseners, German, Czech and a few American brewed pilseners, and this met all my needs, dry, tasty and quite quaffable, one of the better offerings, in my personal opinion, at the Bent River.
Bent River Bavarian Pilsner;Moline, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bent River Brewing Company;Light hazy yellow with a thin top. Big bitter aspect but with a funky/skunky cereal malt undertone.

Bent River Bavarian Pilsner;Moline, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bent River Brewing Company;"On tap at the brewpub. Well-balanced archetype of a pilsner. Aroma of freshly mowed hay. Crisp with no aftertaste or lingering bitterness. It�s really exciting to find a brewer that mastered the high gravity stuff, and then went on to make such an outstanding lighter beer such as this. Larry commented that this beer ""Does so many things to my tongue that it makes me want to go out and find somebody to fall in love with."""
Bent River Jerrys Honey Bear Porter;Moline, Illinois, United States;Porter;Bent River Brewing Company;Had on tap at the brewpub in a pint glass along with a buddy of mine. Slight honey on the nose but not too apparent in the flavor - must have been more for fermentables. Nice roasted notes with hints of coffee and chocolate.
Bent River Jerrys Honey Bear Porter;Moline, Illinois, United States;Porter;Bent River Brewing Company;On tap at Bent River brewpub. Mega dark brown with a thin fading tan head. Aroma of roasted/dark malts, chocolate and honey. Taste of roasted and dark malts, honey and mild chocolate. Ok.
Bent River Jerrys Honey Bear Porter;Moline, Illinois, United States;Porter;Bent River Brewing Company;Shared a growler of this a while back. Pours dark reddish brown and appears black in glass. Aroma is burnt malt and chocolate. Flavor is malt, sweet chocolate and some dark fruits. A little dry but not to bad.
Bent River Jerrys Honey Bear Porter;Moline, Illinois, United States;Porter;Bent River Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery in Moline. This is an excellent porter that pours dark brown/black. A thin head on top dissipates quickly and settles in to decent lacing. The aroma is of chocolate, coffee, and a hint of honey. The flavor falls somewhere between sweet and dry and the flavor comes primarily from the caramel and chocolate tones from the crystal and chocolate malts. The honey adds to the dryness on the back on end of the tastes and a very small amount of residual sweetness. A very tasty porter indeed.
Bent River Jerrys Honey Bear Porter;Moline, Illinois, United States;Porter;Bent River Brewing Company;The head on this mahogany ale disappeared quickly and left a ring to remember it by. The aroma is a lightly roasted malt with dark caramel and bittersweet chocolate. All are present in the flavor. Unfortunately, a light sourness comes out in the finish, marring what is otherwise a fine Porter. Bent River Brewing Company, Moline, IL
Bent River Jerrys Honey Bear Porter;Moline, Illinois, United States;Porter;Bent River Brewing Company;Draght at the brewpub. Deep dark brown color with some red around the edges. Head was thick, tan, and of moderate longevity. There was only a tiny bit of lace on the glass at the end. Smelled of light chocolate, almost like a tootsie roll. Flavor was also chocolatey with a touch of roasted malt. Dry as a bone on the tongue.
Bent River Jerrys Honey Bear Porter;Moline, Illinois, United States;Porter;Bent River Brewing Company;From a growler provided by good beer buddy Rob (RooftopRogue). Beneath a fast disappearing tan head lay a deep dark brown brew. Coffee hits the nose at first. Smoke lurks in the background but it�s subtle. A rich toasted maltiness is evident with a modicum of honey capping it all off. The rap on this is thinness. A more full and robust mouthfeel would add volumes to this otherwise tasty treat.
Bent River Jerrys Honey Bear Porter;Moline, Illinois, United States;Porter;Bent River Brewing Company;Bottle from a growler, thank you kindly Duane. Great Guy. This poured ddep brown with red hig lights. Nose was all coffee? Taste was sweet. Mouth feel was light though. This was good, to bad I didn�t get to taste last years.
Bent River Jerrys Honey Bear Porter;Moline, Illinois, United States;Porter;Bent River Brewing Company;bottle courtesy of duane from a growler, aroma is strong of coffee,with toast and hops and an underlying honey scent. the pour was a deep mahogany color. it appeared solid in the middle, but the edges had a reddish opacity. pretty sweet flavor, the honey is an underlying taste with a huge toasted malt profile and a bit of coffee, but not nearly as much as i expected from the aroma. the body is pretty thin, and a little bit on the bitter side in the aftertaste until the honey sweetness that sticks to your lips comes through. a nice porter, but based on what Duane said about it, i wish i could have had it last year.
Bent River Jerrys Honey Bear Porter;Moline, Illinois, United States;Porter;Bent River Brewing Company;12oz bottle hand bottled from a growler and sent to me in a trade by Duane! Thanks!! Pours black with a short tan head that faded pretty quickly to a film. Aroma is malty, some smoke, very earthy. Flavor is some smokey roasty notes. I can taste the honey in it behind the smokiness and coffee flavor. Not real robust as the flavor seems a little subdued. This is very thin and watery on the palate. Drinkable, malty and sweet though.
Bent River Imperial Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bent River Brewing Company;Had this on tap at the brewpub awhile back. A nice entry from BR with a typical but nice profile.
Bent River Imperial Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bent River Brewing Company;draft at brewpub.......aroma: nothing too unique on this front. assertive chocolate malt flavor.....appearance: medium bodied, dark brownish black pour w/ medium sized tan head....taste: sweet with little to no bitterness. consisted primarily of chocolate and toasty malts. medium body and mouthfeel.....very passable and enjoyable IS but lacked the extra oomph.
Bent River Imperial Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bent River Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a deep, dark brown color with red-orange highlights. Head was thick, tan and left some lace behind. Aroma was of rich milk chocolate and molasses. Full bodied and candy sweet with a distinct malty milk chocolatey flavor. Not bad.
Bent River Imperial Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bent River Brewing Company;Draft: Dark ruby. Dense head with off-white swirls. Subdued nose of molasses-glazed pecans, black cherries, nougat, and deeply buried roasted malt. Lightly bodied but softly fluffy in texture. Opens with a grainy mixture of cane sugar and roasted grains. Intriguing medley of ever changing flavors ranging from rich molasses-dipped roasted hazelnuts and caramelized custard, with trailing flashes of woody roast dryness and creamed java with a light dusting of cinnamon. Brilliantly understated roastiness gains more softness by a dash of vanilla, which compounds the overall relaxed nature of the brew. Becomes dryly chocolaty and sweetly sappy toward the center, which pillars the thinnish body as the dryness perfectly tempers the sweetness Finishes with hints of caramelized custard over a seamlessly blended display of refined roast and lightly scorched toffee. Another deliciously mellow session Imperial.
Bent River Imperial Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bent River Brewing Company;Tankx to me man duane, bottle from a growler. Thsi was tastey. Poured a dark clear brown/black. Not much head, but with all the poured and transport, no points of. Aroma was roasted malts and some choclate, and the taste was good too. Lots of chocolate up front, followed with coffee and some creaminess as well. Smooth with no bitterness and I slight bite alcohol. Duane, you are a true ratebeerian, my first tarde , and a good man. Thanks again.
Bent River Imperial Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bent River Brewing Company;thx to duane for a bottled from growler bottle. dark brown pour, but still very translucent, thin layer of foamy white head. aroma of chocolate, and some coffee and licorice tones as well. a nice flavor, an almost bourbon taste leads the way to a very sweet, chocolate tail. barely any bitterness at all, and a nice warm mouthfeel. the body is pretty thin, you could even see as you poured it. not quite up to par with the upper reaches of the I.S. family, but overall, a nice easy to drink stout beer.
Bent River Imperial Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bent River Brewing Company;on tap at the brewpub and brought home a growler. a solid stout by the folks at Bent River. roasted malt with chocolate and some coffee undertones. I was told this batch was aged longer and has a bit more ABV than the original Impy. Stout. This is an excellent stout, but with just a medium body it�s not quite the Imperial Stout many of us have become accustomed to drinking of late.
Bent River Imperial Stout;Moline, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bent River Brewing Company;"On tap at the brewpub. Now that�s a stout. Unfortunately, it�s just not up to par for an outstanding Imperial stout. The bartender, Neil, says that it is still young. It did not have as much body as I would have expected, but it did have the requisite ""almost barleywine"" sweetness. At 7.5-8% abv, this is easy on the palate. Head retention better than the oatmeal stout. Sort of like drinking Vicks Formula 44-D: it's good medicine, you know it's good for you. Go ahead, take your medicine."
McMenamins Umpteen IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Amber with a foamy head and nice lacing. Nice fresh hop aromas. Lots of lemons and oranges with bitter hops.

McMenamins Umpteen IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Sampled draught at McMenamins High St, EugeneColor in between orange and yellow, light head, sticky lacing. Nose of floral hops, not too fresh or exciting, just there. The flavor is fairly watery all considering and finishes bitter from the hops. Light in body and mouthfeel and overall life. Typical McMenamins IPA.
McMenamins Umpteen IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Pours a darker amber color with a small off-white head. Decent citrus hop aroma, not overly powerful.

Swaf Blonde (formerly Vervifontaine);Aubel, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie de l'Abbaye du Val-Dieu;"The blond one in this series of commissioned beers with coarse but very thick, creamy head and peach blonde colour with light orangey glow, clear but cloudy with deposit. Fresh fruity aroma of apple, green plums, pineapple, ginseng again, coriander, grassy hops, dough, orange peel, dried leaves. Soft, restrained fruity palate, very light �citrusness�, mellow maltiness, bready, medium carbo, yeasty, dryish with subtle and mild bitterness spiciness; I have yet to taste the brown version, but in any case this one hides its ginseng a lot better than the Ambr�e, but just because of this, it is a lot more trivial."

Swaf Blonde (formerly Vervifontaine);Aubel, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie de l'Abbaye du Val-Dieu;11.12oz bottle from Tiggmtl, drunk on 11/3/07. BB July 2007 With a pop of the cap, I get an immediate rush of a very pleasan mixture of soft, floral, heathery hops and light honey-vanilla pale malt notes. Wow, we may actually have something here....(unlike the brune and ambree, which were very disappointing). I pour a glass and leave it alone for a few minutes to breath. Sediment left behind in the bottle, and a mostly clear peach-golden body with a large, but mostly dissipating head. Light lacing. When I come back, to my displeasure, there is no sign of either the hops or malts. Instead, I�m greeted with rather dull yeast notes, plentiful (overbearing) esters and almost a pineapple-like sweetness. Very odd, especially given how it started out. Some yeast blandness and dry, bread-like graininess takes some of the sweetness down a notch, but there�s nothing here that is elegant or particularly enjoyable. Don�t know if there�s some DMS in the nose, or if that�s just a mix of the esters, ginseng and sweetness....no alcohol noted in the aroma, medium strength overall. Very basic honey sweetness in the flavor, with medium amounts of carbonation that allow some looseness in to the texture. Sweetness ranges between sticky sponge cake and overly sweet vanilla cake, with plentiful apricot/peach/pineapple notes and moderately strong phenolic spiciness on the end (white pepper, light medicinal notes). Attenuation is off (too sweet), texture is too sticky, while the carbonation too loose. Alcohol is concealed, and there seem to be few flaws. Eh....
Swaf Blonde (formerly Vervifontaine);Aubel, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie de l'Abbaye du Val-Dieu;Hazy golden colored brew. With ginseng, this is not notable in the flavor or the aroma. Sweet and fruity aroma, a bit spicy. Just an avarage blonde flavor with added fruits.

Old stale fruits pair with the musty spiced french toast in this repetitive dull yeast display. Odd vegetal notes don�t contribute to any enlightenment. Minimal citrusy hops. Just feels undevelopped, that yeast strain contributes nothing despite the authentic belgian texture.

Valjevsko Pivo;Valjevo, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Valjevska Pivara;Thank you to Alen for this thoughtful gift. Pours golden, a little thin, with a short white head that fades quickly. The aroma is unusual. Its quite grainy, but this is overshadowed by heavy butterscotch and minor honey. Moderate bitterness. No flavor in particular jumps out at you when sipping. Instead there is a balance of grain, floral hops, honey, cereal, and corn. This is pretty much lacking a finish. Light in body and kind of rough in texture. I've drank worse.
Valjevsko Pivo;Valjevo, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Valjevska Pivara;Bottle from Tres Bonne Cuisine. Pale yellow, clear, lazy carbonation, small foamy head. Light, sweet grain aroma, hint of cheese. Taste is also grainy and malty, a bit of skunk, but not nasty. Actually kind of pleasant , surprising for an East European lager.

Valjevsko Pivo;Valjevo, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Valjevska Pivara;"500 ml bottle from Valli Produce in Rockford, IL, as Spirit Tesla. Couldn�t resist as it was under $2 (on special!) and I was pretty sure I�d never had a beer from Serbia. And I haven�t, until now! Let�s see how tasty this is...poured into a Guinness glass just a couple of minutes out of the fridge, this is very pale, bubbly blonde-gold, with a thick and reasonably stable snow-white head that laces thickly as it recedes...the aroma is, alas, pure skunk initially; a few minutes out of the bottle, it becomes *slightly* less noxious and there�s a faint whiff of pale malts and sweetness, but it never really becomes palatable...and speaking of palates, on the tongue it�s not nearly so bad, mostly corn-sweet and bland with perhaps a mild detergent character and a hint of finishing bitterness...sticky yet watery mouthfeel, too-low carbonation. I�d rather have a Blatz, Ratebeer."

Otto's Pilsener Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Draft at Otto�s. Pours golden with a white head. Leaves trace lacing in the glass. Solid grass notes on the nose and tongue. Finished clean.
Otto's Pilsener Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Draft at brewery. Clear gold. Dull, surprisingly low hop character despite the description in menu. I got moderate-mild bitterness and a generic mild noble character. Malts present but well attenuated. Comes off a bit like stale bread and underwhelming noble hops. Nothing wrong with it but I'd like a lot more.
Otto's Pilsener Lager;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otto's Pub and Brewery;"Transfer from BA review from 6-12-12- Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance � Served a golden color with a light one finger head that dissipated quite fast to leave little to no lacing. Smell � The smell is quite light but is mainly of a bready and spicy saaz aroma with the lightest bit of lemon smell. Taste � The taste begins with a biscuit malt and bready flavor. These create a base and are present throughout the taste. In the middle a very light sweetness comes to the tongue; mainly of a light honey like flavor. This sweet flavor is accompanied by a spicy hoppy flavor with some herbal characteristics. The sweet flavors in the end are lost however with the intensifying of the spicy hop flavors along with some more light bitter flavors of a lemon nature come to the taste and lingered on the tongue long after the beer is gone from the mouth. Mouthfeel � The body is on the medium to thin side with the carbonation level average. The body and the carbonation suit the beer well complementing the lighter flavors and bitterness of the end of the taste making this beer very drinkable and session like. Overall � An easy drinking brew but in most ways a standard lager. It does however have a nice bitter and hop flavor at the end which was quite nice and gave a nice dimension not present in the standard lager."

Gubernija Ledukas;�iauliai, Lithuania;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Gubernija;500ml tin can bought in Walthamstow, in a random shop on the High Street: must take my glasses next time I buy unknown beers, 2.5% ABV isn�t my thing! The can was broached at home with the wife on 15 Mar 2013: poured into two Veltins stemmed tulips. Very pale golden urine colour with a good white head which soon did a runner: the body had a slight hazy, cloudy hue to it. Mini grain smell at first then sulphurus and slightly metallic. Fairly sweet taste: a lager tops rather than a lager shandy, but along those lines. Drank swiftly after a hot day on the beach, this would have been fine: however drank slowly as a first review of a Friday session it wasn�t fine. Weak (obviously at 2.5% ABV) and almost refreshing: otherwise tasteless.
Gubernija Ledukas;�iauliai, Lithuania;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Gubernija;Pours a pale golden colour, weak head. Sweet aroma and taste. Light bitter. Bad.

Gubernija Ledukas;�iauliai, Lithuania;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Gubernija;Can. Golden colour, medium short lasting white head. Bit citrus and grainy mild breadish aroma. Thin mouthfeel. Mild bitterness in flavour with something mild breadish, grains and light citrus. Poor.
Gubernija Ledukas;�iauliai, Lithuania;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Gubernija;Pale yellow of color with a white head. An odd aroma of puke and smoke from fireworks. A flavor of water with bread - pretty odd in taste.

Denmark Dubbel;Denmark, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Denmark Brewing;Sampled at the Milwaukee YEHa!05 courtesy of JPDIPSO: Pours a clear copper bronze with a thin ring of white head. Nice, authentic Belgian yeasty aroma has some sweet bready malt and a touch of peppery spice. Starts with a dry grainy crystal maltiness tending toward an earthy, lightly sticky finish. Needs more sweet, biscuity Belgian malt.
Denmark Dubbel;Denmark, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Denmark Brewing;Sadly, Wisconsin beer #300. Clear, opulent medium-orange color with a dusty attic head. Fiercely catastrophic aroma made up of coriander and shavings off an Irish Spring soap bar. Pepper and paprika? Shit. Flagrant, harsh hitting force pummels the palate. Clover floral dance and vanilla cotton blossoms. Effervescence (initially) gives way to a cover story for the alcohol presence. Scratchy chords and ceaseless secondary droning by imitation vanilla extract. What on earth were they thinking? Thanks for bringing the bottle, JPDIPSO.

Denmark Dubbel;Denmark, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Denmark Brewing;Thanks to John. Pours to a golden bronze color with no head. The aroma is estery and sweet toasted caramel. The flavor is woody pale malts and sweet toasted caramel.
Denmark Dubbel;Denmark, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Denmark Brewing;Bottle. Dark golden to bronze color with a small lid of off white bubbles. Sugar coated roses, mild pale malt and barnyard aromas. resins and esters also abound. Smooth sweet start. Very floral flavors mix with Special B and a dry candi flavor. Light spice and dry malts mix later in the quaff. Some tree bark and wood seem to dry out the flavors the farther you get into this one. Not a bad effort, just not balanced. This reminds me of some of the funky brews out of the Netherlands for some reason.
Denmark Dubbel;Denmark, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Denmark Brewing;Festival tap: Cloudy dark yellow with massive sugar nose, alcohol still peeks through. Some funky yeast flavors and pale malts. Dry from alcohol at finish. Estery banana notes in the aftertaste.
Randys Fun Hunters Warhawk Wheat;Whitewater, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Randys Restaurant & Fun Hunters Brewery;Slightly watery. Typical mishmash of witbier and pale ale. Very bland and watery.
Randys Fun Hunters Warhawk Wheat;Whitewater, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Randys Restaurant & Fun Hunters Brewery;"Looks like a ""lite"" beer but has a subtle hint of wheat on the nose. Flavor is blah not good but not bad. Not something I would really want again."
Randys Fun Hunters Warhawk Wheat;Whitewater, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Randys Restaurant & Fun Hunters Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, pours a pale yellow with a decent white head, aroma is of slight lemon with grass and grain, the flavor is actualy kind of sour and off putting, kind of tastes like lemon cleaner in the finish, (not that I�ve tried that before, just assuming) Not for me.
Randys Fun Hunters Warhawk Wheat;Whitewater, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Randys Restaurant & Fun Hunters Brewery;I got a sampler flight of 5 beers today, and I started here. It was a good wheat, not too strong, it treated me right.

Pours a clear light blonde brew with a thin creamy white head that slowly dissolves to a white ring with some spotty lacing. Aroma of multi-grain malt, some corn grits, yeast with a touch of citrus zest (even without the lemon slice that usually comes with the beverage). Taste is light bodied, lightly carbonated with a white bready and light citrus flavor. Finish is slightly citrusy, dry texture and a white bread aftertaste.

Poured a light to medium and slightly hazy yellow color with a small sized white head. Nice wheaty aromas with citrus. Tastes of wheat and citrus. Lightly tart finish. I liked the wheatiness of this one and found it refreshing.
Randys Fun Hunters Warhawk Wheat;Whitewater, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Randys Restaurant & Fun Hunters Brewery;Pours to a hazy light pale caramel colored body. The aroma is a light wheat. Pretty basic. The flavor is a clean and fresh wheat. Basic but very drinkable. Light graham cracker. Medium body with a lightly chewy palate. A well done but too plain wheat.
Randys Fun Hunters Warhawk Wheat;Whitewater, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Randys Restaurant & Fun Hunters Brewery;From the tap at Randy�s. Served with a lemon slice. Exactly what you would expect out of wheat beer, not the worst, not the best.

Pours a dark cola brown brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that dissipates to a fine film and off-white ring. Aroma of roasted dark black and Munich style malts, some flowery hops, a touch of chocolate and even some licorice. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonated with flavors of toasted dark malt, a touch of lactose character that reminds me of some sweet stouts. Finish has a semi-sweet and toasted dark malt aftertaste that quickly disappears after the finish.
Randys Fun Hunters Schwarzbier;Whitewater, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Randys Restaurant & Fun Hunters Brewery;Festival tap: Deep, dark brown with smokey caramel nose. hints of licorice, hints of chcolate. Dry peaty finish. Well put together.
Harbor City Father Damien Belgian Wit;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;On tap yesterday at the Old Fashioned: Poured a cloudy golden colour with a fairly large white head. Aroma was pleasent. Soft floral notes, citrus fruits and some yeastiness. Taste is a little too yeasty, and then there�s this underlying watery taste throughout the beer. Overall pretty dissapointing.
Harbor City Father Damien Belgian Wit;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;Draft at the OF. Cloudy unfiltered orange-yellow. A hint of citrus in the aroma. Smooth and light to medium bodied. Refreshing and true to style. Some tart lemony flavors up front lead to a smooth, creamy, yeasty finish. Some grainy malt in the finish. OK, a nice and easy drinker.
Harbor City Father Damien Belgian Wit;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;I still have yet to find a decent American wit. Pours very brown with a decent head. Tastes very sweet and very spicy. Too much coriander and wrong kind of orange peel in my opinion
Harbor City Father Damien Belgian Wit;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;Bottle from a brewery rep. The beer pours to a hazy caramel body with a thin white head. Rich maltiness and nice yeastiness. Coriander and orange peel. Nicely textured lightly spiced palate. A nice drink.

Harbor City Father Damien Belgian Wit;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;On tap at the Wicked Hop in Milwaukee, claimed by waitress to be brewed in Port Washington specifically for the WH. Served with a slice or orange, tossed that. Aroma and flavor had a hint of bubble gum. Medium bodies. More of a fruity than sour character. Minimal head but foamy in the mouth. Finish was orangy, possibly from the slice. Eh.
Harbor City Father Damien Belgian Wit;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;On tap at Wicked Hop Milwaukee. Poured a hazy straw golden with a short cap of white head. Nose was of mild orange zest, darker spices (coriander perhaps), and biscuity malt... rather pleasant, but felt artificially-sweetened. Flavors found about the same stuff... sweet orange-soaked biscuity, light wheaty tartness, and coriander. Palate was a tad too sticky and dense to be super-refreshing, but it felt ok. Finish of citrus and spices lasted for a while. Not bad.
Harbor City Father Damien Belgian Wit;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;Transparent gold with a thin sheet of white for the head. Starchy aroma joins lemons, coriander and biscotti. Subtle lemon-vanilla flavor edge. Nothing is searing or acidic. Light but nut insubstantive. Coriander, biscuits and honey. Very smooth and easy going, almost like it�s from a cask. Smooth vanilla clove finish.
Harbor City Father Damien Belgian Wit;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;Lightly cloudy straw color with a wispy white head. Light malt and coriander nose with a touch more of orange citrus. Light malt and mild grass start. Hints of citrus on the way. Fairly heavy dry spice in the finish. A decent summer quaff, a touch unbalanced.
Harbor City Father Damien Belgian Wit;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;Festival tap: Clear yellow (it�s filtered) with a nose dominated by coriander. Body is light and refreshingly sweet with hints of lemon. Spicy finish is again dominated by, what seems like, mass amounts of coriander.

Taste: grains, pretty bitter touch, bit metallic. Aftertaste: hoppy, metallic, dry, slightly sweet touch."
Walrave Pick Up Pils;Laarne, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Walrave;Equally regional as old school unpasteurized �pils� with limited shelf life, only for sale in Laarne, the village where it is made, by an old family brewery of (extremely) low profile which hardly brews anything else... Firm, snow white, stable head, deep golden blond colour, clear. Aroma of pure pale malts, white bread, grassy hops, young cheese, some iron. Fresh and soft malty taste, neutral to lightly sweetish, bit breadish, sourish touch (probably the yeast which is still there) and delicate grassy hop bitterness in the finish. I consider this among the best of its genre in Belgium, but the genre is still standard pale lager, of course. Tasted from tap but also tasted in its equally old-fashioned form of Pick-Up Export, which is the same thing in 33 cl bottles.
Walrave Pick Up Pils;Laarne, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Walrave;One of the better Pils beers and that�s that. It�s non-pasteuris�! it�s not mass-production, thus hard to find.
Walrave Pick Up Pils;Laarne, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Walrave;"(bottle, 25cl) Slightly hazy, pale golden colour with a blond and short foamy head. Slightly sour pale malty aroma with citric and sweaty hops. Mildly bitter and slightly sour flavour, light to medium bodied with a pleasantly matured carbonation.

Walrave Pick Up Pils;Laarne, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Walrave;Bottle from 100 Belgian Beers To Try Before You Die. Straw colour with a decent white head. Aroma of musty hay, wet cardboard, lemon and soggy cornflakes. Flavours similar with a weird metallic, prawny finger bowl character to finish. Very disappointing.

Water Street Peche Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Water Street Brewery;Sampled on draught at the GTMW �08. Pours a semi-hazy golden straw brew with a thin white head that has some nice retention and spotty lacing. Aroma of white bread malt, apricots and peach character with some light citrus and grassy hops. Taste is light bodied, some carbonation with a good balanced flavors of light wheat malt and peaches. Finish has a light tart peach aftertaste that made this somewhat memorable.
Water Street Peche Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Water Street Brewery;Sampled at Great Taste. This brew was one of the highlights of the festival for me. Even though I could hardly stand by the time I tried this, it was still memorable. Taste similar to a Peach Lambic I tried a couple weeks before and loved. Thank you for bringing this divine creation WSB, thank you very much!
Water Street Peche Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Water Street Brewery;Festival tap: Cloudy gray with nose of over ripe, almost rotten peaches. Medium body was overpowered by mushy peach taste, sugary and syrupy. Actually a bit refreshing, but more than a sample of this would be overdoing it.
Water Street Anniversary Mead;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Water Street Brewery;On tap at GTMW 2012. This was the 20th anniversary mead, too lazy to create an entry. Paler yellow with no head. Aroma of ginger, honey and alcohol. Taste of cingers, cinnamon, crystallized sugar and honey. Finishes up dry.
Water Street Anniversary Mead;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Water Street Brewery;Lighter than I would have expected for a mead, not a whole lot to it. Sweet, easy drinking.
Water Street Anniversary Mead;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Water Street Brewery;Sampled on draft at GTMW 2011. Pours a clear golden color with a large white head. Good head retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet honey and burnt sugar notes. The taste is tart with notes of honey and citrus. Full bodied.
Water Street Anniversary Mead;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Water Street Brewery;On tap at GTMW. Poured clear brighter golden with a surprisingly fizzy cap of white head. The aroma picked up sweet honey with chamomile and other floral notes.. drier on the back and enjoyable. The flavor had dry, spicy honey at the core surrounded by floral notes.. a touch sour around for some reason.. warm, grainy honey rode out the finish. Medium-bodied on the palate.. started sweet and dried out toward the back.. light oaky presence showed right at the end.. OK feel.
Water Street Anniversary Mead;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Water Street Brewery;Sampled on draught at the GTMW �08 via special tapping at 3:30 pm. Pours a clear light golden blonde mead with some thin bubbles on the glass side and no head. Aroma of light clove honey, some butter, citrus zest, and some dandelion. Taste is lightly sweet with flavors of honey, lime zest, and some mild spring flowers. Finish has a slight apple/pear and honey aftertaste that quickly disappears. Lots of character in this mead as the temperature changes.
Water Street Anniversary Mead;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Water Street Brewery;Pours a bright golden colour, with a very nice honey aroma. Light in mouthfeel, very pleasent and unique. Floral tasting as well as a little butter. My first mead and i really enjoyed it.
Water Street Anniversary Mead;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Water Street Brewery;Light straw color with a few fizzy bubbles atop. Light honey, lime zest, cloves and hints of airplane glue. Flowery flavors along with citric acid. Touches of lemon and lime soda. Really did not want to go much farther with this one.
Water Street Anniversary Mead;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Mead;Water Street Brewery;Translucent and pure liquid sol in color with no head as expected. Sweet nectar and buttered cloves hum with cornflakes, lilac petals and gentle perfumed saffron. Distant, light hazelnut sheafs peak in from time to time. Very cold, with quite a husky background. Sweet honey drips elevate post sip and couple with a watery, starch sprayed cotton cleanliness and harshness. Sticking, searing qualities meet honey glazed pils malt. Acidic squeezed lemons transfer into a honey bear squeeze bottle, in tangent with nectar and gingered pear predominance. Minor, harsh bitterness and a tongue scraping wake. Lemon honey clover gains more charismatic sugary sweetness as the carbonation unfurls. Touches of apple cloves point to a sweet, clean and figgy picture as it exits.

Sconnie Tall Blonde Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;William Kuether Brewing;2004 Autumn Brew Review: Gold Coloring. Pretty Watery...Like Soaked Wheat..Some Malt...Pretty Not Right.
Sconnie Tall Blonde Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;William Kuether Brewing;Autumn Brew Review 2004. Pours a nice golden color. Kind of an �off� wheat aroma. Bland malt and wheat taste with a bit of hops. Watery. Not very appealing.
Sconnie Tall Blonde Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;William Kuether Brewing;Festival tap: Very light and toasty Kolsch beer, with tiny hints of roasted marshmallow, thin but refreshing and to style.
Sconnie Pale Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;William Kuether Brewing;Sampled on tap at the brewery. Slightly spicy hop aroma, nice rich golden color. Flavor was off-dry like a hop combination was clashing -- had the dry-hop character of the style but with none of the fruity/floral tones to moderate. Nice thick body would have been more enjoyable had it been carrying a decent flavor with it. Proprietor Bill Kuether acknowledged this beer was a work in progress and that a recipe revision is in the works. Good riddance to this version.
Sconnie Pale Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;William Kuether Brewing;pleasently suprised by a hoppy aroma from the bottle. a brownish orange color with little or no head, body is almost a syrupy thick. flavor is suprisingly strong bitter hoppy flavor. Very hoppy for it�s style and much better than anticipated, flavor isn�t the smoothest and they don�t blend real well. but still a very pleasant suprise, by no means an exceptional beer, but a great start for a young brewer
Sconnie Pale Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;William Kuether Brewing;2004 Autumn Brew Review: Amber Coloring. Small Head. If you Don�t Smell or Taste This Beer, You�ll Be Better Off.. Piney Aroma and Flavor...But Not Like Alba Scots Ale....This was Wrong...Possibly a Bad Batch?
Sconnie Pale Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;William Kuether Brewing;2004 ABR. Aroma is putrid. Smells like a rotting jar of jalapeno peppers. Dark gold, to light amber in color. Very little carbonation. Thin, off-white head. Nice lace. Tastes like it smells. Based on the favorable ratings given by TheDean and marinaro500, either this was a bad batch, or they changed the recipe.
Sconnie Pale Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;William Kuether Brewing;Autumn Brew Review 2004. Pours a decent enough amber color with little head. That�s where the decency stops. Very piney nose. It tastes about the same, like some blend of a Douglas Fir and hops. Blech.
Sconnie Pale Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;William Kuether Brewing;"Sampled at Great taste of the midwest. A small brewery that I had never heard of (neither did ratebeer as they weren�t on here until recently). The Pale was nice; smooth with a citrusy taste."
Sconnie Pale Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;William Kuether Brewing;Festival tap: Toasty pale malts balance this very hoppy pale. Big piney nose and citrusy as well.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Cole Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Pours nearly black with between one and two inches of thick creamy, brown colored head. Excellent, count-the-rings lacing throughout my pint. Um, make that pints. Mild coffee notes in the aroma. Full flavorful bitter chocolate and mild coffee in the taste. Extremely smooth, full bodied. Soft yet prominent carbonation. Very drinkable, yet very rich and filling. Medium bitterness in the aftertaste from a combination of sources. Could be the hops. Could be the roasted coffee/chocolate malt. There�s also a mild tart stone fruit in the aftertaste.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Cole Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Several pints were downed the other day at the pub, but I review this from a growler. Deep, dark black, color of�coffee grounds and burnt toast, with crimson tinges at the edges. Head is light tan, and short-lived in the glass (was bigger & longer at the bar.) Aroma is nice and roasty, earthy, musty, with cocoa notes as well. Taste is substantial, yet smooth as they come, very creamy, drinks down like a dream. Slick feel on the palate at first, then slipping back with a greater ease. Could use a bit more bitterness, for my taste, but then, I�m not who they are trying to please with this. Dark, rich, full of character, yet ridiculously easy to drink. Body is full, finish is about medium length, for it lingers on the palate, but gradually drops off. Pretty tasty stuff, I�ll definitely take this over their other offerings.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Cole Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Tan and creamy/thick head. Dark brown/black body. Nice and Cascade hoppy aroma w/ roasted and slight lactic scents. Delicious chocolate and hoppy flavor with good coffee bitterness. Great porter!
Triumph Double Amber;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triumph Brewing Company;Wow. A total mismatch of caramelly crystal matl and massive grapefruit. Nice try but a washout. Ew!
Triumph Double Amber;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triumph Brewing Company;On tap at New Hope. Pretty, clear copper color with a medium beige head. Sweet aroma of citrus hops and malt. Bitter hop flavor dominates the small amount of sweet malt that I could detect. One dimensional, but fortunately it is a pretty good dimension.
Triumph Double Amber;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triumph Brewing Company;Tap at New Hope. Smells like citrus, pine, orange and caramel. Kind of like Arrogant Bastard. Taste was really smooth but a bit one dimensional. There was kind of a peach yogurt taste in there as well. I got a growler of this because I was impressed.
Triumph Double Amber;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triumph Brewing Company;#300 was celebrated at the New Hope location and this was a great beer to do it with. Pours a red amber with an average size tan creamy nicely lacing head. Aroma of sweet citrus and floral hops. A great hop and malt balance coming through in the aroma. Even started picking up some roasted malts. Flavors of the same with maybe some caramel but also picked up a bit more of the alcohol in the taste, left a slight burning, yet overall warming on a nice cold November day.
Triumph Double Amber;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triumph Brewing Company;[At GABF 2004] A clear copper colored beer with a beige head. The aroma is very hoppy, while the flavor is a combination of caramel and hops. The alcohol is very well hidden - very easily drinkable.
Triumph Double Amber;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triumph Brewing Company;Draft at the Leigh Valley Brewfest in Easton, Pa. From the New Hope, Pa location. Ambers to me a quite boring. This was basically a normal amber with some extra hops. Was a little for bitter than a normal beer bothe that was it. Nothing else stood out.
Triumph Double Amber;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triumph Brewing Company;A little overboard for the style, the hops didn�t blend well with the somewhat weak malt profile
Triumph Double Amber;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triumph Brewing Company;"The hops basically jumped out of the glass, stuck its hand down my throat, and swung me around by my uvula above its head. A wunderbar beer if you want something to sip. I literally could diagram which taste buds are responsible for registering hop bitters while imbibing this libation. Strong but excellent, drink this beer when you want to be kicked in the ass by flavor, not quantity. About 3 of these and my tongue would rot and fester from the amazingly hoppy yet great taste. My only compllaint about this beer is that the hops so overpowered the malt that I honestly couldn�t tell that it existed, except for the rich color. The most opaque amber color ever conceived, I know the malt flavor would ""knock my socks off"" if I could discern it among the fortituous hop bitter flavor."
Triumph Double Amber;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triumph Brewing Company;On draft in New Hope. Gorgeous pint: creamy head, thick lacing. Up there with the double IPAs of late: DFH 90 and Great Divide Hercules. Big hop presence, alcohol well hidden, a big flavorful brew, a touch less aggressive than the DIPAs. Worth the trip to New Hope.
Triumph Double Amber;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triumph Brewing Company;Bitter and rigid, but wonderful. Nice regal-looking color. Sweet palate. A new taste in a New Hope. (200th rating.)
Charlevoix Blanche;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;On tap at Vice et Versa, pours a hazy golden with a small white head.

Charlevoix Blanche;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;On tap at the brewpub. Not bad but not that good. Too fruity for me. Maybe I wil give it another shot.
Charlevoix Blanche;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;on tap at the brewpub. Cloudy yellow pour with a good amount of head. Aroma of wheat, and LOADS of corriander. A great summer beer, so refreshing, and flavorful, there is a great lemon flavor from all the corriander, and the subtle wheat.
Charlevoix Blanche;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;"Started with the sample tray and returned for more than one glass through the night.

Charlevoix Blanche;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;[Tap at the brewpub] An unclear greenish yellow beer with a nice white head. The aroma is sweet whety combined with notes of lemon. The flavor is dry wheat with strong notes of lemon.
Charlevoix Blanche;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;Hazy pale gold, average white foam, no lacing. Heavily spiced nose, obvious tea-like orange and chamomile overwhelms anything else. No maltiness evidence. Mostly spicy, not too sweet, but definitely uncomplex. Frankly dull. Light bodied, carbonation fades quickly.
Charlevoix Blanche;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;Opaque, light tan colour. Malty-perfumey aroma with hints of spices and flowers. I suppose that would be the chamomile, but I drink tea made from tea leaves so I don�t know chamomile so well. Malty, spicy (coriander) flavour with slightly flowery character. Sweetish finish.
Charlevoix Blanche;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;Very clean, fresh, spicy, lavender, floral, chamomile aroma. Cloudy yellow-tan with fizzy, low, white head that recedes to partial cover and ring. Strong, fresh, floral, chamomile flavour with underlying wheat malt base. Medium-light body with low carbonation for style. Sampled at the brewpub with Oakes, Rastacouere and Ungstrup.
Charlevoix Blanche;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;The Lure: Eloquent spiciness introduces tea-like herbaceousness and well-positioned coriander milkiness. Quite attractive for a blanche, in part because of its success in developing a unique identity. The Festivities: Those tea leaves roam about again (must be the camomile), as does the coriander. Grassy at times, fruity and spicy all around. A little thin, but that eases the summer chugging I guess. Another interesting creation by Charlevoix. Transcendence: Herbal tea has its comforting factor.
Charlevoix Blanche;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;Cloudy blonde color, thin head. Aroma of citrus and yeast. Flavor of wheat and citrus. Medium body. Good and refreshing, a classic example of the style.
Charlevoix Abbaye Double;Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Microbrasserie Charlevoix;Reddish brown color, thin head. Inviting aroma of chocolate and alcohol. Flavor of black chocolate and alchol, kind of a sweet and bitter thing. Slightly bitter finish. Medium to full body, soft carbonation.
Portsmouth California Common;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Portsmouth Brewery;Bottle from the brewery shared with my brother. Light orange amber color with a decent off white head. Spicy minty hop with a solid caramel maltiness to back it up. Decent brew.

Pours a slightly hazy amber with a large creamy tan head. Good head retention. Aroma of caramel, citrus, mild nuts. The taste is citrus hops, stone fruits, mild caramel. Medium bodied, crisp.
Portsmouth California Common;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Portsmouth Brewery;22oz Bottle from the Brewery labeled: California Common Assuming this is the same beer.... I have a picture when the add pic feature reappears.... Info from the brew list: Along with Cream Ale, this is America�s other indigenous beer style, made with lager yeast & fermented at 55� to create a fruity lager with a good hop presence. Pours a rich copper color with aromas of noble hops, wheat bread and notes of fruity caramel malts... On the palate its crisp and a great balance between slightly bitter saaz style hops and round malts with glimpses of barley wine finish mixed with a bohemian pilsner... nice light flavorful beer !
Portsmouth California Common;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Portsmouth Brewery;[GABF 2006 � Denver, Co] Nice dark golden color with a light head. This had a great aroma and a flavor that was very much like a deep California common. A good easy summer drinking beer.
Portsmouth California Common;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Portsmouth Brewery;Aroma:pine hops aroma.. Appearance:clear orange,small head.. Flavor:light grapefruit-pine hops,light malt..
Portsmouth California Common;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Portsmouth Brewery;2004 draught. Pours a bright yellow, light straw golden, with a small white head. Aroma has hints of corn/rice or something lightly bittersweet. Something a bit off, anyways. Flavor is more of the same, a rice sharpness, light syrupy bittersweetness on the finish and just too sharp overall. Strange one here.
Suntory Super Blue;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;Can. Clear pale golden colour, short white head. Grainy aroma. Thin mouthfeel. Grainy mild flavour with some medicine. Yummy indeed........
Suntory Super Blue;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;Can thanks to Garrett. A light golden color with a white frothy head. The aroma is mostly malts and some metal. The taste is pretty much par for the course when it comes to Japanese lagers, highly carbonated malts and some grains.
Suntory Super Blue;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;hmm alcoholic water! no aroma, no taste and 5% alcohol. Still, it is nicer than Carlton Pure Blonde.
Suntory Super Blue;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;"A poor example of a beer. I had a side by side with Suntory Malts and Jun Nama, this was by far the worst of the three. Adjunct and metal scents, over carbonated, thin and tasteless. In a word ""Yuck""."
Suntory Super Blue;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;Not sure if it adds any colour to my life, but here goes. Pale yellow body with fizzy white head. Aroma is corny, faint skunk, and some hop. Pretty standard stuff here. Taste is similar to all the Japanese beers I have had to date. Corny, fizy, and lacking in taste. Decent I guess, but nothing special. New beer at least.
Petes Wicked Wanderlust Cream Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Cream Ale;Petes Brewing Company;Wicked Ales were some of the first craft/non-Bud style beers that started me on the road to realy good beer.This one has a nice clear golden yellow color with some light carbonation moving up to a just off white head. This head quickly settles down to a light ring of slick foam. (No lacing) The aroma was mostly grainy, cereal like, with some malt sweetness and herbal hops. On the tongue it is a fairly smooth and has mild malt sweetness and light cereal like gain noted that dry out in the mild herbal finish.
Petes Wicked Wanderlust Cream Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Cream Ale;Petes Brewing Company;Not the best cream ale. A decent mouthfeel, but the flavor has some metallic qualities and there is a cooked broccoli aroma.
Petes Wicked Wanderlust Cream Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Cream Ale;Petes Brewing Company;Wanderlust Cream Ale is a clear, light amber beer with a splotchy, light khaki head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a slightly sweet, grainy, malty aroma with a note of caramel. It�s light bodied, smooth and foamy with a slick finish. It tastes quite sweet. It starts off with sweet light malt and caramel. A light, herbal bitterness comes in later in the taste. The sweetness prevails through the aftertaste. This is too sweet to have more than one, really. Twelve ounces is more than enough.

Petes Wicked Wanderlust Cream Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Cream Ale;Petes Brewing Company;Poured from bottle. Not much nose -- faint citrus and toast is about it. Color is nice, however, a clear amber-gold with a decent head. Taste -- citrus, a very slight herbal tang, and decent hops bitterness on the close. It�s not the greatest beer, but it�s just fine for session drinking.

Heartland Belgian Style Grand Cru;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Greenpoint Beer Works;Empire State Location Pour was modest with little carbonation and little head. The nose was ripe and lush, with candy apple goodness and some clove-like spice. Flvaor was right on, matching the aroma, and featuring the belgian yeast and some spice. Body was a little thin for the style, and the finish was non-descript.
Heartland Belgian Style Grand Cru;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Greenpoint Beer Works;More interesting than the other Heartland beers I had. Paler than I expected -- a blond, almost. Good spice to it, but underly complex yeast profile. Way to tame for me to think of as a Grand Cru, but at least they�re trying. Keep it up.
Heartland Belgian Style Grand Cru;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Greenpoint Beer Works;great start and wonderful on the ole snout, went down smooth for such an alchy bev, but sat rather blandly on the tongue afterwards.
Heartland Belgian Style Grand Cru;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Greenpoint Beer Works;i give major respect to any chain brewery that has the balls to do a grand cru, hell ya. A cloudy amerish color. Lots of spices, peppercorn coriander and some zest on the nose. Thick full body, lots of alcohol, weird rubber powder from the inside of hospital gloves tastes too. damm, much much respect to hearland for having the balls to brew something most people wouldnt like. this rules, well, rules for what i drank in nyc
Heartland Belgian Style Grand Cru;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Greenpoint Beer Works;Cloudy copper/gold color - medium head and very spicy nose, with some slight orange marmalade - alcohol is very evident - it tastes like honey and coriander, with the alcohol pushing its way in, burning the taste buds - totally unbalanced.
Heartland Belgian Style Grand Cru;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Greenpoint Beer Works;Tap @ Spuyten. Burnt orange color when held up to light, hardly any head.

San Miguel Gold Falcon (Eagle);Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel;The ones who gave negative reviews have no idea how to drink this super beer. That is no surprise as the manufactureres have no idea how to market it. It has the reputation of being a beer for '' lower class poor people '' and having no taste. Actually if you pour it into a big glass and leave it , there probably is no great taste. The secret lies in the bubbles . Drink it chilled in a tiny glass, or swig it straight from the bottle, and the gas fills your mouth with a refreshing light taste. No nasty bitter after taste , which one gets with the San Mig Pale Pilsen, no unpleasant shampoo like suds as one gets with San Mig Light. The puzzle is why this, the best of all Philippino Beers, is not more widely available and properly maketed.
San Miguel Gold Falcon (Eagle);Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel;My former girlfriend and now my wife was able to order this beer in Manila every 3rd month having fall in love with this beer way back in our summer vacation in Bohol Philippine last year. Hoping that it will be available soon here in Auckland so we will be able to save an extra expense for online store. Thumbs up for this beer. Perfect for family bonding and taste is amazing.
San Miguel Gold Falcon (Eagle);Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel;A golden lager with a thin white head. In aroma, rather plain Asian crap lager with light Rice adjunct. In mouth, watery and boring, light adjunct laced rice malt, light German hops, light mineral notes, boring. Bottle from a corner store in Boracay, on special at 35 pesos.
San Miguel Gold Falcon (Eagle);Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel;From a bottle. I was told that local university students mix this with a local 8%er Red Horse to make a drink they call the Pegasus, hard to imagine how bad Red Horse must be of this makes it drinkable.
San Miguel Gold Falcon (Eagle);Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel;Well this is most definitely NOT retired as I am sitting here on White Beach in Boracay (attempting to) drink this abomination. Although it is ONLY sold in 1 liter bottles so you know it�s gotta be good! This was the worst beer of the trip. Aroma is straight up piss. Not cat pee like a nice simcoe hop would provide, but actual human urine. My first thought was that someone had actually peed in the bottle and then recapped it. The flavor was only marginally better. Very adjuncty, metallic, and oxidized. It was almost as if they took their Red Horse malt liquor, and cut it with just enough water to drop the abv down to 4.5 and still be able to fill 1000ml bottles. Really bad. stuff.
San Miguel Gold Falcon (Eagle);Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel;In Australia, a �falcon� is now pretty much nationally known as an event when a footballer is smacked in the head by a football (soocer excluded as headers are deliberate falcons). This doesn�t have the same effect on you, unless perhaps you had about a dozen of these piss poor Asian lagers. A better use of the can would be to throw it at the bloody scone of the San Mig brewer who came up this with rubbish in the vain hope you could bring him to his senses and make a beer that had some integrity. Fat chance.
San Miguel Gold Falcon (Eagle);Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel;Canned. Clear golden. Strong appley aroma. Watery with notes of cereals but no hops to be found. Not one of the better tropical lagers.
San Miguel Gold Falcon (Eagle);Mandaluyong City, Metro Manila, Philippines;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel;Can Light blond color. Poor paper-like aroma. Sweet in the front, corn, more bitter at the end. A bit oily and metallic. Quite disgusting.
Great Bear Valley Trash Blonde Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Bear Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub, medium white head, yellow color, malty/grassy aroma. Nice citrus taste with light hops. Very smooth and dangerous. I could get in trouble with this beer.
Great Bear Valley Trash Blonde Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Bear Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a golden/yellow with a medium white head. Aroma of dough, grains, grassy, citrus and some floral. Flavors the mix of the same with a nice hop bitterness. Best beer I had on tap during my visit here.
Great Bear Valley Trash Blonde Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Bear Brewing Company;On tap @ Humpy�s. Ok nose, sweet. Some lager notes, well as I think of them, Toasted grain, sourdough, with orange, honey, grassy in there too. Hazy golden orange color, small to no head, no lacing. Sharp bitter flavors, I though kind of grassy metallic. Lemon came into play, Medium body, lite creamy mouthfeel, sweet smooth finish. I was diggin this one, seemed to jump a couple catagories. I wasn�t sure what to call it as Humpy�s had it under the Golden/lager/pilsner umbrella. I see we have it under ASA.
Great Bear Valley Trash Blonde Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Bear Brewing Company;(Draft: Caf� Amsterdam in Anchorage, AK) I really don�t know what to make of this beer. Categorized as an Imperial Blonde by the very knowledgeable bartender at Caf� Amsterdam, listed as 8% both at this bar and at the brewery, I swear it doesn�t seem to even be over 6%. Mildly sweet and very fruity, featuring tropical fruits, peach, orange citrus, and just a mild bitterness in the finish. The aroma is sweet and fruity as well with very light malts in the background. Light body, but with enough sweetness that it sticks on the palate, filling every crevice. Dark straw color, very hazy in appearance. White head fades to a thin rim, but leaves lots of spiderweb lacing on the glass. Just an odd duck, and I really want to like it more than I actually do. Still, for a golden ale (albeit an amped up alcoholic one), it�s not bad.
Great Bear Valley Trash Blonde Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Bear Brewing Company;"Draft at the brewpub 7/14/05: Bright yellow with a firm head. Nice lemony citric flavors pour out of the aroma; there is a hint of the alcohol, but this drinks way too easy for the punch. Very good."
Great Bear Valley Trash Blonde Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Bear Brewing Company;On tap at the 2005 Great Alaska Beer and Barley Wine Festival. I had several samples of this odd little beer. Murky yellow color with almost no bubbles. Strong pine nose. This beer has lots of hops in the flavor with orange peel and lots of pine and a raw grain sweetness. Not bad, but odd.
Great Bear Valley Trash Blonde Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Bear Brewing Company;Had on tap at the brewpub in Wasilla, Ak. Named in honor of the loving name bestowed upon the residents of this region - the Matanuska Valley of Alaska. Pours a nice golden color with a generous white head. Sweet honey like aroma. Same honey essence carries over to the flavor. Creamy mouthfeel. One of the better blondes I have had from a brewpub.
Hardys & Hansons Cursed Galleon;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Hardys & Hansons;Cask (handpump) Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem, Nottingham. It doesn�t get much better than a great pint of H&H in one of their best pubs. Smooth, fruity in an alcohol-berry-chocolate way, a decent strong mild.
Hardys & Hansons Cursed Galleon;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Hardys & Hansons;Veyr nic ein flavour, but very alcoholic, it almost made me drunk after os many beers. But the foam was very good.
Hardys & Hansons Cursed Galleon;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Hardys & Hansons;May, 2005. JDW, Rochester. Nice. Juicy red cherry, chocolate, English trifle and coffee blend well in this fascinating and very drinkable mild.
Hardys & Hansons Cursed Galleon;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Hardys & Hansons;Hand pulled at Wetherspoons, Paradise Forum, Birmingham. Deep, menacing darkness, reminiscent of the beer�s name. A flavour, which is indeed difficult to adequately pin down (as others have said): I got wine and choc. I found this a little sour (bad sour), and with a wince inducing, lingering heaviness. Tastes stronger than it is, and is not something I would rush to try again.
Hardys & Hansons Cursed Galleon;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Hardys & Hansons;Cask (My clip said 5% though?): Deep dark ruby in colour with a small beige head. Toffee aroma with a touch of roast. Flavour is mostly toffee (caramel) but has some oaky notes, along with chocolate. Almost a touch of ash/smoke in there too. Bit thin in body though. Interesting, but lacks body and character.
Hardys & Hansons Cursed Galleon;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Hardys & Hansons;Cask 5% at the �Spoon May Fest. Great beer. Bags of flavour: coffee, chocolate, morello cherries - great. All worked together in a beatiful zippy harmony. Great. Great. Great. Zippy!
Hardys & Hansons Cursed Galleon;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Hardys & Hansons;Heavy and dark, with that strange chicory taste I find in many dark bitters. Somewhat enjoyable, if you�re in that masochistic mood.
Hardys & Hansons Cursed Galleon;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Hardys & Hansons;Full marks to H & H for having the guts to produce a strong mild. Except I though it was tending more towards a winter warmer/old ale style a la Old Peculier. Very dark brown, almost black, with a reddish tinge. There�s nothing very pronounced on the aroma. Maybe some mildly vinous notes. Berry fruits, caramel and maybe a hint of licorice in the flavour. Quite light bodied. This was a perfectly pleasant beer but a bit understated. I found it difficult to get a handle on. Now brewed at 5.0%. Cask (handpump), Willow Walk (JDW), May Beer Festival, Victoria, London SW1.
Hardys & Hansons Cursed Galleon;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Hardys & Hansons;cask at Wetherspoons , Ashford, Kent. Very dark ruby/black. Burnt malt nose, rich dark matl fruit with some burntness. Alcohol on finish with some dryness.
Hardys & Hansons Cursed Galleon;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Hardys & Hansons;Cask at Chappel Beer Festival. This beer was discribed as a Mild, not sure about that as it is 5.5% ABV but also it was not sweet as I expected from H&H. It is almost black with beige head, this is not sweet but rather sour like a porter with various flavours in the aroma and taste, interesting but not a beer I would drink alot of.
Great Bear Williwaw Honey Ginger Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Bear Brewing Company;(Draft: Great Bear Brewing Co. in Wasilla, AK) Ginger, yes. Honey, no. Flavors of ginger and what seems to be coriander, plus some wheat malt, but I don�t taste or smell any honey. It�s minimally sweet and lightly bitter, but the finish is almost flavorless. Spicy, ginger nose, perhaps some mild wheat aroma. Very light body, thin and watery. Pale straw color is lightly hazy. Creamy white head is comprised of very tiny bubbles, but fades to a ring while leaving a bit of patchy lace. Not my thing.
Great Bear Williwaw Honey Ginger Ale;Wasilla, Alaska, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Bear Brewing Company;Had on tap at the brewpub in Wasilla, Ak.

On tap at the brewpub with DYCSoccer17, MartinT and Rastacouere.
City Steam Deirdre Does Dublin;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Dry;City Steam Brewery;Rubbery aroma frightening the roasty creaminess...A skeleton of a body dissipates all idea of pleasure...I hope the brewer�s called Deirdre, because this name would be awful otherwise...
City Steam Deirdre Does Dublin;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Dry;City Steam Brewery;Deep garnet pour, not opaque. Small tan head, non lasting. The glass is very cold to the touch. Brown sugar aroma, very faint. Light coffee aroma also, more aromatic as it warms. Roasty malt flavor, almost too much carbonation. Choco-bitterness to finish. Probably much better served room temperature.
Capitol City Cherry Wheat;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Capitol City Brewing Company;From notes (BTW, they called this Sakura Cherry Wheat) Was not overwhelmed with this, but it was pleasant. Was with non-beer geek friends, so may not have paid enough attention to the beer.

Spilker Monkeywrench Brown Ale;Cortland, Nebraska, United States;Brown Ale;Spilker Ales;It doesn�t look like Sam is ever going to make Monkeywrench again, or if he does, then it never seems to be on sale anywhere near me. This was the first and best Spilker beer. Monkeywrench was dark brown with an off white colored head. While the head was not huge or durable, the beer was a good looking one. The Aroma was a very strong and pronounced bananas! Great esters to this beer. The palate was thick and chewy. Hop bitterness was mild and the roasted flavor was well-balanced with the sweetness. In 1997, this was a beer that I sought out and went to bars just because they served Monkeywrench. A couple spots on O Street in Lincoln carried it. Today, the tap handle at the Crescent Moon for Monkeywrench has been retired to a display. Oh Sam, why have you forsaken us?

Brink's Blonde;Rethymno, Crete, Greece;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Rethymnian Brewery;Very bad head, doesn�t last long. A bit hazy, golden in colour. Fruits, raisins, malts in aroma. Taste is very bland, malty. Almost no bitterness. Dull.
Brink's Blonde;Rethymno, Crete, Greece;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Rethymnian Brewery;Probably. Dark out here listening to the surf crash like cymbals. Slim white head. Good clean slightly perfumed aroma comprising shrub, rusk, lemon and lime jelly and jasmine. Slick and mellow with citrus, hints of flowers, biscuit and gummy lime. Traces of nut. Jasmine again. Likeable.

Brink's Dark;Rethymno, Crete, Greece;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Rethymnian Brewery;Bottle, Crete, April 2018. One of the beers I ran 7 miles carrying a 5kg carrier of jangling bottles to source. HERO. The chainsmoking locals sat on white plastic chairs sipping espresso on the pavement loved it. Easily beer of the trip. Well made, balanced, clean and greasy copper reminiscent of an unfiltered Keller. Slick white lid. Fresh shrub sap, grassy and sesame aroma. Long milk chocolate capped digestive and cocoa dusted plum taste. Not dark. Mildly beautiful

Stoudts Fat Dog Stout (Vintages 2004 and later);Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stoudts Brewing Co.;"From Aug 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! A nice close to pitch black in colour with an inch of tan foam. That soon disappears barely leaving even a ring around the glass. The smell has notes of roasted malt, some caramel and some fruit. The taste has a good robust roastiness up front, with mild coffee and more noticeable chocolate, both milk and bitter. Nice flavour here. The sweet and the bitter are very balanced and it's no chore to take sip after sip. Mouthfeel borders on medium, the carbonation also borders on medium, it finishes with a good dark chocolate bitterness that is long lasting. A nice brew and the 9%abv is very well hidden. Well, this is my first Stoudt's brew that I'm reviewing and I think I'll try to find some more of their ""stuff"" in the future."
Stoudts Fat Dog Stout (Vintages 2004 and later);Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stoudts Brewing Co.;"We picked this one up because we wanted to support the fat dog in their struggle against weight bias. It is a year old but was on sale so what can you do. This is the first review of my 30s, and if it were up to me I would say ""smells like wet dog, tastes like wet dog, too smoky to exist, 2.7."" But, booboo likes it, so what can ya do. Apparently the aroma is sweet smoke and syrupy brown sugar, the appearance is dark brown/black, and the taste is a slight mouth yak feel of a Baltic porter combined with a blunt sugary fizz.Good for onesie juiceing on a Wednesday night with your cutie patootie."
Stoudts Fat Dog Stout (Vintages 2004 and later);Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stoudts Brewing Co.;12 oz bottle. The pour is a nice black-ish color with a thin ring of light khaki head, somewhat bubbly. It poured a bit thin, but it�s not terrible. The aroma is interesting. There is a light roastiness to it and a bit of chocolate. A light sweetness and a hint of metallic exists. It�s a little sweeter and there is a hint of licorice and a slight bittering aspect to it. The flavor is interesting. There is a lot more of a bitter roast and a chocolate. The metallic tendency of the malts is in full swing. It�s got a dark fruit thing happening that isn�t the best, but it adds something. The mouth feel is decently thick with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly metallic sweetness on the finish. Meh.
Stoudts Fat Dog Stout (Vintages 2004 and later);Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stoudts Brewing Co.;Pours a flat cloudy brown. Looks a bit watery. Aroma of syrup and light coffee notes. Taste is sweet with a slightly coffee note.
Stoudts Fat Dog Stout (Vintages 2004 and later);Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stoudts Brewing Co.;Poured from a 12ozbottle. Black ink with a tan head.

Stoudts Fat Dog Stout (Vintages 2004 and later);Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stoudts Brewing Co.;bB backlog, bottle from Canals West Deptford. Faced on a cold night in December. Pours a deep black color with a medium sized head. Notes are huge on fudge and other sweet chocolate. Also some dark malt, toast, and coffee. Really creamy and smooth mouthfeel. I like this stout from stoudts

Stoudts Fat Dog Stout (Vintages 2004 and later);Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stoudts Brewing Co.;"Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass at ""The Pub"" in Gettysburg, PA. This beer is a pitch black offering with a nice tan head. The aromas is full of roasted grains and cocoa. the taste is a lot like the aroma with some cocoa, coffee and malt blended well for a flavorful event. My favorite Imperial Oatmeal Stout to date."
Hyde Park Barrel 9 Dunkleweizen;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Location: Draft at the Brewpub as Chocolate Wheat, but it appears to be the same beer based on j12601�s review, 10/2/10 Aroma: It has a malty nose, some roast, some chocolate, and just a drop of wheat Appearance: It pours into the glass a clear brown-orange color Flavor: The flavor is rather malty, it�s interesting, and it�s similar to the nose Palate: This one has a light-medium body, it is drinkable, and it has a decent feel Overall Impression: This one is more malty then wheaty. It almost feels more like a Belgian Dubbel then a German Dunkleweizen to me, as I didn�t get a ton of wheat in this one. Anyway, this one was interesting for sure. While it wasn�t a great beer, it has some interesting characteristics, and it was a good effort.
Hyde Park Barrel 9 Dunkleweizen;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Hyde Park Brewing Company;"On tap at the brewpub, and being called ""Chocolate Wheat"" now. Pours a Clear brown with copper and orange highlights under a large beige head, which falls off fast. Aromas of faint cocoa, sweet tart wheat, metal, and roast. Flavors of soured cocoa, metal, wheat, a tart sweetness. Weird. Finishes with some roast, cocoa, chocolate, and tart wheat. Better than expected."

Hyde Park Barrel 9 Dunkleweizen;Hyde Park, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Hyde Park Brewing Company;Fruity and very sweet aroma with some bubblegum esters. Clear burnished copper coloured body with a dense and lasting cover of fine bubbled white head. Fruity esters are strong (berries and bubblegum) but offset by the lightly tart wheat character. Medium light body with moderately crisp carbonation. Sampled on tap at the brewpub with Olivier_MTL and Rastacouere.
Ramapo Valley Divine Light;Hilburn, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Grassy lemon nose - very light straw like malt. Some almost vinous character. Overly bitter orangely lemon - malt is there by somewhat sour. Very meh.
Ramapo Valley Divine Light;Hilburn, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Pours yellow and cloudy with no noticable head. Calling this one a California common is generous as it makes BMC taste good by comparison. While I thought it was interesting, the malt character was unstable and watery.
Ramapo Valley Divine Light;Hilburn, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Ramapo Valley Brewery;I have been holding tis rating for quite a while, so, here it goes.

Springhead Willys Wheatbeer;Laneham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Springhead Brewery;Pungent, sour aroma. Refreshingly light but with too sour an aftertaste for my liking. A welcome if imperfect wheat beer.

La Tongrinnoise Chrysalide;Tongrinne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie la Tongrinnoise;"Just off-white, luxurious head; very clear red-to-brown ale, but end of bottle fully opaque. Very fruity nose, grapes, raisins, rhubarb, actually more than a tad lambic-y. Fruity taste, tomatoes and marjoram; grapes again and finishes just a tad woody. Needs the yeast to develop all its flavours, the clear beginning is too lifeless. Sourishness at the end reminds again of lambic. Refreshing, yet very full body. Very nice beer, definitely worth looking for - yet I wonder whether this taste was intentional?"
La Tongrinnoise Chrysalide;Tongrinne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie la Tongrinnoise;Light cloudy somewhat dark amber colourd beer with a big head. The aroma is light molasses and some spice, maybe corriander. The taste is light sour, somewhat burned and a bit flat. The aftertaste is chalky and a bit dry.

Rooster Fish Dark Nut Brown Ale;Watkins Glen, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Rooster Fish Brewing;Sampled on tap at the brewpub Pours a cloudy dark brown color with a thinnish tan head that dissipates quickly. Smells of roasted malts and coffee. Slightly nutty and earthy. Smells like this is going to be darker than a nut brown ale. Taste is roasted coffee, chocolate, nutty, earthy, malty. Finishes a bit on the dry side with a long lingering roasted grain. Very tasty, but almost porter or stout like with a lot of roasted grain going on here. Medium to thin body and level of carbonation. I really enjoyed this beer, but again its hard to call it a nut brown.
Rooster Fish Dark Nut Brown Ale;Watkins Glen, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Rooster Fish Brewing;On tap at the Crooked Rooster Pub. Dark black pour with a tan head.

Rooster Fish Dark Nut Brown Ale;Watkins Glen, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Rooster Fish Brewing;On tap at Tully�s in Amherst, NY. Very intriguing beer. Has the smell of a nut brown with the hazelnut, but also has some chocolate and caramel notes. Beer has the look of a stout, like a standard Guinness, only with a lighter-colored brown body. Still opaque though. Flavor has a ton of caramel, very sweet although somewhat dry finish. Had the creamy body of a stout but the taste of a sweet nut brown. Not bad.

Traffic Jam California Strong Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Traffic Jam and Snug;Deep golden hue, short-lasting white head. Very fruity nose with almost no traces of alcohol. Tartish apples and pear mixture makes for a weird match with the leafy, floral and citrusy american hops. Citric bite with fruit acids, yet very sweet and desserty. Bready yeastiness doesn�t deploy too much character while the spicy fruitiness dominate. Light-medium bodied, lowish carbonation.
Traffic Jam California Strong Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Traffic Jam and Snug;Golden, to copper in color, with a tight white head which leaves very little lace on the glass. Somewhat cidery bouquet, with hops in the background. The flavor is quite a departure from the aroma, bitter and malty (not overly sweet), with some spices in the background. The finish reminds me of vaguely of pumpkin pie. I like the flavor that lingers on my tongue, like toffee. This is a nice warmer for late summer
Traffic Jam California Strong Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Traffic Jam and Snug;Tap. Pours a lighter copper color. Decent white head. Aroma is of malt and hops. Taste is immediately malty and then very hoppy. Alcohol is apparent. Decent, rough around the edges.
Whitbread Pale Ale (UK);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);"Not too impressed by this ""Pale Ale�. A rather boring beer I won�t purchase again."
Whitbread Pale Ale (UK);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Rated from old notes. Drank this one on a visit to London and was stunned because it was not the Whitbread I remembered. Only later did I confirm the American and English brews were completely different. Thin, watery, and textureless. Disappointing.
Whitbread Pale Ale (UK);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);330ml bottle. Dark amber color. Small size, yellow head, stays. Metallic, minerals, corny, malty aroma. Grainy, faint hop pellets in taste. So watery and thin. Touch of salt in aftertaste.
Whitbread Pale Ale (UK);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Amazed to find this in a small grocer�s in an isolated corner of the West Islands while on holiday. Haven�t had it in over 20 years. Looks decent in the class. Fairly yellowy brown with lots of old school frothy head and beaucoup de clingy lacing. A malty toffeeness with a trace of metallic to taste. Bit tired. Not dynamic but not unpleasant either.Thin, little stuffing. A blast from the past and a reminder of how much bottle beer has improved here.
Whitbread Pale Ale (UK);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);I�ve tried both the British and American versions and the American version is far better. This version is a cloudy reddish-gold with a medium-sized off-white head. Aroma is sweet malt, and floral hops. The flavour is mildly malty with a medium bitter finish.

Whitbread Pale Ale (UK);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Bottle @ random bar. I asked for the stout but I am pretty sure that this is what I got. Clear amber with a white head. Malty, pale, cheaper, more iron, odd lingering spices, almost mint and mineral bitter aftertaste, quite odd and off-putting, bitter and a touch of not the finest hops. Lighter bodied. Not too good.

Brewer's Alley Imperial Stout;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery;"Wow, either been awhile since has been made or been reviewed. Either way it was there today at lunch on cask. Served in a tulip glass, rich dark brown color with tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, light chocolate and some dark fruit. Taste was aroma balanced with a light hop note. Somewhat lighter then the usual IS, but the aroma and flavor was definitely there. Good winter offering, it is the base of the ""Brewed Awaking"" where it�s aged with coffee (had that too)."
Brewer's Alley Imperial Stout;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery;Poured dark brown with a tan sticky head and nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of roast coffee, anise, light chocolate and fig aroma. Light roast, some chocolate, medicinal, almost cherry cough syrup taste. Thin.
Brewer's Alley Imperial Stout;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Stout - Imperial;Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery;Pitch black ale. Opaque, cola color when held up to very bright light. Small, creamy, off-white head. Minimal lacing. Notes of espresso, dark chocolate and black strap molasses/licorice in the nose. Charred flowers. Well-bittered, like Storm King or Dark Lord, but the body is much lighter and the ABV is much lower. Still, big props for being compared to those two wonderful beers. Medium to full-bodied with an astringent mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Lengthy, dry, burnt, bitter finish. Too thin for the style, but a terrific beer nonetheless.

Long sweet aftertaste. Pretty good.

The girl with the protruding stomach, as is the fashion here for all girls who don�t have a figure, looked at me blankly. Of course, you know about bare not beer don�t you sweetie? Yeah, sweet, cloying pineapple/passionfruit bubblegum. Atrocious.
Outback Lawson Lager;Woodpark, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Outback Brewery;NFOB 2004. Sully paid for this and gave it to me in disgust. Horrid passionfruit flavour as if they�d used icecream topping. Some pineapple and bubblegum as well. Not sure what it is supposed to be, but it is a drain pour for certian. Heavy mouthfeel, yuck.

Outback Dusty Road;Woodpark, NSW, Australia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Outback Brewery;The Outback range is a struggle, but this is plain undrinkable. Chucked it after half a bottle. Claims to be a bottle-fermented summer ale. In fact, it was a sour monster, like sucking lemons dipped in caster sugar. Caramel colour, fleeting head. Some cloves in the peppery nose. Thin-bodied and totally unacceptable. (Bottle)

Oakham Red Neck;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Oakham Ales;Hand pulled cask at the Mermaid, St. Albans. Amber with an off white head.

Phoenix Lager;Breda, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Dutch Breweries;Can in Lima, Peru. Almost no head, weak pale lager body. Sour, disgusting grain on nose. A bit fizzy, oddly sweet-sour body. A hint of the offensive I must say. It is not abhorrent but I have no desire to finish more than a few sips of this.
Phoenix Lager;Breda, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Dutch Breweries;A 0.33 l can, thanks Marko! It poured a lighter golden body with a small head atop. Grainy, hay and dusty aroma.

Phoenix Lager;Breda, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Dutch Breweries;This is one of the odd imported industrial lagers sold in some supermercados in Costa Rica. The aroma is saccharine-like (nutrisweet) with quiet dirty notes of cosmetics and grime, and DMS becomes more apparent as it warms. It�s medium-light bodied and lightly sweet with low bitterness, and the malt does contribute some richness to the body. Limp and quick carbonation froth is followed by a syrupiness and more of that fruity-cosmetics dirtiness in the finish.

It has a lot of carbonation. It finishes with a real light bitterness but sort of dry as well. It sort of reminds of a cross of wine and champagne on the finish. This beer is a little different. That would be the best way to sum it up. But it�s worth a shot. It�s no session beer.

Van Pur Karpackie Mocne;Warsaw, Poland;Pale Lager - Strong;Van Pur S.A.;500ml can from T Market, drunk at home. Pours clear with a very brief frothy head. No lacing or bead. Golden amber in colour. Aroma of corn, bread and resin, no spirit despite the high ABV. In the mouth, lively at first due to high carbonation, soon releasing flavours of cereal, corn and malt. Medium bitterness and a touch of sweetness. Overall, a bit too bland for a strong lager, but finally, a Van Pur brew that doesn't totally suck.

Richbrau Pre-Prohibition Pils;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Sweetish smell, faint hops. Medium gold, good lacing. Flavor is odd. Starts sweet, burst of floral hops, bit of anise, then a corny finish. Someone hopped my Coors. Rerate at VA Beer Festival on 7/3/09. Clear light gold, aroma of corn and a bit of butter. Flavor was muted, corn, light floral hops, hint of blackberry. Got more butter in the nose than the mouth. I usually don�t detect diacetyl very well, so this was odd. I should also note that no one else was picking up diacetyl, so in all likelihood something else was at work here that I was picking up on. Rating went up by .1.

Dark ruby red appearance with a solid mocha colored head. Aroma is like a fruit cocktail with alcohol - enticing. Flavor has some elements of brandy, raisins, dates and a back end of chocolate. Mouthfeel is thick and syrup - like a barley wine should. Excellent - they should keep this recipe around.

B�heim Pils;Pegnitz, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Boeheim - Brauer-Vereinigung Pegnitz;Bottle consumed in Nov. 2015, best by Mar. 2016. Pale blonde. Broken, fine-bubbled white foam. Clean and airy, but simple, aroma of lemon, grass, toasted crackers and a touch of nectar. Light in body. Foamy carbonation. Mild soapy notes are negated by an appealing, albeit muted, blend of bright lemon and nectar. Basic pils malt character of uncured hay dries things out, but doesn�t offer much in terms of textural richness. Sprucelike hop whispers mark the lean finish along with a cleansing wash of minerals, lemon and grassy malt. Not especially dynamic, but it�s a solid pils. Someone should encourage the brewer to ramp up the hops (and malt, for that matter), because the cleanliness here would serve the adjustments well.
B�heim Pils;Pegnitz, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Boeheim - Brauer-Vereinigung Pegnitz;50cl bottle. Pours clear pale golden colour with a mid-sized most good lasting white head.

B�heim Pils;Pegnitz, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Boeheim - Brauer-Vereinigung Pegnitz;Bottle best by March 2016. Clear gold with a short white head of average retention and some lacing. Extremely quiet aroma is mineral-forward and lightly hoppy, smelling faintly of herbs and lemon peel with mostly transparent malt (saltine cracker?). Light bodied, off-dry, effervescent, lightly starchy and saccharine-like, strongly minerallic with notes of calcium and granite and concrete. It�s mostly clean but just so limited in ingredient expression, I feel like if it were well-hopped and had rich malt we would have something good on our hands. Nicely effervescent and fluffy, albeit bracing in the mouth like seltzer water, but with the light malt sweetness it works. Just needs more of everything.

Well tied-in prominent herbal, grassy bitterness that persists down the throat just enough to make you return for another tilted barrel pour. Almost as memorable as its surroundings.

Virtually no carbonation in an amber-colored beer poured into a Steinkrug. No bubbles. Rather aromatic: biscuit, herbs, dark honey. Tangy, dusty bitter, with mild caramel streak and then rolling through a lasting bitter aftertaste. Not sure why the bottle is flat, but it tastes more interesting than most bottled Kellerbiers. Still not as lively and tasty as the stuff from the Anstich at the mouth of the cellar, at the Schmausenkeller. Special place with a massive playground. Bring the tots.
M�ller Br�u Reundorf Kellerbier;Frensdorf-Reundorf, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei M�ller Reundorf;From gravity barrel at Schmausenkeller in Reundorf. Moderately hazy golden yellow with a short but fine white head and slowly cascading carbonation. Aroma is moderately yeasty / doughy, sulfuric and hoppy in the nose with notes of flowers and apricot and lemon. Quiet malt is toasty and cracker-y with faint sugar cookie notes. Medium body and enjoyably rich, light to moderately sweet, sticky and lasting mouth feel with moderate to strong finishing bitterness for its size. Fresh and lively, just a tad doughy and soapy in the same way as the Lieberth / Rittmayer Haus Kellerbier, but remains lip-smacking and succulent and the fruity-floral hop expression is nice.

Moonshot;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;New Century Brewing Company;Sweet malt aroma with faint hint of hops. Gold color. Full creamy white head. Sweet malt flavor but not cloying. Very smooth body. Very easy drinking. This is a beer you could drink a lot of. For the style, this is actually very nice. For a style I don�t typically enjoy, this is pretty tasty. Contrary to the description above, this beer is still brewed. The label is different and it has 69mg of caffeine now.
Moonshot;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;New Century Brewing Company;"12oz bottle. Bought mostly as a novelty - I�d recently seen Beer Wars and recognized this beer at the grocery store (and was surprised to see it down here in GA). The movie didn�t give me any sense that the beer would actually be good, but the grocery store allows you to ""mix a six"", so I only had to buy one bottle. Good thing... Pours crystal clear and yellow gold in color - thin white head that persists - endless stream of bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass. Aroma is malty and sweet with hints of sweet corn and a light graininess. Flavor is lightly sweet - light cereal grains and subtle sweet corn, light floral hop character. Neutral finish - aftertaste is malty with some light fruitiness. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and sudsy and lightly tingly and creamy. Overall, a very plain and totally uninteresting lager. It�s hard to believe that the woman who started this came from Sam Adams, which tends to put much more focus in actual flavor. Flavor is not the focus of this product - I think the focus is more of the caffeine gimmick..."

Simply put, the finish is downright icky. Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: All Systems Gack! With or without the caffeine, it�s a woefully unpleasant beer. Swap out one of the O�s in Moonshot with an I and that�s a bit more accurate."
Moonshot;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;New Century Brewing Company;Had this one at a beer fest in Hull Mass. Has a clear light golden color. Aroma is of malts and hops. Taste is of sweeter malts, hops, and grain. Has a little bite in the end.
Moonshot;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;New Century Brewing Company;Pours a clear gold with a small white head. Aroma is metallic with some biscuits and grass. Flavor is sweet with a metallic finish. For a novelty beer this is decent.
Moonshot;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;New Century Brewing Company;found an old bottle on the clearance shelf for a buck. a hazy gold pour under a small frothy white head. buttery aroma. flavor is not bad with a hint of butter and caramel. light bodied. no flavor alteration from the caffeine. cleared up my headache from working in the sun all day. about as much caffeine as 1/2 a cup of coffee.
Moonshot;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;New Century Brewing Company;Had this beer on 4/16/2006. Aroma has an almost dusty smell to it, reminds me of old dusty glass. Color is a bright clear gold with good carbonation and a thin head. Taste is light, smooth and sweet. Starting with a light body it goes down easy with a smooth feel. Finish comes on with a light malt flavor that is mildly sweet then ends with a faint bitterness. Other then the aroma it is a nice well balanced Pilsner.
Moonshot;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;New Century Brewing Company;Notes of water and rice. Very little/almost no head. A little sweet kick in the after-taste. Surprisingly not too objectionable. With the caffeine this would be a great beirut beer. Wish I had known of it back then.
Grand Rapids Tenth Anniversary Barley Wine;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;"brownish rootbeer appearance with almost no head; aroma is wonderful (heavy in bourbon, sugars, caramels, spices)...flavor is very similar but dominated by bourbon, with hints of vanilla and a touch of alcohol...a very appetizing beer"
Grand Rapids Tenth Anniversary Barley Wine;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;"Poured from a quaint little 7-ounce clear bottle. Deep red-brown (almost sanguine) body, thin/medium off-white to light cream head (my bottle doesn�t look flat). Big brown sugar, caramel, tannic aroma. Oaky sourness makes a strong impression, and the overall effect is quite English and old aleish. I could sniff this all night. Flavorwise, the oak and vanilla really dominate, with an undercurrent of brown sugar and a touch of fruit. Alcohol is also big. I was expecting a bit more character in the flavor after enjoying the aroma, but sour, tannic oak pretty much overwhelms the malts and hops, which probably should have been used in more substantial quantities to offset the wood. I still think this ""works,"" however, and would pair nicely with a cigar. Interesting beer."
Grand Rapids Tenth Anniversary Barley Wine;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Aged in bourbon casks. The color of this stuff is unappetizing -- sort of dull ruddy brown to amber. It looks flat as stagnate water. What it lacks in appearance, however, it more than makes up for in aroma and flavor. The bourbon is perceptible at first whiff as well as some nice phenol traces and maltiness. This stuff is characterized by its malt complexity and bourbon overtones. Very very good. If it could only be a little prettier ...
Die Weisse Hell;Salzburg, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Die Weisse - Salzburger Weissbierbrauerei;330ml bottle. Hazy, orangey dark golden to amber colour with average to huge, frothy, moderately lasting and lacing, white head. Wheaty, slightly bready, malty and yeasty fruity aroma, notes of banana, dried banana, leafy overtones, some orange, a touch of clove. Taste is slightly sweet, minimally bready, wheaty malty and minimally citrusy hoppy, hints of banana, a touch of pear, lemon, clove, orange. Creamy texture, smooth and soft palate. Very nice.

P- Light body, average texture, average carbonation, balanced finish. O- Pretty sure I had the blonde but it's not listed on here and perhaps I misjudged.

Die Weisse Hell;Salzburg, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Die Weisse - Salzburger Weissbierbrauerei;Shared bottle on train from Salzburg to Innsbruck with IPT 16.04.19. Hazy hay colour. Off-white head and lacing. Aroma of banana, coriander, wheat and smoke. Slightly sour taste of wheat, coriander, marmalade and malt.
Die Weisse Hell;Salzburg, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Die Weisse - Salzburger Weissbierbrauerei;getrunken im Sommer 2016 Dieses Wei�bier hat eigentlich alles, was ein gutes Wei�bier haben muss: guter Bananenbeigeschmack mit den sortentypischen Aromen, Sch�ne Krone und eine angenehme Tr�be. Auch wenn es schwer zu bekommen ist, so ist es wirklich zu empfehlen.
Thirsty Bear Bulldog EPA;San Francisco, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Thirsty Bear Brewing Company;Tap. Light amber, crisp and minty aroma, with maybe some apples in it. A little skunk in the flavor - where did all the hops run off to? It�s hard to be critical of any particular aspect of this beer, but I wouldn�t go out of my way to order a pint.
Great Waters Cherry Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Waters Brewing;Cask-conditioned: Nearly black, almost, just close enough, with a nice, cocoa-tan head proudly roosting atop. Nose is roasty and sweet, emitting plenty of fruity, cherryish notes, black currants, blackberries, more than merely cherries, though that indeed is what went into this brew. I had beermatrix at my elbow telling me it was too sweet, but it was just enough for this guy, pretty well-balanced, although in truth, the body�s a bit too thin for a stout of my liking. Texture is slick, creamy, easy to take, but the finish is long, and the flavor lasts and lasts...just isn�t full enough in body, though. Very nice, I must say, an excellent accomplishment from this brewry, and I hope to return for more before too long.
Great Waters Cherry Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Waters Brewing;Nice black color with a good, foamy, Guinness like head. Very faint cherry aroma. Good malt presence in the taste along with an excellent offering of cherries. It definitely has that Kriek kick to it. Fairly thick as well. One of the good ones!
Great Waters Cherry Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Waters Brewing;Black Coloring. Small Sandyi Head. Cherry is Apparent in Aroma and Flavor...almost Reminds one of a Framboise...and then the Malt of the Stout Kicks in... Very Smooth... But one of the Better Offerings at Great Waters.
Great Waters Cherry Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Waters Brewing;On-cask at the brewpub: Lovely off brown yellowy color as it casacades from the pull. Finally settles to a very solid dark brownish black color with some dark ruby slivers nearer the bottom. The head is the most remarkable thing about this one. Majorly thick 3/4 inch cap thats evenly distributed and incredibly smooth with not a bubble to be found. It looks like chocolate milk sitting on top of used motor oil. Gorgeous! Aroma is soft and yeilding with some light roasty black malt sweetness with a nice mild mix of dark cherry and a dash of cocoa. Taste is just as mellow and mildingas the smell, smooth and soft roasted malts that are touching some sweetness, a brief coffee note close to the front, middle maintains a sweeter ride with the soft dark cherry tang delicately swooping across. Ends with bit more heightened tang of the cherry left on the lips and the back of the palate, notes of cocoa dash in and out but mostly the cherry ride keeps center with a soft yet firm tang. Feel is smooth and firm with about a medium body, warm and tangy with a nice cask creamyness. Unfortunately for me the tang in the finish was a bit much for me to continue on drinking more, it didn�t quite grow on me as much as I had hoped. Still comes across as a solid brew though.
Great Waters Black Forest German Black Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Waters Brewing;"A schwarzbier that�s brewed with ale yeast. I drink from a growler, after witnessing beermatrix gobble up a few pints this afternoon. clear, dark amber coloration, not even nearly black, but I�ll forgive them that, resting under a crown of light tan foam, a good, solid 1/4 "". aroma is soft, smooth, nutty, emitting notes of cocoa, but rather quiet, all told. creamy entry on the palate, so smooth, and, face it, yummy. Nice texture, tingling the tongue, playing with the senses, flavor is sweet, but never too. Lush malt, caramel-y, nearly chocolatey taste shines through, small, but just so hop content. This is a nice one, and it only gets nicer as we go further on in...a fine session brew, rewarding, but easily passed by the lips."
Great Waters Black Forest German Black Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Waters Brewing;Dark red color with a very thin film of foam on top. I thought I couldn�t smell it because of the nearby candle, but nope, no real aroma. The taste was fairly sweet and malty with some bread mixed in the bunch. Watery. Not terrible, but definitely not my favorite from Great Waters.
Great Waters Black Forest German Black Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Waters Brewing;Dark Brown. No Head. Some Dough Bread. Sweet Malt... Hops...Not a Whole Lot of Taste... But a Very Decent Brew.
Great Waters Black Forest German Black Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Waters Brewing;On-tap at the brewpub: Not exactly sure if this would be considered a black ale/schwarzbier or not but its taste seemed as so. Color is a whiskey colored crimson orangey red ruddy brownish thing thats glowing and nearly clear with a fluffy beige cap about a finger high. Some lacing in strings. Aroma is faint but clean and crisp with a soft sour dough bread sweetenss with a touch of floral presense like a fruity blossum of a peach or apple. Flavor is quite yummy, nice and clean, great little tastes of bready sour dough thats fresh and sweet with a lower leveled fruit of raisin, red apple, faintly dipped in caramel residing underneath. Not sure what the malts are here, they seem like it could be black but without a roast quality, more of a bready sweetness really stands out and yummily so. This was quite the taster. Feel is crisp and clean, about medium bodish, nice sweet bready tone with a light fruity touch. This was very inticing to drink down, and it goes down just as easy. A great little drinker. This could be my favorite from the newer bunch of brews at GW! I will be in soon for a growler refill of this stuff!

Rock Bottom Arlington Anniversary Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Arlington;on tap, almost clear with short white head, aroma and flavors are grainy lemons, astringent, some earthiness
Rock Bottom Arlington Anniversary Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Arlington;(Arlington) Cloudy lemon yellow body with white head. Aroma is medium sweet, orange, light coriander. Taste is medium sweet, coriander, some orange peel, light orange. Watery light-medium body with some acidity.
Rock Bottom Arlington Anniversary Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Arlington;Served on tap in a big ol� mug at the brewpub. Light smell of oranges and coriander spiciness with bready and yeasty undertones. Faint whiffs of banana esters come through occasionally. Cloudy pale yellow (akin to a Twinkie) capped by a small layer of foam which remained throughout most of the consumption. No real lacing to speak of. Slightly sour/tart wheaty malts with a splash of lemon and coriander/pepper on the finish. Overly aggressive carbonation kinda hurts the tongue a bit, but keeps it light. Perhaps the keg pressure was too high or something? Easily drinkable and good for sessions. Some off flavors and sensations here and there that prevent this from being frikkin� incredible. Still, this is a nice little wit. The new brewer apparently likes wheat beers so I can�t wait to see if he delves into some of the other sorts in the near future.
Ramapo Valley My Beethoven Maibock;Hilburn, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Aroma of yeast and grains with a hint of malt. Clear golden color not much head. Sweet taste of grain with a light body. Pleasant taste with a sweet grainy finish.

Ramapo Valley My Beethoven Maibock;Hilburn, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Shared at an Ale Atlanta tasting: Pours a clear copper golden with a thin whispy white head. Sweet caramel malty aroma has a good bocky lager yeast character. Starts rich, malty and sweet with some toffee and a semi-dry finish. A nicely balanced and enjoyable maibock.
Ramapo Valley My Beethoven Maibock;Hilburn, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Pours a clear amber color. Aroma of apple juice and malt and a touch of alcohol underneath. Caramel and fruity flavor with a light body and light bitterness on the finish.
Ramapo Valley My Beethoven Maibock;Hilburn, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Pours gold to amber in color. Lightly malty and fruity in both the aroma and flavor. Definitely some apple in the flavor as well. Could have used more hops in the finish. Overall, a pretty good Maibock. Had this one as part of a group tasting, and wish I had more.
Ramapo Valley My Beethoven Maibock;Hilburn, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Once again I have to thank Secret Santa DocLock for this world-class brew! It is, I am assuming, a year old, but has aged very well. Sweet malt aroma mixed with apples and pears. Looks tasty, deep golden/auburn in color. Taste explodes with matly sweetness, but does not overwhelm. Rich and crisp and a quick, slightly sour finish. I wish I knew this was 8% before I guzzled it. Thanks again DocLock.
Ramapo Valley My Beethoven Maibock;Hilburn, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Ramapo Valley Brewery;The hits just keep on coming from lmgraz1, as a very sweet, malty aroma comes off of a stunning reddish hue, with a nice cream colored head. Flavor is mild malty taste, and I get hints of apples, both in the aroma and the taste. A very smooth aftertaste makes this a beer that I drank without putting the glass down, then wished I had another bottle.
Ramapo Valley My Beethoven Maibock;Hilburn, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Bottle provided by DocLock, thanks!!! The beer pours to a nice golden amber hue with a small head which dies but there is a oily quality which coast the glassware and that is a nice thing. The nose has some heavy phenols but you can still detect large esters of green and red apple, pear, caramel corn, wildflowers, and honeycomb. NICE! The taste starts quite sweet with an almost abbey triple type of candi sugar note, but then the fruity and bitter overtones clean the palate nicely. The finish has some alcohol bite but it never interferes with the taste. A tannin/woody dryness is a bit of a shock (again this is a good thing) on the finish as well. The feel has some bite overall and is oily has expected. Wow, this is surprise and one I fully enjoyed. Recommended.
Ramapo Valley My Beethoven Maibock;Hilburn, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Ramapo Valley Brewery;A little mild, poured a nice copper color with white head sans laciing. At first the taste was mild and malty with no hops but the flavors became more pronounced as ifinished the bottle but still too light for me. A good feeling on the toung ethough. all in all an okay effort.
Ramapo Valley My Beethoven Maibock;Hilburn, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Bottle, aged 3 months in the RVB cellars. Pours copper w/ a big, creamy white head. Fabulous aroma of malt, hops, fruit including pears, white grapes, green apples, amd Niagara wine. Tastes malty, with tons of fruit including pears, apples, even berries. Palate is medium, firm, smooth, ever-so-slightly acidic. This is an awesome beer, and you should go get some.
Northwest's Best Puget Sound Gold Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);This is Matt A�s girlfriend. Many of you may think that I do not exist, but I do. Overall, this beer didn�t taste very good. This may be due to the fact that I just brushed my teeth with �Colgate Scope plus Whitening for Sensitive Teeth�. Having said that, my toothpaste is more satisfying than this stupid beer. I also noted that this beer has the appearance of cloudy pee-like when you don�t drink a lot of water to flush your kidney�s out. Cheers! Andrea W. -hahaha -Nice, Andrea! I on the other hand did enjoy the beer. There was a biscuity maltyness followed by a crisp and clean dose of hops. A very nice session beer indeed!
Northwest's Best Puget Sound Gold Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);out of the bottle. pours a golden hue. minimal white head. smells of honey and mild hops. tastes of grain, honey, lemon and brown sugar. slight bitterness towards the end. a bit weak overall but a nice weak flavor at that.
Northwest's Best Puget Sound Gold Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);12 oz bottle. Hey Rating number 10. It can now be added to the top 50....0.........0! Well, it will now have a percentile rating anyway. Aromas of mostly lemon. The flavor was mostly lemon but turned to vanilla and metal as it warmed. Not very exciting at all.
Northwest's Best Puget Sound Gold Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);(12 oz bottle: Trader Joe�s in San Diego/Hillcrest, CA) Found this while digging in the singles barrel, so there�s no telling how long this sat in there. Then again, on the flip side, it was shielded from the fluorescent lighting by the beers piled on top. The beer smells floral and sweet, so I have a feeling this isn�t going to be my type of beer. However, much to my surprise, the flavor isn�t half bad. It�s floral, grapefruity, hoppy and moderately bitter, though the maltiness is light enough to not be much of a factor here, providing just a touch of sweetness. Unfortunately, what is dragging the beer down a bit is a modest soapiness in the background of both the aroma and flavor. Body is light-medium, but the palate is crisp and refreshing. Light golden color and somewhat hazy, the beer is capped by a tall whitish head that slowly settles to a filmy layer and leaves large patches of lace on the glass. Frankly, this is far more flavorful than I expected from a cheap beer at Trader Joe�s, and shows considerably more hoppiness than most golden ales I�ve tried. If it didn�t have the mild soapiness, I would rather enjoy this beer.
Northwest's Best Puget Sound Gold Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottle. Golden color with a huge foamy white head. A dusty light citrus aroma with a smooth bright golden honey and light malt flavor. Refreshing and smooth but without distinction.
Northwest's Best Puget Sound Gold Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Yep it�s a golden colored ale, nose is very faint, perhaps fruity. Medium bodied, honey with malt, apple and citrus with a touch of hops on the back end. Well balanced, drinkable and not very bold, has a place on a hot day and would make a good transition beer.
Northwest's Best Puget Sound Gold Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottle. Pours golden apricot color, hazy with a moderate white head that diminished quickly. Light fruit and floral notes, honey and hints of orange in the aroma. Nice malt flavor, again some orange notes with floral hops and a bitter / acidic finish. Light body and moderate carbonation. Not bad, but overall, pretty unremarkable.
Northwest's Best Puget Sound Gold Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Medium yellow gold color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet, with a touch of grass. A medium bodied gold/blonde ale. Malts are fruity and sweet, touch of orange rind. Hops are slightly bitter, touch of grapefruit and pine. Nicely balanced. A bit more hoppyness than one would expect from a blond ale, but I like hops so� Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Northwest's Best Puget Sound Gold Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottle. Amber beer with a small white head. Caramel malt aroma with some citrus hops. Citrus hop flavor balanced with the malt. A bit of grassiness.
Northwest's Best Puget Sound Gold Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Pours a golden orange color. Aroma is quite sweet. Some hops are present. There is also a bit of a berry like tartness. Flavor is sort of like a hoppy/woody sort of a thing. Fairly bitter. A bit of a grainy finish. Overall not too bad. Only .85 cents a bottle at Trader Joe�s.
Houston Champion;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Houston;First tasted this in the Hogshead, Paisley in May 2000. Cask, handpump dispense. Crystal clear pale straw in colour with a thin white head. Zesty grapefruit peel in the short aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a juicy fruit base of grapefruit and shebert lemon long in intensity. Dusty dry hops give a clean citric bite to the aftertaste. Finish is clean and refreshing with pithy grapefruit to the fore. An ideal summer session Golden Ale but very alike to Peters Well though.

Houston Jock Frost;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Houston;First tasted this in Gabriels, Paisley in February 1999. Cask, handpump dispense. Crystal clear pale straw in colour with a thin white head. Strong lemon peel note evident in the intense fruity aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing throughout. Pale malt gives a slight digestive biscuit note but this is soon lost to the tart citric notes of grapefruit and lemon zest which rapidly build up. Astringent dusty hop resins give a very dry aftertaste. Finish is again dry with hop resins and oak cask very much in evidence in the dessication process. Not one of my favourites for Winter.
Houston Jock Frost;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Houston;On cask at Cloisters. Pours a golden colour with a decent white head. Aroma of musty yeast, caramel and hay. Similar flavours with a little lemon to finish. Moderate carbonation and a foamy mouth-feel.
Houston Jock Frost;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Houston;Re-rate @ Steam Packet, Isle of Whithorn. Pours amber with a decent head. The nose has malt and grapes. The taste has biscuits and sultanas. The palate is medium in structure and texture and there is a clean finish. Overall, a great improvement since this pub seems to be able to keep its ales well. Previous rating 30/12/11 5+3+4+2+7 = 2.1 On cask at Bert�s Bar, Edinburgh. Pours golden with a slim head. The nose has soggy Frosties and a mild yeast aroma. The taste is green apple and hay which makes me think it has gone off. The palate is medium bodied and medium textured with a burnt astringent finish. Overall, not good at all but I don�t think this is how the brewer wanted it to taste, so it deserves another try in the future.
Houston Jock Frost;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Houston;Cask at Tiles, Edinburgh. Malty, a hint of yeast. Fine and sublte bitter finish. Nothing amazing about this, and nothing seasonal, either. An honest bitter.

Arbor Brasserie Greff Grand Cru;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;750ml. bottle at the Arbor Brewing Company Pub & Eatery. Poured a small off-white head, no lacing, uncarbonated, cloudy, and an orange red hue. Aroma was malty and mild alcohol notes. Flavor was not good for this style of beer-sour and hoppy. Unimpressive. Tingly mouthfeel. Medium bodied.
Arbor Brasserie Greff Grand Cru;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;This draft brew from the brewery poured a medium sized head of finely sized mostly diminishing white colored bubbles that left behind a poor lacing. The body contained no carbonation, was transparent and light orange brown in color. Its aroma contained notes of weird malts . Its mouth feel is bubbly initially tingly with a tingly palate. Its flavor contained strange malt hop notes and was not very good. not a Grand Cru per style IMHO.
Arbor Brasserie Greff Grand Cru;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Tart, apple pia aroma with a hint of cheddar. A ton of yeast and grassy notes as well. Spritzy nose. Musty lemon juice and leather shoes. Cherry and mulberry notes as well. Not enough malt. Light-bodied when compared to others in the style.
Arbor Brasserie Greff Grand Cru;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Explosive cork removal. Burnished apricot. Creamy, patchy white head with plenty of pastiness. Assertive notes of musty air mixed with grassy herbs, phenolic esters, lemongrass, and plaster. Hint of nutty yeast. Quite vinous, to boot. Delicate, but lively, on the palate with a feathery spritz to the carbonation. Opens gently tart with gassy carbonation. Firm, musty mineral flavors interwoven with a brisk leafy hop edge. Chalky yeast and zippy carbonation contribute more firmness to the body. Dry finish of sour apple skins and a delayed caramelized malt emergence with fresh dates, toasted dough, and fig leaf subtleties. Phenolic belches ensue as bready malt whispers linger. Phenomenal picnic brew, as it�s perfectly tart and quenching, yet with an artisanal element to hold your attention throughout the bottle. Impressive.
Rock Head Malt Liquor;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Minhas Craft Brewery;Doesn�t hit as hard I as expected but very drinkable for an 11% malt liquor (if you�re into high gravity malt liquors, but if you�re not, buy it as a gag gift). Purchased in Hudson, WI.
Rock Head Malt Liquor;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Minhas Craft Brewery;This bottled malt liquor poured a small sized head of frothy large sized mostly diminishing white colored bubbles that left behind a fair lacing.

Hi Test Malt Liquor;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Minhas Craft Brewery;"""Beer #3 in the 40oz. head to head taste off. it sucks and that�s all you got to know but I guess here are some reasons it sucks. For one what the hell is �pure artesian water� is this water painters use to clean out there solvent cans with? This tasted almost exactly like all the other 40oz strong lagers we sampled tonight (corn, rice, sweet, chemical) except the had more apple flavoring to it. Crap still to more to get through this was the worst idea ever."""
Hi Test Malt Liquor;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Minhas Craft Brewery;"I don�t understand. The label on the bottle, purchased just yesterday in Highland, Indiana, says it�s ""Craft Brewed"". Surely they didn�t mean for it to taste like this. After smelling the gentle malt and corn syrup sweetness, I was assailed by tastes of grass and a cloyingly sweet syrup and burning tin. The metallic aftertaste won�t leave my mouth or nose. Surely the bottle must have gone bad. I mean, it is clear and all... Liquor Stop, Highland, IN"
Hi Test Malt Liquor;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Minhas Craft Brewery;OKBeer. I don�t know when you drank this, but the fact it could have tasted so foul is the fact that Huber stopped producing this over 8 years ago. At the time however, it was a good malt. Got ya drunk real fast. Too bad they don�t sell it anymore.
Hi Test Malt Liquor;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Minhas Craft Brewery;355 ml can. Labelled as Perfect 10 for Mountain Crest Liquors. Dark golden colour with a fully diminishing fizzy and frothy white head. Weird particles floating around throughout. Corn and vegetal aroma with some nasty alcohol lurking in the background. Cidery, fusel alcohol, and corn flavours. Light bodied, oily and greasy mouthfeel.
Turtle Mountain Java Junction Porter;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Nitro head on top of a black beer. Aromas of coffee,...that�s about it, some roasted grains but its hard to tell. Definitely a porter and not a stout, they�re isn�t the stout roastiness that you find in some of America�s so-called porters. Very smooth and just a wallop of coffee. After drinking this I felt like I had consumed a whole pot of coffee. You really have to like Java to like this.
Felstar Summer Knight;Dunmow, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felstar;5th July 2017 Chelmsford Beer Festival. Cask. As �Summer Night� 3.8%. Almost clear deep amber beer, small pale tan head. Palate is smooth and semi dry, decent fine carbonation. Some bitterish toffee in the thin malts. Light malt cream. Pronounced berry fruits, so much so I asked the brewer if fruit had been added but he said not. Cherry and strawberry and others! Light crispy finish. Pretty tasty bitter.
Felstar Summer Knight;Dunmow, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felstar;Chappel Fest. Just managed to nip into the Chappel Fest on the last day when most of the beer was running out. Condition of all the beers sampled was very good, and the location seemed even prettier than last year. Even though the Restoration Shed had over 80% of the beers finished, I still managed to get five scoops, including this rather tasty summer session bitter. Pale orange colour. Apple flavours. Dry yet rather creamy. Fresh and delicate.
Viper Ales Hiss Taker;Ingatestone, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Viper Ales;Chappel Fest. Light orange. A fruity best bitter. Soft and tasty, leading to a gentle dry dusty finish.

Holts Humdinger (Bottle);Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Joseph Holt;Bottle. Dark honey (apt!) with a very light haze - thick white head. There�s a lovely whiff of honey in the nose mixed in with citrus fruits and a light peach. In the mouth and it�s like someone has drizzled honey over a fruit cocktail and soaked it in bitter. Surprisingly yummy with a nice amount of carbonation to keep the flavour fizzing through the long palate.
Sconnie Badger Brown Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;William Kuether Brewing;2004 Autumn Brew Review: Probably Their Best Offering at The Review. Brown Coloring. Small Head. Good Malt and Nutty Taste. Little Sweet. Overall Not Bad.
Sconnie Badger Brown Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;William Kuether Brewing;Autumn Brew Review 2004. Good brown color with a little head. Mild nut aroma. A bit of malt taste. Kind of sweet. By far their best beer, although in my opinion, that�s not saying much.
Sconnie Badger Brown Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;William Kuether Brewing;When I was adding this beer, I saw this pub was established this year. They are but wee infants. Very cool! For youngsters, they make darn tasty beer, and the Badger brown (Badger Badger Badger) is no exception. Beautiful color. Sweeter then most browns, but that�s part of the appeal.
Old Hat Hefe Weizen;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Old Hat Brewery;Draft sample at Old Hat.

Medium sweet flavor with a solid sweet wheat finish of moderate duration. Good refreshing brew.
Old Hat Hefe Weizen;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Old Hat Brewery;(Sampled 7-9-08 at brewery) Turbid orange-yellow in appearance, a large aroma of lemons and wheat with clove and bananas hanging around in the background. Hits the mouth with a low-medium body, the malt is vey light on the tongue, esters make their transistions almost perfectly, finish has a nice fading feel to it.
Old Hat Hefe Weizen;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Old Hat Brewery;Draft taster at Old Hat. Rating #984! The menu card says this has 50% wheat malt and mentions the usual banana and clove flavor. And yes, that�s definitely here. Tastewise, though, it�s got a bit of graininess that I happened to find a refreshing break, that helps it break through the many versions of this style. This much wheat also suggests to me a slight sour or acid taste, like a bit of Berliner is hiding inside. Then a bit of a winey finish. Very nice.
Old Hat Hefe Weizen;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Old Hat Brewery;Sampled at Great Taste of the Midwest. Average looking beer, but very tasty.

Big Bear Oktobearfest;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Big Bear Brewing Company;Poured up on tap at the brewpub a brilliant deep copper with off white head. The mild aroma carries malt sweetness mixed with even milder caramel and vague dark fruitiness. The taste begins roasty and then moves toward caramel and maltiness. Toward midway dark fruity esters show up and over take the flavor with cherries, plums, raisins and sweet red apples. It seems to pick up mild spices midway and to the finish as well.
Big Bear Oktobearfest;Coral Springs, Florida, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Big Bear Brewing Company;Draft� Clear amber lager with a mid-sized, creamy, white head. Excellent retention. Served way too cold, the aroma was quite restrained. As it warmed, toasted and caramel notes came forth. Medium-bodied with tingly carbonation. Sweet, caramely flavor with nutty, biscuity undertones. Crisp, lightly bitter finish. Hearty, but also nice and refreshing.

Stringy lacing on the glass. Aroma of grassy hops, malt and fruit. Light to medium body with flavors of mild hops, doughy malt and a bit of fruit.

The Brew Kettle K�lsch;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;The Brew Kettle;22 oz Bottle that I can only assume was bottled in 2005. Pours a very good-looking golden brown with a wispy lite white head. Slow and med. size bubbles. The aroma has malt, and leather and (sadly) a bit of rubbing alcohol (actually the only thing I found offensive about this brew). As for the taste, leather comes to mind, as does lite wood and hops. The body is somewhat watery with a dryish finish. I know this description is not very appealing but the beer is OK. While I was not that impressed, I drank the whole bottle and I would not turn it down if given in the future.
The Brew Kettle K�lsch;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;The Brew Kettle;Dark golden color (surprised, I thought it would be a lighter color), medium sized head, pretty good lacing. Aroma was malty and lightly sweet. Taste is bready malts, some fruityness, medium bodied, light bitterness is always in the background.
The Brew Kettle K�lsch;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;The Brew Kettle;Bottle: Deep gold body w/ a short lived white head. Sanitizer predominates! Very light malt comes in second, then a stronger fruitiness. Sanitizer still very apparent in the flavor, light fruitiness, well balanced. Highly carbonated, smooth! Not a very good Koelsh IMHO, but not a horrible beer! Bland, boring, but better than BMC crap, even with santizer!
Harvest Moon Vanilla Porter;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Porter;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);Sample at the Garden State Brewers Fest.

Red Oak St. Georges Bock;Whitsett, North Carolina, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Red Oak Brewery;This was an excellent and hoppy Maibock from this brewery. Came out a nice pale and hazy golden color. Nose was spicy like cracked rye and spicy like lager yeast.

Kemptown Dolphin Bitter;Brighton, East Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Kemptown Brewery;[Cask at The Hand in Hand, Brighton] An orange beer with no head. The aroma is primarily sweet, while the flavor besides being sweet has notes of caramel.
Kemptown Dolphin Bitter;Brighton, East Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Kemptown Brewery;Cask@The Hand in Hand, Brighton. Fairly typical bitter. Its a summer ale, but there wasn�t anything particualrly summery about it, except for the fact that it was quite light. Pretty easy going, with the typical dry malts and lightly citric hops of most standard English bitters, this is even lighter than most however, and was a bit boring.
Gold Coast Draught;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Coast Brewery;No head, and no carbonation. Mid brown colour, clear. Aroma of an average extract homebrew, but I know that it is made with grains, some hoppiness. Thin and watery flavours, leaning towards the hoppy end of the scale, or maybe the lack of body coming through.
Gold Coast Draught;Sanctuary Cove, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Coast Brewery;Tawny orange brown body with a compact head. Taste was slightly metallic and a touch of caramel. Not a lot of body but a reasonable finish. Reminds me of an English Bitter - a good session beer.

The head was thin, consisting predominantly of soap bubbles. Smelled of brown sugar, molasses, and dried dates. Full bodied, smooth, and sweet with lowish carbonation. The flavor was malt-dominated and included the likes of molasses, brown sugar, toffee, and dark fruits. There was also a bit of booze and some subdued grass.

I have to give big thanks to the guys at Fitgers for comping this after I gave them a couple of six packs of Hangar beers, big thanks.
Fitgers Ole Redbeard Barley Wine;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Fitgers Brewhouse;Winterfest 2009 - �07 version. Pours a dark brown. The nose of dried cherries, cranberries and dates at first. Quite earthy. Comes across the palate heavy on oak and peat in a dark honey. The finish is fruity alcohol with a bitter grapefruit juice burst. Palate is noticeably thin.
Fitgers Ole Redbeard Barley Wine;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Fitgers Brewhouse;Shadowy and dark oak brown. Aroma of dried cherries, cranberries and dates at first. Very earthy. Maple syrup and wild rice take this in a new direction which anticipates the flavor quite nicely. Heavy with wet oak and peat, glazed in a dark honey. A hot singe of plastic, fruity alcohol at the finish with a bitter grapefruit juice burst. Palate is noticeably thin, highlighting the fire accidentally. Lacks sufficient malt strength to combat this, or to provide a substantial foundation. Quite loose around the edges and a bit underdone.
Fitgers Ole Redbeard Barley Wine;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Fitgers Brewhouse;Sample at pub. Brown/orange with a thin head. Aroma and taste of sugar, alchohol, a bit of fruits. A bit sweet for my taste.
Fitgers Ole Redbeard Barley Wine;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Fitgers Brewhouse;2005 Barley Wine, tasted in June 2007. Hazy brown, chestnut, red-peach colors.

Fitgers Ole Redbeard Barley Wine;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Fitgers Brewhouse;2005 aged version. A sweet and alcoholic barleywine. Some fruit in the aroma. Lots of sugar in the flavor. Hops come out in the finish and they are dry and bitter.
Dieu du Ciel! 6e Soir;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Delicious brew. The pour is a bright and vibrant glowing orange with a bright finger of white head. The nose is funky....with a good dose of barnyard funk, hay, acetic notes and juicy fruits. The mid palate is sweet, toasty and fruity with light funky notes and light bitterness. The finish is a bit bitter with a warm booziness. Overall a nice brew.
Central Coast Topless Blonde;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Central Coast Brewing;Had a taste on tap at the brewery. Delicious and refreshing, but reminds me a bit of a lager.
Central Coast Topless Blonde;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Central Coast Brewing;Draft @ the brewery. Pours a pale golden color with a small white head. Has a fruity malty weak hoppy aroma. Fruity malty grainy flavor. has a fruity malty grainy finish with weak hoppy hints.
Central Coast Topless Blonde;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Central Coast Brewing;Pale golden pour with a white head. The nose is strangely acidic. Sweet grain, some bread, yeast, and light floral hops. Weird grape and apple aroma and sweetness, too. The flavor is a lot heavier on the grape and apple. Some grainy sweetness, bread, yeast, and floral hops. Green apple skin, water, and grass on the finish.
Central Coast Topless Blonde;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Central Coast Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Great little place. Pale light hazy amber yellow. Hay and high citrus. Nice summer brew. Tart yeasty bite. Good beer.
Central Coast Topless Blonde;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Central Coast Brewing;Draught at the brewery. Lightly hazy yellow with a small head. Clean aroma and flavor with light crackery malt and spicy hop balance. Very drinkable overall. Nicely done blond ale that takes a model that is hard to make interesting and makes something I would gladly order another of.
Central Coast Topless Blonde;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Central Coast Brewing;Pretty bland golden ale. The only thing that set this apart is it�s sweetness. Lots of residual sugar leftover this beer. I didn�t care for the sweet flavor. Drink too much and you�ll definitely have a headache the next day.
Central Coast Topless Blonde;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Central Coast Brewing;as enniskillen said.pretty bland,a bit light.a bit of hops,and abit of wheat.not to good.
Central Coast Topless Blonde;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Central Coast Brewing;Typical White. Bland, plain, one sided, unbalanced beer. Heavy wheat with some vanilla, and unbalanced hops. Not super horrible, but not pleasant.
Indian Wells Orange Blossom Amber;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;Bottle at home. Pours hazy orange with a medium, frothy white head, long retention with good lacing. Aroma is orange soda and corny Pils malt. Flavor is corny Pils malt, orange peel, lightly bitter and a dry finish. Light body and moderate carbonation.
Indian Wells Orange Blossom Amber;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;12oz bottle shared with my wife on 25th May 2016, straight after this breweries Raspberry Ale: preferred this, but only just. Dull orange in colour with a wisp and collar on top. Oranges rule the nose and flavour (no surprises there then) and it is quite refreshing in the afternoon Californian sunshine. On the sweet side, but just about drinkable when thirsty.
Indian Wells Orange Blossom Amber;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;Bottle. Yellow orange pour, with a white head. Smells and tastes like orange soda, sweet, and artificial orange. Not much else going on here, I would not drink this.
Indian Wells Orange Blossom Amber;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;"""ok on a 100 degree day, no more, no less. a nice orange peel aroma gives way to less pleasing smells as it warms, no complexity whatsoever, and not very good if not ice cold. this orange ""amber"" is orange atop a straw beer, so i�m not sure where the amber part comes in..."""
Indian Wells Orange Blossom Amber;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured an orange color with a medium sized foamy orange-white head that left decent lacing. The aroma was Tang. The flavor was Tangy. Medium length finish. Light body. Pretty awful.
Indian Wells Orange Blossom Amber;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;Like a dry mimosa more than a beer. Floral citrus nose followed by a ripe orange peel sweetness.
Indian Wells Orange Blossom Amber;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;Adding orange peel to an American lager can�t hurt but I�m not sure it really helps either.
Indian Wells Orange Blossom Amber;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;12oz bottle pours an innocent clear copper with thin white head. The aroma pulses with Sunkist Orange soda notes along with a thin ring of powdered sugar. The taste punishes the wary with sugary Sunkist Orange soda like notes that are fully enhanced by the above average level of carbonation. I succumbed and poured most of it down the drain. This is likely a good beer for people who are convinced they hate beer due to its beer-y flavors.
Indian Wells Orange Blossom Amber;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;Bottle. Pours a cloudy yellow gold with a frothy white head. The aroma is fruit and cereal. Thin mouthfeel with a sour orange and tart. Not much going on with this one.
Indian Wells Orange Blossom Amber;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;Thanks to swalden28 for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a slightly hazy orange color with a white head. The aroma smells like Sunkiss soda with some grain mixed in. The flavor is just as bad, with a lot of sweet orange and biscuit malt notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.
Indian Wells Mojave Oktoberfest;Inyokern, California, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Indian Wells Brewing;Draught at the brewery. Pours clear orange with a medium, frothy off-white head, medium retention with light lacing. Aroma is toast malt with light earthy hops. Flavor is moderate toast malt, sweet grainy malt, light earthy hops and bitterness with a dry finish. Medium body and carbonation.
Indian Wells Mojave Oktoberfest;Inyokern, California, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Indian Wells Brewing;"Not expecting much, and it delivered in that regard. Thin, fizzy and boring. It�s a little bready and sweet but not at all rich like I enjoy in the style. Meh... Earlier Rating: 10/7/2014 Total Score: 2.2 their best of 8 in the sampler by far. still nothing i�d ever buy again. non-offensive is the key here.kit quality malts, still no head, sweet, with little complexity but nothing to hate. the only beer of 8 that wasn�t drainpoured!"""
Indian Wells Mojave Oktoberfest;Inyokern, California, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Indian Wells Brewing;This worked for us. We don�t drink a lot of Marzens, but this was a nice find for up I the foothills of CA.
Indian Wells Mojave Oktoberfest;Inyokern, California, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Indian Wells Brewing;Overall not a bad experience with this beer. A bit sweet on the taste and the aftertaste leaves a dry but not terrible palate. Pour is a nice amber with a lingering head.
Indian Wells Mojave Oktoberfest;Inyokern, California, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Indian Wells Brewing;22 oz bottle as Indian Wells Oktoberfest Lager. (Albertsons) Ridgecrest, CA. Clear amber colour with a tiny white head. Sweet fruitiness, malt and some hoppy notes in a sweet aroma. The flavour is sweet fruits, fruit jam, mild fruity hops and some malt. Very fruity and sweet. M�rzen? I don�t know...
Indian Wells Mojave Oktoberfest;Inyokern, California, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Indian Wells Brewing;22 oz. bomber from La Vista Liquor. Pours orange amber with a decent white head that leaves slight lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, grass, hay, slight earth. Has a nice balance of sweet and bitter but has a very run of the mill aroma and taste. I would say this is an average Marzen, nothing to get excited about and not worth $6 for the bottle. Has a sharp, dry grassiness to the flavor, with a dry finish. Could be used as a session lager. Maybe I�m just not too crazy about this style.
Indian Wells Mojave Oktoberfest;Inyokern, California, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Indian Wells Brewing;Pours a light copper color with a very faint toffee aroma. Taste is very bland, watery, with no distinct flavor. I�m not impressed with this beer at all, very underwhelming.
Indian Wells Mojave Oktoberfest;Inyokern, California, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Indian Wells Brewing;Bottle from KNB: Aroma is mild with a medium scent of sweet caramel malts. The appearance was a light amber hue with a short lived head that quickly fizzed out. The beer is typical of an Oktoberfest in flavor with moderate malt character with just the proper bitterness stemming from German hops. Okay Marzen style beer and like the fact they reached distribution to San Diego. Well done and well played Indian Wells Brewing.
Indian Wells Mojave Oktoberfest;Inyokern, California, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Indian Wells Brewing;Bottle from bhensonb. Pours cloudy copper with a short off-white head and a toffee aroma. There is a weak red malt flavor with a dry finish.
Indian Wells Mojave Oktoberfest;Inyokern, California, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Indian Wells Brewing;Bomber in Santa Barbara. 5% by style? You guys are pretty harsh on this one! Deep amber pour, nice fluffy white head, malt forward, sweet and fruity, totally enjoyable.
Mighty Oak Line Dancer;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask at White Hart, Margaretting Tye. Part of their winter beer festival. Dark gold. A robust beer with lots of flavour and the alcohol is quite obvious. The bitter finish is a little sharp and rough which lets it down slightly.
Mighty Oak Line Dancer;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Bullion gold, absolutely in first class condition. Hoppy, sex in a glass. Really silky and smooth and delivery a kick between the eyes if that�s what you like. Mighty Oak is a top brewery and I�d strongly urge anyone that has the chance to try their beer.
Mighty Oak Line Dancer;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Bright bottled at Chappel Fest. A fresh, tasty orange marmalade bitter with a beautiful flowery fragrance and a lingering orange dust finish.

Farmers Ales Puck's Folly;Maldon, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Farmers Ales (Maldon Brewing);Bottle from Poplar Nurseries Farm Shop, near Colchester. Deep gold with a large craggy white head and slightly too much carbonation. Vanilla, lemon, a touch of spice and a middling bitterness. Not bad.
Farmers Ales Puck's Folly;Maldon, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Farmers Ales (Maldon Brewing);Not going to faff about with BS descriptors but if you like a light hoppy ale then this one of the best I have tasted.
Farmers Ales Puck's Folly;Maldon, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Farmers Ales (Maldon Brewing);Cask at the 10th Colchester Winter Beer Festival. Pours clear bright light golden with a small bubbly white head. Aroma of caramel, light fruit and hop. Light to medium sweetness and medium bitterness. Light body and slightly oily texture, carbonation is soft. Very nice.
Farmers Ales Puck's Folly;Maldon, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Farmers Ales (Maldon Brewing);Draught (Orange Tree, Chelmsford) Sweet, a bit wooly, aroma. Pale straw. Some wooly aspects in the taste too. Finish wooly too. Ah, whatever, it may have not been intended to be like that, but I liked the wool.
Farmers Ales Puck's Folly;Maldon, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Farmers Ales (Maldon Brewing);Cask at Fat Cat, Colchester. It pours clear golden with a small white head. The aroma is simple, straw, mild sweetness, stone fruit, apricot and persimmon. The taste is crisp, restrained bitterness, straw, apricot, persimmon and pale malt with a dry finish. Light body and limited carbonation. Classic low hop, malt - forward gold... So lacks some flavour.
Farmers Ales Puck's Folly;Maldon, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Farmers Ales (Maldon Brewing);500ml bottle. Minimally cloudy, yellow-ish, pale golden colour with average, thick, frothy, fairly lasting, minimally lacing, snow-white head. (Asian) spicy and citrusy hoppy aroma, hints of lemon, lemongrass, and - strangely enough - yellow curry, and plum wine, a touch of brett. Taste is somehow diluted bretty, hints of hay and apricot. Very unusual, if intentional.
Farmers Ales Puck's Folly;Maldon, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Farmers Ales (Maldon Brewing);Cask at The Ale House, Colchester. Poured a crystal clear light amber with a bubbly white head. The aroma is weak malt. The flavour is medium bitter with a malt hop varnish bitter palate and a long bitter finish. Medium bodied with flat carbonation. I�m not sure what hops were used but they took some getting used to!
Farmers Ales Puck's Folly;Maldon, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Farmers Ales (Maldon Brewing);Cask @ Dove, South Hackney E8. Pours a clear golden color with a white head. Has a fruity malty weak hoppy aroma. Fruity malty caramel hoppy flavor. Has a fruity malty caramel hoppy finish.

Jurand Dri Beer Orange and Limon;Olsztyn, Poland;Flavored - Fruit;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Almost identical as Redd�s. The same artificial Fanta-like aroma & flavour, very slight malt notes. Again, not horrid as a drink but it�s hard to treat it as a beer.
Jurand Top Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Cornish flavoured. No bitterness into the finish. Vague metallic note. Alcohol presence.
Jurand Top Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Rated with Chmurarz 31.05.2007 Bottle brown,500 ml, extract of wort 13,8 % Tthe look is nice, redish golden body with almost creamy head, aroma is acidic and kind of rich, alcoholic, but the flavour is dry and dusty, rowan berry, juniper berry, TOP MOCNE�s dryness is very disturbing though, lack hop and balance, very rough and jaggy
Jurand Top Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;i agree with my predecessors-in-drinkin� that the look is nice, redish golden body with almost creamy head, aroma is acidic and kind of rich, I can even say that it reminds specific top-fermented beer aroma, alcoholic, but the flavour is dry and dusty, rowanberry, juniper berry, brew is all in all rather poor but not as poor as Mr D from Krakow described, he must have gotten an old bottle(just like I did with SZPUNT MOCNE, which was surprisingly good the first time but none of later tasings confirmed the first impression) TOP MOCNE�s dryness is very disturming though, lack hop and balance, very rough and jaggy
Jurand Top Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;"The best thing about this beer is its nice look, with big and foamy head. Awful, dirty aroma - the beer just stinks. Taste is dusty, or maybe even sandy; almost no bitterness. Not impressive, even in Polish strong lager standards."
Jurand Top Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Bottled (labelled Top Mocne). Golden colour, firm head. Dusty cereal aroma. Fruity and dry with medium bitterness. The remaining impression however is - dusty...
Butts Traditional;Great Shefford, Berkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Butts Brewery;Third, gravicask, at the 22nd Oxford Beer & Cider Festival. Shared with Finn. Film-type layer, covering white head, lacing rings down the glass. Moderate malt-fruity nose, mid-sweet. Mixed taste of grass and mid-sweet caramel malts. Malt-fruity ending, bittersweet. Accepted. (25.10.2019).
Sconnie Rustic Trail Amber Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;William Kuether Brewing;Reviewed from a 12 ounce bottle, it pours a clear copper color, absolutely no head or fizz. Looks completely flat. Pleasant but mild sweet malt in the aroma. I like the flavor. Sweet caramel malt balances nicely with a tangy/spicy hop. I like the hoppy aftertaste too. It has *some* carbonation, but not enough. This could pass for an alt if only it had carbonation... I�ve had this beer on tap at two beer festivals - the Saintoberfest at St Paul�s Midway Stadium, and the Clayton (WI) Lions Club beer festival. It was really good both times. Much much better carbonation on tap.
Sconnie Rustic Trail Amber Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;William Kuether Brewing;Pleasant old-time malty aroma. Appearance is very flat and has a medium-copper tint. A flat appearance might be ok with an altbier, but the flavor falls flat as well and is associated with an inert-syrup weak mouthfeel, throwing out a edge to the brew of, of all things, _sauerkraut_, that is balanced only by the intensity of the malts used. Overall, this is a beer with potential based in high-quality raw ingredients but at this point it needs a lot of work.
Sconnie Rustic Trail Amber Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;William Kuether Brewing;12 oz bottle: Clear dark copper color with no head or carbonation present. Nothin�? Good color though. Aroma has a fairly nice roasty grain to it, husky, a bit of cardboard and cooked corn notes take away from the overall. Taste is not good, very raw roastyness thats uneven and has a strange burntness of husks and popcorn that just lingers with an unpleasing tone and flavor. It has an old bread and charred nuttyness that doesn�t sit well at all. Unwelcome notes of tin or coin are laced about as well. Feel is thin with a dusty/chalky middle, tannin notes abound, finishes lightly creamier but overall dry and dusty. Practically unfinishable. So many things wrong with this one. I had tried this at the Autumn brew review along with some of the other �sconnie brews and remember not liking any of them, but when I saw the bottles available for single purchase at Ciccone�s I figured it would be worth giving them a second chance. Oh how wrong I was.

Sconnie Rustic Trail Amber Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;William Kuether Brewing;Autumn Brew Review 2004. Orange color with no head. Bland aroma and taste. Slightly bitter. How in the world is this an Alt?
Sconnie Rustic Trail Amber Ale;Clear Lake, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;William Kuether Brewing;An orange beer. Not a lot of aroma or flavor. Some aroma of hops. Taste is bitter. Light body.

Krajan Irlandzkie Mocne;Nak�o nad Noteci�, Poland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Browary Kujawsko Pomorskie Krajan;Draft at Omerta, Krakow. Deep ruby with a tan head. Aroma is amber malt, toasted bread, apple and raspberry jelly, butter. Medium-light bodied, highly sweet with low bitterness, syrupy and gelatinous and sticky mouth feel. The flavor and aftertaste is uniquely horrid (imagine something like cheap store brand berry-flavored jelly, twizzlers candy, raisin flavoring, apple butter, burnt batter) leaving a permanent coating of film in your mouth, a taste awful enough to make you wince and a filmy texture that is impossible to remove, it just lingers forever, no palate cleansing possible, just endlessly slimy-grimy sweet and sour. Grape jelly? Check. Burnt pancake batter? Check? Abusive sweetness? Check. Creeping thoughts that this is Lithuania all over again? Check.

Arbor Brasserie Greff Brune;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Pours a light brown with no head. Aroma of nail polish remover. Taste is malty, sour , really sour. Really acidic, crazy sour.
Arbor Brasserie Greff Brune;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;"""2004 vintage. Thanks to Devin for sharing this. A: brown, mild lacing S: musty, basement, yeast, spices T: oak, wild yeast. The six years of age on this brew added a lot of mustiness and funk. Very complex. M: bold kick in the finish, a bit musty in the feel D: a small sample is all you need. I�d drink this again. It was much different than other Flanders Oud Bruin I�ve had."""
Arbor Brasserie Greff Brune;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;"Bottle at the brewpub. Dark brown pour with a bit of head. Aroma is quite ""sour"", lots of oud bruin aromas coming off: vinegar, brown sugar, cherries (lots of cherries), a bit of a hay aroma coming through there too. Taste is sweet, lots of cherries at first before finishing off very sour and dry. Palate is well carbonated and medium to full bodied. I really enjoyed this unknown."
Arbor Brasserie Greff Brune;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;750ml bottle, labeled as Brasserie Gregg Barrel-Aged Sour Brown Ale. Bottled in April 2009, and aged exactly 2 years in the bottle. The pour gives a hazy, dark, chestnut colored body with an amberish tint around the outer edges and thin spots. Na modest head of smooth, grayish-khaki foam settles to a thin but lasting blanket, leaving behind small, sheety, tissue-thin flares of lacing. The nose is decidedly chocolaty, suggesting of fermenting figs rolled in an aged cocoa powder dusting, hinting also at well attenuated caramel and raisinettes in the malt base. There�s a bit of a lactic feel to the cocoa, nodding at Milk Duds, while notes of wet oak funk provide a sharp, almost vinous tartness. Flavors are decidedly tannic, hinting that the barrel formerly held a red wine. Notes of dry, almost chalky chocolate touch every dark, fruity element within, from fig to plum and raisin (all heavily attenuated, mind you). Soured oak funk is buggy and damp, permeating all else, yet remaining fairly restrained. The palate is medium statured and well carbonated, providing a lively tingle from first sip to last, and showing sufficient dryness and fairly low residual sugar. Still, it is just a tad bit too sticky on the finish for my taste. Overall, I�ll call it a solid brew. It seems a little dirty and unrefined at points, but I�d not refuse another glass. Good stuff.
Arbor Brasserie Greff Brune;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;"April 2009 Bottle Date; Sampled October 2010 The cork was a harder than hell to get out of this bottle, after futilely twisting for a while I had to pull out a cork screw. A solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a fluffy, three-finger thick, pale brown tinged, full tan colored head that leaves thick lacing on the sides of my glass. The beer is a nice, dark brown color. The aroma is quite nice with ample lactic notes backed by a base level earthy funkiness, a rich maltiness and a oak character that becomes more noticeable as the beer warms up. The malt character reminds me of a well browned, complexly whole grain, rustic bread crust. A touch of cherry-like fruitiness mixes with a buttery, ripe cheese note (that leans towards funky), perhaps a touch of sweaty, musky foot-like stench, notes of a rotting, earthy mushroom and maybe even a touch of acetone just barely noticeable at times in the finish. At times the fruitiness in this beer�s nose is quite nice and I really like the rich, darker malt character found in this beer. As the beer warms up it gets a bit fruitier and has a more balanced funkiness and a touch of spicy, nostril warming alcohol becomes noticeable as well. Perhaps a little on the cold side for me (45*F or so), my first sip tastes lightly sweet up front, but much of this is accentuated by the acidity of this beer. The finish has a toasted brown bread crust character to this and a lingering lactic acidity. There is a berry like fruitiness up front that leans towards strawberry at times & makes me think that there is a touch of acetic acid that accentuates this character. The finish has a nice touch of malt to it as well with an almost roasted, definitely toasted, brown malt character to it. This is really nicely tart and, while not super aggressive, it has a solid acidity to it that I can even feel a bit in my pre-dinner belly. A musty earthiness and a touch of plastic like phenolics add some funkiness as does some earthy, woody mushroom notes; the malt and the phenolics combine to produce a hint of an ever so ephemeral smokiness. The body of this beer is quite nice, especially as it warms it has a nice, lush texture to it that is fairly creamy, but it has enough effervescent carbonation to it to keep ti fairly quaffable. A fair amount of oak character plays an important role in this beer; a definite spiciness to the finish, and accentuating woody note as well as a certain buttery-oak quality and perhaps a hint of vanillin are all perceptible here. Really this is just a very nice beer; the combination of malt character with the acidity, softer fruitiness and funkiness makes for a delicious beer and the texture is just about perfect. This is the second time I have had a bottle of this batch (I still haven�t managed to get an intact label from the bottle though), and I wouldn�t mind having a whole lot more of this in my cellar as this is one fantastic experience of a beer."
Arbor Brasserie Greff Brune;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;A decent offering, well worth the money and i�d definitely get it again. Just didn�t knock my socks off. thin, bubbly, acedic, missing other components that are common in style.
Arbor Brasserie Greff Brune;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;750ml bottle. Pours a swampy brown with a small off white ring. Nice semi tart notes of oak, cherries, some candied sugar. Mild on the palate, only slightly tart, nice and crisp.
Arbor Brasserie Greff Brune;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Arbor Greff Brune.. Thanks to Derek for all tho bottles tonight... Pours a dark opaque toffee brown with a thin to medium soapy white head... Light cinnamon and cherry brown nose with an underlying spice note underneath... Flavors of earthy mineral sour cherry with a oud bruin bent. Liked this arbor more so than the others outside of the overly acidic reserve. 8/4/7/3/14
Town Hall Old Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Old Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Sometimes called English Old Ale, in some other places Olde Ale, and in this case it can be known as French Cabernet Barrel-Aged Old Ale. Sampled in a non-aged version at a fest, then several times at the anniversary party. At the moment, I sip from out of a growler. Dusky crimson hue, shining light at the bottom, dark at the top, nestled under a thin, but lasting layer of foam. Heavenly aroma, absolutely divine. A challenge to pin this down or pick it apart, for it seems seamless, no element bolder than the others, emerging as an ethereal whole. Fruit is first, of course, bright, but mellow, sweet, but subtle. Grape and cherry, jammy, yet smooth, lightly spicy, with gentle alcoholic notes, as well. Uplifting on the lips, soothing, warm, melts the mouth, and relaxes the soul. Full flavor, big fruit, but not too overpowering, spreads around the palate, tingles the tastebuds, with a slight tang, a blast of juiciness, a sophisticated, sublime deliciousness. This is astonishingly good, I�m stuck trying to define it further, and nearly want to give up on that, for it�s a futile excercise, it seems. There�s something extraordinary happening in the glass, it�s a great beer made even better, the alcohol seemingly invisible. This is a beer for special occasions, or for quiet rumination, a brew to be respected, for it favors those who do so. It does something else wonderful, as well, for my troubles, and they have vexed me this evening, have washed away, and those larger concerns seem less dangerous at the moment...it�s a wonderful illusion, and I appreciate the effect immeasurably. Only wish this weren�t so rare an elixir to enjoy! (I have 1 of only 10 growlers in existence, and paid twice the usual price.)
Town Hall Old Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Old Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;A mighty fine old ale. I was excited to see this at the�04 Autumn Brew Review. Super sweet, heavy palate, with notes of raisins, roastiness, and caramel.
Town Hall Old Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Old Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;2004 Autumn Brew Review: Brick Red Coloring. Some Warming from The Alcohol. Fruits - Raisin, Nuts...Balanced and Thick Down Your Throat. Overall, an Excellent Beer!
Town Hall Old Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Old Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"10/29/05: Re-rate. Poured during TH�s week long anniversary celebration. Although the name of this brew was not originally specified as ""French Oak Old Ale"", a read of several of the reviews from last year indicate that it has always been a French Oak Old Ale. Not sure if this is a new batch or a left over batch from last year that has been aging for an additional year. Either way, it is exceptional now just like it was at the 2004 ABR. A definite oak aroma, although somewhat subdued. No head. Reddish brown in appearance with a small, thin, off-white layer around the inside perimeter of the glass. The flavor reveals an obvious oak aging. Very nicely done. Has some notes reminiscent of mead. I love this beer. Perfect balance and warming. I�d love to have a growler of this. Outstanding. 9/12/04: Molasses, roasted malt aroma with hints of raisins and barrel aging. Dark amber body, thin off-white head. Chocolate, caramel and raisin notes. Alcohol hidden pretty well. Good visible carbonation that slowly rises to the top due to the rich thickness and heavy alcohol. One of the best beers at this years Autumn Brew Review. AR 9, Ap 5, Fl 9, Pal 5, Ov 18."
Town Hall Old Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Old Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Town Hall�s best beer in some time. You could mistake this vey thick beer for a barleywine. Sweet and very rich, a slow sipper. Complex taste with fruits and wine. I don�t know the ABV but I am sure it is high. One of the best from Autumn Beer Review �04.
Town Hall Old Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Old Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Autumn Brew Review 2004. Dark red color with a medium head. Very malty aroma and taste. Strong nut presence in the taste as well. Seemed a little thick.
Town Hall Hop It;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;I didn't think this one was too hoppy. Tasted more like a Belgium triple beer. Very fruity and pours a golden orange. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Town Hall Hop It;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours a deep gold, bright and clear, with a huge clump of nearly white head. The head recedes over time - to just covering the top of the beer. Nice lacing. Aroma - inhale deeply for some of the nicest grassy hops you will ever smell. Mmm... Amarillo. Wonderful citrus and floral hop bite up front, followed by a smooth and somewhat grainy malt. Keeping in mind that in spite of all those hops, its NOT an IPA, I�m ok with the relatively lighter body. Its a pale ale - a tangy tasty hop delivery system. Medium carbonation, lots of pine and citrus in the aftertaste.
Town Hall Hop It;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;if hops is your deal, you�ll love this. very one sided on the hops, quite possibly one of the hoppiest i�ve had.
Town Hall Hop It;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Amarillo hops unhinged! I am a big fan of this hop and love the aromatics of this pale ale. I would have preferred some more malt to tame the amarillo like in the Alpha King and Mojo. But the freshness of this from a growler is not to be missed.
Town Hall Hop It;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;#4 in the Town Hall single-hop series,and possibly my favorite? Love those Amarillos, just adore them! Crystal clear, light amber coloration, very pale, with an enormous, milky white head towering above and gently drifting down, leaving lace in the wake. Sweetness and bitterness meet in the nose, a huge citric (orange and lemon, and lime) content, plus lots of tropical fruit (pineapple, papaya,) and big, fat, juicy pine all up and down and over and out, plus an herbal edge, as well. Lively, vibrant, a bit floral, even, and huge in it�s appeal. Stand up and makes you salute. Taste is sweet, slick, and smooth. Hops glide and ride around the palate, but never get too bitter. It lingers on the finish, as well, but that is the hophead�s delight, isn�t it, to feel that fantastic flavor still buzzing on the tastebuds? The body is light, pushing the drinkability factor almost through the roof! Damnably delicious! I really wish all pale ales were like this, honestly! Lacks a bit of balance, malt is really minor here, but I don�t miss it that much. Honestly, this fits the bill as an ideal session brew for yours truly, for the big, hoppy feel never flags on the palate, but it slides down so well, and you never tire of the flavor. I had 2 pints at the pub today, sampling now via growler, but tasted this first cask-conditioned at the 9-11-04 Autumn Brew Review. I will certainly have a hand in this ale�s swift exit from the pub, as I can see many glasses easily drained. Love that Amarillo, fruity, spicy, zesty, yum!
Town Hall Hop It;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On-tap at the brewpub: Seems alot cleaner then the cask version at the fest which after many samples at the Autumn Brew Review I was looking forward to a full pint of this stuff, and I must say it doesn�t disappoint...color is a clear golden yellow with a small fluffy cap of off-whiteness, mega sheets of lacing all over the glass. Minimum slow and sturdy bubbles of carbonation break to the surface. Aroma is a magnificent display of hops with a great play between a pale orange citrus and fresh grassy herb. Malts play lightly underneath with a sweet almost honeyish aspect. Overall very clean and bright with a solid waft captured in each wiff. Taste is amazingly hopped with a bright and clean profile of the amarillo hop cone. Nice front of sweetish candy, honey, malty Kolsch-like malts and the first bit of hops bringing the orangey citrus flavors mingling in a milder tone thats very acceptable in its girth. Ends more herbal/grassy thats incredibly fresh and bright. Bitterness begins to take hold as it floats around in the finish with left over orangey things and some tartish honey notes and fresh grassy hops. First sip is a delight with the bitterness here. The citrusy orange stuff is a joy to behold. Yum, yum, yummy. And that bitterness is never over the top by too much, it seems to maintain that bright fresh edge with just enough set back on the palate to urge interest. Feel is very clean, wickedly smooth, crisp, hoppy, with a bitterness revolving in a mild yet eager character that just screams fresh Amarillo. Body is mellow with a tamer medium body but that overall crisp brightness and freshness just begs for a drinkin�!! Fantastic stuff!
Town Hall Hop It;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;greenish, thin. smooth. one dimensional... almost like a bubbly hop tea. made with amarillo hops as mentioned in town hall�s latest email.
Town Hall Hop It;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;2004 Autumn Brew Review: Light Orange Coloring. Small Head. Lots of Hops and some Citrus. Overall Not Bad.
Town Hall Hop It;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;2004 ABR. Cask. Very nice, dry hoppy aroma. Huge, cascading head while it settles from the pour. Frothy white head. Flavor features some diacetly notes and this brew must be made with Amarillo hops, which unfortunately, are not my favorite. Creamy and soft, like many pulled beers.
Town Hall Hop It;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Any time TH has something on cask I am sure to try it. This simple beer is all about hops. Cloudy appearance. Smooth from the cask.
South Shore Iron Ore Red Lager;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;South Shore Brewery;On tap at the O�so tap house. Pours a clear smber with a red hue snd a light brown head that dissipates to the edges and laces. Aroma has noted of grain and bread with a bit of backing grassy hops. Flavor is similar with grain and hay upfront and a bit of crisp grass lying underneath.
South Shore Iron Ore Red Lager;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;South Shore Brewery;Tap at South Shore Brewery on Nov. 18, 2011. Clear reddish amber pour with a nice white head that laces well. Mild caramel in this, but there is a touch of hops in the taste that works very well.
South Shore Iron Ore Red Lager;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;South Shore Brewery;On Tap at the Great Lakes Brewfest. Reddish amber with a medium white head. Aroma of roasted malt, nuts and mild hops. Taste of sweet malt, nuts and roasted malt. Somewhat chalky in body but not too bad.
South Shore Iron Ore Red Lager;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;South Shore Brewery;Sampled on draught at the ABR 07 in Minneapolis, MN. Pours a clear orange amber brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that leaves behind a white ring a spotty lacing. Aroma of light caramel malt, some flowery hops and a touch of citrus zest. Taste is medium bodied, lightly carbonated with more distinct caramel malt flavor than its aroma. Finish is a good balance of malt and citrus hops to give this a refreshing flavor.
South Shore Iron Ore Red Lager;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;South Shore Brewery;On tap at Deepwater. Pours light rust color with thin off-white head. Faint honey malt aroma. Light body - somewhat grassy. More of a Red-Light. Earlier Rating: 3/28/2006 Total Score: 2.7 Pours an orange amber color. Aroma of roasted malts and caramel. Flavor follows aroma - mildly crisp finish.
South Shore Iron Ore Red Lager;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;South Shore Brewery;Draught sample at the brewpub, late July 2006. Wow, wash I excited that there were TWO lagers on tap during my visit, a golden and a red! Could a man do better? Anyway....medium amber with a thin lasting head and some nice lacing....honey-berry sweet aroma, perhaps a touch of cranberry....sweet body, light alcohol notes, grassy and slightly bitter qualities towards the finish, low carbonation....not bad I guess.
South Shore Iron Ore Red Lager;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;South Shore Brewery;Clear orange-auburn. Nose malty, some chocolate. Flavor is thin and astringent, some caramel and dryness.
South Shore Iron Ore Red Lager;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;South Shore Brewery;ABR� 05. This is a decent effort. A light red beer. Aroma of roasted malt, and the flavor is very dry roasted malt as well. Rather plain, but a decent session beer.
South Shore Iron Ore Red Lager;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;South Shore Brewery;Available only at Pizza Luce in Duluth, I believe. Pours, crystal clear clean red. Light dusky and lemony malt aroma. Flavor is a nice, rich, creamy, heavy and chewy blast of firm malt, mixed with wheat bread, bright yeasts, caramel, brown sugar and dulce de leche. This is nicely rounded and balanced with a sweet kiss of European style hops. Pretty respectable.
South Shore Iron Ore Red Lager;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;South Shore Brewery;Light chestnut color with a touch of ruby. Small off white head. Light alt aromas and little else. Flavors of mild caramel and touch of licorice. Not much going on in this one.
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;Black with thin tan head. Aroma mint, coffee, roasted malt. Medium body, peppermint, dark chocolate, and roasted malt.
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;Sampled at GTMW 2009. Black pour with a fizzy, beige head. Aroma of (surprise) coffee and mint. Flavor is (you guessed it) mostly coffee and mint but blends well with the chocolate maltiness from the stout. This is a very interesting blend and I don�t know of any other beer I have tried that uses mint. But it works. I was intrigued by the concept and pleasantly surprised by the results.
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;ABR �08 - Pours a deep dark brown with a thin off-white head. The nose was strong in mint, with subtle hints of coffee, & chocolate. Came across the palate with a strong coffee but it had a very nice minty finish. Very unique I would defiantly buy this .
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;On Tap at the Great Lakes Brewfest. Dark brown with a thin off-white head. Aroma of chocolate, mint and coffee. Taste of chocolate, mint, roasted malt and mild coffee. It seems kind of gimmicky, but the gimmick seems to work better than their regular beers.
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;GTMW! Black pour with a light tan head. Rich coffee and mint aroma. Flavor was mint, chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Light and thin, could use more body.
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;GTMW �08. Poured a black color with orange highlights. The head was light tan. Smelled of light coffee and chocolate. Medium bodied with the flavor following the nose. There was also some distinct mint which was most prominent at the end. Good stuff.
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;Cask GTMW, thanks to Kan. Aroma is mint, chocolate, coffee. Very minty and sugary. Taste is sweet mint with chocolate and hints of coffee and finishes with more sweet peppermint Andes mint. Decent.
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;On tap at GTMW. Poured deep brown with a creamy cap of deeper tan head. The aroma was sweet with building mint as it progressed.. semi-sweet chocolates supported.. more mint on the back of the nose.. not too complex, but I still enjoyed it. The flavor had sweeter chocolates paired with a hefty dose of mint (Andes candies-like) with drier toasty chocolates through the finish.. left a bright mint impression at the end. Light-medium bodied and a little sticky at the finish. I�m glad I had this at the end of the day because mint really wrecks my palate.
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;Tried this on draft at the brewpub in Ashland. An almost overpowering mint flavor to this one. The first few sips were interesting--it does taste like a mint/chocolate cookie. But by the end, all I could taste was mint and it was a bit like drinking medicine.
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;Great Taste of the Midwest 2008 Convinced to try this by Jason (Ughsmash) late in the game I am glad I gave it some attention. Novel and a nice change of pace it was almost like an alcoholic version of Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies. I wouldn�t have thought that worked yet somehow it blends nicely and fluidly. Aroma / Appearance - The black body had the look of your standard stout complete with a thin head. The nose was not hard to process at all. Peppermint, chocolate and sweet coffee formed a liquid form of everyone�s favorite style of Girl Scout cookie. Flavor / Palate - Laced with peppermint and chocolate the sweetness washes quickly down the throat. Fluid it might be a bit overly sweet but that can be overlooked. The coffee is hidden well but comes out over time. Easy on the stomach this is a worthwhile experience if you catch it on tap somewhere.
South Shore Peach Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;South Shore Brewery;Pours a pale golden yellow with decent white head. Sweet honey peachy aroma. Flavor is light wheat and fruity sweetness but overall seems slightly watered down.
South Shore Peach Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;South Shore Brewery;"Thin golden yellow, with a good level of light white head. Aroma is a sickly sweet honey peach tinged with fruit. Flavor lacks, without much depth; just a tinge of light wheat and fruit. Palate is weak, very watery, without a backbone."
South Shore Peach Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;South Shore Brewery;What a great idea! The peach and wheat profiles are a good match. Might be bending the rules a bit for a wheat, but it�s quite a refreshing summertime brew as a wheat should be.
South Shore Peach Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;South Shore Brewery;2004 Autumn Brew Review: Gold Coloring With Small Head. Peach Aroma...Flavor was Equal on Peach and Wheat. A Very Enjoyable Wheat Beer.
South Shore Peach Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;South Shore Brewery;I suggest this is a fruit beer, as the presence of the fruit is impossible to miss. Clear with no head. Aroma of peach, and the taste of peach as well. Also some wheat. Smooth, a little sweet.
South Shore Peach Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;South Shore Brewery;Autumn Brew Review 2004. Lovely light gold color with a light head. Very good peach aroma and taste. Not much wheat, but it is there. Thankfully, they seemed to have skimped on the citrus (orange and lemon in particular) flavors normally found in a wheat as i do not think they would mesh well with the peach. Wheat beers are starting to bore me, but this one woke me up. Bravo!
South Shore Pumpkinfest Ale;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;South Shore Brewery;Fantastically smooth beer. Highly recommended. Complex spices no harshness and beautifully colored for fall.
South Shore Pumpkinfest Ale;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;South Shore Brewery;Orange/Brown Coloring with Creamy Head. Nice Pumpkin/Maple Aroma. Very Nice Pumpkin Spice Notes..Slowly Dissapating to a Light Dry Hop Ending. Very Nice!
South Shore Pumpkinfest Ale;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;South Shore Brewery;BLBF. Spicy coriander aroma. Burnt-sienna pour. Pumpkin pie spice with lots of all spice and nutmeg, with a pulpy plant flavor that complements. Aftertaste is too spiced out and dry from nutmeg or allspice.
South Shore Pumpkinfest Ale;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;South Shore Brewery;2004 ABR. Very pumpkiny aroma. A friend thought it also smelled Pesto, cilantro, basil, pine nuts. I smelled mostly pumpkin pie. Also smells like saffron. Hazy amber in color. Small, white head. Nice lace. Has a bite with some harshness in the finish.
South Shore Pumpkinfest Ale;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;South Shore Brewery;An orange colored beer.The most spice I have had in a pumpkin ale. Flavors of cinnamon and pumpkin pie. Moderate sweetness.
Brau Brothers IPA;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;From the bottles this beer has a slightly different color for a beer its not blond and its not golden. Aroma is good, taste is ok.
Brau Brothers IPA;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. The brewer is now calling this Brau Extra Pale Ale, but it is essentially the same, I suppose. This IPA has a wonderful citrus aroma from the generous hops. Pours a golden color. Very little head, but the lacing was outstandingly beautiful in the pint glass. The up-front bitterness shakes hands with your tongue. Very nice strong bitter flavor that is not hophead overpowering. The hop bite settles over to the sides of your tongue smoothly giving this beer a wonderful palate. Great finish. This was easily my favorite of the servings at this new brewpub started by a 27 year old brewer, Dustin Brau.
Brau Brothers IPA;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;a very dark IPA. unique, not as hoppy as i�d expect, but the gravity was there. the brewer said that he supplements his higher gravity beers with extract.... sweet, fruity, malty, full of flavor.
Brau Brothers IPA;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;2004 Autumn Brew Review: Reddish Coloring. Small Head. Hops and Malts in This One...Unbalanced With Malts Dominating. A bit Different.
Brau Brothers IPA;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;2004 ABR. Lack of hops in the aroma. All malt. Very dark with reddish hue. Large, light tan head, large bubble. Doesn�t look or taste like an IPA. No hops. Molasses juice? Appearance is nice, but took off a point for not sticking to style.
Brau Brothers IPA;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;Much better than the cream stout. This dark ipa is full of fruit and floral aromas. In the taste more more citrus fruit. Hops are there but not too bitter. Sweet.
Brau Brothers IPA;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;Autumn Brew Review 2004. Oddly enough, this has a very red body with a thin head. Again on the odd side, the aroma is much more malty than hoppy. Hmmm... the taste is fairly dry like an IPA, but the malt overwhelms whatever hops are added. I�m not sure if this is on purpose, but it certainly is not the typical take on IPA. Not too bad, just not a great example of the style.
Sol Brava;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauht�moc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Bottle. I enjoyed the flavor of this pale lager. The personality was mellow and sweet. It did not seem to be watery. It was malty and very well balanced. It went very well with the spicy chili soup I was having. A very pleasant lager.
Sol Brava;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauht�moc-Moctezuma (Heineken);This rating may not be right but picture this .... I�m in mexico sitting on the balcony it�s 10 at night, smoking a cigar and drinking this beer. The waves are relentless crashing on the beach I look over to the hotel next to us and there is 4 young ladies getting ready to go to the bar by trying on every outfit they own. What are you going to do sit back enjoy the cigar you have and watch the show, Life is good at this moment in time. Oh yea the beer it is very drinkable I would do this night over again.
Sol Brava;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauht�moc-Moctezuma (Heineken);"Clear coloured body with a very thin white head. Aroma of metal, strong malt, alcohol and a bit of hops. Light-bodied; Nice malty flavour with cardboard, nuts and a light alcohol kick noticealbe in the taste. Aftertaste is mellow and refined - nice! Overall, one of the best Mexican beers I�ve had - definitely worth trying if you can find it! I sampled this 355 mL bottle purchased from 7-11 in Ciudad de Mexico (Mexico City), Mexico on 04-May-2007."

Sol Brava;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauht�moc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Yeah, malt liquor Mexican style. Sol with a high alcohol flavor that does not stand up well in the light malt.
Sol Brava;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauht�moc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Reminded me of a malt liquor, but that was in part to the huge size of the bottle. Couldn�t get through the whole thing. Alcohol was a bit noticable, but not horribly overpowering. Decent as a novelty.
Sol Brava;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauht�moc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Other than a non-offensive aroma, this stuff is garbage. A strong malt liquor type of flavor. It�s so bad that I can�t even use it combat the spiciness of the chinquinquillas I�m eating. Ick.
Sol Brava;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauht�moc-Moctezuma (Heineken);What�s wrong with you guys? This beer is great! is awesome! is amazing! is outstanding! great flavor for a strong beer... yummy..
Sol Brava;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauht�moc-Moctezuma (Heineken);got this in mexico for 15.5 pesos thats 1.50 US, and it was great. I got 50 ounces and although I tasted the alcohol the beer flavor kicked in nicely. Ok fine, so its not a high quality beer but as far as 40�s go (or 50�s) this one takes the cake.
Ottos Arthurs Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;What Otto�s seemed to lack in inspiration for the IPA was simply diverted here to their RIS. Fantastic beer. Served beautifully in snifter glass it was perfect. Appearance: Looked black to me in the lighting, but when examined closely you could find hints of red around the edges. Smell: Big roasted malt aroma filled the nose in a single whiff. Taste: This ia a massive RIS, packed full of smoked roasted malts chocolate, molasses and cherry. Mouthfeel: Very smooth. It is not as sticky and thick as a Rogue Impy Stout but still creamy enough. Drinkability: I am a huge fan of this style and this beer. It is far from sessionable but certainly easy to drink. Hope this is helpful. Cheers!
Ottos Arthurs Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Good imperial stout, but a bit watery. I mainly tasted coffee, but with the standard chocolate and other flavors for support. Lots of roasted flavor, creamy texture, but it could�ve been thicker.
Ottos Arthurs Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Cask during Thanksgiving. Very dark pour with aroma of roast malt, molasses, chocoff. Tastes complex, full-bodied, yet a bit light for an Impy, with notable complexity. I tastes roast malt, rauch, chocoff, molasses, almonds, and prunes here.
Ottos Arthurs Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Cask... Poured opaque black with a small tan head and nice lacing on the glass. Aroma was sweet and roasted, some chocolate, and dark fruits, most notably figs, which came through as the beer warmed up. Taste was lots of chocolate and roast, some vanilla and a little bit of smoke as well, with just a little bit of alcohol. The mouthfeel was creamy, though it could have been fuller than it came across as.
OHaras Sommer Weizen;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;2004 ABR. With this beer, I have exceeded my previous monthly ratings record of 56. Banana & clove notes typical of the Weissbier style. Very pale yellow, slightly cloudy, body with small white head that is mostly lasting. Banana notes are evident. Pleasant. Nice palate.
OHaras Oatmeal Stout;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;Some roasted maltiness and smoke but thin and watery.Like a crappy stout vs a sweet stout.

Barkley Sound Amber Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;This might just be one of the worst beers I�ve had in a few months. Very un-beer like in many ways, it reminded me almost of some kinda Zima fizzy type malt liquor. Aroma was slightly malty, but you really had to dig deep to get it. Flavor was...well, not much really except for a bit of tired malt. Tons and tons of carbonation with this one, hence the earlier description. Near the level of club soda. Thankfully I think I only paid 50 cents for this at the Grocery Outlet. Yeech.
Barkley Sound Amber Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;Pours a clear brown with a small white head. Slight malty aroma, but mostly just standard beer smells. Flavor is the same, not much character.
Barkley Sound Amber Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;From the Party Source in KY. Light brown color, short fizzy head, no lacing. Aroma was light and malty, very faint. Thin palate, tiny sharp carbonation, any traces of maltiness were scrubbed away by the sharp little bubbles leaving a dusty dry finish that was just not exciting at all.
Barkley Sound Amber Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of foam with a frothy top fine to medium sized bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a transparent softly carbonated dark orange brown colored body. The mild aroma was malty dirty and dough. The crisp mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The thin flavor contained notes of malt astringent sweet and Irish red malt. An OK brew just nothing special.
Barkley Sound Amber Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;Bottle. Small white fizzy head that mostly diminished, no lacing, minimal carbonation, trnasparent, and an orange hue witih a red tint appearance. Nose and flavor were both very minimal with the only aroma and flavor I could detect was maltiness and that was even pushing it. Tingly mouthfeel and light body. Do not recommend.
Barkley Sound Amber Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;Bottle: Aroma was skunky and of bitter. Amber body head didn�t last long. Flat bitter aluminum can flavor that leaves a stale aftertaste. Almost a drain pour.
Barkley Sound Amber Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;Tasteless...very thin body...overly fizzy...no head...tasted more like sparkling water than beer. I can�t believe that this is classified as an American Dark Lager.
Barkley Sound Amber Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;Bottle. Reddish amber color with a small white head that was gone quickly. Light sweet aroma. Light body with a thin texture. Light sweet malt flavor with no finish.
Barkley Sound Amber Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;"Somewhat reddish-brown. Little nose, flavor is I guess sweet, though saying ""flavor"" is really a pretty big stretch. This is probably good, as it came in a clear bottle. Didn�t know until I popped on to rate it that it was Gluek. Gee, what a shock. Another crappy beer out of Cold Spring."
Barkley Sound Amber Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;2004 Autumn Brew Review: Prune Coloring. Ugh...Let the Smallest Part of Your Tongue Touch It and Find a Drain. Bad Malt.. I say no More.
Bandana Waseca Honey Wheat;Mankato, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Bandana Brewery;2005 ABR: Very little going on here. Not much wheat flavor, not much honey, either. Mainly a very light, watered-down lager-type brew.

King and Barnes Ale;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Sept, 2004: Bottled. Fresh and delicate flavours suggest that this has NOT been pasteurised, yet there�s no sediment. Cold filtered? Whatever - this is a spanking ale. Tastes like the cask version, but with a bit of harsh carbonation. Tasty stuff. [3.4]
King and Barnes Ale;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Bottle (K&B Ale), from York Beer Shop. Attractive deep amber bronze, good lasting fluffy white head and gentle condition. Good blend of biscuity malt and peppery hops in the nose, nutty at first in the mouth but with the hop character developing and dominating with time. Slightly thin and metallic but still pleasantly quenching. Finish has caramel and hop bitterness lingering. A good session beer.
King and Barnes Ale;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Bottle. Amber coloured beer, with creamy off-white head. Hoppy aroma. Lightly malty and hoppy taste. Medium bodied, reasonable mouthfeel, lightly carbonated. Quite tasty, not bad, just too weak (for me).
King and Barnes Ale;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Bottled, pasteurised (Bought from a Safeway in Somerset). Orange amber with a healthy head, still. Total surprise to fo find that this has not been rated before, probably new to the range of Hall & Woodhouse, Badger, King & Barnes, its getting quite confusing. Lovely balance to this though and a particularly fresh hoppy note for a pasteurised beer. Light malty and refreshing, a very nice bottled bitter.
King and Barnes Ale;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Good flavour for a beer with 3.5% alc. in it, but lacks the flavour i like, still easy to drink and pleasant.

Piers, my son, is taking me to see Stalker at the National Film Theatre. It must be over ten years since I last saw this film - and I�ve never seen it in the cinema - so I�m quite excited. We�ve walked along the Thames from Tower Bridge stopping at several pubs along the way. We�ve now got to the Market Porter and all ten beers on offer I�ve had. But I enjoy this - clean, smooth and light with a touch of green apple and buble gum. Some sulphur in the nose. [3.0]

Head retention nice with a thick small-bubbled creamy head. Aromatic with spices and a yeasty nose. Up front malty sweetness to the taste with spices and esters. However, the beer then suddenly disappears, leaving you with a ""hey, what happened to the taste?"" feeling. Very much on the light side of things, but a good showing for a Spilker product."

The taste varies over slightly light bread, very few notes of ripe banana and otherwise a fresh malt sweet taste of fresh grain.

Paper City Denogginator;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Paper City Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a lager glass. The appearance was fairly dark brown color with a decent retention in the head which was somewhat eggshell brown colored. Dissipation was fairly slow. Light moderate lace. The aroma had some sweet dark fruit, brown sugar, earthy hops, light grassiness, some bready/doughy-ness and ended with a little bit of milk chocolate. The flavor leaned into the sweetness of the blend of the prior mentioned aromas leading into the same sort of aftertaste following into the finish. The feel was about medium bodied and having a stable carbonation and a worthy ABV. Overall, this was actually reviewed fresh, but I don�t have a date when I actually consumed this, just a while ago, sorry I only got these notes, just last week. Apologies to whoever might be reading this.

Paper City Denogginator;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Paper City Brewery;15-Sep-13 (12-oz bottle: Obtained in trade with 46er3498, thanks Tom!) I let this one go too long, so it�s not going to be the same beer it was when fresh, but it�s still very tasty. The beer is medium-brown in color with good clarity, and it�s initially capped by half an inch of tan head that settles quickly to a thin ring. The nose is very sweet and malty with tootsie roll and dark, dried fruit, brown sugar, and a bit of earthiness. It�s also very rich in dark, fruity, malty flavors. Prune, cola, chocolate, molasses. It�s full bodied, light-medium in carbonation, and would be a bit cloying except for the light touch of acidity in the background. Overall, this doppelbock has evolved into a pretty intense and dark-flavored beer, but unlike most doppelbocks that cellar awhile, this one is very tasty and enjoyable.
Paper City Denogginator;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Paper City Brewery;12oz. Bottle: Aroma of malts, dark fruits, plums, nuts, and dates. Poured medium brown with a hint of ruby in color and a small, tan head that disappeared quickly. Clear. Not sparkling. Flavor is lightly sweet. Tastes of alcohol, brown sugar, malts, nuts, molasses, and dark fruits. Medium body. Oily texture. Soft carbonation. Malt-sweet, alcohol and dark fruit finish.
Paper City Denogginator;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Paper City Brewery;12 oz. bottle... nice extra from Ty5592! Hazy chocolate brown pour with a medium head. Faint caramel, dark fruit aroma. Flavor is roasted malt, caramel, raisins, banana and something I really like that I can�t quite put my finger on. Alcohol is definitely noticeable but blends well. Eminently drinkable, and definitely one of the better doppelbocks I�ve had.
Paper City Denogginator;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Paper City Brewery;"12 oz. bottle - thanks to Ty5592 for the bonus bottle; deep, cola brown; clear with thin white head; candy malts and sweet, mild aromas; grainy and sweet; nothing too exciting, but a very tasty and slightly rich"
Paper City Denogginator;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Paper City Brewery;"A vigorous pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a two-finger thick, lightly cocoa stained tan colored head. The beer is a very dark, burnt, concentrated amber color and shows a brilliantly clear, cranberry hue when held up to the light. The aroma is thick, sweet and chewy. It has quite a bit of fruitiness to it actually with notes of berries and brandy soaked raisins. Noticeable alcohol adds a bit of warmth / heat in my nose, but can be fairly subtle at times. Underneath the fruitiness is a rich malt character that provides notes of caramelized bread crust, toasty grain, sweet concentrated amber malts, something a bit like cola and some light toasted malt notes towards the finish. Rich and chewy up front, but seems to thin out a bit pretty quickly in the first sip. The second and subsequent sips have a bit more palate coating chewiness to them though. Sweet tasting, almost a bit too sweet, which makes it seem a bit like non-alcoholic malzbier. Concentrated malt notes produce flavors of toffee, caramelized bread crust, raisins, . A light bitterness in the finish seems to be as much a product of the darker malts as of hop bitterness; it adds a hint of astringency as well. As the beer warms up quite a bit it loses some of the sticky sweetness, or at least this gets balanced a bit better by the richer malt flavors. A touch of alcohol adds a bit of warmth to the flavor. The aroma can seem a little too sweet at times; a Doppelbock should have some sweetness, but it should be a rich, complex sweetness that this one doesn�t quite achieve. Not a bad beer, enjoyable enough, but it could certainly be a bit more complex."
Paper City Denogginator;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Paper City Brewery;Pours burnt sienna with 1-finger tan head. Nose is roasty caramel/scotchy malt, figs, brown sugar, hops, and raisins. Tastes rich, with a hefty malt bill, matched by brown sugar, fig/raisins, almond, earthy peaty notes, and slight rauchy and port winey notes. Fairly complex in flavor profile and palate characteristics, this one is one I�m glad to have bought a sixer of.
Paper City Denogginator;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Paper City Brewery;Bottle. Pours a dark brown color that you can see through if you look hard enough. Small off white head that leaves rather quickly. Nice aroma of roasted malt, light peat, and light caramel/raisins. The taste is basicly the same with sweet malty light smoke flavor. This was a very good beer.
Paper City Denogginator;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Paper City Brewery;Pours deep mahogany into a stem glass. offwhite micro head recedes to skim surface and hug rim. Pit fruit and chocolate aromas. Sweet and full with upfront caramel and a lasting tart finish.

The Duck-Rabbit Brown Ale;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;Got as a gift 6-pack. Sour, thin, over-carbonated.

The Duck-Rabbit Brown Ale;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;Pours clear but doesn't hold much head. Powdered chocolate aroma and some general maltiness.

A 1"" cream colored head drops slowly with moderate lacing. Color is reddish brown. Aroma of caramel, chocolate, mild citrus. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly powdery with a mostly dry finish.

The Duck-Rabbit Porter;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;Good porter, if a tad thin. Pours a solid dark brown-black, and the nose gives up coffee and chocolate like a good porter should. Taste is right in line, coffee acidity mingling with bitter cocoa and a mild cherry-raisin tartness. Never grows sweet, which is nice, and the fade stays dry, mild hop bitterness accentuating the mocha finish. Feel isn�t great, but we can deal with it.

The Duck-Rabbit Porter;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;BBD not notched. Pours black. Below normal head volume, very poor lacing and poor retention of what little head there was. Very good nose of dark chocolate, light roast, caramel notes and light molasses. Slightly above light body, but not heavy light. The texture is smooth. World class carbonation / body balance. Effervescence begins with a nice mid palate burst and culminates in a finely bubbled prickly finish. The flavor profile is good, but lacks the complexity to achieve very good. It begins with light roast then adds a bit of char. The middle has almost no bitterness. What there is char based. Just enough sweetness arrives to make the bitter chocolate noticeable. The finish is a slow fade of light bitter chocolate and char.

Royal Oak Anniversary Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Royal Oak Brewery;From what I remember, this was a decent, high alcohol beer that had a good malty taste. A pity that they only did a little bit for a little while.

Royal Oak Anniversary Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Royal Oak Brewery;On tap: Aroma of fruit, toffee, and caramel. Pours a dark reddish-brown with no transparency, but that could be due to lighting. Nice off-white head. Fruity up front with grape. Nice caramel presence. Finishes somewhat acidic with a hint of raspberry tartness. Alcohol is masked very well. Light citrus hops in the finish.
Royal Oak Anniversary Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Royal Oak Brewery;Great looking beer, deep reddish brown with a light off white head. Rich malt aroma, very little hop aroma, but great complexity with the malt, chocolate, nutty munich, sweet raisoney caramel. Good malty flavor, not too sweet, but the complexity from the malt is there in a smooth balanced package. Good mouthfeel, light carbonation (as served) but nice for the type of the beer. This is the type of beer you want to serve at your 10th anniversary party, well done.
Royal Oak Anniversary Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Royal Oak Brewery;Tenth Anniversary Ale on tap at Royal Oak BC. Deep red body, medium light tan head. Berryish malty aroma, with some citric, rindy hops. The body was surprisingly balanced towards the malty side of things, with caramel, berries, cereals, and toasty notes in addition to a hint of cherry. Alcohol was surprisingly subdued. American Strong Ale is probably the best category for this beer, but it reminded me of a strong Scotch Ale with the sweet, twig-n-berries malt complexity. Nice.

Royal Oak Anniversary Ale;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Royal Oak Brewery;Not a bad double IPA. But then again, not a great one either. The color wasn��t very attractive. Murky, ugly grayish brown. The flavor, however, was pretty decent. Nice and hoppy, some hints of metallic iron. Good maltiness. This beer was inspired, but didn�t quite meet the inspiration. I will say, however, that it really grew on me, so I am giving it a fairly decent overall score.

Rock Bottom Minneapolis Als Sweet Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;"Pours a very dark brown - nearly black. A good 2"" of deep brown foam on top. Leaves beautiful foam lace behind. Just a bit of kahlua in the aroma. Exceptionally smooth and mellow, very pronounced chocolate maltiness. Finishes on the sweet side, still lots of chocolate. Very full mouthfeel. Sweet yet balanced. Excellent dessert beer - but save room for two"
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Als Sweet Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Black color with a tall head. Very lovely coffee aroma, but not bitter. The taste is interesting: slightly bitter chocolate and coffee, but morphing into a solid sweetness. There was a distinct fruitiness as well... like a cherry truffle. Tasty fine!
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Als Sweet Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Black Coloring With Big Baked Chocolate Head. Aroma of Sweet Malt and Chocolate. First Taste Was �Foamy� As the Head Had Not Resided Yet, But Once I Got To The Actual Brew, It Was Very Enjoyable. Wonderful Sweet Malts, and a Flavor Agreeable Distinguished as Chocolate Covered Cherries....and Actually Ended a Bit Bitter and Just a Sliver of Dryness. Definitly Had Some Character to It and Would Definitly go Back for This Brew!
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Als Sweet Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Very black in colour. Medium aromas of chocolate and a bit of coffee. Sweet malty chocolate flavor, along wth some vanilla. A bit on the watery side. My favorite of all of the Rock Bottom beers that I tried.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Als Sweet Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;I�d had a pint at the pub previously, but consider this now from a growler filled earlier this afternoon. Appearance: deep, dark, thorugh blackness, sludgy even, not a glint of lint gets through, but, alas, little carbonation arises... Aroma, ah! Sweetness, depth, and rich character, all unfold in one sniff, more than I�d expect from a sweet stout (and more than I remember from my pint at the pub a few weeks ago), seriously studded with earthy delights, molasses, dark rum, anise and treacle, like a wicked liquid licorice whip, but none too stunning in the strength. Taste: very mild, sweet, mellow, pleasant, that rich flavor returns, but without an overbearing body, nor too much to bedevil the tongue, just smooth riding all the way down, the way a sweet stout ought to be. Funny, that�s not usual a style that I favor, going more for Oatmeals, or in some moods, Imperials. This is ideal for non-confrontational drinkin�, though. You know, the type most folks turn to light lagers, amber ales, or ESBs for, and it�s great to find that in a stout as well. I would turn to this often at the pub, personally, unless something more tempting were around.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Amarillo Warrior IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Bittered with Warrior and Amarillo hops. Dry-hopped with just Amarillo. Pours a hazy golden amber with a bit of a peachy coloration. The haziness is from the dry-hopping, I think it is clearing over time. It is less hazy than it was on the Saturday pubcrawl (when my partner in crime got a couple of hop leaf floaties in his pour). Maybe a half inch of nearly white soft foamy head. It leaves a nice lace as you drink the beer. Carbonation is good, the bubbles are tiny. To me, the aroma was piney and hoppy. First sip is all hops. Bold piney citrus hops. So is the second sip. And the third. So is the next pint... You get the idea. Nothing in the malt stands out, it is all hops to me. There must be some good malt in there, because it isn�t overly bitter (for me), but then again, I really like super-hoppy IPAs. I don�t know what the IBUs are, but this one tastes even hoppier than the 100 IBU Big Red they released earlier this year. Grassy hops in the finish, more piney hops in the aftertaste. Apart from the hops, the beer is smooth. I don�t think it is too thin, but would understand if other people called it thin for an IPA. Or if they called it too thin for the amount of hops.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Amarillo Warrior IPA;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Consumed from a growler, after having one at the pub earlier... Hazy, peachy color, fresh, frothy white head, though slim. Aroma: immediately speaks of pine, pineapple, citrus, grapefruit, bristling with hoppiness... Taste: again, the hops speak up, yet the voices fade away fast, not without leaving a memento, though, in the distinct hoppy feel. Less full-bodied than I�d like though, this, actually is more fully-flavored from the growler than the pint I had this afternoon. (perhaps a carbonation issue was to blame?) In any case, I came away from my lunchtime repast with a growler fully ready to express disappointment that I felt at the pub, but, damnit, she holds up pretty well, and I have no complaints! One more sip to make sure...yep, it�s hoppy, fruity, tasty, tingly, citric, devilishly delicious...I went into this review thinking I�d pan it, but here�s no cause at all! Very nice single-hop IPA, very tasty...yum...yum.. Seriously, at the pub i thought I�d have to lowball it, but drinking it now, it�s groovalicious!

The head was thick and tan with good retention and lacing. Smelled of molasses, light coffee, and chocolate. Medium bodied with a smooth nitro-pour mouth feel.

Rock Bottom Minneapolis Erin Isle Irish Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Pours nice and deep and inky black, with easily an inch or two of brown foam - very bubbly . Decent lacing throughout the mug club glass. Mild aromatic and roasty malt. Nice mild yet flavorful taste - mellow roasted malt, a bit of molasses, with a somewhat oily and fruity finish. Not as dry as I expected, but I am ok with that �cuz it is nice and tasty. A little pine hops in the finish - somewhat subdued green chlorophyll. Good balance, with a rather nice mouthfeel
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Erin Isle Irish Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;This brew is replacing, not sure if permanently or temporarily, Al�s Sweet Stout. Sweet, rich, strong dark roasted malt aroma. Opaque body, but no head. Flavor nowhere near as good as the aroma. Below average stout.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Erin Isle Irish Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Black Coloring with Tan Ring. Good Malt Aroma and Flavor. Roasts Present as Well. Solidly Average Stout...Bit Quirky.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Erin Isle Irish Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Black color with a medium head that quickly fell down to nothing. Aroma of burnt coffee and roasts. Sweet malt taste with an attempt at a whisky finish, but it comes off more like Windex than anything else. Very thin. Strange.
Obolon Hike Light;Kyiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Obolon;Little dense and long-lasting foam. Yellow color clearly much limpid and diamond. Delicate aroma without pretensions. Medium taste with a body not too much strongly. Decided, bitter in prominence but altogether very balanced flavor. Not watery but very refreshing. One agreeable surprise.
Obolon Hike Light;Kyiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Obolon;Not too bad a brew. Needs something to make it more authorative but all in all a tasty beer. Nice head & nice aftertaste..somewhat wheaty. Good with poultry & soups.

Boundary Bay Single Hop - Liberty;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boundary Bay Brewery;Apparently the Simcoe Pale Ale was nice and flowery while the Cascade Ale is fairly citrusy, the Liberty Pale seemed more mellow while also being more palatable although perhaps less flavorful. Nice and smooth with a distinctively straightforward flavor (not surprisingly from the mono-hopping) but rather well done. Bravo Boundary.
Boundary Bay Single Hop - Cascade;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boundary Bay Brewery;"From tap. Pours golden amber and hazy; with a touch of citrus notes. Taste is lively and fizzy, finish is very pleasent. There�s some bitterness but not as much, as the standard domestic mass produced beer; however this beer is nowhere near standard or regular. Great tasting and good with all types of food."
Boundary Bay Single Hop - Cascade;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boundary Bay Brewery;Very bright hop character but as is typical with Cascade hops the IBUs are screamin� but there is little to no finish. This is an experiment, and a successful one, but it�s proof that a beer utilizing Cascade hops needs something else to round it out a bit.
Millstone Edge;Ashton-Under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Millstone Brewery;Cask conditioned handpump The Pub Leicester. An orange coloured beer with a white bubbly head. The aroma is a touch sweet and a little rubbery through the fruity hops. Tropical fruit flavours are hinted at but it seems underhopped and again there are rubbery notes. I expected better from Millstone

Dnipro Svitle;Donetsk, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Donetskiy Pivovarennyj Zavod;bottle. Golden yellow, large head. Grainy nose. Malty and grainy flavours, not very hoppy. The aroma somehow reminded me of breakfast cereals.

Mighty Oak Bar Exercises (2004);Maldon, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Bright bottled at Chappel. This foamed up like a broken washing machine when it was being poured. And then transferring it into my bottle was a laugh. Worth all the effort though. Fresh and tasty. Delicate, flowery citric notes. Well behaved quality pale malt. A clean, refreshing session beer of enourmous and beautiful flavour. Mighty Oak are a damned decent brewery.
Aass Balders Brygg;Drammen, Norway;Flavored - Other;Aass Bryggeri;330 ml bottle. Golden body with a very small white head. Aroma is not strong, quite ordinary grainy as usually for an Aass pilsner, but coming aware of the story behind this beer you may sense several interesting herbs in your nose. It�s not strong, but they are there similar to what you find in many Norwegian aquavit. The same goes for the flavor, first a quite ordinary Aass pilsner, a bit on the sweeter side, then a hint of some herbal spices. The spices are not really distinct for me, except for the anis maybe. I really like this idea, but I think this would have been lot more interesting with another base beer than lager.
Aass Balders Brygg;Drammen, Norway;Flavored - Other;Aass Bryggeri;Bottle: Light yellow colour, with a flat head. Aroma of grain, and dry hops. Flavor is grainy,som sweet elemets,thin body, short bitter finish.
Aass Balders Brygg;Drammen, Norway;Flavored - Other;Aass Bryggeri;Bottled. Yellow colour, no head. Herbal spicy aroma. The interesting spices, the same a s in aquavit, on top a very average beer. A little sweet with vague malt character and a bitterness that only derives from herbal spices.
Aass Balders Brygg;Drammen, Norway;Flavored - Other;Aass Bryggeri;(330 ml bottle). This beer is contract brewed by Aass by the initiative of Mr. Arvid Ystad. I had a nice conversation with him about the background of his initiative. He also sent me a memo about the use of herbs in Norwegian traditional brewing. However, this beer is not an ale like traditional Norwegian farmbrew, it is based on a standard Aass pale lager with juniper berries, caraway/cumin and tarragon (estragon) added in the brewing process. These are herbs recognizable by modern Norwegians from the flavouring of aquavit, and Mr. Ystad emphasizes that they were already well known in Norway from the art of brewing, when aquavit was invented at a much later stage. Balders Brygg (named after Odin�s son Balder, Norse mythology) looks like a standard pale lager with a moderate head, but the aroma and flavour are much better due to the herbs used. The tarragon and caraway (to some degree reminiscent of aniseed) dominate both aroma and flavour, while the juniper berries are more subdued. Mr. Ystad himself thinks that the tarragon is more dominant than he intended, I would also like the juniper berries to stand out more than they do. But these herbs can't hide the fact that the basis of this beer is a pale lager with a rather thin mouthfeel. Props to Mr. Ystad for his initiative, but Aass Bryggeri should clearly have taken a leap forward and made an ALE with these herbs. As it is, Balders Brygg is at least a nice change of pace from the standard pilseners / pale lagers that dominate the Norwegian beer scene.
Maguires Celtic Cream;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Cream Ale;Maguires Irish Pub & Brewery (Malt House Brewing Co.);500ml plastic bottle purchased from the brewery store poured straw in color with a small white head that left virtually no lacing behind.

The best that this brewery has to offer, which is not saying much.

Aroma of cold coffee and stale malts. Flavour was chalky, oily, some coffee and chocolate, slight sourness. Finished very dry and sour. Not the best made stout. Thanks for supplying this CapFlu.
Maguires Seamus Stout;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Stout;Maguires Irish Pub & Brewery (Malt House Brewing Co.);What the hell were we thinking having bad beer after bad beer at the November gathering at CapFlu�s place. At least the ratings a few beers from now will be of highly enjoyed beers. This one however was a thin coffee & cigarettes stale beer. It had the requisite appearance of a stout, and some of the oily coffee aromas, but then it completely fell apart. Kind of sour, instead of nicely bitter, to finish. Cheers again though to CapFlu for bringing this out from his travels.
Maguires Seamus Stout;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Stout;Maguires Irish Pub & Brewery (Malt House Brewing Co.);"Bottle, choked down alongside CapFlu, tiggmtl, Rastacouere, Beerhugger, Radiomgb, and DumDum in Ottawa.

Maguires Summerfest Lager;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Maguires Irish Pub & Brewery (Malt House Brewing Co.);(Draught) Another example of how scent and taste don�t necessarily match. Pours a clear gold body with a thin white head. Perfumy nose with slight nail polish. Flavour is incredibly astringent with corn and alcohol notes. Disgusting!

Hose & Hydrant Iceberg Pale Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hose & Hydrant Brewing (Blackstrap Hospitality Corp.);Well what can I say. I was told this was very bad but I did not think it could be worse than the Labatt�s Shok. I was wrong. Poured with a small head that disapeared quickly. Light ginger in color. Some what sweet in smell but lacking in taste.
Hose & Hydrant Iceberg Pale Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hose & Hydrant Brewing (Blackstrap Hospitality Corp.);"2L bottle smuggled across the Provincial border by an unamed soucre. This is NOT an amber ale in this incarnation. To repeat Fiend, since I said it and he wrote it ""a pale ginger-ale like brew"" with a sticky white foamy head on top. A strong sweet aroma wafts from across my desk. Taking the dare I bring the glass closer. Upon closer inspection the aroma is indeed sweet but with a baby malt liquor alcohol trace. An amazing beer. How do they make it taste like nothing and still give it that lingering malt liquor finish without the malt liquor high alcohol."
Hose & Hydrant Iceberg Pale Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hose & Hydrant Brewing (Blackstrap Hospitality Corp.);A strong aroma was present from the foamy white head. The head dissappeared almost immediatly although the gingerale-looking brew stayed reasonably carbonated throughout the glass. A hint of hops was present but the beer was definately lacking something in its flavor.
Hose & Hydrant Iceberg Pale Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hose & Hydrant Brewing (Blackstrap Hospitality Corp.);(Draught) Medium, white frothy head and a mildly carbonated, weak yellow body.

Hose & Hydrant Prairie Cerveza;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hose & Hydrant Brewing (Blackstrap Hospitality Corp.);Poured from a 2L bottle.

I finished the beer...barely."
Hose & Hydrant Prairie Cerveza;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hose & Hydrant Brewing (Blackstrap Hospitality Corp.);2L bottle. Looks like an unfiltered wheat beer with soap ring for a head. Smells like a collection of unwrapped penny candy six months after purchase. Could be the lemon, the yeast or the lack of malt. Tastes flat like an uncarbonated home brew that did not have enough malt and did not ferment. Watery, unflavoured and a polyester finish. On the Bov scale a 5 since I can finish a glass.
Hose & Hydrant Prairie Cerveza;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hose & Hydrant Brewing (Blackstrap Hospitality Corp.);(Draught) Nice lacing. White foamy head and a light yellow body. Nose of an English CRAPPER! No carbonation. Urinal odour tranfers into a non-drinkable pee-flavoured brew. One of the worst beers I�ve ever sampled.

Kuhnhenn Brothers Gold (K�lsch);Warren, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"This poured a golden ye;;pw color with a white head. Aroma was light german grassy hops and 2 row malt. Flavor was a bit of butterscotch and light hops. Nothing interesting here."
Kuhnhenn Brothers Gold (K�lsch);Warren, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Kuhnhenn Brewing;On tap at the Devil�s Den in South Philly. I have no idea how they got this beer but I was very excited and made a trip there last night just to try it. Pours a slightly hazy dark golden amber orange with light golden yellow hues when held to a light source and a one finger frothy white head that quickly fades into a lasting ring. No lacing. Very sweet citrus aroma that smells mostly of lemon juice. There is a healthy dose of citrus lemon peel as well as some biscuit malt, subtle hops and lemon zest. Fuller end of medium body some some nice yeasty bready notes. Very sweet citrus peel presence that again is mostly lemon juice and lemon zest. Graham cracker biscuity malt and nice crisp hops lying underneath. The sweetness form the lemon flavor is way too overpowering, like someone squeezed an ounce or tow of lemon juice in my glass. This really hurts the drinkability and really ruins a lot of the positives of this beer.
Kuhnhenn Brothers Gold (K�lsch);Warren, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Pours a light gold in color with a huge inch and a half rocky head. Smell is all wheat and malt. Very strong wheat and malt. Taste is crisp, clean and light. Plenty of lemon zest and very light in the taste. This is a good, hot, humid summer day beer. Very true to the style. Decent.
Kuhnhenn Brothers Gold (K�lsch);Warren, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Draught at the brewery. Pours a clear pale yellow/gold with a small white head that dimnishes to a ring around the glass. The aroma is light citrus and floral hops and light grass. The flavor has light yeast, earthy hops, light malt , and medium bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium to light and fairly smooth. Flavor is short lived.
Kuhnhenn Brothers Gold (K�lsch);Warren, Michigan, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Draft at the brewery, is a deep gold with a white head that thinned to a ring, some effervescent bubbles rise to the top, left lots of lacing on the glass, aroma of malt and fruit fragrances, a dry malt aroma with faint hops, malt and bread flavor that reminds me of a pilsner but more so in flavor, some fruit flavor and more hop crisp bitterness than I have encountered in other Kolschs, some citrus in the finish combined with the hop bite to give a good dry finish, thick mouth feel, medium or less carbonation, not as light of a drink as I was expecting, tasty.
Manos Screamin Eagle Pale Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Manos Grill & Brewpub;Long story with this one. The short version is that my dad brough a Litre bottle back, although the label says 2L. The bottle leaked a little bit and after I picked up the beer I was holding it while driving and came upon a check stop! The beer is pale with little head. As my 3rd Manos� beer I am reminded off generic Duff beers. Thin flavour. Some bitter hops with no malt. A backing diesel edge.
Manos Screamin Eagle Pale Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Manos Grill & Brewpub;Hazy light gold with barely any head or carbonation. Sweet fruity aroma, not enjoyable, artificial. Very sweet beer , almost like a shandy, with notes of grape juice. Lots of alcohol and metallic sharpness in middle of tasting. Makes you scream for the exit. Kinda of oversweet, so the palate is all wrong. Canned. From the Capflu.
Manos Screamin Eagle Pale Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Manos Grill & Brewpub;(Draught) I guess this is supposed to be the big brother to White Tail but it really hasn�t made much of an impression at all. Its tart and acidic and not to my liking... maybe the 2 litre Clear bottle in the Manos Off-Sale will taste better...
Manos Bison White;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Manos Grill & Brewpub;sharp rubbery aroma. Slightly cloudy with thin white head. You have to wonder if they didn�t filter it for style, or if they were just lazy. Rubber and alcohol taste. I�m going with lazy.
Manos Bison White;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Manos Grill & Brewpub;My can says Canadian Wild Life Beer and a sticker says White Bison. It is 8%. Pale yellow. No head. Initial mellon aroma with some alcohol. Wierd mellon start with alcohol finish. Just not enough in this beer. It could have almost been an interesting malt liquor.

Rather weak aroma with some nutty, caramel-ish maltyness and a hint of prunes. The flavor has the same problem, it�s a bit weak, but it�s nice, with nuts, caramel and some dried fruits.Soft carbonation, medium body. A quite pleasant one, but I�d wish for more punch all the way. 120623

Etzelwanger M�rzen;Etzelwang, Bavaria, Germany;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei P�rner;Bottle, thanks pivnizub. Surprisingly dark for a M�rzen - opaque red chestnut, cappucino head. Doppelbockish sweet malt nose which carries over in to the malt flavorbase, tilts over into a sugary, somewhat thin body. A few aromatic hops, could be more pronounced, but do give a fresh citric note towards the finish. Interresting brew which just lacks the last edge.
Etzelwanger M�rzen;Etzelwang, Bavaria, Germany;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei P�rner;"Bottle: Clear, deep chestnut-amber coloured, visible carbonation, rather quickly diminishing loose off-white head, fruity (raisins) and a bit roast-malty nose, almost with a chocolatey touch; moderate to solid sweet-bitter flavour; discreet fruitiness in the bitter-sweet finish. Spicy and dark........"
Etzelwanger Festbier;Etzelwang, Bavaria, Germany;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei P�rner;Als �Kellerbier (Festbier)� auf dem Felsenkeller Etzelwang, leider aus der Flasche. - Satt goldgelb, klar. - In der Nase blasses s��liches Karamelmalz, mild hopfenw�rziger Hopfen. - Antrunk f�r ein Festbier eher schlank, mild malzs��, leicht karamellig, zart fruchtig. Durchschnittlich rezent, wenig Festbier-artig. Im Abgang blasse orangenfruchtige Hopfenherbe. - Etwas d�nnes und s��es, immerhin s�ffiges Festbier.

Rostocker 3.5% Bier;Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hanseatische Brauerei Rostock (Radeberger Gruppe);Canned. Pale golden, very brief head. Light bodied, dry and somewhat papery. A vague hint of grassy hops, fairly watery finish. Drinkable.
Paulaner Hefeweissbier Leicht;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Low Alcohol - Wheat;Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Drinking and enjoying this beer, at Munich, during a trip, in december 2018. The color is yellow/gold and troubled, light carbonation, white foam. It is not the most sexiest beer that I have drunk, during my life. It is aa hefe-weizen with less aromas, really watery, mineral, some wheat, little banana aroma and few hop, acceptable during the summer.

Kuhnhenn Belgian Amber;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap at Rattle for the Kuhnhenn takeover. Pours clear amber with a bit of white head. Aroma is caramel, malt, yeast, and a bit of hops. Dry, taste is pale malt and more caramel, light bitterness on the finish. Decent but nothing exceptional.
Kuhnhenn Belgian Amber;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Draft at RnH with Streets, Andrew, and Brendan during the Kuhnhenn Total Tap Takeover Event. I think this might have been listed as the SR Belgian. Not sure if this is the correct entry, but the notes arent very clear anyway. This was #29 and the last beer of an epic night. Pours a copper body with amazing aromas and flavors of wheat, yeast, toasty, fruit, almost salty.
Kuhnhenn Belgian Amber;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;The power of yeast: fruity indeed. Amber..no head. Butterscotch nose. Fall off the vine fruit and dried apricot. Strangly a tad cloying while also being dry. Finish and mouthfeel was crisp.
Kuhnhenn Belgian Amber;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Pours a clear crimson amber color, with lots of ruby tones when held up to the light. Thin ring of foam but solid, sturdy, webby lacing. Aroma more like a fruit wine than a beer - tart and alcoholic. Interesting mix of flavors - rich and malty with flavors of honeymalt and candi sugar. Tart and fruity with flavors of apple and cherry. I used to drink a combination of Red Zinger tea and apple juice, and the fruity aroma and flavors in this beer remind me of that. Delicious! A little bit of tannin in the finish, pleasantly tart aftertaste. Very smooth beer, medium carbonation. Way too easy to drink, and I don�t believe for a minute that it was only 5.5% abv. A couple glasses smacked me.
Kuhnhenn Belgian Amber;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap: Glowing ruby hue with a big creamy off-white head and outstanding lace which clings to the glassware. The aroma has notes of currant, cherry, anise, clover, heather, earthy and fruity yeast esters and a hint of oxidation (a good thing). Semi-sweet taste with ripened fruit and spice overtones. A bit bready and caramel is the background. Some woody notes on the finish and noticeable phenolic character. The feel is lush and sticky with moderate warming. Rocking and I really dig it, would drink it again and again.
Kuhnhenn Belgian Amber;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap. Deep brown with red highlights and very clear. Deep, dense tan head lasts until the last drop of liquid is gone. Aroma is fruity and sugary with lots of malt undertones. Medium bodied and smooth. A bit overmalted in flavor, lots of residual sugars remain. The yeast strain is interesting and does leave lots of fruit and ester in the flavor profile. Solid and different beer.
Kuhnhenn Belgian Amber;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap: dark amber with white film for head. Aroma was ll sweet malt with hints of peach. Flavor has alot of caramel and residuel belgian candy sugar taste, with a light fruity background. Decent overall, can see how sweetness would get to people though.
Kuhnhenn Belgian Amber;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;The body is dark amber. The aroma is mild cherries and sweet mead. The taste has cherries and some walnuts with a diacetyl finish. This also seemed a little salty.
Kuhnhenn Belgian Amber;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Maybe I just missed the point on this one. Clear sparkling amber, thin off white creamy head. The nose was loaded with sweet aromas of sugar coated sour peach and apricot. Flavor was just the same and begged to be called fuzzy fruit desert wine. Light bodied, light carbonation, drying, sweet fruity finish. Not my cup of tea at all, but luckily Kuhnhenn has about 12 other brews I love anyway....
Kuhnhenn Belgian Amber;Warren, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Draft... Lightly hazy orange ale with a large, creamy, off-white head. Good retention. Sweet, fruity aroma. Funky, tart flavor with some good, malty caramel and yeasty fruit. Medium-bodied and dry with moderate carbonation. Dry finish.
Kuhnhenn Belgian IPA;Warren, Michigan, United States;IPA;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap. Pours orange with medium white head. Clove hop aroma. Taste like a hefe mixed with a orange forward ipa

This beer is Retired? well maybe it goes by another name, but i have written down Belgian IPA in my notes. pours hazy orange with a hazy off-wthie head. pine, estery and lite earthy tones on the nose. wow, lots of pine and grapefruit on the flavors, at least cold. As it warmed, the belgian yeast character came out a bit more. long piney finish but not overly complex as a whole. the belgian yeast came out a bit with the pine in the finish. a very interesting twist to the style.

Kasztelanski Miod Dw�jniak;Bielsko Biala, Poland;Mead;TiM (Nectar Polska);Bottle sample at Nowina, pours a clear copper. Nose brings out intense bees wax, lots of alcohol, and treacly honey. Flavour is intense, with loads of treacly honey, bees wax, and alcohol. Hot but appropriately so. The honey intensity is phenomenal here. Wonderful.

Mi�d Pitny Tr�jniak Toporczyk;Tenczynek, Poland;Mead;Tenczynek;750ml bottle pours out golden no head. Nose is nice honey sweetness a bit of booze. Taste is more of the honey sweetness some bitterness almost. Not thick and rich like most mead.
Mi�d Pitny Tr�jniak Toporczyk;Tenczynek, Poland;Mead;Tenczynek;Bottle during RBWG. Pours a clear gold with small white head that diminishes to nothing. The aroma is booze and honey. Thin mouth, light honey, strong booze, decent but doesn�t hold up to better meads tried that day.

Mi�d Pitny Tr�jniak Toporczyk;Tenczynek, Poland;Mead;Tenczynek;Golden pour with watery head. Aroma is honey and abv. Thick honey and abv dominate. Full bodied and smooth.
Mi�d Pitny Tr�jniak Toporczyk;Tenczynek, Poland;Mead;Tenczynek;in short a very sweet mead with a slight sherry like aroma. a number of off flavors. not worth trying.
Mi�d Pitny Tr�jniak Toporczyk;Tenczynek, Poland;Mead;Tenczynek;Bottle, courtesy I believe of Frankenkitty. Sampled at Dark Lord Day 2007. Off notes in the aroma. Honey wine. Very pungent. Clear light gold body. Very sweet. Tastes cheap. Apple and apricot notes. Not a fine beverage. Not God awful but close. Drinkable only in the right situation...like when there is nothing else. The disparity in ratings between the first two and the last three, considering those from Cornfield, RAYBOY01 and myself were from the same bottle lead me to believe perhaps the bottle we had was infected, or old or otherwise different than what Otje and Frankenkitty had.
Mi�d Pitny Tr�jniak Toporczyk;Tenczynek, Poland;Mead;Tenczynek;Cheap alcohol stank coming off this abomination, which I later discovered was actually the highpoint of the drink. Big sugary syrup slap wraps itself around the tongue and palate and squeezes like an anaconda choking it�s prey, but both with less subtlety and mercy. This sticky medicinal mess was destined for the drain the moment it insinuated its sorry self in my craw, but I forced it down anyway...just because, dammit! And I will always be a little sorry about that.
Mi�d Pitny Tr�jniak Toporczyk;Tenczynek, Poland;Mead;Tenczynek;"Perhaps it�s because I had a Wild Blossom 2005 Sweet Desire shortly before drinking this, but this mead struck as as being ""off."" Deep yellow in color, it smelled of old honey, wax, plastic, and an odd sourness. It was thick and metallic on the tongue and tasted pretty much as it smelled. Off. Dark Lord Day 2007 at Three Floyds, Munster, IN, 4/28/2007."
Mi�d Pitny Tr�jniak Toporczyk;Tenczynek, Poland;Mead;Tenczynek;Ciderish in appearance... a deep, clear copper with a thick stickiness apparent when swirling. (No head nor carbonation, but we ARE talking about a mead here.) Cider comparison follows through to the aroma with sour apple and vinegar. Additional Bit O�Honey candy, brandy and bakery. Sweet, smooth and sticky with warming alcohol and apple on the backside. This is a mead to be savored in the cold months ahead. Bridgeview Liquors, Bridgeview, IL 60455

Fox & Hounds Redtail Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);This beer has a great aroma and has a unique taste. This is a type of Beer where you don�t have to put branches, or chocolate, or liquorice in the brew process to make it taste better. Different Brewer�s that sell this type of beer mix it to smooth out the taste and charge 11 dollars a pint. I prefer Fox and Hound and Clarks Crossing �Red tail Ale� and if I ever started my own micro brewery, I would try to emulate this fine beer.
Fox & Hounds Redtail Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);Definitely not 5 percent beer, and with a noxious and pungent aroma like sour apples. It tasted bad, but would have made a good cheap wine!
Fox & Hounds Redtail Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);Bottled in 1L PET bottle similar to the ones you see in Mr. Beer. Pours a light copper color with a modest white head that fades down very quickly. Aroma has a light butterscotch nose, light toasted notes, low earthy hops and a light vanilla-like finish. Licking the backside of a cow would taste better than this beer. A strong sweetness with notes of vanilla, sweet corn (DMS) and malt followed by a light toasted note that kinda lingers and finishes with a light earthy hops and sweetness. Body is extremely light, kinda slick with a low amount of carbonation. Overall a pretty poor brew. Flavors just don�t work very well and the beer as a whole reminds me of the crummy Mr. Beer beer. My new rule while in Canada, never drink beer that is found in 1L or 2L bottles as it�s generally pretty terrible.
Fox & Hounds Redtail Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);on tap at fox and hound, canton, ohio, nothing too special here, was served rather warm, some weak malts present,
Fox & Hounds Redtail Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);(Draught) Thin yellow head with a copper body. No carbonation. Nose is phenolic with a strong caramel malt odour. Flavour is initially tart, working into tones of mild malt. Rough stuff!
Fox & Hounds City Park Steam;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;California Common / Steam Beer;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);(Draught) Thin white, quick-dissipating head with a golden body. Nose of alcohol and nail polish. Smooth lemony flavour with a mildly tart finish. Reminds me more of a NY state Kolsch?
Fox & Hounds Prairie Pils;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);This had to be the worst brew pub beer I have ever consumed! Its taste was actually sickening. Of course, none of this establishments other beers were any better and I tried all four.
Fox & Hounds Prairie Pils;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);Pours a very clear golden color with low white head that quickly fades. Low carbonation doesn�t really add anything to the brew either. Aroma has a (not good) funky not, kinda grainy but more of an off metallic, fake vanilla nose. There is a very light graininess too and a faint grassy nose. Flavor is pretty dang bad. Strong astringent grainy flavor, very watered down toasted note, slight metallic flavor late in the sampling and finishes with a light vanilla note. Watery as all hell and almost no mouth feel as the 1L PET bottles don�t seem to hold the carbonation in that well. Overall a pretty poor tasting beer and definitely falls waaaay short of anything that would resemble a pilsner. Very very very bad.
Fox & Hounds Prairie Pils;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);(Draught) I must give credit to the waitress who strongly recommended not getting a sample of this beer. She said that it often tastes OFF and that people dont like it... so much so that she doesn�t even mention it to them while recounting the draught taps. Pours a lasting medium white frothy head with a clear gold body. Nose of wheat germ and mild lemon. Flavour is incredibly LACTIC and astringent. Terrible... terrible stuff!
Fox & Hounds Harvest Wheat Lager;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);this is THE most chuggable beer on the earth. it only comes in 1L bottles or on tap in the bar. its fantastic. go get really really drunk off malts!
Fox & Hounds Harvest Wheat Lager;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);Not a good beer by any stretch of the immagination. It�s carbonation was almost zero, and I doubt it rated anywhere near the 5% alchohol rating I was told about. The taste was bad, kind of like dry soap, and it left an extremely bitter after taste in my mouth that several glasses of pepsi could not wash out!
Fox & Hounds Harvest Wheat Lager;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);(Draught) Near headless beer with a light gold body. No nose. Mild lemony flavour with an astringent aftertaste.
Fox & Hounds Bridge City Brown;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Brown Ale;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);I�ve been drinking this for years b/c it is cheap. But in terms of Brown Ales it�s not well made. It hasn�t changed in years, and still contains the same huge diacytyl off flavour, as well as several other. The brewer should try to improve his process instead of sticking with mediocre quality.
Fox & Hounds Bridge City Brown;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Brown Ale;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);A Brown ale should have flavor. It should not taste like charcoal and have any trace of chemical odour. The appearance should be dark and heady, and the beer itself should have plenty of carbonation. This is what I expected when ordering a Bridge City Brown Ale fro The Fox & Hound Pub and Brewery. But this is not what I got. A glass of wasted money is the best description, and I seriously doubted their alcohol rating was accurate!
Fox & Hounds Bridge City Brown;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Brown Ale;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);(Draught) Lasting thin white head and a brown body. No carbonation. Roasted malt with good coffee tones in the aroma. Very coffee compared to Clarks Crossing brewpubs version. Good.
Fox & Hounds Raspberry Steam;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Fox & Hounds Brewpub (Malt House Brewing Co.);(Draught) White head with a pinkish hue. Orange-amber body. Lasting creamy head. Raspberry Jam nose and flavour which is pleasant. I can almost taste the Raspberry seeds. Above average.
Clarks Crossing Prairie Pils;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Clarks Crossing Brewpub;(Draught) Pours a thin white head and a light yellow body. Nose is mildly tart with lemon. Flavour is of nail polish, lemons and milk. Yuck!
Clarks Crossing Bridge City Brown;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Brown Ale;Clarks Crossing Brewpub;(Draught) Nice lacing. Thin white head with a copper body. On nitrogen? Caramel malt nose and flavour. Tart, phenolic and astringent. Thin... and bad. I�d rather be anywhere other than here to celebrate my 1600th beer... maybe I�ll pass the time in the toilette throwing up? Yah, that seems like a good idea.
Clarks Crossing Harvest Wheat Lager;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Clarks Crossing Brewpub;(Draught) Thin white head with gold body. Nose and flavour of Elastoplast bandages. Absolutely horrible... more horribLER than the rest. At least the waitress was cute and hung-out...
Sturgis Beer (1999 - 2004);Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;This tastes like a skunky schlitz. It has a metallic banana aftertaste. It is definitely a white trash beer, which means its right up my alley.
Manchester Raspberry-Apple Beer;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Manchester Bar & Grill;(Draught) I arrived when they just started a switch-over from beers to fruit beers. I don�t understand this city�s facination with Fruit Beers??? This one was poured from the Manchester Strong tap - it came out with an odd VIBRANT PINK head and a Kool-AID Fruit Punch body! I discussed with the bartender that I didn�t think it was and American Strong but he continued on believing. Then I smelt it... Artificial raspberries! The nose and flavour was initially sweet with a thin, mild maltiness to the finish. On nitrogen... though not smooth.
Manchester Apple Beer;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Manchester Bar & Grill;(Draught) Lasting, medium-white head with a light gold body. Grapefruit LIFESAVERS nose. Artificial fruitiness. Thin with a sweet finish. Is this a Canadian version of an alco-pop? Was this suppost to be Apple????
Specklebelly's Cream Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Cream Ale;Specklebelly's Brew Pub;(Draught) Thin white head with an orange body. No carbonation. Nose of spoiled milk and malt. Thin, tart with a mild malt finish.
Specklebelly's Mikes IPA;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;IPA;Specklebelly's Brew Pub;Pours like any pale lager. Piss yellow . Aroma is very dull. Some hops but mostly corn. Flavour is weak and offensive. This is the worst supposed IPA I have ever had. It is not bitter or hopy it is just another shitty pale lager. Its like the brewer said � I want to make a shittier version of keiths. This stuff is piss!!!!!!
Specklebelly's Mikes IPA;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;IPA;Specklebelly's Brew Pub;"I gotta give props to that description, I also hope its� demenour will make me content and happy. This one gets instant points for being from a particular brew pub that is both a nexus for white trash and close to my heart... Also, this seems to be a brew after my own shortcuts, albeit max shortcuts to the extreme. It smells like it was engineered to semll ok on the cheapest budget possible, non-offensive but also non-aromatic. I get watery yeast, I know there�s hops in there but it�s hiding... Pours with crazy macro lager overfill the glass head that dies to pretty good lacing, ok 1 more point for that. It tastes completely non-offensive, which is to say that there is malt and hops in it, but there sort of wishyt-washy like someone wearing a 46"" waist, they�re in there somewhere but you couuldn�t say exactly here, and don�t take the pound of flesh from there, cuz if they jiggle you might get it wrong. So if it�s warm it�d probly taste like shit, but it isn�t, so it�s ok. Again, it lasts for a bit of malty-hoppiness, but there�s really nothing there. Not bad, but not worth the trip, but since I used to live in the nieghbourhood... it has good memories."
Specklebelly's Mikes IPA;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;IPA;Specklebelly's Brew Pub;Sold in a can. Pours a very light yellow with a decent white frothy head. Aroma is very light with notes of pale malt, watered down lemon and a faint sour, wet hay note. Flavor starts off with dirty hay and malt note with a very faint watery lemon note to add to the overall light, water flavor of the beer. The brew has almost no density or any hop profile that is typical of an IPA and I would be hard pressed to put this down as an IPA but maybe a blonde or pale lager. Overall not a good brew but I think with a little more malt to add some density, it could become a semi-decent brew.
Specklebelly's Mikes IPA;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;IPA;Specklebelly's Brew Pub;(Draught) Nice white lacing with littly carbonation. Light yellow body and a nose of fruit and nail polish. Flowery hops with a mild malt finish. Definitely not an India Pale Ale...
Specklebelly's Honey Brown Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Brown Ale;Specklebelly's Brew Pub;(Draught) Thin white, lasting head and a golden body. Strong caramel malt and a maple syrup undertone. Very sweet with a tart finish. Subpar but perhaps the best mainstay on the tap line-up.
Specklebelly's Raspberry Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Specklebelly's Brew Pub;Excellent rasperry aroma, its just like the fruit. Reddish brown colour, not much head/lacing, but looks nice still. Great sweet malt that finishes with rasperry. It�s not a great beer, but it�s pretty good.
Specklebelly's Raspberry Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Specklebelly's Brew Pub;Pours clear redish brown with a nice head. Very strong raspberry aroma. Flavour is slighty tart and very fruity. the raspberry flavour is a little too strong. I could handle a stronger malt or a nice sour yeast flavour. but its pretty good. panty remover for sure.
Specklebelly's Raspberry Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Specklebelly's Brew Pub;Shared with JMerrit from a 2L bottle! Pours a deep fluorescent red/pink color that is reminiscent of cherry 7-up. Aroma is a strong raspberry aroma and is pretty similar to raspberry Lifesavers or bubble yum gum. Aroma is not off putting and was I was actually pretty excited to see what the flavor would hold. The flavor was absolutely awful. Very watered down raspberry flavor that fades very quickly, leaving only a very watered down grainy, hay flavor. Very light, highly carbonated brew with an overall fake fruit flavor. Never again will have this as I still have about 1.5 Ls to imbibe and I am almost 100% positive that it will turn my poo fluorescent pink!
Specklebelly's Raspberry Ale;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Specklebelly's Brew Pub;(Draught) Sadly - the best of the Speckleberry lot. Pinkish foamy head with a reddish pink body. Even the head looks artificial. The nose, however, is of Raspberry Jam. Slightly lactic and mildly tart - this raspberry ale is above average.
Specklebelly's Black Goose Stout;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Stout;Specklebelly's Brew Pub;(Draught) Lasting, foamy brown head with a near opaque body. Pleasant coffee nose. Nice texture - slightly gritty - with a mild sourness to send you home thinking. The coffee flavour finishes off the experience. A good example of a prairie stout.
Archers Autumn Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask at the Market Porter in London. Rusty amber. No head. Aroma is tea leaves, light hops, and watery malt. Taste is lightly floral with more tea notes, mild bitterness and a slight hint of apple. Body is relatively creamy and smooth but is a bit thin. Finishes with more light hops, mild fruit and tea.
Archers Autumn Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Archers (Evan Evans);One of Archers better efforts, in my view. Reddish brown colour. Roasted malt aroma. Nutty flavour, with plenty of hop character to provide balance. Dry malt finish, again with hops coming through to maintain the interest. A decent, autumnal ale. Cask (handpump), Market Porter, Southwark.
Archers Autumn Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Archers (Evan Evans);The DM & Hotstuff�s European Honeymoon trip beer number 10. This draft brew from the Market Porter in London poured a small head that left behind a poor lacing. The body was not noted. Its aroma contained notes of malt and hops . Its mouth feel was malty with a mellow palate and a flat hoppy aftertaste. Its flavor contained simple malty notes. Hey! AT least I wrote down more than SilkTork did at this point! Hehehe!
Archers Autumn Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Archers (Evan Evans);The Market Porter Gathering. Reddish tinge. Roasty notes. Slips down nice. Another decent enough Archers.
Archers Autumn Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask@The Market Porter, Southwark, London. Shares a similiar flavour to other Archers. This was quite smooth, orangey, tea-like hops, with some notes of caramel and cinamon (which spiesy actually pointed out to me).
Archers Autumn Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Deep amber coloured body topped with a frothy bone head. Slight bitter aroma fails to give away the massive malt complexity beneath. Carmel and coffee notes mingle at the heart of the beer. A very nice Archers indeed.
Archers Autumn Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Conditioned at The Bell, Banbury. Golden amber beer with white head. Fairly standard Archers bitter, juicy and full with a grainy slightly acidic note. Bitter on the finish, average fare.
Holsten Cooler Lemon;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Sweet artificial lemon taste with not much of any beer characteristics. Drinkable but a way too sweet.

Holsten Cooler Lemon;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);"Sorry for the german rating, but this is a lousy rating from my ""newbie"" time (2007-2009), and it�s not worth of being translated. I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! Beim Geruchstest kommen nur fruchtige Lemonaromen durch, von Bier NOCH keine Spur. Der Antrunk ist sch�n spritzig, gut rezent. Feines hopfiges Aroma im Antrunk, der Nachgeschmack wird sch�n fruchtig bitter. Ich muss zugeben: Das kann man wirklich gut trinken. Es wirkt fruchtig frisch, und die Hopfenaromen kommen auch noch gut durch� Eines der besseren Mixgetr�nke."
Holsten Cooler Lemon;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Clear golden with a tiny white head. Sweet aroma with lemons. Flavour had lemons, lime and malty notes. Finished sweet.
Holsten Cooler Lemon;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);A good light beer with a stench of lemon and summer. Drink this after doing sports or share with friends who likes a non-ordinary beer. Good stuff.
Holsten Cooler Lemon;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Very faint in lemon flavor, more of a regular beer, that would be ok, but the balance is just screwed up, even on a hot day, I�d go for a different brew/Radler
Holsten Cooler Lemon;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);<b>Bottle 33cl. @ [ Tasting by Maria ].</b><br />Clear light yellow color with a small to average, fizzy, fair lacing, mostly diminishing, white head.

Manos Gulo Gulo;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Manos Grill & Brewpub;Amber color...barely any head. Heavy on the carmel flavor but very thin. Not a drain-pour but dangerously close.
Manos Gulo Gulo;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Manos Grill & Brewpub;1L bottle. 6%. Minimal head. Amber colour. Very light thin molasses aroma. Flavour reminds me of a thin Rickards clone. Heavy on the caramel.
Manos Gulo Gulo;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Manos Grill & Brewpub;Darker amber beer with nice head retention. Faintly malty aroma. Sweet malt and decently hopped beer , with a nice caramel touch, and a lighter body. Still quite good.. I was scared about that one based on the Screamin Eagle, but it tunred out to be much more enjoyable. Canned. Where the hell did they get that name....sounds like a turkey. Gulo gulo! Gulo gulo!
Manos Gulo Gulo;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Manos Grill & Brewpub;(Can) Sampled at both the 8th Street and 22nd Street locations. In keeping with Manos Canadian Wildlife theme, Gulo Gulo is the scientific name of the Wolverine. This beer pours a frothy yellowish head with a highly carbonated body of orange-amber. No nose. Strong dark malt flavour with a mildly hoppy finish. Interesting but not worth the trip to either side of town.
Specklebelly's Apple Beer;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Specklebelly's Brew Pub;(Draught) Truly dreadful stuff. Large white foamy head with a lightly carbonated, light yellow... and a tinge of green body. Apples and maple syrup. Artificial MacIntosh apple flavour. I still shutter when I think about this beer...
McMenamins Argyle Rye;Portland, Oregon, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On tap at the John Barleycorns McMenamins. Pours a slightly hazy orange with a moderate white head. Slightly fruity and light malt aroma with citrus hops. Taste was very well balanced with a good rye taste up front then finishing with a good citrus hop aftertaste. Very smooth and crisp.
McMenamins Bricktop ESB;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Darker amber. Aroma has some floral and spicy notes, but also a very American feel to it. Not really true to the style. Not really bad, but far from great. Compared to the IPA and hammerhead, this was the worst of the 3 though.
McMenamins Bricktop ESB;Portland, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On tap at the Sunnyside McMenamins. Pours a darker orange/amber with a small off-white head. This brew had some good floral hops throughout but lacked a bit on the malt. Good bitterness to it but a bit unbalanced. Still smooth and very drinkable.
McMenamins Red Dwarf Kriek;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On tap at the John Barleycorns McMenamins. For a Kriek beer I thought this was great, I usually don�t really like fruit beers and the sour ones usually don�t rate all that well with me. This brew was very subtle with the fruit compared to other kriek beers i�ve had. Pours a hazy darker orange with a red hue, and a smooth off-white head from the nitro tap. Raspberry/ Apricot aroma with some nice floral hops alongside. Taste started slightly sweet with the fruit carring through till the finish and a great balance without a ton of sourness. Very smooth and drinkable.

Holdens Quarry Basher;Dudley, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Holdens Brewery;Golden bitter with the usual Holdens flavour - nutty malt, sweetness, almonds and rich fruit with a fresh hoppy, bitter character. Lovely stuff. (Cask at Tamworth beer festival)
Holdens Quarry Basher;Dudley, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Holdens Brewery;Melton Mowbray Fest O4. Clear amber in appearance. Aromas are toffee, fruit, spice and lots of hops. Flavours are toffee and caramel malts with kiwi fruit and grapefruit. Dry, bitter and hoppy with a fruity finish. Lip smackingly good.

Brunswick Black Sabbath;Derby, Derbyshire, England;Stout;Brunswick Brewing Co.;Hand-pulled half-pint in The Pheasant, Wellington Shropshire on 20th July 2019. Very dark brown body, beige top. Malty with a liquorice feel, some coffee flavours and esters too.
Brunswick Black Sabbath;Derby, Derbyshire, England;Stout;Brunswick Brewing Co.;Handpull cask at the Brunswick, Derby. Very dark brown, almost (but not quite) black. Uneven film of beige head. Aroma is resplendent with burned coffee, sweet liquorice, yeast extract. Sweet taste with liquorice in prominence, however there's a spicy/sour/savoury black pudding note nearer the long finish. A bit too much liquorice for my taste, but nonetheless a special beer. 378/
Laurelwood Fresh Hop 500 K�lsch;Portland, Oregon, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);Tasted at 2006 Portland Fresh Hop Fest--A summery and frangible feel with a taste bud anesthetic dynamic and hoprageous finish.
Laurelwood Fresh Hop 500 K�lsch;Portland, Oregon, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);Fresh Hop K�lsch on tap at their public house in Nob Hill. I asked for this one and I was handed a pint glass with beer that was ruby in color with a thin head (?). Anyway, tasted yeasty and hoppy with sort of a caramel popcorn undertone. I wonder if this was their ESB that was on seasonal tap before hand and they changed their signs before they could change their tap. Anyway, there�s no ESB under their profile so I�m posting this here for now until it�s updated or I find out more.
Laurelwood Fresh Hop 500 K�lsch;Portland, Oregon, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);They had the fresh hop on tap at the new Laurelwood on 51st and Sandy, this might not be the same as the 500 though. Pours soft gold color with a smooth white head. Big sweet hop nose, big citrus and resiny character. Taste was very bitter, a bit to much in my opinion for a fresh hop beer, the bitterness covered up the sweeter green hop taste.
Manos Malt Licker;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Malt Liquor;Manos Grill & Brewpub;"(Draught) Pours absolutely clear and colourless - like water! No detection of alcohol in the nose; perhaps a club soda and saki ordour. As it warms up a strange Bek Se Ju flavour becomes evident: boiled turnip and cashew wax. Not my idea of a beer but it was refreshing when served with ice and a twist of lemon..."
Shimane (Beer Hearn) Hefeweizen;Matsue-shi, Shimane Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Shimane Beer Co.;Pour: This pours a bright gold. It�s like a glass full of sunshine. Half-finger head. Color: Bright Whites. Bouquet: Light bright yeast. Creamy-sweet like apple blossom honey or mead. Sip: Creamy sweet yeasts explode and fade into a light citrus and vanilla. Hot grass and tart fruit round out the finish. Mouthfeel: Buttery, creamy. Light bodied, soft yet plentiful carbonation. Pairings: Great for Seafood and fish. I immediately thought of soft-shelled crab, crawfish, oysters, and clams. I had a poached salmon with a mango glaze that would pair nicely with this.
Shimane (Beer Hearn) Hefeweizen;Matsue-shi, Shimane Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Shimane Beer Co.;On tap at Kuunohanare, Nagaoka. Cloudy gold, creamy short-lived head. Tangy, yeasty aromas. Beautifully smooth and buttery, very subtle hints of coriander and banana. Delicious! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Shimane (Beer Hearn) Hefeweizen;Matsue-shi, Shimane Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Shimane Beer Co.;Can at 5.5%. Poured into a tall weizen glass it has a slightly hazy pale gold colour with two fingers tightly-packed bubble foam. Wheaty aroma, mild fruity esters. Light banana and wheat flavour, gentle spice, none of the bubblegum that often comes with local weizens, a light musty lager note in both aroma and flavour. It�s light-bodied, a touch too spritzy, something aqueous, like mineral water lingering. Not a very interesting weizen.
Shimane (Beer Hearn) Hefeweizen;Matsue-shi, Shimane Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Shimane Beer Co.;Draught at Keyaki 2014. quite fizzy, mostly banana flavor with a touch of vanilla. Average unimpressive weizen.

A very solid weizen, it poured with a nice white head over a cloudy gold body. The aroma is spicy & sweet and the flavor matches. One of the better weizens made in Japan I think.
Shimane (Beer Hearn) Hefeweizen;Matsue-shi, Shimane Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Shimane Beer Co.;Bottle from Tanakaya, Tokyo. Golden colour with a white head. Lemony aroma and flavour. A bit chemical.
Rogue Roguetoberfest;Newport, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rogue Ales;Draft shaker pint, at the Flying Saucer in Kansas City, Missouri. Pour is a clear golden with pretty much no head, what is there is off white. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, some muted toastiness. Faint nose. Taste is a nice mix of caramel maltiness and toastiness. All pretty mellow, nicely integrated. Nice beer, very drinkable.
Rogue Roguetoberfest;Newport, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rogue Ales;On tap at the flying saucer in KC. Pours a crisp and clear ambergold color with a fingerwidth, fluffy white head. Remains slightly lacy. Aroma of rich malts and Oktoberfest spices. Some breadlike notes and a nice hop backing. Crisp and caramel with a bit of floral tones. Taste is very similar. Breadlike and full bodied. Medium spicy and malty, slightly sweet caramel and fruit in there too. Not as spicy or hoppy as some of my favorite Oktoberfests, but a well crafted beer that was enjoyable.
Rogue Roguetoberfest;Newport, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rogue Ales;Comes out of the tap a beautiful clear honey-golden with a decent and attractive head. Aroma is crisp and fairly strong and richly malty with just a hint of fruit. Flavor is satisfying and malty and has a subtle fruity undertone. Texture is smooth and tingly. Not Rogue�s best, but worthy of them.
Rogue Roguetoberfest;Newport, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rogue Ales;I had this on tap at Sanctuary in Iowa City, it was called Rogue Oktoberfest, bu I assume that this was the beer. A dark gold to near amber colored body wth a light khaki head on top. The aroma was strong wit fresh bread and some caramel. There was also some almond nuttiness. The taste was toffee and light iced tea. A nice earthy finish with some carrots. Decent overall, but nothing special.
Rogue Roguetoberfest;Newport, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rogue Ales;Draught at Funky Buddha. Clear warm orange-amber with small head. Sweet malty aroma is bready. Smooth, clean mouthfeel. Very sweet, too sweet for me but has long body that ends in an acceptable level of sweetness. Sweet, sweet, and just drinkable.
Rogue Roguetoberfest;Newport, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rogue Ales;S on tap at El Bait Shop. Pours considerably lighter than most Oktoberfest beers, with a big fluffy head that sticks around and leaves lace. Aroma is slightly roasty with some decent hop floral aromas. Taste is considerably less roasty and hoppier than your usual Oktoberfest, but this does maintain the style with a light roasted malt dominated flavor. Some weird cardboard sort of thing going on, but it can easily be forgiven. Very smooth and easy to drink without a hint of the 7.5, in fact I was very surprised to see that number.
Rogue Roguetoberfest;Newport, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rogue Ales;From draught sample at Capone�s. Light malty sweet nose with neutral fruit and some orange essence. Mild grassy hops. Orange amber clear with thin lacing off-white head. Medium body with medium-high carbonation. Starts with nice malty character, toasted grain and a bit of acidity. Finishes with decent hoppy character and some subtle pilsner malt. Definitely the Rogue version of an Oktoberfest.
Rogue Roguetoberfest;Newport, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rogue Ales;On tap @ Coles Buffalo NY. Part of the Johns Locker Series. Pours a light & clean orange gold. Slight toasty bready aroma but not really much here. Taste has some caramel nuttiness to it. Lacking the smoothness that a heavier malt character would provide. Rather abrupt alcohol/ bitter bite. Disappointing
Rogue Roguetoberfest;Newport, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rogue Ales;Tap @ The Front Door: Pours a dark amber color with a nice head and light lacing. The nose has a slight adjunct nose with light lagery florals and a moderate alcohol note. The pacman yeast is a little lose on the style. Lacking the nutty and caramelly notes that make this type of beer. The alcohol bites through the tail with a slight plum and jammy note. I�ve always wanted to try this, now that I have, I�m sorry I did.
Rogue Roguetoberfest;Newport, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rogue Ales;Clear golden orange color poured on tap with almost none of the off-white foam left on top. Aroma is mostly bready with some caramel but a bitter hoppy bite as well. Toasty notes and caramel with an almost overpowering alcohol bite in the taste. The beer menu listed this as JLS Glen, the bar board listed it as Anniversary Oktoberfest. Hoping I�ve got the right beer.
