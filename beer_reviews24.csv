Jurand Premium;Warszawa             ,Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Barlan Beverages Group Sp. z.o.o.;"16.9oz bottle. Anything labeled ""Premium"" is gonna be sketchy. Filtered orange-yellow. Fluffy, soapy head. Off pungent Eastern-European factory swill aroma. Relatively straightorward trash Lager..A Pils? ..yeah right. Considering this beer probably costs like 17 cents in Poland, it�s tolerable. Sugary, extract tasting stuff. Some medium dark malt tones, reminiscent of that Mocne taste. Could actually get used to this one, not entirely reprehensible."
Jurand Premium;Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Barlan Beverages Group Sp. z.o.o.;Cool, has a serial number on the bottom of the label. Mine says brewed by Litowel Breweries. Big pour into a 22 oz glass mug. A little smell of somewhat veggie hops but in a pleasant way. Big white creamy head that fades to a blanket. Yep, its above 5% and tatses like it. Some shades of cheap american pale high gravity but that goes away at times. Has a somewhat acceptable sizzle on the palate, but that fades too as the session continues. Very nice lacing like a wet white wifebeater tanktop on rachel welch in the 1960�s. Not bad overall, never quite gets to american malt liqour attributes.
Jurand Premium;Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Barlan Beverages Group Sp. z.o.o.;500mL bottle, BB 11/12/10. Poured clear, bright golden with a short, tightly-bubbled white head. The aroma picked up honey and pale malts with just a little airy earth present.. some corn syrup as it warmed up. The flavor found honey and corny vegetal malts throughout.. sweeter honey was marginally tasty on the finish.. there was an element of dank on the middle that I couldn�t figure out.. OK overall. Light-bodied, dry, and grainy on the palate.. too syrupy to be refreshing.

Jurand Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Tried again recently and got pretty much the same result. A little less drinkable than I recalled. Original rating follows. Dark gold to light orange body with a lightly off white head. The aroma has some dusty hay and old library books. There is also some light apple behind the dusty character. The taste has some sweet potatoes and caramel. There is also some light would in the finish. A decent brew.
Jurand Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Single from Garys. Solid long lasting Head. Cloudy Golden Color. Malty as well as sweet. Very Full taste
Jurand Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Bottle: Bronze, light white head and light lacing. Nose of sweet Slavic malt and hops. The flavor is sweet, high alcohol and decently malted. Finishes sweet and malty. Meh. Your typical Slavic malt liquor.
Jurand Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Bottle: Pours a lighter amber/orange color with an average white head. Nose is sweet and malty, pretty standard for a lager. Taste is sweet and musty malt, as well as some grassy tones.
Jurand Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Nice amber color,small white head that had a good hang time then faded slowly to leave a decent lace behind.Very light aroma,light malt some sweetness and maybe a hint of citrus in there.The taste was malty with some mild hints of lemon and the hops come on fairly well in the middle and end with a mild hop bitterness.Not a bad brew,it has a slightly heavy middle to it but not bad at all.
Jurand Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Finally a Eastern European beer that I could finish. Not that it was good it just wasn�t horrible. Had a real funky nose that was skunky and like the smell of a unused ziplock baggy. actually quite refreshing but still has that underlying skunkiness.
Jurand Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;"Mid-golden with the light haze of microscopic particulate topped with a large, slow-fading, white head. Plastic in the aroma (think ""model car kit"") with herbs, cereal malts, fresh sawdust and a tinkle of pee. Sweet, corn-syrupy flavor with industrial gasoholic leanings leading the way to a dry, alcoholic finish. Sweetness lingers and I can�t decide if I like it. The punch of alcohol saves this one. Binnys Beverage Depot/DiCarlo�s Armanetti, Willowbrook, IL 60527"
Jurand Mocne;Olsztyn, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Warminsko-Mazurskie Jurand;Sweet malty aroma. Good label and bottle, lightly hazy honey gold beer with a big white head. Malty, just a little boozy, cakey at times. Not super bitter, but adequate hopping. Nothing fancy. Medium body, hop finish, loses CO2.
Otto�s Hefeweizen;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Pretty nice hefeweizen. Banana and a hint of clove in the right proportions. A nice summer beer. Murky orange pour with good head and lacing. Soft sweet finish. Tap at brewery.
Otto�s Hefeweizen;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Tap from the source. Hazy orange with a short white head. Not much in the nose, a bit more clove than banana in the mouth, touch gritty, half-sweet, low bitterness, low plastic astringency, strong carbonation with harshness but a little mineral in a medium-full body. Not great but fresh and I�d certainly order again. [2018.07.09: 2.9]
Otto�s Hefeweizen;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Otto's Pub and Brewery;"DATE REVIEWED: August 21, 2014... GLASSWARE: Weihenstaphaner weizen... OCCASION: catching up on some DVRs...APPEARANCE: dark copper body; very little effervescence; snow white head settles quickly to a sudsy, thin consistency; no lacing... AROMA: warm banana and aromatic bubblegum, with a hoppy citrus dimension; secondary scents like pepper and vanilla can be detected ... PALATE: intriguing balance of soft and strong--smooth mouthfeel but slightly heavier at the throat--revealing an ale character... TASTE: rather nondescript flavor, with lemon hints late and bubblegum, mint and grass--some malty sweetness too...OVERALL: bought as a bomber from the brewery itself, this brew compliments the humid August night well; an easy-drinking, tasty beer that I will seek out when returning to State College next summer...."
Otto�s Hefeweizen;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Transfer from BA review on 4-30-12 - Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance � Served a super hazy orange color with a nice billowy white head. The head faded relatively fast to give only a light amount of lacing. Smell � Big aromas of yeast and a wheat-bready smell are most dominant. There are also some nice aromas of orange, lemon, banana, and a little bit of spiciness mixed within. Taste � The taste has a very pleasing wheat backbone. The wheat bread taste is initially complemented with a good dose of yeast cake and some spice. The taste starts out more on the maltier side, but as the taste advances it sweetens as more citrus orange and lemon come to the forefront. Other fruit flavors of banana develop more toward the end. The spiciness intensifies again at the end and when mixed with the sweeter fruit flavors leaves a spicy sweet taste on the tongue. Mouthfeel � Medium to just a bit above medium in body thickness with a slightly higher than average level of carbonation. The lighter body and the higher carbonation complement the style well and make it a very drinkable brew. Overall � A wonderfully flavorful session brew. This is one I think Otto�s should put on their permanent roaster.
Otto�s Hefeweizen;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Otto's Pub and Brewery;WOW, one of the best beers I have had in a long time. Got this as a treat at a tasting. It reminded my of some beers brought back from Germany. Poured cloudy, with a nice white head. It had a nice banana and spice aroma and flavor. I can�t wait to visit State College!

Ottos Arthurs Robust Porter;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On cask at the brewery. Pours a hazed dark brown with a medium sized tan head. Soft sweet roast on the nose. Medium bodied, smooth with sweet roast, cocoa, chocolate and a touch of coffee. Lingering sweetness balanced with a good bit of dark chocolate.
Ottos Arthurs Robust Porter;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Transfer from BA review on 4-17-12 - Served on cask at the brewpub in a pint glass Appearance � The beer was served a deep brown color with a small tan head. The head faded rather fast giving very little lacing. Smell � The nose is quite light. There are hints of raosty malt with a very light coffee and chocolate aroma. Taste � The taste was of roasted malt up front. A dark bread mixed with a very light amount of roasted coffee and chocolate. There is a light sweetness of brown sugar and a very small amount of vanilla in the beginning and the middle of the taste. The flavors bitter more toward the end at the expense of the sweet, and leave a somewhat roasty and somewhat bitter flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel � A nice creamy body with a lighter level of carbonation. Very classic for a cask with some accentuation of the body. The creaminess complements the roasty flavors quite nicely. Overall � It was worth a try, but one I would likely not go back to any time soon. It had a very nice mouthfeel, but was pretty average in every other category.
Ottos Arthurs Robust Porter;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Well balanced good color, head retention. Flavor was moderate at beginning but fell off towards the end.
Ottos Arthurs Robust Porter;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Had on CasK @ Otto�s brewpub, in State College,PA - if you can find it.. . light casky mouth .. deep roast .. slick aftertaste .. . a perfect session brew but still, could be fuller- put this beer on nitro!! .. . . nothing but a few butterfly bandages won�t fix..
Ottos Arthurs Robust Porter;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Cask at brewpub. Pours black with a slow settling khaki head which leaves a fair amount of lacing in the glass. Nice malt and molasses on the nose. Mouthfeel is a bit thin as is the taste. Finishes clean. Solid but not as awesome as I�d hoped.
Ottos Arthurs Robust Porter;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Sampled on cask this beer poured a very dark brown color - almost black with a medium sized creamy brown head that lingered and left great lacing. The aroma was dry, roasty and woody. The flavor was bitter, dry and roasty with light notes of vanilla and wood. The finish was long, dry, roasty and woody. Medium body. Not my style.
Ottos Arthurs Robust Porter;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On cask at brewpub. Dark brown with half inch cream colored head. Aroma is nutty. Flavor is roasted nutty maltiness. Okay.
Ottos Arthurs Robust Porter;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On cask at Zeno�s Pub - State College, PA. Crisp, dry roasty nose with lots of charcoal, some cracked black pepper, and a hint of red wine. Pours rather dark black-brown with an off-white rim. Flavors are bristling with ultra-dry roast characters. Seems nearly stout like or very traditional London-style with an almost smoky edge. The malt base is exceedingly clean, allowing for a showcase of roasted and blackened characters. This beer really belches charred dryness. The cask presentation quiets the carbonic edge, which might get a little aggressive with this much roasted acidity in the beer. Fresh, prickly and with a nice roasted character that is unique and enjoyable.
Ottos Arthurs Robust Porter;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Cask at Otto�s. Very deep dark brown/almsot black with a frothy beige head and good lace. Aroma had lot sof chocolate malts with hints of roasted barley. Light hops all the way through for some balance, more chocolate in the middle, and a ligth bitterness in the end with hints of licorice. One of the smoothest porters I have had.
Ottos Arthurs Robust Porter;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Draft at State College. Deep burnt sienna with tan head. Aroma of dark malt, chocoff, some licorice and port. Tastes roasty malty, with finishing chocoff and molasses. Great balance and complexity.

Upland Winter Warmer;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Upland Brewing Company;Pours a deep golden brown from the bottle with fluffy tan head that leaves moderate lace. Aroma of musty earth, a hint of dark fruit, molasses and caramel, and booze. Taste follows, definitely big and warming, nice dark fruit and sweet maltiness, with a touch of earthy hop behind. Nicely done for a very uninteresting style, but a classic.
Upland Winter Warmer;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Upland Brewing Company;Pours clear caramel, minimal beige head. Aroma offers toasted malt and slightly tart fruit. Flavor features tropical and pomme fruit, toasted malt, sharp woody and caramel notes. Texture has fair fizz and OK body. Warm your winter.
Upland Winter Warmer;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Upland Brewing Company;"2007 bottle! Trade from Cornfield many years ago! I took in a nice nose of plum and brown sugar. The head does a very good job of staying in the glass; it's only lost half its height in the first ten minutes. The taste still has some hop bitterness. Maybe not that distinguishable, or else just using mostly English hops. Alcohol is very warming as I sip it. The malt has more caramel, and a bit of roast to it. There is a bit of the papery note of oxidation, but that can't be avoided with an 11-year old beer, especially at 9% abv. That one bit of off character is very mild, and does not distract from the experience of a beer made to lay down for, well, three presidential terms. As with many cellared beers, there are some dregs in the bottom of the glass of dead yeast or hop particles. Holding the last of it back, then swirling into my glass, didn't offer much that was different."
Upland Winter Warmer;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Upland Brewing Company;Bottle shared. Pours a clear amber with a finger of foam that dissipates. Prune and raisin driven nose with some light brandy like character and malt. Fruit forward with good malt character a touch of oxidation. A nice and smooth winter warmer that was nice shared amongst friends!
Upland Winter Warmer;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Upland Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a cloudy brown with small beige head that lasts. The aroma is bourbon and vanilla. Medium mouth, candy sugar, dark fruit, booze, sweet finish, very good.
Upland Winter Warmer;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Upland Brewing Company;650ml bottle. PRetty middle of the road barleywine, sweet caramel, missing some body.
Upland Winter Warmer;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Upland Brewing Company;Bottle at home. Pours a clear dark amber brown color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have some herbal hops sweet malts, caramel, leather, a moderate fruit character with a touch of bitterness to the finish. A touch on the thin side.
Upland Winter Warmer;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Upland Brewing Company;22 ounce bottle A bargain at $3.99 this was a decent barley wine with a Midwestern touch. Typical of many of the non-sour Upland beers it has some weaknesses. Overall though they are masked by a strong presence, great price, and well thought out winter warmer. Aroma / Appearance - The ruby red base is trapped under a bubbly head of foam. Musty leather, wet shoes after a winter hike, and sweet red vines tether it to the later months of the year. Hops are present but do not really take center stage. Flavor / Palate - Almonds, cherries, and fresh hops brighten the palate. Sweet aspects carry a chewy mouthfeel to a creamy and long lasting conclusion. A decent beer is slightly memorable and above average. At best though it makes a strong case for being a solid regional to fallback on when you get tired of Sun King, New Albanian, and other Indiana brands.
Upland Winter Warmer;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Upland Brewing Company;"Bottle; Pour is murky brown / mahogany with a two finger, fine bubbled khaki head into this glass. The nose is mineral, dark fruit, caramel and toffee, with a hint of grassy hops present here as well. The flavor profile is malt forward initial, blending somewhat messily with the dark fruits ; sugar plum moves to brown sugar , with some biscuit and grass present ; Its not very impressive honestly - but its not bad either."
Upland Winter Warmer;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Upland Brewing Company;I�m not the biggest fan of sweet, heavy beers, I don�t know, I guess I was in the mood. Pours reddish copper, with a ring of foam. Smells is lots of caramel, toffee, and molasses. Very smooth, slick palate. Taste is lots bready, toasty caramel and other sweet flavors. Nice bit of spruce and pine in the finish. I don�t know if I would drink all the time, but it hit the spot this time. BTW, the label says 8.5%, not 9...
Swan Select Chinook;West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Swan On The Green;"Cask, Swan Brewpub, Kent. Ginger orange colour. Malty sweet vinegary aroma. Crude. Taste is all over the place. Even the texture is unbalanced; watery in places, but mostly sticky sweet. Some obscure lemon flavour amongst mostly undeveloped malt. Dreadful stuff. No idea what style this is supposed to be - it's like nothing I've ever experienced before, or would want to ever again!"
Swan Trumpeter Best;West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Swan On The Green;Half pint pulled at th brew pub in West Peckham (Kent), amber with a creamy off white head.

Swan Trumpeter Best;West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Swan On The Green;Cask Conditioned at Oxford Beer Festival 04. A brown to amber bitter with light bubbly head. Hoppy sweet fragrant beer with a mid roasted malt base. A light enjoyable beer with sweet hoppy finish.
Swan Trumpeter Best;West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Swan On The Green;Cask, Swan Brewpub, Kent. Amber. Nice hoppy bitterness up front, crude orange flavoured malt in the middle. A confused mixture of the hops and malt in the finish.
Swan Bewick;West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Swan On The Green;Cask conditioned at The Kent Beer Fest, Canterbury. Amber to copper with slight white head. As with the other Swan beer at the festival, this has a big toffee caramel note, sweet and malty. A little sulpher, but rather thin.
Swan Bewick;West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Swan On The Green;Cask@Kent Beer Festival 2006. Hazy dark copper/nut brown, not much head. Nose has berries and barnyard (KBF was in cowshed, but this aroma came from beer). Fruity, malty and barnyardish! Not really hoppy, just some bitterness and alcohol in the aftertaste.
Swan Bewick;West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Swan On The Green;Cask @ 13th White Cliffs BF, Dover. 3 February, 2006 Sour aroma of sweaty feet... Candy and chocolate grows together with a slight lactic note. Malty toffiness ends this pleasant brew.
Swan Bewick;West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Swan On The Green;Cask handpull at Swan on the Green. Mid brown beer with disappearing beige head. Toffee malt and hop aromas, ok in the mouth with sweetish toffee and nice earthy dry hop finish
Swan Bewick;West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Swan On The Green;Dark chestnut brown colour. Slightly acidic, vinous, aroma with sweet malt, candy sugar and bubblegum nuances. Sweetish, fruity flavour with plenty of dry malt too and bitter coffee and sour undertones, but finishes quite soft and short of bite. Medium bodied. Quite complex, but lacks a bit of grip. A rather odd beer, but OK. Cask (gravity), Thurrock Beer Festival.
Swan Bewick;West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Swan On The Green;May, 2003 Swan Brewpub, Kent. The best of the Swan�s offerings. The Swan microbrewery opened in 2000 in a coal shed behind the pub. After almost three years of brewing it seems they still haven�t quite got everything right. I may have gone in on a bad day, but it must have been a seriously bad day for all six beers I tried to have the same taste of poor fermentation. Either they don�t really know what a good beer should taste like, or their yeast is very tired. Anyway, this teak colour brew was mostly successful and, given the poor quality of the previous 5, was actually quite tasty. There was a good depth of dry flavour with a firm texture. A bramble and alcohol warmth comes through in the finish. An overall leather flavour with just a hint of licorice, offset by a touch of immature development. There�s an old, slightly stale honeyed date in the aroma. [2.5] JUly, 2006Kent Beer Fest. Heavy. Intrusive sweetness. Quite rich and ripe. Noticable alcohol. Crude. Not good. Like a poor homebrew.

Jennings 175 Commemorative Ale (Bottle);Cockermouth, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Jennings Brewery (Marston's);Bottled, pasteurised, 500 ml. Copper coloured with white head. Sweetish full bodied special bitter, fruity malty with a biscuit edge, enough alcohol for interest and a hardy, floral hop note giving a decent finish. Enjoyable.
Jennings 175 Commemorative Ale (Bottle);Cockermouth, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Jennings Brewery (Marston's);Bottled. Deep clear mahogany colour, capped with a shinny, lacy white head. Slightly gaseous. Sweet, honey malt aroma with contrasting hop complexity. Lovely smooth malt flavour, biscuity and varied. Not challengingly complex but enough to keep you interested. In summary, it�s best described as a miniature version (just less of everything) of the Fullers Vintage Series.
Jennings 175 Commemorative Ale (Bottle);Cockermouth, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Jennings Brewery (Marston's);Not there best ale,quite an ordinary beer,hops and malt just don't stand out enough,a pity for a commemorative ale.
Jennings 175 Commemorative Ale (Bottle);Cockermouth, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Jennings Brewery (Marston's);Pateurised bottle. A pleasant, but very run of the mill bitter. Smooth and bland. On a par with Fullers ESB.

Jennings 175 Commemorative Ale (Bottle);Cockermouth, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Jennings Brewery (Marston's);Pleasant bronze appearance with several different tastes competing for your attention.But after the initial impact it settles down to be a fairly bland beer.After 175 years you would have thought that this brewery could have produced something a bit more exciting than this.
Jennings 175 Commemorative Ale (Bottle);Cockermouth, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Jennings Brewery (Marston's);Bottle. Nice bright copper bronze colour, thin white head and moderate condition. Low caramel malt aromas, malty in the mouth,slightly fruity with a good hop bitterness developing in the finish. Other than that, little in its favour.
Jennings 175 Commemorative Ale (Bottle);Cockermouth, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Jennings Brewery (Marston's);rich malty nose, dark bronze hue with a small white head, malty taste with bitter hop undertones, quite complex, some biscuity like notes, a worthy commerative ale (certainly not deletable)
Jennings 175 Commemorative Ale (Bottle);Cockermouth, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Jennings Brewery (Marston's);Malty nose with peachy hints. Rusty colour with a small head that vanishes quickly. Decent flavours or malt and caramel with a dry hoppy finish. Not Jennings finest effort.

Widmer Brothers O'Caseys Irish Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout - Dry;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Tap@Widmer.

Widmer Brothers O'Caseys Irish Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout - Dry;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);The bartender called this O'Caseys Irish Stout, and it is not actually a Widmer recipe, but is part of the Collaborator series of recipies from the Oregon Brewers Guild, a homebrew association. They hold regular contests, and the winners have batches of their brew made on Widmers premises, and put on a few local taps, including the Horsebrass Pub, and New Old Lompoc. Anyway, this was on nitro, so had a creamy long lasting head atop a black body, with a nice dry stout bitterness, a tad sweeter than Guinness. Actually quite good.
Widmer Brothers O'Caseys Irish Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout - Dry;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Good thick head that provided nice lacing all the way down. Very full bodied for a dry stout, hearty. However, the taste was somewhat lacking. Overall a good beer, much better than Guinness.
Dag Select Light Beer;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Not bad at all for a light beer. It's a sweetish, malty microbrew with more character than most light beers. Couldn't even tell it was a light beer.
Carolina Beer Co. Limerick Irish Red;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Carolina Beer Company;On draft at Carolina ale house. Nice clear reddish amber pour with Good off white head. Decent malty caramel notes but with a bright citrus hop character for balance. Pretty good and refreshing.
Carolina Beer Co. Limerick Irish Red;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Carolina Beer Company;On tap at Carolina Ale House. A run of the mill red ale that pairs well with pub grub. Easy drinking and balanced, but nothing stands out. Brewed for the masses, beer knurds should look elsewhere for flavor. Might be a good gateway beer. All that said, it is brewed skillfully and without flaws, and is a pretty reddish brown in the pint glass. -- rated with beerbasher/winphone
Carolina Beer Co. Limerick Irish Red;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Carolina Beer Company;"Draught at CAH under the name ""Ale House Red."" Pours a clear brown color with a slight red tinge. Nose is almost nonexistent. Taste has a bit of grains to it. Meh."

Carolina Beer Co. Limerick Irish Red;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Carolina Beer Company;6/9/10. On tap in the Charlotte airport. Orange-red pour. Generic malty beer aroma. The flavor is bread, crackers, some dry malts, and not much else. Not as bad as the brown, but not awesome.
Carolina Beer Co. Limerick Irish Red;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Carolina Beer Company;12 oz bottle from a coworkers beer of the month club. Poured a thin rust colored body with a tiny foamy whtie head. Aroma of sweet wet grains, caramel, toffee and maybe even a touch of raisin. The body is far to thin and watery with a light touch of carbonation. Flavor of super soggy grains, wet grass, rotting caramel. Blah.
Carolina Beer Co. Limerick Irish Red;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Carolina Beer Company;"Draft� This beer rocks!... Clear copper ale with a small, creamy, white head. Great, long-lasting retention. The aroma is simple, but fantastically malty � pure caramel and toasted malt. Medium-bodied with sparkling carbonation. The flavor is a direct reflection of the nose � sweet caramel and toasted malt with just enough bitterness to prevent sickly sweetness. Crisp, but malty, finish. Just the way I like it. This brew is just plain getting� it done for me. Can�t get enough. Reminiscent of the now-retired Lake Tahoe Crystal Bay Red Ale - RIP. Underrated... although I AM drinking this fresh; from clean draft line; and close to the source. Regardless, HUGE drinkability. World class malt bomb!"
Carolina Beer Co. Limerick Irish Red;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Carolina Beer Company;Red/amber pour into Sprecher pint glass.

Polnocny Polarne Super Mocne;Suwalki, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Polnocny;Rated: 29.07.2007 Can, 500 ml, 14.1 P Appearance: Initially head is fizzy, off-white, yellowish, no lacing, medium and very quickly disappearing, what lasts is only a grey ring around the walls of glass. Body is light amber, rather weak but still keeping the average level as for an Eurpoean Strong Lager. Body is clear, gently sparkling. Aroma: Apple juice, cheap plonk from apples, very weak aroma of honey, sweet, friuty, rotten apple, a hint of alcoholic nose and rotten wine grapes, form the aroma water seem to be of good quality but very heavy aroma. The warmer the beer is heavier and harder to nose, the beer is. Quite intensive aroma and like if the beer would be sweet with added extra sugar. Feaces and excrements are felt like from garden dump wase !!! Compost note is very considerable noticeable. Flavour: Makes your skin shiver and is all in all repulsive. Front is harsh alcoholic ans sweet (artificial sugar makes your mouth dry and parched). Your breath becomes skunky, after two or three small sips you can feel like having a strong hangover and being totally wasted. Flavuor of gone off, too fat sausage and old grease from whale or polar bear that is printed on the front of the can, very heavy, nasty body of the plonk is felt in your stomach like something undrinkable at all, motoroil I guess. I�ve vomited after 2 sips and after smelling this beer. Really! Toxic waste! Don�t aproach it! This is my third beer of that brewery and I am sure that they have real problems with brewing tehinques. Old, sweaty, greasy fur of a dog. Old oil, rape on your stomach. It tastes if somebody spit a loggie inside the glass. Plonk mixture of water and spirit! Palate: Body is medium, texture is wattery, oily, carbonation is rather flat. Finish feel is terrible, hangover, harsh alcoholic. I finally manage to drink the whole of it. Thank God it�s over.
Polnocny Polarne Super Mocne;Suwalki, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Polnocny;Bottle. Pours a particulate filled golden with disapearing white head. Aroma is of light caramel and lightly malty and buttery. Flavor is malty, buttery, and has a slight bitterness with a hint of hop oil. Medium bodied and fairly flat, this has a smoky and dry finish. Actually, very smoky. Not too bad considering the last two beers I�ve drunk from that same shelf at the liquor store.
Polnocny Polarne Super Mocne;Suwalki, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Polnocny;Canned. Deep golden colour. Frothy head. Papery, almondy aroma. Bock-like flavour with sweet maltiness and almond suggestions. Low on the hops. Medium bodied.
Polnocny Polarne Super Mocne;Suwalki, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Polnocny;Bottle. Pours a clear gold with hundreds of small particles surmounted by a thin white head. Sweet caramel with a touch of buttered popcorn in the aroma and taste, along with some vaguely herbal hops in there somewhere. Not a beer I�d buy again on purpose.
Polnocny Wigry;Suwalki, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Polnocny;No: 363 Pale yellow colour of the body, weak carbonation, mediocre white head, aroma is of sour, out of date barley and sourkraut, strong accidity mixed with rubber notes. Nasty and repulsive extremelly accidic, artificial flavour. I shared a can with Chmurarz and we weren�t able to drink the whole of it. Impression of raw rubber glue on palate. Yukkk...
Polnocny Wigry;Suwalki, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Polnocny;Bottled (BB 08/2005) Golden color, small white head. Mineral, malty nose. Malty, minerally but plain. Some diacetyl. Malty finish. Hides ABV quite well, but that�s all.
Kipling Light;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Intriged by the idea of a dark light I tried it. Fizzy, limp amber with no head and no depth. It was fine, but way past my price point. There is NO WAY I�ll pay $6 for a sixer of this.
Kipling Light;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);(bottle - 12 oz) Another one of those beers that I didn�t think was still being produced. Light amber color with a decent amount of fizzy white head. Aroma is a mix of malts, dry hops, boiled cabbage and sweat. Kind of heavy smelling. The taste began alright with a decent malt and hop taste but then the middle of it was kind of sweaty and greasy tasting. Very odd to explain, but it didn�t taste all that great. Kind of dry and a little bit sour with some malts near the end. Pass.
Kipling Light;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Kudos for looking marginally like a good beer and the malty palate. But too light overall with not enough going on.
Kipling Light;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Large amount of foam that did not stay long. Color was a trasparent brown/amber. Flavor of some hops with corn and malt. Smooth and very drinkable. Even though it�s dark, it�s still a thin light beer. Better than most lights.

Kipling Light;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);easy to drink, i could see drinking 12 or so at a time no problem, light but with superb flavor, very smooth yet dark, unique.
Kipling Light;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Light amber in color with a small white head.Hop and malt balance,but the hops are stale and lingering.The finish is very boring,nothing impressive.
Kipling Light;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Clear orange color with a virtually nonexistent head. Stale plastically aroma with hints of cardboard, thick but not good mouthfeel, sweet in a bad way in the ending.
Kipling Light;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Dark orange, almost red, deep for a light, medium quick-dying head. Nose very light, corny-sweet, inoffensive. Flavor/body buttery-smooth, maybe butterscotchy, but fairly bland; again, corn. No hops whatsoever. Above average for style."
Kipling Light;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Amber color. Lighter aroma of some wierd hops, maybe corn. Flavor was syrupy and finished with this odd roasty and grainy flavor. Good for a light, but it is still a light.
Flying Bison Barrel Roll Bock;Buffalo, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Bison Brewing;"Growler from the brewery. Apparently just a one-off this year, named ""Barrel Roll Maibock"" (slightly different title than above). Pours a golden/yellow with minimal head. Smells malty, with some straw/hay notes. Definitely some malt in the taste as well. Very smooth - this batch was listed at 7.2%+ ABV and you definitely don�t taste the alcohol content."
Flying Bison Barrel Roll Bock;Buffalo, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Bison Brewing;On tap at Coles, Buffalo NY. Pours a medium orange gold. Taste& aroma is fruity malts, caramel. Decent mouthfeel. Not bad
Flying Bison Barrel Roll Bock;Buffalo, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Bison Brewing;Draft at Laughlin�s. Poured light orange with a beige head. Malty aroma with a bit of caramel. Medium body. Flavor is similar to the aroma with maybe a hint of bread. Nice.
Flying Bison Barrel Roll Bock;Buffalo, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Bison Brewing;My favorite so far from Flying Bison. Great flavor that leaves you wanting more after each sip.
Flying Bison Barrel Roll Bock;Buffalo, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Bison Brewing;Tim hit a home run again. Recieved a growler full fresh from the brewery. Not much aroma, what is ther is a light spicy malt. Georgous light ruby hue. thin wispy head that cliongs nicely to the glass bu dissapates quickly, deep malt flavor wiht a touch of hop spicyness creeping in on the back of the palate. Just a touch on the thin side, but other wise a very good brew.
Flying Bison Barrel Roll Bock;Buffalo, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Bison Brewing;Which bock? Brewmaster said it�s been on since October. There certainly is no maibock called maibock. Even owner at annual Raceway brewfest could not describe it. Looked like a dopplebock, brown but with a thin head.
Flying Bison Barrel Roll Bock;Buffalo, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Bison Brewing;In a growler from the brewery. The color is a dark golden amber and the smell is dominated by a carmel tone. Sweet malts and more light carmel occupy the beer�s taste and there is also a nice bit of hops in it. A very good lager. A little flat but that could just be the growler. I will defenitly be filling my growler with this brew again.
Flying Bison Barrel Roll Bock;Buffalo, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Bison Brewing;Growler from Premier. I guess this was an old growler but it was chilled in the fridge so the age wasnt real noticable. Pours a clear deep gold/light amber with a nice fluffy white head and good lace. Aroma is light skunked hops, herbal and spicy upfront with a muted sweet malt background. Flavor was a little off- slightly harsh and skunked metallic hops with a light malt profile. Needs more malt presence and a sharp light munich bite to it. Ok, but I couldnt really finish the growler.
Flying Bison Barrel Roll Bock;Buffalo, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Bison Brewing;Draught pint at Cambridge Common on 4/29/06 Medium-high clarity in this deeply blonde beer, with some lightly baked straw notes and a hint of amber. White head is lightly creamy, medium in size and quite well retained for a draught beer, providing spotty lacing. Some sweaty hay, table sugar, and mildly spicy phenols (white pepper-like) are note initially in the nose, the pale malts coming off light, but fluffy, while the dry, hay-like hops add some complexity. Pepperiness on end nips at the nostrils, not too strongly and helps keep things in balance. Not really much in the way of heavy yeastiness or munich sourness (though there is a touch of light breadiness), more of a strong munich helles (but I guess that�s essentially what a blonde bock is, and who�s to say they need to use a large amount of munich malt). Some light creamy sweetness emerges as it warms, and the hops become a touch more crisp, still staying dry and straw/hay-like. Bits of fruit rise up as well, apricots, yellow-cherries and nectarines. Were it not for the crisp, clean yeast on the end (in the flavor) it would almost seem more like an ale yeast fermented at low temps. The flavor is spicy again, leading to an almost perceived roastiness, though it quickly sinks in to the creamy, honey-rich maltiness, not heavily thick, but definitely notable of a long boil, with some preliminary caramel notes. Soft, moderate to low carbonation is not intrusive, but helps mitigate the sweetness. Light bock-like melanoidins and a touch of sourness, but it�s a very easygoing bock. Phenols are a touch heavy on the finish, as it warms, combining with some dry breadiness, and it begins to overpower the malt, but the carbonation helps keep things fairly well cleansed. I didn�t note any alcohol in aroma or flavor.
Flying Bison Barrel Roll Bock;Buffalo, New York, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Bison Brewing;Tap at Coles. Poured a clear light brown/copper color with a small bubbly head. Caramel, cherry aroma. Sweet, earthy chocolate flavors. Some good caramel and sugary hints. A lighter bodied, lightly malted bock than I expected but still a solid beer.
Flying Bison Buffalo Destroyers Brew;Buffalo, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Flying Bison Brewing;A special beer brewed for indoor football that has been kept as a secondary offering. Looks and tastes like rootbeer. Soapy suds. Very easy drinkable
Flying Bison Buffalo Destroyers Brew;Buffalo, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Flying Bison Brewing;Brown color, big tan head. Nutty aroma, some malt as well. Flavor was kind of earthy, a little nutty. A little thin. Decent.
Flying Bison Buffalo Destroyers Brew;Buffalo, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Flying Bison Brewing;The Destroyers are the local arena football team. I have to admit I never understood that sport. Light caramelly brown colour. Nutty aroma with wood notes. Watery body (I was warned this was a Newcastle clone). Hints of nuts, fruit.
Turonis Maibock;Evansville, Indiana, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Turonis Pizzery / Main Street Brewery;Lightly hazed pumpkin shade. Quick, off white foam. Subtle aroma of hazelnut overtones, faintly hayish tinge, soft, spicy hops, caramel, raw malt toastiness, apple, and estery yeast flares. Gently carbonated, round mouthfeel. Moderately acidic flavors are proceeded my earthy flavors, Northern Brewer/Styrian-like round juiciness, walnut skin, and plum-like graininess. Finishes with a trace of yam, pale malt (most likely Munich), and cracker. Overall, too acidic and lacking the proper malt depth. Still, a noteworthy, locally produced Maibock.

Kr�ger Export Beer;Leuven, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);330 ml. bottle sampled @ home. BBF 25.11.2016. Sparkling clear industrial, looks suited for a commercial, industrial white head that is quickly gone. Smell is overly sweet cooked vegetables, vegetable oil, sweet plastic, nasty, industrial,� Taste is plaster, cooked vegetables, massive vegetable oil, corn, oily stale grains, faint cooking oil bitterness, grains. Watery industrial body. Cheap industrial affair, not good but not that terrible either. I wonder where they export this one to, ingredients are listed only in Dutch & French. Fine I suppose if you are looking to drinks some very cheap pale lager.
Kr�ger Export Beer;Leuven, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Bottle 0,33 ltr: Clear golden colored brew with an adequate sweet bitter taste. Another remnant of an InBev hostile takeover brand.
Kr�ger Export Beer;Leuven, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);33cl bottle at home in the early hours of 7th Dec 2015. Light golden body, bright and clear: on top a deep white head. Almost odourless, maybe a grain/malt ester or two. Taste is leaning towards sweetness with a malty lead, but not much going on really. Bog standard European Lager/Pilsner: refreshing but lacking character or real flavour. I wonder where they export this beer too? I bought mine in Belgium.
Kr�ger Export Beer;Leuven, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Bottle at JH Ekseekwo. As an alternative to the Jupiler Crap I've been drinking all night. Too bad this is even worse. Smells like dog piss, drinks like a sugared version of Jupiler. Truly horrendous. People in this place seem to think it's cool to drink this, because it's something else but obviously they have no clue whatsoever.
Kr�ger Export Beer;Leuven, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);"33cl bottles on repeated unguarded instances in Meetjesland watering holes, plus consciously at Biermuseum, Ertvelde 2013. As remarked below, this ""etikettenbier""/commissioned beer�s primary function is regional nostalgia for a now defunct brewery, and with it, the whole style of the (Belgian) Export, a once popular German import. Beneath the 70s label is: a none too clean, none too flavourful grain-amped and possibly corn/mais/rice-aided lager, which settles for tired cardboard-sweet malts carrying generic grassy hop bitterness stopping miles short of BE-pils bitter. Sticky edges, metallic body. A bit of a regional joke by InBev, though not too offensive to the non-sensitive palate."
Kr�ger Export Beer;Leuven, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);33 cl bottle at home. Drank on January 2nd 2015 as Kr�ger Export Beer (4,8%).
Kr�ger Export Beer;Leuven, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);"One of those remnants of the Interbrew era, when local brands were bought only to keep them artificially alive in order to keep their faithful audience paying for them. This was, and is still, very popular in Eeklo, where the original brewery, which also produced stout among other beers, was located. It is an �export� in the Belgian sense of the word: standard lager in bottles of 33 cl. The beer itself is okay, with sweet pale malts, light golden colour and stable snow white head, and grassy hops in the finish; but it is still a boring mass-produced pale lager."
Kr�ger Export Beer;Leuven, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Mijn favoriete bier om door te drinken. Het zit grotendeels tussen de oren, daarvan ben ik mij bewust.
Chumleys Wing And A Prayer Wheat;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Chumleys;Tap @ Chumleys. Blonde color with a thin white head. MIldly hoppy with not very much wheat or yeast in the flavor. Watery without the chewy palate of typical wheat beers. I could do this as a session beer, but I�d rather drink something better.
Chumleys Wing And A Prayer Wheat;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Chumleys;WOW I just foudn this rating from back in December! Had this at Chumleys in the village. not very strong flavors, and VERY thin for a wheat brew... i was not impressed. no fruity flavors really. thin look, not cloudy like i expect from a wheat, with thin lacy head. i am making a weird face remembering it.
Chumleys Wing And A Prayer Wheat;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Chumleys;Draught at Chumley�s, West Village, New York. Blond weisse style beers with a lacy white head. This beer lacks many of the strong sharp features of its European forbearers but is easy drinking. Served slightly too cold but still plenty drinkable.
Chumleys Wing And A Prayer Wheat;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Chumleys;A rather metallic wheat lacking in wheatiness. Surprisingly hoppy and slightly dry. A huge disappointment. Contract-brewed by Chelsea Brewing.
Chumleys Labrador Lager;New York, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Chumleys;Hokay last of the list I found from eons ago. This was REAL thin (seems to be an attribute of this brewer) and was almost like swillin. didnt expect THAT when i paid $5 for a tiny ass glass... well, whatev...
Chumleys Labrador Lager;New York, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Chumleys;Just terrible. A Budweiser clone. Fizzy and replicating the oft-maligned American Standard style. Avoid.
Chumleys Sunrise Rye;New York, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Chumleys;So I've just realized that I live pretty close to Chumley's and I had a hunch that their beer would be unremarkable since people go for Chumley's history and atmosphere, not its beer.The Sunrise Rye was more refreshing and less hoppy than the Wing and a Prayer Wheat. Slightly sweet and oddly fruity (just a touch). Best of the lousy beers I've tried at Chumley's today.
Chumleys Blackberry Wheat;New York, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Chumleys;As I sit in this 1920's-era former speakeasy, I feel charitable. So generous is my mood, I can almost forgive this Godawful beer I'm drinking. If it didn't say Blackberry on the tap, I'm not sure I'd really believe it has any fruit in it whatsoever. There's barely a whiff of berry and virtually no taste. Copper-colored.
Southampton Imperial Porter;Southampton, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;Poured into a snifter, the appearance was a dark brown color with a foamy eggshell white colored head. Nice speckled lace. The aroma had some caramel and roasted malts, touch of sugar. The flavor was basically the same with some burnt toast to it. Sweet malty to almost sugary aftertaste. Quick sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Low carbonation. Pretty smooth along my tongue. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, I can see it as suggested by the brewer, but did it really come together as expected? In my opinion, not as much. It wasn�t bad, it just seemed to lean sweeter than I had hoped for.
Southampton Imperial Porter;Southampton, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;Sampled at Big Brew Beer Festival (Morristown). Poured a dark brown color with a foamy khaki colored head. Aroma or caramel and roasted malts. Taste was the same, with a bit of burnt toast in the finish.
Southampton Imperial Porter;Southampton, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;THis is a drinkable porter. I found it to have good balanced flavors, but it is a bit thin and the after taste is lacking. I could drink this, but I probably will not buy it again.
Southampton Imperial Porter;Southampton, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with a 1/2"" tan head. Minimal lace. Subtle chocolate and coffee aroma. Smooth, soft palate with little carbonation. Goes down like silk. Flavor is chocolate with roasted malt with a hint of coffee. Maybe a little hop in the finish. Nice, solid porter."
Southampton Imperial Porter;Southampton, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;Sampled at High Street Grill Winter Beer Fest. Very nice porter to say the least. Pours black with a tan head. Full bodied with a nicely roasted malt, coffee flavor. Finishes very refreshing for the style. A pub I got to get to soon.
Southampton Imperial Porter;Southampton, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;On tap at Rattle n Hum. Pretty tart for a porter, without much smoke or coffee flavor. Could this have been a little bit off? It was still a good pint.
Southampton Imperial Porter;Southampton, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;Novare Res Portland ME. Draught. Decent but lacking in head retention. maybe its their lines? Decent porter but not earth shattering
Southampton Imperial Porter;Southampton, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;good bu tnot great...black and a little mediciny...not a heavy pour...sweet and thick...
Southampton Imperial Porter;Southampton, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;Black with a long lasting sandy head. Smells of paint. Tastes like roasted chocolate and cough syrup. Didn�t enjoy this too much. Sampled on tap at Perly�s Bakery in Easton, PA.
Southampton Imperial Porter;Southampton, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Southampton Publick House;On-tap at the Publick House 8-07. Pours pitch black. Tan head. Malty nose with coffee tones. Flavor is heavy on coffee. Thick malts. Feel has a good carbonation and a nice thick liquid feel. Very drinkable. A nice hearty and robust brew. Well worth a try and pretty damn good as well.
Stockyard Oatmeal Stout;Monrovia, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);It starts off tasting okay but leaves a lingering aftertaste of syrup that makes the whole thing taste artificial. Definitely not worth it, even for the cheap price.
Stockyard Oatmeal Stout;Monrovia, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottle. Blackish beer with a brown head. Chocolate and light roast aroma. Chocolate and coffee flavor with roast. Medium bodied. Chocolate and coffee linger with roast and light fruitiness.
Stockyard Oatmeal Stout;Monrovia, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Black with thin tan head. Aroma has toffee and sweet malt. Taste is sweet, malty and a little creamy. Has a little vanilla. Ok considering the price but kind of dull.
Stockyard Oatmeal Stout;Monrovia, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Pours near black with a tiny beige head. Aroma has roasted malts, molasses, hints of cocoa, and dark fruit. Taste is heavy in molasses with some decent toasty notes. Too sweet and syrupy for a stout. Wish it had more coffee bitterness. Would not buy again.
Stockyard Oatmeal Stout;Monrovia, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Too basic, very one note. Can do a lot better in the stout realm. Doesn't matter if you only spend $1.09 per bottle. This should be for large parties only. Not worth drinking on your own. Aroma is malty and enticing. Appearance is near black and does look appealing. Medium tan head. Taste is initially sweet malt that gives way to a one-note sourness all too quickly and that's all that is left. Not a great flavor to end on. Makes you want to take another swig so the aftertaste goes away.
Stockyard Oatmeal Stout;Monrovia, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Pours dark brown, almost black with a fluffy creme colored head. Aroma of dry malt. Initial taste is of toasted malt with smoked influences as it moves along the tongue. Palate is dominated by dry malt with a dry rice/malt element on the back of the tongue. Pretty good.
Stockyard Oatmeal Stout;Monrovia, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Nice unassuming stout, light chocolate, roasty, coffee aroma and flavor. Rounded mouthfeel. Okay beer.
Stockyard Oatmeal Stout;Monrovia, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);bottled - very dark, almost black appearance. Sweet roasted chocolate aroma. Decent sweet chocolatey stout flavor.
Stockyard Oatmeal Stout;Monrovia, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);12 oz bottle from Trader Joe�s, poured into a pint glass. Black pour with a khaki head, long lasting lacing. Mild roast and coffee with a little chocolate, some dark fruit and a hint of molasses. Medium body, would recommend to friends!
Stockyard Oatmeal Stout;Monrovia, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);A steady poor produces a three-finger thick, light brown tinged, dark tan colored head. The beer is a rich dark chocolate color that shows a brilliantly clear, gem toned Brown color when held up to the light. The aroma smells of toasted whole grain, brown bread with a bit of a roasted Edge to it. There is a touch of burnt fruit underneath as well, and also a brown malt caramelized character. The body has a solid viscous texture to it that gives us beer a medium mouthfeel that is not heavy, but is still nicely chewy. Sweet dark malt flavors are balanced by a burnt and roasted grain character that lingers in a long finish. Flavors of cocoa, milk chocolate, and rounded, lightly roasted, smooth coffee also play a prominent role here. There is a burnt bitterness to the Finish, which also helps to nicely balanced the soft dark malt sweetness that is found here. There is a soft buttery note here that melts in well with the dark chocolate and dark malt character. This is a really nice beer, especially for the price. I think this may become a regular thing that is stocked in my beer fridge for when I want something chewy and roasted.
Oakham Kaleidascope;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oakham Ales;Cask, gravity at The Pig �n� Falcon, Cambridgeshire. Dark brown. Leafy hop aroma. Grapefruity taste with a curious hint of match head. Mid bitter finish. Not particularly kaleidoscopic, but quite quirky and enjoyable.
Oakham Kaleidascope;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oakham Ales;Cask, The Tap, peterborough. Deep ruby haloed with white. Sweaty alpha nose dusted with coffee and signature grapefruit hoppage. Lingering husky bitterness mingling with subtle coffee, choc and faint dankness splashes. Splinter of rummy cask wood, quite aggresive hop punchiness again, hint of strawberry. Soapy grower balanced out nicely with chocolate and nuts, and a more complex malt profile than is typical from Oakham.
Oakham Kaleidascope;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oakham Ales;Cask (Pullman, Helsinki) More an Old Ale than an ESB. Dark brown, thin head. Mellow dark malts and fruits in the aroma, but with a reasonable hoppy bent too. Taste matches that, full bodied, woody and fruity. Yet another classic from Oakham.
Oakham Kaleidascope;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oakham Ales;Cask, Leicester Fest 06. Dark brown with big bubbles. Aromas are very herbal with sweet spices, ginger and aniseed. Flavours are herbal and spicy with lots of bitterness following. Quite floral and earth in its hopping. Root vegetables and tea notes are also present. Dry and bitter on the finish. Pretty good.

Cask Stillage at the Formby Hall, Atherton 30/01/2003 Copper mid brown coloured with a hint of ginger. Slightly dry finish. 2.

Oakham Kaleidascope;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oakham Ales;Hand pulled at the Bartons Arms, Birmingham. Copper coloured, with a loosely frothed head. Nice deep, boiled hop aroma, which carries through into the taste. A rich flavour, mouth-filling and lengthy. Crisp hops, wrapped in soft veg and sweetness. A hard edge too with a deal of bitterness. Boring to say, but it�s another excellent beer from Oakham.
Oakham Kaleidascope;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oakham Ales;Cask @ Angleterre, Helsinki Finland Backlog 1 April, 2005 Mahogany colour. Chocolate and dark fruits in aroma as well as taste. Reliable bitter aftertaste.

Heritage IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;A rather mild interpretation of an IPA. Low bitterness for the style, using Bullion hops. Needs more oomph!
Branscombe Vale Summa That;Seaton, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Branscombe Vale Brewery;"Cask. Brewer's description: ""...clean..."" uh huh, it's so clean it's cleaned out. The smell is VERY slightly malty, the taste is MILDLY malty - and that's it. Not even the usual amount of filler malt that I always complain about. Doubtful that this brew has had any sort of hop waved in its direction either. Waste of money, time, taste buds. It's like drinking ghosts. Not even a beer for teenage trainee drinkers. Edit: finished the pint, is there any way to score it sub-zero? Awarded Winner, Most Pathetic Brew of the Year."
Branscombe Vale Summa That;Seaton, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Branscombe Vale Brewery;500ml bottle from Barley Mow�s taken in the van at Ilminster. Solid rustic gold, if a notch over-fizzed. Veiled with a huge rocky bloom of suds. Tenacious, too. Backbone of clean toasty pale malt with a linger of unsalted peanut. Grassy and noncommittal citrus over the top. Aroma of lemon sherbets and green herb citrus.
Branscombe Vale Summa That;Seaton, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Branscombe Vale Brewery;Half pint, cask at Mermaid. Filmy layer, clingy lacing, near clear golden-brown body. Ripe fruity nose, mid-sweet. Taste of ripe fruits with banana sweetness. Rounded mid-sweet ending. Easy to drink. Quite alright. (Shared with Finn, St Albans 27.09.2018).
Branscombe Vale Summa That;Seaton, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Branscombe Vale Brewery;"Cask at the Bell, Waltham St Lawrence. An attractive pale amber pour with a tight white head; floral aroma; dry floral taste with a lasting herbal bitterness. A straightforward, very drinkable blonde ale, showing that good summer beers don't have to taste of citrus."
Branscombe Vale Summa That;Seaton, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Branscombe Vale Brewery;Cask (5%), 1/2 pint by hand-pump at The Bon Accord, Glasgow on 24 May 2018: caramel, grain aroma and flavour, golden, good white head, irregular lacing, creamy.

Branscombe Vale Summa That;Seaton, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Branscombe Vale Brewery;Bottle at The Shed, Seaton. Huge aroma of apple cider (appley) with decent appearance, fitting profile for the area. Taste is of apple cider and a slight malt vinegar. Palate is a but pub floor but very quaffable. Really enjoyed this one, very fresh! 8-4-7-3-15 Bottle at home from shop in Beer. Same as above with slightly fresher palate but more see through and less special (occasion I suppose). 8-5-6-3-14
Branscombe Vale Summa That;Seaton, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Branscombe Vale Brewery;Bottle from Woods Village Store, Colaton Raleigh. Amber with a small glow and a very thin head. Has a surprisingly light drinking texture for its strength, almost (but not quite) thin tasting, with a pleasant fruitiness in both aroma and taste.
Branscombe Vale Summa That;Seaton, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Branscombe Vale Brewery;Sampled from a bottle purchased at Dunster Deli. Hazy golden colour with a thin white head. Rather undercarbonated. Aroma of ripe banana, surprisingly. Taste is of malt, ripe banana, mango and peach. Is wheat used in this brew? Certainly tastes like it. Very nice, but a little thin considering the ABV of 5%.
Branscombe Vale Summa That;Seaton, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Branscombe Vale Brewery;Bottle. Golden with a small head.Some hops with a gentle spiciness Distinct lack of body is a downside especially considering its reasonable strength. Bit of a let down..
Lindeboom Geuldal;Neer, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Lindeboom Bierbrouwerij;"Honey, sweet aroma. Pilsenerlooks, bit darker; clear golden/yellow coloured. diminishing head. Taste is sweet, watery, hoppy and some fruits. Soft bitter palate."
Steffl Bier;Sopron, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Hung�ria/Soprony Brewery;Average beer when chilled, but warms up very quick and ruins the whole drink. The drink had quite a bitter taste and was made worse with it being warm. Very basic beer again.
Chumleys Eagle Pilsner;New York, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Chumleys;This beer is immensely mild and forgettable. I wish I'd had it side-by-side with Chumley's Labrador Lager so I could see which was blander and more Bud-like. Very little malt flavor, and reminiscent of a light beer. It's only saving grace is that it's not overcarbonated.
Chumleys Bulldog Bitter;New York, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chumleys;On tap at the restaurant. Great, interesting, historic location. Beer itself was a pretty straight forward bitter. Didn�t offend, and complemented the burger nicely.
Chumleys Bulldog Bitter;New York, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chumleys;Draught at the brewpub Amber color. Light caramel aroma. Some flavor of caramel and toffee and butter. Ordinary.
Chumleys Bulldog Bitter;New York, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chumleys;Bottled, at Chumley�s, NY. Crystal clear amber colour with an attractive lacy bone head. A little thin an not as bitter as I�m used to in the UK.
Chumleys Bulldog Bitter;New York, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chumleys;"Like a bulldog, this ""bitter"" took a bite out of my esophagus with its strong hop body and penetrating wallop of bitterness. More like an IPA, really. Oh yeah, decent head with a copper body, but who really cares about that stuff."
Chumleys Captain Drennans Irish Red;New York, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Chumleys;"Draught at the brewpub Amber color; thin head. The aroma shows some good malt and hop. Some malt taste, a bit weak, a lot of caramel and a strong hopping, partially aromatic and resiny."
Chumleys Captain Drennans Irish Red;New York, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Chumleys;Lacy head with sour smell, REALLLY thin, and not much flavor. easy to drink but not as enjoyable as it should have been
Chumleys Captain Drennans Irish Red;New York, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Chumleys;Draught, at the Chumley�s, NY. Amber with a reddish hue. Decent lacy head. Rather sharp & cold. Not so much body, flavour or aroma as we�ve been having but drinkable. Thin but drinkable is the final consensus.
Chumleys Captain Drennans Irish Red;New York, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Chumleys;Perhaps one's best choice when sitting in Chumley's is to order a pint o' the Drennan's Red (a better alternative is leaving altogether and walking three blocks to the Blind Tiger Ale House, but let's assume you're unable to leave because you've broken a leg skiing or you can't find the door in this hidden, remote 1920s speakeasy). Anyway, the Red is a decent amber ale with considerably more malt than their Bulldog Bitter and less hoppiness. That makes it a slightly underhopped amber with much more chocolate undertones than you might expect.
Chumleys Iron Heart Stout;New York, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chumleys;Draught a hell of a long time ago, but like everybody else said, this was a thin stout and nothing special, but you were drinking it at Chumley�s, which was an incredibly special spot.
Chumleys Iron Heart Stout;New York, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chumleys;Blackish brown pour. Nitro head. Nitro taste and aromas. Silky nose...at first. slightly sweet with a pungent tart sourness. This then turns into nothing but water. Nothing but water. Nothing else. Chalkiness. Flavors are immediately tart and sour, not much sweetness, maybe some in a cane sugar sort of way but nothing in the way of roasty sweetness. Dry chalkiness and then water. Silky again and then nothing but water. Pretty thin beer.Looks great though.
Chumleys Iron Heart Stout;New York, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chumleys;big thanks to Connie and Michelle for introducing me to this place - - it�s a real speakeasy in Greenwich Village from the prohibition era - there�s not even a sign in front of the bar!! black opaque body, dark tan thin & short foamy head. edges are lighter brown in color. aroma is roasted malt and a little nutty, flavor is light but not too watery. starts roasted malt but has some caramel malt in the middle, then gets roasty again in the finish.
Chumleys Iron Heart Stout;New York, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chumleys;Draught, at the Chumley�s, NY. A secret little nook that Austinpowers showed me. Black with a good tan/brown head. Lovely dark aniseed aroma with good length. Not dry but equally not creamy, wet or insipid either. I good drop this. In fact on New Years day this was the preferred beer of choice to smooth away the previous pain.
Chumleys Iron Heart Stout;New York, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Chumleys;After drinking a pint of this heavy brew, what felt like iron was my stomach when it came time to actually stand up and search for the door of this cramped, West Village bar-with-no-sign before bars with no signs became trendy in Manhattan. The stout is quite thick and somewhat roasty in a chocolate malt way and you've got to respect Chelsea Brewing, which contract brews all of Chumley's beers, for not skimping on the ingredients with this stout.

Elgoods Double Swan (Bottle);Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elgoods Brewery;Bottle from Beers of Europe. Appearance - golden with a nice fluffy head. Nose - odd base earthy savoury note. Like fish sauce or something. Lemon too. Taste - dried lemon and more savoury food notes. Almost a bit of fertiliser going on too. Palate - close to medium bodied with a tangy texture and a long dry tangy finish. Overall - it�s got a lot of intensity for 4.5% but not sure I like the flavour.

J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Honey Brown;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"For a dark lager, this has some competition, shiner bock, killians and michelob amber boch; not too bad for macro brews. Wainwrights eye is peeken out from between the evil and the eye. 12 oz pop top can. Popped to release a slight sour aroma. Aroma is a little industrialized with metal hints. Pours darker than a pale yellow american beer but I don�t think this really qualifies as dark. Transparent with a couple small stream bubble originations. Now it does have a sweet hint in the smell. Head is alabaster and fades after a few minutes. Taste is not offensive but different in a Pittsburgh kind of way. Gentleman lager personality. This is definitely a good buy in the american lager arena. Price is half that of most other dark american lagers tasted. Finish is tingly on the back of my tongue. No real overwhelming or persistent linger. Not bad. On par with negra modela and lieny�s red."
J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Honey Brown;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;From Can. Poured dark yellow. Little to no head. White, fizzed out pretty quick. Aroma was not stong, but I got some honey and malt. Flavor was the same, with caramel notes in the end. I never saw this before and it wasn�t too bad. Kind of bland. Easy to drink a ton of.
J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Honey Brown;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Some honey and malty odors. Tastes malty, with some hops, honey, and caramel at the end. Seems very alcoholic to me. Not great, but not bad for a BYOB strip joint.
J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Honey Brown;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;[can] Slight hint of honey in the nose. Not much of a flavor for a dark beer. Easy to drink a lot of. The scary thing is that I did not know they still made this stuff.
J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Honey Brown;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;This stuff is pretty bad. Typical cheap beer....harsh, nasty aftertaste, poor aroma, and burns goin down.
J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Honey Brown;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Not bad for what I paid. hints of the honey brown part but not much. Its not much to look at so keep it in the can. Drink this at the end of the night.
J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Honey Brown;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;This beer doesnt even seem like a beer. IT has almost no palate, flavor or aroma thats could be misinterpreted as something close to being a distant relative of a beer. It has no taste if you have had anything else to drink in the past 24 hours it seems, but hell, I give them style points for making so easy to drink without noticing it.
J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Honey Brown;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Not exactly terrible, but not really all that great. It's cheap (I paid $8 for 24 cans), and easy to drink. Kind of like a sweeter version of Sam Adams Light. Kind of

J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Honey Brown;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Really cheap beer which is surprising because it is an american dark. Although it doesnt taste like one its something different for 10$ than an american standard.

There wasn't alot of body here at all plus a bit much in the carbonation. This is only the second mild ale I've had Trafalgar was way better then this. Pretty flavourless beer, not the worst though. I couldn't decern much in the nose just slight malts popping through.

Timmermans Oude Lambiek;Itterbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Unblended Jonge / Oude;Timmermans (John Martin);Found on tap in Trieste of all places, bartender said it had been aged 5 years. Aroma is mellowed out lambic sharp cheese and fresh squeezed lemon juice. Looks clear copper and just tiny surface bubbles, just as a lambic should be. Flavour is notes of vanilla, licorice, oak smoke embedded in a huge acidic lemon body and taking on balsamic vinegar qualities. Palate has a smooth and filling presence, nothing is missed. A very fine lambic indeed.
Lindemans Kriekenlambik;St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Lindemans;Bottle. Smells a bit synthetic, like kids medicine - still its not too bad!

Lindemans Kriekenlambik;St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Lindemans;A very rich and full taste, sour and sweet mixing in together. Sweet overcomes the bitterness, elements of wood and a little bit of carbonation.

Cambridge Benevolence;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Cambridge Brewing Company;On tap at Fortnight Wine Bar in Providence, RI. Black-brown with thick medium-brown fine, head that sticks around. Aroma is soy sauce, chocolate, pumpernickel bread, more dark chocolate, more soy sauce, and some BBQ sauce. Mouthfeel is moderate-coarseness carbonation, medium-light burn, oily, slightly syrupy. Nice. Flavor is chocolate soy sauce with slight tartness and breadiness (maybe a sourdough?). Very good! I normally get soy-sauce from big stouts, but the BDSA is a nice take on it!
Cambridge Benevolence;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Cambridge Brewing Company;Dark brown to black. Red edges. Smells really good.

Dark brown pour with a reddish hue and almost no head. Nose is huge raisin with a hint of lactic tartness. Taste is wonderfully complex with lots of things happening, yet working together so very well. Raisin, oak, tawny port, awesomeness.
Cambridge Benevolence;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Cambridge Brewing Company;Barley heavy aroma with woody-nutty aroma. Deep brown, almost black in color. Very sweet with sour edges and a nutty-woody finish. A bit like a wild barleywine.
Cambridge Benevolence;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Cambridge Brewing Company;Avery Sour Ale Fest. Strongest brew at the whole fest. However no alcohol apparent. Sweet, but not overly sweet. Surprisingly not that full-bodied. The barrel adds some cool character to the brew. Some woodiness and nice tart flavors. One of my favorites of the fest.

Aroma is heavy malt (cookie, caramel, toffee), light hop (herbs, grass), heavy yeast (dough, earth) with notes of cherry, wine, and brown sugar.

Cambridge Benevolence;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Cambridge Brewing Company;On tap at GABF 2009. Another great and really interesting beer from Cambridge. Pours a cloudy dark reddish-amber color with a small off-white head. Aroma is dark fruits, brown sugar, spices, oak, and orange peel. Flavor is sweet malt, spices, cherries, dates, orange, honey, candi sugar, red wine, and a little alcohol. Also a little oaky tartness to it that really adds to the complexity. Palate is medium-full with soft carbonation and very well-hidden ABV. This is a well-done beer overall.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #01 - Oatmeal Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harpoon Brewery;16-Mar-14 (12-oz bottle: Obtained in trade with Eyedrinkale, thanks Mike!) This beer is black in color and capped by half an inch of tan-colored head that settles to a ring and patchy sheet. The nose is mostly roasty malts with a bit of chocolate, oatmeal, black olive, and dark fruit. On the palate, the flavors are roasty and chocolatey, with noticeable oatmeal character, cola, and some coffee, plus a hint of ashtray in the finish. The beer is medium in weight, light-medium in carbonation, and fairly dry in the finish. Overall, this is a fine oatmeal stout that's cellared particularly well for a 5% ABV beer.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #01 - Oatmeal Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harpoon Brewery;Very light pale, beige head. Minor lacing on the glass. Mahogany in color, although the faintest of light will come through. Smell-Burnt coffee aromas. (I wasn�t going to write this, but I also detect some soy sauce/salty smells. This didn�t appear at all in the tasting.) Thinner mouthfeel than expected, but very flavorful. Unlike many other Oatmeal Stouts, this one has a definitive hop presense. Still, the major flavor component is burnt malts. No noticable chewiness. Nice balance on the carbonation. The taste profile is the best part of this beer. I don�t find this to be particularly spectacular or unusual. I find the higher hop content interesting and wish that it had more body, then I believe it would be a truly superior beer.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #01 - Oatmeal Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harpoon Brewery;Bottle. Pours deep brown with a beige head. Lightly roasted malts, oxidation, light sweetness, and light toast. The oxidation isn�t overpowering. Really not that bad, especially for a 10 year old beer that has no business being aged for even half that long.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #01 - Oatmeal Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harpoon Brewery;Bottle. Dark dark brown with a minimal head. Aroma is slight chocolate/coffee with a strange chemical smell. Taste is faint oats and coffee. This beer tastes old.

Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #01 - Oatmeal Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harpoon Brewery;Black pour in glass. Pleasant aroma of Quaker Oats, chocolates, breads and dough. Taste is smooth, albeit average for the genre. Rated 10/6/03
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #01 - Oatmeal Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harpoon Brewery;A perfectly middle-of-the-road sweet stout. It might be a good session beer. Otherwise it had no real stand-out characteristics.

Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #01 - Oatmeal Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Harpoon Brewery;Sampled with stegosaurus on our second Boston tour. I forget the place we had it at but I am sure he will remember.Dark pour with off white head. Roast aroma and in taste as well. Mouth feel was a little thin and it could have been balanced better. Not a bad brew but I was dissapointed a little.

Terminal Gravity Bar X Stout;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Stout;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;On tap at Tap That Growlers in La Grande Oregon. Pours a satisfying rich thick black brew with a nice fulsome tannish head that slowly dissipates. The aroma is big on dark chocolate, some coffee notes, and a bit of burnt sugar.

The color is a hazy dark brown and it has a fine but collapsing light brown head.

Bitter but short finish. No aftertaste. Light-bodied, watery palate. The name of this beer is ""The hunt"", and there's a picture of a moose in the label. Maybe I'm blind, but I just can't see the connection between those two. I cannot imagine a moose hunter drinking this stuff (pocket-warm) in the woods, either."

Abbeydale Best Bitter;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Abbeydale Brewery;Bright bottled from London Drinker festival. 36 hours ago. Clear amber session bitter. Beautiful aroma - warm and malty with suggestions of chocolate yet alive with citric notes from oranges. Neutral palate with medium to thin body. The hops make a big impact, though they are a bit blurred and on the whole are more bittering than fragrant. The chocolate notes are repeated in the flavour. This is a very tasty bitter which has stood up very well to being kept off the yeast for so long. Some of the freshness has gone, and the hops are not as precise, but the aroma is certainly more evident, and the malt quality better defined.
Abbeydale Best Bitter;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Abbeydale Brewery;Mid amber colour. Clammy hop and stinky malt in the aroma.

Clear and bright pale gold with a decent mottled off-white head. Smells like a floral slightly chalky golden ale - taste follows; simple, well-made dry and floral golden, not earthshaking but pleasant to drink. Average body, mild carbonation, medium-quick grassy/floral finish. Went down a perfect treat with my Doom Bar ale pie - extra point!"
Nottingham Extra Pale Ale;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nottingham Brewery;Nov 2018 - Cask handpull at the William Morris Hammersmith as Nottingham Extra Pale Ale. I do love the old school pump clip, but from there it's downhill. Pale yellow, clear and still with a foamy beige head that endures. Aroma is bready, some grains, club in Neath, cheap grain whisky (watered down), little buttery. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is thin and papery, cardboard and dust, powdered stones and sawdust in water. Hmm, I like cask beer more than most but this tastes pretty much like drinking your gran's carpet. (4-4-4-4-11=2.7)

Good lacing up the side of the glass. Aroma of lemon peel, caramel, biscuity malts, fresh cereal, and soap. Fairly bland and a little watery.

Oldershaw Isaac's Gold;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oldershaw Brewery;Cask at �Spoons, Milton Keynes. Gold with a white head. Some citric hop in the aroma, but �Spoons beer-chilling policy didn�t help close investigation. Some fruitiness and grain in the taste, and a mid bitter finish. Despite all that there is an overwhelming watery quality about this beer that renders it pretty ordinary.

Oldershaw Isaac's Gold;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oldershaw Brewery;Again brought upto the North West travelled 150 miles very well. I�ll take previous comments of citrus and narrow that down to a soft hint of grapefruit, light in the aroma but heavier in the taste. Nice dry taste with a little kick an unusual pleasant balance. On the finish of a pint i could say the thought would be in your head i hope theres more. Rep from S&N in this afternoon enjoyed both the Old Boy but was overwhelmed with this cask and really enjoyed it.
Oldershaw Isaac's Gold;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oldershaw Brewery;As expected, it�s deep gold in colour, with a distinct tangy hop aroma, which carries through very strongly on the palate. However, I also detected a little dry malt and spicy undertones to provide some balance and a little more complexity than the norm. Dry, crisp finish. A good example of the style. Cask (handpump), also at the Victoria, Lincoln (not at the same time as imdownthepub)

Aroma of burnt toast or dark roasted coffee with just a hint of hops. Taste at tip of tongue of slightly sweetened coffee, almost drying, then maltiness and fading finish. The mid tongue flavors of nutty coffee are the highlight. Wish there was a bit longer finish or heavier mouthfeel. Not bad, but I wouldn't think it ""award winning""."

R & B Hoppelganger IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Interesting IPA, not to hoppy. Taste earthy and woody. Purchased a bottle, pours dark black with a med. head.
R & B Hoppelganger IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);"Bomber bottle. Pours a hazy amber with a frothy white head. Very mild aroma of hops, like pine. Taste is mildly bitter, some pine, citrus notes, over a mild malt base. Finish is a bit bitter, a little pine. Would make a fine ""pale ale"" but not really hoppy enough to be called an IPA."
R & B Hoppelganger IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Aroma of malts and hops. A decent IPA but not great. The hops got lost somewhere. Get something else.
R & B Hoppelganger IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Poured a clouded copper-orange with a big white head. Nose of bitter hops and weak malts. Overall, the beer is unspectacular, especially compared to its label and name.
R & B Hoppelganger IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Rating #939 - Jan 25th, 2014 - Bottle from Coop. Love hop puns so naturally this caught my eye. Clear golden amber pour with a weak, white head that bubbles away to a ring. Aroma is strong with hoppy overtones, pine, resin, lemon. Taste is more of the same, dry hops and cakey malts dominating the flavour, with a dose of citrus zest and piney sweet notes. Nice.
R & B Hoppelganger IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Tap@Gotham Vancouver. One finger foam. Slight hazy. Golden. Fine herbal to fruity notes. Not a very intense bitterness. Guess a lot of like this hoppy but easy drinkable steak brew. Fine for me too.

Aroma is mild citrus and flowers with mild toasty malts. Taste is moderate hop bitterness with a light malt sweetness underneath. Medium body with some decent carbonation. Overall, an average IPA that is fairly easy to drink and a good place for those interested in this style to start with.
R & B Hoppelganger IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Unclear amber orange, big creamy off white head lasts. Mild hoppy aroma. Medium bitter hop taste dominates, soft malt background. Light to medium body, lively carbonation. Light bitter citrus finish. Basic. LBW (Lagerboys Be Wary)
R & B Hoppelganger IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);crisp hops, and Great colour. Aroma is a bit thin for an ipa. As it warms the malts come on more and it is less initial hoppyness, there is always a pleasant hop on the back end, but it may be a bit too much for some. Not a bad go-to thirst quencher, if can get it at the beer store.
New Glarus Unplugged Triple;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;New Glarus Brewing Company;Hurt by age. Very flat. 2004 Bottle. Oxidized and some malt, apples. It was likely much better in the past.
New Glarus Unplugged Triple;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;New Glarus Brewing Company;Shared generously by daknole. Bottle pours deep amber/brown with an off-white head. Aroma shows tawny like oxidation with notes of burnt brown sugar, graham cracker, apple cobbler, and some overripe fruit. Flavor shows dates, caramel, and light hazelnut. Overall body is moderate to full, somewhat flat, and finishes with boozy warmth. The age seems to have given some extra depth, but it could definately stand to have a little more carb to break up the body a bit.
New Glarus Unplugged Triple;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;New Glarus Brewing Company;Clear light brown pour. Carbonation is gone. Sweet malty aroma, some oxidized notes. Flavor of apple, caramel, oxidized notes. 2004 bottle!

Held up pretty well. (2093)
New Glarus Unplugged Triple;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle @ home, courtesy of Ughsmash. Huge thanks! Caramel-amber appearance with no head and little carbonation. Dusty, Belgian yeasty, dark fruity, dull caramel aroma. Caramel, fig, brown sugar, Belgian yeasty, caramel malty, slightly spicy, somewhat boozy flavor with a warming finish. Some oxidation. The beer�s settled out to something like a thin barley wine after all these years- way past its prime but fun to try anyhow.
New Glarus Unplugged Triple;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;New Glarus Brewing Company;Generous thanks to BenC for sharing...thanks Ben! - Pours rosy amber with no head to speak of. Toffee and butterscotch on the nose, with some sharp alcohol. Faint spicing. Not much here at all. The taste...whoa. Waay off. More butterscotch, toffee, and all sorts of candy sweetness. Cloying and sticky, with a weird sweet malt aftertaste and a bit of booze. Watery and a bit thin, but still slick. Waaay past it�s prime, but really happy to have tried this.
New Glarus Unplugged Triple;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;New Glarus Brewing Company;"2003(?) Vintage 3/03/2010: New Glarus Unplugged Triple... Aroma: Malty and boozy; faint fruits and plenty of complex sugars; Appearance: Dull copper; mostly clear; pretty much still/no carbonation. Flavor: Slightly oxidized, but an interesting flavor combinations of toffee, caramel, plump and fuzzy fruits, mequite honey; slightly oxidized; plenty of alcohol, but not burning; adequately sweet and malty (the nuances of the original flavors have most likely collapsed over time). Palate: Medium to medium-full, slightly syrupy; flat. Overall: Unique flavor and aroma; that I am not able to put the descriptions into words at all since its characteristics are unlike anything I have had before; seems more like a thinned out, well-aged barleywine rather than a Triple; a bit of carbonation would probably bring this beer back to life; not too bad at all if it pushing 7 years old! 12 fl. oz. bottle (twist-off cap) from awaller05 via trade. Thanks Andy! Rating #127 for this beer."
New Glarus Unplugged Triple;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;New Glarus Brewing Company;"12 oz. bottle shared by shigadeyo. Thanks Craig! Pours a hazy brownish amber color with zero head. The aroma had big ripe fruitiness with sweet malts and a little boozy; much more like an English barleywine now. The flavor was also more like an English barleywine with a sweet caramel maltiness and ripe fruits. Dry at the finish with a hint of the spices it probably had fresh. The alcohol was not present in the flavor, but was warming and I would say bigger than 10% now. Medium bodied; this has held up pretty well to be 7 years old."
New Glarus Unplugged Triple;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle shared by shigadeyo. Poured hazy dark amber pour with a minimal frothy white head that mostly diminished and has little lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted malt and grapefruit hop aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy prune sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate duration. Good complex brew and maybe a little old.

Flickr &#40http://www.flickr.com/photos/26049401@N08/3849794613/&#41 A very moist, vinous wet apple cider presents in the nose. Aged, but smooth. A nip of pale caramel and a long glissando of ice cider. With a surprising snap from a twist-off, the beer pours a thinly hazed, but mostly clear, bronzed-golden, tanned, but bright. Little head, but a sparkle of carbonation. Graham cracker smacks first, then a sharp acidic tang of fruit cake, calvados, and gooseberries. Warm and lightly oxidized, but not obliterated by time. Not dusty, nor tasting of wet-cardboard. Instead, a very well melded spice, pale fruit, and cookie dough flavor. Palate is yielding, with a nice balance of alcohol, crisp sugars, and yeast flavors. The mature fruit flavors that ink at aged liqueurs and dried figs is probably the best aspect of this beer�s age. Surprisingly, and pleasantly, enjoyable. Thanks Jason, so much, for this special opportunity to reach into the back-catalog of New Glarus and give this a try before it completely fades into the fog of time.

This is one of their better beers and totally unique, making it worthy of trying...The loook is fine, nice and clear but not a piss water gold...What stands out about this beer is the aroma. At first I thought I was nuts but since this was the first beer of the night I went with instinct and my beer buddy finally agreed. It smells like marijunia, throughout. I kept looking around to see if someone was smoking outside, and they weren�t. The taste is ok, not as great as the aroma, not pot taste just a light non skunky pilsner. If you like the smell of weed give this is a shot.

Blackstone Maibock;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blackstone Brewing Company;Clear dark gold with a pinkish hue.

Blackstone Maibock;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blackstone Brewing Company;Pours a clear golden-orange body with a lacing off-white to beige head.

Blackstone Maibock;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blackstone Brewing Company;Noogfest High 5. Sample from a growler thanks to Butters. Golden orange, white head. Aroma is malty, caramel, fruits, toffee. Taste is the same, sweet fruits and toffee.
Blackstone Maibock;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blackstone Brewing Company;On draft at Woody�s Smokes and Brews. Pours a very clear dark gold with fair near white head. Very faint banana notes and honey. Flavors of sweet vanilla, corn, DMS, and some alcohol heat in the nose and tail. Very slight grassy hop bitterness in the finish. Pretty much spot on for BJCP heller bock style. But I didn�t personally care for it all that much.
Blackstone Maibock;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blackstone Brewing Company;Growler from Blackstone. I poured this beer, walked away for 10 minutes and came back to a glass with an amazing spider-web design left by the head. The aroma is honey, wheat, apricot, cherry, and I could tell there would be roast in the taste. Strong flavor of roast caramel and some citrus. Pretty good overall, not a good session beer though.
Blackstone Maibock;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blackstone Brewing Company;"5 hour hold growler brought back by my buddy Erik. Pours a dark gold with a decent white head. The nose is pretty sugary with some corn, crisp hops, and pears. This is a very sweet lager up front and in the sticky finish. There are slightly rosy notes along with wood, corn husks, and paper. I�m not a huge ""light-colored lager"" fan in the first place and I found this one to be a bit heavy on the sucrose flavor."
Blackstone Maibock;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blackstone Brewing Company;Tap. O.k., skip visuals for a minute, this smells like my mom. Seriously. The heavy perfume she would wear when I was a kid, the smell of Winston�s smoked throughout the day, the smell of sweat and defiance she had getting back from a shift at whatever crap job she worked to support 4 of us, all that was brought to mind. This has that perfumy indignant thing working. Orange peel and light cherry cough drop flavor. This has a slight amber edge to the pour. There is more than a little cherry here. A bit sticky, maybe the best maibock I�ve had, I�d have to check on that. The thickness makes it hard to discern, but damn, this has a nice finish like sugar daddy with warm pretzel, and a warm muffin note too. Ap-4 ar-10 tas-7 pal-3 ov-17
Blackstone Maibock;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blackstone Brewing Company;Daft at Restaurant. Pale color in the glass with a white head that left great lacing.

Blackstone Maibock;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Blackstone Brewing Company;"On tap into a 10 oz. ale glass. Lemon zest and yeast in the nose with some light bread. Clear gold yellow in the glass with a mostly diminishing medium sized white head; oily and spotty lacing. Smooth, medium to full bodied. Tastes of rye bread, honey sweetness, and pistachio strong in the finish. Spicy and noble hops; a bit mealy with a bit of DME on the finish too. Late astringency mars the mouthfeel. I found this beer to be bland and weak in the flavor for the amount of body this has. It ended up syrupy in texture; I�ve had thicker beers that felt lighter because they balanced their feel with their flavor and ingredient palate. On reflection, I should have known how this beer would play in my mouth watching the slow carbonation struggle up through the middle of the glass in a clear beer that was lighter in color than I expected. A disappointment overall."

Jerome Diablo;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cerveceria Jerome;"30-Mar-14 (660-ml bottle) If ""Diablo"" is yet another attempt at a Duvel knock-off (like seemingly all these ""Devil"" beers are), then this is probably the worst I�ve tasted. It�s bready and yeasty with some light, grassy and fruity overtones, some coconut, a light grassiness. Aromas are bready and doughy, some tropical fruits, but not much going on here. The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and smooth on the palate. Hazy, golden in color, and capped by half an inch of white head that settles to a ring. Overall, pretty boring and not worth drinking any more than necessary to finish writing my review."
Jerome Diablo;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cerveceria Jerome;Bottle from perfect pour. Pours golden with very little head. A bit fruity on the tongue. tastes metallic and funky and not in a good way. Finish lingers a bit. Nasty stuff!
Jerome Diablo;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cerveceria Jerome;Old paper review from summer 2009. Decent light gold, a little icky with the moldy looking floaties, small white cap with good retention and ropy, slippery lacing. Thick fruity aroma, guava, mild spiced yeast - appealing but the fruitiness misses. Fresh dark tropical fruit taste with a touch of citrus, mild yeast, slight well placed bitterness, too warm = too sweet. Not bad, not all that far off from some US versions. (**update- I doubt that last statement!)
Jerome Diablo;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cerveceria Jerome;poured copper color into glass with offwhite head. there was a very light lacing on side of glass. very little hop odour to this one was a little malty (sweet). although there was some alcohol as well. if more hops would have been much better beer.
Jerome Diablo;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cerveceria Jerome;Picked this up at Corti Bros. in Sacramento, one of the better selections in the area. Pours a deep amber, not much head. Smell and taste are very sweet, bitter citrus, and sadly that carries onto the taste and mouthfeel. An almost metalic taste, but not off-puting, just bitter sweet battery, is that bad?? Good beer, not great, maybe it�s a code date issue.
Jerome Diablo;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cerveceria Jerome;Beautiful golden pour covered by a gentle white slice. Softly estery (green, unripe banana), vegetal and gently malty, bready, almost cakey maltiness. It starts off very sweet on the tongue and the fact that hops are almost absent does not help to redeem that. The light mineral aspects growing towards the finish feel slightly metallic. Pretty simplistic, linear palate in which a growing amount of alcohol is felt with each sip.I did not notice any major flaws compared to other raters, but the general dullness, heat and sloppy crackery malts are not great qualities either.
Jerome Diablo;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cerveceria Jerome;Sample at Julio�s Spring Beer Fest (disclaimer - memory somewhat blurred after perhaps a few too many samples) Not impressed
Jerome Diablo;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cerveceria Jerome;Pours a medium golden yellowish color. Aromas of fruit, yeast and some pepper. Flavors are sour, yeasty, and a touch of sweetness at the finish.
Jerome Diablo;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cerveceria Jerome;My bottle, labelled in english, states that this is a Belgian style ale. It pours a slightly hazy deep golden with a frothy white head. Aroma is sweet grains and hard-rock candy. The palate is sweet and slightly sticky, grainy with hints of banana. No spice, no yeast, nearly no bitterness. It is more like a euro strong lager to me than anything. In keeping with the label, the appearance and profile of this beer are more in keeping with a Belgian blonde (albeit a rather poor one) than an English ale.
Jerome Diablo;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cerveceria Jerome;"Bottle. Pours a clear golden color with a small white head. Nose is lightly spicey with a sticky sugary note. Palate is medium and tingly with a nice finish. Flavors of light spiciness, coriander maybe, with a light toasted malt note and some sticky honey and caramel notes. The description listed here is wrong, this is what my bottle says "" This is an Andean Strong ale with a creamy head, a smooth beginning, a fruity light profile and an explosive finish! Aged 3 months prior to bottling"""
Jerome Rubia;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveceria Jerome;Rated on 10-09-2009 (Bottle) This beer pours a small fizzy white head with a short retention, mostly transparent/slightly hazy pale yellow body, fizzy, lively, fast rising carbonation, floaties, and one ring of lacing. The Aroma is malty, vanilla and hops. The Taste mimics the Aroma and this beer has a dry finish. The Palate is tingly and this beer is medium bodied. Overall, this beer has a lot of sediment in the bottom of the bottle and the flavor of this beer just did not leave me wanting it again. The taste seems disjointed and all over the place. This is a beer I do not recommend.
Jerome Rubia;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveceria Jerome;A little bit of hay, a little bit of honey, a little bit of butter. Not particularly impressive in any capacity.
Jerome Rubia;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveceria Jerome;22 oz. bottle, $5 at HyVee in Iowa July 2010, kept in the fridge since then. First, I want to respect this for being, as the label says, totally sourced from Argentine-grown ingredients. And for being brewed, if you�ll Google Map the location, in a village so far up in the Andes that anyone stepping out back for a smoke is in Chile. That said: Pours a golden color with amber highlights, some particles floating around. Sudsy head. Smell is malty and beery, a touch of fruit ester. There may also be a note of bacterial contamination, but I can�t say for sure. Taste seems pretty square within the Blond Ale style. They�re calling it an Argentine White Ale, but I only get barley malt here. Slight note of wood smoke. Just slightly tart. A bit of dead yeast way in the background. Frankly, I kind of like it. Maybe it�s the luck of a well-sealed bottle kept on a shelf without too much light. Ah, but trying to pour the rest of the beer into the glass brings up a big chunk of sediment.
Jerome Rubia;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveceria Jerome;Bottle: &nbsp Straw in color, large rocky white head, spotty lacing, mild carbonation. &nbsp Looks okay at least. &nbsp Soft grassiness and floral notes on the nose. &nbsp Little bit of DMS/Band Aid on first sip. &nbsp Otherwise a bit mealy. &nbsp Not as bad as other seem to be rating it, but certainly not great. &nbsp Loads of straw or grasiness on the tongue, especially on the finish. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate. &nbsp Some fruit skin on the finish. &nbsp A little bit of a metallic twang emerges after the finish. &nbsp Honestly, not as bad as everyone says it is, but certainly not great.
Jerome Rubia;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveceria Jerome;Appearance: clear golden. Aroma: light vanilla, lemongrass. Taste: bitter, light citrus/lemon. Finish: medium, bitter, mineral notes. Notes: Boring, not very good.
Jerome Rubia;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveceria Jerome;bottle from the distro 6/4/10. darker pour than expected and slightly hazy. oddly medicinal aroma... bitter dried herbs, spicy hops, dust and old stale grain. the flavor is medicinal as well... terribly bitter and dirty. crisp sharp texture is irritating and drives the awful flavor further into my tongue. this may be the first beer i have truly spit out... curiosity won�t even let me swallow this crap. yucky... 3/4/1/1/3/1.2
Jerome Rubia;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveceria Jerome;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a large sized head of yellow brown colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a semi-hazy with floating particulate yellow white colored body. The mild aroma was floral and malty. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of floral coriander hops and malt. An OK brew just nothing special.
Jerome Rubia;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveceria Jerome;This beer is very different. It smells salty and tastes salty with some underlying fruit characteristics. Good carbonation and froth but lackluster. Probably a good food beer but not with pizza or wings.

Jerome Rubia;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cerveceria Jerome;Pours a golden yellow. Aromas of pale malt, some hops, some citrus. Flavor of light malts, citrus and some hop bite.
Jerome Negra;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Stout;Cerveceria Jerome;30-Mar-14 (660-ml bottle) I guess as these Jerome beers go, this is one of the better ones, but this still isn�t that great. It pours a black body with almost no head. The nose is lightly roasty, but also has a prominent black olive component, some soy sauce, and light blackberry tartness. On the palate, it�s not so much roasty, but shows black olives, coffee, dark chocolate, some tobacco, dark berries, and earth. There�s some tartness here, and not just a hint, and this is a bit off-putting. The beer is light-medium bodied and seems quite thin for a stout. Carbonation is light as well, and the finish is reasonably dry. Overall, this is below average stout. It�s thin, tastes like black olives, and has an odd tartness.
Jerome Negra;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Stout;Cerveceria Jerome;"Rated on 10-06-2009. This bottled beer pours a medium sized tan fizzy head with a short retention, opaque black body, very little carbonation, and spotty amounts of lacing. The Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and dried fruits. The Taste mimics the Aroma. The Palate is tingly and thin. This beer is light-medium bodied. Overall, the Aroma is better than the flavor. The texture is too thin for this beer�s style and does not come across as a true Stout. This is a beer that is not on my ""want to drink again sometime"" list."
Jerome Negra;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Stout;Cerveceria Jerome;31st July 2009 Oapque black beer. Light crisp palate. Smooth malt, sourish like a good porter. Very light smoke, barely there. Mild sour fruit. Smooth, almost creamy, dark malt and a nice minerally finish. Finally a decent Argentinian beer!
Jerome Negra;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Stout;Cerveceria Jerome;22 ounce bottle (labeled Andean Stout). Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch tan head that stayed around for a while. There�s also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and sweet, the brew smells like dark fruit (raisins, prunes), molasses, chocolate, coffee and some charred/burnt malt. The flavors are the same as the aroma, but not quite as strong. I do like the taste, but it does seem a little weak in comparison to the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it�s a little bit coating with moderate carbonation. Overall it�s a decent enough brew, I�d buy it again in the future. It�s certainly worth trying for just $3.99 a bottle!
Jerome Negra;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Stout;Cerveceria Jerome;This is a good smooth dark Irish style ale. Smooth molasis malts with a a soy sauce aroma
Jerome Negra;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Stout;Cerveceria Jerome;Bottle: &nbsp Black, large light brown head, nice lacing. &nbsp Nice roasted malt nose, some lactose like sweetness. &nbsp Fairly roasty on the tongue, start to finish. &nbsp Not a big malt base, very little hop which is welcomed. &nbsp Slight ash on the backside. &nbsp Moderate to thin body and mouthfeel. &nbsp More astray on the finish. &nbsp Simple, but straight forward and respectable.
Jerome Negra;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Stout;Cerveceria Jerome;660mL bomber thing from Cleveland Park Liquors. The pour is a deep brown with no head formation. Scant, weak, large bubbles form and subside. Nose is salty black olives. Taste is olive juice, astringent bitterness, salt, chlorine, pool cleaner. Non existent palate. Drainpour. Needs a new brewer probably.
Jerome Negra;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Stout;Cerveceria Jerome;poured dark and dirty into glass, light brown head with little lacing left behind, a malty sweeter stout than I am used to, a medium body and carbonation, takes a bit of getting used to.
Jerome Negra;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Stout;Cerveceria Jerome;Bottle from World Market. Opaque black-brown pour with a brown head leaving sparse lace. Chocolate, licorice, coffee, cherries and dates flesh out the aromas from this surprisingly light-medium bodied stout. There is a tartness early and in the finish and then a metallic aftertaste as if I bit my lip. With the medium carbonation and relatively light body, the mouth feel is lacking. Interestingly, this stout is sweet and sour early, transitioning to umami and sour at the finish, with minimal bitterness throughout. I thought this could be a nice sessionable sweet stout, but the metallic aftertaste ruins that idea. I�d try it again, but would like to have it closer to the source.
Jerome Negra;Mendoza / Potrerillos, Argentina;Stout;Cerveceria Jerome;Older bottle never opened from Thomas. Pours thin. Slight cola and chocolate flavor. Carbonation fades. Not too impressive.
Boscos London Porter;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);Clear black hue with a thin and sticky light beige head. The nose has some earthy caramel and some biscuity chocolate. The flavor is much the same, soft and medium bodied. Light caramel and light biscuity tones with a very light and semi-dry chocolaty tones. Meh.
Boscos London Porter;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);On tap as part of sampler. Dark amber color with minimal head. Lightly chocolaty and lightly bitter. This whole beer strikes me as a little thin and watery from appearance to finish. Perhaps they were trying to be truer to style, but I prefer the Americanized version of this beer.
Boscos London Porter;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);Pours dark molasses brown. Moderate head moderate lacing. Prominent dark chocolate and espresso combination that is a great balance of sweet and bitter. Mild carbonation and medium body. Long finish of mild bitter hops and roasted malt. This is one of their best beers.
Boscos London Porter;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);Tasted on tap at Nashville brewpub in standard pint glass. Opaque dark brown color with creamy beige head. Some retention and lace. Bready, nutty, hints of dark coffee and chocolate. Conservative hops bitterness, very little in aroma. Fruity ale yeast esters. Medium carbonation, crisp dry finish. Satisfying, true-to-style porter, but otherwise unmemorable.

Boscos London Porter;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Porter;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);Sampled at Bosco�s Squared in Memphis. Dark brown with a bit of red. Big roasted notes and a well hopped porter. This brewery seems to like well hopped beers. Decent chocolate and coffee. Those hops make this a different take on a classic style. Nice.

Boscos Charlie Brown;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Brown Ale;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);"This is the first beer that I've had that was brewed from a recipe in Charlie Papazians' book that I didn't brew myself. I couldn't have brewed it any better. No homebrew taste at all ;.) A good brown ale. Had it cask conditioned, but Charlie autographed a bottle personally to take home!"

Boscos Charlie Brown;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Brown Ale;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);Had on tap in Nashville and it was cask-conditioned. Dark brown with tan creamy head, some lacing , medium-bodied. Aroma was what I expected, nutty and sweet with a hint of fruit. The taste was a little less nutty and a little more sweet. Balance was okay, a little more dry hop characteristics would have made this a top-notch brew. Still, it worked great with the steak I had for dinner.
Boscos Charlie Brown;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Brown Ale;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);From a sampler: Pours a brownish-amber color with a thin off-white head and thin lacing. Light malt and honey aroma. Medium- to light-bodied with both sweet malt and tart hops flavors. It also has a long and lightly bitter finish. A decent Brown Ale.

Nose of faint malt, subtle hop. The flavor is toasty, balanced and grassy. Finishes clean, still obviously thin and made with pale malt.
Manhattan Beach Blonde;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Manhattan Beach Brewing;Pretty standard beer, kinda tasted like a bud light. Nothing really special about it. It had a really light aroma, and dry finish.
Manhattan Beach Bohemian Pilsner;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Manhattan Beach Brewing;Draught. Pours clear pale yellow with a fizzy, white head, mostly lasting with excellent lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (grain, meal, cereal), light hops (grass), heavy yeast (sweat, dough) with notes of corn. Light bodied, dry texture, soft carbonation, and a chalky finish. Average duration, light sweetness, acidity, and bitterness. Closer to pale lager or malt liquor than a Bohemian Pilsener.
Manhattan Beach Bohemian Pilsner;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Manhattan Beach Brewing;Tap at MBBC. Pours a clear golden color with a nice white head. Aroma of malt bread spicy hops. Taste is crisp malty spicy hops. I remeber it was great with the Thai chicken pizza sitting in one of the front windows open on a warm summer afternoon. Great session beer.
Manhattan Beach Bohemian Pilsner;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Manhattan Beach Brewing;This is ok, but does not taste nearly as good as it looks or smells. It is dark gold with a medium, creamy head, slightly off-white, that slowly shrinks and leaves nice lace in even rings. The smell is mostly bready with some honey, citrus and flowers. It�s quite malty and very nice. The taste, though, is mostly just crackers with some white bread, with cracker aftertaste and a dominant, rather bland bitterness of grass and lemon pulp. The flavour is weak and not ciomplex but it holds up well to food.
Manhattan Beach Bohemian Pilsner;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Manhattan Beach Brewing;Tap @ brewpub: Yellow gold with ring head. Grainy aroma as you would expect. The flavor is crisp with typical grain hairspray flavor with a sweet aftertaste. It�s actually not bad for a Pils.

This beer is a clear golden color with a medium and fluffy white head that burns off slowly. Thin rings of lace on the glass. Aroma of Saaz hops and sweet malt, along with sweet spices. Light, effervescent body with a tart hops and spice flavor backed up by woody malt. The finish is fairly hoppy and bitter and leaves a spiced aftertaste. I believe the bartender told me the brewer was from the Czech Republic, so maybe that is why I enjoyed this beer the most out of the ones I tried.
Manhattan Beach Bohemian Pilsner;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Manhattan Beach Brewing;Assistant Brewery Jake and Brewer Karol gave me some of the Pils direct from the tank, unfiltered. No off flavors, tasty, fairly rich with nice, lightly hoppy finish.
Manhattan Beach Bohemian Pilsner;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Manhattan Beach Brewing;Not sure if it's intentional but this has something of an oaky flavor. Sweet with a dry hoppy finish.

Manhattan Beach Dominator Hefeweizen;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Manhattan Beach Brewing;Sample at the brewpub. Not sure why a perfectly good Doppelbock name was wasted on this beer, but whatever. Served with a lemon. Pours a hazy yellow color with a medium thin ivory white head that diminishes slowly.

Drinking it right now at the brewery!
Manhattan Beach Dominator Hefeweizen;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Manhattan Beach Brewing;Tap @ Brewpub: Dominator Hefeweizen: Super cloudy orange, light head and lacing.

Manhattan Beach Dominator Hefeweizen;Manhattan Beach, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Manhattan Beach Brewing;Cidery, appley oakiness are all something of a surprise and whether intentional or not allow a little interest. No traditional clove or banana flavors.

Hair of the Frog Railway Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Hair of the Frog;Very flat. Mono-dimensional, with only roasted barley notes present. Boy, this really needs carbonation!
Hair of the Frog Railway Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Hair of the Frog;No strong aroma present even as the brew warms. There are some hoppy hints in the flavor, but no malts, chocolates, or coffee. It needed more character and depth to be a good porter in my book.
Hoffmans;Waterford City, County Waterford, Ireland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterford (Diageo);Normal cheap crap. Has some more taste than the very worst beers of our world, but not enough to warrant drinking it. Descriptions are futile. Basically this is an Irish beer, given a German/Dutch name to compete with the crappy lagers that those two countries import to Ireland. Seeing as this has only three ratings, it is not competing well.
Hoffmans;Waterford City, County Waterford, Ireland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterford (Diageo);18/05/06 Ireland. Good golden body with average white head. Nothing really stands out too much so it was fairly easy to drink, some grassy bitterness and a hint of corn.
Hoffmans;Waterford City, County Waterford, Ireland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterford (Diageo);Standard lager color, medium sized vanishing white head. Corny and sweet, boring aroma. Thin bodied. Very dull flavor: slight corn and sweetness, aftertaste is slightly hopped and dry. Medium carbonation.
Hoffmans;Waterford City, County Waterford, Ireland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterford (Diageo);Brewed by Guinness and once upon a time available throughout Ireland this beer is now only available in Waterford City, Ireland and the surrounding hinterland. Canned Hoffmans can ocassionally be found in other parts of Munster. Hoffmans is a refreshing alternative to Guinness' Harp Lager, but after the acquisition of Cheerys Brewery by Guinness production was quickly curtailed to ensure Harp remained the dominant Irish lager. Hoffmans has a very light complexion, is a very smooth beer to drink with little after taste. Very refreshing and a good choice for someone not in the mood to drink traditional Irish Ales or Stouts.
Gotlands Wisby Red Ale;Visby, Sweden;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gotlands Bryggeri (Spendrups);Sampled draught at Svensk Fat�lsfestival, Nyn�shamn Ruby/red in colour. Grapefruit cascade hop aroma. Sweet, clean and very soapy. with bitter orangey finsih. Strikingly similar to what an average American brewpub chain offer as a regular beer, but over here it's a rare thing...
Bredaryds Guld�l;Bredaryd, Sweden;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bredaryds W�rdshus;"Sampled draught at Svensk Fat�lsfestival, Nyn�shamn Reddish amber, despite the fact the name means ""golden beer"". Aroma of malt and almond. Medium dry and malty with pleasant toffee flavour. The grassy, orangey bitterness sets in early. Besides a relativley strong almond flavour it is rather discrete, and really complex."
Courage Dark Mild;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Mild Ale;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Keg at the Chiswick Memorial Club. Pours a deep chestnut with a lasting tight foam. Roasty malt and an unappealing winey sourness - either they don't sell much or it's the first of the day.
Courage Dark Mild;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Mild Ale;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);"Keg at the Bugle, Reading. Pitch black with a thin ring of cream head, tawny brown when held to the light; dusty malt aroma; watery texture with chocolate malt flavours and a milky coffee finish. An OK keg mild, but not a patch on the modern cask alternatives."
Courage Dark Mild;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Mild Ale;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);[Keg at The Bugle, Reading] Astonishingly, in all the time I�ve worked in Reading amongst its many Courage pubs, I�ve never come across this beer before, and as a lover of milds I was quick to try it. It pours deep brown, almost black, with a moderate but lasting creamy head. There�s very little smell, which makes your first taste more of a surprise. This is dominated by beautiful deep, roasted malts, with a hint of coffee in the background. Unfortunately, once you�ve enjoyed the first hit of flavour you realise that it is a little weak and watery, and feel that it could have been much improved by being cask conditioned rather than merely kegged. That said, it still has a few surprises up its sleeve. There is an unusual twist of lemon in the finish, and a growing gentle smokiness in the aftertaste. It leaves an odd mixture of dryness and syrup on the inside of your mouth. There are certainly many better milds out there than this, but considering this is a relatively low ABV kegged effort invented by a brewer whose other beers weren�t that much cop, this is actually a pretty decent effort. I wonder if, now that Wells & Youngs have taking it over, they might produce a cask version�? We can but hope�
Courage Dark Mild;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Mild Ale;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Searles, Hunstanton. Very milky coffee dusted with chocolate. Puff of smoke. Earthy, slightly burnt aroma. Pitch body draped with beige. BOTESF? Oh dear.
Courage Dark Mild;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Mild Ale;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Keg at The Plough, Little Bourton, Oxon. Very dark brown with beige head. Thin, almost flavourless mild, although there is a touch of heavy roasted malt. Quick and carbonated on the finish. Not great.
Courage Dark Mild;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Mild Ale;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Draught at Mariners Arms, Braunton, North Devon. It pours a very dark beer with a nice creamy head. Initial flavours of olive oil. Watery. A rather weak finish follows. Decent, nothing more.
Courage Dark Mild;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Mild Ale;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Draught. A black mild with a whitish short-lived head. The aroma is dry and a bit thin. The taste is decent: roasted malts are very prevalent. Mild tasting like it should be, with a short finish. Does the trick and better than expected.
Courage Dark Mild;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Mild Ale;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Smooth and rich. Silky and creamy texture but lacking flavor. Dark brown color with red and burgundy wood hues in places. Rich toasty tan head. Flavors of toasted malts, toffee, coffee and cream� but all fairly light and pale. Bread and crackers up front, then a fluid, wet yeast flavor in the watery finish.
Courage Dark Mild;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Mild Ale;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);well this fellow is actually 3.2% woo hoo, eh thats the highlight guyz. Well fine then, fuck off..............
Courage Dark Mild;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Mild Ale;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);"May, 2003 Keg, Wheatsheaf, Sittingbourne. I was heading for a pub I knew, but was drawn to this one because of the sign saying ""Built 1778 - A Real Ale Pub"". Once inside I noticed that the only cask ale they had was Master Brew. Damn. However, they did have this. Keg it may be, but it is a mild, and this is the deep South. A rare find. It certainly looks like a mild and, surprisingly for a Courage keg, it tastes like a mild. It�s been served too cold, but it does have a gentle sweetness backed up by a little roasted barley and licorice. Very tasty. There is a little off-putting tingle from the gas carbonation, but otherwise I was impressed. [2.9] Oct, 2006Hen & Chickens, Chatham - an ex-Truman pub. Gentle roasty mild tasting mild. Rather attractive. Keg it may be. Courage it may be. But it tastes good. [2.8]"
Avesta National;Fors, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Avesta Bryggeri;Sampled draught at Svensk Fat�lsfestival, Nyn�shamn Pale yelloew with rich head. Sweet malt dominates. This lager feels fresh, but slightly papery and has a grassy bitterish finish. Unremarkable, but certainly drinkable.
N�rke Svensk�l;�rebro, Sweden;Smoked - Rauchbier;N�rke Kulturbryggeri;(Draught at Rover, G�teborg) Smokey malt with some american hops. N�rke has better smoked beers to offer.

N�rke Svensk�l;�rebro, Sweden;Smoked - Rauchbier;N�rke Kulturbryggeri;Keg @ Akkkurat, Stockholm 9 September 2005 Nice subdued smokey aroma. Quite full bodied with licorice, dark fruits and chocolate flavour. I think this beer is still under development from this small brewer and changes from batch to batch. Still, it�s a very nice and well balanced brew with a good hoppy/smokey aftertaste. Me like.
N�rke Svensk�l;�rebro, Sweden;Smoked - Rauchbier;N�rke Kulturbryggeri;Slightly artificial but pleasant citric nose - like a soda popsicle. Cloudy brown. Citric fruit center, a bit spice. Quite nice.

Flossmoor Station Le Chi�n Blanc;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draft on tap at the brewpub (Flossmoor, IL). Stopped in to try the new sour and tried this for free. A recipe I remember from my high school days as a busser, but never tried. I guess Todd�s trip back is what I owe this to, oddly. Pours a murky hazy golden hue, a good haze with a moderate frothy white head, laces well with a thicker layer. Aromas are orange peel, citrus, and coriander. Touches of spice mix with bread dough, flaked wheat, and mellow yeast. Crisp and refreshing, well balanced with a good mellow orange bite. Into the end lingering coriander, sun tan lotion, and dry flaked wheat offers bread dough, touches of light hops. Sweeter, citrusy, and fairly clean on the finish with lingering spice. Nice and fresh. Enjoyable, as much as I don�t want to admit it.
Flossmoor Station Le Chi�n Blanc;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Nice job on a style that is not really my favorite. This refreshing wheat has an appealing cloudy pour, with a strong brisk orange-lemon citrus flavor and bright acidic finish. Good winter wheat.
Flossmoor Station Le Chi�n Blanc;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Strangely, they�ve never had this on tap as Flossmoor when I�m there. I had it at the Maple Tree Inn (a great place for brews) in Blue Island a couple of times. Nice light hazy yellow with a respectable head. A floral, grassy aroma with a bready yeast smell. A full mouth-feel with a citric taste and mild spicing. A truly excellent drink. Maple Tree Inn, Blue Island, IL
Flossmoor Station Le Chi�n Blanc;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Tap: Light cloudy yellow - like fresh pineapple orange juice.

Flossmoor Station Le Chi�n Blanc;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Very opaque - just what I like to see in a wheat beer.

Flossmoor Station Le Chi�n Blanc;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Cloudy yellow with small white head. Aroma is banana, light lemon, wheat, medium sweet. Taste is light sweet, wheat, lemon, and trace of banana. Light body.
Flossmoor Station Le Chi�n Blanc;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draft...RBSG2003... Murky, pear juice-colored beer. Small, creamy white head with great lacework. The aroma is of banana and clove, coriander, orange peel, bubble gum and butter. Perfectly-balanced flavor. Fruity and spicy up front. Astringent and lightly pungent on the backside. Very refreshing! Light-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and light carbonation. Not even close to being my favorite style, but a very good, high quality wit nonetheless!

Flossmoor Station Le Chi�n Blanc;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;With a beautiful, cloudy lemony appearance and a fresh, fresh mildly sweet aroma, I was expecting something special. But the taste didn't quite deliver - it seemed a bit flat. But the professor in me thinks it has potential, if it would just apply itself!

Goachers Best Dark Ale;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goachers;"Cask at the ""Southern Ale Adventure"" Beer Festival at the Prince of Wales, Farnborough. Interesting to see that this hasn�t been rated for a while, so presumably it�s making a comeback - to me, this is everything an English bitter should be. It�s a bright chestnut colour with a loose cream head; the taste is a spectacular combination of Kentish hops and treacle toffee; leading to a dry finish. A really satisfying pint."
Goachers Best Dark Ale;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goachers;14th July 2011 Chelmsford Beer Festival. Hazy darkish brown beer. Suddy white head. Light semi dry palate. Fresh malts - mild chocolate and a little coffee. Nicely balanced by mild dark orangey hop. Semi dry finish. Bitter aftertaste.
Goachers Best Dark Ale;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goachers;Cask, Kings Head, Kingsdown, Kent. Dark reddish brown looks with a slight beige head. Fairly subdued sweet malt aroma. Largely unremarkable malt driven flavour. A little thin and watery with some hop bitterness towards the finish. Drinkable, but not especially worth lingering over.

Goachers Best Dark Ale;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goachers;Cask conditioned at The Kent Beer Fest, Canterbury. Copper colour with white head. Slightly honeyed toffee tasting beer with a rich malt and quite sweetish. Honey nut loops in the finish, quite unexpected.

Goachers Best Dark Ale;Maidstone, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goachers;Cask, gravity, at Wellington Arms, Bedford, in the Welly Winter Festival of Ale. Dark amber- brown. Hairy malt aroma. Sweet malty taste, nicely balanced with a mid bitter finish. Good one.
Winthrop Jims Awesome IPA;Winthrop, Washington, United States;IPA;Winthrop Brewing Company;The head brewer brought a dry-hopped version of this to a bar here in Bellingham along with a few other kegs. This has a definitive fresh-cut grass aroma that is really remarkable. This with a sharply citrusy flavor that actually doesn�t overload your taste buds with high IBUs makes this a very solid effort. The shy IBU is in no way a sacrifice of flavor, but rather the other way around - similar to the LaConner DH. My only qualm here is a slight lack in mouthfeel as the beer seems to drip off the palate before a finish can really take hold. Aside from this slightly watery character the beer is surely a solid output from the brewery - according to the brewer, the dry-hopping is a deviation from the recipe but surely one that should become permanent.
Winthrop Jims Awesome IPA;Winthrop, Washington, United States;IPA;Winthrop Brewing Company;Nice copper color. Head sticks around pretty well. Nice hoppy aroma. A bit light bodied for the style but a good brew none the less. Very quaffable. Good hoppy finish (Cascade, Culumbus mix). I think I had about 5 pints.
Lucky Number High Gravity Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can. Pours a clear golden color with a small white head. Has a fruity malty sweetish grainy aroma. Sweetish grainy corn flavor. Has a sweetish malty grainy finish.
Lucky Number High Gravity Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Sample at SRBG. Pours a clear pale gold with an average white head. Aroma of malt, grain (corn), and metal. Taste is the same. Ugh.
Lucky Number High Gravity Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can @ Presidential Suite. Thanks, Sean. Clear golden pour with a white head. Smells like total garbage. Like actual trash. Soap, corn syrup, cooked vegetables, corn, and banana. Really metallic, too. Gross. Flavor is quite sweet but also extremely vegetal and metallic. Apple juice and banana esters. Certainly boozy, too.
Lucky Number High Gravity Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can shared at the RBSG presidential suite malt liquor extravaganza. Thanks, assholes! Pours a pale gold with a small white head. Pretty clean, actually - pale malts, corn, sugar, and minerals. Light-bodied, with a sweet mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Not too much going on. Good for drinking while loitering outside 7-11, hiding it in a paper bag, waiting for some other shit to do.
Lucky Number High Gravity Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can at RBSG. Malt Liquor night. Pours clear yellow. Nose/taste of lemon, alcohol and harsh metallic grain. Medium bodied.
Lucky Number High Gravity Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can, big thanks to homer321. Clear golden orange color. Thin off-white head. Leaves good bits of lace. Medium to bigger body. Kind of crisp lighter carbonation, lightly crisp, but light rough edge to it. Moderate bready taste, some corn. Little bite in the finish. OK stuff. Rougher than other malt liquors I tasted tonight. Couldn�t finish my tiny sample. Kind of harsh. Ehh.. Roughest beer I�ve had in awhile.
Lucky Number High Gravity Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);@ the pussy palace. Pours a pretty clear golden appearance with a white head. Candy corn, sweet, hay aroma. Pretty fucken sweet flavor. Cotton candy and bubble gum prevalent. Too sweet for my taste.
Lucky Number High Gravity Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can share thanks to Homer321 via Francis. Fairly clear orange color, white head, seems pretty @ tame. Fruity, malty, sweet, almost citrusy note, more apple fruity character comes through as is sits. Very fruity, juicy, sweet, apple juice, semisweet, notable alcohol flavor in finish. Might be a wave.
Lucky Number High Gravity Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can thanks to frank. Nose is slightly rotten fruit with some table sugar. Hazy pour and small white head. A ton of pepper and alcohol in the flavor. Kinda bad for a malt liquor. A lot if residual sweetness and candy.
Lucky Number High Gravity Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"This beer is a sad void into which the hopeless sink and never return. It reeks of over-ripe apples and straight-out poison. Before I even smelled it directly, just catching the aroma from afar, it sent pangs of nausea through my gut. Up close, it is actually almost a little better; the apple note becomes more cidery and the poison note, more subdued. Still, I was deeply, deeply frightened at the prospect of actually drinking this garbage. Doing so reveals a taste more or less like those foamy circus peanut candies, which is to say it tastes like stale cotton candy and nothingness. As it warms--and I do not recommend letting this happen--the sweetness builds allowing this grievous mistake of a beer to linger on the surface of the tongue. This beer is not only bad but actively malicious. It will not let you forget it. With each sip, I hate myself a little more, making the next sip of this strong and vile elixer both more necessary and more harrowing. Whatever though. Never tried it before and a rate�s a rate."
British Waterways Navigation Ale;Selby, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brown Cow Brewery;Bottle conditioned. Pale gold, good white head and moderate condition. Big fluffy yeast sediment. Initial aroma is worryingly sulphurous but this almost dissapears in the mouth. Good mix of sweet malt and hop flavours with a creamy vanilla note lurking and a distant egginess. Aftertaste develops a good level of hop bitterness. Ignore the aroma (if possible) and you will find a surprisingly pleasant and refreshing pale bitter.
Boundary Bay Scotch Ale - Highland Reserve;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Boundary Bay Brewery;From Bottle - pours caramel brown with a malty sweet aroma and a hint of smoked peat. My first sip is sweet with a bit of smokiness at the back. Aftertatse is toffee. Quite good!
Boundary Bay Scotch Ale - Highland Reserve;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Boundary Bay Brewery;6 oz. sample on tap at the brewpub, pours a hazy dark amber with a small beige head. Aroma of scotch, caramel, maple syrup - no hop presence. Flavour of caramel, non-boozy scotch (de-alcoholized scotch, so to speak), maple syrup, with a pleasant sweetness level that doesn�t cloy. Well-made and superior to their regular scotch ale I�d say.
Boundary Bay Scotch Ale - Highland Reserve;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Boundary Bay Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Pours a dark shade of amber with a trim beige head. Smells and tastes of black licorice, toasted malt, toffee, and peat. Totally decent.

Boundary Bay Scotch Ale - Highland Reserve;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Boundary Bay Brewery;Pours hazy dark amber with a dense off-white head. Aroma of smoke-infused caramel. Sweet, lightly smoky caramel, nuts and all manner of malty goodness. This one really hit the spot.
Boundary Bay Scotch Ale - Highland Reserve;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Boundary Bay Brewery;"Thanks go out to thethrone for this bottle I poured it into a snifter and it produced a finger worth of white head that turned to a thick lace. The body was a burgandy brown when held to the light Nice malty nose touch of dark fruits and a light roasted note filled my head. The flavor followed the nose to a ""T"" the medium body with good carbonation. Quite drinkable, nice kick back and relax brew which is what I want right now. Thanks again Throne"
Boundary Bay Scotch Ale - Highland Reserve;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Boundary Bay Brewery;Draft. Poured a storm cloud gray body with hints of amber and a frothy off-white head. Aroma was smokey roast barley, caramel malt, and slightly coniferous. Flavor was again smokey roast barley, sweet caramel malt, and slightly piney. Palate was somewhat weak bodied and finished a little too phenolic. Overall still a good scotch ale.

Vernon, WA--Poured a thick deep chestnut-brown body with a fluffy beige-tan head. Smokey, malty, gritty, chewy, spicily hopped nose. Rich, sticky, piny, sugary flavor. Complex, great sipping brew. Love BB!

Boundary Bay Dry Porter;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Porter;Boundary Bay Brewery;Cask: Deep brown with loose tan head.Lightly toasted nose. Light roasted flavor with dry malt finish. A thin porter, made to seem even thinner by the cask. Ok, but a poor choice for cask
Sockeye White Pine Pilsener;Boise, Idaho, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sockeye Brewing;Pours a golden yellow with a white head. Aromas of bread/malts/hops. Crisp flavor with hints of hop/malt.
Sockeye White Pine Pilsener;Boise, Idaho, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sockeye Brewing;Draft: Yellow pour with a medium white head and light lacing. Nose is mild of yeast, breadiness, and fruit? The taste confirms a hint of fruits with light breadiness and hints of bitters. Different than I expected, but not bad.
Sockeye White Pine Pilsener;Boise, Idaho, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sockeye Brewing;Truly there was just not very much too this beer. Light and almost sour grainy aroma, which follows into the mouthfeel that is almost what I would think this came out of a green bottle. Perhaps they have developed some kind of new filtration system, which passes the beer through a green bottle and sunlight to create this really unimpressive beer.
Sockeye White Pine Pilsener;Boise, Idaho, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sockeye Brewing;Almost non existant aroma. The typical hazy gold pilsener appearance. Flavor was musky and not very friendly on the palate. Very unimpressive from this usually good microbrewery.
Olde Burnside Highland Fling Spring Ale;East Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Burnside Brewing Co.;Lightly cloudy golden color with a fizzy cream colored head. Clean tangy hops dominated this beer offset just enough by light yeast. Maybe some very light fruity overtones. Nice blue glass bottle and resealable top... probably the best thing about this beer.
Olde Burnside Highland Fling Spring Ale;East Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Burnside Brewing Co.;Cold 33.8 oz blue swing top bottle: Pours a clear golden amber with very minimal ivory bubbles. Aroma is of apple and hops. Fizzy on the tongue. Taste is mainly bitter with notes of fruit. Moderately bitter aftertaste.
Olde Burnside Highland Fling Spring Ale;East Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Burnside Brewing Co.;Large blue swingtop bottle: Pours lightly cloudy light orange with a thick white head, aroma has apples, flowers and earthy hops, full bodied for the style, nice strong carbonation, long grainy ending, starts and ends lightly bitter.
Olde Burnside Highland Fling Spring Ale;East Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Burnside Brewing Co.;slight hints of fruityness to the nose, Very light golden in color light body, well balanced and yes, it is refreshing.
Olde Burnside Highland Fling Spring Ale;East Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Burnside Brewing Co.;I have to agree with most of what has been posted on this light, tasty ale. Again, I buy it fresh since it is a local brewer. I share it with my friends who are �afraid� of craft brews, they love it.
Olde Burnside Highland Fling Spring Ale;East Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Burnside Brewing Co.;Pours out coppery with a white head. Smells of bread, nuts, grapefruit and sugar. Tastes appley with some mellow spicey notes. Great think lively mouthfeel.
Olde Burnside Highland Fling Spring Ale;East Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Burnside Brewing Co.;"2005 1L swingtop bottle, quite beautiful as all have said. A very sparkling, shining golden appearance, a deep, true golden color, with just a hint of light copper. Very hazy, with sediment suspended in minute particles all throughout the glass, I really love when that occurs. Creamy, yellow-flecked white head. Very well-retained and leaves immense sheets of lace plastered to the glass. Aroma of sugar cookies, nutty hops, very earthy and lightly bitter. Light floral notes and some lemon sorbet with honey on it. Begins with a big, sticky bitterness, that clings to the tongue, backed up by some notes reminding me of orange-blossom honey. Very pleasing, creamy mouthfeel, fresh and unfiltered. Ends very dry and bitter, as magic_hat says, it has a bit too much on the bittering and not quite enough hops flavor. Lots going on on the finish, but it�s mostly hops driven; peppery, soily, nutty notes from the boiled hops with some light toasty malt, almost worty-sweet. Some light flowers and honey linger, and the hops bitterness steadily builds on the palate, really dulling the other flavors by the end of the bottle. No alcohol apparency, with a dusty, lightly dirty (not in a bad way) yeastiness. Well-made beer, but let�s have less hops bitterness and more hops flavor."
Olde Burnside Highland Fling Spring Ale;East Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Burnside Brewing Co.;This is a pretty good Spring Pale ale, but it has room for improvement. The bittering hops are a little too intense, and it could use some finishing hops to cover up a little. This is borderlining an IPA. Good malt backbone, a nice fairly dry beer. A little unbalanced, but good none the less. And I love the 1 liter swing top bottles, great for us homebrewers.
Olde Burnside Highland Fling Spring Ale;East Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Burnside Brewing Co.;Bottle #1881. Bottle opens with a thunderous pop. Pour is a very carbonated one with a big light tan fluffy head. Mildly hazy amber/honey color. Citrus orange aroma with hints of honey, pepper, and notes of smoked pine. Yeastly banana to start. Gives way to intense hoppy bitterness. Lots of Cascades in the finish. Orange hints in the middle. Good Stuff!
Olde Burnside Highland Fling Spring Ale;East Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Olde Burnside Brewing Co.;Bottle #1718, The never ending frothy head, nice lacying, with a copper amber appearance. Very fragrant with herbal & floral aromas and a hint of lemon. Medium bodied with a ton of hops. I could of used more malt complexity but a very good beer. Another fine seasonal by Olde Burnside.
Celis White (Belgian);Ertvelde, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;St Stefanus Blanche version from Waitrose in a 330ml stubby bottle. A fairly ordinary wit beer. Disappointing considering the St Stefanus Blonde is a lovely beer, but then now I realise it's a just a branding excise.
Celis White (Belgian);Ertvelde, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;St Stephanus Blanche version that I have bought at one monoprix, at Paris. Tasting it at Paris, in my hotel room, the last year. The color is yellow and troubled, normal carbonation, white foam. Personally, it is not my favourite witbier, industrial flavour, syrup of glucose, sweet, fruity, you get some whear, few hop, it is not subtle and well balanced.
Celis White (Belgian);Ertvelde, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Somewhat cloudy poor, big white foam head. Some banana in aroma, barley in taste. (Velp 201909)
Celis White (Belgian);Ertvelde, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;St.Stefanus Blanche, bottle from Waitrose. It was OK - didn't really taste entirely like what I'd expect of a blanche, quite a rich taste to it. OK though.
Mighty Oak Simply The Best;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask. Pours hazy golden with a White head. Aroma fruity hops, lemony, slight malty - Caramel, light foral. Taste is bitter, with some citrus, light bready, and some grassy to it.
Mighty Oak Simply The Best;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask (handpump) at the Cask Pub & Kitchen on 17 January 2011 - meet the brewer night, with 10 Mighty Oak beers on tap. Thought I�d rated this before so notes rather sketchy. Bright copper. Good condition. A solid best bitter with a decent balance of caramel & berry fruit tinged malt and spicy hops. Just a touch of citrus. Moderate bitterness. No complaints here but I generally prefer my session beers to be a bit more hop driven.
Mighty Oak Simply The Best;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;21st August 2007 Warning! Early amateur rating! Low carbonation. Fruity start. Lingering bitter finish. Okay.
Kingsbury;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;WHY? WHY DID I EVER DRINK THIS? Get me a BLATZ ASAP! Somehow this stuff passed my lips 20 odd years ago, and I have never forgotten or forgiven!
Kingsbury;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;From a 12-oz can pours a clear light golden yellow colored brew with a fast dissolving white head that dissipates clean. Aroma of corn grits, floral hops and some breakfast cereal. Taste is light bodied, very metallic, with a morning corn flake breakfast cereal. Finish is quite gritty, corn aftertaste and more metallic aftertaste. Another historical beer brand that is not even a shadow of its glory years. Would like to have tried the Kingsbury Pale Lager of the early 1950s when it was real beer.
Kingsbury;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;Can bought in Japan. Thin yellow colour, hardly any head. Herby grainy unpleasant aroma. Watery mouthfeel. Sweetish grainy herby thin unpleasant flavour
Kingsbury;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;True this may have been a sub par beer but i am sure many people like myself from the town it is from remember sneaking their first KB out of their dads fridge. So it holds a special place in my heart.
Kingsbury;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;Realy not the worset (?) beer out therr. Yes it is on the light side, Light but not watery.
Kingsbury;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;Something is wrong with me this Beer was okay to me. I went to the doctor and asked about it He just shook his head in disbelief. I guest I can be proud that I like the poorest rated beer on the planet.
Chumleys Heathers Honey Lager;New York, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Chumleys;Quite possibly the star of the show down at Chumleys Pub. A very sweet lager with low carbonation makes for a pleasant loungin' afternoon at Chumley's while the Pub's house chocolate lab coughs incessantly like it's got a hairball down its throat. Oh well, Chumley's is nonetheless a charming dive of a former 1920s speakeasy that serves nine beers brewed for it by Chelsea Brewing and this honey lager is one of the beers worthy of a taste. Possessing a hint of citrusy goodness, this lager is mild and inoffensive.
Rubens Goud;Jumet, Belgium;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brasserie de l'Union - Alken-Maes (Heineken);From old tasting notes. Brassy gold color. Big rocky white head. Mild malt nose hints at thyme. subtle malt flavor with hints of honey.mlightly carbonation. Refreshing.
Rubens Goud;Jumet, Belgium;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brasserie de l'Union - Alken-Maes (Heineken);Someone found this one in its cellar, vintage 1994, so 11 years old. Gold yellow colour, with a small white head, quiet a lot of carbonation, so it doesn�t seems dead afther all this time. Rather skunky aroma, light madeirisation, some fruityness left. Flat body and a flat finish, with an old-bitter strange ending which is not really enjoyable. After all, still interesting for a beer of 4.3% after all those years
Roughrider Premium;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Old grain, faint dusty hop aroma. Very grainy and chunky in the mouth. A bit unclean and wet at the finish. A rather tasteless experience. Claims to be brewed by the Dakota brewing co. but it�s actually brewed in Minnesota. ND needs to get with the beer revolution and craft their own brew. Hopefully one better than this.
Roughrider Premium;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Bottle: Had after fishing a couple days, basically a lawnmower beer. I was a little disappointed, I thought this was from ND, because the case said Dakota Brewing company and made no other mention of state, but it is actually from MN. A little hoppy, crisp. Nothing special.
Roughrider Premium;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;I don�t get it! Everone in the town I�m in is buying this stuff like its a real beer! Its way to light, and frankly way to blah! Pass it up like a stripper with a rash!
Roughrider Premium;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Pale yellow in color with little to no head. Aroma is sweet with notes of grain or corn. Flavor is sweet and malt, watery. It tastes a little off, not much hop presence. My bottle says it made by Dakota Brewing Company - Cold Springs, Minn.
Roughrider Premium;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Nearly no head at all and what was there faded pretty fast.Mildly malty sweet aroma,with a mild hop presence.The flavor was relatively the same as the aroma.malty sweet,low carbonation,slightly hopped.the after taste was nothing special mostly water a little malt and hops.over all it's a pretty basic poorly done brew.
B&T Mad Hatter;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;B&T Brewery;A - citrus and floral A - mid gold and frothy T - sour P - mid to thin O - ehh...
B&T Mad Hatter;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;B&T Brewery;Tasted this in The Esquire House, Glasgow (JDW) in June 2010. Cask, handpump dispense. Crystal clear pale copper in colour with a thin white head. Short aroma of thin crisp apple. Thin mouthfeel and poor lacing. Thin pale malt base gives digestive biscuit with dried raisin fruit. Thin bodied aftertaste is dry and metallic. Tang of hop resins continue into the dry bitter finish with oak wood tanins. An ok session bitter but nothing exceptional.
B&T Mad Hatter;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;B&T Brewery;Cask @ Bon Accord. Copper colour, off-white head. Aroma is caramel malts, bit of fruits. Flavour is caramel malts, fruits. Slightly bitter and dry.
B&T Mad Hatter;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;B&T Brewery;Cask @ The Bon Accord. Medium brown colour, not much head. Toffee malt aroma & flavour with some ash. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Very average bitter.
B&T Mad Hatter;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;B&T Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) at Wandsworth Common Beer Festival @ Le Gothique on 25 March 2011. Amber colour. No head to speak of. Quite fruity and rather sweet. Hop presence in the flavour is quite modest. Soft mouthfeel. Nothing particularly wrong with it but too sweet and short of bite for my taste - could do with pepping up a bit.
B&T Mad Hatter;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;B&T Brewery;Cask at Turf Tavern, Oxford. Lasting medium smooth foam. Red-cupper color. Dry wood/pine needle hop aroma. Nice English hop taste that lasts long time. There is also fruit esthers and a litle caramell. Alltogether an good refreshing beer with a balanced bitternes.
B&T Mad Hatter;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;B&T Brewery;[Cask at the Back of Beyond] Light amber, moderate white head, slight fizz (superb condition - well done Wetherspoons!). Apple and caramel at first followed by a tasty spiciness. Straw and earth come through in a moderately bitter finish that is well balanced against the sweet start. Decent bitter - although obviously very variable in both quality and flavour based on earlier reviews!
B&T Mad Hatter;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;B&T Brewery;Cask conditioned? at a Wetherspoons. Amber with slight head. this tasted old, tired and frankly a little off. Spoons at its worst unfortunately. Floral fruity, tart and poor.
B&T Mad Hatter;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;B&T Brewery;"Cask at the Back of Beyond (JDW), Reading. Gold with a dense cream head; clean grainy aroma; fresh, sweet, grassy, flavour; lacking finish. A rather basic bitter."
B&T Mad Hatter;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;B&T Brewery;Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. Amber with a small white head. Sweet malt aroma with some pear fruit coming through. Fresh citric tatse with just enough bitterness in the finish. Another tasty, easy drinking session beer, which B & T do so well.
Hair of the Frog Centennial Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hair of the Frog;"Very mild hop notes and also little carbonation. For something labeled ""centennial"" I would expect more hop, as is the case with Founder's Centennial IPA. Maybe they aren't referring to hops, I'm not sure."
Anheuser World Lager (World Select);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Bottle, in US. Backlog entry. Entering my historic scores for US beers whilst visiting New York. No tasting notes kept, just rating.
Anheuser World Lager (World Select);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"A little bit more malts and hops than their regular offerings; otherwise it was still a fairly generic pale lager at inflated prices. Drinkable but the price is telling why its no longer made."
Anheuser World Lager (World Select);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);12oz bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a clear golden with a decent head. Aroma of grains, hops, and hay. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew is not bad as I was expecting worse coming from a green bottle.
Anheuser World Lager (World Select);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Reviewed from notes. Pours a clear golden with a thin white head and little lacing. Nose brings forth some grain and a bit of some Czech/German hops. Taste is about the same, with a bit of grain but mostly just faint hops and some carbonation. Light feel with a good amount of carbonation to carry what little flavor there is. Drinks okay, but probably has a bit too much carbonation and not much real flavor. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 10-08-2010
Anheuser World Lager (World Select);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"At least they included the whole world in naming this beer instead of just naming America. This has a pretty smooth flavor with a skunky aftertaste. Luckily I didn�t have to pay for my encouter with this watered down ""select"" beer"

Anheuser World Lager (World Select);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I�ll keep this one nice and short. It basically tastes like a watered down Heineken. Maybe even a little more skunked tasting.
Anheuser World Lager (World Select);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"Had this one 3 years ago, and I didnt write this one down, so Im going a little off memory. Tasted just a liitle bit better than straw tea, but thats what most pale lagers taste like. Im not sure what makes this the world select....Oh, its the ""fancier"" bottle. Not saying it was terrible, just not ""select"". (Who selected it?)"
Anheuser World Lager (World Select);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);WOW, this really is world class, world class crap. Poured a light yellow color with a white head. Aroma was pretty minimal, bready and grass. Flavor was really watery, grassy and a slight bitter corn flavor as well.

Otter Creek Vermont Lager;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otter Creek Brewing;Bottle with some heads in philly. Orange golden color with average head. Nose and flavor are pure trash with some skunk, oxidized hops, weird herbs, dumpster, and belgian fruit. Pretty much everything that could go wrong with this, did. Terrible drain pour
Otter Creek Vermont Lager;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otter Creek Brewing;From a bottle slightly hazy pale lager, almost clear. Has a decent recognizable lager aroma. Taste on the other hand is big old country pilsner sharpness. Yes, little kick in there. Unexpected considering, this was labeled as a friendly lager, and it smelled like one too. Good solid pilsner fer sure. Pretty close to the old german country.
Otter Creek Vermont Lager;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otter Creek Brewing;Decent pale golden pour w/ a thin white head & good lacing. The aroma is mild & kind of soapy. The taste is fairly harsh w/out much flavoring. I can get it down but this isn�t something I would want to have again!
Otter Creek Vermont Lager;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otter Creek Brewing;12 Fl. Oz. Bottle. Poured clear, yellow with a nice size head, and lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma of grain and hops. Taste is semi sweet, grain some malts combined with a very nice bitterness from hops. Quite refreshing, very drinkable.
Otter Creek Vermont Lager;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otter Creek Brewing;Cloudy straw yellow color with white head. Aroma of lemon and grass. Grain, hint of pepper with lemon. Pretty decent pilsner.
Otter Creek Vermont Lager;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otter Creek Brewing;Bright gold appearance with an average size white head and a fair amount of lacing. Grain field aroma dotted with citrusy hops. Bitter, dry, acidic taste modestly balanced by biscuit-like malts with a crisp, peppery, herbal aftertaste. Medium bodied, decently carbonated mouthfeel leads to a short lived finish.
Otter Creek Vermont Lager;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otter Creek Brewing;Bottle at home in CT - picked up in VT. Pours crystal clear yellow with a foamy white head. Clean cereal on the nose with hints of corn, grass and lemon rind. Light-medium sweet flavor with biscuity malts, further cereal, some bitter hay and grass, faint lemon zest, crackers. Light bodied with average carbonation. Finishes with nice balance, further crackers and biscuits, slight dry and grassy bitterness. Very drinkable lager,
Otter Creek Vermont Lager;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otter Creek Brewing;A very bitter lager with a slightly sweet aftertaste. Hints of grapefruit and citrus zest. Not particularly malty for a lager. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Otter Creek Vermont Lager;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otter Creek Brewing;Definitely more pilsner than lager, lots (too much?) of refreshing bitterness but I find it a bit too much for summer beer.
Otter Creek Vermont Lager;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otter Creek Brewing;Pale muted orange. Creamy white head. Light lavender sweet honey and corn nose. Creamy mouthfeel. Bitter orange peel, sweet pie crust and astringent bitter finish. I still like it quite a bit. A less juicy humulus lager
James Page Northern Lights Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;Another recovered rating from the cabin up north... Pours light brown with minimal head. Earthy aroma mixed with spice and sugar. Flavor is citrusy hop with a dose of caramel sweet.
James Page Northern Lights Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;"Bottled.Average sized frothy ecru colored head that tried to stick around but eventually fell to a thin layer; some spotty lacing remained. Nice malty aroma redolent of toasted grain and some brown sugar along with a bit of citrusy hops. Flavor upfront was of sweet caramel malt that carried through to mid-palate where a toasted grain-slightly burnt pastry crust character emerged. Hop character also emerged mid-palate; the hop flavor faded by the finish and only the bitterness remained long into the aftertaste. Palate seemed light bodied and somewhat watery. Refreshing and drinkable enough but I�m not so sure about the burnt pastry crust note and the seemingly watered down feel of this bock. I would still accept one though if offered. Thanks Slikwily!"
James Page Northern Lights Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;Clear coppery color Firm, bubbly, off-white head, if a bit brief. Aroma: fresh, zesty, grassy, clean, herbal, vegetal, and sweet. Spicy, traces of toffee, subtle alcohol, a bit medicinal, with a turbulent sweetness. On the palate, a syrupy sweetness up front. A good, gripping, tasty body and texture. Nice taste, medium body, good, sweet finish. Dries up quick, though. Caramelly sweetness rides through. A decent, but unremarkable bock.
James Page Northern Lights Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;Deep copper/amber colour. Mild malty aroma with a slight hoppiness. Flavour is mild and pleasant too but not particularly interesting. A very drinkable bock (actually I wouldn't mind having quite a few of these)...
James Page Northern Lights Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;Aroma of malt. Light brown with no head. Flavor...I could swear this is Sam Adams. Does calling it a bock make it a bock? I say no.
James Page Northern Lights Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;Decent caramel, and chocolate flavor. Mild and sweet body with good bock profile. Smooth and very drinkable.
James Page Northern Lights Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;Not a bad Bock. Thanks Slikwily. Orangish, brown. Malts & hops mix well in the aroma. Flavor is pretty sweet. The finish is dry and somewhat sour.
James Page Northern Lights Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;Voluminous, seafoam head, PA colored brew, acid-flashback cowboy label. Very lagered maltfunki aroma. Some acidic caramel malt twang without much else going on. Medium-light sweetness. Twangy, cidery, long acidic finish. Needs help.
James Page Northern Lights Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;No real aroma to this - has a nice thick white head with a lot of lacing. Light copper colored appearance. The flavor was not as malty as most bocks - tastes and feels more like an amber lager. Smooth drinking though - goes down well - stays strong to the finish. Would be good for session purposes.
James Page Northern Lights Bock;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stevens Point Brewery;Heavy amber color with a small lid of antler colored suds. Sweet caramel malt and brown sugar aroma. Hints of alcohol and mild floral/dry grass hops. Sweet malty start with a buttered toast finish. In between there are some light fruits (raisins, pears and peaches). Not to heavily fruity to distract. Thick feel on the tongue, but light on the finish. Mildly acidic in the late finish which helps cleanse some of maltiness away and leaves you with a dry finish for the style. Kudos to slikwily for forwarding this one on to me. A very drinkable bock.
Three Needs Mexican Vienna;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Fresh grainy nose, deep burnt orange color. Smooth sweet caramel malt with notes of nuts. Dull broad hopped with with a tingly spicy note (not to much). Good balance and full body. Nice.
Three Needs Mexican Vienna;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Draught pint at the brewery with Muzzlehatch on 3/11/06 Deep milk-chocolate brown, with some lighter hay-yellow highlights and much a muddy sea through the middle, but the colors lighten on the edges and the clarity becomes only lightly cloudy. Head is intially full and beige on this one, but again, it recedes fairly steadily to a ring, with only a film left on the glass. Smells of thick yeast, heavy caramelized sugars and some buttercream, with some light almond/hazelnuttiness and a sour, munich-like maltiness on the end. Moderate strength. Upon first sip, it�s quite a bit to take in. Another heavy (dare I say TOO unfiltered) texture places thick, caramelized malts all over the palate, while a light bit of honey mixes with graham cracker sweetness and then wanes yeasty. Too much yeast, yet not nearly enough attenuation (some type of sugar addition perhaps). I don�t know if this one still aimed for the ""Mexican Coffee"", there were light coffee notes from the darker brown malts, I suppose, but it just plasters the palate with sugars and yeast and does come off a bit worty. I was really hoping for a Vienna, which this seems to be nothing like. No alcohol apparency, low to moderate carbonation, chewy, sugary texture."
Three Needs Mexican Vienna;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"OK, so this is supposed to be a ""spiced"" Vienna; this is supposed to have a subtle combination of ""Mexican coffee"" spicing (cinnamon, white pepper, chocolate etc) to complement the malty smokiness of the basic Vienna recipe. Except this is being consumed in an airless, smoky, dank pub where its impossible to get any subtleties of anything. Maybe a hint, if you put all of your limited cranial capacity into it. Nnnahh the beer ain't worth it. Next please."
Vermont Pub Beetlejuice Hefeweizen;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Vermont Pub & Brewery;On tap @ Vermont Pub & Brewery. Cloudy pale straw pour with a soapy white foam. Pretty much just a basic Hefeweizen here. Some banana, a bit of lemon, and a light clove note. Subtle cracker and biscuit. Kind of sweet, maybe a touch tangy. Pretty light overall. I guess it�s fine. Not really much going on here.
Vermont Pub Beetlejuice Hefeweizen;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Sample on tap at brewpub. Aroma is of yeast, cloves, and bananas. Nothing spectacular, but refreshing enough.

Behind golden malts with banana notes. 5- Appearance Top: white fine cap, mid sized Base: hazy amber-gold. Palate : soft, easy going with softer carbonation. Medium bodied with average finish. Taste:almost none hop presence. Blend of wheat and golden malts. Straight and fairly clean. Other notes Average Weiss, beyond poor aroma it was OK.
Vermont Pub Beetlejuice Hefeweizen;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Vermont Pub & Brewery;The aroma is like an old, sour rag. Not very appealing. It has a touch of fruitiness to it, somewhat reminiscent of a cherry cough drop. It has a bit too much body and is lacking in carbonation. I feel like they could do better.
Vermont Pub Beetlejuice Hefeweizen;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Vermont Pub & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pale yellow with a nice white head. Light sourness, banana, wheat, very faint cloves. Moderate carbonation and mild body, nice finish.

Barrington Dunkel;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Weak caramel nose, some roastiness in the flavor, very low sweetness, slightly acidic finish, dry, just ok.
Barrington Scottish Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Poured into an English pint glass, the appearance was a fairly dark burnt orange color with a finger�s worth of white foamy head that died off in a slow way. Light lace. The aroma had some candied fruits, subtle earthy hops, light tobacco, and some sweet herbal qualities. Caramel malts somewhat seem far underneath. The flavor yields to the malts, somewhat bready to roasty and then those candied fruits with the herbal and earthiness flowing in for some balance. Lingering robust malty aftertaste with a crisp malty finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Herbal and earthy tones seem to play against the carbonation for a good normal feel for a Scottish ale. Overall, without the peatiness, I�d say this was still nice all around. I could have again for me, definitely one for the colder months.
Barrington Scottish Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Bomber into a glass. Pours a caramel orange ruby. Head is of medium body, does not retain and mellows fast. Tan brown in color, faint lacing, decent carb bubbles. Aroma of sweet and chewy malts, granola, salt, sour apple, candied dates, mild dark fruits. Taste of sweet and sticky malts, orange, plum somewhere, or dates, amber waves, more malt feedback, and some booze though abv is a mystery. Fun drinking brew, soft on the pallate with a great sweet fruit aftertaste. Drinks easier than it looks. Great for this awful winter.
Barrington Scottish Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Cask at the brewpub - Great Barrington. Pours amber-gold with a creamy tan head. Dried berries in the nose with bready malts and suggestions of leaves. Medium sweet flavor with simple, bready malts, mild creamy toffee, faint cocoa. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Sweet finish with more bready malts, some caramel, ripe fruits. Quite tasty.
Barrington Scottish Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Pours brown with a thin white head. Smells sweet and fruity. Tastes caramelly with some brown sugar and hints of figs. Decent.
Barrington Scottish Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Very nice malty aroma. Fairly plain bottle and label. Brown beer. A little starchy, some toasted cereal, fruity, more of a brown ale. Very faint peat, light vanilla vapors. Mouthfeel is pithy. Finish is grain bitter. Thanks to DW.
Barrington Scottish Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Bottle: Good nose - carmel, dried fruit, sour dough. Clear copper color, no head. Sweet and bitter flavors. Fruity, grape, apple, cherry, carmel. Smooth and sticky. Tasty brew, though I'm not a fan of this style, very drinkable. Ok overall
Barrington Scottish Ale;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;"Extremely pale, almost yellow; weak earthy-floral nose, really wondered if I got the wrong thing here. No, there's enough earthiness to qualify as a Scottish, but the malt is very subdued, it is quite hoppy at the end..just unbalanced and weird."
Southampton European Pilsener;Southampton, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Southampton Publick House;"Pours the color of freshly mown straw; the head is white, fluffy and resilient. Aroma is of lightly roasted malt, floral hop essence and hints of wild prairy grasses. Light butter notes, along with sourdough toast are understated, yet present. Pretty big mouthfeel for a pilsner, and yet incredibly smooth and creamy. A full flavored, refreshing pilsner, with good sweet malt front and balanced hop on the back. Somewhat grainy, citrus essence combines with a grassy, roasty flavor. All subtle. This pilsner kicks ass. I think I can say, and I don't often say this about any beer. but this is the finest pilsner I have ever imbibed. Cheers to Phil Markowski for winning me over again."
Southampton European Pilsener;Southampton, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Southampton Publick House;Straightforward, well-done yellow beer. Decent hop zing that hangs around a while. Goes a little acidic as it warms.
Southampton European Pilsener;Southampton, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Southampton Publick House;"Light golden, little head; sweetish, slightly woody, very fresh, strong earthy hoppiness throughout; aroma too light for this to be really memorable, but I'm glad I had it."
Original Saratoga Springs Pilsener;Saratoga Springs, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Original Saratoga Springs Brewpub;Pours with a golden body topped by a medium thick white lasting head with good lacing. Slightly sweet yet bitter grassy hop aroma with a good malt balance. Slightly bitter hop flavor with some piney, grassy notes and a touch of saltiness and sweet. Light bodied and slightly dry.
Original Saratoga Springs Pilsener;Saratoga Springs, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Original Saratoga Springs Brewpub;WARNING. Should you choose to follow this and the four reviews that follow, you will be put to sleep by the sheer boredom and dullness evidenced in this totally derivative sports-bar-ish trustafarian-seeking brewpub's products. There will be nothing even remotely of interest discussed in these reviews, unless I decided to go off on a major tangent about some girl, or some band or movie, or goddamn GWB or the just-as-stupid-if-slightly-less-venal pack of Democrats chasing his sorry ass around. BUT if I stick to the beer, you'll get something like this: pissy yellow, fruity but low-key nose, soft sweet tonguefeel, bitter dry finish without much real hop character on to the next winner.
Kasparus Swarte Bessie;Nagele, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;An unclear amber beer with a small white head. The aroma is sweet malty with strong notes of berries - which matches the flavor pretty much.
Kasparus Swarte Bessie;Nagele, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;(Bottle 33 cl) Clear, pretty amber colour with a fine, creamy head that leaves a fine lacework. Lovely berry-aromas. Lightly sweet berry-flavours with a dry finish. Soft and very pleasant fruit beer. 280705

Kasparus Swarte Bessie;Nagele, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;"Beautiful deep pink-orange, clear; pinkish foam, slowly disappearing despite lively bubbling. Nose definitely blackcurrant (=zwarte bessen), as well as a spicy touch. Soft sweet, with sourish, very fruity surrounding. Fine fruity flavours of cassis, raspberry and citrus (lemon). Spicy finish (nutmeg, Laos-root). Light, but very refreshing, dry finish, with long fruity aftertaste. Bravo - after a few very bad cases, a proof that an extra-small brewery, originating in homebrewery, can make something very wort(h)wile. I want more of them!"
Kasparus Swarte Bessie;Nagele, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;Bottled 20.09.01: beer gushes out of the bottle. Dark red color with a small head. Blackcurrant all over, earthy and dusty aroma and flavor. Slight sourness. Thin and fairly bitter. The yeastiness dominates the beer and spoils the flavor.
Kasparus van Oranje;Nagele, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;Bottled 750ml (BB 03/2013) Thanks bierkoning! Murky pinky color, small pinky head. Strawberry and cherry aroma, some tartness. Medium-bodied. Berryish, strawberry, cherry flavor. Light sourness, some sweetness. Very homebrewish fruit beer.

Kasparus van Oranje;Nagele, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;Like most of their beers this one smelled a bit like Chinese food (ginger i guess). Pretty average score.
Kasparus van Oranje;Nagele, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;A hazy orange beer with a white head. The aroma is light, but what is there is sweet and primarily yeasty. The flavor is malty with notes of oranges, leading to a dry end.

Kasparus van Oranje;Nagele, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;(Bottle 33 cl) Pilsener golden with a white, creamy head. Somewhat sweet, citrusy aromas. Rather light body with a soft, light citrusy sweetness - oranges. But this contains no less than 6 additives (E-numbers)! 280705

Kasparus van Oranje;Nagele, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;"Bottled March 03. Wheat beer packed with adjuncts. This beer contains E422 (used as anti-freeze for cars, but can also give body to beer), E110 & E124 (colourings that cause a wide variety of reactions including vomiting and hyperactivity), Sodium Benzoate (which is used both as a preservative and to disguise the taste of poor quality food) and citric acid from low grade lemons. I drank mine chilled - I would hate to experiment and try this warmed up. Anyway - it tastes artificial and chemical and just plain nasty. I personally don�t mind if a brewer plays around to create a fun drink with additives, but this one is simply not to my taste. There is little fun here, just a bitter flavour that could be spices, old hops, or any of the E numbers tipped in by the mad scientists who concocted this. The nearest flavour I could relate to is one of those ice pops that as I kid I used to buy - they came in long plastic condoms and were packed with preservatives and articicial flavourings - hey, just like this little sucker! Seriously - save your palate and your body, avoid this. It�s a drain pour - and Joris has just gone down in my estimation by giving this garbage a 3.1 and saying ""It isn�t really bad."""
Kasparus van Oranje;Nagele, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;"Gold-orange, very slight haze; slim snow-white head, good carbonation. Preserved sugared orange, much coriander, very slight sulphur in the nose. Taste yields coriander, tons of it. And a flavour that reminds me (sorry) of ""Lumpfish eggs"" (fake caviar). I wonder if it's colouring agent - there's a list of 6 E-numbered additions on the label (NOT for German export, this). There's a touch of acidity like in a wheatbeer - or are the coriander & orange deceiving me? It has a rather fresh mouthfeel - surprising with all the coriander. What IS the idea here? One-off for a Dutch royal wedding - the orange label for every orange-mad Dutchman, taste or not? It says ""type:orange beer"" ont the label. Type??? It isn't really bad, but it doesn't exactly inspire confiance."
Kasparus Witje;Nagele, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;From bottle at Bier Xperience Steenwijk 2016. Aroma is sweetish malt, apples, some notes of grapes. Flavour is moderate sweet. Body is medium. How is this a Wibier? Drinkable, but very dull and unfresh.
Kasparus Witje;Nagele, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;Bottled 20.09.02. A bit darker as an average witbier. Cloudy with a small persisting head. Yeasty aroma, with a touch of grapes. Creamy, yeasty, slightly fruity flavor. Very light and inoffensive aroma and flavor, but also lacks character. Refreshing beer, though.
Kasparus Schokkers Lust;Nagele, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;I poured this beer looked at the colour, and while i was judging the colour i smelled something weird. Took a good sniff and i smelled Chinese food. That�s the best way i can describe it. Probably ginger-like. Also noticable in the taste. I like Chinese food, i like beer, but i don�t like Chinese food in my beer.
Kasparus Schokkers Lust;Nagele, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;Again that weird, unfresh smell. According to other raters it�s probably ginger. But anyway this beer is just off. Totally unbalanced, just weird.

Avery Anniversary Ten;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Clean orange pour with no head. Aroma is orange marmalade, vanilla, golden raisins and grain. Flavor is sweet malt complexity with light orange notes, some zest. Light bitterness with some alcohol spice balances the sweet malts. very round and full flavored. Enamel ripper but not in a bad way. It has this soft and dry character with a mix of bitterness that clings to the decaying malt sweetness to balance pretty well. This smells intense and a bit winey but really comes together in the flavor. Ends a bit too dry and causes the finish to be chalky.
Avery Anniversary Ten;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bottle sample. Pours opaque orange with a medium beige head. Fruity aroma of raisin and strawberry with a bit of funk and cereal malt. Creamy and grainy malt flavor with a bit of fruit.

The aroma is rich chewy aged malt sweetness, solid pine hop notes and a thick layer of yum. The taste is the same with rich smooth sweet chewy malts and pine hops. It runs smoothly into the finish with thick malts, muted pine hops and caramel. This has held up perfectly. I could drink plenty more of this.
Avery Anniversary Ten;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);bottle shared by Ibrew2or3. Pours a deep orange.

Surprisingly, the beer had retained plenty of carbonation and some light head retention. aroma and taste, lots of caramel, grainy mouthfeel. some chocolate also noticeable, finish keeps some light hops and overall a big caramel, fruity profile with some warming abv. Hops seemed a little more attenuated, nevertheless, a fine complex beer.
Avery Anniversary Ten;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Vintage 6 years. Pours semi-clear dark amber color almost burn orange. There is a large off white that quickly disappears. Immediate strong aroma of hay and orange. The first thing I notice is how smooth this beer is for how big it is. Very complex things going on in it, not sure if I like some of them but some are very good. I get a feel for the once astringent hop bite that has now mellowed to a quarter of its old self. The malts are quite nice and some fruity esters and a good amount of sweetness. Overall it seems this beer has become more complex but lost some of the punch I like in beer.
Avery Anniversary Ten;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Poured amber with white head. Past it�s prime. Some fruit and sweet malt malt but mostly booze. Still drinkable.

Brewer's Alley New Moon Ale;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery;Served cask at the brewpub... very nice beer. Strong aroma, solid hops. 7.2% so served in the fluted glass vs. a pint... marginal decision to do this, but that�s okay. Good temp... not cold, but room temp. Very cloudy, foamy head that lasts, but doesn�t hold in aroma. Very nice Ale, strong but balanced. A Keeper.
Greenwich Harvest Berry Ale;New York, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Greenwich Brewing Co.;Sampled at the New York brewpub 16th Dec 2005, is this the one with blueberries in? if it is then this is the one that I had. Refreshing beer that tastes fine but is hardly exciting.

Greenwich Harvest Berry Ale;New York, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Greenwich Brewing Co.;purple and very soda-like. as with the other greenwich beers i thought this tasted a bit stale. very generic berry taste
Greenwich Harvest Berry Ale;New York, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Greenwich Brewing Co.;I'm such a sucker for a fruit beer. A bit heavily carbonated, but otherwise a basic brewpub fruit beer nicely done.
Three Needs Grand Cru;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Always excited to see any beer that's labeled ""Grand Cru""; some of my favorite beers bear this august appelation (Allagash, Rodenbach, Southampton). Alas, this will not be an addition to the pantheon. Muddy/dirty light brown/orange color, virtually no head (on tap). Slight spiciness in the nose, yeasty, and a bit of apricot/banana. Very sweet & fruity (bananas in syrup), a little weak overall flavor-wise. Just not a lot of character. I'm certain the beer would be helped out by not being served in PINT glasses at REFRIGERATOR temperatures! Idiots."
Upland Chocolate Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upland Brewing Company;Opaque dark brown with a quickly dissolving thin tan head. Aroma of chocolate, roasted malt, oatmeal, mild coffee and a kiss of the hops. Taste of chocolate, oatmeal, dark chocolate, roasted malt and light coffee. Creamy texture and some chocolate bitterness on the back end. Overall I was impressed and will seek this one out again.
Upland Chocolate Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upland Brewing Company;Dark brown pour with a thick, but fast-fading tan head. The nose is quite chocolatey. Nice sweet milk-chocolately initially with a little bit of light earthy undertones. The palate is quite nice. It has a slightly silky feel without being overly rich. A bit of herbal earthiness toward the back. It�s pretty simple, but it works for what it is.
Upland Chocolate Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upland Brewing Company;Bottle. Darkest brown pour with a medium tan head. Malty aroma with lots of chocolate. Malty flavor up front with a bit of alcohol, some chocolate and a semi-roasty finish.
Upland Chocolate Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upland Brewing Company;This Stout pours black with brown around the edges and has a medium tan head that recedes quickly. Small patches of lacing on the glass. Chocolate malt aroma with hints of burnt coffee. Medium, dry body with flavors of malt and dark chocolate plus hints of coffee and oatmeal. The finish is roasty with a dark chocolate aftertaste. Above average overall.
Upland Chocolate Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upland Brewing Company;Her pour is clean and not very thick. Dark brown with black highlights, light peaks through rather easily while a small head is reduced to a spattering of bubbles. Coasting on up to my nose are sweet and bitter chocolate esters followed by caf� latte cream and fresh espresso. Her chocolate is enjoyably prominent, though I detect none of the standard American milk chocolate notes. Instead, I smell richer, harder, bitterer Belgian or Swiss chocolate notes which could be attributed to the chocolate being organic and not a product of mass production. Will her palate hold up to her nose? My first quaff is unexpectedly rather thin and very clean. Crunchy dark chocolates are backed up by espresso in the finish. A faint citric bite tingles on top of my tongue while an overall dry, roasted presence clears the moisture from my palate. The thin body is a bit of a distraction from her continuous chocolate parade, but overall she is highly enjoyable. Near the end, crunchy chocolate covered espresso beans join the mix, while more citric esters clean my palate for my final few quaffs. Overall, I rather enjoyed the Upland Chocolate Stout. Her only downfall would be the unusually thin body. As a chocolate stout, I expect more depth and weight to give her a full body to match her full palate. That aside, an excellent desert beer or after-dinner aperitif.
Upland Chocolate Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upland Brewing Company;12oz. bottle thanks to 17thfloor. Opaque black with frothy, burnt brown head. Aroma is roast, heavy chocolate, some smoke and coffee. Flavor is chocolate, roast, slight cold coffee, smoke, some bakers chocolate, medium sweet, tasty but sweet and weird alc finish as it warms.

Upland Chocolate Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upland Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Pours a very dark glassy brown with a large foamy tan froth. Strong gritty roasted malt aroma, dark chocolate pieces, some coffee, quite nice. Really strange flavor, very different, dry coffee beans, espresso for sure, gritty dark chocolate, moderate acidity, nice bitterness, the sweetness is actually kind of off-putting, would be much better as a dry stout, lovely depth. Interesting palate, creamy but thin, crunchy carbonation.

Upland Chocolate Stout;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Upland Brewing Company;Bottle... Pours black with a small, creamy, beige head. Decent retention.

Bitter dark chocolate and espresso grounds flavor. Lengthy, acrid, bitter finish. Kudos to StFun for providing the bottle!

Southampton Golden Valley Trappist Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Southampton Publick House;Pours a mild cloudy golden with a thick lacy white head. Aroma is loaded with dry Belgian malts. Dry, semi-sweet body has a powerful lingering floral hop quality, but could use more Belgian malty balance. An interesting style to say the least and fairly well done, but I�m not sure if it couldn�t use some tweaking.
Southampton Golden Valley Trappist Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Southampton Publick House;Bold horseblanket aroma, with a layer of sour on top. Flavor strikes hard with some sour lambic and some biting witbier characteristics. The finish is amazingly crisp, dry and short (just like Orval). This is an excellent (albeit rare) potable.
Southampton Golden Valley Trappist Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Southampton Publick House;gabf'03 Cloudy pour with spicy aroma. An evolving, tannin taste that is sour and woody. Evolves and finishes better when it warms.

Southampton Golden Valley Trappist Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Southampton Publick House;GABF '03 Excellent beer overall.It did lack head retention,but it fruity and malty in the nose.Mouthfeel was very smooth and silky,finishing dry in flavor.
Southampton Golden Valley Trappist Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Southampton Publick House;Pale cloudy orange. Little head, not stable. Very fruity nose, citrus, passionfruit, obviously very fruity yeast - a tad too exotic for a Belgian trappist... Taste is meaty, fruity, yeasty. A bit phenolic. Mouthfeel - its strength. Very dry, giving a perfect counterbalance for the fruitiness of the flavour. I pick up very little Brett, if any at all. Yet it is used. If Orval is the target - long way to go still. Problem is Orval is a very mixed batch of yeaststrains. This beer is complex, but not yet in the Orval way.
Southampton Golden Valley Trappist Pale Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Southampton Publick House;This beer rocks! Cloudy, golden ale with a large, rocky, off-white head. The nose is fruity and tart. Spicy and earthy. Very complex and Geueze-like. Citrus fruit, yeast, banana, green apple and oak. Just an awesome aroma! Nicely balanced and full of flavors. Very yeasty with citrus undertones. Medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Short, desert-dry finish. Damn fine beer!

Craftsman Rye Pale Ale;Pasadena, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Craftsman Brewing Company;Definitely not the most exciting beer Ive ever sampled at a fest or from Craftsman. To be honest, this one disappointed me. It poured an amber color with a thin sheet of pearlish head. The aroma was full of rye, bread, hops, citrusy orange, and something of a stir fry smell..very funky and hard to describe. The taste was super peppery, and I didnt dig that all too much. Very spicy and dry with bready qualities and souring citrus. Some peaches, salts and grapefruit skins in the aftertaste. This has so much going on, that the combination of tastes made this a disaster in the finish. I didnt understand this beer at all...not very impressive.
Craftsman Rye Pale Ale;Pasadena, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Craftsman Brewing Company;Sampled @ Pizza Port Real Ale Festival 2003.Beautiful copper brew with a full head that sticks around till the end of the glass.

Craftsman Rye Pale Ale;Pasadena, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Craftsman Brewing Company;A very simple amberish brew with a small head on it. Nice floral aroma with some sugarishness to it, actually this tastes like a combination of a glazed jelly donut and tapioca pudding.

Pizza Port Red Square Imperial Stout;Carlsbad, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Pretty solid. Reminded me of Santa�s Little Helper. Coffee and chocolate notes in a medium body. Just a little unbalanced. Pretty sweet without a lot of hop balance.
Pizza Port Red Square Imperial Stout;Carlsbad, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);[At GABF 2004] A pitch black beer with a small ligth brown head. The aroma is sweet malty and slightly nutty. The flavor is sweet roasted with notes of chocolate and coffee. Great, but I�d like more complexity in the aroma.
Pizza Port Red Square Imperial Stout;Carlsbad, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Oil can black with an everlasting cream tan head. Major lacing. Aroma of must, raisen, dark chocolate, roasted beans and some ABV. The palate is creamy delicious. The body is well rounded and extremely smooth. One of the best Impy�s I�ve had.
Pizza Port Red Square Imperial Stout;Carlsbad, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);On tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad. This is an excellent Imperial Stout. Pitch black like an Imp should be, moderate brown head. Aroma/flavor is rich,sweet, and slight burnt. Flavors of prune, molasses, coffee and chocolate come to mind - especially chocolate.

Pizza Port Red Square Imperial Stout;Carlsbad, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Bottle courtesy of TAR. Black color with no head. A little barley in the aroma. Some chocolate and coffee flavors, but watery overall.
Pizza Port Red Square Imperial Stout;Carlsbad, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);On tap at Pizza Port in carlsbad. Appearance is what you�d expect and the aroma is about the same, malty with a hint of chocolate and coffee aromas. One person said that the overall aroma isn�t as pronouced as it should be, and I agree with that. The flavor is a bit lacking, not much but a little. It�s mostly a malty flavor. It�s not bad, but I feel that this could be a better beer if there was a little more intensity in the flavor. Overall a good beer, but could use a little more.
Pizza Port Red Square Imperial Stout;Carlsbad, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Bottled from growler from TAR: Poured pitch black with a slight wisp of a head. Aroma is mostly of cherries, slightly sour milk. Cherries took over midway through. Full bodied mouthfeel. Taste is cherry, roasted malt, with a hint of coffee. Good.
Pizza Port Red Square Imperial Stout;Carlsbad, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);GABF 2004: Opaque blackness with a dense dark tan head. Aroma is roasty sweet and chocolatey, but didn�t seem to be as pronounced as most imperial�s aromas. Rich, roasty and sweet caramel malty flavor that is somewhat cloying and doesn�t hide the alcohol as well as it could. Finishes with some dark chocolate and roasted coffee beans. A nice imperial that could just use a little touching up.
Pizza Port Red Square Imperial Stout;Carlsbad, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Draught at Pizza Port (Carlsbad), California. Pitch black beer with a fine tan head. Sweet aroma with a nice roasted malt tone. Fruit also. Nice but rather mild. Full and heavy flavor. Dark roasted malt, chocolate and hops in the background. Some alcohol in the finish. An excellent stout enjoyed at a cool bar!
Seabright Castle Beach ESB;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Seabright Brewery;Tap @ brewpub. Golden orange color. Minimal flavors, smooth, slightly dry. So boring that it hurt. Do you ever feel guilty when you smile at the bartender and tell them you are enjoying the sampler when you wish they had something better to offer.
Seabright Castle Beach ESB;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Seabright Brewery;A nice sherbert orange color to it with medium head. Boring aroma of basically nothing more than the air around it. Some hops and some faint malts that are so faint that you can barely tell just what the hell they are, but they seem to be like 7 grain bread. Boring beer.
Seabright Castle Beach ESB;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Seabright Brewery;(cask) Amber color with a nice head..spicy hop aroma hints of must and brown sugar..soft floral flavors touch at caramel and peanut skins..
Oggis Belgian Pale;San Clemente, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;Sampled Pizza Port Real Ale Festival 2003. Pours a pale gold brew with a big densely packed white head. Yeasty, biscuity, orange peel nose. Had the first pour of this one and it was very bitter. Re-sampled later that night and found it much more enjoyable with hints of clove and coriander.
Oggis Belgian Pale;San Clemente, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;A bright glass of sunshine with a strong cherryish aroma that also sporting some yeast. Tastes like soap, rubber and yeast

Russell Lemon Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Russell Brewing Company;I am so hooked on this beer. My husband likes it too. Please do not discontinue.
Russell Lemon Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Russell Brewing Company;Very light color. Nice lemon taste, but unfortunatelly very watery, too. Not necessarily recommend.
Russell Lemon Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Russell Brewing Company;pours watery light yellow, smallish quickly dissipating head, some lacing. 1st sip in an ice chilled glass, very crisp (due to the temp). 4th sip after 3 minutes, tastes a bit metallic (copper), minor grains (wheat, bread) and a very very faint lemony aroma with a bit of sour citrus. Light-bodied, low complexity, low depth. Too plain, too boring.
Russell Lemon Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Russell Brewing Company;Lemon is strong in the floral and lightly grainy aroma. Brilliantly clear golden body is topped by a thin white head that lasts wetland laces nicely. Refreshing lemon blends well with biscuity cereal malt character and moderate crisp bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. Light body with pleasant strong carbonation. Sampled on tap at the Black Frog in Gastown.
Russell Lemon Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Russell Brewing Company;Lemon coloured, lemon aroma, lemon taste... who knew? Too malty with the lemon flavour, kind of an odd taste, methinks this would work better as a lager.
Russell Lemon Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Russell Brewing Company;GCBF 2010. Pale yellow gold. No mistaking the lemon aroma and flavour here! Very lemony! Missing the tartness I had expected, and came off as artificial. Not my thing.
Russell Lemon Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Russell Brewing Company;"Draught at Amberjack Tap House, Surrey, BC Blond color; creamy head. Surprisingly... Lemon aroma. Dry Lager, poor flavor, with a disturbing lemon presence. Strong bitterness. Bah."
Russell Lemon Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Russell Brewing Company;Can shared with mabel & jerc. Clear yellow-gold with a small white head. Strong artificial lemon aroma, with dirty yeast notes in the background. Thin bodied. Flavour has a lot of lemon, much less artificial than the aroma suggests (yeah, I thought just the opposite of jerc...). Not amazing, but relatively refreshing.
Russell Lemon Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Russell Brewing Company;[1782-20081015] 355 can. Artificial lemon-lime aroma has a hint of lemon Pledge cleaner fluid. Clear, yellow orange body with quick white bubbles. Flavour is lemon slices and a little yeast. Light body has some bubbles and acidity. Interesting to try but not in a repeatable way. <br /><i>(c/o GregClow, w/ him, jerc)</i>
Russell Lemon Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Russell Brewing Company;2008-10-15. Golden body with a small white ehad. Big lemony aroma, lemon juice notes. (6+) Flavour is very lemony, but seems a touch more artificial than did the aroma, not much of a base beer. (6+) Average to light body. Actually not bad, shandy like, but has not much depth to it. Could see this being a summery cocktail?
Storm Precipitation Pilsener;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Storm Brewing (BC);NIce foam and off-yellow body, aroma of some unique grains it seems. Flavour is a nice mix of grain and a bit of citrus, unique and well balanced. A very good drinker.
Storm Precipitation Pilsener;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Storm Brewing (BC);At the source: super mild golden pilsner. Super mellow bready lager. Low hoppage.
Storm Precipitation Pilsener;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Storm Brewing (BC);Very lush and creamy white head. Almost floral aroma. Crisp texture. Solid.

Storm Precipitation Pilsener;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Storm Brewing (BC);Draft - Nice sweet citrus and peel. Clear pale gold with a rich white head. Lots of leafy notes and leafy bitterness.. Earlier Rating: 11/1/2013 Total Score: 3 Draft - Sour lemon and white grape. Pale yellow and fizzy with a decent white head. Grains and white grape, slight bitterness and clean finish.
Storm Precipitation Pilsener;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Storm Brewing (BC);On June 21, 2015. At Storm Brewing, in Vancouver, British Columbia. Hazy golden color, white head. Sweet, light banana scent. Malty, cream taste. Bitter aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, medium bitterness.
Storm Precipitation Pilsener;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Storm Brewing (BC);Sampled on tap at Storm, pours a clear pale golden with a small white head. Nose is fairly light, with notes of grass and crackery malt. Flavour brings out grassiness and some crispness. Thirst-quenching pils that is well-balanced. Very nice.
Empire Abbey Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Empire Brewing Company;Nice deep brown hue and the aroma was like smelling rum nut iced cream. Had some carbonation problems and the alcohol kept butting into the flavor as it warmed. Better served cold where you can pick out a nice raisin/plum taste and an even malt finish.
Empire Dortmunder Export;Syracuse, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Empire Brewing Company;Another strong example of Empires committment to producing fresh, well imitated German Beers. Pale Orangish yellow, with a grainy/malt aroma. This one opens up with a dry, sour malty taste that prepares you for the full body. When I say sour, I dont mean it in a bad way. This beer is excellent. Could stand some more hop flavor in the body, but I think I say that about all German Beers. This beer ends with a very meaty, warm alcohol flavor and leaves a sharp, tangy taste in your mouth. Has a few problems with carbonation but evens out as it warms. Overall the beer is very flavorful and a very unique beer.
Empire Municher Helles;Syracuse, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Empire Brewing Company;From 2002: I drank this beer quite a lot over that summer. At first I didn�t appreciate this beer (certainly not knowing as much about beer as I do now), but I came to really enjoy it. Pours a golden yellow, with a small head. Has some earthy notes, plant/leaf maybe, and a bit of floral taste. Light body, easy on the palate and easy to drink.
Empire Municher Helles;Syracuse, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Empire Brewing Company;Yellow-gold with some tinges of orange/copper. Fairly pungent aroma, with some grassy, sharp tones. Somewhat lighter in body than the Dortmunder, with more of an earthy/grassy appeal, maybe some hints of a light floral-lemon appeal. The body is medium to light and the beer is not too carbonated and quite even. A good rendition, but I prefer more malt.
Empire Instigator Doppelbock;Syracuse, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Empire Brewing Company;A dark clear brown ale with a thin lacing moka head. A sweet lightly molassey bock with fruity bananas, and treacle. In mouth, a nice chocolaty banana, cloves and a bit of oranges. Very nice. On tap at brewpub, August 15 2008.
Empire Instigator Doppelbock;Syracuse, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Empire Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewpub. AU15/08. App.: Deep ruby, remnants of a tan head. Aroma: Really vinous, tangy and woody, sour cherries and other sour fruits, currants, alcohol, quite assertive. Palate: Medium+ body and very soft carbonation. Flav.: More towards caramel and toffee, less vinous, a trace buttery, brown sugar and molasses blueberries and black currants. A fairly big beer.
Empire Instigator Doppelbock;Syracuse, New York, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Empire Brewing Company;A mix between orange gold and brown, with even some red flecks. Moderately small white head. Has a fresh almost citrusy smell. Empire�s classic example, called the Instigator. Smooth and tending towards a lighter malt taste up front, with some hops character. Grows sweeter and blossoms into a medium/full body with hints of what I would call a sweet orange flavor. Finishes with that traditional german yeasty/malt taste that is a little bit too sugary in my opinion. This one was lighter overall and less a challenge to drink than other dopplebocks. Prone to being a bit lacking of flavor overall. I liked the lighter take on a dopplebock, not really caring much for them, but a true dopplebock fan probably wouldnt.
Empire Smoked Porter;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Empire Brewing Company;Nov 2000 - the one we had was labeled Rauchbier, I assume this is the same. Nobody in my group but Matt liked this one. It It's very strongly, and artificially, smokey... if you like that. The guy said it used liquid smoke added to it rather than smoked malt. That may have changed since then.
Empire Smoked Porter;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Empire Brewing Company;December 2002 release. Smells like hops and burnt malt. Burnt gray/brownish appearance, with some deep tan tinges. Small dissipating head. Began very bitter but then blossomed into a sweeter caramel malt. Smokey flavor was present initially and at the finish. Had only a medium body and was a bit too fizzy for my taste, but the body was complex and certainly provided the smoked barley malt I was looking for. The great thing was that it did not overpower with smoked flavor. The brewer had some extra smoked malt lying around and on a whim decided to make this. A great beer.
Martin's Blond Ale;Genval, Belgium;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;John Martin;Session beer made at Palm, but I�m not sure it is still produced now. Warm golden blonde colour and light fruitiness, malt sweetishness, bit metallic, thinnish mouthfeel, insufficient hops in the finish. Rather bland actually, I had many better golden ales from the Anglo-Saxon world, where they were invented. Forgettable.

Belle-Vue S�lection Lambic;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Belle-Vue (AB InBev);750 ml bottle. Vintage: 1999. Thank you Adamchandler on this share. Flavor has sour grain, lemon juice, mild vinegar, oak. Maybe tart berries and a mild vinaigrette finish. The carbonation is flat.

Belle-Vue S�lection Lambic;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Belle-Vue (AB InBev);Bottle, courtesy of Mats, thanks! Vintage 1999. Pours unclear amber. Aroma is pure horse blanket, hay, soft berries, oxidized but not too much. Body is medium, strongly sour but not tart, low carbonation but not lacking. Complex, but not overdone, maybe a tad too old. Not dead, though. Good!
Belle-Vue S�lection Lambic;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Belle-Vue (AB InBev);1999 bottle, many thanks Mats! Clear deep orange color with no head. Aroma is berries, vineous, parmeggiano, horseblanket. Taste is horseblanket, a bit of everything, vinegary, but not too much yet. Oily mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Held up well!
Belle-Vue S�lection Lambic;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Belle-Vue (AB InBev);(750ml 1999 bottle from Mikkeller Webshop) Pours a clear bright copper with a tiny white head that fades without lace. Aroma is quite tart, lactic acid, crabapple, musty basement, old wood, oxidized slightly nutty sherry notes, slightly spicy hops, citrus, light acetic notes. Flavour is quite sour, fruity notes of lemon, gooseberry, tart red berries, fruit vinegar, unripe pit fruit, sharp lactic acid, wet wood, Brett horseblanket. Finish dries lightly with wood and some oxidation but generally persists as very sour, lactic and acetic long into the aftertaste. Medium bodied with quite low carbonation remaining. Interesting and a bit challenging as this is clearly on the decline but still has some redeeming qualities. I suspect this was always on the sour side (a bit Hanssens-like?) but age and a little oxidation has thrown the balance off. That being said, it also still tastes good beyond the bracing nature. Very fun to try.
Burg De Tweede Vergissing;Ermelo, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Burg Bieren;Dark brown color, small head. Aroma of roasted malts. Bit yeasty taste and malty. Not as sour as the Burg Dubbel, and that's exactly why this beer is more like a belgian double. I thought it was quite nice, one of the better Burg brews actually.
Burg De Tweede Vergissing;Ermelo, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Burg Bieren;Strong coffee and milk chocolate aroma, like Wiener Melange. Also Wiener Melange flavor. Yeasty, very thin and water. Far from perfect beer, but drinkable.

Borsodi P�l�;B�cs, Hungary;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Borsodi S�rgy�r (Molson Coors);"Smells of that typical low-alc mixture of lemon and bread; looks like lemon water, too, though lemonade is probably more attractive. Taste is bitter and sour corn, like fermented vegetables, without the alcohol. It would be a good drink to offer to kids to put them off drinking beer. All in all, another worthless non-alcohol."

Kind Beers Ale;Charlotte, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kind Beers;12oz bottle, generic looking label with the small tip of a pointed leaf as the on eye catcher. Pours hazy pale color. Aroma of grassy hops, some grapefruit. Flavor of some pale malts, very bitter. Overly hopped. Too much bitterness compared to the watery malt presence. Not my bag.
Kind Beers Ale;Charlotte, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kind Beers;Frothy white head, orange hazy color. Hoppy aroma--soap and grapefruit like. Interesting change from the standard APA with overdone Cascade. Flavor is hop crazy. Only complaint is that the incredible hop blending is wasted on a lighter malt presence. The same hops would be better in a beer that has a bit more alcohol--Imperial IPA or IPA.
Kind Beers Ale;Charlotte, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kind Beers;Mmmm.... A flavorful and refreshing pale ale fron NC. Has a nice and spicy body with lemon and orange notes. A bit simple, but good.

Free State Batch 2000;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Free State Brewing Company;Draft: Charred caramel. Minimal ashen ring of foam. Rich malt nose with notes of cinnamon bread, prune, caramel, baker�s chocolate, fig, and walnut. Northern Brewer battles the Fuggles for supremacy, and easily wins. Hints of black cherries and rumlike alcohol. Extremely mellow, full-bodied, and quite silky. Tangy hop notes with flashes of coffee, dried plum, dark grape, metal, and brown sugar. Big Fuggle earthiness and leafiness to follow. Long raisiny, toffeeish finish. Nothing short of stunning.

Bagel Beer Blueberry Ale;Gilroy, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coast Range Brewing Company;Last remnant of the BIF 13 from hell package from BeerAdvocate drewbage, this one was a 22 oz. bomber promising extra pain. Blueberry Bagels are not my favorite anyway, and making a beer with that flavor seems like a particularly horrid idea. When poured into a pint glass, this one looked average, with a pale macro yellow color and fizzy carbonation feeding a foamy small head. Lacing was much better than macro swill. The aroma was totally nonexistent. No hops, malt, blueberries, nothing at all. Only smell was a bit of grainy alcohol and water. The taste was not objectionable, but that�s about it. It had a macro like sweetness with a hint of blueberries. The beer felt thin and unsubstantial on the palette. I understand the need for micro brewer�s to experiment a bit, but making a Bagel Beer line was not a good idea. No wonder they closed down.
Bagel Beer Blueberry Ale;Gilroy, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coast Range Brewing Company;Brewtopia�04. Figured I�d go ahead and sample their beer since they were good enought to sponsor the tasting glasses - I�m usually not into gimicky such beers. Smelled and tasted bready and doughy, some blueberry. I guess they hit their mark, although it�s not a very appealing beer to me.
Bagel Beer Blueberry Ale;Gilroy, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coast Range Brewing Company;Tasted in NYC. Tasted at Brewtopia 04. Aroma is of bread and yeast. Very little blueberry present in the scent. Appearance is thin and clear with alight straw yellow colour with a small white head. Taste has a very strong bread flavour with an ending that is subtle blueberry.
Bagel Beer Blueberry Ale;Gilroy, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coast Range Brewing Company;Light gold, sticky white head. Nose is less than promising. Bit of blueberry, but has an unpleasant skunkiness, off and a bit sour. Starts sweet, then comes the blueberry. To steal a line from BierBauch's rating, it tastes quite a bit like a blueberry Pop Tart, definite fruit but tastes pretty artificial. Brewed with blueberry bagels, and I can't imagine who thought that sort of thing would be a good idea. Does improve somewhat as it warms, artificial sweetness fades away and develops at least a decent malty character.
Bagel Beer Blueberry Ale;Gilroy, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coast Range Brewing Company;A vigorous pour resulted in only a modest white head that shrank considerably in a short time. Color is a clear medium gold. The aroma was light at first but soon after it had warmed, I could begin to smell the blueberry in what otherwise seemed like a pale ale to me. Funny, I kept smelling the blueberry as if it had some rosemary in there too. Weird. The blueberry was actually a bit like the aroma of a blueberry poptart also. Anyway, the texture of this beer was almost like a cream ale. Quite smooth and creamy. The overall flavor was interesting yet kind of uneventful. Like a pale ale with the blueberry in the background somewhere. I really like the Pumpernickel Porter from this brewery, but this one misses the mark a bit. Not a bad ale, just not a great one.
Bagel Beer Blueberry Ale;Gilroy, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coast Range Brewing Company;Wow!This was a good brew.Poured a golden color and was very fruity on the nose.Had a strong blueberry taste with very little after taste.The finish was clean.I reccomend this to others.
Bagel Beer Blueberry Ale;Gilroy, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coast Range Brewing Company;"Sort of a gassy, wort-like aroma - bit of a fruity undertone to it though - not unpleasant. Little to no head - light golden, cloudy appearance. Sweet, somewhat artificial flavor - not a bad mouthfeel though - slightly velvety. Would be very refeshing outdoors on a hot day. Stays strong throughout the whole 22 oz bottle. Not a bad effort for a novelty beer - 3rd of the ""Bagel"" beers that I have had and all in all they are not bad."
Bagel Beer Blueberry Ale;Gilroy, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coast Range Brewing Company;Kind of stinky Kolsch aroma. Lame label. The flavor is segmented: sugary sweet, then a little tart followed by the fruity flavor. The blueberry isn't easily identifiable, as with Sweetwater Blue (which if you're looking for a blueberry beer, and you have a choice, that's the one to get...) Golden beer. The palate is starchy and sweet, like froot loops milk sorta. The finish is short and sweet. A novelty beer, certainly not worth the $4 that I paid for a bomber.

Durham Graduation;Bowburn, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Durham Brewery;Light yellow color, hazy when you pour the generous yeast from the bottle, little carbonation in body but a big fluffy, white head. Hoppy, floral, if a bit one-dimensional aroma. Very very dry, bit of an astringent, metallic edge that fades a bit, leaving wheat but a longing for something other than bitterness.
Durham Graduation;Bowburn, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Durham Brewery;Bottle conditioned. Hazy thin amber. Tendrils of orange vines shoot up the nose, nestling warm and spicy under the eyes, pulsating like an Alien larva ready to feed. Soft, juicy and natural mouthfeel as the waters of Pishon and Gihon must have tasted. A hop, skip and dance of young, throbbingly naked yet obscenely chaste, citric sprites leads to an initially watery then briefly bitter finish. Spent on the early desire. [3.4] Re-rate. Bottle Conditioned, with Nuffield & Duff. Extremely dry. Citric hops and wheat in an English Pale style - a Golden Summer Ale. [3.2] The Durham Brewery was founded in 1994 by ex-music teachers Steve & Christine Gibbs.
Durham Graduation;Bowburn, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Durham Brewery;Bottle conditioned. Straw gold, good white head and moderate condition. Chunky thick dark yeast sediment. Hops mingled with fruity yeast in the nose, Grapefruit and yeast in the mouth along with a slight phenolic taint. Quite sweet in the finish but with a good hop bitterness.

Terken Septante 5 Blanche;Roubaix, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Terken (Grande Brasserie Moderne);(Bottle 75 cl) Hazy, pale yellowish with a rather small head. Heavily carbonated though. Belgian inspired spiciness, but it doesn�t really come out with much of a pow or refinement. Bit weak in the flavours actually with a surprise bitter finish.

The flavor is really-really-really sweet corn syrup and some grainy malt, dirty, with a bored alcohol hiccup at the end. The finish was sticky sweet, spoiled, and cried out for a good tooth-brushing and aniseptic mouthwash.
Gryb�w Rejent Mocny;Gryb�w, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Gryb�w (Browar Pilsweizer S.A.);"Gryb�w seems to have changed their label from Red to Gold to Green... possibly for the export version of this beer. I hope to have a new photo up soon. Hazy amber, sediment late, mostly flat, with a whitish head that fades to scum... then completely disappears. Cooked vegetable aroma with sweet pale malts and dog kibble beneath. Malted flavor is both sweet and sour with a hint of alcohol that dries but does not overwhelm. Not a drain pour, but definitely not worth the premium cost I paid for a 3 year old bottle (BB 10.01.2003). In retrospect I should have shared... didn�t realize it was so ""rare"". From a small liquor store in Burbank that carries a few micros and imports but isn�t worth adding to the RB database."
Gryb�w Rejent Mocny;Gryb�w, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Gryb�w (Browar Pilsweizer S.A.);Bottled. Pale amber. Neutral aroma. Full bodied with clean, firm maltiness and a grassy bitter finish. Well balanced.
Gryb�w Rejent Mocny;Gryb�w, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Gryb�w (Browar Pilsweizer S.A.);Best By 10.01.2003 Thick golden liquid with a small lid of small off white bubbles that diminishes into just a few ugly big bubbles. Heavy sweet (near sickening) malt aroma. Heavy malt sweetness with flavors of lemon grass and light corn syrup. Some floral hops flavors seem to add to the sweetness. Light syrupy finish. At least it was fresher sample.
Gryb�w Rejent Mocny;Gryb�w, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Gryb�w (Browar Pilsweizer S.A.);very smooth beer with a nice calming hint of lemon. very refeshing unlike some of the other polish beers out there i really enjoyed it

Spendrups Gammeldags Svagdricka;Gr�ngesberg, Sweden;Traditional Ale - Other;Spendrups Bryggeri;0,5 l bottle, not real beer in my mind, more similar to kvass which not for children :).
Spendrups Gammeldags Svagdricka;Gr�ngesberg, Sweden;Traditional Ale - Other;Spendrups Bryggeri;"17-09-2018; bottle; at home (bought somewhere in Sweden). The looks of the beer are nice. It looks a bit like a heavily foaming cola. The colour is reddish brown with a nice coppery glow. The beer is pretty clear and loads of gas bubbles can be seen rising towards the top. There they form that very thick layer of soft, frothy light brown foam, that seems to stay on top for quite some time. The beer is aromatically seen not to interesting. It is mainly malty. The malt aromas are sweet, a bit sticky, with a decent amount of toast. The toasted aromas give some chocolate touches and quite some caramel. The malts are a bit plain and bready in general though. Hops aren't really clearly present, neither are yeast aromas. There might be some earthy hops, but mainly it is just sweet malts. This is also the case with the flavour. Sweet, very sweet. Thera are some bitter flavours, mainly some toast and a minimal hoppy thing. But mainly it's an unbalanced sweetness. The palate of the beer is below average. It lacks carbonation, has a rather light body and feels quite thin and watery. The finish is mainly sweet watery malts, with a bitter touch in the finish. The beer lacks strength, body and power. It is more a sweet malt lemonade than a beer now."
Spendrups Gammeldags Svagdricka;Gr�ngesberg, Sweden;Traditional Ale - Other;Spendrups Bryggeri;Fles @ Idre Fj�ll, VIII 2018. Ziet er uit als cola, proeft een beetje als oud bruin van Heineken maar dan wel minder zoet. Weinig koolzuur die een minimaal schuimkraagje produceert. Hele lichte bitter, proef beetje de malt en klein zoetje maar niet zo zoet als van Heineken. De geur is beetje zoet en verbazingwekkend nog redelijk goed dorstlessend voor een biertje. Waarbinnen beetje een bruine suiker smaak even in je mond blijft hangen. Een ideaal biertje om mee te koken
Spendrups Gammeldags Svagdricka;Gr�ngesberg, Sweden;Traditional Ale - Other;Spendrups Bryggeri;500ml bottle. Dark brown with one finger fizzy but quickly fading brown head.

Light mouthfeel, light carbonation and sweet, slightly spiced aftertaste.
Spendrups Gammeldags Svagdricka;Gr�ngesberg, Sweden;Traditional Ale - Other;Spendrups Bryggeri;Deep brown body with a small, fizzy, beige head that ends up as a very thin layer. Sweet and quite strong aroma of malt extract, dark dried fruits and wort, and chocolate in the back. Moderate flavour of malt extract, sweet caramel, wort, white sugar and brown sugar, and fainter notes of dark dried fruits. Heavy sweet taste with just a light bitterness. Full body, syrupy texture, soft carbonation. Too sweet and malty, but an interesting historical beer style, I guess. [50 cl bottle, enjoyed 7 days before BB date, from ICA Bovallstrand, Sweden]

Monte Carlo Raspberry Wheat;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;Colour is just slightly darker than their regular wheat. Aroma is raspberry jam. Flavour is all raspberry. Not overpowering but does nothing for me.
Monte Carlo Raspberry Wheat;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;Winners Wheat with some raspberry flavorings. Put the beers side by side and it�s almost like they poured raspberry syrup into the bottom of the glass before pouring the beer. The aroma was weak, and the flavor disappointing. The palate was unoffensive.

Monte Carlo Raspberry Wheat;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;Tasted just like the Winner's Wheat, except with an infusion of raspberry extract. Sugary-sweet raspberry flavors. Dry, somewhat parching bitterness in the finish -- most likely from the raspberry, as there isn't a large hop profile to speak of. Overall, maybe too sweet for my blood.
Big Horn Randys Pale Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);"Clear and medium golden. Bleached-white, frothy head with thick lace. Not the most inviting aroma. Texture was on the watery side, but had times of creaminess. Malts were light, grainy and cracker-like; hardly any sweetness. Hops were somewhat strong: flowery, grassy and herbal. Slightly acidic. Seemed a bit unbalanced, with the hops overwhelming the light malts. Very dry and somewhat crisp finish. Would've liked to see a bigger malt backbone and more hop aromatics (i.e., finishing hops and/or dry hops)."
Phillips Raspberry Wheat;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Phillips Brewing Co.;0.473l can. Clear amber color with relatively fast disappearing white head. Aroma of raspberry, bread and malt. Taste is sour and little sweet and bitter.
Phillips Raspberry Wheat;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Phillips Brewing Co.;473ml can. Pours a clear amber with pink hue and a medium, frothy, long lasting, off-white head that laces nicely. Mild aroma of raspberry and bready wheat malt. Sweet flavour of raspberry and bready wheat malt with a dry, slightly tart finish. Light body with a thin, watery texture and soft carbonation. Pretty plain and simple, but easy to put back on a hot summer day.
Phillips Raspberry Wheat;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Phillips Brewing Co.;Soft clear red brownish body and minimal foam. Sugary raspberry juice on the nose. Flavour is a mediocre mix of sweet raspberry and malt. Full on the mouth though still sweet and syrupy. A candy-ish beer, there is very little to recommend here.

Phillips Raspberry Wheat;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Phillips Brewing Co.;Visual: (cellared for 6 years). Pours blush red with a dissipating 1cm head, fine ringed retention with an island, raspberry sediment, slow and steady micro streams. Nose: clean fruity raspberry juice, inviting. (lvl-5)-pungency Attack: crisp Mid-palate: thin mouthfeel, off-dry, (lvl-2-sweetness), fruity raspberry jam Finish: dry wheat malt, raspberry exhale, mild artificial sweetener-like roughness Summary: A very basic and straightforward lightly flavoured raspberry wheat ale, not much body or depth to speak of. It's just an easy-drinking brew, barely above average, hardly recommendable nor memorable. The best aspect is the nose.
Phillips Raspberry Wheat;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Phillips Brewing Co.;Appearance: clear ruby-tinged pale amber with one finger of fizzy off-white head settling rapidly to a thin ring, spotty lacing. (3/5) Aroma: tart sweet raspberry, wheat, light funk. (6/10) Taste: moderate tart, moderate-low sweet, minimal bitter. (6/10) Medium-light body, moderate carbonation, off-dry lightly tart finish. (3/5) Starts off with a pleasant raspberry balanced between sweet and tart, but as it warms a little, the fruit aromas diminish a bit and a wheat undertone becomes a not entirely pleasant funk. Not terrible, and not unbalanced, but less than impressive. (12/20)
Phillips Raspberry Wheat;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Phillips Brewing Co.;Tap at Phillips. Pinkish pour. Nice rich raspberry aroma. Fruity taste. Pretty good - I dug it.
Phillips Raspberry Wheat;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Phillips Brewing Co.;Draught at 12 Kings, Vancouver Red color, bright, hazy, with generous compact head. The aroma is not offensive, the flavor makes up for it: artificial strawberry syrup, moderately sweet, some aspartame, with no bitterness. Not a beer. I drink sodas, but I couldn�t drink this.
Phillips Raspberry Wheat;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Phillips Brewing Co.;Draft - Certainly has a red or pink color to it. Not much of a smell. Great raspberry flavor but not a lot of tartness which I was hoping for. The fruit flavor is not very pronounced but well balanced with the hops bitterness.
Phillips Raspberry Wheat;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Phillips Brewing Co.;Nice aroma of fresh raspberries. Clear pink pour with a fizzy white head - no lacing. Nice flavours of wheat, cereal grains, and raspberries. Not overly sweet which is nice. A great beer for summer!
New Albanian St. Alfonzo;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;New Albanian Brewing Company;Overly sweet. I couldn't handle the molasses-like sweetness as soon as it hits the lips. Alcohol was up front as well. Needs re-working, or maybe just an off keg? Burning sugar water.
New Albanian St. Alfonzo;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;New Albanian Brewing Company;BIG Oktoberfest: Dark red/brown color, almost no head. Sweet is the best way for me to describe this one. Almost too sweet at first, but after mulling over it a while, it grew on me. Finished with a strong alcohol kick, just to let you know it could mess you up if no care was taken.
New Albanian St. Alfonzo;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;New Albanian Brewing Company;Incredibly malty with almost no carbonation. Dark plum color. Flavors of brown sugar, prune and almost burnt apples. Somewhat champagny, sticky palate. Would be extremely sweet, almost to the point of cloying for those unfamiliar with quadrupels. I had to have it twice to truly appreciate it. Lovely.
New Albanian St. Alfonzo;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;New Albanian Brewing Company;At Indiana BG Fest: Brown/copper hue with some lacing, good head for a strong ale. Aroma is fruity, malty, barnyard, pine and bubblegum tones. Twangy fruit topped by a sweet caramel taste. Hint of pine undertone. Alcoholic feel and finish. Medium-bodied with a chewy and warming mouthfeel. Not overly sweet, good balance, very quaffable. Nice surprise.
New Albanian St. Alfonzo;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;New Albanian Brewing Company;Draft Only: aroma is very sweet. Beautifully clear copper in color with a thick head of tiny bubbles. It is quite sweet, so I couldn't have very many of these - especially at the well hidden 10%, but makes an excellent finishing beer.
New Albanian St. Alfonzo;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;New Albanian Brewing Company;Draft: Light maple. Dense, sticky foam. Heavily figged aroma. Underlying pine, nuts, apple, toffee, and spicy alcohol. Trace of white grape. Tiny bubbled carbonation sits on the palate beautifully. Leafy, apple flavors. Sweet leathery malts followed by hints of perfume. Long apple finish with a touch of yeast, big juicy caramel notes, and bitter hop leaf. I was expecting this to be overly sweet, as are most American examples. But this displays lovely leaf and yeast flavors, which offset the slight candy sugar sweetness and malt richness with perfection. A truly impressive Quadruple.
New Albanian St. Alfonzo;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;New Albanian Brewing Company;A big Belgian Strong Ale that is awfully sweet for the style IMHO. Notes of honey, light hops and maltiness. Fizzy head. Amber in color. Has a strong alcohol finish.

Taste is balanced to the point of oblivion and I waited for the hoppy finish, promised in the commercial deScription and I could still be waiting. Brewers beware what you promise.

As I popped the cap it was a mini gusher with massive fizzy head. Slow canted pour shows the large fizzy head that retained the whole glass. Aroma is wheat, hints of lemon and dusty yeast. Flavor is sweet grain, lemon, weak banana and faint clove. The flavor overall is an American interpretation of the style because I don�t get authentic German yeast by-products. Still pretty nice. If they can tune down the carbonation it would score a bit higher.

B�rgerbr�u Wolnzacher Roggenbier;Wolnzach, Bavaria, Germany;Specialty Grain-Rye/Roggenbier;B�rgerbr�u Wolnzach;Received in a trade with RBald42. Thanks Ryan! The beer appears hazy and rusty orange hued. Effervescence emanating from the depths of the liquid create an audible fizz. Bonus points for sound quality. The head is a dense white inch, but fades to a thin, wispy layer after only a couple minutes, leaving minimal lacing. The scent brings a lot of fruit character, similar in some regards to a Flanders ale. A healthy malt presence, subtle citrus, mild funk, a touch of sweetness, and a general earthy quality round out the aromas. Well, now I�ve tried a roggenbier. Rye malt is quite present. The beer is fruity and a bit sweet. In contrast, flavors of rye and sourdough breads, as well as an understated funky quality balance out the sweetness. This brew is quite earthy and malty. This is my first experience drinking a roggenbier, and I�m intrigued. I�d definitely like to try some other examples of the style to compare / contrast. The feel is a bit chewy, with the carbonation much less active on the palate than it appeared in the glass. Overall, I must say that this beer is quite different than anything I have had. Unique and tasty. I appreciate the new experience this brew offers and it�s been fun sampling all 104 beer styles. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 04-05-2011
B�rgerbr�u Wolnzacher Roggenbier;Wolnzach, Bavaria, Germany;Specialty Grain-Rye/Roggenbier;B�rgerbr�u Wolnzach;Pretty good. The nose has a lot of citrus and caramel and a faint touch of bananas. The beer by itself is deep amber with a off white foam. If you pour the yeast like a hefe, the beer becomes a brown milk hue. The taste has a rye snap with big citrus notes along with caramel. The beer is crisp and displays a nice refreshing tartness.

I�ll admit up front that this beer was not fresh. But here goes anyway: Pours hazy orange with very small white head. The aroma is banana, onion, lighter fluid, and overripe fruit. The flavor is an odd sourness with banana, lemon, and wheat. It�s interesting but on the weird side.
B�rgerbr�u Wolnzacher Roggenbier;Wolnzach, Bavaria, Germany;Specialty Grain-Rye/Roggenbier;B�rgerbr�u Wolnzach;Based on many revisits of this gem of a beer. Pours amber with some protein globules and a diminishing white head. Smells of lemons, wheat, oranges, lots of tangy qualities, some underlying tarte like hints found in many Jolly Pumpkin beers. Tastes of creamy sweet malt, lots of tangy hints, lemons, some underlying sourness, some wild qualities (accidental?). The palate on this reminds me of a melted milk shake. It is extremely velvety and enjoyable. The finish on this is a nice balance of tarte and full bodied grain. One of the best German beers I have tasted and easily one of my top 20.

Ganter Badisch Weizen Kristallklar;Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Brauerei Ganter Freiburg;I bought this bottle in the Edenka supermarket in Freiburg. I drank it yesterday in the flat, in Freiburg. In my point of view, it is an average kristallbier, nothing exciting but it makes the job to be refresh. The taste is with wheat, some malt, bready, banana, some hop, if I compare with a hefe-weizen, the taste is a bit more crispy and not so sweet, I observe this small point. Second taste and I have found this bottle, at one Getr�nkmarkt, at Kirchzarten. Again, I can write the same and this Kristalweiss is pleasant at the palate, not so subtle but the taste is round and generous with the cereals, littpe side of honey.

It makes for a perfect summer refresher, and would work well with a number of dishes.

Rock Bottom Chicago JBs Extra Special Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Draft, ""Miracle"" fundraiser edition. Hmm... very English, that�s for sure. A short, lact eggshell coloured head capable of giving you a moustache. Dark copper body with a malty smell. Hops are of the English bitter-and-that�s-that domain, which overmatches the toasty English malts. The list of brews showed this to have 50 IBU�s.The bitter aftertaste makes this work well as an example of the style."
Rock Bottom Chicago JBs Extra Special Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Draft, ""Miracle"" version: slightly hazed orange brown, with a creamy head. Decent retention holds the pine needle, sap aroma right over the glass. Palate is grainy, but that is the only malt flavour I can find, mostly dominated by cascade like hops. Not quite as balanced I would have liked, but the quick hop bite in the finish was enjoyable no less..."
Rock Bottom Chicago JBs Extra Special Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom Chicago;Pours with an amber color. Hoppy citrus and pine aroma. Flavor starts with a bit of nice hop character then goes into nice malt flavors. Caramel, dry grain and a bit of nut, this was a very tasty ESB.
Goose Island Rotweizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);This was a half pint at the brewpub. It came in the glass brown with an near tan head. Nose of chocolate and banana. Medium in body with a rich mouth feel. Flavor is rich with lots of roasted malts and banana and cloves. Quite tasty and refreshing. Got better as it warmed.

Goose Island Rotweizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Red color, mix of a dunkel and pale weizen. HAs a bubblegum characteristic and some specialty malts int eh flavor.
Goose Island Rotweizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);At the Clybourn location. I liked this one. Very banana clovey in the yeastiness. On the sweeter side. Nice reddish amber color. Serving: Tap
Goose Island Rotweizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft in a sampler at the Clybourn brewpub. Pours a hazy red-tinted amber color with a small beige head. Notes of wheat, banana, clove, citrus, sweet bread, sugar, and nuts. Medium-bodied, with a wheaty, sweet mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very sweet. On par with the other wheat beers at GI-C at the moment- decent but with something that put me off just a little bit.
Goose Island Rotweizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Pours a cloudy orangish brown with a finger of off white head. Nose and taste is a bit bready, nice malts, banana, a touch of spice. Well balanced and very approachable. I had this beer with a burger which probably wasn�t my best decision. I think this would have been a better desert brew, a bit sweet for a meal beer.
Goose Island Rotweizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);draft at GI clybourn. Caramel color, clove & banana aroma, hefeweizen yeast. Floral & fruity. Dunkle flavor is just a tad watery/light. Very close to being a solid dunkle
Goose Island Rotweizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at Clybourn. Pours a slightly murky reddish brown with a sticky head. Nose is distincly candy and nutty. The wheat really screams in this one. A certain meaty quality as well. On taste, there is more of that meatiness and a chocolate type quality. I�m guessing there is roasted wheat in here based on the flavor profile. Finish is a bit tart. Clove and banana are very present as well. Pretty decent beer, if a bit anomalous.
Goose Island Rotweizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);This one was okay, but not my favorite. On draft at Clybourn brewpub. aroma of wheat and orange. Light orange/red color. Smells of banana, wheat, and orange. taste is wheat, banana, gumball, cloves, sligt sour, light astringent taste. Spicy and very complex. Reminds me of a belgian wit with much more spicey character with a hafeweizen yeast strain.
Goose Island Rotweizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Half Pint draft on tap at the brewpub (Chicago, IL). Pours a rich almost copper pour, maybe a dark amber brownish pour with healthy haze, good fiery glow on the edges with big offwhite maybe almost beige head, laces well. Dies to a thicker film. Aromas are some touches of biscuits, faint toffee, with estery bananas, cloves and touches of spice. Some flaked wheat, bread dough, some touches of deeper sweetness. Spice. Initial is medium bodied with spice and touches of toffee, caramel, biscuits up front. Some banana, toffee, flaked wheat cloves, and spice. The darker bent (but not chocolate or full blown brown sugar) give it some more complexity and lessen the ester influence. Finish is fairly clean, faint spice and fruity ester. An easy drinker, most flavor is offered up front. Not bad, faint darker bent gives it some niceness. Solid wheat.
Goose Island Ordinary Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft: Cloudy lemon. Diminishing foam leaves behind a thin ring. Aroma of toasted husks, apple, lemon zest, and tropical fruits. Crispy, prickly carbonation. Rather brash sweep of salty herbs and dusty yeast triggers the onset of dryness. Benefits from a husky center, which helps to sustain the body. Pleasant fruitiness is next to nil, with the exception of some �off� apple notes. Finishes woodily dry and persistently husky, with a delayed toasted hay commencement that engulfs the earthy hop remnants. Fairly clean aroma, but the hints of butter and apple are tough to ignore. Carbonation is also a bit rough around the edges and the flavor is overly acidic. As Ordinary should be, this is meant to quaff, but that�s all this has to offer, really.
Goose Island Ordinary Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);(Tap, Clark location) Pours a pale yellow body with a medium-sized white head. Aroma of grassy hops and malt. Flavor of mild hops. Basci bitter.
Goose Island Ordinary Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);This was a cool beer. Pale straw yellow, clean nose and clean taste. Slight haze. Nose was a nice hop with minimal malt to it. On the tongue, it was complex in its simplicity, grassy, slightly bitter. The deceiving color resulted in substantial malt sugars to back up the hops. Very nice, very drinkable, very good.
Goose Island Ordinary Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Aroma apples, melons, flowers, grassiness. Taste a complex malt palate of fruit, sweetness, straw, cereal, followed midway with herbal bitterness and a bit of a chalky finish. Not so fond of the finish but I like it overall.
Goose Island Ordinary Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);on tap at clybourn...Poured a crystal yellow with a small white head that didn�t last long. Aromas weren�t abundant here, but some bready, wheaty hints were present. Flavors were quite simple as well, with noticable bitter from start to finish. Just sems to be missing some complexity, but then again it�s ordinary...
Goose Island Ordinary Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Clear, light pale yellow in color with a fluffy snow white head. Numerous bubbles span the inside of the glass. Aroma is muted. Some citric, yeasty acidic hints. Not much excitement leading up to the next step of the rating, but nevertheless... Hits the palate as light and smooth. Thin. The bittering is there, but it�s really discreet. Lemony and some acidity. Sourdough with lemon butter. Like a macro pale lager with an experimental extra helping of hops. Bitter, twangy finish.
Goose Island Ordinary Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Rating for Goose Island Single Hop Ordinary Bitter I was surprised that this was served cold (maybe it just felt cold because it was so hot outside...) Golden-bodied with a creamy white head that laced well. Bitter aromas were flowery hops with a touch of pine atop a grainy background. Lightly bitter throughout with a breadiness in the flavor. Medium-bodied and creamy. On tap at Goose Island Beer Company (Clybourn), Chicago, IL
Goose Island Ordinary Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Not bad. Light on the sprucey-tasting hops, very fruity. Garden variety pale ale brewpub aroma and color. Went very well with the food, moderate to light sweetness in the pale malt character. Not a whole lot of complexity, but it's a very drinkable brew.
Goose Island Ordinary Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Not half bad. A bit fruitier and lighter than your average bitter. Approval.

Goose Island Maibock;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Location: Draft at the Wrigleyville location, 7/6/14 Aroma: It has a solid malty aroma, somewhat sweet, lots of caramel Appearance: The pour of this one is amber-orange with a sheet of off-white colored head Flavor: Flavor-wise, it is similar to the nose, leans sweet, lots of caramel, some mild bitterness Palate: The body is medium-plus, it has a sticky mouthfeel, and a decently long finish Overall Impression: This is a solid, malt-forward beer.

Aromas are sweeter, bready malts pair with caramel, some sweet breads, a touch cakey with light florals, toast, touches of warming alcohol spirit. Sticky sweet with some green apple, pie.

Murky brown hue with a fading small beige head and minimal lace. The aroma has notes of chocolate, oat, biscuit, smoke, dusty yeast, aromatic light tobacco and a hint of coffee. The taste starts with heavy roasted malt overtones, bready and nutty with a lush chocolate background. I found a hint of prune and coffee in midsection and the brew finished slight oxidized and dry. The mouth feel is lively and sharp at first before the dusty finish. A workable brew that seemed a tad old for some reason.

Franklins Oatmeal Stout (through 2010);Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;On tap. Deep, dark and dull mahogany pour with no head. Aroma is strongly of roasty coffee and malts with hints of chocolate. Thin mouthfeel. Dark roasty malts and coffee/bitter chocolate dominate the flavor. A dry, black coffee bitter finish with some sourness. Seems more like a porter to me. Definitely lacks the smoothness and body of other oatmeal stouts I�ve had. Slightly above average carbonation and at 6% ABV a surprising warming presence of alcohol. If this is a leftover from the winter, it has aged harshly.
Roffey Overcast IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IPA;Roffey Brewing (Robert Thomas Brewing);Medium body, moderate bitterness and hop aroma/flavor. At first I thought it was a rather strong example, but it falls in the weak end of the spectrum.

Riverside Pissed Off Stout;Riverside, California, United States;Stout;Riverside Brewing Company (CA);I went up and expected this to live up to its name...what I got was something that barely rivaled a Guinness Draft. It pours a brownish mix with a nicely thinned out tannish head. First of all, call it weird, but I was getting yeasty aromas all over this one. Although it wasnt the predominant aroma, it was there for some reason or another. Coffee and vanilla malt were the common aromas with hints of chocolate, as is to be expected of a stout. This beer was absolutely nitroed...very creamy taste, SUPER light in taste...watery...somewhat of a cocoa bean taste with subtle hints of coffee. It ends very bitterly, and abruptly. This was far from Pissed Off...frankly it put me to sleep. Next....
Riverside Pissed Off Stout;Riverside, California, United States;Stout;Riverside Brewing Company (CA);Dark as night as can be expected with a decent head. Had on cask, Kind of a tweaked coffee aroma, subtle hints of some dried fruits. Had a real funky ass taste to it, rye was the strangest of the flavors and it also had a sourish belgian thing going on, but both these took back seat to the traditional deep coffee and choco flavs.

Dremel Dunkel;Wattendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Brauerei Dremel;Bottle from a REWE in Bamberg. Copper coloured, with a slight, white, head and touch of carbonation. Sweet, brown sugar and berry fruit aroma. Flavour was similar with some toastiness in the finish. Fine.

Dremel Dunkel;Wattendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Brauerei Dremel;"Das dunkle Dremel sch�umt sahnig-fein, aber nicht sehr hoch auf. Den Duft kann man als karamel-s��lich beschreiben. Das kann man dann auch im Antrunk schmecken: Erst Karamel, dann R�stmalz (verhalten, nicht als Explosion), dann brotig-malziger Abgang. Mal ganz was anderes. Vom Kollegen Frankenland wei� ich, dass bei Dremel ""handwerklich gebraut"" wird, also jeder Sud ein bisschen anders schmeckt. Dieser, aus dem meine Flasche stammt, sei nicht so gelungen. Das erkl�rt wohl auch den Hauch von zu lange getragener Socke, der �ber dem ganzen Geschmackserlebnis liegt und eine bessere Bewertung verhindert. Dennoch: ordentlich Test vom 19.1.2010, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 9,10,9,9,4,9 - 8,90"

Dremel Dunkel;Wattendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Brauerei Dremel;Pours into the glass a hazelnut brown beer with a beautiful, delicate, pearly head. The Dunkles has a caramel malt aroma, subtle nutty-malty and roasty-sweet. It is also malty bitter with sweet flavors in the background. The aftertaste shows hoppy-bitter. The further course is also nice hoppy-bitter. Another well-balanced Dremel beer!

Back Street Olaf Pale Ale;Yorba Linda, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Back Street Brewery (Yorba Linda);On tap at the Vista location: Slightly hazed golden hue with some head and lace. The aroma has notes of grassy and herbal hops, apple ester, corny and biscuity malt. The taste has a twangy fruit and pale biscuity malt character. A hint of DMS on the short profile, not much depth. The mouth feel is light and lively. A very average paint-by-numbers APA.
Back Street Olaf Pale Ale;Yorba Linda, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Back Street Brewery (Yorba Linda);This beer poured an amber/orange mix with a thiny sheet white head. The aroma was filled with citrus and hops while also mixing in a strange bready/grainy presence. The taste yielded something a little different. Some lemon and orange dominate with a malty tang right up front. It ends dry with a slight malty, dare i say raisinesque quality. Not too bad, but very unoriginal. The sweetness becomes too much to handle by the finish.
Back Street Olaf Pale Ale;Yorba Linda, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Back Street Brewery (Yorba Linda);A typical yellowish amber color with the moderate head which leaves with a quickness. Hoppy yet malty on both the aroma and taste, boring, nothing special here. No sac what so ever.

Goose Island 15 Year ESB;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);15 Year Bitter. Poured a rich amber color with little, but persistent, head. The aroma has a nice malty fruit character with nice hops in the finish. The flavor is also quite enjoyable.

Goose Island 15 Year ESB;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Almost no aroma percepted, even when warm, and then, jsut a smattering of dusty hops.

Not as good as I had hoped.

The nose has really softened out over the years, aroma had more than a nod to diluted malt whisky with some sweetness. Some almonds in the mouth along with a touch of icing sugar. I used to drink this regularly in the late eighties and early nineties as it was my most local brewery so it was a great and welcome surprise to see Steve bring a bottle of this along , cheers Steve. This actually tasted better than in the pub, certainly in the last few years of its life as a brewpub, as in the last few years of its existence the quality and consistency of Bodicote beers slipped somewhat.
Bodicote No.9;Bodicote, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bodicote;A Mes rate: Bottle at Chris O�s Pre GBBF Tasting Thanks to Steve for this 15 year old rarity. Red amber colour with the head not surviving. Kinda like an old man who has lost his hair. Sadly this has decended into the grips of petrol. Lots of caramel, the hops are totally gone but the aged flavours of the malt still work pretty well. I would never have this to have expected this long actually. Impressed.
Bodicote No.9;Bodicote, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bodicote;Bottled, 1993 vintage. Amber colour, small head. Aroma is raisins, slight maltyness and caramel. Flavour is wood, sweet malts, fruity hops along with earth and raisins.

Bodicote No.9;Bodicote, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bodicote;Cask Conditioned at Plough, Bodicote. This mid brown beer is the most popular of the Bodicote Beers. Named after the house number of the Pub this is a strongly flavoured bitter with plenty of dry hop quality. Sharp malt flavours complement the overall taste. Jim has been brewing at the pub since 1982 and has a regular custom from many appreciative locals.
Bodicote Triple X;Bodicote, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Bodicote;Cask Conditioned at Plough, Bodicote. Jim's strong Winter Warmer, mid to dark brown, fluffy head. Strong alcohol flavours dominate the drinking of this beer, little subtelty, just out and out brandy like flavour.
Bodicote Porter;Bodicote, Oxfordshire, England;Porter;Bodicote;Oxford Beer Fest. Gravity. Mine was called Old English Porter with an abv of 4.4% - and I have a website which lists both the Porter and the Old English Porter, but the brewery's own website doesn't list the Old English. Waffle, waffle, waffle. It's late, and I've a belly full of beer. What am I saying? Who knows. Who cares. Who will even read this. Uhem. Murky brown. Initial hit is very pleasing - a huge rush of licorice and sasparilla - but soon fades into a mustiness of little distinction. Some sour fruit and aged oak notes. Some slightly rancid raspberry. gets more interesting. Flavours swirl around. Mmmm. A curious beer. Fruit flavours becoming stronger. Interesting.
Bodicote Porter;Bodicote, Oxfordshire, England;Porter;Bodicote;Cask Conditioned at The Plough, Bodicote. In my opinion, and many others, this is Jim's finest. Dark Ruby Red almost Black in colour with a thick malty head. A blast of fruit and nut flavour bursts into the mouth on tasting. Ignore the strength rating, this varies enormously, at Banbury Beer Festival a Cask is held back for 6 months and is really in peak condition. This a chewey dark flavoufull beer that warms the cockles.
Bodicote 3 Goslings;Bodicote, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bodicote;Cask Conditioned at Plough, Bodicote. Pale yellow amber beer, thin white head. Not subtle, a straight hoppy pale ale, thinnish little character.

Abbeydale Moonshine;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Abbeydale Brewery;Appearance slightly cloudy dark yellow in colour. Not much going on the old bugle, some floral notes and bitter hops. The taste was of floral blossom, hops, grass, some caramel and a really bitter hoppy aftertaste. I would give it another go, to make sure my tastebuds weren�t deceiving me, but I wasn�t impressed.

Dieu du Ciel! Mondix Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;18 month aged draught. Dark copper with minimal head.Site lists it as an American Strong Ale but at the brewpub they were calling it an Imperial IPA. It was obviously hoppy and floral and orangey-citric but it didn�t have the big kick I think of for an Imp. IPA. Smooth, slightly bitter medium body with flavours of orange and caramel sweetness with a fairly dry but nice long finish. Very drinkable.
Dieu du Ciel! Mondix Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;On tap aged 18 months at the brewpub. Golden orange in colour.

Very well done.
Dieu du Ciel! Mondix Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Like a barleywine-light. Very nice malt aroma and flavor-hops seem to have faded since it was aged a year. Could use a bit more carbonation to keep it from being cloying, but a nice beer overall.

Dieu du Ciel! Mondix Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;18 months old version - tasted on DDC 6th anniversary. Splendid lightly cloudy amber body topped with a large and lasting off-white head. Its definitely hoppy aroma is accompanied by a complex and quite pleasant mix of caramel, toffee and sweet hints. Taste generates a hoppy party in your mouth. There�s also some vineous, smokey and brown sugar notes. It ends with a gorgeous bitter final. I may seem to be generous in my rating, but that version is undoubtedly outstanding!
Dieu du Ciel! Mondix Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Average score posted.Original: Assertive citrus (orange) hop nose.

(7-3-7-3-14=3.4) Re-rated at 6th anniversary party. Aged 18 months - what a difference (7-4-8-5-16=4.0) Mild floral hops, caramel, dark fruit all meld wonderfully in this complex, spicy aroma. Opaque burnished copper with strong, dense off-white head that recedes slowly with some lacing. Very assertive and clean bitterness with huge chewey malty caramel flavours. Light floral hop notes. Syrup-like thick mouthfeel. On tap at the brewpub.
Dieu du Ciel! Mondix Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Amber and hazy robe. Caramel and orange nose. Sweet taste: mango, orange lemon, caramel. It doesnt really make its 8% ABV. Good beer, but this style holds many superior contenders.

Bluegrass Hoppy Hefe;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Wheat Ale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;What was supposed to be a Hefeweizen, Hoppy Hefe was a bit too much on the hops. What we have here is a hoppy Hefe. Clear golden yellow, like a pilsner. Could be a hoppy pilsner instead. Overall, pretty damn tasty.
Bluegrass Helles Bock;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bluegrass Brewing Company;SLightly malty, somewhat hoppier than I would have expected. QUite an interesting brew for what it was supposed to be. I have still not decided about this one.
Bluegrass Helles Bock;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Not much here. Unimpressive. No real discernible flavors. I think this has less flavor than a Shiner bock.

Mogollon Superstition Pale Ale;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mogollon Brewing Company;"Color: a clear, bright apricot, with tiny, yeasty(?!?) travellers swimming hither and thither. Head: small, brief, white. Aroma is soft amd swept clean, but slowly unfolds with malty tones of caramel and nuts. Faintly fruity, otherwise lacking in hops. On palate, a bit sharp, at first, with a coppery twang. Eventually, hops assert themselves, but the mouthfeel was not a pleasant experience. The roughness I felt subsides some, and the pieces come together more in the middle. Still, the flavors compete a bit too much. Something about what I could only call a ""dull, ringing aftertaste"" spoiled this ale for me. Body is medium, texture good, but not a smooth ride, when that�s what�s called for with a pale ale."
Mogollon Superstition Pale Ale;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mogollon Brewing Company;Draught at Mogollon Brewing Company, Flagstaff, Arizona.

Sternbr�u Schl�sselfeld Vollbier;Schl�sselfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Scheubel - Sternbr�u Schl�sselfeld;From draft at the brewery in Schlusselfeld. Clear and sparkling rich gold with a fine white head. Medium bodied, chewy and rich in the mouth with a strong caramelized pale malt character and substantial roughness. Hops are herbal and green and lends it a strong bitterness and against the moderately-low sweetness. It�s also strongly carbonic and sulfuric and a little too rough which seems like short lagering. Has the richness and sharpness more suited to Festbier and Bockbier than Helles, not exactly drinkable given the roughness, but also not overly flawed.

Dieu du Ciel! Menace de Dieu;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Cask on Feb.9, 2006. Orange golden ale with a thin white head. Light caramel and crisp hops in aroma. In mouth, good malt base with peppery hops, light citrus and medium bodied.
Buckeye Cream Ale;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Cream Ale;Buckeye Brewing Company;Bottle from Brigadier...thanks Nathan! Was looking forward to trying this one after a weekend of lots of dark, sweet beer. Pours clear yellow with little cascading bubbles floating up to a small foamy white head. Aroma is lightly peppery and sweet, with sweet, crackery malt. A touch of spicy hops. Taste is herbal hops, white pepper, and not much of a malt base. It�s mineral and dry, with real pale malt. Carbonation bites way too much, but the body is light like I expected. Not too bad.
Buckeye Cream Ale;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Cream Ale;Buckeye Brewing Company;"Keeps a great white head over a light gold body, brilliantly clear body. A little bit of green apple fruitiness with a faint banana ester and a nice clean low grainy malt aroma, no hop, and a very subtle hint of DMS as it warms. Flavor is slightly grainy malt with a hop back up in the finish and aftertaste; very well balanced and clean for the most part. A slight bit of fruitiness in the finish as well. Not what I'd expect from a cream ale, but pleasantly surprised. Not terribly complex, but what cream ale is. Carbonation is high and body is on the fuller side of light w/ a slightly dry m/f. ""Very quaffable"" as Garin would say. I say it's very good and thirst quenching, better than the standards IMHO, if only a bit overhopped for cream ale style."
Buckeye Cream Ale;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Cream Ale;Buckeye Brewing Company;"Had this at B&O Brewing in Youngstown - The waitress set it down and said ""Cream Ale"" - I later found out it was a guest tap from Buckeye. Aroma is citrus. Body is clear yellow - good head and lacing. At first, I was confused - flavor is citrus up front, very creamy and malty, and the finish is super crisp, filled with a peppery, spicey hop - except for the clear body, it almost seemed like a Wit or Hefe. Then she said ""Cream Ale"" - wow - Usually that reminds me of Genesee and I run screaming from the room. I could happily drink a couple of growlers of this while mowing my lawn."

Outer Banks Ringwood Stout;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Dry;Outer Banks Brewing Station;I'm not sure if it was from the yeast they used, but the front of this is very bright but acidic. Malts were grainy and slightly chalky, but full of roast. Finish was short, roasted flavors lingered.
Outer Banks ESB;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Outer Banks Brewing Station;"On tap as ""Happy Tappy ESB"". Pours deep amber with no head, tiny ring of suds and no retention. Caramel malty nose. This has a nice body, starting with a caramel sweetness. As the British pale malts and accompanying Fuggles hops decorate the back of the tongue (and lengthy at that!), a fruity ester finish provides the end of a nice pull. This feels complex, while not too heavy. Good integration here, and very well done. Very good for a session. (If only the appearance were just a shade nicer... a bit more pillow on top would make this an honest brew.)"
Outer Banks ESB;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Very nice bitter. Has a flavor like a good English ale. Finish is very dry and refreshing.
Outer Banks ESB;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Medium brown color - thick white head with good lacing. Malty flavor with a dry biting and bitter finish. Very clean,quenching and enjoyable.
Outer Banks ESB;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Outer Banks Brewing Station;"It seemed a bit dry like the other OBX beers I sampled with a similar malty overtone but laced with an apple-like caramel flavor in there. This isn�t a bad beer but its nothing out of the ordinary either. This one is now known as the ""Red Flagship ESB."""
Outer Banks ESB;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Light golden brown, with white head. Hoppy aroma. Lots of flavor--citrousy. Good finish. This one really tasted more like an IPA to me, but it is still great.
Outer Banks ESB;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Burnt orange with a resident light foam topping. Immediate hop flowering in the nose. Taste is hoppy, yet toasty and reminds me of cracked wheat.
Outer Banks ESB;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Starts malty, with a very pleasant biscuity flavor in the middle. It finishes with a surprisingly strong hop flavor, earthy in profile, probably the Goldings speaking up. I'm not a big ESB fan, but I liked this one.
Outer Banks ESB;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Outer Banks Brewing Station;A nice, assertively hopped, ESB. Malts were fruity and bready, but thin. Hops are the main show here - this was nearly as hoppy as their IPA. Long bitter finish. Nice and sessionable.

Pearl Street Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pearl Street Brewery;"10/19/18. On tap at the brewery. Definitely old school here. Orange pour with a nice off-white head that sticks and laces well. Floral aroma, earthy, touches of black tea and caramel. Floral hop character, medium bitterness, some spice, grass, tea, and earth; lingering caramel sweetness. Not terribly made, but definitely old school and just not my style."

Pearl Street Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pearl Street Brewery;Out to brunch with family and all my aunts and uncles were getting bloody mary�s and pressured me into it and the odd thing about getting a bloody mary in this part of world is it automatically comes with a chaser. so opted for this La Crosse local. fine orange pour. nose is earthy hops. tastes bready, earthy, malty, and some orange zest. medium carbonated. fine straight up pale ale.
Pearl Street Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pearl Street Brewery;Not too impressed with this. Had it in a bottle and poured into glass. Decent color and aroma but the hops bitterness didn�t do it for me

Pearl Street Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pearl Street Brewery;Bottle poured a clear tarnished gold with a small lasting amber head.

Pearl Street Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pearl Street Brewery;12 ounce bottle. A white head sits atop a rich yellow glowing body. A subtle but fresh hoppy aroma can be noticed from across the table. The flavor is mildly hoppy and unlike so many pale ales out there, this ones got a light maltiness backing up the hops but not so much that it�s filling. Great Wisconsin beer love it.
Pearl Street Pale Ale;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pearl Street Brewery;Draft. From notes. Herbal and citrus hops with bready and caramel malts. Not too shabby.
Pearl Street D.T.B. Brown;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Pearl Street Brewery;Bottle. It poured a rich brown color with a tan head. It's aroma was roasted malt, chocolate and a nice nuttiness. It was semi-sweet in taste as well.
Pearl Street D.T.B. Brown;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Pearl Street Brewery;10/19/18. On tap at the brewery. Dark brown pour with hints of red edges under a small off-white head that fades to a ring but sticks. Hint of spice and floral on the aroma, light caramel and nuts. Toasty flavor, bread, toast, biscuit, hint of caramel, nuts, spice. Nothing special.
Pearl Street D.T.B. Brown;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Pearl Street Brewery;Not a huge fan of this brown ale. Malts aren't aggressive enough. Neither sweet nor roasty. Weak caramel and toffee. Tried with the family in 2018 at Northern Lights.
Pearl Street D.T.B. Brown;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Pearl Street Brewery;Tap at the LaCrosse, WI airport. Pours pretty, a rich woody brown color with a foamy ivory head. Nose is straight nuttiness and roasty malts. Pretty straightforward for the style to the point of plainness. Just simple roast, nuts and some earth but nothing to distinguish it.
Pearl Street D.T.B. Brown;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Pearl Street Brewery;"Nice ""Session"" beer... roasted malts, nutty, sweet... but enough hops to counter the hops. perhaps a bit thin."

Pearl Street D.T.B. Brown;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Pearl Street Brewery;On the thin and light side of the brown ale scale but pleasant enough. Light earthy, nutty notes keep it from being a total snooze.
Pearl Street D.T.B. Brown;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Pearl Street Brewery;Light and not very memorable. Tasted fine tho, just sort of generic overall
Pearl Street El Hefe;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pearl Street Brewery;I had this at Pearl Street Brewing. Pours cloudy gold with a white head. Taste banana, sweet, clove. I thought this was good. I would drink this again. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Pearl Street El Hefe;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pearl Street Brewery;10/19/18. On tap at the brewery. Lightly hazed orange pour with a small khaki head that fades to a ring. Light banana aroma, hints of citrus, spice. Light flavor, effervescent, banana, dough, touch of spice, just a hint at citrus and cream. A bit light/thin and one dimensional. Eh.
Pearl Street El Hefe;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pearl Street Brewery;Looks the part but drinks more like a wheat ale than a hefe. Some wheat but have to use your imagination to get much banana or clove.
Pearl Street El Hefe;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pearl Street Brewery;Overall not bad. My gripe with this beer is it is too bland. There is cloves and subtle banana but notthe punch I want Carb level is good and bubbly. I would buy again if there was no other hefe around.
Pearl Street El Hefe;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pearl Street Brewery;Appearance�s a hazy, dull amber with a very short lived head and no lace.

Pearl Street El Hefe;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pearl Street Brewery;Gold color. A little cloudy. Lightly sweet. Typical hefeweizen flavors, banana and clove, but the palate is too thin and the flavors are too light, almost like a kristalweizen.
Pearl Street El Hefe;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pearl Street Brewery;Refrigerated 12 oz. brown squat bottle poured into a weizen glass.

Not interested in trying again.
Pearl Street El Hefe;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pearl Street Brewery;2 oz. pour, on tap at the brewery�s taproom, as part of an 8-beer flight. Consumed on 5-14-14. Yeasty aroma features scents of bubbelgum, candy, overripe banana, and a touch of salt. Excellent smell. Pours a hazy, cloudy, light gold. Effervescent. Off-white head. Flavors of bubblegum and lemon / tonic water tartness. Light body. Frothy in the palate. Insubstantial palate effects. Overall, an enjoyable hefeweizen, and quite enjoyable for an American example of the style. Grossly underrated here at RateBeer, in my opinion.
Pearl Street El Hefe;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pearl Street Brewery;Murky maize with a quickly withering medium white crown. Aroma is a bit odd at first then is grassy and herbal with lemon, bready malt and yeast. Taste is a bit strange too a mishmash of herbal notes, lemon, yeast and comes off a bit sour and bland.
Pearl Street El Hefe;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pearl Street Brewery;"I had this one at the taproom inside the brewery. It was served in a pilsner glass adorned with a wedge of lemon. It looked good on that hot afternoon with its big rocky head and cloudy yellow-orange hue. It smelled a little like banana taffy and nutmeg. The first sip left me with a white moustache ;) The flavor was as exciting as the alluring aroma. Tart and tangy with a honey sweet finish. I had to ask the quite attractive bartender for another! A also asked her what the story was with the curious name of this beer and she told me it was a double entendre. I played it like I knew what she was talking about and quickly Googled it when she was off pouring someone else a beer. When she came back, I asked her to explain this play on words and she said that ""hefe"" means yeast in German but ""el jefe"" (pronounced el hefe) means ""the boss"" in Spanish. I asked her her name and she said ""call me el hefe""."

Pearl Street Thats What I'm Talkin Bout Organic Rolled Oat Stout;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Pearl Street Brewery;Black brew sitting under an impressive head of tan foam. Roasted malt dominates the smell with both sweet and bitter notes. Chocolate is there and provides most of the bitterness. Chocolate is on the sweet side in the taste.

Pearl Street Thats What I'm Talkin Bout Organic Rolled Oat Stout;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Pearl Street Brewery;Good flavor, but watery and very flat. This bottle also had a moderate metallic flavor from oxidation.
Pearl Street Thats What I'm Talkin Bout Organic Rolled Oat Stout;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Pearl Street Brewery;At the end of the day most of the time Organic is a label to get you to buy bad beer- not this time. Enjoyable Stout- great choice now that the weather is cooling off. Small brewery doing something right!
Pearl Street Thats What I'm Talkin Bout Organic Rolled Oat Stout;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Pearl Street Brewery;Bottle. Nice aroma. Thick, syrup feel detracts from from the overall quality. Good taste (I�ve become bias toward stouts, porters, nutbrowns, etc.) Not a thirst quenching summer beer, but a nice autumn brew.

Pearl Street Thats What I'm Talkin Bout Organic Rolled Oat Stout;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Pearl Street Brewery;Bottle from the brewery. Black pour - cool looking. Beige head.

Bitter End M Pale Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;On draught in a snifter. The sign on the wall says it�s a barleywine. Cloudy, golden & orange color with an excellent head, nice lacing and very small bubbles. The aroma is sweet, malty, orange and some hops. The flavor is sweet, malty, orange with a very smooth hop profile. The bitterness is not what you get in a NW barleywine but there is plenty there. This is a very smooth beer that is quite drinkable given its perceived alcohol content (8-10%?). Excellent beer!
Bitter End M Pale Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Tap. Pours a murky but bright orange color with a rocky white head and good lacing. This has a nice citrus and fruit aroma. Big hop flavor with a good malt background and a velvety smooth texture. I don�t know if the one I had was aged or new but it was very smooth. Great beer.
Bitter End M Pale Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Tap. Nice-looking in a wine glass: glowing orange-amber, level and foamy head. Very sharp aroma, saying ""Yield to incoming bitterness and hoppiness"". And indeed, that's what comes. It tastes similar to an Arrogant Bastard, with the expected strong citrus-grapefruit flavor and aggressive Chinook hops. Mildly off aftertaste made me ponder giving it a 3 in palate, but if you're gonna run with the big boys, ya gotta be able to handle it. A good beer."
Bitter End M Pale Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;This was the best of show at the TCBF - IMO. Even with a smaller pour it shows what I like in a barleywine, complexity of malt and hop as they play happily in the Texas sun as it eats my lunch. My notes became much as others by this point leading me to but a sketch and recollection that I will be having this again. Yum.
St Peters Brewery Killaghs Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout;St Peters Brewery (Australia);Bottle - pours black with a tan head. Sulphuroc aroma. First taste is really sour, then there is a light roast flavour. Not much to say about this one!
St Peters Brewery Killaghs Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout;St Peters Brewery (Australia);Explosive head out of the bottle not a good start. Unbalanced sourness predominates over a bad char and spice base. Unrefined to say the least. Maybe a bad bottle.
St Peters Brewery Killaghs Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout;St Peters Brewery (Australia);Bottle (640ml). Poured opaque with a huge, tanned, fluffy head which filled the glass, but with time it settled to a average sized head which was mostly diminishing. Aroma had unpleasant sulfuric notes (like all the other bottled St Peters brews I have sampled) with strong notes of acidic dark grapes, tart blackberries and hints of roasted chocolate malts hiding underneath the mess. Flavor was offensive with strong acidic notes, sour dark grapes, tart blackberries, notes of burnt plastic, roasted chocolate malts that�s are petty much non existent and a dry metallic finish. Light to medium bodied with lively carbonation, dry texture, watery mouthfeel and a bad finish. All the St Peters beers I have had (all bottled) have been an utter waste of money, judging from some other ratings I must have picked up 3 bad batches from 3 different brews, although I still don�t think I would bother buying any of them again.
St Peters Brewery Killaghs Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout;St Peters Brewery (Australia);Nice roasted malt nose, but mouth is thin and sour, though backed up with solid roastiness. Unbalanced and mediocre at best.
St Peters Brewery Killaghs Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout;St Peters Brewery (Australia);A fairly pleasant stout if you get a good bottle. After striking out first time around, I took the risk and picked up a second bottle of this and my decision was vindicated. Lovely aroma of creamy chocolate with a touch of roasted coffee. On tasting it drops a little, with a bit of a minerally watery flavour coming through. That taste was the same as what dominated the dodgy bottle, so obviously it�s a fault of some description but I have no idea what. Anyway, it was fairly pleasant drinking if not a little on the sweet side. Would have it again but coming in a pint plus sized bottled I�d probably want to share it.
St Peters Brewery Killaghs Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout;St Peters Brewery (Australia);Good to see St Peters� products turning up in bottles. Their stuff seems to be a bit hit and miss but this sweetish stout/porter is more the former than the latter. It took a bit of encouragement to summon a short, reluctant head but it hung around well. The aroma is all soft mocha coffee or perhaps coffee ice cream. Quite a few sugars in there - in fact it summons images of a leaner cousin to Redoak�s Belgian Choc Stout, in smell at least. If I have a criticism, it�s that it�s a bit thin - like it�s going to lack guts. Medium-bodied but with a nice thick finish. Soft chocolate malt flavours, sweet and very gentle. Classic souring finish but with very low bitterness for the style. Milk chocolate with some vanilla essence. Very much at the dessert end of the stout scale. Very easy drinking - if all stouts tasted like this, they might even find a mass market. The kind of stout you could take home to meet your parents. Polite and well rounded. Won�t rub anyone up the wrong way. (640ml bottle from Liquor on Parade, Kingsford. 5% abv)
St Peters Brewery Killaghs Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout;St Peters Brewery (Australia);On tap at The Union. Burnt sugarcane, licorice. Good kick in the first sip, but drifted away from there, with a bit of a dregsy finish.
St Peters Brewery Killaghs Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout;St Peters Brewery (Australia);On tap at the pumphouse brewery. Pours a dark reddish brown with a medium ivory colored head. Has a great roasted chocolate aroma. Flavor is of berries, roasted and chocolate malts and seems to be quite milky. The finish is long with a substantial chocolate residual. Low in hops.
St Peters Brewery Killaghs Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout;St Peters Brewery (Australia);pretty odd stuff. dunno if you'd call it a stout, had no creaminess, no texture to speak of. dark purple with detergent froth. first pint was exciting - plenty of burnt bitterness, roof-of-the-mouth malt, nice and warm. the 2nd and 3rd pints weren't as satisfying, each beer was flatter than the one previous and the flavour less complex - just a hit of burnt stale hops and it was gone. anywaze, interesting and unlike any beer tasted previously
St Peters Brewery Killaghs Stout;Sydney, Australia;Stout;St Peters Brewery (Australia);"another one of the one-off cask ales at the suit-infested nags. there's no way this qualifies as a stout, but whatever it is (porter? old ale?) it's not that bad anyway. just not a stout. clear darkish red with no head (of course), just a dribble of white foam round the side. flavours are fairly fresh and inyerface, but don't come together very well - heaps of coffeeish chocolate malt, round Goldings dryhopped flavour, and fairly powerful hoppy (as opposed to roasty) bitterness. in fact there's no discernible roastiness at all which is weird for a ""stout"". oily, vanilla and licorice tinged yeasty finish. not a lot of guts in the malt department either."
Grand Rapids Irish Amber Rye Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Had a draft at their brewery. Golden pour. Foamy white. Crazy bitter and almost offensive Leaves a bad aftertaste
Grand Rapids Irish Amber Rye Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;"After sampling a few Grand Rapids Brewing ales during ""Irishfest,"" I forgot the names of the seasonals! I've found the name of this one, so here goes my rate. This ale was amber colored with a thin tan/white head. Flavor was, alas, very thin and weak. Grains were discernible, but the body lacked complexity and character. Not an impressive offering. Now...if I can only find the name of their seasonal stout..."
Laguna Beach Greeters Pale Ale;Laguna Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Laguna Beach Brewing;"On tap. I got the sampler at this brewery/restaurant while watching a football game there. This APA is not their best brew; they have a very good Red Ale and a Belgian that is quite nice as well. This APA is fairly typical but had just a bit of something odd, paper-like in the finish. Probably worth another try."
Laguna Beach Greeters Pale Ale;Laguna Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Laguna Beach Brewing;(tap) I found Laguna Beach BC, and headed it. I only had time to have one beer and decided for the Pale Ale. The head was... pretty un-beer like, reminded me of pop or macro-brewed beer. It was cloudy, dirty brownish color. So, first impression wasn't all that good. But it was fresh, a typical pale ale flavor. Nice aroma, nice hoppiness. It was really quite enjoyable. Wish i had had time for another.
West Virginia Raspberry Wheat;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;West Virginia Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. Pours a hazy light amber color with a medium thin white head that diminishes steadily. Stringy lacing. Light raspberry and earthy malt in the nose. Light-bodied with notes of tart raspberry, wheat and bland malt flavoring. The finish is short and tart with a light raspberry aftertaste. Forgettable overall.
West Virginia Raspberry Wheat;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;West Virginia Brewing Company;11/1/07 - Sample at brewpub. Raspberry + American Wheat + ick + skunk + bad after taste = eh. This may have been old. Not a ver good representation by an otherwise good brewery.
West Virginia Raspberry Wheat;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;West Virginia Brewing Company;Pinky-, honey-gold, light lacy head. Raspberry, light vinegar, malt aroma. Slight sulphury notes there amidst the raspberry. Lightly sweet. Grassy tones near the finish. Medium light body. Quick finish, lightly bittered with berry vapor. Kinda nice, but I think I liked the apricot variant a notch better.
West Virginia Raspberry Wheat;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;West Virginia Brewing Company;Draft... Hazy orange ale with a small, fizzy, white head. Grainy, fruity aroma with notes of mash, wheat and very subtle raspberry and red apple. The flavor has all the same characteristics as the nose and it leans only a hair on the sweet side of balance. Medium-bodied with lively carbonation. Crisp, dry finish. Refreshing. A pleasant surprise as I�m not really into fruit or wheat beers.
West Virginia Raspberry Wheat;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;West Virginia Brewing Company;"Sample at the brewpub. Pale, hazy salmon color; weak, though fairly fresh fruity aroma with a bit of grassiness. Soft body, nice fruitiness, bit of lime with the red raspberry, just a tiny bit of sourness at the end."
West Virginia Raspberry Wheat;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;West Virginia Brewing Company;s wit with rasberry flavors. the fruit content of this is ideal giving this a sweet body as well as a pleasant tart fruitiness. one of the better fruit wheats.
West Virginia Raspberry Wheat;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;West Virginia Brewing Company;Not in their usual line-up but it should be. Raspberry very subtle in the aroma in lieu of wheat. But it is in the flavor where the subtledly yet distinctly soothing combination takes place (with raspberry doing much better now). A hazy, off-pink/peach color. Good stuff! (on tap, Pennsylvania Microbrewers Fest 2003)
Seidel Pils;Drammen, Norway;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aass Bryggeri;Came home after a hard days work, looking forward to a cold beer! I saw this in the supermarket, so I decided to try it. It was ice cold and looked so beautiful in the glass..Hmmm.. looking forward to enjoy this!! It was horrible!!! Taste like shit! So sweet and just very bad. First time in my life I had to pour down a beer in the sink. Thankfully I had another beer in fridge that saved the day. I'm sure this one is made for those who have serious problems with alcohol... cheap cheap cheap.

Seidel Pils;Drammen, Norway;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aass Bryggeri;I can understand why this beer is so cheap. The overall look is actually okay. As a pilsner it has a light color which i like, however, the taste i awful. Overall i rate this beer a 1/10

Greifenklau Weizen;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Privater Brauereigasthof Greifenklau;Sampled after Caesar nearly killed me following him on a bicycle uphill to this place. Great biergarten but after nearly dying from dragging my fat ass up that hill after cycling about 50 km up and down around Bamberg already today, not even the beer could help me anymore. Though that was mainly because the beer wasn't very good. Nonetheless, I'm happy I got there and got to try em. Alive and well. Beer btw is hazy, white head, wheat, banana, yeast. Body is decent, carbonation is quite firm. 6-3-6-2-11.

It's clear this year! Lovely bright reddy brown body with a beige head that hung around. Caramel aroma and taste, so fairly sweet, some hop action calms it all down nicely though.

Greifenklau Laurenzi (Dunkles Kellerbier);Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Privater Brauereigasthof Greifenklau;Draught at Brauereigasthof Greifenklau in Nov., 2011: Yellowish orange. creamy and fluffy white head. Repelling nose of dirty malt and considerable huskiness (popcorn) with a hint of soap. Faint spicy hops. Soft carbonation leaves a foamy residue on the palate. Severely grainy with husky malts underlain with caramel-heavy, cookielike malt. Concrete-tainted yeastiness strongly exacerbates the astringent malt. Salty mineral is pleasant but little else to salvage drinkability. Hops are spicy and oily and lightly floral, though things continually lean toward sloppy and muddled as the body is quite worty and underattenuated. Closes dully and limply with ongoing concrete notes wreaking havoc. Very difficult to stomach...sloppy and amateurish.
Greifenklau Laurenzi (Dunkles Kellerbier);Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Privater Brauereigasthof Greifenklau;Draft. Poured into a ceramic mug with a thick off white head. Pale and sweetish malts, lighter earthy notes, and a sweet malty finish. Good, not great.
Maisel Eine Bamberger Weisse Dunkel;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Maisel Br�u Bamberg;Below average for the style. Plain light and not very spicy. A bit soapy. Oh I wish for so much more from this style, especially when I see one from Germany.

Maisel Eine Bamberger Weisse Dunkel;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Maisel Br�u Bamberg;1L ma�. Nice looking brown colored dunkelweizen, big frothy head bubbles down eventually. Fairly sweet aroma, appetizing. Taste is typical of the style , lots of banana, nuts, and a little yeasty. It fails to impress the palate, though - it�s a bit on the fizzy side, and it isn�t quite as smooth as it ought to be. Overall, not bad.
Maisel Eine Bamberger Weisse Dunkel;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Maisel Br�u Bamberg;"Brown coloured body with a thinnish tan head. Aroma of caramel malt, wheat, nuts and a little bit of spices. Medium-bodied; Strong malty flavours overtake the taste along with some nuts and raisiny-sweetness.

I sampled this beer from a 500 mL bottle purchased at RFD in Washington D.C. on 15 December 2006."
Maisel Eine Bamberger Weisse Dunkel;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Maisel Br�u Bamberg;[Bottle from Bamberg.] An ordinary dunkelweiss with the usually notes as banana, some bread, but could have some more ingredients in the flavor. Some watery, but OK!

Full Sail Equinox;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle listed as Equinox Brewmasters Reserve. Not sure what made it part of the Brewmasters Reserve, but I really didn�t think much of the beer overall. <br /><br /> An aroma dominated by a soapy character that was pretty overwhelming that it just stepped on anything else that the beer was trying to give. Oxidation in the flavor with some offset earthy hops and some old malt flavor. This just didn�t ring my bell at all, and usually Full Sail beers are pretty tasty.
Full Sail Equinox;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;A hazy amber ale with a thin off white head. A musty hops aroma, doughy, sowing signs of oxidation. In mouth, a good malt, with nuttyness, and sustained British hops bitterness, with grapefruit in final. Medium bodied. Brewmaster reserv 2006. Bought at Booze Bros, August 2007.
Full Sail Equinox;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Decent and drinkable, but not what I was looking for. This has a lot more fruitiness than I was expecting, with a really light caramel malt body, I just don�t feel the hop profile really matches everything else in the beer. Light sweet fruits, mixed with a sharp citrus hop bitterness.
Full Sail Equinox;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Hazy amber, moderate head with solid lacing and retention.

Full Sail Equinox;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bomber. Something like a caramel aroma backed by citrus hop. Hard to get a good smell, as the foam exceeds the liquid. Hazy gold tinged amber color. The head is huge, but it�s not lacing much. (It did lace a lot after the foam reduced 2/3s) Medium body with sharpish carbonation. Mild caramel with a bit of harsh floral and/or citrus hop. Pretty tasty. Waters out a bit at the finish, but it�s even more bitter at that point. Probably a bit extreme for most UK residents.
Full Sail Equinox;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Yeah! Tasted in 2000 and loved ever since! Poured a copper amber body with a thin white head. Good lacing. Sweet citrus presence. Malty as well with a sweet bite to it. Sessionable as sin.
Full Sail Equinox;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Had this beer on 8/27/1999. Color is a bright golden brown with good carbonation and a thin head. Aroma is a nice fresh hop scent. Taste is malty sweet, hoppy and oh so bitter. It starts with a medium body that has a bitterness in it right from the start. The finish starts as the beer goes down with a strong bitterness coming on and a light hop flavor.

Golden body leaning slightly towards amber with a lasting white head. Bready maltiness dominates the aroma, full, simple, effective. The taste is similarly under its sway, with some mild flowery and herbal notes being added along with a teeny tiny bitterness. A good lager by all means, but didn't thrill me as much as I hoped it would.

Is a black beer with a thick luscious tan head. Butter on the nose sits on top of a dry schwartz malt aroma that has cola, nuts, and asphalt. The palate is fine, not slick. The diacetyl is hardly detectable in the mouthfeel. The flavors are nice roasted malts and a dry nutty toasty roast. The butter burns off in both the flavors and the aromas, only lingering slightly.

Freist�dter M�rzen;Freistadt, Austria;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Braucommune Freistadt;getrunken im Sommer 2016 Die Braustadt Freistadt im M�hlviertel hat eine Besonderheit aufzuweisen, welche gerne im BWL-Unterricht durchgenommen wird: Eine Braucommune. Dies ist eine Art AG, an der jeder B�rger der Stadt automatisch einen Anteil hat, wenn er in einem gewissen Teil der Stadt wohnt. Wie das System genau funktioniert, wage ich nicht zu erkl�ren, nur soviel: Jeder Anteilseigner bekommt einen Teil Freibier. Das M�rzen ist das Standardbier der Brauerei, das auch in vielen Gasth�usern gezapft wird. Es ist ein typischer Vertreter des �sterreichischen M�rzens: Etwas herber und vollmundiger im Geschmack als das deutsche Pils, aber auch nicht so gehaltvoll wie viele Fest-M�rzen aus Bayern. Es l�sst sich gut trinken und stellt jeden zufrieden -man darf sich halt kein Spezialbier mit besonderen Aromen erwarten.

Again there is no real aroma to speak of. The taste is perhaps a bit smoother, and there is a bit of a caramel note here as well as a bit of currant. There is a hint of bitterness in the finish. I prefer this slightly to the draft version, but not by much. Regular Tap rating This beer is a full copper color and it is quite clear as well. The aroma is quite subtle and I can barely pick any components out. There are no real hop notes here. The beer is thin and crisp with subtle malt notes. I get some fruitiness with notes of strawberry and currants, a hint of apple as well. Again this is quite lame, though with no off flavors.

Some kind of dark fruit with currants (?). Different flavors here. Earth and very gentle bitterness. Chocolate is noted but it is under the grain and earth. This is easy drinking and generally sweet. Flavors are not big and it drinks easily.
R.J. Rockers Brown Eyed Squirrel;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;Poured from bottle. Aroma of caramel, malt and a tiny bit of hops. Appearance is solid brown, lacing head. Tasting roasted malt, burnt caramel, hops, butterscotch, veggies. Slightly sour on back. Pretty easy drinking, Not too carbonated. Overall, a decent, inoffensive brew.
R.J. Rockers Brown Eyed Squirrel;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;Shared 12 oz. bottle. Pours a cloudy amber with a minimal beige head. Aroma is mainly malty, with perhaps hints of dark fruits. Taste is sweet caramel malt and is also very nutty (maybe chestnuts) and bitter, to the point of being rather unpleasant. Disappointing.

Rockers Brewing Co.;"Aroma: simply malty with no other notes; Appearance: chocolate brown with no head -- at all; Taste: strong chocolate and malt, but not in a good way; somewhat watery with an odd tasting finish; Palate: medium body with little carbonation; Overall: not very pleasant; would not buy again."

Rockers Brewing Co.;This is a backlog rating from�2011 from a bottle, from�notes.�When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time.

R.J. Rockers Patriot Pale Ale;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;Slightly hazed light golden color. small, but stable off-white head. Aromas of grain, pale malt, and hints of floral to minty hops. Flavors follow the scents. Very bitter in the finish, mostly because of the lack of a malt backbone. 10/11
R.J. Rockers Patriot Pale Ale;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;12 ounce bottle poured into a brandy snifter. Pours a hazy copper color with a white head of foam that dissipates quickly. The aroma has stale cardboard papery character. It is overwhelmingly so. I can usually deal with some oxidation, but this is so bad I am tempted to pour it. The taste is sweet and herbal, but definitely stale. I don�t know how old this beer is, but it is definitely past its prime. Carbonation is moderate and the body is appropriate.
R.J. Rockers Patriot Pale Ale;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;Yellow gold color with a large, foamy white head. A bit of a sour citrus nose. Some bready malts and lightly toasted white bread with a bit of lemon and bitter orange peel in the finish. There is an odd tartness to this that may be intentional. Okay beer.
R.J. Rockers Patriot Pale Ale;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;Pours a dark golden hue with a very little white head. Aroma is rather malty with a hint of...vanilla? No, it�s caramel. I�m a huge caramel fan but this just odd. Very weird. Tastes very malty with a ton of caramel in the mouth with a bizarre Scottish vibe...which normally I would like. In this case, it kind of falls flat for me.
R.J. Rockers Patriot Pale Ale;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;12oz Bottle opened on 13th July 2014 and poured into stemmed Corsendonk badged tulip glass at my daughters place in Newport Beach, California. My first beer from this State, up to 30 now. Clear light amber body with carbonation bubbles rising to replenish the already deep off white head. No sediment left the bottle. Uncomplicated but far from dull, this packs a good hop punch in both the nose and taste: the malts being slightly understated and just below the surface, coming into their own towards the finish of each sip and getting more prominent as the beer warmed a little. Overall a very nice easy drink brew and a great find for me to add South Carolina onto my little list of US States ticks.

R.J. Rockers Patriot Pale Ale;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;"This is reviewed from notes as this was consumed during some time I spent in Delaware visiting for my brother�s wedding. This was served in a pint glass. The appearance was a fairly light amber color with a decent transparency about it. There was a nice one finger white foamy head that dissipated at a nice even pace. There was some adequate light lacing sticking finely to the sides of the glass. The smell were some bitter hops but coming across somewhat burnt as I couldn�t really tell if they were citrus, piney or fruity. The hops just seemed burnt. The taste well, that was pretty much the same. Hmmm....ok, well, uh...there�s a really fine watery aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sits fairly light and sessionable. The carbonation - what carbonation there isn�t any. Overall, hmmmm...do I want to say this one missed the mark? Hmmm....normally, I don�t like to be that guy, but uh...to quote Bob Uecker in Major League, this one�s ""just a bit outside."""
R.J. Rockers Patriot Pale Ale;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;Bottle pour of golden yellow with a fluffy off white head. Aroma of pine American hops and a big toasted caramel sweetness. Taste of huge bitter piney hops with the a slight sweetness. Med light body with bitter finish. Overall refreshing beer that is just too forward on the hops and out of balance to drink over and over. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
R.J. Rockers Patriot Pale Ale;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;12 oz bottle served in pint glass from tasting notes in Feb. 2011. Production(?) date of 10/13/2010. Small amount of sediment added mid-tasting. A - hazy light amber/gold with limited and short-lived white head that leaves little lacing despite carbonation level (medium+). S - pleasant piney hops with citrus notes and detectable caramel malt. T - good hop hit for an APA. Malt provides significant sweet balance for hops� bitterness. Downgraded for feel and for the flavor of the aftertaste.

R.J. Rockers Liberty Light;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;"Draught. Pours quite a light golden hue. Aroma? Is there one? There�s a weird candy sweetness in the watery flavor. This is thin even for a kolsch and not too clean. [November 6, 2010] Ordered a pint of this at Delaney�s Irish Pub in Spartanburg under the false impression that this was the ""Light Rock"" which is honestly probably the same beer anyway. Anyway, it�s not as bad as I recall. It�s not extra watery, but it is certainly tame. It pours a bit darker than macro lite beers would. The aroma is grainy with wimpy hops. Flavor is lightly tart with cereal and a gesture at papery hops. You just can�t win at the light beer game. This one has enough flavor for the style, but it�s not crisp or hoppy enough. It kind of reminds me of the corn flakes that fell out of the plastic bag and have been sitting at the bottom of the cereal box until you finally discover them after you thought you ate the whole bag."

[brewery note, my translation] *** Colour: Bright golden yellow, clear, with a big, frothy white head. *** Nose: Barley, a hint of vanilla, butter, straw. *** Texture: Medium body, not too watery, modest carbonation. *** Taste: Buttery opening, with clear barley malt, a hint of citrus, but surprisingly bitter considering the brewery�s own notes. Slightly increased bitterness even towards the middle, with hops and herbs over malted grain. Bitterness evaporates in the finish in favor of bready malts, some hops, and a wee bit of lemon. Aftertaste is grain, mild bitterness. *** Impressions: Refreshing and quaffable German lager in the ""Export"" style (i.e. maltier and with a slightly higher ABV than most Pilseners). Not bad for an ""industry brew"", a solid session beer."

Quarryman Saison Etrange;Berea, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Quarryman Taverne & Brewery;25 oz bottle: Medium amberish with a frothy off white head that lasts. Etrange would be a very good description of how this beer smells! There is a decent malty base to the aroma, but the spices used seem all muddled together with none being distinct. The peppercorns come through as it warms. It doesn't really have the barnyard aroma as typical with saisons, but it is definitely unique! Maybe even a little grassy hop aroma. The flavor is well balanced, but a little to the hoppy bitter side with some of the pepper coming through in immediate palate. The finish is hop flavored as is the aftertaste. Oddly enough, there's not a whole lot of complexity to this one in the flavor. Medium bodied with higher level of carbonation and lightly dry m/f. I'm not sure it it's the age of this beer that has taken away it's complexity, or if it didn't really have any to begin with. Then again, I'm not that big a fan of saisons.
Quarryman Saison Etrange;Berea, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Quarryman Taverne & Brewery;Thanks to Drew for tracking down a bottle of this for me. The bottle itself is beautiful with a yellow wax seal. It is also the first bottle of beer I have tried that employed both a bottle cap AND a cork. That is 3 layers of defense between me and a beer. The beer itself is a deep orange-amber color with a very thick and foamy bone white head. The lacing is very thick and sticky throughout. Lots of sweet fruit and allspice in the aroma. Medium-bodied, with an interesting fruit and spice flavor. Faint citrus throughout as well. There are also a lot of hops in the aftertaste. The finish is dry and tart. Although I am not all that familiar with the style, I enjoyed this one.
Quarryman Saison Etrange;Berea, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Quarryman Taverne & Brewery;One of Quarryman's rare bottled beers, this is an interesting saison. Deep orange/red cloudy body, big fluffy tan head that settled into a ring floating on top and leaving nice lacing. Bottle conditioned. Bottle was corked, capped, and covered with a thick layer of bright yellow wax. A sweet fruity aroma. Flavors were much more earthy, full of spices (coriander, I think, along with who knows what else) and some malty sweetness at the back. Dry finish. Palate was nice, but grainy - Maybe this could be aged awhile. Unique

I will stop into Bandana for a few of these every time I'm down in Mankato for a MoonDogs game!
Milwaukee Brewing Weiss;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Draft at the OF. Not 100% that this isn�t MBC Hefeweizen. Cloudy and unfiltered to style, minimal non head. Clovy sugary aroma, mild banana. Lots of banana in the flavor, almost overbearingly so. Low CO2, could have benefited from higher levels. The yeast really makes this beer, dominating the flavor profile. Mellow and unimpressive.
Milwaukee Brewing Weiss;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Dark orange, whitish cover. Aroma of orange, light spice, coriander. Taste is solid spiciness, estery, orange, citrus, nice wheat.
Milwaukee Brewing Weiss;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Milwaukee Brewing Company;On draft at MAH. From the sounds of things, this beer seems to be a bit different this year. It pours the traditional very hazy yellow-orange rather than the brownish color noted in previous reviews. Aroma is banana, cloves, some citrus, and a little grass. Flavor follows suit and is sweet and slightly spicy in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth with solid body. This is the most enjoyable beer I�ve had from MAH to date and I would say an above average hefe.
Milwaukee Brewing Weiss;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Milwaukee Brewing Company;I�m always on the search for a good American Hefe, this wasn�t it however. Pours a slightly clouded golden colour with a faint wheat aroma. Grainy on the palate, i was a little dissapointed in this brew.
Milwaukee Brewing Weiss;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Milwaukee Brewing Company;"Poured a very strange cloudy orangish brown. Smelled of ripe bananas (banana bread?) and some spices, particularly cloves. I also detected a hint of cinnamon in the nose. The flavor was really understated and didn�t have the chemical taste I always notice in hefes. This beer was smooth, fruity, and completely refreshing. Not a ""big"" beer by any means, but very good for its style."
Milwaukee Brewing Weiss;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Lovely hazed and dirty brown sugared banana colored with a white glacial oil lining the top. Aroma is just about perfect. Sweet cream, lactic sourness, buttery bananas on grahams getting soggier by the second. Sweet, aromatic vanilla almond wholesomeness abounds in the nose. Full flavored treat greets us with vanilla tootsie rolls plucked out of a sea of lemongrass roots. Distinctive grass stains hang on the end of each sip. Sweet cream and banana butter are livened by cackled white pepper and sugar crunched cloves. Lively flare pricks up the tongue top and sides while a chewy sorghum oat mentality plays out. Lively and nearly concrete as its tossed and sloshed around the mouth. Margarine crust of sourdough and a hint of blanched rye give a slight bite to the herbaceous herbal hop edge in the finish.
Milwaukee Brewing Weiss;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Draft. Hazy orange-amber body - no head. Fruity wheat malt, orange rind aroma.

Milwaukee Brewing Weiss;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Sampled last night at the MAH as the Session Ale. This beer is VERY much a non-filtered beer. It was an opaque yellow. VERY thick looking. Nice white head. The aroma was lemongrass, banana, light bubblegum, lemon. The flavor is wheaty, banana, lemon, buttery, sweet. This was pretty good for a wheat. The palate is pretty thick and rich. Given this was opaque, it had tons of wheat and/or yeast remnants...
Milwaukee Brewing Weiss;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Milwaukee Brewing Company;"Sample at the brewpub. Opaque extremely bright yellow, thick head. Typical �nana nose, more subtle than most. Bit salty on the tongue, and somewhat berry-charged. Meaty; fairly hoppy and light, bit pils-like at the end, little yeast. Seems atypical to me, but interesting and quite drinkable."
Milwaukee Brewing Weiss;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Milwaukee Brewing Company;A hazy light bodied weiss with recognizable banana notes and a soft smokey character in the finish. Clove is absent, but not missed. Bready and banana aftertaste lingers.

James Squire Australian Strong Ale;Sydney, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"OLD NOTES JUL 7, 2004 Finally found it. Pours rusty amber colour with a little white head. The aroma is quite weak, mainly nutty malt flavours and a bit of alcohol present. Quite a roasted flavour; dark chocolate, nut, caramel, stone fruits and a fair bit of alcohol. A different beer at different temperatures really. Very different from the others in the James Squire range, much more of a sipper and one for the winter, but has the quality you expect from other beers in the range from MSB."

James Squire Australian Strong Ale;Sydney, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Copper coloured body with a ruby tint and a thin off-white head. Aroma of caramel, malt, toffee, raisins and odd must. Medium-bodied; Sharp pungent maltiness with no sugars at all, fading fast to a musty & earthy finish. Aftertaste bitter, but remarkably clean! Overall, odd - hardly any character for what I�d normally expect, but great to try! Thanks so much to Phil (haddon90) for this one on his return trip down under.

James Squire Australian Strong Ale;Sydney, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle at Chris_O bottlefest 2007. Amber colour with thin beige head. Grapefruity aroma. Sticky toffee in mouth. Not that great to be honest. Fine if unsubtle.
James Squire Australian Strong Ale;Sydney, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A Mes rate: 345ml bottle (strange size) at Chris O�s extravaganza. Wheat, liquorice and malt in the aroma and a definite aged character to it. Dark blonde colour with only a slight white head. Flavour is similar to the nose, again with the aged feel but this time with some hops to add balance. Great creamy palate which again suggests some age. Interesting but not outstanding.
James Squire Australian Strong Ale;Sydney, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottled at Chris_O Fest March 2007. A copper coloured beer.

James Squire Australian Strong Ale;Sydney, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A deep rich amber color that looks and smells bloody brilliant in a sweet honey-malty kind of way, nice head too. Smells very fruity, and has a slight toffee kind of taste to it. I dont know if this would be considered an aggresive taste, but it kind of hits you hard. Though perhaps that is from teh high alcohol content (6.8%). Prefered the Porter from these guys, but Id buy again when Im in the mood for a drink that really registers.

Dragonmead Inquisition Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;IPA;Dragonmead Brewery;This is a backlog rating from�2011 on draft at the source, from�notes.�When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are pale and sweet malts, light earthy, doesn't drink like an IPA.
Dragonmead Inquisition Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;IPA;Dragonmead Brewery;Keg @ Dragonmead. Amber pour with a small head. Mellow caramel malt. A touch of brioche. Sugared biscuit. Earthy hop character. Drinks fairly well balanced. Slightly chewy. Soft carb.
Dragonmead Inquisition Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;IPA;Dragonmead Brewery;Sampled from the tap at the brewery. Pours a clear gold with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has grass and light earthy pine with some grains backing. Flavor has grass and grains with a bit of bread backing.
Dragonmead Inquisition Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;IPA;Dragonmead Brewery;Very weak aroma for an IPA, somewhat floral. Everything else was generally OK, nothing stands out. This is probably Dragonmead�s weakest IPA. Barely an IPA.
Dragonmead Inquisition Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;IPA;Dragonmead Brewery;"This was our waiter�s favorite so he gave us a good ""sample"" of it. Subtle for an IPA, so if you like a hoppy flavor without being overwhelmed by hops, this is the IPA for you. With that said, an IPA that is not very hoppy isn�t much of an IPA. Not bad, though."
Dragonmead Inquisition Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;IPA;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Pours a clear orange with a white head. Aroma of citrus, sweaty hops, and buttery popcorn. Flavor is rather sugary with sweet malt and some citrus and diacetyl, caramel malt. Meh, weak palate and pretty bland for an IPA. 6/4/6/3/12 [3.1/5]
Dragonmead Inquisition Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;IPA;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at the Dragonmead Brew Pub. Poured a medium amber color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas of floral hops and citrus. Tastes of the same floralness with citrus. Lighter sweetness with a lighter to medium bitter finish.
Dragonmead Inquisition Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;IPA;Dragonmead Brewery;2008 MiBGF: Golden hue with a small head. The aroma has notes of grassy and herbal hops with a biscuity vapour. The taste is twangy and bitter, nicely balanced with the malt, Slightly hop spiced towards the finish. The mouth feel is lively and refreshing. Not too shabby, would like to see on a hand pull real ale.
Dragonmead Inquisition Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;IPA;Dragonmead Brewery;On tap at Reno�s West, Lansing. Pretty standard offering, similar to several of Dragonmead�s other hoppy beers, but with less malt emphasis, instead focusing on the grassy, medicinal hops. Light-bodied and smooth.
Dragonmead Inquisition Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;IPA;Dragonmead Brewery;Draft at Ashleys. Poured clear copper color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate sour citrus aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet bitter flavor with a medium balanced bitter finish of long duration.
Camo Silver Ice High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;It smells like a homeless person, honestly it does. The taste is very strong but after you start sipping you ge get used to the taste. 40oz 3 bucks drop like 20 and you have a goodnight.
Camo Silver Ice High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;"24 ounce can into lager glass, no can dating. 0170 1459 can code. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense/creamy head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit too fruity corn aromas, but not overwhelming. Okay aromas with pale malt/corn and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, woody, floral, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of lemon, cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Nicely clean lager flavors; not overly fruity/yeasty. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and spicy alcohol. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a creamy/bready/grainy, and fairly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is good. A tad rough, but smooth to sip on. Mild increasing warmth of 10.6%, with minimal lingering booze after the finish. Overall this is a solid high gravity malt liquor. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; smooth, easy, and fairly crisp to sip on slowly with the mellowly bitter/spicy/drying finish. Nicely clean/rich pils malt/grain showcase, with nice earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Not overwhelming on adjuncts. Not quite the jet fuel I expected, it is quite drinkable. A fairly enjoyable offering for what it was."
Camo Silver Ice High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;Okay, so I was in the Navy and I can DRINK. That being said, after I got out, the bars every night just aren�t an option anymore. Enter the Camo Silver Ice 40oz at 10.6 percent. This isn�t a staple where I�m from (Atlanta) but having moved to the Pacific Northwest it�s available at the closest corner store for a full 3.00 dollars with tax. As for how to drink this, I�ll tell you straight up I�m not sure if I�ve ever swigged this poison. That being said, if you own a funnel, want to get buzzed
Camo Silver Ice High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;"Aroma - very old watered down sherry vinegar, cork, and spiced hops. Appearance - body is pale yellow, clean, and ok nucleation. The head starts at 2"" and disappears very quickly. Taste - sweet malt with flavors that come off as apple, rice, other fruits cardboard. Some very old sherry vinegar that has sat in the back of the cabinet for years, and now has a greatly reduced, but unpleasant taste. There is some spiced hops. Palate - on the lighter side, carbonation is average, the finish is alcohol and has a nasal cavity passage burn similar to old vinegar."

Camo Silver Ice High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;40oz bottle, in my dining room, just now. This looks like a perfectly nice beer... enjoyable golden color, big fluffy white head... lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma of sweet corn absolutely wafts from my glass. Gettin� the nose in there really brings out some of the alcohol, some grain, and a little bit of fruitiness. The flavor is surpassingly less rough than the aroma. Yes, there is a considerable alcohol hotness but it doesn�t come off as horribly rough. It�s lightly metallic and has a good grape character. There is a lot of sweetness happening here. It�s corny... but not as corny as the aroma would have had me believe. It�s a pretty passable high-gravity malt... but I don�t know if I�ll be taking down the whole 40.
Camo Silver Ice High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;40 oz. bottle. Pours a medium, short lived head, over a fizzy yellow (SRM 3) body......nose is raw egg white, apple, sugar, corn, alcohol, no esters.....taste is sweet, with corn, candy, apple, pear, hints of grape bubblegum,no hops or malts, no esters....mouth feel, light body, high alcohol burn, fizzy carbonation. this is a high alcohol sugar bomb. with minimal input from the usual beer, malts and hops, ingredients. The purpose of the yeast is to contribute alcohol and perhaps carbonation, but most assuredly no esters, phenols or other characteristics of a beer. It is not infected. BJCP 3/2/3/3/5
Camo Silver Ice High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;Smell of apples, corn, hay, strawberries, alcohol, malt. Taste is same, smooth but also alcohol. You don�t taste the alcohol as much as I feared, but it is there and does burn. Strong fusel influence, kinda tastes old and there was sediment on the bottom so my guess was mine had been sitting a while. Be careful to drink this slowly, as it�s like drinking two normal beers. I drank a 40 = bad idea
Camo Silver Ice High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;Maybe the worst malt liquor I have ever tasted. I was only able to drink a thimbles amount. Never again.
Camo Silver Ice High Gravity Lager;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;24oz can. Ouch. Cidery sweet, pale tan orange. Awful sweet, I wish this was just a bad cider, but oh so much worse as a beer.
Swinkels Brown Ale;Lieshout, Netherlands;Brown Ale;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Bright mahogany red/brown color. Rich creamy tan head. Interesting brown bread aroma with hints of orange peel and chocolate. Bittersweet roasted malt flavor with a lightly bitter aftertaste. Nice fruity overtones make for an interesting brew.
Swinkels Brown Ale;Lieshout, Netherlands;Brown Ale;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Reddish-brown, diminishing light tan head. Medium to light-bodied. Malty. Lots of caramel and fruit. Smells fruity. Very little bitterness or other hop flavor.
Felix Pils;Boezinge, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Leroy;Apart from their great oud bruin beers, Clarysse also produced this pale lager, taken over by Leroy when Clarysse stopped brewing in 2002. A gentle, genuine lager with pure pale malts, no disturbing corn or metal flavours, relatively rich and full taste at least for its style, with a nice floral hoppiness in the end. One of those old-fashioned regional �pilsbieren� which slightly transcend the big industrial average. Not sure if this is still made, though.
Felix Pils;Boezinge, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Leroy;One of the best Belgian pilseners. Golden coloured. Nice hoppy and spicy aroma with notes of caraway seeds. Refreshing.
Felix Pils;Boezinge, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Leroy;One of the better Belgian pilseners. Very hoppy and bitter..................
Watch City My O Maibock;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Watch City Brewing Co.;Art of Beer Festival 2004: Has an amber color and a small white head. Smell is sweet. Taste is of sweet malts and finishes slightly bitter. Overall a pretty good bock.
Watch City My O Maibock;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Watch City Brewing Co.;Pours golden brown. My notes are a little hazy (as was I at this point of the fest). This is a solid, mostly true to style bock, malty with a dry finish. Didn�t quite hold up to some bigger bodied American bock cousins, but good nonetheless.
Watch City My O Maibock;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Watch City Brewing Co.;Pour is a medium amber, with small white head, small bits of lace cling to the glass. Aroma is sweet, malty, and mild hops in the background. Flavor is sweet to start (honey, caramel), middle had a bit of tanginess to it (reminded me somewhat of banana, but with a slightly off flavor to them), ends with some hoppiness. Medium-full body, drinks very easy for the 7.4%.
Southampton Berliner Weisse;Southampton, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Southampton Publick House;Sat on this for a long time and opened it for new year�s among some friends during a great bottle share. 2009 ~ Holding up very well. If cellared correctly it�s a prime example of the style and what a bit of age can do for it. Huge pillowy white head with a mildly funky nose. Taste was lemon, wheat and light tartness that lingered. Much more flavor than expected. One of those bottles where I wish I had access to more.
Southampton Berliner Weisse;Southampton, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Southampton Publick House;Bottle at Damico�s. Pours cloudy pale yellow,with some head that lingers, nose is slight white vinous funk with citric acid, first sip is similar finish is mild tartness.

Southampton Berliner Weisse;Southampton, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Southampton Publick House;Hazy pale yellow. Rather lame and lime-like aroma with mild yeast and acidity. Watery but still quite refreshing mild taste without anything really popping. Dry semi tart ending with too clean yeast notes and too mild, unfresh acidity struggling too make an impression but never really getting there..
Southampton Berliner Weisse;Southampton, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Southampton Publick House;Bottle number 4 of 150 (2009 batch) along side 2011 batch generously shared by Maltzilla at the pre-Huny tasting. Clear pale yellow pour. Sour aromas. Both were tart and sour with lots of layers. I think the consensus was the nose was better on the �11 vintage, but the �09 tasted better.
Southampton Berliner Weisse;Southampton, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Southampton Publick House;Tried the 2009 and 2011 next to each other. The 09 had a strange rotten vegetable aroma but the flavor was clean and overall the beer was still a winner as those aromatics were missing in the mouth. The latest batch was clean, tart, and refreshing. Quite good.
Southampton Berliner Weisse;Southampton, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Southampton Publick House;Bottle shared at Jasons. Poured a hazy yellow with a small white head. Aromas are wheat and lemon, with a bit of barnyard funk. Taste is lemon and orange citrus zest upfront, with some earthy minerality and a bready finish. Decent carbonation and nice palate cleanser. Berliner Bier schmeckt gut.
Southampton Berliner Weisse;Southampton, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Southampton Publick House;Bottle 44. Looks like unclear urine, no head. Smells like urine after eating asperagus. Bit dusty also. Tastes sour, fruity, fresh - but with a weird after taste. Light body.
Southampton Berliner Weisse;Southampton, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Southampton Publick House;Bomber poured a clear gold with a small lasting white head. Aromas of graininess, yeast, straw and light citrus. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a dry lightly tart finish. Flavors of graininess, yeast, lemon and light straw with a crisp dry lightly tart finish.
Southampton Berliner Weisse;Southampton, New York, United States;Berliner Weisse;Southampton Publick House;bottle shared at 5k tasting - Hazy, yellow white. Aroma is bretty, barnyard funk with a bit of bile. Taste is light and fruity, with a punchy sourness. Tart and tasty with an oaky finish.
Southampton Quadrupel;Southampton, New York, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Southampton Publick House;2001: Hazy dark amber. Sticky, patchy white tiny bubbled foam. Sherry accented aroma, honey, dried peaches, candied yam, alcohol-soaked bread, pumpkin, caramel, leather, spicy alcohol, toasted coconut, fruitcake, soil, white grape, and pineapple. Underlying metallic shades, phenols, earthy hops, dates, and melon seed. Gentle velvety carbonation. Semi chewy body. Insanely rich dose of candy sugar up front. Trailing flavors of candied yam, mild toffee, vague acidity, dates, toasted coconut, brown sugar, and a decadent, honeyed, raw maris otterlike base. Finishes richly malty, medicinal, cakey, and sugary with a light leathery, citric coarseness and subtle assorted dried tropical fruit backdrop. To call this rich and complex would be an understatement. The candy sugar elements were borderline offensive, and blanketed most of the subtleties. However, the mild acidity kept it from becoming cloying. Still, a satisfying dessert sipper fit for two, with that lovely signature Southampton bottle-conditioned feel.
Saint Arnould Vlimeuse;Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Microbrasserie Saint Arnould (Coop Brassicole des Laurentides);Tap at the brewery. Amber with a small white head. Aroma is malt. Medium body, soft carbonation. Taste is malt and alcohol.
Slater's Shining Knight;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Slater's Ales;Cask, Kings Head, Leicester. Golden amber with a lacy foam. Aromas are oranges and brown sugar with apple and leafy hops. Woody and yeasty with herbal notes and hints of toffee. Flavours are leafy herbal notes with sweet brown sugar and toffee. Spicy and floral with a peppery, liquorice finish. Apple with dusty yeast and a fruity bitter finish. Pretty goid.
Slater's Shining Knight;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Slater's Ales;Hand-pulled pint into a UK sleeve on 26 Apr 2013 in my local Wetherspoons. Dark amber, leaning towards mahogany in colour, clear with an un-even head of off-white scummy bubbles for a head. The aroma sends out a hop message, the taste however is malty: a bitter hop finish rounds off the flavours nicely, even if it is at odds with the rest on the drink. This is more complex than it appears and is different and almost strange in its make-up. I�ve had it before and don�t remember the mood swings in the taste, difficult to dislike, but I didn�t really enjoy it either.
Slater's Shining Knight;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Slater's Ales;Cask at the Cherry Tree, Catthorpe - 16/05/12. Clear amber, thin white head. Mild hop aroma - pretty boring. Fruit taste, dull malt flavour, medium bodied and generally zzzzz boring.
Slater's Shining Knight;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Slater's Ales;A Mes rate: Cask at the Old Market Tavern. Very bland very citric bitter. Slight malt just about adds balance but there really is nothing else to shout about.
Slater's Shining Knight;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Slater's Ales;(Cask at Market Porter, Borough, London, 30 July) Colour is amber with a short frothy head. Nose is malty with dark, dried fruit (prunes, dried apricots). Taste is malty and nutty with dried fruit (prunes, raisins), initially sweet but turns drier in a mildly hoppy finish. Well balanced and fairly ok.
Slater's Shining Knight;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Slater's Ales;Cask @ Market Porter, Borough, London. Rating #800. Pours a clear amber colour with small white head. Malty aroma with some hints of caramel. Malty fruity flavor with some hints of apples. Malty fruity aftertaste.
Slater's Shining Knight;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Slater's Ales;A dark amber brown beer with a very weak white head. A sweet biscuity malt nose, slightly yeasty, with hints of tropical fruits. The taste is dry biscuity malt, followed by a sweet tropical fruit flavour, again there is some yeastiness in the background. The finish is slightly cloying. (Cask - The Fox & Hounds, Heacham, Norfolk).
Slater's Shining Knight;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Slater's Ales;Cask Handpump at The Wellington, Birmingham. Copper, short foamy head. Malty scent, with some bitter hops. Hoppy in the mouth, but not as bitter as I had hoped. Slight fruitiness of oranges. Thick and creamy on the palate.
Slater's Shining Knight;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Slater's Ales;Cask@The Trafalgar, Greenwich. Lots of overipe estery fruit, with some lactic acidity. Not sure if the beer is meant to be like this or they didn�t look after it properly, somethings not right here.
Slater's Shining Knight;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Slater's Ales;Cask @ Trafalgar (Greenwich): Very fruity, harsh apricot. A little citric but unfortuantely not in good condition. Amber with a white head. Simple bitter, which I�m sure can be better.
Crouch Vale Fireball;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Crouch Vale Brewery;Cask @ Charlie�s Bar, Copenhagen. Hazy reddish golden colour with a small white head. Slightly fruity aroma with some hints of citrus and some hints of hoppiness. Fruity hoppy flavor with some hints of citrus. Long fruity hoppy aftertaste.
Crouch Vale Fireball;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Crouch Vale Brewery;A dark, reddish, copper coloured beer with a thickish white head. A light, malty nose to begin with, then a touch of citrus fruit comes through. The taste is bitter and dry, but malty, along with a slightly zesty citrus fruit flavour in the finish. (Cask - The Fox & Hounds, Heacham, Norfolk).
Crouch Vale Fireball;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Crouch Vale Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Borough Arms, Crewe 09/06/2005 Golden amber colour slightly dry and wheaty. Some bitterness in a malt finish.
Crouch Vale Fireball;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Crouch Vale Brewery;(On tap) Amber coloured, almost clear, no head. Fruity, floral nose from the hops. Rather light body. Lots of fruity flavours with a short, dry finish. 250605
Crouch Vale Fireball;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Crouch Vale Brewery;[Cask at Charlie�s Bar, Copenhagen] A hazy amber beer with a huge orange head. The aroma is sweet with hints of coriander combined with some oranges. The flavor is dry with notes of honey and caramel, combined with notes spices - especially coriander, leading to a dry bitter hoppy end.
Crouch Vale Fireball;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Crouch Vale Brewery;Cask. Copper colour, small white head. Very nice hop aroma, fresh and citrusy. Flavour is also nicely hopped, again with some citrus. Moldy aftertaste. Very nice pint.
Crouch Vale Fireball;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Crouch Vale Brewery;[Cask conditoned at Charlies Bar, Copenhagen] Amber coloured. Fruity and hoppy aroma and flavour. Still a little bit less hops than in your regular Crouch Vale bitter. It is still very smooth and nice with some bitterness in the finish.
Crouch Vale Fireball;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Crouch Vale Brewery;Amber colour - not red as claimed. I didn�t pick up too much in the aroma, but that may be because I had a heavy cold. Fairly malty for a Crouch Vale beer, although there is a moderate hop presence in there too. Dry and fresh, clean and crisp. Not the most assertive of Crouch Vale beers, but good enough. Cask (gravity dispense), Reading Beer Festival 2005.
Crouch Vale Fireball;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Crouch Vale Brewery;Cask@Reading BF. Orange/brown. A little bit cereally and nutty, slightly biscuity or something aswell. Some citric hop tang in the finish. Nice dry, medium bitter finish. Quite a nice best bitter.
Crouch Vale Fireball;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Crouch Vale Brewery;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Amber beer, hoppy smell, small cream head. Starts out with a nice tangy malt freshness, with a margin of hops. Gets smoother and less dramatic, as it warms, and ends up being an Ok Bitter.
Matt Private Mens Club Pilsner;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;The beer itself isn�t particularly remarkable - watery and pungent but far from the worst I�ve ever had. The most noteworthy aspect of this pilsener is the incredibly loud colors and rather disturbing art on the can. I walked right past a cop drinking this on the street and he didn�t even give me a second look as nobody would presume that the contents of such a ridiculous looking container could be alcoholic.
Matt Private Mens Club Pilsner;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Fantastic! Finally a beer I can enjoy in the finest of company! The company of Gentlemen, that is! Hear Ye Hear Ye! Nothing says ""kicks"" better than a billiard table, my closest and most private gentleman friends and a case of beer that tastes so awful you�ll forget how bad it smells.

Matt Private Mens Club Pilsner;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Private Men�s Club, or PMC, is a very cheap NY beer with excellent can art of an 1800s men�s club. and a blue can. It is nearly odorless and flavourless - The flavor that it does have, mixed with the fizzy artificial carbination, is akin to pool water, but still more drinkable and less offensive than some other extremely cheap beers - PMC doesn�t have a metalic can taste as far as I could tell, nor does the alcohol flavor cut through the beer, defects that truely deserve a sub-2 rating.
Matt Private Mens Club Pilsner;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"I also got cans of this stuff at a Kmart. This was flavorless and watery. It had a hint of sort of unidentifiable grain (corn?). Completely flat beer that had an ""infused"" taste of the aluminum can it was in; metallic and wierd tasting. I only bought it because it looked funny and tasted just as I expected... bad. Don�t waste your money on this."
Matt Private Mens Club Pilsner;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"If I could find a can of Matt Brewing's Utica Club beer, I imagine it would be a bit like this. This comes in blue cans that suffer from the worst artwork imaginable. You can buy this at KMart now, FYI. Despite the 3"" head when I poured it, this beer isn't all that fizzy and it's ever so slightly sweet. Totally devoid of flavor, this is your great-grandfather's beer circa 1920 (OK, that was during Prohibition, but you get the idea). Tastes of corn, not surprisingly."
Cheshire Cat Red Ale;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;Light brown and clear. Medium carbonation with watery notes throughout. Hardly any sweetness to speak of. Bit of a nuttiness to it. Smoky and bitter at times. Couldn't find any of the Red Ale qualities I look for in a Red Ale.
Cheshire Cat Bock is Back;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;"Clear, deep amber. Big and richly sweet; sort of candy-like and sugary. Some fruity notes surface here and there, along with some alcoholic notes."
Cheshire Cat Bock is Back;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;Draught. Dark amber. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted light bread, caramel), lightly hoppy (flowers), with a note of peach. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter, lightly acidic. Finish is moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. I wouldn't call this a bock by any stretch, it's more of an American interpretation of a maerzen/Oktoberfest, but it's not bad either way.
Cheshire Cat Black Cat Stout;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;on tap-pours a ? head and black color with red tint. Aroma is dark malt-roasty/molasses. Taste is dark malt-coffee/roasty/molasses, secondary dark fruit, hops. Not my style.
Cheshire Cat Black Cat Stout;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;On tap at the Cheshire Cat Brew Pub. Poured a dark brown color with red edges and a small sized off white head. Aromas of roast and light chocolate. Tastes of chocolate, roast, light vanilla, and a little smokey. Thinner for a stout.

Cheshire Cat Black Cat Stout;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;Dark black with a creamy brown head. Roasty with a big smoky note. Medium bitterness seems to balance it out somewhat. One of the better Cheshires I've had.
Cheshire Cat Dunkelweizen;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;Odd color -- hint of haze within a light brown shade. Lively carbonation. Some watery notes. Sweet malts were dryish and bread-like. Only a hint of bitterness. Not enough sweetness or roast by any means.
Big Horn Big Daddys Bourbon Brown Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);"This beer pours a deep brown with a thin off white head. The aromas are sewerage, really! really not appealing on the nose. the flavor is not good; its like the beer was infected by bacteria but not like a sour, its not good. It�s got a sticky mouthfeel and lively carbonation with a slight dryness. not a good beer at all. Cheers!"
Big Horn Big Daddys Bourbon Brown Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);"Draught No head, dark brown indeed. Very obvious whisky - sorry, Bourbon - nose; vinous and liqueurish; dark malts also, but strictly nothing else. Quite sweet taste, only strengthened by the alcohol. Alcohol, fortified, pungent, near adstringent MF. Unidimensional, even after the barrel aging, this is essentialy an uninteresting beer."
Big Horn Big Daddys Bourbon Brown Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);(Draught) Poured a dark brown with a medium large-bubbled head. Very unique taste with similarities to Samuel Smith beers. Had a hint of vanilla, oak, and bourboun.
Big Horn Big Daddys Bourbon Brown Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Pretty damn tasty. Incredibly creamy and luscious, a dark and rich brown ale. Lots of different tastes coming out in this one, from cinnamon, to vanilla. Nicely complex and balanced, what I like to call a double brown ale. Extremely tasty and unique!
Big Horn Big Daddys Bourbon Brown Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);"At the Indiana MBG Fest: Brewed in Indy, a GABF winner in 2001 for cask conditioned. This beer is different from the others such that it is aged in Woodford Reserve cask for 2 months, is about 6% ABV, and is named Big Bad Bourbon Brown Ale (gotta love the name!) The brewmaster is John Handley who now works in Colorado. On to the rating: Very dark brown with a nice oily rim, good clear ""tears"". The aroma was beautiful, very bourbon and vinous. Hints of roasted malts, cherry, prune, oak wood, leather and vanilla. Wonderful sweet and tart taste, complex. Earthy yet has a fresh hoppy characteristic for an aged ale. The brew is full-bodied with a oily and chewy mouthfeel. I may be the only person at RateBeer to get to enjoy this version of Indy's Big Horn aged brown since the new brewmaster, Dave, has no plans to attempt this again. All you Indiana members don't know what you missed. Oh by the way, this is my #500 rating! Roll Out The Barrel!!"
Big Horn Big Daddys Bourbon Brown Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Interesting brew. The bartender told me it was aged in barrels that contained Jack Daniels. I can taste the Jack. Underneath the bourbon flavor is a somewhat malty brown ale that somehow manages not to be cloying. I was expecting this to be too sweet but it was rather well-balanced and was an interesting combination of flavors. Gets points for being unique.
Big Horn Big Daddys Bourbon Brown Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Finally, a worthy brew from this brewpub (Dallas.) Muted bourbon aroma. Light rootbeer brown. Good bourbon barrel flavor on top of a tart, chocolatey brown ale. Tartish finish. Session-style mouthfeel. My favorite beer from this brewer so far, but I suspect that it gave me a pounding headache, like bourbon does.
Il Bovaro Axel;Firenze, Italy;Bock - Doppelbock;Il Bovaro Birreria Artigianale;Quite a interesting brew, very complex things going on here. Poured a hazy dark amber with little head. Aroma was of basement, vinegar, vinous, and plums. Tastes of leather, smoke, plums, and grapes. The taste was a nice surprise, since I really didn�t detect the leather and smoke in the smell. Had a light dry body with low carbonation and some tartness near the end.
Il Bovaro Axel;Firenze, Italy;Bock - Doppelbock;Il Bovaro Birreria Artigianale;One I would have really enjoyed to have fresh and on tap. Great smelling hazy copper, capped off with a light head. Sour plums, wheat, leather and sweet raisins enticed the nose. There was a surprising smokiness in the flavour as well as some white wine, caramel, cinnamon and light tartness. Low carbonation and a thin body here, this brew would have been rated higher had it had a little more chew and zazz.
Il Bovaro Axel;Firenze, Italy;Bock - Doppelbock;Il Bovaro Birreria Artigianale;From tap at the brewpub. Pours hazy orange with a small white head. Aroma is toasted malty and caramelish. Light bitter. Fruity, sweet and light caramelish. Bitter and medium dry finish.
Il Bovaro Axel;Firenze, Italy;Bock - Doppelbock;Il Bovaro Birreria Artigianale;Draught at Il Bovaro, Florence. Murky amber with medium tanned head. Syrupy caramel on the nose and not really anything else. The flavour is caramel syrup - tastes kinda like an alcoholic caramel milkshape. Bizarre. Syrupy mouthfeel. Boozy and ultra sweet cloying finish. Terrible beer.
Il Bovaro Axel;Firenze, Italy;Bock - Doppelbock;Il Bovaro Birreria Artigianale;Dark brown color. Thin palate. Some caramel and a little red meat. I wish I had more to say, but really, there was not much effort here.
Il Bovaro Axel;Firenze, Italy;Bock - Doppelbock;Il Bovaro Birreria Artigianale;On tap at the brewpub. Cloudy copper with a rich yellowish head. fruity aroma. Good toffee and fruit flavours. Body is on the light side. decent.
Il Bovaro Axel;Firenze, Italy;Bock - Doppelbock;Il Bovaro Birreria Artigianale;Cloudy chestnut coloured. Thin white head. Quite soapy in the nose, fruity and slightly tart. Not the cleanest lines I suspect and it would not be very surprising from this brewpub. Fruity orientations take strawberry and blueberry inclinations. Limited complexity, feeling kinda synthetic and aromatised outside brewing. Besides, a waxiness overpowers the darker malt profile. Insufficient carbonation also enhances the sweetness while the body is thin and dead. Soapiness remains strong throughout and with the body�s frailty, the dish water association is quickly made.
Il Bovaro Axel;Firenze, Italy;Bock - Doppelbock;Il Bovaro Birreria Artigianale;Doppio Malto Red color. Strong fudge aroma. Caramel and fudge taste. Ordinary palate.
Birrificio Torino Gina;Torino, Italy;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Birrificio Torino;Hazy blond color. Nice spicy aroma. Weaker body, with some good but light malt taste, also here the infusion has been a bit too long.

Oliver Blonde Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oliver Brewing Co.;Pours a half finger of head on a hazy light straw body. The aroma is mild honey.

Oliver Blonde Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oliver Brewing Co.;With Tim. On tap at Pratt Street Ale House. Light, smooth feel, malty taste. Nothing too exciting.
Oliver Blonde Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oliver Brewing Co.;"Tap. Pours clear yellow with average, creamy white head; good retention and spare lacing. Aroma is straw malt, grassy hops, floral notes, lemon, oranges, and faint funk. Flavor is light, grainy malts forward with light fruit esters and faint hops towards the finish; dry finish.

DuClaw Deception;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;DuClaw Brewing Company;1 liter swingtop. I think this came from slob. Pours amber with no discernable head to speak of. Touches of white bubbles on the surface, but that�s about it. Smells very citrussy and of dry malt (more of an over the top tripel). Tastes sweet with lots of spicey characteristics and some earthiness on this finish. An interesting take on this style. Alcohol is at the forefront of this beer unfortunately, but the flavors underneath have blended together nicely in this one.
DuClaw Deception;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;DuClaw Brewing Company;1 liter bottle, from my cellar. It�s aged for 4 years now. Sealed with black wax. Poured out a clear amber color,with a minimal head. More a ring of fine bubbles around the rim of the glass than a real head. Aromas are of citrus peel, yeasty bread, clover honey. Flavors are of citrus peel, some fruitiness, and plenty of alcohol. Hops are long gone on this beer. No hop aromas or much in the way of flavors either. More of a mead at this point than a beer. Thick mouthfeel, thinned by excessive alcohol. Burning in the throat, yet smooth on the tongue. This beast still needs some more age on it.
DuClaw Deception;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;DuClaw Brewing Company;A pretty pale gold with a small slightly off white head. Overwelmingly sweet. You can taste the alcohol, but it is burried under the syrup that covers up all the other flavors. Not bad, but I had to stop at one. And not because of the alcohol content.
DuClaw Deception;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;DuClaw Brewing Company;A limited release in July 2004, that still needs time to develop. Right now, it�s a one trick pony: sweet. From the nose to the palate and on through to the finish, the sweetness just totally dominated. Small head accompanied the hazy, orange appearance. I spilled some on my fingers and sugar crystals welded them to the glass. Will they give us another chance in a couple of years?
DuClaw Deception;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;DuClaw Brewing Company;Deep hazy gold, lasting off white head. Nose on this rocket fuel is all about the sweets with belgian candi sugar, orange blossom honey, and sweet doughy caramel malt. Thank god I have a sweet tooth! :-) Blast of sweet alcohol gets combined with fuzzy fruit and flowers in the flavors. Full bodied, syrupy, soft sweet candi sugar finish. Still needs cellar time, but great stuff none the less!
DuClaw Deception;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;DuClaw Brewing Company;Peachy gold. Sweet and spicy nose. Huge fruity blast at first taste, but gets a syrupy character that gets a mite cloying.
DuClaw Deception;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;DuClaw Brewing Company;Same bottle as argo0 and egajdzis. Hazy golden amber color. Small off-white head. Very sweet and spicy aroma. Alcohol is quite noticeable. Flavor is sweet and flowery. Too many unfermented sugars, but it has potential. Needs more aging, IMO. Body is syrupy and coats the palate.
DuClaw Deception;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;DuClaw Brewing Company;Sampled from the same bottle as argo... Poured a hazy golden color with a white head and nice lacing. Sweet aroma of candy and alcohol. And overall the taste included sugar, with some alcohol burn on the tongue.
DuClaw Deception;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;DuClaw Brewing Company;(8 mos. old) Small white head atop clear hazy body. Aroma is very sweet (candy sugar, honey), peach, flowery. Taste is painfully honey sweet, with fairly strong alcohol. Full body.
DuClaw Deception;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;DuClaw Brewing Company;Thick white head. Yeasty aroma. Nice lacing. Flavor is sweet and full. Candy sugar sweetness is just about out of control. Sugar overdose imminent! Alcohol flavor on finish but not overpowering considering the ABV.
Real Rock Light;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big City Brewing Company;I saw this on tap at my resort in Jamaica next to the Real Rock Lager, so I figured I should try it. The beer was fairly similar in colour to Real Rock, but with a slightly more pale hue. The smell was also a little more subtle, but pretty fragrant for a 'light' beer. The taste was also pretty good for a light, but a little less strong than the normal Real Rock. A good example of a light beer, and a pretty good example of a lager in general! I found this at my resort in Montego Bay, Jamaica -- the Wyndham Rose Hall.
Dragonmead Armageddon Grand Cru;Warren, Michigan, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Dragonmead Brewery;Pours clearish amber with a minimal ivory head. Aroma presents strong sweet fruity, honey and fresh malt notes. Flavor features honey, tropical, pomme, stone fruit and fresh malt - yet it could just about pass for a mead. Texture yields OK body and perky fizz. Will blow you away.
Dragonmead Armageddon Grand Cru;Warren, Michigan, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Dragonmead Brewery;Tap, Mani, Ann Arbor, MI. Deep gold, slight haze. Balanced aroma, sweet honey with banana. Syrupy first sip. Mellow with sweet banana and passion fruit. Slightly too sweet on the finish but still nice.
Dragonmead Armageddon Grand Cru;Warren, Michigan, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Dragonmead Brewery;Draft pour. The beer is a clear amber aith a thin head that dissipates quickly. Strong oaky character with a bit of burning alcohol and toffee. Big sweetness. A little boozy. The strength of the alcohol is a bit much for me.
Dragonmead Armageddon Grand Cru;Warren, Michigan, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Dragonmead Brewery;Bottle shared, thanks Gregg. Rich sweet caramel character with a candy edge, fairly boozy. Slightly disappointing one, may have been aged past its prime.
Dragonmead Armageddon Grand Cru;Warren, Michigan, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Dragonmead Brewery;Thanks to Greg for sharing the bottle! Aged for about 3+ years. Poured into a taster showing ruby amber with a finger of tanned foam. The nose shows a caramel forwardness with light hints of raw meat (?). The palate is light bodied and lightly carbonated. Belgian yeast forward with a strong tea like sweetness.
Dragonmead Armageddon Grand Cru;Warren, Michigan, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Dragonmead Brewery;Bottle shared at Ratebeer Tokyo W & CB Tasting. Thanks Gregg P! Honey, caramel malts, toffee and rum raisin bread on the nose with some light cinnamon and booziness present. Body is thin and sweet, but still nice enough.
Dragonmead Armageddon Grand Cru;Warren, Michigan, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Dragonmead Brewery;Light brown color. Lots of plum and bread nose. Big malty very drinkable. Fallen off a bit.
Dragonmead Armageddon Grand Cru;Warren, Michigan, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Dragonmead Brewery;750mL bottle, pours a clear amber with a small beige head. Aroma is authentic, with Belgian yeast, caramel, dark fruits and candied sugar. Flavour brings out spiced Belgian yeast, candied sugar and caramel. Not overly complex, with a spicy, sweet finish. Not bad.
Dragonmead Armageddon Grand Cru;Warren, Michigan, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Dragonmead Brewery;Bottle - Caramel and spice with some umame. Clear caramel with no head. Caramel, light booze, sweet honey and stone fruity yeast. Not as interesting as I hoped.
Dragonmead Armageddon Grand Cru;Warren, Michigan, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Dragonmead Brewery;"750 ml bottle into chalice, 2014 vintage bottling. Pours fairly crystal clear orange/copper color with a thin off white head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace. Minimal lacing on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, pear, apple, light banana, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, pear, apple, light banana, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, pear, apple, light banana, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, candi sugar, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly slick, and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent quadrupel style! All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

Mallard Duck 'N' Dive;Maythorne, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mallard Brewery;Cask at The Cross Keys, Byard Lane, Nottingham. Golden yellow and clear. Decent creamy head with good lacing effect. Aroma wasn�t noticeable.

South Street JP Ale;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;South Street Brewery;"On tap at brewpub A standard pale ale, this draft at least offers some regional flair that makes it the best fallback on pint night. If sessionable hop driven beers tickle your fancy then grab one with dinner. Even if you don�t it makes a good benchmark for their better releases to help prepare the palate. Aroma / Appearance - A caramel bronze body glimmers below head that looks like fresh layers of frosting. Malt and wheat sweep to a woody impression that dissipates quickly. Flavor / Palate - The fluid body might be a little tame. Even so it generates interest with wave after wave of gentle hops and pine. It feels a bit like someone on the East Coast read about West Coast hop driven beer then tried to make a clone. Mostly it gets the job done without much fuss; you just won�t be trading anything special to get your taste."

Roppelt Kellerbier;Hallerndorf-Stiebarlimbach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Roppelt;Multiple Seidla at Roppeltkeller, Frankenkellertour 2018. - - Another incremental notch on the Franconian mystery scale of infinite lager sessionability: not the most aromatic nor rustic, but subtly malty (non-fruity bread dough), subtly earthy and healthily herbal-hopbitter Kellerbier with a subdued mineral streak. Just like Lieberth's and it appears as a trademark of Hallerndorf tastes, quenching and enlivening in its finishing herbal bitterness (grasses, meadow leaves, touch of green tea). - I prefer slightly darker, (cara-)maltier, more adventurous Kellerbiere, but it's hard to argue with 1,5Liters of Seidla perfection on a hot day.

Fresh marzipan bread and vanilla hay aroma, springtime pasture. Natural barley lemonade with rounded curves&edges, little barley ""beer flavour"" - a trait Innoticed in their Hopfenstoff as well. Very easy drinking, an allround lovely beer. - - What is wrong with RB people? - apart from Moravius and a few discerning Italian Frankenlovers, people have logged this gem of a light Kellerbier & their own ratings into passing oblivion. May be that batches vary and freshness is an issue, but tasting beers at the source and bottled, Prechtel's output seems legit and unique in their 4,2-4,5% lager range. - Of note: Prechtel still uses a #K�hlschiff and mechanic transmission belts."

Henry Weinhards Amber Light;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle... tasted more like a Golden Ale to me, light hop character and very sweet, not very intricate, but I feel like it was trying to be. Just not quite the hardiness I look for in a beer. Decent for a cheap macro, but would rather skip this one.
Henry Weinhards Amber Light;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Poured a nice medium amber color with a small head. Tasted of malts, caramels, and traces of citrus. Very light, faint flavor. Not much of a kick in this beer.
Henry Weinhards Amber Light;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Pours a nice medium amber color. Aromas of caramel, malt, and a touch of hops. Flavor is smooth malt with a little bitter in the finish. Great beer for the price.
Henry Weinhards Amber Light;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;A good light amber beer,. Not much body but had some taste. They mised on some key areas like a roasted malt that could add to the flavor. I wish they could slow down and actually ferment longer than 3 days so they can get some added flavors .
Henry Weinhards Amber Light;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Caught a 12-pk on sale at WinCo for 6.78. Not my favorite by anymeans, though I prefer it over Henry�s Private. Where did the porter and blackberry wheat go? Very white soapy head. Nice amber color. Drinks just fine for what it is. I�d only buy it for this price while wanting to cut calories. By far better than any BMC offering.
Henry Weinhards Amber Light;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Well, hopefully I consumed less calories by drinking this. Very light in everyway... flavor, aroma, and just the overall presense are pretty limited.
Henry Weinhards Amber Light;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Amber with hints of ruby. Large off white head and some lacing. Caramel, some malts and citrus hops in the nose. Citrus and peppery hops dominate the flavors. Malts back this up with mostly caramel. There is a slight sweetness to it, but not much. The palate is thin and a little touch of spice to it. The finish is of caramel and citrus.
Henry Weinhards Amber Light;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Pellucid, bronze, creamy full bodied thick head with perfect formation that lasts and gives a little lacing. The aroma is lightly malty, a touch of caramelt and toffee with a faint hint of citrusy hops. The flavor is way off balanced though, it tastes a little off sweet like fresh wort with an aged off bitterness. Finishes acidicly with a light and metallic body. The taste and finish were the downfalls here, but the aroma was decent, just very faint.

Angelic Enchanted Abbey;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Angelic Brewing Company;Hazy dark amber body. Heavy, sweet flavor. Has figs, chocolate milk, and maple wood. More heavy on the fig sweetness than other Abt. styles (has the same woodiness as a Westy, just not as pronounced). Dry flavor overall. Light alcohol and dark bread in the weak aroma. Good mouthfeel for the style.
Angelic Enchanted Abbey;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Angelic Brewing Company;"Glass at the brewpub.

Mallard D.A.;Maythorne, Nottinghamshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Mallard Brewery;Cask (gravity) at the Melton Mowbray CAMRA festival 2005. Been chasing this for sometime and it was worth the wait. Deep brown body, flavour like a subtle versionof those chocolate covered Scottish berries, sustained finish. Wish I could get this beer on a regular basis.
Mallard D.A.;Maythorne, Nottinghamshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Mallard Brewery;Bottle conditioned. Deep, dark chestnut colour, good off white head and good soft condition. Big chocolate powder aromas mingled with fruit notes. In the mouth the carbonation at first threatens to dominate but miraculously dissolves leaving chocolate flavours that seem to morph into coconut as it passes over your tongue and into the throat. Finish is fruity and long, with a roast barley dryness developing. At no point does the strength of the beer become apparent.
Crouch Vale Brewers Gold Extra;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Crouch Vale Brewery;Tasted from can. Pours a hazy gold with thick white head. Citrus aroma. Moderately sweet with mild bitterness. Flavors of grains, hay, caramel, faint tropical fruit flavors. You think you'll be tasting an IPA and then get surprised by the low to no bitterness but very good for a blond ale. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Crouch Vale Brewers Gold Extra;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Crouch Vale Brewery;500ml bottle, drinking this a few hours after Brewers Gold to compare. Clear pale golden colour with a small white head. Aroma: fruity, hoppy, malty, slightly odd apple cider like aroma. Taste: fruits, malts, citrus, herbal, initially sweet with quite a bitter finish for the style. Medium body and carbonation, smooth mouthfeel. Expected a more intense Brewers Gold, got something very different, not entirely sure this is how it was supposed to taste. First person to review this in 10 years so I suspect it may have changed a bit.
Crouch Vale Brewers Gold Extra;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Crouch Vale Brewery;on cask at 3 judges, glasgow. golden with a faint haze and modest white head. promisingly prickly hop aroma, smooth texture, quite crisp with hints of ripe apple. slightly medicinal, minty character, pretty bitter, perhaps it wasn�t in optimum condition but still a good drop
Crouch Vale Brewers Gold Extra;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Crouch Vale Brewery;Cask at the 3 judges in Glasgow. Minimal haze obstructs the light golden hue. Flowery and kinda perfumey, rather funky hops with a wild side. Not too grainy in maltiness, but slightly nondescript, letting most of the place to the hops. Fresh flavoured, bright and pretty aromatic. Limited minerals despite the light salty touch. Mellow melon undertones introduce the sandy, evolving bitterness. Tannic upon the finish that is bready and long-lasting. Good indeed, if not my favourite golden ale.
Crouch Vale Brewers Gold Extra;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Crouch Vale Brewery;Cask at Black Door, Helsinki. Golden color. Sweet, malty and honeyish aroma with citrusy hops. Firm citrusy and herbal hop flavor with sturdy bitterness. Some raisiny notes. Tastes a bit like hops mixed water, this beer is probably not at its best.
Crouch Vale Brewers Gold Extra;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Crouch Vale Brewery;Cask gravity at Jersey BF 2007. Golden with a very short head. Citrus/flowery bouquet. Not particularly bitter or sweet, slightly malty with lime at the back. Simple, refreshing, good.
Crouch Vale Brewers Gold Extra;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Crouch Vale Brewery;Cask 3 Judges ... This took me by suprise as i wasnt that keen on the non extra variety... Light Gold ...Fruity hop nose ... light fruity the golden hop innot fond of but balanced well with some sweetness andsome fruity malt.
Crouch Vale Brewers Gold Extra;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Crouch Vale Brewery;Cask at Three Judges, Glasgow. Golden colour. Great aroma here, with notes of citruses and grapes, yet on that low, pleasant level where it does not get overwhelming. Just plain subtle charm here. Flavour is greatly aromatic and delicate at the same time with a smooth, juicy hoppiness and superbly balanced. Low-medium bodied, with a soft bitterness that I find perfect.
Crouch Vale Brewers Gold Extra;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Crouch Vale Brewery;Cask at Three Judges, Glasgow. Hazy golden. Rich grapefruity hop aroma. Medium sweet and full bodied with rounded mouthfeel. Seemless flavour of American perfumy lytchee-like hops. Really good beer, but I think I actually preferred the regular strength version.
Crouch Vale Brewers Gold Extra;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Crouch Vale Brewery;(RBESG 2007, Cask at Three Judges, Glasgow) Pale golden, small white head.

Trafalgar Raspberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;650 ml bottle from Beer Store. Delicate pink colour? Uh no. Pours a cloudy toilet water ultra-pale yellow with no head. There may be some raspberry in the aroma but its mostly masked by a foul, sour vinegar smell. Taste is lifewise dominated by sour, acidic vinegar. A disaster.
Trafalgar Raspberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Absurdly effervescent, ends up with a huge fizzy pink head on a red body. Smell is sickly sweet and almost rotten raspberries. Honey is missing in action here. Taste is worse, acidic and disgustingly sweet in equal measure. Thin and overcarbonated. Just bad all around.
Trafalgar Raspberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Once again another gross mead by this company, but not quite as bad as the blueberry.
Trafalgar Raspberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;[492-20070810] Tap @ TFOB (Toronto, ON). Medium gasoline and alcohol aroma. Clear, bright red body with a medium-lasting foamy white head. Sweet burnt honey flavour is mostly a cloying raspberry seed base. Medium body. Offensive sweetness but interesting to try.
Trafalgar Raspberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;650 ml bottle. Pale pink colour, slight sparkling character as well. Nose shows light raspberry character over a hint of wildflower honey. A little bit floral as well, but the nose is quite simple and straightforward. Flavour is quite sweet showing honey and appley sweetness with a soft jammy raspberry flavour. Fairly dessert-wine like. There is a a hint of bitterness on the back that seems unusual given the ingredients. Not terribly complex, but it�s a servicable melomel.
Trafalgar Raspberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"Bottle: Don�t know whether I got a bottle of cleaning sludge from the fermenter or not. No red color to this...I got a cloudy, roily looking pale straw colored liquid with a instantly disappering cap. The ""aroma"" is more like a ""reek"" or stench: Strong fetid- musty(mildew) smells and thick fusel alcohol with vinigar-like sourness...I think I got some cleaning fluids from the fermentor! The taste was not mush different from the smell....astringet vinegar tastes with some artificial berry tastes, thick fusils and a nasty yeast taste. Sink- pour and the last anything I buy from this brewer. I think this drink can go the match with Steelback Tango as the most offensive malt beverage on the market."
Trafalgar Raspberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Seemed like a raspberry cooler to me. I dont think I will drink this stuff again.
Trafalgar Raspberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle (250ml). Poured with no head, bright red / red-pink, lots of very fine bubbles which coat the glass. Aroma is very strong overripe raspberry, sugar, honey and a touch of vinegar - no alcohol at all. Taste is surprisingly like tart well-done toast, the raspberry�s more in the finish - slightly sour, lightly oily moutfeel. A bit bitter at the end. Still don�t taste the 9% alcohol. Not my thing - I�ve had real mead, which I quite liked.
Trafalgar Raspberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;650ml brown bottle. Poured blood red, eternally fizzing thin head. Raspberry nose. Shows brief signs of tartness, some fruit. Rather thin, over carbonation detracts a lot from this brew. Finish is acidy. Not my cup of mead.
Trafalgar Raspberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;It sorta reminds me of the Wildberry, only replace wildberries with raspberries obviously. Nice appearance here.....decent red body, with a foamy and short lived pink head. Aromas are vinegary, raspberries, sweet citric aromas. taste is citric, raspberries, some vinegar, sour fruit, all sorts of stuff I cant discern. It�s ok.
Trafalgar Blueberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Yes it has that sweet honey meady taste, but the blueberry taste is absent. Slightly grapy. Overall it's pretty dull and alcohol-y. Not much carbonation. Cough medicine.
Trafalgar Blueberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"375 mL bottle purchase at the LCBO. Sealed with a cork which was near � impossible to open. Pours a dark cherry red with plenty of carbonation and no measurable head. The nose is off. On the palate there's a mix of flavored with nothing really discernible. There may be a hint of blueberry and there's definitely some residual honey. There is a fairly long finish which is neither pleasant nor unpleasant, it's just there. Not sure if this is typical of needs (which I have had very few) or if I really find this to be a poor product. Would not recommend, would not buy again. Note that this product is emblazoned with ""Lanark County"" but it's actually just brewed in Oakville. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Trafalgar Blueberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"Bottle, Embrun LCBO. Reddish brown pour, foamy white head. Odd sweet, red wine like aroma with fruit, not pleasant. Very sweet honey up front; the fruit comes in near the finish. Harsh alcohol burn. There is some flavour here, but what a harsh unrefined package. Not enjoyable at all."
Trafalgar Blueberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;375ml bottle. Clear reddish body, small beige head with poor retention. Aroma of grains and honey, a little floral, fermented bread. A winy taste: fermented bread, honey, tart berries, splenda, strongly alcoholic. Nasty stuff.
Trafalgar Blueberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle: Poured a light blue-ish color mead which is very still. Aroma of gross blueberry notes with overly sweet ester. Taste is absolutely atrocious with no balance and gross notes with blueberries barely standing out. I don�t� recall having tasted such a bad mead in my life. My buddy homebrewed mead is better than this crap.
Trafalgar Blueberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Poured bright, dark red with a disappearing off white head. Aroma of sweet, tart berries. Medium body, flavour of the aroma, quite bitter sweet.
Trafalgar Blueberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Originally rated April 2005. Pours a darker-then-medium red with a big fizzy head that reminds me off a soft drink, but stays a few seconds more. Lots of particules floating around. Fruity nose mixed with lots of alcohol. Thin mouthfeel and not much taste. Alcohol going to the head, that�s about it. Mild fruity berry aftertaste. Still waiting to find a good Trafalgar product. Average for now.
Trafalgar Blueberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;The grossest alcoholic beverage i have ever tasted. i could not even finish it which ia really bad for me
Trafalgar Blueberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;nose is nice does smell like blue berry, flavor is over carbonated, syruppy sweet, like they are making a mead cooler, i want to like it but just cant
Trafalgar Blueberry Mead;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Relatively light in taste and feel for a beer made with real juiced berries AND honey - I detect a little blueberry in the mix, which it is NOT a powerful flavor compliment to the base ale and so has to be accepted as part of the overall effect rather than a distinct feature. Said effect is a light, pleasantly drinkable vaguely fruity ale with a nondescript base ale character and far too much alcohol paying the price for the minimal entertainment. Quality to an extent, but a novelty.
Pyramid Double IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);A little bit of a sharp after taste but good flavor. Not too dark. Great for Ipa flavor.
Pyramid Double IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Surprised to see this show up at the local distributor, only in 1/2 bbl kegs, I thought this beer had been retired but it is back with a heck of a hops wallop. Very aromatic hops, darker amber color and heavier in body than most IPA�s and seems to have that 8.8% alcohol at least. Give this one a try.
Pyramid Double IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);On tap at MacTarnahans Taproom in PDX (8.1% ABV) --Poured a copper-amber body with a small whitish head. Nose of piny, bitter, acidic hopiness. Grainy, metallic (slightly) and highly carbonated for the style. Bitterness and oily hops all over tongue. Not much bigger than the Thunderhead and similar flavor profile. Not well balanced, but definitely hoppy, and I like that in a beer.
Pyramid Double IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);A clear amber beer with a small off-white head. The aroma is sweet with notes of caramel and hops - though no overwhelming hop notes. The flavor is sweet and hoppy as well as grassy. A nice brew, but not as extreme as I had expected from the name.
Pyramid Double IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle. This stuff smells really hoppy. Has a nice opaque amber color with a slight lace head. Has a good flavor to it. Not too bitter but it bites you a little. Weak finish but overall a good beer
Pyramid Double IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Draft. Reddish amber color with no head. Pine malt aroma - big hops. Pine tar and citrus (grapefruit) flavors. Some caramel. Nice full mouthfeel. Can just feel the alcohol. By far their best beer. If they could make this a regular, I�d be there more often.
Pyramid Double IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);(Great American Beer Festival 2004) Very fresh hop nose. Full and bitter Sweet and barley wine like. Average to good.
Pyramid Double IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Hoppy aroma and taste- I�d guess it�s close to 100 IBU�s. But it does not hide it�s alcohol well.
Pyramid Double IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);I love this beer. So hoppy my mouth was in love. After a few pints do not drive home. Oh my goodness, I want some right now!
Pyramid Double IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Heavy, VERY hoppy brew. Thick body, somewhere between a barley wine and an IPA. Alcoholy warmth after you've had a few sips. Head doesn't last very long unfortunately. Could be a little more malty for my taste. (this is a rotating beer that they make every few months at the local alehouses as part of their Brewer's Handle series.)
Hetman Premium Light;Krasnystaw, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Browar Hetman;Well crafted set of aromas sadly the beer it self was not the freshest. Hoppy, earthy that kills its freshness.
PC Premium Draft;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Originally rated March 2006. Comes in a clear bottle. Pours a yellow colour with very high carbonation. The head is white, creamy-fizz, has medium retention and leaves a bit of lace. Aromas of alcohol and bad grass. Smooth mouthfeel. The taste is kind of weird with some corn in the finish. Some kind of cheap malt or hop, tasting like cabbage. Tastes much better dranked from the bottle.
PC Premium Draft;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Corn adjucts.. pale lager... rating it... beer... watery... sweet... yeah.... To spend a deep time imersing yourself in providing a useful rating for other to look at might be considered by some a waste of time. Look at the numbers and do the math.
PC Premium Draft;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;looks like beer and taste like beer. not great but not bad. would only buy it again when they drop the price back down to 26.40.
PC Premium Draft;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Medium dark amber body with an average sized white head. Corn, grain, cereal, and skunk in the aroma. Slight bitter corn flavour. Thin, watery, and nothing draft or premium about it.
PC Premium Draft;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Swillfest �04: Malty, grassy aroma. Relatively sweet body, with a hint of sourness in the finish. Could be worse.
PC Premium Draft;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Aroma of sweet malt, weak hints of hop extract. Pale gold. Some nutty element, sweet brown sugars. This beer is too sweet to be refreshing.
PC Premium Draft;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Who knew that PC made beer! Discovered at a friend's place, it was golden, typical white head. This isn't a bad beer but is uninspired and a little bland - mostly from lack of any depth or character.
PC Premium Draft;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;(Bottle) Pours a medium, white head and an amber body. Slight hops aroma. Sad hoopy taste and overcarbonated. Poor.
PC Premium Draft;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Gold in colour. This is just another typical bland, boring, waste of time beers made by Labatt's.

Kunter Mocny 14.5�;Grudziadz, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Grudziadz;Very good strong lager from Grudziadz brewery! Big, foamy head, golden colour. Little aroma, but this beer has got a complex, herbal flavour with nice dry end and absolutely no traces of alcohol. Lilltle hops or malt, which is very unlikely for a Polish strong lager. Surprisingly good, especially in its class.

Br�utigam Pilsner;Eltmann-Weisbrunn, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Br�utigam;Draft at brewpub: Yellow golden. Dying white head. Worty, unclean nose of nutty yeast, honeyed malt, and herbal hops. Prickly carbonation. Weighty body. Curious absence of hop flavor is overrun with a sharp and overaggressive hop charge. Dully hoppy with toasted malt husks. Intensely nutty, crunchy and cereal-like. Pistachio-like yeast character further weighs the body down as it exacerbates the poor attenuation and high honeyed-grain concentration. Again, no salvaging refined hop flavor to be found anywhere. Finishes doughy, muddled and abrasively hoppy with a late herbal snap. Bad batch, who knows? Very unclean and poorly attenuated.
Br�utigam Pilsner;Eltmann-Weisbrunn, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Br�utigam;Bottled@brewpub (thanks to SADESA for sharing). Golden colour, small white head.

Bitter End Longboard Lager;Austin, Texas, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Tap. Well, SWEET...they finally brought this back so I can inch a little bit closer to 100% of Bitter End beers. Now if they could just bring back the Hammerhead Porter, which hasn�t been on tap for like 9 months and that I somehow missed the whole time...ahh, anyway. Orange color with an off-white head and a little effervescence. Mild and very bready, going well with one of their pizzas. Nice sweet malts that are an interesting and original take on the style. Well done!
Bitter End Longboard Lager;Austin, Texas, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Had on tap at the brewpub in Austin. Dark golden to light orange pour with a decent white head. Aroma has some fresh lake water accents with a brief hint of honey. Flavor has some sweet honey notes as well with some underlying cotton candy sweetness. Very smooth and drinkable with a thick creamy mouthfeel. One of the best brewpub lagers that I have come. Not strong in any one category but all around a good drinkable lager.
Bitter End Longboard Lager;Austin, Texas, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Nice. Somewhat herbal for a lager and fairly flavorful, as is just about everything brewed by Bitter End. Perhaps my favorite of their brews on tap on this day. Fairly mild.

Badger Fursty Ferret (Bottle);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);"500ml can brewed in Dorset at 4.4%. Translucent, sheeny orange-brown. 50/50 head, dissipating fairly quickly. Faint meadowy aroma, bit of grass, bit of zest, further nosing reveals toffee malt. Low carbonation. Does what it says on the tin - malt backbone, vaguely in the lager style but with more breadth and depth (bit of biscuit with the bread), supporting overtures of lemony and floral hops, with shades of bitterness and carefully not-overdone sweetness. A fine thirst-quencher, with more to it than your lager offerings - well designed for just this niche I suspect. Pleasant but unlikely to be anyone's favourite ale after they've had a few different ones; eminently sessionable and seems designed to not overdo it on the flavour - a good or bad point depending on your intended purpose, however here the clue is in the name - this is a swiller, a thirst-quencher, and for one of those it brings good flavour alongside refreshment. For savouring purposes, this won't upset, but will come off a tad bland. Give this to your lager-drinking friends and see what they think!"
Badger Fursty Ferret (Bottle);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Light amber colour with a full off-white head that doesn�t linger, faint aroma - musty, biscuity. Likewise the taste - soft biscuits and malt, but undemanding and not complex. The label tells us that �ferret� is Latin for �little thief� and that the beer is named after a ferret that once stole a taste of it. I like to learn something with my beer. Drinkable, the best on the rack at the local co-op.
Badger Fursty Ferret (Bottle);Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Bottle from Waitrose, West Byfleet. Weak malts and boiled veg aroma. Chestnut. Thin white head. Sweet-sour berries with more malts into the finish. Light bitter core. Light-medium bodied.Slick if on the thin side. Average-fizzy carbonation. Abrupt finish. Decent enough bitter. Not something I go out of my way for other than that it's a Dorset tick.

Slightly hazy body with a medium sized off-white head. The aroma is weird and difficult to place otherwise than something sweet and artificial, nothing that reminds of beer here.

Yet another of these creative German ""Mischgetr�nke"" - they really will mix anything for you...This is 80% Hefe and 20% capirinha flavoured pop with added taurine and caffeine. Sort of a chemical lab on bottle... Looks hazy golden with a somewhat indefinable sediment. Weird, fruity sweetness. But did I really get a kick out of this? Cool blue swingtop bottle though. 190103"
Flensburger Energy;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Flavored - Fruit;Flensburger Brauerei;The aroma is extremely sweet from caipirinha - like a Red Bull. The color is a slightly hazy light yellow and it has a fine lasting head. The flavor is weak at first, then turning caipirinha sweet, just to disappear fast. All in all a thin weizen added too much sweetness. If You want a beer to give You a jolt try Cambridge Brewing Co. Expresso Stout.
WinterCoat Scottish Ale;Sabro, Denmark;Scottish Ale;WinterCoat;This beer has next to no aroma only a slight note of fruit. The color is orange or amber and it is slightly unclear with a small fast disappearing head. The flavor is fruity and it has a good bitterness from a good hop. It is not very sweet - and is rather thin - so I don't think of it as a Scottich Ale.

Clear gold with thin, smooth white head which laces side of the glass initially. Citric hop aromas and some grassiness before a spicy kick hits the roof of the mouth, this spiciness is not unlike that of Orval.

Tried over two successive nights and an average score given. The first night this tasted green and slightly off; the second night is tasted fresh and good. I necked the first pint in no time. It�s a mid brown beer with a nicely conditioned bubbly head. The dry hopping doesn�t really come through that well although this is doubtless due to the hops used which would be the English variety. Instead I got some fruity malts and a little bitterness. As mentioned - variable, but it was very good on night 2.Score 2.9 Subsequent rating three years later scored 3.5 and then in 2010, 2.6.

Kemptown Kemptown;Brighton, East Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Kemptown Brewery;Hand in Hand, Brighton. Very hoppy bitter which almost over-powers the toffee malt.

Not horrible, but just slightly odd.

I could pretty much write the same about this beer as Ye Old Trout except it had slightly more body. Again the taste is on the fruity side and tasted a little homebrewish and green.

Kemptown Dragons Blood;Brighton, East Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;Kemptown Brewery;[Cask at The Hand in Hand, Brighton] A deep red beer witha small white head. The aroma is light, but malty.

Georgetown Manny's Pale Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Georgetown Brewing Company;I like the initial earthy taste.

Hale's Aftermath Imperial IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hale's Ales;Draught at Wig Wam last night so they must be brewing it again. A very pleasant orange with a white head. Fresh, juicy citrus notes throughout. A mild toasted malt backbone carries it just enough but the player on the scene is the citrus. Finish is full of that juicy citrus and get a tad sweet. Very enjoyable DIPA.
Hale's Aftermath Imperial IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hale's Ales;Apparently available again. On tap, pours a clear honey color with a one finger eggshell head and good lacing. Aroma is light sweet hoppy citrus fruit. Flavor is similar, mild bitterness. A very well done brew.
Hale's Aftermath Imperial IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hale's Ales;modest 2 finger head that dies back leaving spotty sticky lacing.. Brew is hazy orange copper. Aroma is pithy citrus hops.. smells juicy... not much malt to speak of... some sweetness for sure but is blown out of the water by the hops. Not as bitter as some more well known ideas... but Holy Hoppy from early to late palate.. there is plenty of sweetness... but again.. it is all the hops from front to back. Body is on the thicker side for the style... oily and viscous... somehow it remains balanced for a PNW DIPA.
Hale's Aftermath Imperial IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hale's Ales;22oz bottle 8/8/15 (Pear Delicatessen)-Pours an orangish amber with a decent head. Aroma of hops and malt. Taste of the same. This medium bodied brew wasn�t good but wasn�t bad.
Hale's Aftermath Imperial IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hale's Ales;Bomber. Pours a golden orange with an off white head and aroma of hops and citrus. Taste is bitter, with hops, citrus, grapefruit, and pine notes into the dry, bitter finish.

Very good, but probably not fresh."
Hale's Aftermath Imperial IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hale's Ales;Bottle - Sweet earthy hops and caramel. Dirty gold with a decent off white head. Sweet caramel and bitter hops with a long sweet bitter finish. Not bad.
Hale's Aftermath Imperial IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hale's Ales;22 oz bottle @ Hale�s. Pours cloudy dark orange with thin white head. Aroma is thin sugary sweet malt and muted citrus hops. Taste is similar: thin malt is quickly overwhelmed by heavy sugary sweetness which pushes through the hops on the finish. Some nice big flavors in the hops - pine, orange, and grass - but again they�re really obscured by the lingering sweetness of the malt. Not that bad, really, but... odd beer.
Hale's Aftermath Imperial IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hale's Ales;Serving: from tap at Smarty Pants. Aroma: moderate, piney hoppy aroma. Appearance: small, creamy, off-white, initial head with fair lacing and fully diminishing longevity. Cloudy, medium-amber body. Taste: heavily bitter initial flavor, and heavily sour grapefruit-like finish with long duration. Palate: medium-to-heavy bodied with dry texture and soft carbonation. Overall: huge taste but too heavy-handed for me.
Far West U-19 German Pilsner;Redmond, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Far West Brewing Company;(Draft: Celtic Bayou in Redmond, WA) More hoppy than the blonde ale, but the sweet, grainy flavor shows just as much presence, and this pilsner isn�t nearly as clean as I was expecting. Sweet and grainy aroma lacks the hop character of a good pilsner. The body is light-to-medium, but a bit heavier than most pilsners. Clear, golden color, with a whitish head that settles to a broken layer, but leaves a fairly large swatch of lace on the glass. Serviceable for a blonde ale, but not a good example of the pilsner style.
Far West U-19 German Pilsner;Redmond, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Far West Brewing Company;This was a really weak attempt at a pilsner. Way over hopped with some citrusy/floral hops, nothing subtle about, just in your face hops and bitterness. To bold of a beer that really missed the idea of the great delicateness of the pilsner style.
Far West U-19 German Pilsner;Redmond, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Far West Brewing Company;Golden blond with a nice layer of smooth cream.

On tap as a special bitter at the brewpub. Pours a nice hazy dark gold color with a thin white head. Aroma is a little malt but has a nice citrus hop kick. Flavor is pleasantly bitter with a nice malt balance. Good beer.
Snipes Mountain Red Sky ESB;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;Bronze color with decent head. Don�t detect the subtle flavors advertised for the beer in the brewery. A mid-range, but unspectacular IPA/APA straddler that they cal an ESB.
Snipes Mountain Red Sky ESB;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;From a bomber. Pours a cloudy orange-brown with a big robust head. The very nice aroma is dominated by soft fruit (pear and mild grapefruit) and brown sugar malts. The flavor The flavor is rich and malty, but not overly so, and the fruity hops (hinting at times at an almost barleywine complexity) come in to balance the whole thing out in a very nice way. The beer is not too sweet, not to bitter, with a gentle chalky aftertaste that I find quite pleasant. The mouthfeel seems spot-on for the style. I like this beer, and it could easily become a session regular for me, especially if available in 12oz form. I can understand why this one is getting more low threes than high threes, but it�s hard for me to understand the really low ratings that it is receiving. Perhaps the quality has improved this year? I don�t know.

Snipes Mountain Red Sky ESB;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;"28-Dec-05 (22 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with Larry Pitonka, thanks Andr�!) I�m very happy to have a fresh bottle because boy, that first bottle was a total disaster. Popping the cap, there was no ""Michael Bay"" explosion, and it didn�t foam up when pouring the beer. And no soapiness or overripe apples in the flavor. No, instead, this is a healthy beer, and very tasty indeed. Up front, there�s lots of toast, mildly roasty and lightly sweet maltiness and a touch of caramel, with a moderately bitter and slightly citrusy hoppiness kicking in the midpoint that easily balances the ample malt and finishes with dominance. The beer is good out of the fridge, but is still very flavorful and enjoyable at room temperature as well. There is also a slight chalkiness to the flavor and mouthfeel. Body is medium, but shows no signs of thinning in the finish. Carbonation is solid but gentle on the palate. The nose is lightly malty, hoppy and somewhat dusty, but doesn�t impress as much as the flavor. Fairly hazy amber body is crowned by an inch of very bubbly, off-white head. Overall, with the assertive malt character and snappy hop bite, it�s a west coast ESB through and through. Definitely worth of the effort to get a second bottle.18-Oct-05 (22 oz bottle: $3.29 at John�s Marketplace in Portland, OR) We have two problems with this bottle of beer. First is the insane amount of carbonation. This beer is so overcarbonated, I scoop all the light-tan head out of my pint glass, and the head builds right back up again. It�s like the magician pulling the handkerchief out of his pocket. And then my taking a small sip of the beer results in an explosion inside my mouth. The second problem is the intense soapiness of the aroma. This is about as strong a soapiness as I can remember in any beer, and it�s almost unbearable. Fortunately, the flavor isn�t as bad, perhaps because the malt flavor of this beer is strong enough to overcome the soapiness to some degree. Nevertheless, this really isn�t drinkable, and I�ll have to obtain a new bottle if at all possible. (2, 2, 4, 2, 7 = 1.7)"

Baron Kellerbier;Seattle, Washington, United States;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;A true rare find in the states. Bronze with and interesting, hard to place aroma.

Baron Munich Lager;Seattle, Washington, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;2004 draught @ Redbones. Light tangerine juice-like appearance, yellowish and lightly hazed with a small white head, though a bit too pale for the style. Aroma of saaz hops, not overly so, with some pils malt dryness and a bit of graininess. Begins with a crisp and interesting bite to it, with notes of yeast, almonds and honey, but the body dies off immediately afterwards. Wateriness to the extreme, low flavor through the middle and only a short, grain and alcohol sort of finish. The sour/sweet skunkiness is present, a strange stale/sharp alcohol tone, and though it begins to-style, it quickly becomes rather nostalgic of a crappy adjunt lager, as Bill says. Medium-light body.
Baron Munich Lager;Seattle, Washington, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;Hazy banana liquer look. A fairly standard helles, albeit fresher. It still has a rather dank, lightly annoying, offkey corn syrupy sweetness quality--though subdued. Not a favorite style of mine.

Prescott F�nkenDunkel;Prescott, Arizona, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Prescott Brewing Company;The almost perfect dark beer. Very nutty taste, smooth finish, not very bitter.

Copper color, almost no head, aroma of light sweet malt; doesn�t really invite me much. Flavor is moderately sweet, with ripe fruit notes, and a slight medicinal quality.

Anacortes Aviator Doppelbock;Anacortes, Washington, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Rockfish Grill & Anacortes Brewery;Whooahh...way too much caramel in the malt, it just brings the rest of the beer out of focus. Just too unbalanced, I think I taste a touch of espresso in the backlground (?) which is strange, but then again I feel like I've been drinking straight malt extract, so my taste buds may be a bit confused.
Anacortes Aviator Doppelbock;Anacortes, Washington, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Rockfish Grill & Anacortes Brewery;"Lovely maroon amber color with a nice head. Decent malt aroma, however; like the other WA doppelbocks experienced to this point, it was dissapointing for the style. No distinguishing features--the malt is detectable, but not delicious and at some points, rather bland. Ok."
Hale's K�lsch;Seattle, Washington, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Hale's Ales;Canned, 355ml from Honest Brew of Crystal Palace, London. Clouded gold with short white head. There was a mixed start to this, boiled cabbage was the first impression but this was followed with a sweetish, if slightly tinny, maltiness. There was a hint of mustiness from an aggressive carbonation. Possibly the saver for me was the Saaz hop hit, lime and lemon notes. Just okay really.

LaConner Schwarzbier;LaConner, Washington, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;LaConner Brewing Company;Schwarzbier Lager--2004 12 oz. Bottle. 5.75% ABV. 25 IBU�s? (3.25 / 5.0) Black Lager. Mild lace head. Light sediment. Hazy ugly brown red color. Fruity ester mild hop front. Sweet fruity mild toasted toffee caramel Porter Ale ester body. Tart citrus mild hop end. Disappointing. Poor Labeling. Sampled 3/6/2005.
LaConner Schwarzbier;LaConner, Washington, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;LaConner Brewing Company;(12 oz bottle: Bottleworks in Seattle, WA) This is a pretty old bottle I presume, and the beer has almost assuredly taken on characteristics that weren�t there originally, most notably, the fairly potent sourness. But I have to say, the sourness is actually quite nice. Rather than tasting like a schwarzbier, this is starting to remind me of some of the Flemish sour brown ales I�ve had in the past. Flavors include: tangy and acidic sourness, tart cherry, somewhat dark malt base with a hint of sweetness, and some wood and earth from the aging. The nose is sour, somewhat cherry-like, and slightly earthy. Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, and the sourness is very refreshing on the palate. The color is a medium-dark ruddy brown, but most certainly not black or even close. Half an inch of light tan head gradually settles to a wide ring. Though probably not intended, the onset of the sourness in this beer has been an interesting and thoroughly enjoyable development.
LaConner Schwarzbier;LaConner, Washington, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;LaConner Brewing Company;Bottle: Great aromas of pitted fruit like prunes and raisins which deceive your taste buds as they are blown away by the ultra tangy, sour hops. This is reminiscent of Worcestershire sauce (credit to Indiana_Red�s wife Melissa for this original identification). The color is dark brown, uhh, I mean schwarz and is accompanied by a frothy, light brown head. The carbonation levels are high which make the tang even more apparent. Good one, grows on you after you get used to the hops. Thanks Indiana_Red for sharing.
LaConner Schwarzbier;LaConner, Washington, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;LaConner Brewing Company;Clean black colour. Thin rocky head that fades quickly. Mild malt nose. Flat malty taste that lingers.
LaConner Schwarzbier;LaConner, Washington, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;LaConner Brewing Company;Hazy brick. Lacing, soapy bubbled foam with scattered islands of cream. Clean, but slightly metallic aroma with a slippery fruitiness and airy roast twinge. Earthy malt, sulfur accents with phenols and cocoa hints. Fairly loose carbonation but solid bodied. Acidity greets the palate, swirled with an unwavering mixture of phenols and roast astringency. Rich chocolate frosting, earthy roast, and squeaky clean lagery notes lurk beneath. Slightly gritty with cane sugar hints, but continually clean with husky malt layers that impart more fluffy girth to the body. Finishes clean with a dry, spicy bite of chalky malts and earthy hops. With the exception of the phenols and sourness, this is very well structured, highly drinkable, hoppy example of the style. Most likely an outdated bottle, but there�s no date stamp to be found.
LaConner Schwarzbier;LaConner, Washington, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;LaConner Brewing Company;Bottle Pours a very dark brown with a huge fluffy pale tan head that slowly receded. Very nice lacing. Aromas are a yummy carmel, dark malt and sweet brown sugar. Flavors are a sour woody carmel taste. Also of rasons and other dark pittededs. That sour taste puts me off a bit but it�s not bad. Feel is thick and smooth with a soft carbonation.
LaConner Schwarzbier;LaConner, Washington, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;LaConner Brewing Company;GABF 2004: RIch dark copper brown with a thin off-white head. Smooth, subtle dark malty aroma. Dry roasty malty body has a touch of caramel sweetness and lager yeast. Very smooth and balanced, this would make a good session beer. A nice rendition of the style.
LaConner Schwarzbier;LaConner, Washington, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;LaConner Brewing Company;"Black, black, black! This beer tastes very ""black."" Extremely bitter but not really hop bitter, just bitter. A little like 1554. Good example of the style."
LaConner Schwarzbier;LaConner, Washington, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;LaConner Brewing Company;Nice and smooth, malty mouthfeel. Sweet, subtle dark malts. Needs to be a little more smokey in my opinion. Still a good beer of course!

Bert Grant's Mandarin Hefeweizen;Yakima, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;Had this beer on 8/11/2004. Aroma is not that impressive, with only a faint citrus scent. Color is a hazy bright gold with very good carbonation and a thin little head. Taste is light and clean. Starting with a light body it goes down with a fizzy feel. Finish comes in with a very light malt flavor backed by a faint citrus taste and ends with a little bitter bite. Overall it�s just not a Hefey. It is a refreshing summer brew but it lacks flavor, there is almost no mandarin and none of that rich sweet, yeasty flavor in a good Hefey.

De Dolle 21 3x7 Jong;Diksmuide, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Dolle Brouwers;13/I/13 - 33cl bottle from Erasmus Hotel, back in the days when it was still a beery place @ Klaas� place - BB: VI/2000 - bottled: VI/98 (2013-20) Huge thanks to Klaas for sharing the bottle! Clear orange beer, irregular unstable yellowish head, bit adhesive, some sediment floating around in the glass. Still an amazing head after almost 15 years! Aroma: sweet and sugary, honey, dry sherry, orange peel, candied orange peel, marzipan, spices, madeira. MF: ok carbon, medium to full body. Taste: bit sourish, orange peel, sugary touch, little vinegar, sour apples, pretty fruity. Aftertaste: honey, little bitter, citric acidity, orange peel, alcohol noticeable. It is very clear from this beer that Kris uses a cooling ship to cool the wort. After all those years the wild yeast and bacteria make the beer more sour than at first, which makes the beer preserve better. Very nice beer if you like both sours and aged beers!

Pours a mostly transparent golden orange brown with a thin layer if offwhite head... Rich sherry aroma with figs, honey, and dark Belgian sugars. Aged for sure with mild oxidation. Sweet all around... Flavors are on par with the difference being a faint to mild citric fruit tartness towards the backend.

De Dolle 21 3x7 Jong;Diksmuide, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Dolle Brouwers;Bottle at Hotel Erasmus, Brugge 02.10.10 Hazy amber appearance with a slim white head. The aroma is quite weird but likeable, I get mouldering fruit, you know like orange with a bit of white mould on em� in the fruit basket, Loz get�s gravy granules, so an interesting combination. Flavour lean�s more towards the fruit element rather than the gravy side but its a bit sour, the alcohol showing towards the end. It�s fine but not as great as I was hoping, maybe it�s on the downward spiral, btw the beer menu said 1989 but the bottle said 1998. A8 A4 T6 P3 Ov14 3.5

Bulldog Espresso Stout;Fresno, California, United States;Stout;Bulldog Brewing Company (CA);Dark opaque brown with a small beige head. The aroma was a nice combination of espresso, chocolate, hops bitterness, and smokiness. The flavor was pretty much just espresso with a hops bitter aftertaste. Too much carbonation for this brew...very crisp feeling (maybe why this is a summer stout.)

Full Sail Hangtime Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;bottle-I had very low expectations going into this brew, but i seemed to think it was better than the ratings give it.

Full Sail Hangtime Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;"The beer pours a pellucid golden amber color, the head minimal; frothy in texture and it vanishes quite quickly leaving a thin sheet of lace to cover the glass. Nose is citrus crisp, clean and fresh, somewhat sweet as is the start that is also thickly malt; top is skinny in its feel to the palate. Finish is sprightly acidic and the hops pleasant enough in their spicy presence, dry lingering aftertaste, and a nice drinkable beer, not great, but drinkable nonetheless."

Fischer Bockbier;H�chstadt-Greuth, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Brauerei Norbert Fischer;Bottled, from Landbierparadies. Deep copper colour, rich creamy head - looks delicious! Caramelly nose with some chocolate. Mid sweet with soft mouthfeel and medium-full body. Creamy with caramel and cocoa powder. Low bitterness. Despite its depth and mellowness, this beer does not really turn me on - it is too sweet and caramelly.

Clear mahogany with no head. Smells really vinous, tart fruitiness, sine melanoidin, sherry, something is wrong here. Medium body, almost still. Quite oxidized, slightly fruity and tasty, vinous, bad; off-dry with some bitterness and a very oxidized, unpleasant finish. Suspect packaging failure."
Pilka Tamno Pivo;Mursko Sredi��e, Croatia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovara i Pivnica Cimper;05/04 On tap at restaurant Pilka, Cakovec (former brewpub). It had murky dark brown reddish body with medium half white, half ocher head. Aroma is faint, roasted sugar and caramel, with some faint hopiness mixing with sourness from being not pasteurized. Flavor was bitter, sour and sweetish, roasted sugar dominated, with lot of coffee and slight acidity well incorporating into the whole thing. Typical Schwarzbier, but lacks some body, although not as much as the Pilsener. Finish is long, bitterish and really nice. So, liked it, would be even better with more body, but fine...
Pilka Tamno Pivo;Mursko Sredi��e, Croatia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovara i Pivnica Cimper;"1l fliptop bottle courtesy of heavy, who brought it from �akovec (a huge thanks for lugging it around!) Poured a murky red-brown body with a huge fluffy off-white spongey head that went away at a medium pace. The nose is predominantly caramel malt with some dusty yeastiness... a bit staleish but ok. The taste is ok, but not en par with the best in the country. Smooth mouthfeel, caramel, malt, some chewy and slightly acidulous hoppy bitterness somewhat ""tainted"" by roast in the background. Long, low, bitterish roasty aftertaste. All in all, it�s kinda pleasant, drinkable, but just too ordinary. Too light for its own good, lacking body. Has the same ""faults"" as the pale but they dectract from this one far more than they do for that one."

Pilka Rezano;Mursko Sredi��e, Croatia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pivovara i Pivnica Cimper;05/04 On tap at restaurant Pilka, Cakovec (former brewpub). This is mixed dark and pale beer, had slightly murky brown amber body with bigger ebony head. Aroma similar to their dark beer, roasted caramel with faint hopiness. Unpasteurized sourness if, of course, felt. Well balanced aroma, maybe even better than of its parts, but the flavor is not, as it is much lighter, like pale beer, but with most characteristics inherited from dark one, dominated by bittersweet roasted sugar. Pretty short, but pleasant finish. As Doggythedog said, the sum happened to be lesser than the parts.
Pilka Rezano;Mursko Sredi��e, Croatia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pivovara i Pivnica Cimper;Courtesy of heavy, thanks! As it happens so often with these, the sum is lesser than the parts. Nice dark amber colour, medium sized off white head that went away fast. Yeasty/malty nose. Watery, notes of caramel, some bread, a bit acidulous, with notes of lemony hopiness and a low roastiness. Oddly, seems less bitter than the Svijetlo and the Tamno and I like it less than them. It�s nice enough but I wonder if it should even be in the database.

John Shippeys Blackhook Lager;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Deep dark beer with no head. Not carbonated yet (fresh out of the tank).

John Shippeys Blackhook Lager;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Very dark brown. Very woody, smokey (cedar?) aroma. Flavour is smokey with light chocolate and toast notes. Slight nuttiness.
John Shippeys Blackhook Lager;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Black with a thin tan coloured head. Smoky, roasted, nutty aroma. Flavours of smoke, peat, expresso, and butterscotch finishing with a pleasant smoky bitterness. Medium bodied, thick mouthfeel for a lager. They also have a Blackhook Porter, made with similar ingredients. I was told the lager is made in the summer because they go through more beer, and can make the lager more quickly.
Three Coins Irish Dark;Meegoda, Sri Lanka;Red Ale - Irish;Millers Brewery;Bottle from Terre de Boissons Calais and drunk at home. Very dark red dark brown colour lasting tan head. Milk chocolate aroma with some dark fruits too. OK carbonation. I thought that this was quite malty easy drinking interesting beer and it hides the ABV very well. Yes tasty indeed. Just a little bit of paper somewhere, but otherwise fine.
Three Coins Irish Dark;Meegoda, Sri Lanka;Red Ale - Irish;Millers Brewery;Out of the three separate bargain basement beers purchased.. this was by far the most palatable. Spot on to style. Malt centric and not too sweet. Finish is smooth and rounded. I actually was a bit disappointed that the bottle was empty after the long encounter with a particularly stubborn table top jigsaw resurrection,

TwoRows Summer Ice;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;The weakest beer I think I've ever tasted. Yes the alcohol content is high but it had no flavor, aroma, head, or even color to it. Not bad for finishing out a night of drinking I guess. This is some pretty foul stuff.
Hakon Premium Pilsner;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);(500 ml can). Light golden colour, decent head. Fruity and yeasty aroma, aggressive carbonation, light bodied (no surprise!), moderate to low bitterness. Not too bad for an industrial pilsener, but not a great beer.
Weeping Radish Dunkel Weizen;Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;On draft at the brewery restaurant. Pours a cloudy light brown with an off white head. Not much in the atoms department. Feint cardboard flavors. Not too tasty.
Weeping Radish Dunkel Weizen;Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;Bottle. Brought back from the brewery by my wife. Dark cola colored pour. Short tan head. Nose is cola, sweet malt, watery caramel and faint wheat. Taste is a different story altogether. Normally, I�d think an infected beer would smell infected, but this doesn�t. However, the sour cherry and sour wheat flavors don�t really belong in a dunkelweizen. Some lemon as well. Yeast notes and faint malt. Body is light-medium with a soft, dense foam carbonation. Ends with more sour fruit notes, sour wheat, light malt and light caramel.
Weeping Radish Dunkel Weizen;Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;"With great trepidation after reading all the warnings, I'm putting in a new beer. I found it in a liter flip-cap bottle at the bottom of the take-out beer cooler at the brewery. The spelling of ""Wiezen,"" although incorrect, is what is on the bottle. I opened it up, and a frothy head of foam sprang up, and just kept coming and coming. Filled up two glasses with the foam alone. After this I was able to pour one I could actually drink. Hazy medium brown color appropriate for a the style. Huge head that lasted throughout the beer. Taste was surprisingly light, malty, but a bit thin in the middle. A bit of hops, and very faint bananas in the finish. I would have hoped for a bigger German yeast influence. Better overall than the hefe, but still not all that great a beer."

Nothing more.
River Horse Summer Blonde;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;From bottle to glass at Tribe Road Kitchen in Hamilton, Bermuda. With 45 minutes of free time during an overnight business trip, I happened upon a great lunch spot with a small, but eclectic bottle collection and chose one I had not had. This was light, crisp and refreshing in the heat. Bready malt was the main character of the flavor, with lemon on the aroma.
River Horse Summer Blonde;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;Pours from bottle a slightly clouded yellow-gold that clears steadily, with one-finger white head that leaves some lacing and skim. Light, uncomplicated aroma of biscuit and grass, tempted to say �smells like beer.� Palate adds gentle lemongrass, bread, hint of corn, mineral. Manages to provide a creamy mouthfeel despite fairly light body. Finish is crisp and clean. The simple approach works well for a summer beer. This is one of the better thirst-quenchers that I�ve had lately.
River Horse Summer Blonde;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;This is a very light beer. Not much aroma. I would like to compare this to a coors light beer. Yuk

Yarpivo Ledyanoe (Ice Beer);Yaroslavl, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);The aroma is grass, some corn sweetness. The apperance is straw yellow, white head, true to its style. The flavor is grassy, sweet, corn, low signature of malts or hops. The finish is a sweet syrupy corn like residue. Not good. I guess it�s ok for the odious pale lager style.
Yarpivo Ledyanoe (Ice Beer);Yaroslavl, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);Pour is a bright yellow with a average white head.

Yarpivo Ledyanoe (Ice Beer);Yaroslavl, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);"Pours a hazy straw color with 1/2"" of white foam and briefly fizzy carbonation. No head retention, no lacing. Mild skunkiness and some citrus in the aroma. Odd, the flavor is nothing like the aroma - no skunk at all, no citrus, little hoppiness. Instead, it has an initial and very brief wheat tang. Then its gone. Completely. This is replaced by a sweetness, tasting a little of honey and a lot of amber candi sugar. It is quite sweet, but shy of being cloying. A small hop presence makes itself known in the finish. Almost medium body, and surprisingly on the flat side."

Yarpivo Ledyanoe (Ice Beer);Yaroslavl, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);A light yellow beer with a bubbly white head. The aroma contains notes of straw and brewing cereal. The flavor is sweet yet sourness from the use of brewing cereal lingers in the background, leading to a very dry end with a strong note of hay combined with a slight bitterness. My guess was that there was corn in this beer, but the label tells me, that the brewing cereal used is rice.
Yarpivo Ledyanoe (Ice Beer);Yaroslavl, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Yarpivo (Baltika - Baltic Beverages Holding);A cold icebeer should be very delcate but this one was NOT special. It had a strange taste.

Mighty Oak Oscar Wilde;Maldon, Essex, England;Mild Ale;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Very dark and bitter but balanced by a lighter palate for such a dark roast. Good for someone who only drinks dark beer to have on a warm evening. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Iceni Ported Porter;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Porter;Iceni Brewery;Bottle. Black. Lightly roasted malty porter, sourish taste, thin body. Added port not self evident. Soft bittersweet, rather dry, finish. OK. (2008)
Iceni Ported Porter;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Porter;Iceni Brewery;9th July 2008. BBE of Nov 2006! Quite a soft porter. The port doesn�t really present itself other than possibly being responsible for the pronounced fruity tone. Not too dry.
Iceni Ported Porter;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Porter;Iceni Brewery;[500ml bottle from The Real Ale Shop, Priory Farm, Wrentham, Suffolk] Pours deep crimson/black, with no head at all. Big lumps of sediment at bottom. Initially tastes weak and watery before a slight chocolate flavour comes through, followed by a big wallop of damsons and sloes. The sourness of the damsons dominates unpleasantly mid-drink before the intense dryness of the sloes comes through. The aftertaste develops through burnt woody notes into a slightly smokey dryness. In fact dryness in the dominant characteristic. Despite this, I�d agree with others who have said that this should posssibly be classified as a mild rather than a porter. However, despite being quite an interesting and unusual mild I wouldn�t number it amongst my favourites. Still a decent beer though - give it a go if you fancy something different.
Iceni Ported Porter;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Porter;Iceni Brewery;Bottle. Black beer with a lightly roasted and coffee aroma, and a quite tart and vinegar flavour. Overall a weird but OK porter.

Iceni Ported Porter;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Porter;Iceni Brewery;Cask gravity Reading BF 06. Black beer with disappearing beige head. Bit of a thin porter, I certainly didn�t get any port out of it. Some nice tarryness, just not very much else

Hal and Mals Half Moon Light;Jackson, Mississippi, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hal and Mals;Rich, malty lage aroma with earthy notes. Clear American Standard yellow color with tall head. Acidic, well-hopped. Tangy finish, but it loses CO2 and was a little watery.
Hal and Mals Half Moon Light;Jackson, Mississippi, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hal and Mals;Sorry, but this was really shitty. The color was a deep yellow, unlike most light beers, but they somehow managed to take out ALL of the flavor!!!! I actually found one with less taste than michelob ultra!

Shiko Admiral Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Shiko Pivovarennaya Kompaniya;Bottled, Thanks Per. Hazy,orangish brown color, no head at all. Aroma and flavor are very carmelly with notes of noble hops. Some honey flavor. Buttery mouthfeel. Dry hoppy finish. Interesting beer.
Shiko Admiral Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Shiko Pivovarennaya Kompaniya;Bottled. Despite the fact that this is the pale version it is cloudy ornage-brown and has a balsamic toffee aroma. It is sweet, mild and softly malty with mild honeyish finish. Where most Russian beers are unrefined and sluggish this is a subtle, complex beer.
Shiko Admiral Temnoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Shiko Pivovarennaya Kompaniya;Bottled. Like the pale Admiral the label states 6.8%, but their website says 6.2%. Regardless, it pours mahogany coloured and has a pleasant, roasty, lighty chocolatey aroma. It is dryish, mild and lightly fruity with a velvetty, woody finish.
Shiko Gladiator Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Shiko Pivovarennaya Kompaniya;dirty dark-amber colour, absolutely no foam, bready and unfermented malt in the nose, low carbonation, some acidity, dry aftertaste of unfermented malt - tastes like a failed homebrew, it's just totally awful.

Some off notes from molasses. Beautiful color. Murky reddish yellow in color. Head mostly dissipating. Cask smooth. Very good flavor.
Titletown Imperial IPA;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Titletown Brewing Company;A perfectly acceptable IPA, but not a memorable one, at least not on a first sampling.
Ringneck Alt Bier;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;Had this one on tap during a SNOBS tour of the new production brewery. It poured a nice copper color, good hop balance, I think it�s a good rendition of an Alt.
Ringneck Alt Bier;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;on tap @ Brew Kettle, looks amber fore taste is some hop taste, which follows with a mish mash of malts, then boring... just very bland finish to me perhaps that is to style though? Either way was pleasurable to drink.
Ringneck Alt Bier;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;Poured from the tap, color is a muddy amber-brown with a medium light tan head and minimal lacing. Soft chocolate aroma that�s nutty with a hefty roasted sweetness. Medium bodied with a surprisingly assertive bitterness. Very well balanced, rich and creamy. Outstanding flavor, lots of depth. Creamy malts with hints of toasted bread, nuts, burnt chocolate, and caramel. Slightly grassy with plenty of fresh noble hops. Great rendition of a hard to find style.
Ringneck Alt Bier;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;On tap at the Brew Kettle. A deep brown color with a thin off-white head. Nice hoppy aroma, earthy with a caramel malty sweetness. Similar flavor, good mouthfeel and a dry bitter finish. A nice alt.
Ringneck Alt Bier;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;On tap from Brew Kettle. Copper in color, served in a nice mug! (I know, not a big deal, but I think it was my first beer out of a mug!) Hah...Smell of hops and carmel. Taste of hops, caramel, malts and nuts...This one had a slightly hoppy, bitter finish which I didnt entirely care for, but still a very decent beer.
Ringneck Alt Bier;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;On tap @ Brew Kettle: Copper color with an off white head. Aroma, grassy hops, some bready yeast notes. Flavor, soft carbonation, bready, caramel, a light herbal bitterness. Very pleasant beer.
Ringneck Alt Bier;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;Draft at the brewpub. Aroma: Lots of German malt, toasted nuts, and a nice earthy hop note. Very light grape aroma. Appearance: Coppery red in color and fairly clear. Off-white head was full and creamy with good retention. Nice lacing. Flavor: Nice maltiness upfront with some light caramel and toasted nuts. Some spicy/earthy hops into the finish. Bitterness was just enough. Good clean finish. Palate: Medium bodied. Moderate carbonation. Overall: Good, easy to drink beer.
Ringneck Alt Bier;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;"Bomber Bottle, in .25 l straight-sided glass. My sample is just labeled ""Brew Kettle German Style Alt (old) Beer,"" which the bartender said shouldn�t be rated because it was not being commercially served. But this bottle, from the cooler of the BOP section, has the ol� gov�t warning on its label, and other non-Ringneck stuff has rated pretty well, here, so I�ll assume this is the same recipe, except this one may be extract-based. Deep coppery pour with a frothy, persistent eggshell head. A Munich/Vienna malt nose that does taste a little like extract and steeped grains. Smell is bit hard for me with a swollen nose right now, but I can get pleasant hint of a little hops and a very slight smokiness, perhaps a bit nutty, too. I agree that it�s a very clean beer. I had thought I shouldn�t hold on to this much longer because it might not have been filtered, conditioned or pasteurized, but it had held up very well. Ultimately, the taste is a little on the light side for what should be a hoppy German style, but there is nothing displeasing about it."
Ringneck Alt Bier;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;Pours a medium reddish brown with a good, airy head. The aroma is lightly hoppy with a solid caramel maltiness. The flavor is malty with only a little hops.
Ringneck Alt Bier;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;This bottled brew poured a large sized head of fine to medium sized ling lasting off-white colored bubbles that left behind a fair lacing. The body was transparent softly carbonated and caramel brown in color. It had a mild caramel malt aroma. The mouth feel was tingly and somewhat smooth with a caramel malt flavor in the finish. The flavor contained notes of caramel and malt.
Market Street Nut Brown Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Brown Ale;Market Street Brewery & Public House (TN);In the bottle in my microbeer of the month club. On the thin and unimpressive side. Hops seemed non-existent. Their pilsner was much better, even though I'm not much of a pils fan.
Market Street Nut Brown Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Brown Ale;Market Street Brewery & Public House (TN);On tap at Nashville Airport - Medium brown, clear, light to medium body. Virtually no head but did produce some lacing. Aroma hints of hazelnut, molasses, strong coffee, and smoke. Moderately sweet and acidic, major coffee taste with maple and buttery hints. Oily texture, soft carbonation, dry finish with a nutty and mildly hoppy twang on the aftertaste. Overall a little too thin and a little too one-diminsional.

Stood for two days and poured carefully into a pint shaker, but still more cloudy than expected. Hazy brown, with minimal head. Caramel malt aroma with a splash of Cointreau. This is repeated in the flavour, along with dried fruit and nuts. Deceptively thin mouthfeel for the ABV, but as a number of raters point out, this hides its alcohol well, and drinks more like a premium bitter, particularly as there is a hop astringency to the finish.

Town Hall Hefeweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Hazy yellow pour at the brewery with a thick white head and some white lacing. Nice slightly spicy / banana / clove nose. Refreshing, yeasty, slight cracker going on in there and just a hint of acid mixed in with the the banana phenolics.
Town Hall Hefeweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Keg @ Town Hall. Hazy gold with a tight creamy white head. Classic nose. Plenty of banana and clove. Bubblegum sweetness. Bread. Taste is crisp. Bright. Mashed banana and sugared cereal. Some pear juice. Spritzy finish. Light and active on the palate. Decent.
Town Hall Hefeweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Light. Citrus. Wheat. Crisp. Refreshing. Yeast. Bright.
Town Hall Hefeweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Sampled from the tap at the brewpub. Pours a cloudy yellow with a touch of orange and a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a good amount of clove with some sweet wheat and a bit of bread. Flavor has a nice combination of wheat and clove with a nice light earthiness.
Town Hall Hefeweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tap - small foamy head, very hazy orange-yellow color, pretty big shot of typical hefe banana and clove aroma and flavor, sweet wheat backbone, good hefe overall ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Town Hall Hefeweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours cloudy bright yellow with a nice white head. Aroma of banana big time. Taste is a lot of banana and medium thick body. A little one dimensional but decent. Just missing that real German full yeast flavor. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Town Hall Hefeweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. I came in from walking around so I wanted something refreshing. This really hit the spot. A well-made, classic style hefe with iconic yeast. Slightly more bready than a true German hefe, but still worthy. Served in a standard pint glass though.
Town Hall Organicale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Appearance: a clear, coppery reddish hue, with a solid white head, soft and creamy. Aroma: clean to the point of empty, but not without it's good points, still fresh and zesty. On the palate: a neat little blitz of hops storms a quick buzz, but fades soon thereafter. Body is light/medium. Tasty fruitiness (cherries, grapes) pervades the flavor profile, and remains throughout consumption of this very satisfying, and flavorful ale. After the pint was drained, I had one on cask, and it was creamier, lighter, smoother, utterly delicious.
Town Hall Organicale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Clear copper body with small off-white head. Aroma is moderately sweet, caramel, orange, roasty. Taste is mildly sweet, roasted/smokey, with mild bitterness in the aftertaste. Crisp medium body, freshness is noticeable. High carbonation, some acidity.
Augsburger Dark;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Stevens Point Brewery;From old tasting notes. Translucent, deep orange brown color. Huge creamy tan head. Faint toasted malt nose with notes of pine needles. Sweet roasted malt flavor is lightly carbonated. Pleasant hop finish. Nice Belgian lace.
Augsburger Dark;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Stevens Point Brewery;12oz bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a reddish brown with a decent sized head. Aroma of malt, caramel, and slight toffee. Taste of the same. This light to medium bodied brew is pretty bad.
Augsburger Dark;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Stevens Point Brewery;I drank this for years before the craft beer revolution. The label and clear brown color were much more inviting than Bud. Very bland by current craft beer standards.
Augsburger Dark;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Stevens Point Brewery;Pours a weak head with an aroma that smells slightly of malt vinagar. Flavors of molasses, malt, and carbonation. I wasnt to impressed with this. It reminds me of a simple home brew.
Augsburger Dark;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Stevens Point Brewery;From a twist-off green 12 oz. bottle, no freshness date, sampled in a pint glass. Poured a clear reddish hued toffee brown with a small tan head that quickly settled into a fine sudsy lacing. Aromas of prune juice, milk chocolate and caramel, hints of toasted grains. Steady carbonation, more light bodied than medium, smooth and easy drinkability, the tastes can be a bit thin and watery, but overall, and for the cheap price, not the bad, passable, thin chocolate and caramel malts, some sugary maltiness too, the prune juice flavor is more restrained than in the smell, a light toasted graininess emerges in the end, touches of soft hop spiciness in the finish also. For the price, a nice beer for the budget minded, often in the singles rack at the liquor stores in my area.
Augsburger Dark;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Stevens Point Brewery;Chicago trip. Tuesday 12:15. Bottle at Old Chicago by O�Hare. Dark copper. Doppelbock prune aroma. Flavour of raisins, chocolate and prune.
Augsburger Dark;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Stevens Point Brewery;After trying the skunky Augsburger Golden I was a little leary to try this one, but I�ll try anything once. Pours a clear dark brown brew with a fast dissolving off white head. Very little lacing if any. Aroma of roasted nuts, medium malt, caramel, and a touch of toffee. Taste is highly carbonated, nutty, and some corn. Finish is watery with a hint of bitter aftertaste. Though it comes in a green bottle, at least this one was not skunky as the Augsburger Golden. The Augsburger from Huber was better.
Augsburger Dark;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Stevens Point Brewery;A light dunkel. Light roasted aroma and flavor of lightly roasted barley, butter, and nuts. Thin. Not bad for the dollar I paid for it.
Augsburger Dark;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Stevens Point Brewery;Pourts a nice dark brown. Aromas of toffee/caramel malt. Nice soft malty flavor with hints of hops.
Augsburger Dark;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Stevens Point Brewery;In the bottle at the Huber Haus Mug Club wildcat tasting. Dark brown in color with a slightly of-white head. Even though it is in a green bottle, it had not skunked. Mild caramel aroma and an acceptable amount of malt flavor and body for a $4.99 six pack. Minimal hop bitterness.
Legend Imperial Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Legend Brewing Company;"Unique and unexpected aroma of tart black cherry, pineapple sweetness, plum, fresh earth, and does indeed have a bit of a smoky, spicy, meaty quality, along with some roasty malt and fudgy chocolate. Opaque, thick-looking murky black color, lightly coating the glass, with an uneven, subsiding head. Flavor begins with a grainy, roasty coffeeish maltiness, shortly becoming tangy, tart and fruity with notes of prune, cherry and licorice, finishing with a blend of pineapple and grapefruit juice, wood, vinegar, spices, pepper, doughy yeast and faint brown sugar. Dry, grainy palate, full-bodied and lightly warming. Quite challenging and hard to rate. Comes in a ludicrously huge 22 oz. bottle; certainly seems a natural candidate for a 7-10 oz. 'nip' bottle. Only really approachable at 60 F+. Thanks to Kinz for the opportunity to sample this esoteric and exceedingly rare Imperial. I'm also not sure if it's truly enjoyable, but it is kind of fascinating in a strange way. Seems to be perhaps an attempt at an A. Le Coq-style Imperial Stout?"
Legend Imperial Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Legend Brewing Company;"My pleasure to add another beer to the bin. Found this Legend product lurking amongst their standard brewery offerings at the corner wine and beer store. Pours a pitch black. Light barely penetrates around the edges. Rapidly diminishing medium brown head, but leaves a ring around the edge of the glass. Smells like a steak that has been marinating in worcestishire (sp?) and onions. Sort of weird. The flavor is of grilled steak with some A1 sauce splashed over it. I'm not certain if I like this or not. The whopping 11% is pretty cleverly hidden behind the malt attack. Finishes sort of sweet and sour. To the brewer's credit, they were clearly trying to make something different, and they succeeded. I've never tasted anything quite like this before. There are definitely hops there, but I can't figure out what the heck they are. I pretty much try anything my local breweries put out, and I commend the effort at expirementation, but I'm not quite completely on board with this brew. Though I am definitely ""feeling"" this one."
Daves Original Cream Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Cream Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Slightly dryish, with a perfumey accent. Limpid blonde colour. Drinkable, as adjunct-laden ales go, but not recommended.
Daves Original Cream Ale;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Cream Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Quite surprising for me. I thought it would be bad but it is decent and mid range. However there is a SPIDER FLOATING IN MY BEER AND I JUST OPENED IT!!!!!!!!!!!! IF IT WASNT FOR THIS SITE I WOULD HAVE DRANK IT!!!!!! Bob and Doug anyone at least it wasn't a mouse!!!!!!!!!! Okay its okay except for the spider... it was a little one though. Nice pillowy white head that is really large. Somewhat sweet malty, grainy aroma.... Malty sweet head. And slight bitters.. PS I didn't rate the spider... however maybe it's like tequila??? hmmmm Since then I've opened another bottle and it had a hair in it... root and all.... ughghgh... I'm writing a letter to Molson!
Weltons Kid & Bard;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Weltons Beer;Gravity @ Hants Bowman, Dundridge (21/07/05). Malty nose with no suggestion of hops. Off-dry with hop flavours and little maltiness in the taste. Strange but not bad.
Weltons Kid & Bard;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Weltons Beer;Regulation amber colour. Dry, vaguely malty, a touch of earthy hop. Rather thin. A run of the mill session bitter. Nothing wrong with it, but not much to comment on or enthuse about. Cask (gravity dispense), Battersea Beer Festival, February 2005.
Weltons Kid & Bard;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Weltons Beer;Cask at Battersea Beer Festival 2005 (Thursday). Amber and hazy. Fruity aroma with a bit of sulphur. Dry, fruity and a little sweet and some hop bitterness. Gritty.
Weltons Kid & Bard;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Weltons Beer;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, with SilkTork This beer made it clear to me that a mans liver should not be wasted on crap beer. When there�s lots to sample, then there is much work to be done. Despite the advice of SilkTork, I heroically pushed on with the sampling of all beer by the pint. Trouble was that this beer was very ordinary. So ordinary that I laboured through it for what seemed and eternity, whilst SilkTork was splitting his sides at my dispare. We had a blinder that night at the Wenlock (see the last beer of the night - Mahrs Br�u by SilkTork). Lots and lots of nothing in a glass. Also sampled cask fresh at the Black Jug Horsham. Bright amber coloured body, sudsy grey head. Strong session bitter, lip smacking and generous. Wonderful bitter indeed, pulled on especially for my thirsty lips. Scored 3.3
Weltons Kid & Bard;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Weltons Beer;June, 2003: Wenlock Arms. Beer has a ripe banana aroma with the banana continuing into the flavour. That�s the best that can be said for this watery session bitter - thin body, light hops and a banana skin waved in the general direction of the liquid to provide some kind of taste. Spiesy, the poor bastard, drank a whole pint of this. [1.8] Jan, 2005: Black Jug, Horsham. This is the dry hopped Black Jug version. Chocolate and coffee notes in a gulpable session bitter. Body is quite light, bordering on lean, but flavours are inviting. Acidic aroma. While at the bar a customer asked for a sample, saying he�d heard it was a bad beer. After the sample he ordered a different beer. Clearly a beer with some character! [2.7]

Limonaderie du Ventoux Biere au Petit Epeautre;Sault, France;Traditional Ale - Other;Limonaderie du Ventoux;Bottle. Cloudy dirty pale colour. Faint aroma of orange vomit. Thin watery beer with a dirty dish-water flavour. Some hints of orange peel. Not very good. The brewery is actually a lemonade maker who is branching out into beer production to make ends meet. There is an encouraging growth of traditional breweries in the south of France, but this one just doesn't cut the mustard. We popped in to visit, but the brewer was too busy bottling lemonade to sell us any of his beers. His stuff is, however, available in the major supermarkets in the area.
Limonaderie du Ventoux Biere au Petit Epeautre;Sault, France;Traditional Ale - Other;Limonaderie du Ventoux;Medium hazy gold-yellow with medium shortish lasting off white head. Light yeasty and spicey grassy aroma. V low carbonation with medium soft to watery body. Mild hops and some faint wheat beer character even though the label says barley is the only grain. An interesting traditional local brew. Probably quite refreshing after you cycle to the brewery or sitting in a nearby cafe watching the Tour de France go by.
Great Waters Mississippi Mild;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Great Waters Brewing;This is not what I was expecting, the name eludes to mud. I bought this beer because of the Bottle (awsome package) and I was expecting somthing more like a gueinness, or may be that it would seperate in the glass.
Great Waters Mississippi Mild;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Great Waters Brewing;"Sample at the brewpub. Another mild...hmm, is this going to be the one? Darkish amber, a bit cloudy, delicious very sweet caramel-vanilla nose; oaky flavors, bit on the thin side and papery towards the end. Nope, wasn�t the one."

Great Waters Mississippi Mild;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Cask. Very nice brown color medium head. Aroma has slight malt overtones to it. Taste is malty and a little tart on the end. For a beer so thin, the malt profile is incredible.
Great Waters Mississippi Mild;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Great Waters Brewing;"On Cask: Solid brown with highlights of dark maple syrup, a one finger high head of creamy, liquid oatmeal-looking head of creamy color sits atop, lacing in thick patches, quite a good looking brown. Smell is mild, roasty, clean, lightly tangy and a bit faint. Taste is mild tangy roastyness of malts, a bit of grains and a nice twingy-like bitterness into the finish. Feel is light to medium bodied with a touch of grainyness throughtout, a tad to thin and watery in the overall feel. This brown looked amazing, but came up a little short in every other aspect. Their Chalk Board states ""...as rich and dark as the river itself"" I don't know if thats a good thing, cuz just a few days ago they found a dead body just down by the sewer treatment plant, it was in the Pioneer Press. So I told em they may want to rethink the slogan for that one."

Not sure if this is the exact one as no one has rated it in two years! They said it was there Hefe beer, but i dont see it listed on their website either, but oh well. To sweet for my liking. To banana-ey smelling, and i hate bananers!

Great Waters Hefeweizen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Great Waters Brewing;Cloudy golden color with a monster head. Wheat with some yeast in the nose. The wheat hits your tongue like a ton of bricks. The yeast manages to dissipate before it makes much impact on the taste. Citrusy notes as well (lemon) as well as some hay. Quite a nice Hefe.
Great Waters Hefeweizen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Great Waters Brewing;Color is a soild lighter gold, pretty hazy, with a whiteish head about a finger high and leaves spotty lace. Smell is light of wheat and yeastyness, quite fresh, some lemony spritzyness but faint. Taste is more of the same, wheat, oats, light yeastyness, lemony cirus, pretty short lived comparativily speaking. Feel is right on but a watery lateness shows through with a touch of soury bitterness. Not bad, good for a summer evening or afternoon lunch, such as I did, to sit back on the patio and enjoy.
Great Waters Hefeweizen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Great Waters Brewing;Cloudy golden with small white head. Aroma is intense banana, some wheat and a hint of clove.

Great Waters Scottish Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Scottish Ale;Great Waters Brewing;"Called ""SCOTCH ALE"" when I was there, but was definitely (abv and body-color/density) a scottish. Cloudy coffee brown. Head stays on (but thin) through a few sips. Light clover-hop effect in aroma and flavor (inseparable). Finish a touch bitter and syrupy. Some nuttiness present. Greasy flat sticky mouthfeel that needs more time to mellow the amber malts with the hops and scottish yeast--reminds me of a homebrewed Scottish 80/- I opened ahead of its ready date. I couldn�t finish this one, though I tried. On cask."
Great Waters Scottish Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Scottish Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Cask-conditioned: Well.....beyond its lovely sheeting cascade and cloudy, pale brown color this was a big disappointment. Along with its awesome cascade of fast, light yellowy sheets flying up the sides of the glass like the locusts of the apocolypse, the head got to about two fingers high, is white and lumpy with divets and some unclinging lace sheets that faded fairly fast. Smell, well there wasn't much there at all, a big swirl and a big wiff produced a barely noticable sweet malt. Taste is very mild at best, with a very watery sweet malt and mild hop thats a bit bitter sweet. Feel is light and watery clean and a bit gritty and slightly sweetish but mild and played out, one nice highlight was a slight smokey sense that showed up very late in the finish. This was not all that enjoyable, needs alot help for a Scottish ale.
Great Waters Scottish Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Scottish Ale;Great Waters Brewing;(cask) Hazy dark copper with small tan head.

Traverse Torch Lake Light Beer;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Traverse Brewing;Golden color with small white head. A typical light beer light in the hops and in taste. Alittle fruity taste comes through but not much.

Sainsbury's Munich Style Festival Lager;Holborn, Greater London, England;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sainsbury's;330ml bottle. Pours orange with lively carbonation and no head. Looks a bit like a fizzy drink! Aroma is light and standard lager fare. The taste is malty with a good hop balance coming through in the long finish. Feels quite heavy for a beer of this strength. Good overall.
Sainsbury's Munich Style Festival Lager;Holborn, Greater London, England;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sainsbury's;Bottle 330ml bottle, from Sainsburys. Poured a real dark bronze colour.

Sainsbury's Munich Style Festival Lager;Holborn, Greater London, England;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sainsbury's;[i]Bottle, 12-07-07 thanks to Glen for this. [/i] Amber in colour, bit malty and some sweetness but quite flavoursome with a nice hoppy note, served at room temperature as well which seems to bring out a few more flavours, quite nice really.
Sainsbury's Munich Style Festival Lager;Holborn, Greater London, England;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sainsbury's;Aroma is lager malts a bit grainy, some german veriety of hop giving grassy notes. Taste is quite full on, the grainy lager malts are all over you, however there are some hops in here which balance it reasonably.
Sainsbury's Munich Style Festival Lager;Holborn, Greater London, England;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sainsbury's;Not bad as far as it goes. The strong malt is good with a lingering bitter finish. Unfortunately, after this it has a lingering cloying quality that takes away from the beer over all. As far as Meantime goes I�d stick with their IPA or chocolate stout.
Sainsbury's Munich Style Festival Lager;Holborn, Greater London, England;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sainsbury's;Bottled, filtered, 600ml. Gold amber colour with white head. Malty, sweetish beer with a thicker mouthfeel than expected. Toffee caramel note in the background with a biscuity malt. Some lemon, citrus on the finish. Nice easy drinking beer.

Tugboat Vienna Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Clear dark brown body with some red light. Candy sugar and leaf-like aroma, lots of lacing on the glass.... with a big ass hop bite. Of course, Tugboat hops the hell out of everything, and sometimes it�s a nice touch, something different than the same old vienna you might see. The malts flavors are sweet and roasty, the body is smooth and theres a touch of sweet strawberries in the finish... bread, berries and peaches are formed from the hops used in this one. Pretty good.
Tugboat Vienna Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Dark amber with a white head. Aroma is biscuity with some sweetness and earthiness. Flavor is strong malt sweetness and bottom-fermented characteristics. Medium light body and very dry finish.

Tugboat Vienna Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Light hazy gold with some sticky head & light lacing. The aroma is malty with some wheat & banana, very citrusy with hops and some belgian qualities. The flavor is tangy with bitter and sourness. Finishes tangy, weird finish. Not too bad though.
Tugboat Vienna Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tugboat Brewing Co.;Pours an amber color with a nice fluffy white head. The Vienna is just like TB�s summer ale, sharing a fruity, sourness, grapefruity thing that is overwhelming in my opinion. This brew had a bit more bitterness than the summer ale, but not all that great.
Tugboat Vienna Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tugboat Brewing Co.;An all around even beer. Defined hop presence with a spiciness- not sure if from the hops or not. Still Tug, still good. Moderate body.
Boscos Iggy Schwarzbier;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);On tap @ Bosco�s in Little Rock. A true black lager with a nice white head and great lacing. Roasted malts dominate the aroma with slightly sweet molasses and bready notes. Taste is rich., smooth and creamy with a great roasted maltiness, a slight hops bitter and even a slight coffee flavor. Very nice black lager.
Boscos Iggy Schwarzbier;Memphis, Tennessee, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Boscos Brewing Company (Roma Pomodori);On tap in Nashville - Opaque black with a small off-white head. Good lacing. Medium-bodied. Major characteristic on the nose is very smokey and roasted malt. Hints of pumpernickel, dark chocolate, mild coffee, spruce, and tawny port. Very complex and if the aroma was a little stronger, would have given it a 10. Good hoppy twang balanced the heavy malt sweetness, slightly vinous and smokey on the palate. Oily and lively mouthfeel. Dry and crisp finish. A rare excellent American version of this style.
5 Seasons Djokker Wit;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;5 Seasons Brewing Company;This poured a cloudy yellow color with a moderate head. The aroma contains citrus and coriander. The flavor is citrus, cloves, and biscuit. Overall a very nice witbier!

5 Seasons Djokker Wit;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Hazy and cloudy in the pour, with a small dollop of white head. Nice spicy aroma, that really lingers right on into the flavor, which brings forth clove and coriander, with some banana notes on the tail, slightly astringent alcohol bite in the finish that I was not expecting, but overall nicely balanced. A great patio beer for spring

5 Seasons Djokker Wit;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;5 Seasons Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Very light hazy golden coloring with a small white head. Very heavily citrus aroma. The flavor was dominated by lemon, but there was a good bit of malty mouthfeel here that kind of threw me off. I�ve had better and I�ve had worse.
5 Seasons Djokker Wit;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Clear, lemon yellow body and a pillowy white head. Floral, lime coriander in the aroma with a hint of orange peel and light clove-like phenols. Phenols come through more prominently in the flavor and become a touch too plastic. Dry with moderate bitterness, but the impression is more orange peel than hops. A solid wit and refreshing summer beer.

Hertog Jan Hoogstpersoonlijk;Arcen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Bottle: Oh yeah, I totally forgot about this beer, until I saw it here. Remember it tasted well, better than what the market usually sell. Nothing that superior, still nice but don�t need more. A bit watery and just a hint of hops, this is not close to being tops. Now it�s not available anymore, that�s what you get for a beer so mediocre�
Hertog Jan Hoogstpersoonlijk;Arcen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);An orange beer with a white head. The aroma is hoppy and the flavor sweet malty. Quite a boring beer from Hertog Jan - the best thing was the fine wrapping.
Hertog Jan Hoogstpersoonlijk;Arcen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);I can only say, don't judge a beer by the color of its skin!! Nice wrapping but a quite boring beer. Pours a clear golden body with a white head. Aroma is yeasty and malty with some woody dryness. Flavor is watery and thin, dry and somewhat citrusy.
Hertog Jan Hoogstpersoonlijk;Arcen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);This is a very boring beer in a very nice packaging. The 75cL bottle comes in a stylish black and golden bag. The beer is very thin and boring.
Hertog Jan Hoogstpersoonlijk;Arcen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Golden colour. White, medium-sized, rocky head that leaves a nice lace. Perhaps it's the appearence of the bottle+folder but I believe this is quality... Nice malt and hop presence, long finish. Slight fruitiness (from the top-fermentation?).
Hertog Jan Hoogstpersoonlijk;Arcen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Fresh hoppy and floral aroma. Pilsener looks, better head. Taste is floral and hoppy, some malts. Some bitterness. Fresh palate.
Hertog Jan Hoogstpersoonlijk;Arcen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Just a hint of hops and caramel in the aroma. Caramelly flavor with a slight hoppiness and some malty sweetness. Hint of citrus. Subtle flavor, nothing really stands out. But the beer has enough to be worthwile tasting.
Hertog Jan Hoogstpersoonlijk;Arcen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Clear golden color, short but lasting head. Hoppy, flowery aroma. Quite sweet taste. Easy to drink, refreshing palate.
Hertog Jan Hoogstpersoonlijk;Arcen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Clear golden colour, average head, diminishing. Fresh aroma, bit hoppy. Flavour of the HJ pilsener and some additional belgian ale. Refreshing and very easy to drink, but not very special.
Hertog Jan Hoogstpersoonlijk;Arcen, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arcense Bierbrouwerij (AB-InBev);Light peach aroma. Golden color, white head, good lace. Light, refreshing, hoppy, light sweet, fruity. Like a combination of Hertog Jan pils and Hertog Jan Meibock. Light bitter finish.
Hopdaemon Incubus;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;"September 9, 2017 - handpull cask - at The Rake (Borough Market). Clear, bright and refractive amber-gold with an attractive off-white lasting head. Tangy acidic/alpha bitter aroma - nice and malty; taste follows, definite fuggles character - just a solid straightforward bitter, nice to find one for a change - and at The Rake! Chewy, solid body, light carbonation, not too grainy or funky in the finish - I would have this again for sure."
Tio Ramon Pilsener;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;Poured up at the Ahwetukee Arriba�s where they have around a 5 barrel system in use. It looks clear gold with near bright white head. The aroma offers up bits of floral hops, sweet malts, grainy malts and a sense of yeastiness. The taste is similar with floral hops, grainy malts, some sweetness and sort of a sense of floral hop influenced yeastiness. At the edges I get thin ribbons of acidic lemon like notes. Overall this has a thin body, a modest level of flavor and as such is a decent hot weather brew.
Tio Ramon Pilsener;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;(On draught at arriba scottsdale). Pours a clear golden color with thin white head. Aroma has cracker, bread, malt. Taste has some sweetness as well as some bitterness. A bit metallic, but the bitterness more than makes up for it. Medium bodied with a bitter, dry finish. Not bad at all.
Tio Ramon Pilsener;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;Tap: Was served with a lime attched to top of glass. So you will get a lime citus aroma. Yellow body color with white head, some lacing. Flavor hade a lime and lemon citrus to it. Was a good beer to go along with eating chips and salsa.
Tio Ramon Pilsener;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;Cloudy yellow with a very small head. Aroma is lemon and citrus with a slightly bitter hops, lemon and citrus flavor. Not bad.
Tio Ramon Pilsener;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;(tap) I tasted very little difference between this and the amber actually, though it is lighter in color. The more I drank this one, the less I liked it.
Tio Ramon Amber;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;(On draught at the scottsdale location). Pours a clear amber color with off-white head. Aroma has caramel malts, bread, cracker. Taste is sweet with some bitterness. Thin with an oily texture. Finish is bitter. Not a bad beer.
Tio Ramon Amber;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;Another travesty in brewing...again with the same odd flavor profile as the Bock (perhaps they were infected). Dark copper color with a 1/4 inch head that quickly turned into a ring before disappearing altogether. Caramel, toffee, and an off-putting spice. Pass.
Tio Ramon Amber;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;The lime definitely overpowered the beer. But that�s partially because the beer was fairly plain and bland. (Of course the food is STELLAR, but that�s a seperate rating) A very dark beer for an amber. Some caramel and citrus characteristics (citrus was probably more lime than beer itself). I thought it was better than most, and this one had a little more bitter to it than most ambers. I felt this one was a bock for a brief moment.
Tio Ramon Amber;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;I would have to hink the lime severve with this one took away most of the main charistics of this beer. Other than the the body was amber in color it�s aroma and flavor was also like the pilsner. Good beer anyway with dinner.
Tio Ramon Amber;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;On tap at the Ahwatukee location. Dark caramel/ amber with a smallish head. Aroma was sweet malt and cinnamon. Flavor was a spicy with a sweet caramel finish. Good refreshing beer.
Tio Ramon Amber;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;(tap) This is one of 3 beers brewed by this Mexican restaurant with several locations in the Phoenix area. The amber was a murky brown which smelled mainly of the lime that was placed on the top of the glass, and which kinda tasted like the lime as well. It definitely didn't have much flavor. I had the Bock and Pilsener before but i shall rate them later when I have had them again.
Tio Ramon Bock;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;Draft in Glendale. Not impressed. Looks and almost tastes like really old cola. Flat. Overly sugary. Beginner�s homebrew level. (#5977, 5/25/2015)
Tio Ramon Bock;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;On tap at the Awhatukee location pours up amber to copper in color supporting a light tan head. The aroma offers up caramel malts, sweet and seemingly slightly tart dark fruity esters like a bit of a hard candy like sensation. The taste is pretty rich and sweet with sugary caramel malts, some sweet dark fruity esters and a touch of earthiness. I wasn�t expecting this to be as rich and yummy as it is. I�ll sure have it again my next visit.
Tio Ramon Bock;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;Dark brown pour. No real head. Aroma is barely there. A bit malty. Funky grainy. Flavor is odd. A bit skunky. A bit tart. But not as bad as it sounds. Weird.
Tio Ramon Bock;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;This was truly a terrible experiment in brewing...cola-colored and with minimal carbonation. Aroma was quite sweet with an odd spice added to it...couldn�t really place it. Funky, sugary, and not at all refreshing. Avoid this one.
Tio Ramon Bock;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;(Draft at Casa Arriba, Scottsdale, AZ) Pours a cloudy dark brown body with a small beige head. Aroma of molasses, brown malt, and caramel. Flavor of toasted malt, molasses, and some dark fruit.
Tio Ramon Bock;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;A classic dark body color. Goes down smooth. Truly refreshing. Zero aftertaste.
Tio Ramon Bock;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;Tap : This one had an aroma of spices. Dark body color with of white head. Had a sweet caramel and spice added in to the flavor. Left somewhat of a dry aftertaste. Good Beer.
Tio Ramon Bock;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Casa Arriba Brewing Company;Ahwatukee location. Dark red amber with a light crisp aroma of caramel and spice. Flavor is sweet, spicy with a yeast finish. Not bad.
ND Ridder Streekbier;Boezinge, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Leroy;Typical Belgian pils, yet even sweeter and more lifeless than most. To be honest, the body and flavour are not bad at all due this abv, but that makes it all the more a shame that it has no more hops and characterless fermentation aromas. (25cl bottle from Prik & Tik Leuven)
ND Ridder Streekbier;Boezinge, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Leroy;Bottle @ home. Clear colour, white foam. Crispy and bitter beer. Light and weak, refreshing and easy drinkable. Not a bad low alcohol beer!
ND Ridder Streekbier;Boezinge, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Leroy;Pours clear blonde, not much of a head. Smell is crispy, malty, a lot like a lager to be fair. Is this low fermentation ? Taste is surprisingly bitter. Still tastes a lot like a lager, but the bitterness this one has is nowhere what you would expect from a beer like this. Of course, the body and the back don�t stand up to this strong taste, but given the abv, i�d say thats only reasonable. Kinda good, for what it is !
ND Ridder Streekbier;Boezinge, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Leroy;25cl, best before 01.15. The beer starts malty fresh, hints of grain, slightly smooth. Not too deep but fullbodied. Grainy-smooth and fresh aftertaste with quite lots of bitterness. Very nice.
ND Ridder Streekbier;Boezinge, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Leroy;27/XI/14 - 25cl bottle @ Gent Horeca Expo - BB: X/2015 (2014-1410) Clear pale, very pale yellowish beer, creamy white head, little stable, bit adhesive. Aroma: lots of grains, malty, hay, bit sweet, sugary, some almonds. MF: soft carbon, medium to light body. Taste: lots of hay, grains, malty, little sweet, bit off. Aftertaste: bitter, metallic, lots of grains, cow fodder, more metallic.

ND Ridder Streekbier;Boezinge, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Leroy;Bottle: Served in a Chouffe glass: Loud plop. Clear yellow body with medium to bigger sized lively and quickly demolishing airy white head on top. Aromas of malts, corn, soap, some hay, grains, spices and a hint of hops. Flavours of malts, herbs, grass, some hops, bitters, grains, hay, light spiced, corn, green plant ish tones, some light floral tones and a sprinkle of something yeasty. Aftertaste is a mix of grains, herbs, grass, malts, bitters, hay, plants. Medium carbo, creamy mouthfeel, low to medium bodied and a creamy texture. For 2.25%ABV this is a good beer.
ND Ridder Streekbier;Boezinge, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Leroy;"Brown 25cl bottle, best before Nov 2010, poured into a �La Chouffe� stemmed tulip glass and reviewed on 6 Oct 2010. Didn�t know what to expect, I got this in Brugge without the aid of my glasses: memo to me; wear glasses when buying new beers and check alcohol levels! Very lager/pilsner like in apperance, light golden body with the regular snowy white head. The aroma was again typical pilsner/lager, grains, with hints of yeast and hops. Dry and boring flavours, neither bitter or sweet. As thin as a beer gets in the body stakes, but it is only 2.25%ABV so one shouldn�t expect too much taste or richness. All in all, I got what was on the label (just couldn�t see it without my glasses)."
ND Ridder Streekbier;Boezinge, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Leroy;Bottle. Frothy white good mostly deminishing head. Pale yellow colour. moderate malty and light hoppy bad grainy aroma. Light bitter not pleasent flavor. Short finish. Watery palate.
ND Ridder Streekbier;Boezinge, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Leroy;dry hoppy aroma,golden pale, clear, white foam, medium bitterness, light body, dry hoppy finish.
Wylam Magic (Summer Magic);Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wylam Brewery;Had this bitter in the Three Judges, Glasgow October 2005. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale amber in colour with a thin white head. Sweet aroma of raisin fruit in the malty aroma. Thin but refreshing mouthfeel and good lacing. Juicy pale malt gives a digestive biscuit base with slight raisin fruit noted. Hop resins give a strong aromatic , spicy flavour to the short bitter aftertaste. Finish is slightly bitter with citrusy flavours in the mouth. A decent session Golden Ale.

White Marsh They Made Me Do It Blueberry Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;White Marsh Brewing Company (Red Brick Station Brew Pub);Even though there were blueberries floating in it..

I�m not sure if the 2009 was just a bad batch, but it seems others enjoyed it in past years much more then I did this summer.
White Marsh They Made Me Do It Blueberry Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;White Marsh Brewing Company (Red Brick Station Brew Pub);Draft at the 2009 MD Spring Fest. One of the better blueberry beers I�ve had. Deep orange-brown-purple color. Looks filtered. Dry and fruity, with no syrup taste. Excellently smooth. Garnished with real blueberries at the brewery.
White Marsh They Made Me Do It Blueberry Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;White Marsh Brewing Company (Red Brick Station Brew Pub);Reddish copper color with a spoonful of blueberries added during the pour. Tart and tangy blueberry flavor, obviously. Very drinkable and surprisingly good, although I drank this after a hoppy beer, and I think that bitterness was still lingering on my palate.

McMenamins Firefly K�lsch;Portland, Oregon, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Draft at the White Eagle, pours clear yellow with small white head. Sweet aroma of malts and honey, citrusy and slightly peppery aroma. Floral. Flavor is light and malty and pretty sweet for its light color and body, definitely citrusy and maybe a slight hint of anise and hop, no bitterness. Very drinkable but not much to it.
McMenamins Firefly K�lsch;Portland, Oregon, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Draught. Poured cloudy yellow with almost no head.

McMenamins Firefly K�lsch;Portland, Oregon, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;"On tap at the Kennedy School location. Pours a cloudy pale golden color with a thin layer of fizzy white head. Some fruity yeast greets the nose at first, bringing out some aromas of banana and light pear; not the expectation for a kolsh, but pleasant nonetheless. A touch of crisp, lemony, wheaty acidity adds a clean refreshing touch. Light bodied, gently carbonated mouthfeel. Served a bit on the warm side for the style, which perhaps accentuates some of the yeast aromatics noticed. Clean, refreshing lemony wheat flavor with a touch of lavender hops. Finishes dry, with a wave of hop bitterness that has a harsh stalky, stemmy quality and inhibits the drinkability somewhat."
McMenamins Firefly K�lsch;Portland, Oregon, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;[Tap - Hillsdale Brew Pub] A golden thing color with a nice head. Good hop aroma and I loved the flavor this was a good summer brew. I�ll have anohter as I sit here and type.
McMenamins Firefly K�lsch;Portland, Oregon, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;@ Bagdad Theater, Portland (not sure who they�re partnered with). Hazy straw colour. Crisp, herbal hop aroma. The malts are fresh on the palate (bready) as are the hops (earthy, herbal). Well-balanced, as close to authentic Kolsch as I�ve had in the US...though the reference is a bit strange as fireflies (while a summer feature they may be) do not exist west of the Rockies.
McMenamins Firefly K�lsch;Portland, Oregon, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Draught at Boon�s Treasury, Salem, OR.

Australian Brewing Oz Lager;Little River, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Australian Brewing Corporation;From the can (that looked more like CZ Lager than Oz Lager) - It poured a clear golden body with little carbonation that somehow managed to support a large creamy head regardless. Laces well, too. The aroma is grainy with a touch of apple and a bit of tin. The start of the taste is a fairly decent sweet malt, but the tinniness comes forward and remains for the finish. Sal�s Beverage World, Elmhurst, IL
Australian Brewing Oz Lager;Little River, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Australian Brewing Corporation;Nice golden colour with frothy white head. Taste is clear and smooth.

Australian Brewing Oz Lager;Little River, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Australian Brewing Corporation;440ml can, 4 pack. First tried it out of the can and tasted corn and can. Tried the last can in a glass. Rich head and attractive in the glass. Full mouth feel and an aspect that raised it above my first impression. The flavour reminded me of a Strong Belgian Ale yeast. The website says this beer is coming soon so I am not exactly sure what the goal of the brewer was. I think they missed but i gave them a point or two for the effort.
McCoys Maibock;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;McCoy's Public House;An okay maibock, though not anything special. Has some checmially character with quite a bit of light fruit and sugary sweetness. Tried in 2010 for the first time.
McCoys Maibock;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;McCoy's Public House;Tap at the brewpub in KC. Clear golden pour. Sparkling, higher carbonation.

McCoys Ginger Shandy;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Radler / Shandy;McCoy's Public House;Tap. Golden with small head. Another simple, but decent beer from these guys. Light body, mild ginger, and a bit of sweetness. Refreshing.
McCoys Ginger Shandy;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Radler / Shandy;McCoy's Public House;I actually enjoyed this. One has to remember that this is a Shandy and not an overly complex beer. The aroma was of strong ginger. The color was like, well, Ginger Ale. The mouth feel was highly carbonated and crisp. Ginger is the flavor that hits you first followed by sweetness with a little spice. This borders the line of a wine cooler but can still be classified as a beer. Refreshing.
McCoys Ginger Shandy;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Radler / Shandy;McCoy's Public House;Hazy yellow with a pure white head. Good, strong ginger aroma and even better ginger flavir accented by quite a bit of sweetness. I enjoy this quite well. A sweet ginger beer.

McCoys Ginger Shandy;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Radler / Shandy;McCoy's Public House;Draft sample at Microfest 2012. Of the four, I�m not sure why I reached for this one.

Notes of lemon citrus, ginger- and a lot of both- along with sugar, and some bread. Light-bodied, with high carbonation and a crisp, sweet, gingery mouthfeel. Spicy and sweet at the same time, refreshing. Not bad, actually.

Liefmans Fruitesse Kriek;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);"The kriek in this series, made from 2003 till Riva went bankrupt and fortunately not restored by Moortgat so far; very sweet, syrupy kriek, tasting and smelling of not much else but overtly sweet cherry extracts. I am glad the trend of light, witbier-based, onedimensionally sweet fruit beers seems to have passed a bit now."

Liefmans Fruitesse Kriek;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);This beer pours a hazy reddish-brown color with a medium foamy off-white head that recedes quickly to an outer ring. Spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of cherries and malt. Light-bodied with flavors of tart cherry, malt and roasted nuts. The finish is mildly tart with a short cherry aftertaste. Average overall.
Liefmans Fruitesse Kriek;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);September 2011. Bottle. Sweet and artificial cherry aromas. Dark red with a pink fizzy head. Cherry and sticky flavors. Easy one to forget.
Liefmans Fruitesse Kriek;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours a red beer with a small pink not long lasting head. It smells like cherry, much cherry. Very very sweet. The taste is very juicy. Cherry lemonade , very sweet and little sour. It has a thin body, watery texture and a lively carbo. This one is way to sweet and missing the alcohol.

Bryggerimesteren Gull Pils;Egersund, Norway;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berentsens Brygghus;1500 ml plastic bottle. Golden body with a white head. A little but sweet malty aroma. Flavor has a relatively OK maltyness, sweet and actually some hops. Could be worse.
Bryggerimesteren Gull Pils;Egersund, Norway;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berentsens Brygghus;1,5 l plastic bottle. Gull Pils indeed. Very pale, faint smell of vomit, a hint of boiled carrot. Truly bad, I�m happy to tell you that this beer only has local distribution.
Bryggerimesteren Gull Pils;Egersund, Norway;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berentsens Brygghus;1500 ml plastic bottle. Deep golden colour and crystal clear. White fluffy head with some coarse bubbles. Crisp noble hops, mostly saaz. Classic pilsener aroma at first. Smooth texture as the carbonation is quite mellow. Somewhat sweet malty flavours. Little hops in the flavour. Clean maltiness, but it is a bit too thin. Little aftertaste, but it is a bit sugary and grassy. After a while it builds up a cloying oxidized aroma.
Bryggerimesteren Gull Pils;Egersund, Norway;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berentsens Brygghus;Medium white fine-laced head. Greenish yellow body. Peppery hop aroma with rubber notes and some light malts. Taste is light, clean grass, faintly sweetish, with bitter, papery aftertaste. The bitter, papery taste lingers unpleasantly. An OK pilsener, but spoiled by that aftertaste. (1.5l plastic bottle.)
Bryggerimesteren Gull Pils;Egersund, Norway;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berentsens Brygghus;Plastic bottle. Golden clear colour with no head. Weak aroma of maltness with notes of sulfo. Light flavour of malt and ends up watery.

Saint-Donat Blonde;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;330ml bottle (One Pint Pub, Helsinki, Belgian Beer Weeks 2004) Aroma was lightly spicy and yeasty. Spicy and hoppy taste, but tarnished by being clearly alcoholic, not well hidden at all.
Saint-Donat Blonde;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;Bottle: Poured a hazy yellow straw color with a bubbly white head. The aroma is a spicy and malty. Taste is a bit rusty metal and malt, finishes spicy with a bread yeast finish.
Saint-Donat Blonde;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;7% ABV Cloudy blond color, with a lot of floating objects. The smell is strange, with glue and plastic. Thin mouthfeel, very simple Belgian Ale, some spices and some sweetness. Not good.
Saint-Donat Blonde;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;Bright yellow superhazy. Stinks like a belgian strong coriander spicy golden. These are all starting to smell alike to me but this one smells a bit like overripe alefruit if you know what I mean. decent whitehead. A little bittuer/trashy ripe taste for a belgian golden, otherwise normal, a bit more fruity perhaps, a little heavier in the palate. no loss that it is, I heard, deleted.
Saint-Donat Blonde;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;This golden ale poured with a modest white head. The flavor is sweet with a slightly bitter finish, and is quite balanced. This bottle did not suffer from the infection found in other batches, and was quite drinkable.
Saint-Donat Blonde;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;My bottle claims 7% ABV only Unclear orange-straw coloured beer with irregular, dirty-white thick head. Very alcoholic nose, as some spirit, some maltwhisky features. Very spicey as well, characteristic, but I�m unable to pin it down. Honey too. Strange spicey taste, at the verge of sourishness, and mannah-like flavour. Some little residual sweetness, white bread and some alcohol. Vegetable flavour retronasal. Alcoholwarming, little burning feel, medium bodied and certain slickness. Infected, I�m sure. As was their first try, which I dismissed out of hand. This might well be their last, and not much is changed, �t would seem...
Saint-Donat Blonde;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;Cloudy, light yellow with a fine, egg-white head that cloys to the glass. It looks very much like a wit. Aroma is more weizen-like with clove and banana notes, but coriander brings me back to Belgium. Coriander and yeastiness are dominant flavours, surprisingly dry throughout, spicy finish. Medium bodied. An excitingly different Belgian wit.

Saint-Donat Brune;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;My bottle, bought at Beer Mania, was sadly contaminated too, a shame as the fruity twiggy chocolate malt aroma was promising, but strong acidic cidery notes cut straight through to ruin the the palate and finish and I ended up pouring down the sink.

Saint-Donat Brune;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;(Bottled, 7.5% ABV, aged sample from BeerMania, thanks TBone!) Dark, hazy brown with a small, but firm and very lasting head (no lace like in the Ambr�e, though). Aroma of caramely-licoricey malt, dark fruit, some anise. Dried-fruity flavor with lightly roasted, sour malts, some caramel, tart oud bruin finish. Medium-bodied, dry palate with quite high, but smooth carbonation. Very mixed reviews it seems, but I liked this one. Pleasantly dried out with ageing - or maybe it was like this from the start. Anyway - I�d like to have another one, if the brewery still existed.

Piece Collars and Cuffs Blonde Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;On tap at Piece. Poured clear paler golden with a short cap of white head. The aroma was soft with bready and honey notes accented by dusty lemon zest and floral hoppage.. pleasant. The flavor had more of the honey with grassy and lemon bitterness.. softer and well-balanced, but the sweetness was too focused on the honey.. bitterness was light. Lighter-bodied and very dry on the palate with a refreshing finish.

Piece Collars and Cuffs Blonde Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;I had originally ordered Piece for delivery but they told me they had the Jockey Full of Bourbon on tap so I ran down there to pick it up myself. Unfortunately, they lied and the only beer they had on tap that I hadn�t had was this one. Pours a cloudy blond with a nice white head. Aroma of lemon and some spices. Goes down easy, does almost taste like a wheat. Not a bad beer, but I was just so pumped to try the bourbon one :(
Piece Collars and Cuffs Blonde Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;This was good but boring. A little cloudier than I expected. Pretty lemony, tastes sort of like a wheat bear. Not a whole lot of hops, but I guess thats the idea. This would be good if I was doing a marathon of drinking, but just not enough going on to excite me.
Piece Collars and Cuffs Blonde Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Poured a cloudy yellow color. Aroma of spices and banana. Tasted of some spices, and sweet malt, not much hops of any kind.
Piece Collars and Cuffs Blonde Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Draft at Piece. Decent looking beer, yellow with a small but lasting foamy head. Nice malt profile is both light and sweet, delicate and grainy. Magnificent.
Piece Collars and Cuffs Blonde Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Piece Brewery & Pizzeria;Tap at Piece: Clean light gold hue with a fading fizzy head. The aroma has notes of grains, biscuity malt, apple esters, grassy hops and a hint of soap. The taste is pretty much what I expected, mild pale malts and light-handed bitterness in this session ale. A bit musty tasting too. The mouth feel is sprite and light-bodied. A ho-hum ale, drinkable with pizza but nothing you need to go outta way to get.
Huyghe Black Stout;Melle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Huyghe;Malty. Caramel, licorice notes. Very light bitterness. Deep copper brown clear with thin tan head.

Huyghe Black Stout;Melle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Huyghe;Bottled. Dark ruby with rich creamy head. Sweet and clean with some plum and licorice. Empty for such a big beer with a salty metallic finish.
Huyghe Black Stout;Melle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Huyghe;Plain almost black beer with a slight coffee aroma like a stout, but that's where the similarities end. The flavour is fruity and leaves a fizz on the tongue. Overall a disappointing beer as it is a Belgian ale crossed with a stout.

Lighthouse Beacon ESB (formerly India Pale Ale);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Lighthouse Brewing (Canada);Love Lighthouse beers for being refreshing and easy to drink. This one is pretty good, pours golden amber with a fizzy head leaving no lace. Very earthy and malty for an IPA too. I�ll stick to their Switchback (an AMAZING beer) as far as IPAs go and take a pass on this one.
Lighthouse Beacon ESB (formerly India Pale Ale);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Lighthouse Brewing (Canada);Bottle 5.3% Taster pack. Clear amber pour with a weak, white head that bubbles away to a ring. Aroma is strong with hops, roasted malt, and is quite earthy. Taste is more of the same, dry hops and roast malts dominating the flavour, with a hint of caramel. Finish is dry, but balanced and satisfying. Quite good
Lighthouse Beacon ESB (formerly India Pale Ale);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Lighthouse Brewing (Canada);This is not an IPA, unless we are speaking about the world according to Alexander Keith. Beyond not being an IPA it�s also boring. A little malty without any head or lacing, pours clear orange. Tastes like a lager. Average carbonation. On tap at the Beagle Pub.
Lighthouse Beacon ESB (formerly India Pale Ale);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Lighthouse Brewing (Canada);Well Lighthouse what have you got for me tonight? An IPA you say, well then lets get this done. Lighter non-intense IPA, almost chocolaty, watery, lemon, earthy spice. Heavy malts with upfront bitterness that fades to sweet in the finish. There is a nondescript sharpness in the aroma that�s driving me nuts because I can�t figure it out. Good easy to drink beer with nothing really bad about it except probably one of the last IPA�s I�d ever reach for.
Lighthouse Beacon ESB (formerly India Pale Ale);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Lighthouse Brewing (Canada);Pity pack. Light amber, sticky thin of white head. Maybe my nose isn�t working. It�s fairly muted. Somewhat sweet caramel, light citrus and even lighter pine. English IPA style. Super drinkable. Heavy on the malts, light pine and spice, dull fruit but something makes my mouth water. Sharpness, much better warm.
Lighthouse Beacon ESB (formerly India Pale Ale);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Lighthouse Brewing (Canada);355ml brown bottle. Medium golden pour, large white head, foamy and airy. Some patchy lacework left in the glass. Nose has some sweetness and fruity notes and is pretty mild. Taste has caramel malt and fruitiness up front, grassy and mildly spicy hop notes. Grassy finish, late bitterness. Medium body, average carbonation. Overall pretty unexciting middle of the road English type IPA. Probably would not drink this again.
Lighthouse Beacon ESB (formerly India Pale Ale);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Lighthouse Brewing (Canada);355ml bottle pours a pale amber color with a finger of white head that leaves some decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is floral with some grass and hints of caramel. Taste is grassy hop bitterness with a generous malty sweetness for the style. A little on the sweet side for an IPA, but overall, still tasty and recommended as a good session ale.
Lighthouse Beacon ESB (formerly India Pale Ale);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Lighthouse Brewing (Canada);Amber, Copper. Floral hops comes through on the nose. Some oily bitterness but doesnt linger long. Good but not great IPA.
Ipswich Summer Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;From Sept 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with jwc215. Thanks Joe! It pours a hazy orange with about an inch of foam. Looks like some good lacing and head retention is above average. The smell has notes of caramel and some fruitiness, mainly oranges. A nice light but good nose. The taste is yum. The oranges hit my taste buds first followed by another fruit I can't put my finger on, some caramel sweetness and bread and a rather substantial citrus hop goodness right before and through the finish. Right at medium bodied, the carbonation is also medium, and man, is this Blonde Ale drinkable. Holy cow!! This is one that I could have easily drank all summer long! Bottom line: Usually, when I try an American Blonde Ale, I go in without expecting much but this one is a real winner in all categories. Love it!
Ipswich Summer Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12 oz. Can from craft 12 pack by distributed. Nice smell, with quite bit hops for a summer ale. But much appreciated.
Ipswich Summer Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Tastes very hoppy for a summer wheat ale. I liked the hoppy taste but that�s cause I�m a hop head, but i can see how this beer doesn�t appeal to certain individuals.
Ipswich Summer Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pours hazy golden brown. Sweet, citrus notes, but they�re overpowered by hoppy bitterness. OK, but not great.
Ipswich Summer Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12oz bottle. Poured a hazy yellow color with a smaller sized head. Muted ... wheat, citrus, and floral
Ipswich Summer Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Aroma is floral, hoppy, spicy. Taste is bitter and alcoholic. Spicy flavor with a wee bit of wheat but more hop than anything else. Not too easy/pleasant to drink due to the bitterness/alcoholic-ness throughout.
Ipswich Summer Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"12 oz. bottle picked up in Boston. Pours clear yellow. Nose is floral with honey; flavor is wheat, floral hops. Bitter finish. Easy to drink but not a lot of flavor."
Ipswich Summer Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Aroma is light floral and some caramel. Not what is expected for a wheat ale. Hazy golden appearance. Lightly bitter with some sweet notes. Easy drinking light body. I am confused, this seems like a typical blonde ale and barely has any wheat present in it.
Ipswich Summer Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Tap at Plan B, Springfield, 19/05/13. Clear pale golden with a thin white head. Nose is pale malts, citus, hops, caramel. Taste comprises pale malts, grass, citrus, light hops. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, light bitter notes in the finish. Ok stuff - basic but refreshing.
Ipswich Summer Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;(Bottle) I was impressed this ale would hold the white fluffy head throughout the entire length of the glass, complete with lacing. Nice unfiltered light golden complexion with persistent light combination. The flavor is light without being too watery or weak. Very drinkable for warm weather beer.
Tuckers Own Centaur;Sacramento, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;Brew It Up!;"This is one of the most all around beers. It seems to go good with everything. It�s not too strong, not too weak,more noticible than anything is the perfect texture going down. The bottle fermentation is really noticible; everytime you pour it a big foamy aromatic robust head forms, even down to the last drop."
Tuckers Own Centaur;Sacramento, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;Brew It Up!;I like this beer a lot. Compared to a classic like Old Peculiar, I would say that it has a better balance of sweet and bitter, whereas Old Peculiar is a little on the too sweet side.

Drakes Belgian Dark Ale;San Leandro, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Drakes Brewing Company;This beer was sampled at the 12 Hour Belgian Beer Festival 2004 thanks to Beerguy101..go mitch! This was bottle #142 of 375. It poured a clear orange hue with slight hints of yellow and a heavy degree of carbonation. The head was pretty small and non-existant.. a soapy little mess that dissipated quickly. The aroma was yeastiness at its finest..but it was a pretty light nose... took a little while to get the real scent. Some fruity nectar there as well (yes iceman..i said nectar). The taste is very light and slightly yeasty. Some fruity orange in there, and a nice mild finish with suspended yeasties at the bottom of my glass.. But really this had little to no kick at all. This beer was overcarbonated and underloaded with fruits and other flavors.. next!

Prevalent smoked peat flavor, lightly sweet with very light hopping. Light bodied, session-style mouth with lightly tart smokey finish. In the spirit of Belhaven Scottish. Quite good.

Chocolate DMS lagery aroma. Dark, mildly transparent mahogany color with a light tan head. Start is chocolate malts with roasted malts in the middle. A weird mustiness lingers in the finish. Tones of licorice are also present.
John Harvards Manchester Black Widow Lager;Manchester, Connecticut, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;John Harvards Brewhouse Manchester;Very tasty looking. Dark ruby red through light, with a light fluff of off white head riding atop. Aroma is malty, with good roastiness, mild hopping and that lagery aroma. Flavor is rich and roasty, with a hint of plum, perhaps. Hops are present only at the very end, lending a light sharpness to the finish. Balance is great, body is fairly light. Carbonation is definitely in full effect, yo. Lots of burps.
Camerons Summer Knights;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Camerons Brewery (UK);Cask at the Lord Moon Of The Mall in London. Weakened bronze. No head. Nose is mildly hopped with some ice tea notes, and some sweetened malts. Some nice wafts of fruit as well. Taste is very fruity with more sweetener coming through. Hop charcter is apparent as well. Moderate palate. Smooth in parts. Finish was more of the fruit taste.
Camerons Summer Knights;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Camerons Brewery (UK);Cask-conditioned @ JDW, Soton. Hops and caramel aroma. Thin with bitter taste and a touch of rustiness. Not too good and not very summery either.
Camerons Summer Knights;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Camerons Brewery (UK);Now under the Camerons badge. Pale amber colour. Clean and crisp, with a bit of dry malt, but a rather watery body. Not bad, but not exciting. Cask (handpump), Lord Moon of the Mall (JDW), Whitehall, London SW1.
Camerons Summer Knights;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Camerons Brewery (UK);Cask Fresh @ JDW's Sir Julian Huxley, Surrey. Pale rusty bronze colour. Aroma is wooly and musty. Pale malt, slightly sweet but not clingy or sticky. Thin to medium body. Fruit in the middle to finish - thin, slightly citric, quite refreshing. Slightly citric hops playing along on top becoming more assertive and more earthy in the finish. A pleasant, refreshing, decent quality and quite tingly stimulating ale. Nice.
Camerons Summer Knights;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Camerons Brewery (UK);Cask Conditioned. Pale yellow beer with thin head. Thin aroma with light malty lager flavour. One of the many attempts to move lager drinkers to beer, but ultimately highlighting the differences not making similarities would be better.
Great Dane Drop Anchor Steam;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;2/9/19. On tap at the downtown brewpub. Crystal clear light copper pour with a small off-white head that fades to a ring. Light malty aroma, caramel, a touch of fruitiness. Light flavor, dough, biscuit, a touch of caramel, a hint of hoppiness. Not bad.
Great Dane Drop Anchor Steam;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Spelled as Drop Anchor Steem at the brewery booth and on draught during Great Taste of Midwest 2009 in Madison, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-clear brownish amber colored brew with a fast dissolving off-white head. Aroma of roasted caramel malt, some bread crust, a hint of yeast and citrus. Taste is medium bodied, with flavors of roasted caramel malt, some bread dough and a touch of citrus. Finish is a little gritty with a toasted malt aftertaste that slowly disappears. More of a brown/amber ale than a California common but still enjoyable.
Great Dane Drop Anchor Steam;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;A light malty aroma on this brown pour. Somewhat nutty aroma. A crisp, clean body tasting mainly of bread but with a little yeast and hops.
Great Dane Drop Anchor Steam;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear copper color. Head was white, thin, and left a bit of lace behind. Not much aroma other than a whiff of graham cracker and light citrusy hops. Dry and crisp on the tongue. Flavor was as bland as the aroma. There was some toasted bread, nuts, and nonspecific subdued fruits. Pretty typical example of a marginal (at best) style.
Great Dane Drop Anchor Steam;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"12 ounce pour at downtown location This looked to be a good starter to the evening. It also turned out to be my only one as I got stuck driving but the Black Watch Scotch Ale should be on tap for at least a little bit longer in cask form. If not, there�s always something in the cellar. I wanted to give this a shot since the other alternative I was aware of was to try Anchor Steam. I�ve got nothing against Anchor but when I can support the local guys I go for it. Aroma / Appearance - The caramel body had a short half finger head that soon faded away to a slick oily covering. Caramels, cherries and wheat dominate the nose with a hint of citrus on the background. Flavor / Palate - Toasted rye bread, apple butter and malts form an interesting but relatively simple complexion. It doesn�t change much as it warms. It is a great session beer for those times when you don�t want the relative complexity of a porter or stout. On the whole I wouldn�t mind having a growler of this to open a tasting with; it wakes up the palate enough to get things going without leaving more than a dry slightly bitter finish."
Great Dane Drop Anchor Steam;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Pint at the downtown location. Poured a clear medium amber with a very nice initial cap of white head. Aroma was soft and pleasant with lightly toasted caramel and wisps of floral notes. The flavor followed suit, with soft caramel at the core and mild floral bitterness and lemon zest gracing the edges. Crisp and refreshing on the palate. Nice non-offensive, highly-sessionable brew.
Great Dane Drop Anchor Steam;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;(Tap) Pours a copper color with an average head. Decent lacing. Some citrus, with a long and dry aftertaste. Not particularly complex. Otherwise, it�s pretty good.
Great Dane Drop Anchor Steam;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Glad to see they brought this back after a long hiatus....but why in midwinter? A light, clear, amber brew with a short but pervasive head with some leggy lace. Clean tasting and crisp, light body with a fair amount of bitterness. Dry. Not a lot of depth or character, but very easy drinking.
Great Dane Drop Anchor Steam;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Dark amber color with a thin head. Mild hops aroma. Kind of a dusty taste, yet slightly sweet. A little lemon, perhaps? A pinch o� malt. Oddly tasty.
Great Dane Drop Anchor Steam;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Not a copy of Anchor, which is a plus. Maltier, fresher. Fruity and refreshing.
Great Dane Brides Cherry Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"Un-Muzzling Olde Muzzlehatch Ratings, #81. 12 ounce draught at the downtown Madison location, August 2008. Light very clear copper-pink with just a touch of creamy foam which diminishes to a thin ring...fresh sweet cherry nose with perhaps a hint of clove, and also just a bit of pale malt sweetness, cookie crumbs sprinkled in cherry juice...sweet cherry juice flavor, very clean and fresh, quite light, the fruit flavor continuing to the finish...a bit of tartness towards the finish, but probably not enough for those who can�t stand sweet fruity beers and demand that cherry be accompanied by the ""sour/wild"" ""sour brown"" or ""lambic-fruit"" appellations. To me it was pretty quaffable, never sticky or cloying, and it�s appropriate enough that this marks my 500th Wisconsin beer rating, given that Great Dane was probably the first brewpub in the state I ever visited, around 20 years ago, and that if pressed I�d name New Glarus� own cherry beer, Belgian Red, as my favorite beer. Here�s to fruit beers and the Badger state!"
Great Dane Brides Cherry Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at the downtown brewpub 8/8/08: Pours a transparent deep copper with a touch of ruby hues and a thin-lacing white head. Aroma of lightly sweet toasty pale malt and fruity cherries. Starts with a mild slightly grainy sweetness and decent semi-tart cherry balance. Pretty drinkable, but not that exceptional.
Great Dane Brides Cherry Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;(Draught) Pours a clear amber body with a small off-white (somewhat pinkish) head. Aroma of canned cherries, candish sugar, and almonds. Flavor of metallic and cherries with a watery mouthfeel.

Great Dane Brides Cherry Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at Great Dane - Downtown. Poured medium amber with a short cap of off-white head. The aroma picked up sweet dusty cherry skins over a paler malt base.. warmth brought out some cherry skin tartness.. OK. The flavor showcased pale malts and tart cherries with some sweetness as well from cherry meat.. light grassy bitterness surrounded and paired well with the cherry skins.. grainy finish. Drier on the palate and light-bodied.. some interesting elements, but it really fell off on the finish.. just OK.
Great Dane Brides Cherry Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Pours a semi hazey reddish colour with a thin off white head. Aroma is very pleasent, ripe tart cherry, cherry pie and danishes. Flavors are tart, satisfying with flavors of red licorice.
Great Dane Brides Cherry Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Tasted on tap at the downtown Madison location. This fruit beer pours a deep reddish color. Small sized pinkish foamy head. Aroma is cherry and tart, some malts. A medium bodied fruit beer. The malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are floral and earthy. There is a lot of both sweet, tart and sour cheery flavor in this beer. The fruit flavors are more tart and sour than sweet, yet they balance out just a bit to the sour side. There is also a nice malt backbone behind the fruit. Lively carbonated. This version of this beer is very good. An excellent example of just what a fruit beer could be. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly tart.
Great Dane Brides Cherry Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Clear ruby with off-white/pink cover. The aroma is cherry pie, almondm and caramel. The flavor is cherry, mildly tart and lemon. The mouthfeel is fizzy and light.
Great Dane Brides Cherry Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Small light pink head with a reddish-brown body. Very dry, tart, lots of cherry flavor and aroma. Difficult to drink a lot of as it really is over-the-top cherry flavor and quite acidic, but refreshing nonetheless. A bit too sweet.
Lammbr�u Pils;Eltmann, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lammbr�u Eltmann;Hops in the aroma. Little hazy, golden color, small white head, good lace. Flat, malty, smoked, light sweet, light bitter. Long lasting finish, smoked of course but more bitter and dry. Better than their lager but still not a very good example of the Bamberg smoked beers.
Lammbr�u Pils;Eltmann, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lammbr�u Eltmann;Gold color with a touch of copper, a bit hazy. Hardly any head. Fishy (!) aroma, like fresh herring. Malty flavor, a bit smoky with some apple. Fair deal of hopbitterness. A bit thin on the tongue, but a lovely beer. Has nothing to do with a pilsener, but still heartily recommended.
Lammbr�u Lager Bier;Eltmann, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Lammbr�u Eltmann;Light hoppy and light smoked aroma. Hazy, light amber color, small white head. Strongly smoked flavor, light sweet malts, medium body. Long lasting smokey finish.
Lammbr�u Lager Bier;Eltmann, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Lammbr�u Eltmann;Orange amber color, cloudy. Absolutely no head and not carbonated. Smokey aroma with apple. Slight smoky flavor with lots of apple fruitiness. Hints of oak. Thin, almost watery. Still beer that has something of a lambic but with less body and less intense complexity. Off course lacks the sourness of a lambic, but has some Bamberg smokiness. Certainly worth a try!
Lammbr�u Zwickl;Eltmann, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Lammbr�u Eltmann;Dark brown color. Cloudy, no head. Slight caramel and apple aroma. Just a bit of apple sourness, coffee and caramel. Almost no carbonation.

Dark Horse 3 Guy Off the Scale Old Ale;Marshall, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dark Horse Brewing Company;2008 bottle thanks to northernbrews for sharing. Clear copper-red pour with some minor bubbles. Aromas are raisins, caramel, red fruit, toffee candy, and cocoa. Tastes like apples, toffee, raisins, chocolate, and burnt sugar. Great mouthfeel, especially for a 6 year beer. Smooth and just a little syrupy. Abv is very well hidden. Love this. Please brew this again Dark Horse.
Dark Horse 3 Guy Off the Scale Old Ale;Marshall, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dark Horse Brewing Company;"Bottle: 2008 release. Thanks, Jeff. Syrupy looking, burnt caramel color. No head, just a few stray bubbles that rise to the top. Aroma is a good, balanced mix of caramel, toffee, apple, raisin, honey, graham cracker, sherry, & a little bit of cocoa powder. Not overpowering in any aspect, & the alcohol is very mild considering it�s 15% ABV. Nice, sweet caramel candy flavor; notes of toffee, apple, raisin, red grape, prune, toasted malts, sherry alcohol - warming but not overpowering, & nowhere near 15% ABV. Sweet, very slight oxidation, but it actually adds a layer of complexity rather than being hindering at this point. Oily, slick mouth feel. A very nice barley wine."
Dark Horse 3 Guy Off the Scale Old Ale;Marshall, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Tasted on 6/1/14 from a capped 12oz bottle obtained in a trade quite some time ago, this bottle has quite a bit of age on it. Pours a nearly opaque, dark, fiery auburn with a thin tan head that disappears fairly quickly. The nose is dominated by caramel, toffee, just a hint of nutty sherry oxidation coming through, raisin, date, and bit of a brighter cherry fruit note with some alcoholic heat. The flavor is all of those same characteristics with some added toasted chocolate bitterness. Everything is extremely well-integrated and balanced. The body is very full with light carbonation and a long lightly bitter caramel, toffee, and somewhat nutty sherry finish. Even with a lot of age, this is an excellent barley wine.
Dark Horse 3 Guy Off the Scale Old Ale;Marshall, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dark Horse Brewing Company;poured from a 12 ounce bottle, not sure of the vintage. Aroma: raisins and cherries were apparent whilst I poured the beer into the glass, sweet fruity alcohol, nutty, slight oxidized notes/ sherry Appearance: slightly cloudy amber with a small halo of bubbles Taste: raisins, cherries, sherry, burnt sugars, leathery Palate: medium/medium light bodied, surprising how light the body is with such a big beer, it never feels thin or watery Overall: This is an amazing Barley Wine, warming, easy to drink(this would be dangerous if I had more then one bottle), a treat for sure
Dark Horse 3 Guy Off the Scale Old Ale;Marshall, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Mahogany pour, small head.

Jennings JJ No. 1;Cockermouth, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Jennings Brewery (Marston's);Tasted this in the Saltcot, Saltcoats (JDW) in May 2003. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale russet in colour with a thin white head. Floral hops in the short nose. Thin weak mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives a poor digestive malt base with slight redcurrant fruit. Floral hops in the short bitter aftertaste leaves some astringency. Finish is poor and runs out of legs. Has a slightly sweet malty edge but nothing more. An ok session bitter.

The aroma is light - what is there is of sweet caramel. The flavor is roasted with loads of chocolate, leading to a nice dry bitter end, but the body is a little thin. A very refreshing beer.

Jennings JJ No. 1;Cockermouth, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Jennings Brewery (Marston's);Lift it and cry to the eagles that come down from the cargs with meat in their claws for two peaple. This is a decent drop to spill. A brown ale is my thinking.

Jennings JJ No. 1;Cockermouth, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Jennings Brewery (Marston's);Nicely bottled. It doesn't indicate that this is bottle conditioned, but it behaves and tastes as if it is. A wondeful chocolate and coffee aroma with a touch of musty oak and a slap of leather. Very drinkable with a restrained but tasty balance of dark malts and tree bark hops. A classic bitter using classic English hops to good effect. Long dusty finish. Good 'un!

Breckenridge Breck Light;Denver, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Draught from brewpub in Breck. Piss light yellow/golden beer with small white head. Aroma is caramel and sweet citrus and spice. The flavor brewing cereal, bland and thin. Generally lightly sweet and not really any balance at the end. I wouldn�t expect Breckenridge to have an offering like this.

Breckenridge Breck Light;Denver, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Draft at the brewpub. A very light golden beer with a thin white head.

Breckenridge Breck Light;Denver, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Clear yellow. It has an unusual aroma, not too nice for me, or I would guess, a Bud drinker. Some crispness and lightness, but an off flavor was present, or maybe just a flavor which is unique in this type of beer. Some spiciness, overall not too good.
Breckenridge Breck Light;Denver, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Really light colored, no real head retention. Fair amount of carbonation. They must have been sick of having people asking for Coors Light, so instead of carrying it, they brewed their own.

Broadstone Black Abbot;Retford, Nottinghamshire, England;Porter;Broadstone;Cask (gravity dispense) at GBBF 2005. Can�t believe I�d not rated a Broadstone beer before. Darkish brown colour. Mainly chocolate accented and, as suggested, with touches of licorice. But it lacked the sour edge that I might expect from a porter. Either the recipe has changed, or the bottled version is different or (most likely in my view) those who noted excessive sourness in the bottle have got beer from a bad batch. I found this perfectly pleasant but a bit short of clout.
Broadstone Black Abbot;Retford, Nottinghamshire, England;Porter;Broadstone;Nutty, chocolate aroma is fairly sweet. Clear, dark chestnut brown with low off-white head. Fairly roasty flavour has some chocolate and nutty character. Medium-light body with somewhat low carbonation. Cask at GBBF 2005.
Broadstone Black Abbot;Retford, Nottinghamshire, England;Porter;Broadstone;[Cask conditioned] Very dark brown coloured. Very malty and roasty. Very nice.
Broadstone Black Abbot;Retford, Nottinghamshire, England;Porter;Broadstone;Why do so many bottle conditioned beers have a nasty bitter aftertaste? This initially tasted like a sour bottle of vinegar. After a while it did start to resemble something drinkable..It might have come from a bad batch but has nobody ever heard of quality control ? In its cask form no doubt this is a pleasant beer,but in a bottle, no thanks.
Broadstone Black Abbot;Retford, Nottinghamshire, England;Porter;Broadstone;Very dark brown with a beige head. Aromas are are sour berries and chocolate - a bit of a mess and not typical of the style. Flavours are fruity and sour and lacking the chcolate and licourice promised on the label. To be fair hints of chocolate do poke through the nastiness. Perhaps this is a badly bottled beer that is decent from the cask. Its as if the wrong yeast has been used in the bottle conditioning. Messy.
Broadstone Black Abbot;Retford, Nottinghamshire, England;Porter;Broadstone;Draught at the Swan in the Rushes, Loughborough. Very dark red/black coloured, with average, foamy, tan coloured, long lasting head. Fruity, sourish aroma. Roasted-malt flavour, with a nice sour finish . Smooth and full bodied.

Lake Superior Granite Brown Ale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Adventures with Tim outside of KBC beers. Yup, we were in Grand Marais, supposed to go to some gun show. He got all sorts of screwed up and found out the show was in the Soo. We found ourselves here and well, we both sat down at the bar and right onto broken seats the both of us. Yup, we fell right onto the floor, and probably looked liked idiots, but hey, the establishment should�ve had the seats fixed. So, well....okay, well we probably looked as funny as the brewer who brewed this beer as it wasn�t that good.
Lake Superior Granite Brown Ale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;On tap @ the brewery 6/1/07. Dark complexion with very little head. Slightly malty aroma. Taste is overly sweet malts with some light nut flavors also. I didn�t enjoy this beer enough to get more than one, and unfortunately this was the only beer they had on tap at the time to try.
Lake Superior Granite Brown Ale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;An even deep mahogay, edged in off-white. No aroma. All flavor and sugars is dominated by an artificial and weak cheap maple syrup taste. No malt character, no hops. Just maple syrup and water. Ick. Palate has no balance, therefore. One of the worse browns of all time.
Lake Superior Granite Brown Ale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Sweet....dark brown....had this a few days ago...like dit alot.....very malty with a almond tate...lame review i know
Lake Superior Granite Brown Ale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Solid dark brown in color much like weak-looking coffee, no real head was produced but very nice off-white stringy lace all over the glass. Smell is faint and delicate with roasted malt, nuts, hazelnuts, with a very minimum citrus hop tingle. Solid tasting brown though, very subtle, nice roasted malt character with a slight note of hazelnut and a small hop note in bitterness in the finish thats all very smooth, slightly warming, and drinkable. Feel is medium and a bit gritty/grainy near the finish. Not a bad brown at all, could use a boost though.
Lake Superior Cabin Fever ESB;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a pale orange to copper color with a quarter finger�s worth of white foamy head that fell off fairly quick. No lace. The aroma had some caramel/toffee malts up front with a little bit of toast, grassy hops and some light earthiness. The flavor was mostly sweet through all of the previously mentioned aromas. Aftertaste was between the malts and toast, very little hop presence. Malty finish. The feel was about light bodied, perhaps just a touch above. Good sessionability about it. Mild carbonation. Overall, decent as a food beer but not a true to style ESB.
Lake Superior Cabin Fever ESB;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;tap at the brewpub - Pours hazy orange with a small, lingering white head. There�s a mild toasted caramel malt aroma. The flavor is mostly sweet malt with some quite mild hops bitterness mainly in the finish that serves to keep the malt under control. It�s light bodied and overall a decent beer, but that�s about it.
Lake Superior Cabin Fever ESB;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Amber brew with a thin head, served in a pub style pint glass. Great aroma of sweet malt and rich, complex hops. Flavor is excellent blend of a slightly sweet maltiness offset by a strong but restraint citrus and piney hops finish. This is excellent and to my thinking more traditional than their Sandstone Pale Ale. These days I�m more interested in brews that explore and elaborate on tradition, rather than trying to emulate it. But that�s no detraction form this � it is a fine ale, quite excellent, and highly recommended.
Lake Superior Cabin Fever ESB;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;On tap at the brewery. Hazy coppery body, thin tight off-white head. Light bready, sweet body with citrusy and piney hops providing nice balance. Refreshing and quaffable.
Lake Superior Cabin Fever ESB;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;An even tawny mahogany pour with a fringed edging of gold and a white rim of head. Distant hops and malt aroma. A somehwat off toasted oat sugars, with a rough woody grain and oaky presentation. Some buttery Cascade touches in there...maybe some diacetyl? It�s okay. Palate carries some decent balance, which is pleasent. Certainly the most drinkable and nicely sessionable of their beers.
Lake Superior Cabin Fever ESB;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;I thought this was too hoppy for a ESB, but still pretty good. I had this last week and only gotten to reviewing right now. Terrible rating I know.
Lake Superior Cabin Fever ESB;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Bottle. Dark hazy amber with a medium tan head. Gusher. Touch of caramel and hops in the aroma. Fairly typical ESB profile, nice bitterness and a tiny hint of astringcency in the dry finish. Decent palate? Bit of a funky tang lingering in background making only slight appearances. Average but pleasant. Thanks DuctTape.
Lake Superior Cabin Fever ESB;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Color is a nice golden light amber with a copper tone. Very thin head but has light off-white stringy lace that sticks well. Smell is a nice floral citrusy aroma, very pronounced, a bit crisp and very fresh with a nice caramel backing, quite a decent wiffer. Taste is mellowing smooth of citrusy hops with a very nice little hop twinge that dances on the tongue a bit and goes down smooth with a slight lingering bitterness thats not overpowering in the least. Caramel malt backing that keeps it balanced is a bit noticeable. Solid medium body, pretty full and a nice bittering dryness in the finish. This is pretty good stuff, an American take on the English style ESB thats not to hoppy or piney.

This ESB poured a nice mid-grade amber with light with head. Aroma is of hops and malt with some floral accents and a bit of pine present.

South Shore Extra Pale Ale (ESB);Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;South Shore Brewery;Great glowing amber copper toned hue with a pencil width high head of off-white ivory foam and leaves small stitching of lace all around the glass.

Taste is lightly hopped and piney bittered, pretty easy to handle and dries with a nice hop twinge that mellows quickly. Medium bodied but getting light with nice drying in the finish. Pretty solid but could offer more spunk and lasting flavors for an EPA.

Hoppy aroma, hay and grass, malty addendum. Taste is a bit flat and monotonous, no hop detected. The only highlight is a slightly sweet, carbonation lined caramel and bread flashing right before the finish that is more a fade out than anything lasting.

Jasper Ridge Red Earth Pale Ale;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Jasper Ridge Brewery;On draught at the brewpub in Ishpeming, Northern Michigan. Pours a clear golden amber colored brew with a thin off-white head that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some excellent lacing. Aroma is fruity, some caramel malt, flowery hops and some earthy herbs. Taste is medium bodied with flavors of caramel malt, a touch of apple skin, grassy and floral hops and a touch of spice. Finish is mildly bitter with some grapefruit zest and grassy hop aftertaste.
Jasper Ridge Red Earth Pale Ale;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Jasper Ridge Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Faint hop aroma. I can tell there�s something there, but it doesn�t really show. Pours a clearish amber-gold, with an off-white head above. Flavor is dirty and bitter. Ugh. What�s in here? Pennies, socks and iron ore? Messy, this is all over the road. A typical, darker pale ale base is here, but it�s tainted with some off-earth character and a bad, bad bitterness. This is the kind of hoppy beer that turns people off of good beer. For that, I loathe this example. Learn how to get some flavor out of hops and don�t just make something bitter.
Jasper Ridge Red Earth Pale Ale;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Jasper Ridge Brewery;On tap at the restaurant/brewpub. Translucent orange-brown body, medium buff head. Medicinal hops aroma, herbal, perfumey, and earthy. Malts are dry. Body is also dominated by perfumey, medicinal hops (I can�t think of the hops variety, but it�s a distinctive one). Toasty, slightly caramely malt backs the hops profile. Strays from the typical pine and grapefruit pale ale hops theme. OK.
Jasper Ridge Red Earth Pale Ale;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Jasper Ridge Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, Ishpeming MI. This and the stout were the pick of the beers here for me. Attractive bright ginger colour with a lasting white head. Nice condition - lively without being too fizzy. Plenty of grapefruit hop character in the aroma and flavour. Dry, bitter mouthfeel. Very refreshing. Nothing particularly out of the ordinary, and maybe a little one-dimensional, but a very good example of the style. This was the beer I returned to for a pint after finishing the sampler.

Jasper Ridge Red Earth Pale Ale;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Jasper Ridge Brewery;Festival tap: Amber brown with a nice toasted malt nose. Flavor is toasty as well with a nice bitterness at the finish, medium bodied and light on malt flavor.
Jasper Ridge Brown Ale;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Jasper Ridge Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy burnt brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. Light lacing stuck around but slid after a while. The smell had a decent nutty/roasty caramel/toffee, earthy and slightly toasty. The taste was mainly the same. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. There�s a nutty aftertaste with a dry caramel finish. Overall, I say this was a pretty good brown ale.
Jasper Ridge Brown Ale;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Jasper Ridge Brewery;Draft at brewpub. Dark brown roasty malt. Astringent vinegar aftertaste . . . something wrong with this one.
Jasper Ridge Brown Ale;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Jasper Ridge Brewery;Draft at brewpub. Very dark brown pour with a thin off white head. Sweet brown sugar aroma with a hint of roastiness. Initial sweet nutty flavor turns to a tart, apple vinegar finish. A solid brown ale.

Jasper Ridge Brown Ale;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Jasper Ridge Brewery;Jasper Brown Ale, on tap at the restaurant/brewpub. Deep orange-brown body, thin buff head. Cerealy, acidic, toasty nose. Very light, watery body, with toast and earthy hops, also perhaps a touch of red grape. Earthy bitter finish. Crisply carbonated. I preferred my cudighi sandwich.
Jasper Ridge Brown Ale;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Jasper Ridge Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, Ishpeming MI. Murky red/brown colour. Thin beige head. Soft caramel and toffee aroma with, unfortunately, some diacetyl. The same sweet shop cocktail of toffee, caramel and butterscotch on the palate. There are some sharp notes too, turning sour on the finish, which didn�t really fit with the other attributes of the beer. Plenty of people appreciate these caramel malty brown ales. Unfortunately, I don�t. Especially with the sour elements in the mix.
Jasper Ridge Brown Ale;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Jasper Ridge Brewery;Color is very nice for a brown, its dark brown of deep, darl, varnished oak with dark amber highlights. Thin off-white head of tight foam, creamy, small lacy patches linger then fade. Smell faintly of dark wheat, roasted malts and a great nutty backing, hazel and chestnut I believe.Taste is complex and in subtle layers, all smooth and soild of roasted malts and mixed nuts and has a very slight dark fruit, bananaish note, and a hop twingy bittering late, very interesting. Nice late dryness follows, mellowing out even more so then at first. One soild brown ale with a medium body and light grainyness thats pretty drinkable. It could use a bit more boldness, but is relaxing and good none the less. I enjoyed it. Solid offering.
Jasper Ridge Mather Black Cherry Wheat;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jasper Ridge Brewery;Color is a unique orangey-brownish, much like weak maple syrup. No head or lace on this one. Smell is mostly tart cherries and very fresh and softly deep cherry sense filling the nose, very nice. Taste is tart, sharp but dulled of dark cherry with a light wheat backing. Levels off quickly leaving it a bit empty in the end. Feel is pretty light and getting close to medium, watered down. Its an OK cherry beer, made with real black cherries and it shows, but is lacking in body and length of character. Still would make for a good summer heat beat beer.
Jasper Ridge Gallaghers Stout;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Stout;Jasper Ridge Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Paired nicely with a fish n chips meal. Aroma: roasted malt, coffee, hint of chocolate. Smooth and creamy palate.

Jasper Ridge Gallaghers Stout;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Stout;Jasper Ridge Brewery;2008 MiBGF: Opaque with an excellent creamy beige head and very good lace. The aroma has notes of grassy hops, roasted and chocolate malt, walnut, raisins and some coffee. The taste is lactic and fruity with a nutty and chocolate background, rather simple and straight forward palate. The mouth feel is smooth and soft. Starts nice but in the end is just an okay beer.
Jasper Ridge Gallaghers Stout;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Stout;Jasper Ridge Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Noses in light coffee and coconut liqueur. Pours a deep black-mahogany, with a really intense mocha head, staying. This is really sweet, but surprisingly complex tasting. I hate the sweetness, but love the blend of nuts, caramelized sugars, vanilla, bourbon, and roast that comes through. For that is complex. And actually, some of the Guinness-like thinness helps fight off the hazelnut-syrup sweetness. In the end, I�m a little confused by this beer. The sweetness hurts, but the malt character isn�t bad. If this was an Imperial, people would be drooling all over it, but the watery lack of carbonation hurts a little.
Jasper Ridge Gallaghers Stout;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Stout;Jasper Ridge Brewery;On tap at the restaurant/brewpub. Deep opaque brown body, tan nitro head. Light chocolate aroma with moderate sweetness, backed by roast. Strong chocolate body with a fairly strong caramely characteristic, light sweetness. Subdued bitter finish. Smooth but something seems to be missing. Perhaps a bit too much caramel confuses the palate.
Jasper Ridge Gallaghers Stout;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Stout;Jasper Ridge Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, Ishpeming MI. This and the Red Earth Pale Ale were the pick of the beers here for me. Good dark brown/red, almost black, appearance with a persistent mushroom coloured head. Roasty aroma, with plenty of mocha notes. More coffee comes through on the palate. Smooth mouthfeel, but a little residual sweetness lowers the score a notch for me. A decent, tasty stout nonetheless. Perhaps it just shone in comparison with the preponderance of light beers - a Kolsch, 2 Wheats and 2 Fruit Wheats - in an 8 beer sampler .

Jasper Ridge Gallaghers Stout;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Stout;Jasper Ridge Brewery;Sampled this beer at the Great Taste of the Midwest in Madison WI.

Jasper Ridge Gallaghers Stout;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Stout;Jasper Ridge Brewery;from a growler--seems a little flat, perhaps because of the growler. smells smoky and roasty with some dark chocolate in there somewhere. taste is very roasted and earthy, plenty of woody coffee in there too. finishes slightly bitter, but aside from being a little thin this is a good stout.
Jasper Ridge Gallaghers Stout;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Stout;Jasper Ridge Brewery;Color is a solid black with slivers of dark ruby highlights. Small but foamy creamed head thats light brownish creamy colored, leaves no lace though, what a shame. Smell is coffeeish and lightly earthy like wet soil, dark mustyness with darl roasted malts lingering and a note of chocolate malt. Gets a dark cherry note upon bigger wiffs way in the back. Taste is light and subtle with dark roasted malts, earthy with coffee, nuts, and chocolate notes changing the tune as it goes. Has a very nice woodsy like drying in the finish, a bit burnt-like. Its a bit empty at the start then layers begin to mingle. Feel is a lighter body style smooth and barely creamy, could be heavier, good drinkable light stout.

Jasper Ridge Rope's Golden Wheat;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Jasper Ridge Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, Ishpeming MI. Straw colour with a very slight haze. Incomplete white head. Not much in the way of aroma. Subtle citrus flavour (it was served with a slice of lemon although at least that was just on the side of the glass not floating in the beer). Clean and refreshing mouthfeel. Not a great style but this is a decent enough example. Not much else to say.

Jasper Ridge Rope's Golden Wheat;Ishpeming, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Jasper Ridge Brewery;Color is somewhat pale light yellow and diluted with a thin foamy head, leaves no lace. Smell is very faint of musty dust with a lemon and sweet honey note. Taste is very wheatly sweet and lemony, vey mellow and easy. Leaves lots of lemon-like tartness and is a bit watery. Feel is light bodied for sure, watered down. Its their top seller, and I see why, its a lighter fare which compares to most macro lights.

Green Mill KabeeLo Lager;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;"The server said that this was a ""Canadian Style Lager,"" but if that�s true, its better than anything by Molson and Company. Poured a clear golden yellow, with just a thin trace of pure white head. Pretty light on the aroma. Good hoppiness up front, like a good Eastern European lager, but it didn�t stick around very long. Decent mouthfeel, good carbonation. A bit of lemon in the aftertaste. Very clean, very smooth beer. Refreshing and well made. Not really my style of brew, but nicely drinkable. Goes good with pizza."

Soft on the nose with a crisp sweetness from malt and a light honey-like note. Taste is excellent, perfectly light textured smoothness and medium bodied. Flavors on this are quite nice and subtle in its layers. Starts with a favorable light bite of hop thats just right and flows into a nice sweet tartness, very smooth with a hint of sugared honey in there. Perfectly balanced, subtle and pleasing beyond belief. One very amazing pilsner and so drinkable its not even funny."
Green Mill Stone Beer;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Pale yellow color with no head or aroma. Just a bit of a grain, like standing outside a grain elevator. Plain, borring, sad...
Green Mill Stone Beer;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Being an amature rock hound I loved the idea behind this old world process of throwing in warm granite stone boulders to kick in the carmelization. If you lick, thats right, lick, rocks like I do while trying to bring out colors of agates and minerals in rocks and stones, this beer is a fine pleasure for the palate. This beer has a solid pilsner look about it, golding yellow, sparkly and glowing, some carbonation bubbles flowing. Received with a finger high head of tight white frothy foam, leaves small spotty lace and a good retention ring on top the whole glass through. Smell is incredible for this ale, it smells like granite, I swear it does, really. Highly sweet light citrus and clean hoppy freshness, sharp and cutting of minerals, salt, and very strikingly so. Very unique and distinct, wow. Taste continues into the realm of uniqueness again, highly sweet of grapefruit rinds and yeasty grained. Textured and flavored much like the granite stones themselves, and I tell you this in the high regards of confidence that is what I'm tasting in this beer... Granite rocks! Which in by itself is like a mix of light ocean sea salt and white pepper, very mineral-like or perhaps like a vitamin supplement, but not mediciny in the least, quite distinct. Hops all over the place finding home in every crevice of your mouth, but nothing over the top at all, balanced well with a very nice malt backing. Making this one uniquely textured and flavorful beer, leaves your tongue in a bump tingly mood. Quite full as well, and smoothing out a bit for a great finish. Amazing little beer.

Rocky River Sub Chaser Hefeweizen;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);On draft at brewpub This was by far the best release at the brewpub. As a general rule it seems that if you stick to the German styles here then you might come out with something that is more than a forgettable pour. I�ll certainly keep that in mind next time I visit. Aroma / Appearance - The cloudy yellowish base looks almost like diluted fresh squeezed orange juice with a clean white styrofoam cap. Vanilla, ripe bananas, orange peels and dough push this to the bready side of the style without a doubt. Flavor / Palate - An easy drinker fills the mouth with its fluid presence. Lemons, bananas, and orange pulp enrich the profile and move it from run of the mill to above average. Vanilla custard and honey bookend a well balanced spectrum. I am glad I ordered the 20 ounce pour of this rather than any of the other current drafts.
Rocky River Sub Chaser Hefeweizen;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Sample at the brewpub.

Rocky River Sub Chaser Hefeweizen;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Hazy, pale and lemon-tinted caramel orange in color with a persistent white snowcap for the head. Sugary bananas are aromatically represented with a buttercream base and milky vanilla characteristics. Sweet cream sings with vanilla wafers, and a slight waft of cotton rides its coattails. Creaminess drops for the lemon banana chiffon flavor to come full circle. The vanilla�s there, in a wafer crust sort of way, getting soggy as the banana persists upon it. Gentle carbonation lacks the effervescence, but the pastry portrayal fills in for her flavor. The otherwise medium body kilters toward yogurt intuitions, encouraging vanilla, lemons and bananas with a subtle breezy bitterness in the end.

Daleside Duff Blonde;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Daleside Brewery;Not the most aromatic golden ale. A clear and pale one covered by almost no head. Soft bready malts with the characteristic grainy bottom that are complemented by limey and bright, but light hops. Swift sweeping bitterness follows. The ensemble is quite clean, but never takes a single risk and remains deceptively thin-bodied.
Daleside Duff Blonde;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Daleside Brewery;Sampled cask conditioned at Akkurat, Stockholm, Sweden. This pale golden, crystal clear ale must surely be named after the famous Australian Ratebeerian. It has an orangey nose, is sweet, fruity and well rounded with soft mouthfeel and notes of vanilla and strawberries. It's an easy drinking ale, well suited for summer weather and has average bitterness and a fair amount of character.

Rocky River Lil Warrior;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);On tap at the Beer Engine. Pours a lightly hazy golden amber with a medium creamy/bubbly off white head that left some lacing. Aroma was a bunch of fresh American hops, lots of citrus notes, light pine, floral, some toasted malt and caramel. Flavor was pretty much the same with some grassy notes, again a bunch of fresh hop flavor and a nice malt backbone. Hop bitterness there, but not overpowering as a good American Pale Ale should be.

The aroma has a hint of citrusness, The malt flavor comes through with some breadiness followed by a soft sort of bitterness that continues into the finish. This was a decent brew. I was pleased with this as I have not been wild about previous offerings from RRBC.
Rocky River Lil Warrior;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);On tap at a tasting this evening. Pours a orange color with off white head. Had a nice pine smell to it in the background. Only problem was the soap smell upfront. I kept thinking maybe this was a very well washed glass. Then I knew that wasn�t the case when I had a second pour. Mouthfeel was medium. Had a great flavor of pine and malt sweetness. Has a nice flavor overall, but I just can�t get that soap smell out of it.
Rocky River Lil Warrior;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Cloudy, faded orange color w/o much head. Lots of pine aromas, but there was also a wierd, kinda off thing going on too that I couldn�t really put a name on. Maybe soap? Anyway, it tasted better than it smelled, with flavors of pine tree and mild malts. Pretty full bodied and oily. Finished with more piney hops. Not the best version of this beer, according to the brewer. Problems with water pressure and the chiller gave him problems throughout the brewing process of this one, so I�ll re rate it next time it�s on.
Rocky River Lil Warrior;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Great citrus/hop aroma. Looks very nice and deep golden - I haven't often seen an unfiltered pale ale. Listed at 60 IBU, this started with some sharp citrus notes, and as it warmed the hops became fuller and thicker (not quite sticky). Smooth but not thick. This was my favorite of the evening (6/25/03)
Wapping Smoked Porter;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Porter - Smoked;Wapping;Cask @ Baltic Fleet, Liverpool. Very dark with a small off-white head. Has a good roasted malt nose with a very drinkable texture that does not feel its strength. There�s a small sweetness within its taste, but there�s still some roasted malt in here too, with the smokiness evident in both aroma and taste, but more pronounced in the latter aspect, as well as lingering a while in the palate. The smokiness provides a ham flavour.

Wapping Smoked Porter;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Porter - Smoked;Wapping;Cask handpull at The Baltic Fleet, Liverpool. Wow, I am so surprised that I haven�t rated this before. More porter than smoke. But good chewy malts and subtle smoke aroma and flavour. Quite a lot of choc on aroma. Would have stayed for a second pint but the pissed up Liverpool fan sat opposite was starting to scare me. And this was just after midday when the match was starting at 4pm. Jesus.

Millys Tavern Summer Wheat;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;i had this because it was the only Milly's beer they had on tap that i hadn't tried before. the bartender asked me if i wanted it with strawberry or lemon in it. i said strawbeery because it sounded kinda neat. i got this peach-colored liquid in a pint glass that reminded me of amaretto and orange juice. i'm not a fan of wheat beers at all and the only thing keeping this rating up as high as i rated it was the strawberry. Milly's makes some kick-ass beers, but this is definately the worst by far.
Millys Tavern Summer Wheat;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Eh, what can i say. This was someone else's beer that i tried, it had a shot of strawberry in it. It had a stange peachy color because of the berry shot and the aroma turned me off, almost medicinal. The flavor wasn't much better. Cough medicines taste better to me. I'm not a fan of wheat beer and this one was made worse by the berry. Wouldn't reccommend it to anyone.
Millys Tavern Summer Wheat;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Wheat Ale;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;I saw a pint from across the bar and realized that Milly's had a new beer. A summer wheat. Unfortunately an American wheat beer, of which I've never had a good one. This one has berries in it which gave it a sour off-tone at the end. Besides that and the perfect cloudy golden-orange color, it was like many other wheat beers that would have been better with a good German hefe yeast strain.

Beck Br�u Jahrhundert Bier Dunkel;Lisberg-Trabelsdorf, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Brauerei Beck Trabelsdorf;Multiple fresh bottles over the years in Bambergerland: Rusty chestnut. Tight pearly foam. Clean malt aromatics of nuts, cocoa, tilled earth, honeyed biscuits and toasted bread. Hops contribute a hint of licorice beneath. Delicate pinpricks of carbonation. Firm body. Artfully layered breadcrust, plum skin and a dusting of cocoa merges with a scratch of earthy, anise-tinged bitterness. Strikingly succulent hoppiness steps up to match the fat but clean malt core. Polished malt continually reveals its many dimensions, with a pils-derived vanilla cookie crispness smattered with tiramisu and creamed java notes. Discernible unripe-plum acidity boosts drinkability yet does slightly inhibit development as it displaces some of the powdery textures. Assertively hoppy and licoricey finish is charged with a staunch mineralic snap which paves the way for complex malt notes of cookie, hazelnut, creamed java and toffee. An enjoyably clean and harmonious Franconian dunkel.

Mill Street Hemp Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Well. I�m not a fan of hemp beer. I think it is an abomination of the true nature of beer. Mill Street does everything well though, including brrewing this hemp beer. It was a decent hemp (for hemp beer).
Mill Street Hemp Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);As far as I know, this is only available on tap at the Distillery area where the brewery is located. It�s alright as an opportunity for Mill Street to expand their repertoire, but it�s not my favourite. Kind of nutty and earthy, with a nice dark colour that belies its relatively mild taste. Alright as a genre exercise, but they�d be better off sticking to their other beers.

Mill Street Hemp Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Again, just catching up my ratings here. I tried this at the outdoor jazz festival last year in the distillery district and it was my favourite beer of the night, which surprised me because the few hemp ales I have had so far in my life have been gimmicky and not very good. This one poured a deep brown with a floral nose of some sort (I could say hemp, but I was probably just looking for it). The word earthy has been used in previous ratings and that is fair � there really isn�t any hop bite here, but there is a very drinkable medium bodied ale. I found it well balanced which surprised me. Very good, I wonder if it has changed at all in the past year.

Mill Street Hemp Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);I was at Pure Spirits, the pretentious restaurant and bar across from the Mill Street brewery, and I ordered a pint of their Tankhouse Pale Ale. I received something that looked like the Pale Ale, and smelled sort of like the Pale Ale, but it definately didn't taste like the Pale Ale. It wasn't bad by any means, it just didn't have the same hop bite, but instead had a more prominent sweet and earthy flavour, with subdued hops in the dry finish. Before I had a chance to question my server about it, I overheard another waitress listing the beers for someone, and a new Hemp beer was mentioned. I ran into one of the Mill Street guys outside after lunch, and he confirmed that what I had sounded like the Hemp beer. So that's what I'm guessing I had. Either that, or the Tankhouse Pale Ale was REALLY off that day...

Has a very malted mouthfeel and a slightly spiced hop finish. mid palate, the taste resembles a candycane with a touch of mintiness.
Augsburger Golden;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;"Pkbites on the first page of the ratings says it all, so I won�t repeat what he said. What I will say is Augsburger was arguably the best lager in the USA, bar none. I recall my Dad drinking it in the 60s from quart bottles, and I loved it through the 80s in the green 6-packs. As the last regional to hold the Augsburger contract, I do not understand how Huber can�t make their Berghoff Lager taste like this! No excuse. RIP Augsburger; we loved ya! UPDATE: just went to the Monroe, Wisconsin website for the people that apparently bought out Huber. The music is the same as the Pabst website. Sadly, all my questions have been answered."
Augsburger Golden;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;12oz bottle. Golden with large quickly fading bubbly head. Semi-skunky aroma with a touch of bread & fruit. Astringent & thin, but does give way to some mild hops & fruitiness but dryness prevails. Nothing special here.

Augsburger Golden;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;"From a 12-oz bottle, picked up from Pick & Save in Marshfield, WI, pours a light golden honey yellow with a thin fast dissolving head. Lots of carbonation. Aroma is immediate skonk maybe a little citrus but even more SKONK! The skunkiness may indicate the green bottle does not block the sunlight. Taste is very highly carbonated, grainy and sour. Finish is gritty and sour. This may have been a bad bottle but I remember the Augsburger from Huber was much better. Interesting history trail of this brew... 1951 to 1961 - Monarch Brewing Co, - Chicago; 1961 to 1972 - Potosi Brewing Co, - Potosi, WI; 1973 - 1989 Huber Brewing Co, - Monroe, WI; 1989 - 1997 Stroh Brewing Co, - Detroit, MI; 1997 - 2002 (limbo); 2002 - present Stevens Point Brewery, Stevens Point, WI"
Augsburger Golden;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;From a twist off 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. Poured a clear lager golden with a small foamy white head. Grainy and grassy aromas with a light spicy and a subtle fruitiness. Even, steady carbonation and a softly crisp, smooth light bodied mouthfeel. Grainy tasting with a very light caramel, a little lemon-like fruitiness, a soft spiciness, the hops are way in the background, and a sort of dry hayish, sweet malty finish. Passable drinkability, but I wasn�t too impressed with this lager, glad I only purchased this as a single.
Augsburger Golden;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;orange/ligtbrown color, thin lasting head, nice one with plesant grainy parts and hops,... a little less bottom and balance.

Golden Valley Chehalem Mountain IPA;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;IPA;Golden Valley Brewery;On tap at Golden Valley, pours a hazy pale golden blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out piney hops and just enough biscuity malt to back. Flavour is very clean, with piney hops, some fruity and floral notes, and just enough biscuity malt backbone. Clean and hoppy, with excessive drinkability.
Golden Valley Chehalem Mountain IPA;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;IPA;Golden Valley Brewery;Draft - Sweet grapefruit and pine. Clear gold and a decent white head. Bright grapefruit notes and a nice pithy bitter finish. Solid.

Delafield Hopfenstange Pils;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Delafield Brewhaus;Sampled at GTMW �11. Goddamn, why aren�t there more of these? Or why don�t they get the attention they deserve? It�s a full-flavored lager with plenty of grassy, classy, spicy hop character. Aroma was like sticking my nose in the foil bag from the homebrew shop. Moderately bitter in the flavor... gives you a little slap but sets no limits on your gullet. Also, bitchin� name.
Delafield Hopfenstange Pils;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Delafield Brewhaus;On tap @ Delafield. Clear golden yellow with a pure white head. Aroma of bready malt, hay, citrus and fresh cut grass. Flavor is a great balance of bready/toasty pils malt and bitter citrus hops. Light body with active carbonation and a very smooth, clean, refreshing finish. I really like this beer, kind of a hybrid of the style but it works so well and is extremely drinkable.
Delafield Hopfenstange Pils;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Delafield Brewhaus;Pale gold. Tangy noble/citrus hopping and light sweet malts. Pale lager malts followed by even, refreshing citrus hopping. Crisp, lightly acidic, light on the palate. Easy to drink. An overall success for the style.
Delafield Hopfenstange Pils;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Delafield Brewhaus;Decent pils with a light color but with some nice hop character. The light sweet bready malt hid well in the background allowing for the low hop character to stick out a little. Well blended brew but could have gone for a more fresh hop character. Did not seem to be dry hopped.
Delafield Hopfenstange Pils;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Delafield Brewhaus;My first one at the brewery in Delafield. Poured a clear golden with a medium sized white head. One thing that stood out which I later discussed with the brewer, was that it was noticeably hoppy for a pils- which I enjoyed of course. It just made it an interesting twist on an otherwise boring style (in my opinion). Some soft grapefruit and ginger notes underlying the beer. Aroma was classic grain, but again hops on the nose. Nice beer!
Delafield Hopfenstange Pils;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Delafield Brewhaus;Sampled during Great Taste of Midwest 2009 in Madison, Wisconsin.

Delafield Hopfenstange Pils;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Delafield Brewhaus;Pint at the brewpub. Big fluffy snow-white head with good retention topping a light clear gold body...fresh, mild grassy nose with light hints of acerbic hops...sweet, malty, bready initial flavor profile, reminds me of Portugese sweet bread...dries and thins out quite a bit late with a smattering of iron.
Delafield Hopfenstange Pils;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Delafield Brewhaus;Completely transparent yellow-gold in color with some renegade bubbles rising to the top, where a dusty white head and similar wrung hold dominion. Bright aroma with sugary lemon wafers, expensive dish detergent, and lollypops. An over-arching theme of cleanliness, brightness and sweetness. Interesting garden variety flavor. Initially thin and then an herbal character is divulged. Malt profile is generally shunned while much attention was devoted to the hop bitterness. Tingly, musky, dry and clean. Quite possibly a contract brew for Stetson Cologne.
Delafield Hopfenstange Pils;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Delafield Brewhaus;Clear gold color with a medium head. Interesting aroma that reminded me of honey. Dusty hops flavor with a light malt base. Wow... simple, yet tasty. One of the best made pilseners by a brew pub, hands down!

Aroma is some spice and fruityness along with some sugar. Flavor is a bit off with some candi sugar again and a spice but finishes with a stoung bitterness that leaves a sourness on the tounge. Maybe a bad bottle but this is not an above par triple. Alcohol is not a problem.
MacTarnahans Gran Luxe Tripel Ale;Portland, United States;Tripel;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Thanks to Tom at Pyramid for breaking this one out. From a 22-oz. bottle--Poured a golden-straw-copper clear body with a small, rocky head. Yeasty, musty nose. Vinous, cidery flavor. Hints of apples, pears, and white wine.

MacTarnahans Gran Luxe Tripel Ale;Portland, United States;Tripel;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);At first all I got for the nose was a snootful of soapy yeat, but as the head broke up, which it did rapidly, there was some sweet malt, cherries, and berries. Nice hazy amber body. The flavor is a fruity sweet malt, a touch of banana now added, and just a hint of its hefty abv. It has a sweet fruity finish with a low alcohol burn. Not bad. Binny�s Beverage Depot, Glen Ellyn, IL
MacTarnahans Gran Luxe Tripel Ale;Portland, United States;Tripel;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Not too much apparent in smell or appearence, the 9.3% isn�t really noticeable either.

Daleside Equinox;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Daleside Brewery;This beer is a load of shitte. I tasted corn in my beer, which I wouldn�t expect with a bitter.

Light brown on colour. Not as exciting as Phoenix beers usually are but still a good solid bitter. 2nd try At The Pilgrim in Liverpool Dec 4th 2004, much the same impression. Kinda fruity too...
Phoenix Bantam Bitter;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Phoenix is one of my favourite breweries, but this was one of their more mundane efforts. It�s a pale copper coloured, malt accented, basic session bitter. Clean and dry, but not packed with flavour. Perfectly acceptable, but nothing there to really tickle the taste buds. Cask (handpump), Head of Steam, Euston, London.
Phoenix Bantam Bitter;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Hand pulled at the Anchor, Birmingham (during their Phoenix weekend). Pale brown beer, which looks thin from the word go. Chubby, sweet rounded vague flavour. Slight bitter finish, and very slight overall. Like a less impressive brother of Oal Oak.

Wye Valley Dorothy Goodbody's Summertime Ale;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wye Valley Brewery;Cask@Chelmsford BF. Quite corny, but oddly as a slight burnt malt flavour comes through, didn�t really sit well with me to be honest, corn on the cob.
Wye Valley Dorothy Goodbody's Summertime Ale;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wye Valley Brewery;Beer #22 at Chelmsford Beer Festival, with Duff. I have to echo some of the other comments here about it not being a typical summer ale. Not that crisp and I detected distinct smoky notes in the aroma and a sort of burnt corn on the cob taste.

Roosters Silver Lining;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Roosters Brewing;Cask at the Maltings, York under the name �Silver Creek,� although the abv and style are the same - I am tempted to place the rating here until further notice, considering there is no mention of �Silver Creek� on the Rooster�s website. Orange bordering on copper with a thin film of dense white foam. Aroma is slightly indistinct, with slight grass, caramel, and dusty hops. Taste is upfront orange and lemon, with a malt presence dominated by caramel and butterscotch. Moderate to high bitterness, with a slight sour acidity in the finish. More lively in the carbonation than some.
Roosters Silver Lining;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Roosters Brewing;cask at Maltings York: dissapointed in this one after having the tennesse stud as my last memory of outlaw brew. beer has a slightly astringent aroma with some berry fruitiness.

The flavor had caramel and chocolate at the base with earthy and cocoa bitterness surrounding.. if you wait for it, a sizeable dose of pine bitterness emerges at the back and works very well.

Ringneck Amber Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;Nice copper body with a good glow. The head is definitely on the thin size but has good color and density. The aroma is intensely malty. Hard woods, toffee and an interesting scuppernong (wild grape native to the Southeastern US) fruitiness that I�ve picked up in a couple of other beers. A nice bit of fresh hops are floating around in the aroma as well. The flavor isn�t quite as good as the aroma, but it�s quite quaffable. The medium bitter finish is neither short nor long.
Ringneck Amber Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;On tap @ Brew Kettle: More of an Am. Amber than Alt,IMHO. Medium amber w/ a lasting white head. Compared to the Copperhead Red, this beer has a little more herbal hop aroma, malt is lightly toasty with a moderate caramel. Fruitiness is a little green apple. Flavor is medium toasted malt, light fruitiness, earthy hop, well balanced but lightly, ever so lightly to caramel malt flavor. Not terribly complex for amber style as it should not be, but highly drinkable. Finish is lightly earthy hop flavored as is aftertaste. Lighter body, maybe a little too light, smooth but dry m/f, medium carbonation. Good session beer due to lower abv, this one was 4.2, but not terribly complex. Given the 4.2 ABV, it might not be. I bought a growler of this based on drinkability as a session beer for New Year�s Eve, not because it was a great beer. But it does have a lot of flavor for a lighter beer, I�ll give it that.
Ringneck Amber Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;Slight malt aroma, but overall very little scent. Nice orange-brown color. A little sweet, malty flavor. Slightly salty aftertaste which I did not like. Very smooth. Not a bad Alt, but not a Long Trail.
Ringneck Amber Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;The Brew Kettle;The menu said Amber, but their description refers to it as an Alt. I thought it was more of an alt. Smooth, thick and sweet - full of caramel. A medium hop presence. Great lacing.
Ringneck Milk Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Brew Kettle;Bottle: Chocolate milk brown head lasts on a dark brown body. Roasty aroma predominates, but doesn�t overpower. Chocolate and caramel underly roasty coffee. Sugary sweetness and a very light fruitiness. Well balanced and roasty with a sugary sweetness. Very light chocolate and alcohol flavor. Caramel sandwiched between. Fruitiness seems low, but gets accented by the sugary sweetness. Finish is sweet and roasty. Body is lighter and has higher carbonation. M/f is smooth and lightly dry in the finish. Not a bad stout! A little thin on depth, but still fairly flavorful.
Ringneck Milk Stout;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Brew Kettle;Thick sweet and smooth. The sweetness was not overwhelming though - there was a good amount of roast and hop in this, adding some coffee flavors and a dry-er ending. Very tasty.

Ringneck Honey Wheat Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brew Kettle;Bottle: Light amber w/ a short lived white head. Sweet honey in the immediate nose, then hints of wheat as it warms and nuttiness. Seems to be also a little floral character, but not necessarily from the hops. Well balanced, wheat malt flavor and honey, clean! There�s a lightly tart finish that is sort of refreshing and a bitterness in the aftertaste. Lighter mouthfeel, but one drawback, it�s lightly astringent. Highly carbonated. Good lawnmower beer, not highly flavored, but better than macro alternatives!

The Brew Kettle Copperhead Red Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Brew Kettle;From a bomber. A lttle darker than a pale lager. Smell is sweet bready yeast. Taste follows the aroma, quite malty. Though quite malty, with a little caroub, not really over the hedge. A little difficult on a long swig. A little medicine builds during the session. Finish is same. $4.99 for this bomber.
The Brew Kettle Copperhead Red Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Brew Kettle;22 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass, the beer pours a clear amber color with about a half inch off-white head that went away quickly. There�s a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The beer smells like toffee, toasted and bready malt, and some light fruitiness. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there�s also a bit of caramel flavor noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it�s a bit slick and creamy and has moderate carbonation. It�s also smooth and goes down easy. I think it�s a decent enough beer overall. If I remember correctly this was just $3.99 a bottle at my local Giant Eagle, so at that price I�d buy it again.

B&O Station Juniper Berry;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;B & O Station Brewery;This was a guest tap at the BrewKettle in Strongsville.

Three Coins Sando Stout;Meegoda, Sri Lanka;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Millers Brewery;Smells and tastes like roasted malts with no hint of hops. This beer has a smooth taste and mouthfeel, but if carbonation had a specific taste, this beer has it. It is very carbonated, but not in a sense that it is brimming with bubbles...more like a sensation on your tongue. All in all, a good stout.
Three Coins Sando Stout;Meegoda, Sri Lanka;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Millers Brewery;Black and fizzy with small head that does not last. Roasted malt aromas, but high carbonation tickles the nose (not good). Very thin palate. Much too watery for a stout.
Three Coins Sando Stout;Meegoda, Sri Lanka;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Millers Brewery;Bottled, at Paddy�s Brewpub, Flemington, Australia. Dark brown with a slightly reddish hue. Not looking like the classic stout or foreign stout for that matter but still decent. If not for the appearance I noted that it was very similar to the Srilanken Lion Stout, just thinner. The gathering: duff, eczematic, Linc, motelpogo, Spiesy, Sully.
Three Coins Sando Stout;Meegoda, Sri Lanka;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Millers Brewery;Not too bad, but pretty thin and diluted for a stout. fairly tasty and easy to drink though. Sweet caramel and light roasted flavours, pretty flat however.
Three Coins Sando Stout;Meegoda, Sri Lanka;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Millers Brewery;17th beer of the night? Sheesh I did get there late! Horribly sweet aroma, tastes like any other weak sweet stout, short lived roasty flavour, touch of charcoal with lingering sweetness.
Boggart Rocket Fuel;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boggart Hole Clough;Cask, at Newark Beer Festival, May 2004. Notes recovered from a recently unearthed old notebook. Rocket fuel is certainly an apt name. Very volatile, spirity, lighter fluid aroma. Nearly black. Flavour is like a mixture of liquidised Pontefract Cakes (licorice) and Gees Linctus cough mixture and rubbing alcohol. And the texture is pretty much how I�d guess that mix would end up too - thick and syrupy sweet. Really difficult to know what to make of this. Leave it in the barrel to settle down for another year and you might have something a bit more developed and harmonious. As it is, its all over the place. A couple of extra points on the overall score for potential.
Boggart Rocket Fuel;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boggart Hole Clough;Cask Stillage at the Victoria Leisure Centre, Nottingham 16/10/2003 Dark and quite sweet with plenty of alcohol. Slightly chocolaty flavour to the lasting finish.
Boggart Rocket Fuel;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boggart Hole Clough;Brown and orange with no head. Aromas are sweet and sour with musty yeast. Not off - just not that nice. Flavours are yeasty with sweet caramel. Thick and sickly on the palate. Has a bit of the kit homebrew barley wine I once made. Stronger is not always better - this is a bit of a mess. Surprisingly, alcohol is not the evident in the taste. Have a Bonce Blower instead if strong beers are your thing.
Boggart Rocket Fuel;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boggart Hole Clough;"Dark coughing syrup, flows in the same way; not a bubble gets a chance. Bit of tar, and a full ashtray after a very long disco night - as well as the first morning coffee in a big hospital make out the nose. When I was young, we used liquorice sweet "" drop "" to make ""coffee"" with. If I had had a press with some Archimedes screw, I might have obtained this - without the alcohol, of course, but it has no more flavour. Well, OK, the finish is somewhat vinous. With tobacco ash. Syrupy MF. No, make that just plain syrup. They tried something. It failed. Is Boggart Hole Clough still operational, S.T.? Barley Wine?"
Boggart Rocket Fuel;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boggart Hole Clough;this is certainly one to flush out your organs. forget about nitrogen car kits, stick a pint of this in your tank and it�ll be goodbye today...see you next millenium. i think most people buy this for the novelty. beers of this strength cannot be taken seriously. dark, sweet and sickly. one of those you close a day at the festival with and to keep the fire burning till you get home. i really find it hard to rate this beer in figures. i gave it 6 but i dont regret having it, just wouldnt have it again, ive done my time.
Boggart Rocket Fuel;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boggart Hole Clough;Cask Conditioned at The Ship & Mitre, Liverpool. This is now the strongest beer I have ever knowingly had, though the 20 yr old Hardy's may have been above it. It is as black as the night with a red hint, no particular head. Imagine the Jollop the Doctor gave you as a kid to get rid of a particularly heavy cough and this is what you have but with an extra alcohol through the nose blast. Linctus and Bluebird Treacle toffee converge in a heady mix. Not for the faint hearted, but I've not had a cough since!!

Estes Park Hefeweizen;Estes Park, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Estes Park Brewery;Tap at brewpub. Pours cloudy but with a brownish mustard-yellow tint. Aroma is a perfect hefe: bubblegum, banana, and clove. This is how a hefe should smell. Flavor is soured banana with weak clove. Spreading mouthfeel.

Leavenworth Boulder Bend Dunkelweizen;Olympia, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;Not bad for a dark wheat beer.

Leavenworth Boulder Bend Dunkelweizen;Olympia, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;Can. It pours a dark brown/cola color with a light tan head. The aroma is roasty with some notes of cocoa, plum and raisin. Maybe a hint of coffee, but I think it�s mostly the roasted malt. The flavor is fruity with more plum and raisin. Mild notes of cocoa and roasted malt in the background. The roasted malt comes through stronger in the finish with a hint of ashy bitterness. The body is light, but there�s some oily slickness on the palate that adds some depth to the strong flavors. It has a raisin bread-like malty backbone. A little sweet in the finish, but overall a pretty enjoyable take on the style.

Sockeye Bear Creek Brown Ale;Boise, Idaho, United States;Brown Ale;Sockeye Brewing;"3/7/08 on draught at the brewpub. Aroma is solid roast malt forward with no hop flora; very porterlike. Appearance is clear amber-brown with a medium maintained tan head. Flavor is malt dominant as well, with sweetness, sourness and roast all even and masking low bittering with no flora. Mouthfeel is medium/high bodied with a good amount of creaminess, medium carb feel and sweet finish. Overall, good for not being to style, although the sweetness can get to you after a while."

Flavor is initially solid with roasty notes, malt, nuts, and a bit of hops before weakening out in the finish. Finish is a bit flat with some light bitters. Most likely just what the brewer was looking to achieve; drinkable by most patrons. Still, better than a lot of browns."

Goose Island Celebration Red Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);draft at brewpub- quite tasty- Irish ale?

Blicks Blind Side Pale Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blicks Brewing Company;22oz bomber-An amber body with a decent head and an aroma of nothing but maybe a little malt. Taste of the same. I was expecting more from the pretty cool label but I gues you can�t judge a beer from its label.
Blicks Blind Side Pale Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blicks Brewing Company;Had this beer on 9/29/1998. Color is hazy and gold, with good carbonation and very low head. Aroma is light with a hint of malt, but has a bit of a wine like smell to it. Taste is flat and empty. It starts with a light body that goes down easy, because there�s not much there. The finish has a slight bitterness but not much and no hop flavor at all, there is also no hop aroma. This may be the worst Pale Ale I have had, the body lacks malt flavor or any flavor at all, there is no hop flavor, bitterness, or aroma.
Blicks Blind Side Pale Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blicks Brewing Company;Fort Collins Brew Fest 2004 - This was probably my favorite beer of the fest.

Pocono Pale Ale;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lion Brewery;"From May 2007 Compliments of jwc215. Thanks again, Joe! This pours from 12oz bottle a slightly hazy orange with a nice healthy head of foam that shrinks to a fine layer and it has some lacing. The smell is a nice mix of hoppy bitterness and some bready and sweet malt notes. The taste on first sip has some sweet malt and some bready notes that is followed by a hop oil flavour and a bit of citrus and just a tiny bit of grass. Interesting. Swishing the beer in my mouth, the hop oil is the most noticeable flavour that I can detect, followed by the bread, and I'm finding it quite pleasing. Further sips in and I'm noticing that the finish has a lemony taste to it and that's something that I thinks detracts from my overall enjoyment of this Pale Ale. Lose that and I'd give it higher marks. Bottom line: A good Pale Ale that could be better if...see my remarks. ;^) I'd still say try it."
Pocono Pale Ale;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lion Brewery;"Now called ""Stegamier Pale Ale."" Bottle - from sampler pack. Colror is straw to orange and fairly clear. Malt and hop aroma with a hint of metal. Pretty good - both hoppy and malty but not the best hop flavor."
Pocono Pale Ale;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lion Brewery;12 oz bottle from a coworker. Pours a thin rusty orange with large clinging bubbles and a fizzy off white head. Aroma is harsh fruit notes, peach and apricot, rust, wet bread. The body is overly fizzy and thin to the point where I thought I was drinking seltzer. Flavors of bread crust, rotting fruit and cdopper. Blah.
Pocono Pale Ale;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lion Brewery;Pours a tranlucent copper amber with an average foamy off white head that left some lacing.

Pocono Pale Ale;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lion Brewery;Appearance: Pours a clear, orange-amber body with a half inch of evanescing, whitish foam. Smell: Sweetish nose of grains and light caramel marked with some spicy, citrusy hop notes. Taste: Blend of dry caramel and toffee with a flavor of steeped, soaked grains. Citrusy, lightly spicy hops provide a medium amount of balancing bitterness. Then, it�s back to the toffee-esque malt, though the flavor and body starts to recede at this point, but in no way does it approach being watery. Short, dry finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: A generally okay, comfortably average pale ale. Sure, you could do worse, but you could also do far, far better in terms of pale ales.

Redwood Lodge Doppelbock;Flint, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Redwood Lodge Brewery;Well, the sign on the wall claimed this as a dopple, though it is maibock light in color. It does have some smoky and spicy tones once you get it going, so it dopples a bit as it warms, with a generous, quick drying heat of hops. Interesting brown sugar note in the close. Definitely one of the most engaging and fun brews to try at this brewery.

Auckland Stone Crow;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Auckland Brewers;very hoppy aroma,clear straw colour with small white head. Yeasty flavour, not a true pale ale more like a yeasty lager. Typical of Inddepentant, sweet and boring!!!
Auckland Stone Crow;Otahuhu, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Auckland Brewers;It has a soft nose with a faint whiff of hop and citrus. The colour is of a typical pale ale, clean and light amber. The head is good but I am drinking this in the wrong vessel so cannot be too hard on this. Taste is soft and fruity with a clean malt profile. A bit like Little Creatures from WA (sorry Western Australia)without the presence of real mouthfeel. A good beer nevertheless. The only problem is that the label has an eagle on it, so why stone crow? Geez, what about starving the lizards?

Red Lodge Glacier Ale;Red Lodge, Montana, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Red Lodge Ales;Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance � The beer pours an amber color with a huge billowy white head of thick foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, very slowly fading to leave a ton of fizzy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell � The aroma is of a sweeter caramel and lightly toasted malt smell. A little bit of a grainy and slightly bready smell are there as well and are mixed with some hints of dark fruit. Taste � The taste begins with a sweet caramel and slightly bready taste with the bready having a bit of a toast taste associated with it. Along with these flavors comes some brown sugar and a little bit of a dark fruit taste. The roastedness increases at the end with the caramel fading a little bit at the expense of more dark fruits coming to the tongue. With a little bit of molasses joining the taste at the end, one is left with a sweeter and malty taste to be left on the tongue. Mouthfeel � The body of the beer is average in terms of thickness and creaminess with a rather average carbonation. Overall for the sweeter but more drinkable nature of the brew the feel is pretty good and makes for a smooth drinker. Overall � A pretty easy drinking and flavorful brew.

Castle Rock Brock;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Castle Rock Brewery;Cask, Theobald Arms, Grays, Essex. Dark stawberry colour. Fruit hit is huge, sweet and slightly sticky - not that pleasant. Some oak tones and a vague kriek flavour add to the general confusion. A strange brew.

De Brouwers Ambree;Bruxelles, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place;Draft. An amber beer with a beige head. The aroma has notes of malt and caramel as well as lighter notes of fruits. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt, caramel, and wet hay.
De Brouwers Ambree;Bruxelles, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place;Sample at the brewpub. Hazy orange colour with a small white head.

De Brouwers Ambree;Bruxelles, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place;Pours amber in color with an off-white head. A very buttery aroma with just about as much metal. Water, some bread sweetness, and a bit of sugar. Really quite bad. The flavor is just as buttery. Tons of metal, a mild malt sweetness, some water, and a bit of sugar. Barely drinkable.
De Brouwers Ambree;Bruxelles, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place;Draft @ the Brewpub - split a 120 ml. with ChinoSkillzian, t0rin0 and Womencantsail with enough beer left to spill for the fallen homies - the flavors caught us by surprise and we couldn�t handle it. A amber beer made by a brewer whose name in English means Brewer at the Brewers of the Grand Market - to bad they got dizzy from their creativity before making this beer. It does look amber - which if I understand the RB rules qualities as a 5/5 for appearance because their name clearly indicates this should look amber - with something that could be a white head. Smells of grains, burned candy and cough syrup. Metallic, caramel, stark, herbs, sweet metallic cough syrup, pain, malt, toffee,... Light bodied - I like it less than the Blond one but the ratings just show how ignorant I am - too ignorant to fully appreciate this.
Wychwood Owzat;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cask conditioned @ Humble Plumb, Soton. Fruity hops with a hint of citrus. Light but tasty malt and tangy bitterness which lasts well in the finish. Quite good.
Wychwood Owzat;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cask-conditioned at the Bag O�Nails, Bristol 23/6/07. Deep gold colour with slight head. Aroma of green fruit with a whiff of hops. Flavour of earthy malt with a decent hoppy finish. Ok, but it didn�t really come together.
Wychwood Owzat;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cask at the Red Lion, Cricklade, Wiltshire 09-06-07. Poured golden in colour, had fruity nose, but after a few sips this beer came across as being very tired and well past its best, credit to the landlord who totally agreed with me and changed it immediately, shame as might not get the opportunity to try this again very easily. Had this beer again at the Swan, Bicester, 17-06-07 tasted much much better, nice citrusy hoppiness, good fruity flavours very nice session beer.

Wychwood Owzat;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cask Conditioned at The Hobgoblin, Bicester. I can't believe that Nuffield calls Cricket boring, it is gods game, a tactical battle played out between warriors over 5 days of concentrated pleasure. Rather unlike this light one dimensional beer that tastes mildly of boiled sprouts. A hoppy finish saves the day.
Wychwood Owzat;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);"For those who have never had the pleasure of making themselves familiar with the wonderfully boring but gentlemanly game of cricket, the cry of ""owzat?!"" (short for ""How is that?"") is the proper language when you want to encourage the umpire to make a call--sort of like if all the fielders in baseball yelled out to call for a called third strike. There is no question about this beer, and that is a welcome relief because the Wychwood beers I've had before are nothing better than bench-warmers, and at worst deserve to be minor leagues or minor counties (depending whether you're playing baseball or cricket). Lighter golden color, decent head on a hand-pull, with a fruity balance and excellent level of carbonation. Fruity hoppiness pervades in excellent balance. In fact, I had another half-pint of this to finish the evening on a good note. (on tap, Turf Tavern, Oxford)"

Crouch Vale Amarillo;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Crouch Vale Brewery;Pours gold from the bottle. A thick, frothy white head clings to the glass and lingers. Aroma is a subtle blend of tropical fruits, but sweetish, more peach and honey mellon than citrus or pine. There�s also an odd hint of something I can�t quite place but reminds me of dishwashing liquid. Taste is mildly sweet, turning mildly bittersweet at the finish. Body is to the lighter side of medium, carbonation is mild. Overall, good.
Crouch Vale Amarillo;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Crouch Vale Brewery;"Cask. Warning - this may be a dodgy sample. But the main ""wonderful"" thing about the aroma is its absence. It's lightly hoppy. Also it's a cloudy orange where others have had it clear and golden. The top is lace but fleeting. Fortunately, the taste is okay. Fruity, but with a pleasant and moderate bitterness. The texture is slick and the body medium to light. Carbonation soft and bitter finish. I have said my prayers."

Crouch Vale Crouch Red;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Red Ale - Irish;Crouch Vale Brewery;Cloudy copper colour. A malty beer in the autumnal style, but I found it a bit dull.

Crouch Vale Crouch Red;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Red Ale - Irish;Crouch Vale Brewery;Cask at the Swan in the Rushes, Loughborough. Amber colour with white frothy head, good lacing. A roasty, bitter flavour. Light bodied. Not a bad session beer.

Crouch Vale Crouch Red;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Red Ale - Irish;Crouch Vale Brewery;From the Alex in Derby. Nice beer, not much of a Red colour to it really, more of an Auburn/Brown. Strong taste though lacking for something, maybe dry hopping would have helped brin gout the character more?
Crouch Vale Crouch Red;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Red Ale - Irish;Crouch Vale Brewery;Cask at the Ipswich Beer Festival 2004, gravity dispense. Crouch Vale�s attempt at a red Irish style ale - not a bad try IMO. Reddish colour, malty / toffee / caramel aroma, hints of oak. Malty caramel flavour with a surprisingly hoppy bitterness. Very good. A great combo with burger & chips.
Crouch Vale Crouch Red;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Red Ale - Irish;Crouch Vale Brewery;Maidstone Fest. Roasty Irish Red. like a cross between a stout and a bitter. But more inclined to the bitter. Nice.

Kenya Pilsner;Nairobi, Kenya;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kenya Breweries (EABL - Diageo);Light gold. Not much head. Kind of an appley aroma. Harsh and grainy. Not that good. It lack bitterness, but doesn't replace this with sweetness. Despite the references to eastern Europe, I don't get any of that character in this beer. Just another industrial lager, but maybe more of a low rent one, because it does use sugar and that brings acetaldehyde to the table in a way that eastern Europe's classics just don't have.

Gale's Crowning Glory;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;Cask Conditioned at The Woodmans Arms, Hammerpot, W.Sussex. Orange amber beer with thin head. Lacking condition, but nevertheless a fruity hoppy beer, good alcohol notes, there is a nasal whisky character.
Gale's Crowning Glory;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;[Cask at Charlie's Bar] The aroma is very light with slight notes of fruit - a somewhat weird aroma. The color is a slightly hazy orange and it has a small fine head. The flavor is soft, a little flat (cask), rich on fruit, warming, sligthtly prickling with notes of oranges. It ends on a slight bitter hop. A very fresh ale - very easily drinkable.
Malagne L'Arduinna;Ambly, Belgium;Specialty Grain - Other;Brasserie Saint-Monon;"Spelt beer referring to the Gallo-Roman age, with yellowish white, dense, moussy head and orangey peach blonde colour, misty, brownish with deposit.

Pours perfectly clear gold with a fine, creamy head. Light citrusy hops in the nose, fine biscuity pale malts. Light sweet flavor with mellow orange rind, other pithy citrus, restrained pale malts. Light bodied with fine carbonation. Fair balance onthe finish, slight leafy bitterness, further dry citrus, touhes of dry, pale malte. Nothing that wrong here, although the character is on the wimpy side.
Shepherd Neame Canterbury Jack (Cask);Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;On tap in Kent. Awaited a bit more but got still a full bodied flower aromatic beer. Colour was a bit to clear amber but all around this is a well done beer.
Shepherd Neame Canterbury Jack (Cask);Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;On tap in Kent. Beer pours in deep golden brown with a light but steady head. Tastes mild of roses, straw and is quite bitter and dry. Not carbonated at all.
Shepherd Neame Canterbury Jack (Cask);Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;Tasted this in the Bon Accord, Glasgow in November 2008. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale tawny in colour with a thin white head. Lemon peel present in the short tart aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a juicy grapefruit flavour with lemon grass notes. Dry dusty bitterness floods into the aftertaste with floral zest. Finish is hoppy with a metallic tang strong in the palate. A poor session bitter and not for me.
Shepherd Neame Canterbury Jack (Cask);Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;Had on tap in a Shepherd Neame pub in Canterbury. There are thousands of �em. I did not get on well with this at all. It looked slightly opaque in the glass and tasted overwhelmingly of vegetation. Not even any particular vegetable, which might have been interesting, just... leaves. It smelled like an elderly forest, in the worst possible way, and tasted dreadful. Avoid like the bloody plague.

Shepherd Neame Canterbury Jack (Cask);Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;I apparently liked this beer more than most. It was a very light, golden orange color with a minimal head that goes away over time leaving this ugly lilly pad looking bubbles that only a beer geek like you and I can appreciate. There is a light hoppy aroma.I liked it, the flavor was a little hoppy as well - very hoppy for a british bitter.
Ulan Bator Baadog;London, Greater London, England;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ulan Bator Breweries;Bottle from a now unrecalled source (historic rating). Poured an amber colour with a white head. Aroma of malt, caramel and light hop. Moderate sweetness, and light bitterness. OK...

Ulan Bator Baadog;London, Greater London, England;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ulan Bator Breweries;Brown 330ml bottle, this beer was brewed by a German originally, or so I am lead to believe. I have a feeling this bottle may have been brewed at the Celtic brewery in Ireland and then sold under license in the UK? Best before 5th August 09, drank March 09. Poured into a stemmed �La Chouffe� tulip glass (my current favorite). Certainly looked like a Vienna lager. Deep amber, old gold in colour, sparkling and with an slightly off-white head. Crisp and clean tasting but dull in the flavour stakes. An average Vienna, but a good one if considering its history (Mongolian or Irish). An OK beer that I couldn�t really recommend it to anyone, unless they are drinking round the world like me (and I�m not over confident this counts as a beer from Mongolia anyway!).

Ulan Bator Baadog;London, Greater London, England;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ulan Bator Breweries;Bottle. Pours a semi-cloudy, amber-orange with a foamy white head. Malty aroma with some honey and caramel. Crisp malt character, more honey, some citrus and pine hops. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Finishes sweet, lightly syrupy with some bread and lingering, fruity bitterness. Not bad.
Ulan Bator Baadog;London, Greater London, England;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ulan Bator Breweries;Bottle. A - Lighter caramel color with a smaller than average, bubbly and foamy, slightly off-white head. Doesn�t last too long and leaves a thin patchy lacing. S - Tart apple along with some citrus and other juicy fruity aromas. Competing and almost equaling it is a sweet caramel malt with a touch of bready aroma. Hints of bitter, floral hops come out as well. A nice diversity of aromas. T - Citrus, tart apple, and earthy and floral hops mix with some caramel and bready malt. These come in and out with varying strength through out the sip. Overall, I think the bitter/tart flavors are just a touch more prominent and linger just a bit longer. M - Light body with a good amount of carbonation. Fizzy and crisp with a bit of a drying finish. D - Pretty drinkable beer that is well balanced between bitter, tart, and sweet. Also fairly refreshing. Notes: Best before 06/2010. A decent beer that was better than what I was expecting. Well balanced between the flavors. Not amazing by any means, but a solid/decent beer.

Eumundi Laguna Bay Pale Ale;Milton, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);It is a real shame that the older versions of these beers were much better. Not simply because I yearn for the 'good old days' but really because they were better. I think that one of the problems is that the excise tax on beer in this country is linked to the ABV so to keep prices down the brewers have reduced the alcohol. Add to that the cost of cheap adjuncts such as cane sugar there is a real diminution in flavour. I agree that the hop presence isn't bad but there is a real thinness in this beer.
Eumundi Laguna Bay Pale Ale;Milton, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Import Bottle. Not bad at all. Clean flavor with a good malt taste, color is a little light for the style. Hoppiness is a little light, too.

Calumet Red Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On draught at the brewpub/brewery in downtown Chilton, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-clear reddish amber brew with a creamy off-white head that quickly dissipates to a fine film and white ring. Aroma of powdered amber malt, a touch of light yeast and citrus and piney hops. Taste is light to medium bodied, some fruity character of apples/pear, light caramel malt and citrus zest hops.

Calumet Red Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On tap. Clear medium reddish-orange pour with a short, rocky beige head. Aroma was a little weak, but harbored a significant amount of beery goodness... caramel, spices, and a hint of honey were in there, along with some floral hoppage. Smooth spice and caramel malt blend across the middle of the palate with bitter floral hops at the edges and finish. Medium-bodied, crisp around the edges and at the finish, and creamy-smooth across the middle. Medium-length finish with caramel, toffee, and light spices. Very fine brew!

Calumet Red Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Maybe I just drank this a little too late in the night, but this brew had a sour-mash taste to it.

Flavors of two distinct beer styles mixed together to make one uber-beer (see Calumet Bock). Need to get up here again for work sometime soon.

Stout Bros. Als Scotch Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Stout Brothers Public House;A wonderful and quite aromatic Wee Heavy. Probably the best of the 30+ local micros that I enjoyed on this trip. The peated malt and caramel nose was strong and proud, boasting a barrel aged-like woodiness. The rich malty flavor hinted of bourbon, caramel and campfire smoke. The easy finish left malty, tangy aftertastes.

Aroma is light sour with something that actually reminds me much of wild-yeast. Also hints of hay, wood and cherries. Strange stuff.. Light-bodied, average to soft carbonation and it has a mild watery texture. Tastes just as sour and acidic as the aroma suggested, with notes of hay and sour grapes.

Michigan Brewing Celis Grand Cru;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Michigan Brewing Company;Bottle. From old notes. With herbs and spices, by the original maker of Hoegaarden. Very similar to Hoegaarden Grand Cru, but not quite as good. Not as rich and malty, the flavor just is not up to the other, although it is a pretty pleasant beer.
Michigan Brewing Celis Grand Cru;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Michigan Brewing Company;This seems to taste like a strong version of Celis white! Bright, light golden color with a thin white head. Fresh vegetal/celery aroma and taste with coriander notes and some black pepper. Smooth, creamy malt background with a slight nuttiness. Good alcohol bite that I think seems stronger due to the spice herbaceousness. Spices last long after the sip. Another great Celis beer that I�ll be hoping makes a comeback soon!

Groggs Amber Ale;Helper, Utah, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pinnacle Brewing Co. (aka Groggs);[Colorado Road Trip � 2006] A nice brew t was a light amber color with a nice malt build and the hops where a tad light. This was a better beer to drink at this place. They need to reevaluate there contract brewing.
Groggs Amber Ale;Helper, Utah, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pinnacle Brewing Co. (aka Groggs);Dark orange, sour grain, bad and sharp maple syrup... seriously it tastes like maples syrup that was squeezed from some macabe maple compost pile. Some black licorice... with a lingering licorice finish that is not one bit enjoyable. Nose is the worst part, with a rotting wood and wet dog aroma.
Groggs Amber Ale;Helper, Utah, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pinnacle Brewing Co. (aka Groggs);Dark amber color with a good milky head. Smooth, velvety. Odd bittering agents, but it's OK.
Rogue Warrior Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Wow... Okay people, Dick Marcincko was a Navy SEAL and founder of SEAL Team 6. He has written books, had books written about him, star of a video game and many other things. His book is called Rogue Warrior, hence the name of the beer and his picture. The man is an actual badass worthy of his own beer... Not some damn entertainment wrestler.
Rogue Warrior Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;I picked up the bottle at the Brewery in 2004. It had a cool label on it. I honestly don�t remember what the beer was like. But I have the bottle to prove that I had it. I remeber it being basic but still great.!
Rogue Warrior Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Overly soft again for style. Low bitterness with some grassy hop notes. Somewhat English malt nose with some caramel and toffee notes. Hops seem somewhat downplayed for the style. Clean and drinkable session beer.
Rogue Warrior Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;"We begin our appreciation of the presentation by admiring the biceps of the manly man on the silkscreened label, presumably the Richard Marcincko that the beer is dedicated to, and what else does Mr. M. have to say? ""Thou shalt not like it, thou hast just to do it. Thou shalt Keep It Simple, Stupid. Thou shalt never assume. There are no rules- thou shalt win all all costs."" Hokay, without even cracking the crown, I've got my program before me! I'm guessing Richard M.'s a wrestler? I've also checked the ingredients in all my saved Rogue bottles to be sure that this is not a re-bottled something else, and it doesn't match up, so here we go... Appearance: a hazy, solid peach color, good, fluffy white head. Aroma: zesty, citrusy (grapefruit, orange, peach, more?), very fruity, sweet, richly aromatic, earthy and rare. Taste: unique! Substantial, yeasty, citric, delicious! Lots of sweet and tart hops dancing on the tongue, plenty of malt at work, gobs of yeast, still lively. Damn! Great tasting! Full malt, full hops, this brew ain't missing nothing is it? Feels a bit like Dead Guy...hmm, that bottle's missing from my collection...I'm not drinking re-packaged Dead Guy, am I? (It's been nearly 6 months since I've had one). No, I don't think so, though I welcome anyone to correct me. This is a substantially fruity ale, a fuller amber, a bolder pale, but great tasting to THE EXTREME!!! Another nice one from Rogue!"
Rogue Warrior Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Clear amber medium bubbled almost white head. Mild sweet aroma a combination of hops and grain giving this a different aroma but maybe I just getting to comfortable with hop monsters. A hop monster this beer is not. Medium light bodied beer smooth drinking a definite grainy flavor but not an unpleasant one. A floral hop flavor comes though a balanced beer and a great session beer
Rogue Warrior Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Hazy,oarnge/brown. Usual,Rogue,head. Lots of hops in the aroma with just as much caramel/bready malt aromas.Buttery,full,body. Starts hoppy,lots of malt in the flavor. Leafy hops and bready malts.Lingering leafy,hop finish. Dry and refreshing. Very drinkable beer,nothing fancy. Thanks Andre'!
Rogue Warrior Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;I swear this is a re-bottling of the amber ale. Oh well, still very dank beer. Perfectly balanced hop profile, sweetness to match the malt body, and a slighly bitter aftertaste that is great.
Rogue Warrior Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;I thought this was an extremely unique take on what has become a very boring and standard style. Nicely balanced with sweet malts and very tasty hops. Very drinkable with that aftertaste that only Rogue can produce.
Rogue Warrior Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rogue Ales;Aroma is very hoppy with a perfect balance of malt, lots of cinammon. Wow! APA?! Nice for this style! Flavor is slightly cobwebby with a dry hop finish. Very unique hop flavors, not bad.

Van Diest Fr�li Strawberry Beer;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;22/11/2019. Bottle from Tesco, Saxmundham. Pours pale reddish amber with a small off-white head. Aroma of strawberry and cream sweets, strawberry syrup, vanilla custard, touch of sweet caramel. Medium to heavy sweetness, light tartness. Moderate body, oily watery texture, soft carbonation.

Barleys Casino K�lsch;Henderson, Nevada, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Barley's Casino and Brewing;tall glass at barley�s casino: pale yellow with a creamy white head, some haze left in it still-either a starch or protein haze, but of course doesn�t have a bad effect on the flavor. light and crisp flavor like a kolsch should have, fairly thick i�d say. leaves an interesting aftertaste in the mouth i can�t quite describe. Not the best, but I�ll definitely go back to try it again and see how it matures.. may need more cold storage.
Barleys Casino K�lsch;Henderson, Nevada, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Barley's Casino and Brewing;Deep yellow with standard white head, authentic-looking at least, but maybe a bit too still. This is grainy, and notably more malty than my favorite Cologne beers, but I think this is one of Michael's best efforts.
Barleys Casino K�lsch;Henderson, Nevada, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Barley's Casino and Brewing;"Strangely, it was darker in color (dark golden -- almost amber) than any other kolsch I've had before. A little maltier than I expected also. How can they call this a kolsch? Anyway, mouthfeel was kind of creamy with some watery notes; medium carbonation. Honey sweetness exuded in the malts. Rather spicy, herbal, zingy hops caught me off guard. Had some rye-like qualities to it also. Only a mild bitterness, but the hops became more and more ""electric"" in the mouth. Curiously, they actually started growing on me. Overall, I enjoyed the beer, which tasted more like an experimental homebrew (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). But it didn't seem to fit kolsch style guidelines by any means."

Staffelberg-Br�u Loffelder Dunkel;Bad Staffelstein-Loffeld, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Staffelberg-Br�u;Pours brown from the bottle. Frothy off white head that fades. Aroma is caramel, tea, mineral water. Taste is mostly sweet with artificial cherry notes that come up at the finish. A metallic tinge lingers afterwards. Body is medium and a somewhat prickly carbonation accentuates the cherry pop flavor. Overall pretty nasty stuff. Even the less discriminating drinkers in the family wanted no part of it.

Timmermans Tradition Kriek Lambic;Itterbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Timmermans (John Martin);On tap at Weekend der Spontane Gisting, Opstal, Belgium. Shared with lovely Anja. Dark ruby red to purple, minimal head. Aroma is fruity, gluey, dark cherry, cherry brandy. Sour cherry flavour, cherry candy, light and watery, some acidity lingers on. Some leather, fruit jam, acetic acid in the finish. Soft carbonation. Very nice fruity character. Some sweetness.

Aroma muy dulce a cerezas, junto con piel de c�tricos y algo de caramelo. En boca, textura ligera y acuosa, de carbonataci�n media/alta y amargor inexistente. Sabores muy dulces a cereza, con un toque de �cido c�trico. Una Lambic de frutas que m�s bien parece un zumo que una cerveza. No es ninguna maravilla, pero quita la sed y es muy refrescante.
Timmermans Tradition Kriek Lambic;Itterbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Timmermans (John Martin);Fizzy drink with cherry. Definitely overpriced, especially for a 0.33 bottle. Honestly does not feel like a genuine fruit beer, more like some chemical imitation.

De Troch Gueuze;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij De Troch;37.5cl bottle shared at DHVL. Bottle from the 90�s. It pours a clean orange color with a minimal layer of white bubbles. Aroma is lightly sweet with oxidised notes of caramel and toffee and medium tangy funky, lightly acidic, with basement mold, musty notes. Taste is more geared towards the sweet caramel notes, with soft stone fruits, melon, lemon peel, green apples, some funk and barnyard. Light to medium bodied, with a silky mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Overall, very interesting and glad to have had a chance to try
De Troch Gueuze;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij De Troch;"375mL bottle shared by Vtafro on 8/13/16, unsure of exact date, but is said to be from the �80�s. Wine cork full insertion, with no cage. Fill is good; mid-neck. Deep copper-orange, good clarity, with a small film of white bubbles that show low retention. Very earthy, somewhat funky (horseblanket, sweat, cellar, must) nose is fairly well integrated between various acids and does show a touch of brett even. Seems fairly lactic, with a hard, yogurt/cheese rind-like character that is somewhat softened by a honey-caramel sweetness itself being a bit stale/oxidized. In the mouth, it�s sweet again, with a strong honey-like backbone, with notes of oxidized caramel and bits of simple sugar. Quite fruity and oaky, with strawberry, apple and lemon notes leading to a bit of sour acetic character and ending moderately lactic, acidburn lingering. Fairly well-balanced, quite easygoing, but with enough acidity to signify a lambic. Carbonation is light, but still apparent, giving a frizzante-like character. No alcohol noted. Interesting, and in strong condition for its age, but nothing terribly compelling here and a bit sweet/saccharine-like at points."
De Troch Gueuze;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij De Troch;Bottle - 1980s - Generation Lambic Share - pours orange gold white head - nose and taste of lemon, horsey funk, basement must, lactic acid and woody funk / medium body
De Troch Gueuze;Ternat-Wambeek, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Brouwerij De Troch;Bottle. 1980 vintage? Sediment in an orange pour. Actually some carbonation. Light fruit, tart, wild aromas. Flavors are funky, wild tart and oak tones.

Sheffields Pale Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Clear amber body with a soft, frothy white head. A unique aroma of strong hops and sourdough bread. Not too sweet or malty and also not too crazily hopped or bitter, but certainly interesting. The body is fairly light, but good for the style and good for the spring. The flavors are fairly well balanced and the sour aspects seem to drop out here, leaving nice, citrus hops, a touch of pine and some dry bread. A fairly tasty beer that�s rather reminiscent of some other Two Brothers beers: good, but not great.
Sheffields Pale Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Orangey-amber. Cascade aroma, with a touch of amber malt. Lemon, whole grain bread...typical straightforward APA. Good for what it is.
Sea Dog Summer Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Reviewed from notes. The appearance had a golden yellow body with no head probably because the bartender filled it to the brim (no worries). No lacing was seen. Gentle carbonation slowly rose. The smell had a bland sort of wheat. After it warmed up a bit, there were some light fruits and then the malts came out a bit. The taste was the same as the smell, nothing really different. On the palate, it sat very light with a decent amount of carbonation, sessionable. Overal, this is a decent summer offering by Sea Dog�s. Though I�d probably only have it again on tap.
Sea Dog Summer Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Draught at the brewpub in Orlando. Clear amber colour with a white head. Aroma and flavour of spice, malt, caramel, hops and floral notes.
Sea Dog Summer Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Clear medium amber, full one finger head, sheets of lace. Honey caramel malt lasts entire length with only the lightest bittering showing up to settle matters. Midway through the palate a touch of mild spice appears. Even though the hops are mostly absent, this is still a drinkable brew.
Sea Dog Summer Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);A nice, smooth summer ale with a semi-sweet maltiness. Pours rich golden with a short head. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Sea Dog Summer Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);"Pours clear deep golden. Toffee and citrus fruits in aroma and flavor. Softly carbonated. Very ""English"". Finishes lightly dry and citrusy. Balanced."
Sea Dog Summer Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Draught @ Sea Dog, Bangor, ME: Pours almost yellow/amber, no head to speak of. Grainy, sweet, vegetal aroma. She is no good. Harsh, very biscuity taste with a light, straw character. Not so good. Ugh.
Sea Dog Summer Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);"On tap at brewpub in So. Portland. Poured a nice, golden color with a very small, white head. Slightly hazy with no particles. Doesn�t smell too much like a typical summer ale; no real wheat to speak of. Smooth on the palate with a medium-lasting aftertaste, and a nice flavor (some citrus?). Goes down very easy; a good summer beer, but nothing really special to set it apart from all the other summer ales out there."
Sea Dog Summer Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Pours yellowwith a thin white head. Smells of wildflowers, dry malt. Tastes sweet and perfumy with a soft finish.
Kraftbrau Cranberry Lager;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kraftbrau Brewery;Strong and fresh cranberry aroma, outrageously tingly and lightly sour taste...good for a cranberry, not overdone, but not one of my favorite Kraftbrau's...
Kraftbrau Cranberry Lager;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kraftbrau Brewery;"Just a hint of a soft malt base and some German hop character rise through pretty subtle (as fruit beers go!) cranberry in the nose. Nice tingly blend of fruit and good lager underneath; not a world killer. Sour at the finish."
Kraftbrau Cranberry Lager;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kraftbrau Brewery;RBSG2003(extended) (On tap at the brewery) This beer rocks! Light golden, slightly hazy lager. Small, quickly diminishing, white creamy head. I smell no cranberry, but plenty of citrus fruit, yeast, pepper and coriander. The flavor is very geueze-like! No fruit, other than lemon. Lightly bitter. Well- balanced and tart... lightly tart. Light-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Short, tart, lightly bitter, astringent finish. Fun brew! Very Lambic/Flanders Red-like. It's a fruity lager, so that makes sense. World-class in my book.
Sea Dog Topsham Pale Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);On tap at the brewery. Pour a relatively clear golden amber with a medium sized white head. Soft malt and toast on the nose, a touch of vague citrus. Medium bodied, soft and sweet, malty fruit.

Sea Dog Topsham Pale Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Reviewed from notes. The appearance had a hazy golden orange colored body leaving a thin white head that dissipated within a minute and left a small square bubbly looking head that lasted a good five minutes, didn�t leave any lacing or rings around the glass. No carbonation was seen rising. The smell had some light hops I thought they were more subdued than most APA�s. There were some light traces of citrus in the smell. The taste was mainly the malts with the hops and citrus mainly combined and subtly coming back in the taste. On the palate, it sat at/about a medium, slightly creamy with average carbonation felt. This was mainly a drinkable beer. Overall, this was a pretty good brew that I would have again.

Sea Dog Topsham Pale Ale;Topsham, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);"Draught @ Sea Dog, Bangor, ME: I�m quite sure this was listed as ""Bangor Pale Ale"", so why the same company is also calling it Topsham Pale Ale is beyond me. Crazy Americans. She came a light pumpkin colour with a clingy white head and awesome lacing. I couldn�t pull any aroma at all. Tastes like a hoppy pale ale with straw, white bread and grass notes. Bitter and some spicy white pepper. Sounds better than it tasted, though."
Sea Dog Owls Head Light;Topsham, Maine, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);On tap. It poured a yellow color with a white head.

Sea Dog Owls Head Light;Topsham, Maine, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a transparent golden colored body with no visible head (that might have left before I recieved my beer, it was an on tap pour). The lacing was lightly spotty and left no visible rings. The smell had some pale malts and just a touch of hops. The taste had some malts and the hops, but nothing particularly interesting. On the palate, it was very light, very sessionable, no harshness on the tongue, no aftertaste, crisp, clean finish.

Sea Dog Owls Head Light;Topsham, Maine, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Clear light amber, light edge head, thin swirls of lace.

Sea Dog Owls Head Light;Topsham, Maine, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sea Dog Brewing (Shipyard Brewing Co.);Poured as part of a taster at the Woburn brewpub.

Schlafly Dry Hopped APA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;"I didn't care for their regular pale ale at all, but found this quite decent and drinkable. The dry-hopping and whatever else they do for the ""APA"" qualities work wonders. Still about average for the style though, and not really worth seeking out with all that's out there."
Schlafly Dry Hopped APA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;Pours a slightly hazy golden brown on tap with fluffy off-white head that leaves moderate lace. Aroma of nice citrus and diesel dry hop notes over a mild caramel and bready malt base. Taste follows, clean and hoppy, nothing offensive or over the top, but not bad. Definitely towards the old school, but I don't hate it.
Schlafly Dry Hopped APA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;12floz, BOD: 07.31.2017, $13 paid for a Schlafly mix 12-pack, nonic glass. Brass gold in appearance with a good frothy head. Smells like a mixture of honey, pine, and grapefruit. This is a very good all-around APA that I've had many times before. It's unfortunate Schafly has removed this from their six-pack rotation in favor of some dumb sub-par IPA they want to put out. Great toasted (a little sweet) maltiness matches the mild chewiness of resiny hop flavor. This was one of my favorite go to beers that I knew would be available in stores and often on draft...but I am only one beer drinker.
Schlafly Dry Hopped APA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap at Shamrocks. Pours a golden color with a decent head. Aroma of citrus, bit of malt sweetness and grain. Taste citrus and light caramel sweetness and grain. Some bitterness and a clean finish. Medium body and fairly smooth. Fairly average. Earlier Rating: 7/27/2010 Total Score: 3.7 Bottle- Pours a golden color with a decent head that slowly fades. Not much aroma, just a trace of citrus and hint of sweetness. The taste is citrus with a lingering bitterness, which is not a bad thing. It has a medium feel, continued carbonation and mildly dry finish. A respectable mid-range APA. I would like to try this fresh on tap to compare.
Schlafly Dry Hopped APA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap and made exclusively for Shamrock's. It poured a golden color with a white head. The aroma was of malts, florals and hops. The taste was similar to the aroma with more malts, florals, caramel and hops. It had a medium body with smooth carbonation. Decent. Earlier Rating: 2/13/2011 Total Score: 3.6 It pours a transparent amber bronze with a thin white head. Aroma of lightly crystal malt and a big grapefruity hop presence. Body starts with a nice pale malty sweetness balanced with crisp, citrus hops toward a bittersweet drier clean finish. Very drinkable without lacking in flavor or body. A good APA.
Schlafly Dry Hopped APA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;Solid apa. Lots of mild flavor. Very smooth and incredibly drinkable. Will definitely look to have this again ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Schlafly Dry Hopped APA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;Trying to remember the various great beers I had while bicycling cross-country last year. This one seems not too well known outside it�s local area, but is a damn good beer. I hadn�t been in the States for some years and was quite impressed with the improvements and availability of good craft beers (you are excused, Utah) and I recall going into a bottle shop somewhere in Middle America, land of Bud Light, and asking for something �dry hopped�. The knowledgeable guy in the shop sold me this. Full flavored, well hopped, not straying far from its style, it is a fine one!
Schlafly Dry Hopped APA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;On draft at the airport because I needed it. Pours clear amber, little head retention. I have very little to say about the aroma...barely discernible. Hoppy with an almost pilsner-y malt aftertaste, finishes bitter. Overall ok to drink but nothing spectacular, like most Schlafly brews imo.
Schlafly Dry Hopped APA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;"Slightly hazy perfectly coloured body of copper and bronze with a glowing orange tint and a thinnish one centimetre tall off-white head. Aroma of crisp fresh grassy and very herbal hops with some noticeable malt and alcohol. Medium-bodied; Strong grassy and very herbal hops with a bitter kick and some nicely balanced malt right behind. Aftertaste is rich and robust with the grass and herbs still very noticeable, but also with the malt and the bitterness. Overall, a nice APA with a big bitter taste and profile that shows well and lasts very long! I sampled this sixteen ounce pour on draught during a tap takeover at Whole Foods in Pentagon City (Arlington), Virginia on 13-February-2017 for US$4,00 at the end of my driveway."
Schlafly Dry Hopped APA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;From the Bonfire Box. Didn�t drink as fresh as I should have, but still is a nicely balanced mellow apa. Grapefruit, pine, grass, caramel and a touch of biscuit/bread. Moderate bitterness.
Lawson Creek Honey Almond;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;"12 oz bottle: Smells like artificial vanilla and a bit of honey and just has an artificial stench to it. Poured a pale golden color with a small bubbly head that disappeared after about a half of a second. Lets taste this bad boy...Bubbly on the palate. A big artificial flavor and adjunct taste to it. This is pretty bad. Just noticed at the bottom it said "" Malt beverage with Honey and artificial flavors."" Figures. Booooo!"
Lawson Creek Honey Almond;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;I liked even though most here bashed it...I would down a sixer of right now if it was in front of me!!!
Lawson Creek Honey Almond;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;"In the bottle from a cheapo sixer ($4.99). While this says ""light beer,"" I�m not so sure that it has any different formulary than any other Lawson Creek beer. Dark golden/pale amber color with virtually no head retention. Faint aroma of honey and an unusual odor that I can�t discern- certainly not almonds. Remarkably, this beer does not suck, if you consider that it is a light beer. I�m just skeptical that Gluek is pulling something over us here."
Lawson Creek Honey Almond;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;I�m diabetic and I should be drinking light beer but don�t, take my feet but don�t take my craft beer. I always try something I haven�t had before, so I gave LC HA a try. The aroma was pretty nice, sweet, an apple cider smell. I took a swig immediately and lind of liked it. Very cider like. Lemon/apple/almond flavors. Things went down from there. Once my thirst had been quenched from the first drink, all I was left with was a bland, extremely flat, near watery tasting cider like drink. I couldn�t even classify this as a lawnmower beer because of the flatness.
Lawson Creek Honey Almond;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Not really a head forms, just a small amount of scattered white foam on the top that looks like Greenland. Body is an light amber. Aroma is honey, and there is almond that smell veeeeery fake and extract like. Taste is fake.
Lawson Creek Honey Almond;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Bottle. Says light beer but not %. Honey and artificial flavour added. Hmmm artificial almond! Looks like a glass of dark apple juice. Almost no head. Funky sweet aroma at times like honey, possibly nuts and chemicals. Tastes like a macro beer and grape nuts. Too thin, not enough malt flavour, ruined by the artificial flavours. Glad I only have the one.
Lawson Creek Honey Almond;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Pours a golden color. Has a really strong scent of some sort of artificial sweetness. Has a really strange taste, something between a bad cider and crunch and munch. It is different I will give it that, and it�s drinkable. Not really a quality effort but I�ll drink the sixer.
Lawson Creek Honey Almond;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;This is a okay beer in my book. The label doesn�t say anything about it being a light beer like someone had stated but it does say brewed in America, and thats why i picked it up. Its a pretty decent lager that has me telling myself to pick it up if its ever 5 dollars a 6 or chepaer.
Lawson Creek Honey Almond;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Smells winey. Interesting twizzler taste, however, keeps me slightly amused.
Lawson Creek Honey Almond;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;I have to agree with the previous rating. This really does taste like a light beer with honey and butter. Watery and syrupy sweet malts predominate. I would never drink another bottle of this again.

Vascelum Pilsner;Barcelona, Spain;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Vascelum;Draught, in Barcelona. I'd been in search of good beer all through Barcelona, and finally I found something that was drinkable. In my best Spanish, I made some enquiries as to the origin of the beer. There was next to no English on offer in this place and I had my reservations about the authenticity of this beer. Then after much persistence and a flash of my tasting notes the owner of the bar was summoned. He proudly explained that he brewed it down stairs and proceeded to top my glass up quicker then I could drink it. All of this fun aside this beer was the best local beer sampled in Barcelona. Pale gold colour, with a slight white that leaves a sexy, lacy white trail down the tall thin glass. Refreshing malty aroma, malty, hoppy taste. Lovely finish.
City of Cambridge Sunset Square;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;City of Cambridge Brewery;Bottle. Orange and very clear. Minute head upon pouring.

Winters Golden;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Winters Brewery;...and three years later, a new rating. Bottle, picked up somewhere in north Norfolk. Deep gold. Nothing really that you call a head. Nose has toffee. Sweet wort. Hint of dessert apple. Taste is significantly better than the aroma, and is punchy, pithy bitter, with a little toffee sweetness. Pretty flat and dull mouthfeel. Pithy bitterness to finish.

Winters Golden;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Winters Brewery;Hand-pulled pint in The White Horse, Upton (Norfolk) on 26th Oct 2013. As the name might suggest, this was golden in colour: the small white covering stayed around for a while before retreating into a wisp and collar formation. A little more Pale Malts than anything else in both the aroma and taste: semi-sweet with a mild citrus note in the background. No huge flavours but a pleasant enough blend, refreshing and gulp-able.

Cheriton Pots Ale;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Flowerpots;Gravity cask at Maidstone BF.

Cheriton Pots Ale;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Flowerpots;Cask Conditioned, at the GBBF, 2004. Sulphurous but just a bitter. We seemed to have run aground with the beer choices at this point. Not that chris_o and I minded particularly but it would have been nice to try some more varied beer. My fault I should have been at the festival for more then one afternoon.
Cheriton Pots Ale;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Flowerpots;I found this a little disappointing. I suspect it wasn�t perfectly conditioned. Pale gold colour. Sulphur, and not much else, on the nose. Dry palate, but not that hoppy or bitter - just a touch of citrus. Clean finish, but a bit soft. I�m sure I�ve enjoyed this more in pre-RB days. Overall, an average session bitter. Cask, GBBF 2004, day 1. (6/3/6/3/11 - 2.9) RE-RATE 22/04/05. Cask (handpump), The Black Boy, Winchester. Much juicier and fresher than my previous tasting, which bears out my suspicion that it wasn�t in peak condition when I had it before. Quite fruity and flowery aroma. Plenty of hop bite coming through, but mellow mouthfeel. Slipped down very easily. Nice. Previous rating discarded.
Cheriton Pots Ale;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Flowerpots;Apr 06 Gravity Cask @ The Flower Pot Inn. One last visit to the Flower Pots whilst cheriton beers were still available and some had been pending a re-rate. An excellent session beer combining delicate flavours with lots of drinkability. 4.2 Oct 05 Cask conditioned @ Black Boy, Winchester. Perfumey floral hops and juicy malt. Quite simple but everything works together excellently. 3.8 Mar 04 Cask-conditioned at Flower Pot Inn. Flowery hop aroma with faint grassy and fruit notes. Hoppiness continues in the mouth with almost sweet full malty mouthfeel and suprisingly little bitterness. A good session bitter which could have done with a touch more bitterness for me. Must be sampled fresh. 3.6

Cheriton Village Elder;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flowerpots;Cask@The Red Lion, Isleworth. Very pale in colour. Malty, grainy start, weakish body, twist of lemon at the end, didn�t notice anything particularly floral about it. Was nice because it was light and it was a hot day, but otherwise i might not have it again.
Cheriton Village Elder;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flowerpots;Cask-conditioned @ Flower Pots, Cheriton. Summery aroma - flowery hops, citrus fruit, a hint of elderflower, some woodiness and rising bread. Some sweetness but well balanced full, refreshing body. Getting near the end of the cask-not crisp and fresh enough.
Cheriton Village Elder;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flowerpots;[Cask conditioned] Lovely aroma of hops and elderflower. Very good summer brew. Loads of hops in the flavour with a very pleasant touch of elderflower.
Cheriton Village Elder;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flowerpots;Wow. Intensely floral. In fact, one of the most floral beers I have ever tasted. Lots of aromatic hops, but also elder flowers apparently. Very pale, very refreshing, with some bitterness, but overall very easy drinking. Citrus overtones. Spectacular, or was the fact that this was the 12th and last beer (halves only) of a Great British Beer Festival session clouding my judgement. Remind myself to sample it on its home ground at the Flower Pots Inn (an excellent pub) next to the brewery. August 2003
Cheriton Village Elder;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flowerpots;"Cask, GBBF 2003 Golden Summer Ale. Citric aroma. pale golden appearance with wheat enhanced head. Good citric flavour; some woody, yeasty tones."
Cheriton Village Elder;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flowerpots;I had this beer with the cellar master of the Wenlock Arms. Beautiful aroma, hoppy, orange, lemon, floral. Theh flaovr lets it down some. Thinnish, slightly astringent, and chalky at the end. Yellow with nice, irregular head. (cask at GBBF 2003)
Cheriton Village Elder;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flowerpots;A beautiful ale from Cheriton. The elderflowers underpin the hops in a way that is quite remarkable. Great spice and aroma. A multi-award winning beer, with good reason.

Cheriton Best Bitter;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Flowerpots;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. Chestnut brown colour - rather dark for a bitter.

Cheriton Best Bitter;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Flowerpots;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - St Albans BF - A mid brown beer with a fruity malty raisin aroma but also a little sulphur. The taste has fruity malts but again is tainted, like so many beers at this festival by a little fartiness. Shame as Cheriton is top.
Cheriton Best Bitter;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Flowerpots;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. Another cracker from this top brewery. Reddish brown colour with good malt/hop balance. Bit of choc and good hop flavours. Superb. Really nice flavours throughout and excellent dry hoppy finish. Gorgeous.
Cheriton Best Bitter;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Flowerpots;Chappel Fest. The Flower Pot was closed for lunch when we went there, which left us in the lurch a bit. So I was pleased to pick this up at Chappel. It�s a toffee drenched best bitter with some balancing bitterness. Probably better at the brewpub.
Cheriton Best Bitter;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Flowerpots;Apr 06 Gravity Cask @ The Flower Pots Inn, Cheriton.

Cheriton Best Bitter;Cheriton, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Flowerpots;Cask Conditioned at The Flower Pots Inn, Cheriton. A dark brown bronze beer with thick lacy head. Malsts and soft fruit, sultanas dominate this beer. Some nuttiness in the second phase of the flavour. Harder to drink than the Pots Ale but more of a sipping bitter.
