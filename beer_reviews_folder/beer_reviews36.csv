Thoroughbreds Paddock Pale Ale;Leesburg,Virginia,United States;Pale Ale - English;Thoroughbreds Grill and Brewing;"Crystal clear amber coloured body with a small off-white head. Aroma of pale malt, caramel, cardboard and a faint amount of american hops. Light to Medium-bodied; Mild malty flavour showing some major sweetness and no hops at all to speak of. Aftertaste is bland and unrefined, the caramel peeks its way out and is roaming alone on the palate. Overall, not an impressive beer, but at least it�s local! I sampled this on �pseudo-draught� at the Old Dominion Brew Festival 2004 on 27-June-2004 in Ashburn, Virginia."
Thoroughbreds Paddock Pale Ale;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Thoroughbreds Grill and Brewing;ODBF04. Clear amber/copper color with a decent head. Not much in the head.

Thoroughbreds Paddock Pale Ale;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Thoroughbreds Grill and Brewing;Clear amber with a small off-white head. Little to no aroma. Where is the aroma? CO2 + H20 + sweetness = not a good beer. Nothing to see here please move on. Not the best beer for my 900th rating and my 100th Virginia beer. Oh well they are just artifical milestones that we humans like to latch on to due to our inate fondess for order.

Richbrau Hogwash IPA;Richmond, Virginia, United States;IPA;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);This edition of Hogwash was brewed specifically for the National H.O.G. Rally recently held in Richmond. Medium orange, decent head, good lacing. Hoppy aroma, with notes of grapefruit, pine, and a faint nuttiness. Flavor was a great caramel and biscuit backbone, with a hard hop kicking finish with plenty of grapefruit and a bit of earthiness. Best beer I�ve ever had from Richbrau. I would think they bumbed up the malt a bit from the earlier ratings.

I am not a huge fan of this style but this one does get about everything right.
Abbey Brewing Bock;Miami Beach, Florida, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Abbey Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Poured a transparent chestnut brown with just a tiny cap of off-white headage. Nose was of medium fruity malts, toffee, and a solid dose of caramel. Flavor mirrored the nose, and picked up some alcohol and more dark malt. Medium-bodied with some sharp alcohol notes slightly detracting from its goodness. Overall quite nice, and I really enjoyed the brewpub
Abbey Brewing Bock;Miami Beach, Florida, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Abbey Brewing Company;Draught at Abbey Brewing Company Miami Beach, Florida. Clear nut brown. Caramelly from nose to finish. Medium bodied and surprisingly soothing and drinkable for a berr it�s size. Behind the caramel some apricot lurk, followed by a lingering salty finish. Well balanced and fairly straightforward. Abbey Brewing Co. is, even if their beer is really brewed at Indian River/Ybor City, really a wonderful place to go and their beer selection is great even disregarding their house beers.
Abbey Brewing Bock;Miami Beach, Florida, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Abbey Brewing Company;My first Abbey Brewing, guest of owner and brewmaster Raymond Rigazio, and it was kick-arss. A bock? It reflected the taste and aroma of substantial yeast and could have passed as a Belgium pale or even a double. Boozy alcohol, golden colour. Balanced

A pale amber coloured beer with a thin off-white head and lacing. A very bitter beer but it�s not hoppy. Going over tropical fruit in the aroma. Not particularly pleasant with the wrong type of bitterness.

Tring Monk's Gold;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tring Brewery;Cask at the George, London. Clear gold pour with a light, white head. Sweaty, damp straw aroma. Flavor�s actually not bad. Some dough, light sugar, bit of weird tobacco and grass. Lawn grass, that is. Light in body with fine to average carbonation. Grassy, light citrus finish with mild malts. Decent.
Tring Monk's Gold;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tring Brewery;Rating is combination of 2 ratings 7-2-7-3-14=3.3 Cask (Live and Let Live, Cambridge) Gold, thin head. Light aromatic, floral, some orange and other citrus zest. Great to quaff, but doesn�t have any guts - weak clean lightly-roasted maltiness, hint of apple. Rerate of 7-3-8-4-15=3.7, which was much more full-bodied.
Tring Monk's Gold;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tring Brewery;Definitely at the lager-style end of the golden ale spectrum. Although there�s plenty of aromatic floral character in the aroma, the hop character fades away on the palate and the finish is too soft for my liking. Overall, smooth and easy-drinking, but a bit thin and lacking in oomph. Cask (handpump), Crosse Keys, City of London.
Tring Monk's Gold;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tring Brewery;"Lovely hoppy beer; tastes like Czech Saaz hops to me with their subtle lemon hints and mellow bitterness. The beer itself is pale and has lots of orchard fruit, but it�s those lovely hops which dictate the character. Bitterish, citrussy finish which is absolutely lovely. Class act, but how do you categorise this?!?!? (Cask @ Check Inn, Wroughton)"

Excellent lacing.
Tring Monk's Gold;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tring Brewery;Hand pulled at the Briar Rose (JDW, Birmingham. Yellow, with a type of orange white froth. Bready malt aroma. Almost salty dryness through the main body of this. Some golden syrup mixed sparingly. Proper Summer beer, not engaging enough - not spectacular. 1 pint was 1/2 too much.

This cask conditioned draft brew from the Cross Keys in London poured a poured a small head of finely sized mostly lasting white colored bubbles that left behind an excellent lacing.

Tring Monk's Gold;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tring Brewery;Crosse Keys, JDW, The City. Clean, dry, dull largerish blond. Some wheaty fragrance. Fresh. Citric notes. Better than a standard lager - but only just.
Tring Monk's Gold;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tring Brewery;Cask@Cross Keys, London. A golden ale. A touch of aromatic hops, with some lagery malts, a touch of kiwi fruit, failry plain, but easy enough to drink, not enough flavour though.

Suddabys Regal Ale;Malton, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Suddabys;Cask@The Market Porter, London. Typical English �Premium� Bitter. Not that intersting, but just enough to keep you interested, especially on cask. Some toffee and citric earthy hops, medium bitter.....and Cask@GBBF04. Not goo this time, heaps of butterscotch sweetness, slightly lactic flavour, caramel, toffee, grain, boring.
Tun Tavern IPA Uber Alles;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tun Tavern;Named Uber Alles IPA. Sampled @ NJ Brewers Fest. My favorite beer of the day brought me to the Tun Tavern booth a few times two fisting this stuff. Thich head and grapefruit aroma. Taste was the nice resin taste that I love in IIPA�s. Caramel and malt go great with the tangy hop taste. Best NJ beer I�ve had so far.
Tun Tavern IPA Uber Alles;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tun Tavern;Tap at NJ fest �04. Copper with a slight head. Aroma was not assertive at all, very little hops, and slight fruity notes. Big slick flavor of hops and malt, carmel notes and slight alcohol.
Ship Inn ESB;Milford, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Ship Inn Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at brewpub. Bright brassy gold color. Brief white head. Slightly tart malt nose. Flavor follows nose, with a tangy, cidery twinge. Some grainy notes. Hints of spicy citrus hops in finish.
Ship Inn ESB;Milford, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Ship Inn Restaurant & Brewery;No aroma. Pours amber from tap. Not much bite to speak of. Very watery. Disappointed.

Ship Inn ESB;Milford, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Ship Inn Restaurant & Brewery;Copper amber with a white bubbly head. Herbal and earth y with a light drying hop character and some sweeter caramel notes. Some light dried fruit with a chewy but drying finish. Good.

Ship Inn ESB;Milford, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Ship Inn Restaurant & Brewery;Gravity cask at Rattle N Hum. It�s from the end of a cask, but it�s still in pretty good shape. Deep amber-red beer with a thin lace of foam. Aroma is quite lovely. Soft toasted Maris Otter malts along with a light UK crystal malt sweetness. Aroma shows a kiss of orange marmalade, light herbal/grassy/UK hops as well. There is a touch of sweet caramel and maybe even a bit of coconut as well. Fairly strong herbal/spicy hoppiness with some lingering woody/chewy resinousness. The flavour is quite orangey as well. The yeast shows a nice spiciness and a bit of light estery fruit. It�s seems quite high in alcohol but it�s got all of the right components. Very authentic.
Ship Inn ESB;Milford, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Ship Inn Restaurant & Brewery;Couldn�t get much of an aroma out of it, but the coloring was a traditional copper color and quite inviting. Not much to speak of in the way of head or lacing, but that�s probably because the carbonation is rather low. Flavor and drinkability was very true to style, yet a slightly sour overtone (possibly brewed with extract?) seemed to prevail over the standard bitter taste of an ESB. If my friend brewed this in his basement, I�d be amazed. For a brew pub offering, it�s nothing outstanding. Very average.
Ship Inn ESB;Milford, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Ship Inn Restaurant & Brewery;Light copper in color with an ample off-white head, the Ship Inn�s ESB is fuller in flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel than their Best Bitter. Not from cask, this brew had soft carbonation, but still retained the creaminess of its little brother. More fruity and floral in aroma, and with a hint of alchohol aroma, the ESB had a shorter, but less bitter and more refined finish than the best bitter. A smooth increase in hop character from the beginning to the end of the swallow made each sip interesting. A slight tartness to the flavor made me order 2.
Ship Inn ESB;Milford, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Ship Inn Restaurant & Brewery;on tap-pours a tan head and copper color. Aroma is medium malt-sweet, musty. Taste is medium malt-sweet, musty, secondary hops bitterness.

Harvest Moon Czech Pils;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);As far as pilseners go, this was right down the middle of the road. Typical characteristics but a tad thin bodied. No real dough aroma which I find in most pils that I like.
Harvest Moon Czech Pils;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);Had this one on tap at the NJ beer fest. This was a very light and smooth beer. The clear yellow color and average white head gave way to a light malty flavor. The hops was a little weak, but well rounded. Overall a tad disappointing.

Gaslight Hopfest;South Orange, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Gaslight Brewery & Restaurant;Draft at the brewpub. Pours a copper amber body with a 1 finger white head. The nose is all grapefruit with a light malt backbone. Citrus and light pine, but almost all grapefruit. Pretty dam good.
Gaslight Hopfest;South Orange, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Gaslight Brewery & Restaurant;Growler from Gaslight in South Orange. I am a huge fan of the restaurant/brewery. Pretty good beer. Not very hoppy. I would expect a higher IBU for a beer of this caliber and name. Overall, i will drink again!
Gaslight Hopfest;South Orange, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Gaslight Brewery & Restaurant;Draft at Gaslight. Poured a copper color with an average frothy white head that lasted and produced good lacing. Good hoppy citrus aroma. Medium body. Moderate hoppy citrus flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of average duration. Best of the brews tasted.
Gaslight Hopfest;South Orange, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Gaslight Brewery & Restaurant;This draft brew from the brewery poured a large sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that was long lasting and left behind a transparent uncarbonated orange brown colored body and thick foamy lacing. The weak aroma was hoppy. The semi-flat mouth feel was tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a hoppy aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of malt and green hops. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
Gaslight Hopfest;South Orange, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Gaslight Brewery & Restaurant;Gah. This was my first pint of the night. Pour is ok- nice medium amber with a thin white head. Aroma smells like low-tide, sea salt, barnacles and seaweed, then some metallicy steel aromas, and finally in the end and as it warms, just a bit of citrus hops. The hops must have been pretty old on this one. Light caramel flavor with mor emetallic hops, and a wierd slick mouthfeel- ok bitterness. Toward the end of the beer I got used to everything, and it wasnt too bad, but I dont think Ill ever try this one again.

Shardlow Golden Hop;Cavendish Bridge, Leicester, Leicestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Shardlow Brewing;Cask at the Pretty Bricks, Walsall. Poured a golden straw colour with a thin white head and broken lace. The aroma is weak but malty. The flavour is medium to strong bitter with some malty notes. There sadly isn�t much else. It�s a nice enough ale but does not have enough to set it apart from the mass produced fizzy lagers.

Taste is a bit minimal, grassy with hints at sulphur salts, kind of dies in the mouth but drinkable enough.
Boomerang;Leuven, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Pours a hazy pale yellow-lime color, toppe dwith no real head to speak of. Mild fruity aroma, and very sweet, sugary fruity taste. No beer-like qualities to be noted, really. Not even a radler.
Boomerang;Leuven, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Hard to call it a beer, would be better to say alcoholic soda for this one so I note the taste.
Boomerang;Leuven, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);"Designer drink in between lemonade and beer rather than a real beer, already developed in the nineties by Labatt but now produced by AB InBev. Called a �malternative�, this drink is purely marketing and represents the beery one in a series of lemonade-like alcopops (which got a lot of bad attention later for allegedly leading youngsters to alcohol). Loose, unstable foam, colour a lemonade greenish. Very sweet and very artificial, lemonade-like taste with loads of sugar and ascorbic acid, lemon extracts as well, no finish. It feels weird to rate this as a �beer� because although made from malt and even (indiscernible) hops, there is litterally nothing beery about this anymore; for me this belongs to the fringes of what can still be called beer, which makes it at least philosophically interesting. Was tested on the Belgian market some years ago and fortunately I haven�t come across it since."
Boomerang;Leuven, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);It�s like a lemonade with alcohol :) Color yellow green (artificial), taste of lemon (artificial) and nothing else (Almost like a soft drink). With 6.1% of alcohol and with the big amount of sugar in it, it can get you drunk very fast. I don�t recommend it.
Boomerang;Leuven, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);not sure if this is the same beer. I remember back in my teens, i used to buy a beer called Boomerang, and it was brewed by Labatt, it was a heavy lemondae flavoured beer that i recall was about 6%, so this must be it. Well i remember it has hint of lemon, but man it was like mixing lemonade with malt liquor, just awful stuff.
Boomerang;Leuven, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Bottle. Lime sorbet colour. Lime sorbet aroma. Lemon sorbet flavour. I enjoy these nonsense fruit beers. The relationship with beer is remote, but they do use malt and hops. Crisp and refreshing. As far from serious as it�s possible to get.

Cotleigh 25;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cotleigh Brewery;Plain golden and no real head. Nose is fairly plain peach and puffy malt. Initial taste is fairly stodgy fruit, Farty grass. Very crisp carbonation and a light enough mouthfeel. It�s not horrendous but I�ve no idea why it�s in a clear bottle. Bottle, Comely Bankers v4 open door semi-al-fresco tasting
Cotleigh 25;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cotleigh Brewery;Bottle at Appellation Wines tasting. Hazy golden body with no head, carbonation or lacing.

Cotleigh 25;Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cotleigh Brewery;Bottle from Sidmouth Wines, Sidmouth. Amber gold with a very thin head. From a clear bottle so a little skunky, but there is some orange fruitiness in both aroma and taste, alongside some malts.
Griess Pilsner;Strullendorf-Geisfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Griess;Klare goldene Farbe, geringe wei�e Schaumkrone. Geruch sehr malzig, hopfig, s��. Geschmack s�� malzig, leicht hopfig, bitter, getreidig.
Griess Pilsner;Strullendorf-Geisfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Griess;"Fresh bottle, best by 1-28-14, purchased and consumed at the brewery in Nov. 2013: Rich golden. Scant head. Soft nose of lemon rind, lemon balm, minerals, fresh flowers, bright nectar, baguette, pistachiolike yeast, and wood root spice Spalt. Minimal carbonation, but soft and snug. Softly hoppy with polished lemon candy sitting atop pillowy and rounded pils malt. Impressively clean body supports a lovely interplay between zesty herbs and succulent lemon. Hops are remarkably soft and juicy throughout, with a fresh picked ""greenness"" reminiscent of fresh grass and appetizing nectar. Continued floral softness caresses the budding ardent herbality. Candyish yeast supplements the core with welcomed depth and rustic charm. Cohesive and clean finish is comprised of chewy pils malt, dusty yeast and a gently coarse minerals. Notably fresh fusion of herbs, grass and flowers linger well past the finish. One of the rarer examples of filtration improving a beer rather than stripping it of texture and soul. As with G�nstaller Zwickelpils, which becomes a world-class pils after having the doughy yeast removed, Griess kelelrbier also benefits from some light filtration and becomes a very different beer, as evidenced here in this delightfully transformed little pils. Great stuff."
Griess Pilsner;Strullendorf-Geisfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Griess;Bottle at Griess. Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is some shade of yellow (in stoneware). Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted bread), lightly to moderately hoppy (flowers/honeysuckle, herbs). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lighty to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/creamy body, lively/soft carbonation. Medium body, watery texture, soft/lively carbonation. Wow...seriously juicy and clean...didn�t expect much based on the two samples of the Kellerbier, but man alive this is seriously excellent stuff...no husks or dough or anything else to mar the experience. Big aroma with great malt and great hops, and wonderfully balanced. Shared two bottles with my buds and bought more to go...a must-try.
Griess Pilsner;Strullendorf-Geisfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Griess;Multiple bottles, fresh from the brewery in Geisfeld. Expressive Spalter hop lemon and mineral water nose, hoppier than the kellerbier if you can believe that. Soft, low carbonation, rich and succulent body, prickly hop acids, vibrant lemon zest, baked cracker / sourdough bread expression. Superbly clean, minerallic, zesty, rich, all components very bright and expressive. The lemon-tinged sweet pilsner malt is cut well by the minerally water and hop acidity, and each component is expressive and distinct.
Griess Pilsner;Strullendorf-Geisfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Griess;Bottle @ Pivni Rozmanitost, Prague. Pours clear golden with a off white head. A bit of grain, grass and vegetables. Slightly rough bitterness. Medium bodied. Perfumey and dry finish.
Griess Pilsner;Strullendorf-Geisfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Griess;"My Bottom Line : Slightly toasted, biscuity pale malts lend subtle sweetness to this mineral Pilsener, while citrusy angles and herbal bitterness seal a very drinkable brew. Further Personal Perceptions : -A veil of foam tops the dark golden. -The soft prickling and lean body made for easy drinking. -This is not your textbook Pils; it�s intricate and imbued with rural character. -The malts offered a little too much sugar for my tastes in the style. -Based on their Kellerbier, I expected a more salient hoppiness here. Bottle."
Griess Pilsner;Strullendorf-Geisfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Griess;"(bottle) Almost clear, except for some tiny floaties, golden coloured hue with a medium-sized foamy white head. Slightly grassy and herbal hoppy aroma with a touch of citrus and a light-sweet malty background. Bitter flavour, light to medium bodied, crispy mouthfeel. Herbal, slightly grassy hops-accented taste on a soft malty, slightly chalky base; dry and pleasantly bitter hoppy finish with a light smoky malty sweetness in the aftertaste. Top notch Pilsener in the Franconian way."
Griess Pilsner;Strullendorf-Geisfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Griess;"Bottle (purchased at the brewery): Greenish-golden coloured with a mid-sized fluffy white head; aromatic herbal-aromatic hops, underpinned by sweet pale malt; distinctive bitter-sweet flavour, soft, smooth MF; a faint hint of smoked malt (!) in the lingering dry bitter finish. A very fine stuff, Franconia rules........"
Griess Pilsner;Strullendorf-Geisfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Griess;Bottle, from the brewer, July 2005. Gold, moderate white head and moderate condition.

Bloomington B-Town Light;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;I had this at a beer festival in Indy. The aroma is barely apparent. The flavor seems lightly hopped with a malty sweetness.
Bloomington B-Town Light;Bloomington, Indiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bloomington Brewing Co.;On tap at Brewery: Clear golden hue, small head and little lace.

An excellent choice if you can catch on cask.
Hopdaemon Golden Dove;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;A beer that I have notes from the Railway hotel - ssh! This was the beer of the fest - great vibrant C hop notes - I guess dry hopped at the time. I just wish I could have those days back!
Hopdaemon Golden Dove;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;Cask (gravity dispense), White Cliffs Beer Festival, February 2005. Excellent blond beer with, for some unknown reason, the aroma of artichokes. It�s true, at least half a dozen people agreed on that. Another beer from Hopdaemon that I like very much.
Hopdaemon Golden Dove;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;Bottle. Felt unfinished. Melony and vegetably flavour. Some aromatic hops, quite sweet on the palate. Flabby mouthfeel, felt a bit empty or something.

Newby Wyke Slingshot;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask-conditioned at the Bag ONails, Bristol, 2/4/09. This was a good example of many English golden ales. Inoffensive in the extreme, not offering much by way of character. Golden, some sweetness, vaguely hoppy, forgettable.
Newby Wyke Slingshot;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Newby Wyke Brewery;Cask gravityat Reading BF 08. Gold with a thin white head. It�s ok, pretty forgettable gold bitter with some hop, not a lot of character. Some citrus flavour. Hop is ok, no more.

Bloomsbury;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Having carefully examined the pump clip and found no origin information whatsoever, and got uncomprehending looks from the bar staff, I had resigned myself to not getting a rate out of this one. However, I see that Duff has managed to track it down - well done. It was a pretty nondescript bitter - mid brown, fruity and not very bitter - but I didn�t find it as bad as Duff. I still suspect a Courage Best rebadge, but if Duff�s going to rate it, so am I! Cask (handpump) at the Jamaica Ale House, City of London.
Bloomsbury;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Cask@The Britannia, Richmond.

Montana Brewing Sandbagger Gold;Billings, Montana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Montana Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub. This was poured into a 10 oz. pint glass. The appearance was a semi-hazy golden color with a slim finger�s worth of white foaminess. It dissipated nicely, leaving some speckled rings here and there. The smell had a light sweet corn with a balanced grassiness to balance. The taste was mainly sweet again - combined sweet grassy to corn. A light sweet corn aftertaste ran about with a semi-dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a good sessionability about it. Low carbonation let it run really smooth on my tongue. Overall, I say this was a pretty good American Golden ale that I would have again.
Montana Brewing Sandbagger Gold;Billings, Montana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Montana Brewing Company;On tap. Clear golden pour with a white head. Scent is bread, fruit and some sweet honey. Taste fruit and grain.

Montana Brewing Sharptail Pale Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Montana Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. This seems to be modeled after Sierra Nevada�s classic -- golden/amber, firmly bodied, and with a sturdy-enough American hop profile.

Light bits of lacing. Sweet aroma of citrus and light florals. Tastes rich of fruity citrus hops, lighter florals, and caramel.

Montana Brewing Sharptail Pale Ale;Billings, Montana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Montana Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to footbalm. Pours a beautiful copper color with a thick frothy white head with tinges of orange. The aroma is full of caramel and some light hops. Quite nice, and a good start for sure.

Water Street Scottish Brown;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Water Street Brewery;"Pours a nice brown color with off-white head. Scotch tones, caramel malt and roast on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with more malt."
Water Street Scottish Brown;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Water Street Brewery;On tap at the Grafton location, and dispensed to a dimpled mug showing a clear, walnut color, with a frothy layer of light tan head foam, and spots & strands of lacing. The aroma was toasty, with some caramel, and touches of woodiness and butterscotch. Medium bodied, with appropriate carbonation, the taste also presented moderate hop bitterness that possessed some earthy nature, and a bit of smoke. Not a bad, low shilling Scottish, but the diacetyl put me off a bit.
Water Street Scottish Brown;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Water Street Brewery;On tap at Trinity. Pours a clear orange with a white head. No real lacing. Aroma has light sweet caramel, some brown sugar, and some peat. Taste is of lightly sweet malts and brown sugar. Not very complex and quite thin. Better than having a macro, I guess.

Pours a clear copper orange colore brew with a thin and fast dissipating off-white head that leaves behind a thin ring and no lacing. Aroma of multi-grain malt, a hint of run, some tart fruit and floral hops. Taste is light to medium bodied, some toasted multi-grain malt, a hint of butter and floral hops. Finish is semi-dry, some tart brown ale character that quickly disappears. Too light for a Scotch Ale, yet missing any smoke peat character.

Water Street Scottish Brown;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Water Street Brewery;Samlpe at Delafield. Murky brown colored body with a decent head for a sample. Was sereved with an orange on top of it and that seemed to be aroma and flavor. Did have a roasty malt aftertaste.
Water Street Scottish Brown;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Scottish Ale;Water Street Brewery;Clear brown-orangey amber body. Big malt profile featuring dark bagel, molasses, strawberry, and hickory dryness. There�s a grainy dryness about it, too. Big and malty, but kind of boring as well.

Elliott Bay Riot Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;On tap @ Elliot Bay Burien. Clear golden beer with a thin white head. Pretty decent fruit forward hop character to this. A lot of citrus peel notes of orange and white grapefruit. Sort of an herbal note, too. Definitely had some sweet caramel malt, peach, and perhaps even melon. It's fine. Nothing amazing.
Elliott Bay Riot Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;Tap at LCW. Brewery lists this as an imperial IPA, not an American Strong. I�d concur. Pine-heavy, very bitter citrus peel. Smooth mouthfeel. Little sign of the malts in this one, hence the style judgement. Almost identical in color to highline IPA, but substantially more enjoyable.

Peppery, hints of orange marmalade and wheat dough. Finishes dry with a bit of bittering and the 8% isn�t really noticeable.

Elliott Bay Riot Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;This was the fresh hopped version. Aroma is lightly citrusy and a little toasty.

Very tasty, and very easy to drink at 7.5%.
Pacific Rim Rat City IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Pacific Rim Brewing Co.;Draft at the Pac Rim tasting room. This is the dry-hopped version. Dark coppery amber. Headless.

Brew Moon Broomfield Brown Ale;Amberley, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Brew Moon Brewing Company;A beer I enjoyed in a sample palette at the brewery in New Zealand.

Brew Moon Broomfield Brown Ale;Amberley, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Brew Moon Brewing Company;I lve a brown ale, nutty autumnal pints of russet coloured goodness. This is toward the brown side of golden with a pillowy creamy coloured head. The aromas lean toward powdered chocolate and baking with shaved almonds and walnuts. Initially a cloud of carbonation and then sort of fruity and slightly stewed-apple-sour and cinnamon. It�s interesting, but not what you�d expect from a brown ale. It isn�t sweet and nutty, it has a character of its own and I applaud that. In a broader sense it is an easy drinking, tasty brown ale.

Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Cherry Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Draft at brewpub; took it off the chalkboard shortly after ordering it. Color was pinkish/orange; aroma was light with some wheat and cherry. Flavor was much of the same; pretty bland."
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Cherry Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Sampler, on the chalkboard just as ""cherry wheat"". Cloudy orange body w/ a pink tint. Light maraschino cherry aroma over sweet pie crust. A husky light wheat ale base with a slightly tart cherry element on top comprises the underwhelming (but predictable?) flavor. A pretty crappy cherry beer that even chicks might not dig :-)"
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Cherry Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;This brew has a cloudy pinkinsh/purplish body with a decent enough white head. The aroma is wheaty with a light cherry tartness to it. Not overblown as is many a fruited up wheat beer, this has a pleasant fruity tartness to it that makes this a respectable quencher in the Summer. Rock Bottom Chicago, Chicago, IL
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Cherry Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;Hazy, light golden body with the lightest hint of pink. The aroma is not as fruity as I would have thought. Some banana, some tart cherry, but more wheat and various cereals, a slight sour element, and a touch of spicy. The body is light and effervescent and pleasing on a warm, summer day. The flavor is more interesting than the nose, as more of the cherry character comes out. Tart cherries seem to go well with sweet banana and some light cereals. Maybe the best thing about these Rock Bottom fruit/wheat beers is that they do not become sweet alcopops like Lindeman�s Kriek or something like that. The fruit is present, but doesn�t dominate, it only compliments. There is a light tartness at thr finish which keeps things authentic. Maybe the best part is the subsequent belching, which provides much cherry and little wheat.
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Cherry Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Draft, at RB Chicago. My reaction was different than yous, but c�est la vie. I found it a very agreeable and refreshing lawnmower type of wheat with well-behaved charries, contributing more tartness than ""Smith Bros."" Pours a thin head on a cloudy golden wheat body, with a deep red center, like frozen cherries in a popsicle. The slight citrus character of the American wheat base gives it a ""cherry lemonade"" quality."

Goose Island Adoration Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Light all around pale with some nice body and a hoppy finish. Nothing to really stand out from the crowd besides it�s amazing freshness served at the Goose Island pub. The hoppy finish, as well as it�s nose was full of pines and grapefruit.
Goose Island Adoration Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Nice gold color with some deeper hues. Rocky head. Nothing spectacular, but a good ale nonetheless. Smells sweet and a bit spicy and hoppy as well. But not too complex a nose on this one. Quite sweet, with the malts just barely outweighing the hops in this one. As the description says, you do have some spice coming through. I�m not sure how I feel about this one hop summer deal, because it�s kinda wrecking the complexity. I dunno... Decent brew, though.

Goose Island Adoration Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Murky, dark golden body with virtually no head. Certainly not the most attractive beer I�ve seen. Big, piney hop nose with a healthy dose of grapefruit, lemons, oranges, caramel and light grains. The body is moderately full with a slightly harsh body considering the low abv. The flavors show a strong tendencies toward the intense hops. Piney and bitter with underlying breads, sweet caramel and some whole grains. The finish is long and bitter and has little room for balancing malt. Not overly impressive with its lack of balance and strong bitterness. With that in mind, it�s an otherwise tasty beer.
Goose Island Adoration Pale Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"Draft, Goose Island. A nice, mild ale with a subdued character, just a touch of bitterness, but it builds in the aftertaste. This is lighter than the Hopscotch ale I just had, but its taste is just a bit ""bigger,"" even with a very light color. Hop taste becomes predonomiant at the end for a bigger finish."

Tastes spicy, yeasty, hoppy, with a solid malt bill and a fairly smooth finish. Thisone straddles the line between a Belgian pale and a lower level tripel, woth hefty rock sugary malt throughout. You won�t like this is you don;t like Belgian beers, but if you do, then I trust you�ll appreciate the flavor and aroma this one provides."

Legend Belgian Style Pale Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Legend Brewing Company;Sparkling clear amber with a foamy off-white head.

Crystal clear pale gold in colour with a thin white head. Lemony notes in the short aroma. Thin but refreshing mouthfeel and good lacing.

Cottage Anniversary Ale;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cottage Brewing;Cask-conditioned @ JDW, Soton. Golden with thin lasting head. Beautifully uncomplicated hop aroma - dusty, woody with a touch of citrus fruit but at the same time restrained and delicate. Firm malt body and lots of balancing bitterness. Very well balanced and quaffable. A pleasant contrast to Cotleigh 25 which I recently had, both are anniversary beers and both breweries have aimed (I think) to brew something well balanced and simple. Whilst Cotleigh 25 was pretty boring, Cottage Anniversary was delightfully balanced but had very little going on.

Weiss-R�ssl Hefeweizen Hell;Rossstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Weiss-R�ssl-Br�u (Arcobr�u);Pours orange from the bottle with a huge, foamy head that rapidly settles. The aroma is banana, fresh corn, hints of rubber. Taste is banana sweet, turning lightly tart with hints of lemon at the finish. Body is medium, but light watery hints come through at time, and on top of this the alcohol is not perfectly hidden. So overall, a beer with a few flaws and a bit below average for the style, but not a disaster. I had no problems finishing the bottle.
Weiss-R�ssl Hefeweizen Hell;Rossstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Weiss-R�ssl-Br�u (Arcobr�u);Tastes like a 08/15 Weizenbeer but the yeast note is missing. Not bad but nothing special.

Bercloise Ambr�e;Bercloux, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bercloux;From bottle in a cafe in Talmont-sur-Gironde, France 23/8/07. Amber coloured with a slight white head. Aroma of sweet red fruit.

Bercloise Ambr�e;Bercloux, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bercloux;Bottle: Poured a clear amber colored beer with a medium head with more or less of retention. Aroma is quite special and the only way I can describe this is like very salty corn. Taste is also very similar to the aroma and reminiscent of fresh corn with salt and ending with a smoke feeling. The label mentioned cognac being used in this beer and I�m not sure of the impact of this on the beer. I�m not sure I would drink this on a regular basis but not too bad as a one off.

Heartland Matrimony Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Greenpoint Beer Works;On draft at brewpub. This Belgian style beauty shown a hazy goldent-amber color in the glass with a thin white head that leaves heavy lacing. Aroma is fruity, spicy and bready (quite nice), sweet with fragrant belgian yeastiness, citrus notes and wild flowers. Features an excellent blend of tart and sweet flavors,crisp and clean with lots of citrus and spice (like sweet bread with candied orange), lemon, floral hops and a lingering spicy aftertaste. Light and clean on the palate, crisply assertive carbonation and leaves a dry sensation on the tongue.
Heartland Matrimony Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Greenpoint Beer Works;Tap at the Empire State location. Slightly hazy pale amber beer.

This ain�t no saison and it�s not even a very good pale ale.
Heartland Matrimony Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Greenpoint Beer Works;Cloudy golden in colour. Aroma was rather light with some hops, fruit and not nearly enought sourness or funkiness that you should get in a saison. Flavour of citrus (oranges and lemones), slight sourness. Medium body and high carbonation. Finishes with a mild bitterness.
Heartland Matrimony Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Greenpoint Beer Works;On tap at Union Square. Poured an opaque light orange with yellow at the bottom. The aroma was reminiscent of peaches, almost like those slices of peaches you get in the cans that have a sweetness to them. Taste had a slight bite to it, with some yeast and malt coming through but also the taste of like black plums.

Westons Family Reserve Oak Matured Cider;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;Bottle. Quite a pale gold colour. Aroma is apples with perhaps some background oak. Quite sweet for a medium dry, but it gets away with it. The oak is more noticable in the taste. Pleasant cider.
Westons Family Reserve Oak Matured Cider;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;I�m a bit disappointed and pleased with Tesco at the same time. Due to the lack of new beers in their beer range, I have been forced to buy their ciders in order to get a scoop in this shop. However, it has meant that I started to drink cider again. Woody cider aroma with sweetish apple juie in the mouth.Like Chris this is on the sweet side of medium dry. Woodiness develops in the mouth to the finish. Bit of rubber on the aroma. Finish as a drying juicy feel. Drinkable if not stunning.

Coach House Ginger Nut Premium;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Coach House Brewing Co.;Cask gravity at the Watford Beer Festival 2014. Poured a clear, deep golden colour, with a halo of whit head. Aroma of stem ginger, honey and green apples. More ginger in the flavour, with malt and caramel.

Coach House Ginger Nut Premium;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Coach House Brewing Co.;Cask gravity at the Watford beer festival 2014. Pale golden coloured pour with a fleeting white head. Aroma is stale ginger nut biscuit, bit spicy. Flavour is horrible alcohol and ginger biscuit, soggy and stale biscuit. Palate is flabby and dull, hot alcohol solvent. Terrible.
Coach House Ginger Nut Premium;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Coach House Brewing Co.;Maidstone Fest. Sweet ginger flavoured premium bitter with a dusty finish and some sulphury notes.
Coach House Ginger Nut Premium;Warrington, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Coach House Brewing Co.;As the name would suggest, this beer is made with the addition of ginger. The surprise is that the ginger doesn�t come through at all clearly in the aroma, but asserts itself as a very marked spicy note in the flavour, although I�m not sure I would have identified the spice as ginger had the name not made it obvious. However, the ginger doesn�t overwhelm. The downside of that is that nothing else asserts itself to any extent. It all just seems a bit watery and sweetish. Overall, not bad though. Cask (handpump), Lord Moon of the Mall (JDW), Whitehall, London SW1.
Cottage Windsor Castle;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;"Cask at the Rose & Crown, Sandhurst. A pale amber pour with a loose white head; fresh grassy aroma; soft grainy body; and a crisp grassy bitterness. A very basic Golden Ale. Possibly a completely different beer to earlier ratings, with the name reused in time for the Queen�s 90th birthday - there�s still a steam engine on the pump clip though."
Cottage Windsor Castle;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask @ Pratts and Payne. Hazy golden colour. Little aroma - some citrus, malt and maybe honey.

Cottage Windsor Castle;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask conditioned at The Woolpack, Banbury. Brown amber with white head.Unremarkable beer, stuck between a faint rich maltiness and a fruity hop and achieves neither. Absolutely fresh on tap so it must be the Brewer.
Cottage Windsor Castle;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Amber body with a fine clinging head. Malty aroma which tells no lies. This beer is solely about the malt. No hops are present and its character and flavour are built solely around the malt base. So in summary the beer is one dimensional and rather boring. Perhaps it would be more acceptable in winter.
Cottage Windsor Castle;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask@The Brewery Tap, Wimbledon.Bready, grainy malts. Bitter earthy hops, some burnt honey in the flavour, not a winner with me, but perfectly drinkable.
Cottage Windsor Castle;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Well I do declare, another respectable but unspectacular beer from Cottage at the Head of Steam. Basically, it�s a strongish, middle of the road bitter. Cottage seem to have got bored with whippets for now and reverted to railway themed beers. This one has a steam train, not a castle on the pump clip. Cask (handpump).

King Arthur's Olde English Ale;Oswego, New York, United States;Strong Ale - English;King Arthurs Steakhouse & Brewery;Sampled at brewpub with Lubiere.

King Arthur's Olde English Ale;Oswego, New York, United States;Strong Ale - English;King Arthurs Steakhouse & Brewery;On tap, July 17, 2005. Golden ale with no head. Sweet malts with perfumey notes. Caramle malts with solvent notes, grainy malts with light alcohol. Boring.
King Arthur's Olde English Ale;Oswego, New York, United States;Strong Ale - English;King Arthurs Steakhouse & Brewery;"this beer is nice, very nice. pale coper/amber colour, slight presence of lacings, low carbonation with no nitro ruining it. Palat is oily, flavour is mild presnece of sweet malt, citrus/herbal hops, not enough hops but good hops. Undertones malt syrop, earthtones, and I mest agree with ""Rastacouere"" it is a little soapy. This is mislabeled. in England this would be called a ""Best Bitter"" it has all the caracteristics of one. I normaly get excited when I hear "" Olde English Ale"" cuz I am expecting a beer that folows the mid-evil/renesance deffonition of ale. In those days all yeast in england was what we would now call ale fermentation, but back then it was called ""Beer"" when it contained hops, and ""Ale"" was completly hop free. Just once I would like to go to a renacance fair/themed pub and my ale goblet to contain a cloudy fermented pure malt hop free liquid instead of modern beers with OLDE in the name. Cheers"

Creamy grain nose, sweet and soapy, oily, herbal and floral goldings. Fairly oxidized, stale earthiness. Orangey hops feel just as old as the grainy malts. Oily yet very thin mouthfeel, flat and lifeless.

King Arthur's Olde English Ale;Oswego, New York, United States;Strong Ale - English;King Arthurs Steakhouse & Brewery;3-4 oz draught sample. Nose is disappointing, virtually no aroma. Pours a bubbly slightly darker transparent blonde than their golden ale. Astringent start, leading to some wateriness in the middle. Grainy and bitter to finish. The brewmaster told me he used 100% Maris Otter with this one, but I couldnt appreciate it.
King Arthur's Sir Gawaine Amber Ale;Oswego, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;King Arthurs Steakhouse & Brewery;Red copper ale with sweet strawberry aroma and nice butterscotch notes. Very fruity amber ale with nutty notes, almost like almonds. Medium bodied. On tap February 4, 2005.
King Arthur's Sir Gawaine Amber Ale;Oswego, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;King Arthurs Steakhouse & Brewery;3-4 oz draught sample. Pleasantly sweet and malty aroma with some brown sugar and caramel notes. Transparent honey/orange color with off-white frothy head and nice lacing. Start is smooth slightly sweet and malty. Finishes very very bitter and very dry. Way too overhopped for an amber IMO. This has potential, but needs to get much mellower.

Oulton Windswept;Lowestoft, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oulton Ales;Cask (gravity dispense), Chelmsford Beer Festival, July 2005. Although it was in the programme as Windlass, I�m pretty sure it was actually this beer. Cloudy amber colour, but things picked up from there. Powerful hop aroma - strongly herbaceous with grass and hay notes. It has that gooseberry leaf aroma characteristic of wines made with Sauvignon Blanc. More grassy stuff in the flavour and a good hit of citric grapefruit. Firm mouthfeel with plenty of grip. Very crisp and refreshing. A nice drop.
Oulton Windswept;Lowestoft, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oulton Ales;Cask@Kingston Beer festival. Malty to start, some caramel/toffee.

King Arthur's Merlins Mystical Porter;Oswego, New York, United States;Porter;King Arthurs Steakhouse & Brewery;3-4 oz draught sample. Slight pine notes in the nose. Not much in the way of roasted malts. Almost opaque dark drown with a nice creamy light tan head. Wow--black licorice. Some mild cocoa notes to start at the very start, but then leading way to a huge blast of black licorice. Some faint roasted malts come through at the end. Unfortunately, the licorice is way overpowering for a porter. Aroma needs some help.
King Arthur's Mild Ale;Oswego, New York, United States;Mild Ale;King Arthurs Steakhouse & Brewery;Unfortunately, I could not get a description of this beer on the website and the contact form is not working. This is truly unfortunate because it was the best of the 6 beers they had on tap. 3-4 oz draught sample. This has a malty sweet brown sugar aroma. The pour is a transparent dark almost mahogany color with virtually no head. Sweet, caramel, brown sugar greets your palate. Spiciness in the middle with smooth maltiness to finish. Well-balanced and adequately complex. Nice work.

Big Horn Amber Light;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Well the bartender told me this is just a mix of their amber and light beers made as a seasonal summer brew. Porus a amber color with a small white head. Aroma is very faint with a slight malty smell to it. Taste starts malty and ends with a slight bitternes, but keep in mind that this should be taken and divided by 2 to get the truth, this sucks squared.

Ridiculously sweet, loads of chemicals and I would prefer to drink coles reconstituted apple juice mixed 50/50 with grappa. Another fucking shocking cider from Carlsberg.

Clear pale amber in colour with a thin white head. Dry dusty hop aroma with green apples present. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing.

Tut-Anch-Ueli;Basel, Switzerland;Flavored - Fruit;Fischerstube;"01-May-14 (330-ml bottle: Obtained in trade with bogdi1, thanks Juha!) This beer pours a hazy, golden-amber body with a thin, off-white head. The nose has a light, honey-sweet aroma with bready and slightly toasty malt. The malt base has a yeasty, bready flavor with a light toastiness. It�s lightly sweet, some honey character, some nuttiness, but only a vague hint at dates. The beer is medium in weight, low in carbonation, and easy and smooth on the palate. Overall, this is a pretty simple beer, easy to drink, not particularly noteworthy. I question if this is close to an ""ancient Egyptian recipe"" though...at best, this just employs some of the ancient ingredients into a otherwise modern beer."
Tut-Anch-Ueli;Basel, Switzerland;Flavored - Fruit;Fischerstube;Das Ganze ist ein ziemlich unspektakul�res Bier.

Tut-Anch-Ueli;Basel, Switzerland;Flavored - Fruit;Fischerstube;Small white head, fed by very fine pearly carbonation from metallic-golden beer. Sweet nose, fruity, obviously the dates, but my nose says dried figs, and a bit of oxydation, �t would seem. More oxydized, quite sweet malts. Fruits on sugar: figs, oranges, maybe dates too. Rather light, near empty MF, slight end slickness. Remarkable. Somebody told me once that pale malts have existed for a good 150 years. Now it would appear the ancient Egyptians had already the same. Markus, where do you keep getting them?
Tut-Anch-Ueli;Basel, Switzerland;Flavored - Fruit;Fischerstube;"Bottled 33cl. It pours a golden beer with a small head. Aromas of marmelade, molasses, dates; rather sweet. A quite toasty nose. Hints of rich fruits, oily. The taste is sweet and not that overly flavorful. Very toasty, biscuity. Slightly oily. Faint bitter finish with some dates showing up. I really wonder what the beer tasted like the ancient Egyptians used to have."

Tut-Anch-Ueli;Basel, Switzerland;Flavored - Fruit;Fischerstube;Sweet citrus and a little dades aroma. Golden color, off-white head that disappears fast but not completely, no lace. Sweet, very light bitter, lightly hopped, bit fruity (dades?), little syrupy. Brewed for Fischerstube, Basel, CH.

Jaxons Maibock;El Paso, Texas, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Jaxons Restaurant & Brewing Co.;The Maibock pours a light brown-to-orange with minimal off-white head. There�s some roast, some hops, and some spice. It favors the citrusy or coriander-ish flavors more than Jaxon�s hefeweizen and doesn�t have quite as much of the floral musk. I can�t tell if this beer really knows what it wants to be, but it�s not bad by any means.

Delafield Imperial IPA;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Delafield Brewhaus;Served in a snifter at the brewpub. Attractive toffee amber tan unfiltered opaque body. Steady creamy off-white head. Has a cask-like body. The dry hopping really helped this one. Classical IPA backbone. The citra, simcoe, cascade hop bill is really great. Far and away the best beer I�ve had from Delafield. Very full and rich for the 8.5%, probably a lot of residual sugars. Not great, but a pleasant surprise.
Delafield Imperial IPA;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Delafield Brewhaus;Draft at the brewpub. Murky copper color. Drinks with a very distinctly pineapple-heavy, tropical fruit character. Creamy at first but overall interestingly light. But then that weird chemical finish they had in at least one other brew rears up ... (#5096, 7/2/2013)
Delafield Imperial IPA;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Delafield Brewhaus;On tap at Delafield Brewhaus, marked as 11.5%. Poured clear, deep amber with a sticky, well-retained off-white head.. loved the color. The aroma picked up juicy darker fruits, pine, and peppery notes over warm caramel and lesser maple.. deep warmth to it. The flavor found spicy, peppery alcohol and resiny bitterness upfront, with molasses and caramel sweetness following on the syrupy middle.. hot pine and citrus bitterness around.. finished hot and heavy with big belly warmth. Heavier-bodied and too assertive for my liking on the palate, and there were too many sugars sticking around. I�d still try it again.
Delafield Imperial IPA;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Delafield Brewhaus;On tap at the Delafield Brewhaus. Pours an unclear orangey copper with an off-white head. Nice lacing. Aroma has nice floral hops up front, then pine, fresh fruit and syrupy resin come through. Much more citrusy aroma as you get further through the glass. Taste is of citrus fruit (orange/grapefruit), pine, pears and resin. Very syrupy thick and resinous down through the glass. There is caramelly sweet malt present, however it is very muted. Finishes very bitter with a citrusy overripe fruit blend. Interesting and a solid hop-forward, thick double ipa.
Delafield Imperial IPA;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Delafield Brewhaus;On tap at the Brewhaus. Deep copper color. Aroma is sweet with very floral citrus hopping. Flavor starts as fresh bitter citrus, then gives way to a mildly woody pine before finishing clean and with some decent residual pine/citrus. Malt backbone is not overly pronounced in terms of flavor, but certainly there in the palate and balance to the hops. Middle to end of hop flavor has a bit of a Pine-sol tinge to it, however. All-in-all, pretty good.
Delafield Imperial IPA;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Delafield Brewhaus;Cask conditioned at the Brewhaus. Served at 55 degrees, with 10 % ABV. Reminiscent of Dreadnaught. Huge hops, of course, with warming alcohol. Long finish (on and on). Another creative brew from this brewpub.
Delafield Imperial IPA;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Delafield Brewhaus;Handpull from cask at brewpub: Grapefruit nose from this dark orange still pint.

Reminded me of a slightly thinner Cask conditioned Dreadnaught. Big prop to Delafield for this huge brew!

Lindeboom Oud Bruin;Neer, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Lindeboom Bierbrouwerij;Fles. Mooi donker bier, bijna zwart. Zoetig, vooral het schuim. Maar wel een oud bruin met een tikje bittere afdronk. En heel aards. Daarmee beter dan veel andere soorten oud bruin. Maar tja, het blijft maar oud bruin natuurlijk.

Clear, very dark brown to black with a medium large, frothy, slowly diminishing, beige head. Sweetish-malty and a little fruity aroma of caramel, burnt sugar and traces of raisins. Quite sweet, malty, bready and a little fruity taste of caramel, toasted bread, burnt sugar, grains and hints of raisins, followed by a short, slightly bitter, bready finish. Thin to medium body, moderately effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Well-drinkable, not too sweet Oud Bruin.

Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Apricot Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;Wow, first one to rate this in almost 2 years (and the first one still under 1,000 ratings now). Pours a hazy gold with a thin white head. I see this one being favored by a lot of non hardcore beer drinkers during the summer. Mild aroma, wheat, little fruit. The apricot flavor seems to be a lot more overpowering now than in the past. I thought the sweet apricot really took over everything else in the beer. Was good though, I could see enjoying this on their rooftop if we could ever get some nice weekends.
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Apricot Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;Light hazed, golden/amber with a smallish, off-white head that was quick to fade. Mild fruitiness, grains and nuttiness in the aroma, with the apricot more subdued than expected. Thin bodied with a wet, wheat flavor and mild, sour fruitiness again in the finish. Decent enough for a fruit beer. On tap at Rock Bottom, Chicago, IL 60610
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Apricot Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;Flavored American wheats are never gonna thrill the b�jeebers out of me, but with the hot, humid weather that we�ve been having in the Chicago area, this slid down just fine. It pours a hazy, dull orange with a respectable cream colored head and has only a faint apricot aroma. Most is taken up by a soft lemony wheat smell. This tastes of wheat, light malt, apricot, spices, and lemon. A solid Summer thirst quencher. Rock Bottom Chicago, Chicago, IL
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Apricot Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at R.B. Chicago. Poured a hazy dull golden with a medium cap of creamy white head. Nose was of artificially-sweet lemony-wheat with some bready malts and bubblegum. The apricot was faint, but eventually came through. Artificially-sweetened apricot, bready malts, and tart wheat in the flavor... a hint of lemon zest at the finish. This felt unremarkable on the palate... although not bad. Tart notes were well-placed.
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Apricot Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;Hazy golden orange with a thin, tight white head. Mild, fruity apricot aroma with a bit of mild citrus, berries (?), wheat bread, yeasty dough, subtle, floral hops and a bit of orange juice. The body is just about right for an excellent thirst-quencher on a hot, muggy Chicago evening. The flavor profile is also quite nice. The apricot, while present, is but a hint and keep the beer from becoming one dimensional one hand and from becoming cloying on the other. The wheat yields a spiciness to keep things interesting. The finish is quick, but refreshes and cools one off and has just a hint of mild bitterness. All told, this isn�t the kind of thing dreams are made of, but it does it�s job effectively.
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Apricot Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Draft. Another nice summer fruit wheat beer by Pete Crowley. Pours an opaque wheat body, made a little browner by the apricot, under a thin, lacy head. Smell is of a clean lawnmower type beer. The apricot flavor is not profuse, but lends a nectar character and a seet/tart note. Seems to be a light American(?) hop bill, just to balance, although there is a more bitter taste in the finish. Its alcohol sneaks up on you a little, instead of lending ""warmth."" A little ""thick"" for a summer beer, you�ll have to sit down to enjoy it."
Shed Burton Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - English;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;An English Old Ale. Again, seeing that this beer was slammed before, my guess is that improvements have been made at the Shed. While an English Old ale isn�t my favorite style, I thought this was a decent beer (it was my wife�s favorite beer - and she�s picky and beer knowledgeable!). Deep ruby red color, sweet malt aromas. Mild and subtle english hopping (my guess is EKG).
Shed Burton Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - English;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Oh man, this smells like cheese. Hazy amber with small off-white head, this medium bodied brew has an astirgent finish and is harshly acidic throughout. As with the rest of the brews I tried on this pub vist, there was an underlying sewery and rusty quality. Lightly sweet malt diminshed quickly lending way to overly acidic finish.
Hops Love Handles;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Light citrus hop aroma. Pale, orangish gingerale colored beer. Moderately hoppy, lightly tart and sweet. Goes vacant and watery. Medium light saazy finish, starchy body.

Hops Love Handles;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);"Pale yellow body. Aroma of fresh vomit. The taste isn�t much better. My friend put it best: ""Compared to this, Michelob Ultra is Champagne!"""
Hops Love Handles;Madison, Georgia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Nearly clear body, similar to lemon water. Scummy white head. Light malt smell, nothing else. Taste is sweet apple malt, carbonated water. Very drying. Bitter, spicy ending. This is susposed to be a �low carb� concoction that was unfortunately added to my brewhouse sampler.
James Squire Brewhouse Charlottes Gift;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;Clear amber colour. Hoppy aroma. Short hop flavour with a hint of malt. Smooth fizzy palate.
James Squire Brewhouse Charlottes Gift;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;19 July 2004 - Light pleasant fruity malt but not hoppy aroma. Slightly cloudy orange colour, wonderful lacing with a low head retention. Better balance than Highwayman or Speculator, with a lingering fruit malt and hop powered flavour. Clean medium mouthfeel with lingering slightly metallic aftertaste.
James Squire Brewhouse Charlottes Gift;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;Aroma: fruity with an almost jelly crystal like sweetness. Appearance: orange with a white tiny bubbly head that left good lacing. Not perfectly clear. Flavour: sweet fruity with balanced hop flavour and bitterness. Palate: medium mouthfeel, drinks clean. Overall served WAY too cold but rather enjoyable when warmed up a bit.
James Squire Brewhouse Charlottes Gift;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;The appearance is a clear haziness. Huh? Yeah, well it has what seems to be a typical APA presence with an accompanying orange hue. The head is very temporary which even sounds like it was losing impetus even just after pouring. The aroma is a soft floral of some hop the barguys told me was �A 29�. WTF? Anyway, it is a bit like a LC or SNPA but without the real presence of the desired hop. The taste and mouthfeel is an APA style but just not exactly what I want from this beer. The name? Apparently James Squire came out on the HMS Charlotte.
James Squire Brewhouse Charlottes Gift;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;James Squire Brewhouse;Pours a murky yellow colour with poor head retention. Nice hoppy, fruity aroma - definitely an American pale ale. Very fresh. Strong, harsh hop flavour with lots of tinned fruit salad and light bitterness. Hops seem stacked at the front end - I want more bitterness. Quite nice though, and beats everything else they have on tap there at the moment.
Dockside Marina Light Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dockside Brewing Co. (BC);On tap at the restaurant. Aroma is soft lager notes, rather faint.

Dockside Johnston Pilsener;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dockside Brewing Co. (BC);On tap at Dockside, pours a clear pale yellow with a small white head. Aroma is nearly non-existent. Flavour doesn�t taste like a pilsner - weird subtle notes of skunky grass are in there somewhere. Not a whole lot of character. Not as offensive as the regular lager, but still pretty bad.

Hadrian & Border Byker Blonde;Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hadrian Border Brewery;Cask handpull at Tilley�s, Newcastle. Pale gold, lasting thin white head. Light hop aroma, lagery in mouth, a typical blonde beer. Needs more hop in my opinion. Touch of hard candy toffee flavour too.
Hadrian & Border Byker Blonde;Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hadrian Border Brewery;Cask at the Swan in the Rushes, Loughborough.

Archers Six Hop;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask conditioned at the Raven, Bath 11/5/07. Pale gold with next to no head. Aroma was a mixture of floral and resiny hops. Flavour was slightly citrussy with some grassy edge. Finish was fairly dry. A decent pint.
Archers Six Hop;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask@Dartford Beer Festival. Pale blonde, sulfury, lightly grainy, bitter-ish finish. Quite thin, but decent i suppose, a bit boring. I was hoping it would be hoppy given the name, pretty disspaointed.
Archers Six Hop;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);"Beer #5 at Dartford Beer Festival with SilkTork and Duff. Gold colour. Grassy hop aroma with a dusty edge. A whiff of sulphur too. Vaguely citric hop flavour, but, as ST says, all a bit muddled and ill-defined. It�s not clear what the six hops are but the ""kitchen sink"" approach doesn�t really come off too well in this context. Perhaps not quite ready. Cask (gravity)"
Archers Six Hop;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Dartford Fest. Gravity. At this point Duff joined Chris and me and immediately the beer quality plummets. A golden bitter with a pale malt and sulphury aroma. Flavour is restrained pale malt and an assortment of hops that never quite come together. Some citric notes, some dusty earthy notes, some pleasant floral notes - but all muddled together and working against each other. Interesting, but not quite successful.
Archers Six Hop;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Yellow gold with a white head. Aromas are floral, buttery, fruity, sweet and pine. Lots of hops. Perhaps six varieties! Flavours are initially fruity with a sour tang, then lots lots of dry, bitter hops. Some softness, too, giving a buttery smoothness on the palate - until the dry finish. The best Archers I have had.
Borve Extra Strong;Aberdeenshire, Scotland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Borve;26th November 2015 Scopey 10K Celebrations in deepest Croydonia. Thanks to the man of the event for the Scottish whale. Very hazy amber beer, good cream colour head. Palate is light and fairly dry. A residual amount of carbonation surprises. Nose of blue cheese which carries over to the taste but not as strongly. Savoury something in to mild wood. Tangy caramel, some papery oxidisation. Mild dried fruits. Dry finish brings a little spice. Rich and tasty but the blue cheese I found off putting and it really lowers drinkability.
Borve Extra Strong;Aberdeenshire, Scotland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Borve;Bottle share at Scopey�s 10K, Croydon. Many thanks to the man himself. Sell by 1997. Dark orange / brown, hazy, small foamy tan head, light lacing. Aroma is initially brie cheese, damp cardboard and copper pipe. But settles down with time. Body is medium to full, smooth, rounded, oily. Taste is dried fruit skins, papery dryness, slightly sour notes mixing with peated whisky. Quite an experience. Interesting stuff!

Medium sweet flavor with some novelty peat notes, more leather, dirt, dried fruits, citrus rind. Full bodied with fine carbonation. Lightly warming finish, somewhat dry and woody, more smoke and peat, leathery berries, some grain husk. Has held up quite well. Novel stuff.
Borve Extra Strong;Aberdeenshire, Scotland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Borve;Bottle for beer #9999. It pours clear rich deep brown with actually quite a decent off-white head.

Borve Extra Strong;Aberdeenshire, Scotland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Borve;One of the re-branded Mikhael Gorbachev bottles. Moved about endlessly for 20 years. Poured a light amber with minimal head. Aroma of a burgundy. Fullish body, flavour is sweet berry fruit and a hint of Port. Probably a bit past it�s best now, but surprisingly drinkable in small doses.
Borve Extra Strong;Aberdeenshire, Scotland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Borve;Bottle at the Deanso�s monthly RB tasting, July 2013. Poured a cloudy orange amber with a thin white broken head. The aroma is rich, fruity malt, a little dry and stale. The flavour is rich alcoholic medium bitter with a little sourness in the palate. The BBF date is 1994 and this is very obviously an old beer, but reasonably well preserved.

Bear Brew Tuff End Porter;Orono, Maine, United States;Porter;Bear Brew Pub;Pours an opaque brown with hints of ruby. Zero head and zero lacing. Smells very sweet. Sweet dark malt and milky chocolate aromas. Taste is less sweet, better balanced than the aroma. The sweetness is still there but balanced nicely with some roasty malt flavors. Bitter chocolate and undertones of coffee. Low level bitterness prevails in the finish, sweetness in the aftertaste. Nicely balanced, I feared it might be too sweet for me. Nice porter, worthy for a pint or two if you make it to Orono.
Bear Brew Tuff End Porter;Orono, Maine, United States;Porter;Bear Brew Pub;Brown opaque body with tan quickly depleting head. Tastes somewhat sweet, with a smoked component and coffee. Not bad, but not as well ballanced as it could be I felt... Still worth a try...
Bear Brew Tuff End Porter;Orono, Maine, United States;Porter;Bear Brew Pub;This is one of the better local beers i�ve had. The porter is more stout than their stout, which is a sad indicator for the stout. Regardless it has a great initial full flavor with a nice trailing aftertaste. This beer is slightly sweet, and by far the best offering to come out of the bear brew pub yet. If your ever around Orono you need to try this beer.

Holba Speci�l;Hanu�ovice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Pivovar Holba (PMS P�erov);My Bottom Line: Sweetish caramelized cereals are bothered by oppressive diacetyl, as orange-bearing hops attempt balance with their leafy bitterness. Further Personal Perceptions: -A healthy head of foam covers the shiny amber. -This is sweeter than most Czech lagers out there. -That diacetyl is beyond the threshold of what I can tolerate within this style. -This tastes like an old-world Bitter. 1,5-liter PET bottle.

West Berkshire Pipers Purse;Yattendon, Berkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;West Berkshire Brewery;Cask conditioned - handpump - NBC Club Northampton. A mid brown beer with quite a creamy head in spite of no use of sparkler in the dispense. The aroma is fruity and malty, and the taste is a good mix of bitterness and hops. A nice well balanced beer.

Harrisons Honey Blonde;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Had this one on draught at the brewpub in Orland Park, Illinois. Pours a hazy yellow with a wilmy white head, citrusy nose with strawberry, sweet clover honey. Very good session beer.
Harrisons Honey Blonde;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Very good (surprisingly) blond. Floral hopping and sweet malt and honey base. I am surprised.
Harrisons Honey Blonde;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;A lightly-hazed bright-gold with a small & foamy white head that was quickly ring. Flavor was herbal hops and a lot of honey. Quite tasty, actually. Went down nice & easy. Nutty, metallic finish. If you like honey beers, this is better than J.W. Dundee�s Honey Brown. On tap at Harrison�s Brewing Company, Orland Park, IL
Harrisons Honey Blonde;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;"I stopped in the brewpub for a quick beer on a hot summer day and forgot my rating notepad in the car. When I returned some twenty minutes later, all I could remember to jot down about it was ""not offensive."" Pale yellow with a decent white head, it had almost no aroma, just a faint scent of honey. Very mildly sweet in taste, there was little hint of malts, hops... anything. The finish was wet. Harrisons Brewing Company, Orland Park, IL"
Harrisons Honey Blonde;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Sample at the brewpub. Very pale, almost the same as the Light in color, clear. Very light sweet aroma, OK honey-apple flavors, hint of spice, but overall rather bland.
Harrisons Cherry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;golden with a slight white head. aroma of wild cherries. luckily, there is only a hint of cherry in the flavor. light bodided, not as much of a gag-inducer as i feared.
Harrisons Cherry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Had this one on draught at the brewpub in Orland Park, Illinois. Cloudy dark orange pour, served with a cherry! Sweet, almondy and nutty nose, a bit malty flavor, wheaty and sweet chocolate throughout, the marischino, however, is a bit overpowering. Smooth and sweet finish. Pretty good!
Harrisons Cherry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;I had this beer a few months ago while Christmas shopping and just now found my review. Served as an unfiltered, golden/amber brew with a skinny white head, this looks like a nice Hefe. An over-cherried aroma is both sweet & tart, a real plus if you�re really into cherries. Thick & wheaty in the mouth, a little chalky. Flavor has some cereal notes working nicely in tandem with the cherries, which are not as overpowering here as in many typical brewpub fruit beers (including some of Harrison�s others). Mildly nutty on the back end with a hint of sour milk. Not bad. On tap at Harrison�s Brewing Company, Orland Park, IL 60462
Harrisons Cherry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Not that awful, but why do I keep coming back to this place? Typical brewpub: weak, timid, boring beers aimed directly at the mainstream beer- drinking crowd, that really just wants a Miller Light anyway! They make up for it by having a four page menu full of crap that Bennigan�s does better and cheaper. The real question I have to ask is, why do I keep thinking this is going to get better?
Harrisons Cherry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;This is the first time I�ve had a beer with a maraschino cherry (intentionally) placed at the bottom of the glass. I like that kind of cherry, which is why I rated trhe beer as high as I did. Had a strong cherry smell emanating from a golden, well carbonated brew with a nice white head. Not bad tastinng, actually, with a sweet fruity finish. I ate the cherry when done. Harrisons Brewing Company, Orland Park, IL
Harrisons Cherry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Sample at the brewpub. You know you�re in trouble when a brewpub has TWO fruit beers on at the same time...here�s the first. Intense cherry-coughdrop nose, pretty light on the fruit flavor, little malt, light finishing sourness. Not bad, not good.
Alcazar Gaolers Ale;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Old Ale;Alcazar (Shipstone's);"Forgotten in the fridge, bb Apr 08, possibly 6 years old Dark chestnut/brown color with very small head, low carbonation. Some aroma of caramel and dust. Soft mouthfeel; the body is thinner than expected; there is some caramel flavor, light smoke, and already too much oxidization. Not bad, but declining."

Ambery brown colour with mediumsized slightly off-white head that leaves some lace. Aroma is caramel malts, some slight floral and grassy notes as well as mild plumlike notes. Flavour is being quite much the same as the aroma, but is a bit more bitter than the aroma would have promised.

Prairie Rock Raspberry Wheat;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Not bad. Actually it�s more like Kool-Aid than a beer, I agree with GWS57�s assertion that it�s like a PB&J Sammich. Not as nasty of a flavor as Leinie�s Berry Weis, very fruity aroma to it. Pinkish-red tinge to color, a little unnatural. Try mixed with Vanilla Creme Ale!
Prairie Rock Raspberry Wheat;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Had this one on draught in Elgin, Illinois. Very nice, sweet with strong presence of berries early on, in the nose and early in the palate, then malty and wheaty, almost like drinking a liquid peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Prairie Rock Raspberry Wheat;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Sample at the Elgin location. Translucent rose, bit of foam. Weak but fairly fresh fruity aroma...light, fruity, refreshing, bit of sourness, not cloying, ok body. Accepatable.
Prairie Rock Rockn Red Ale;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;12oz bottle (Old Notes-Brewed by Chicago Brewing Co.)-Pours a medium copper with a decent head. Aroma of malt and caramel. Taste of the same with some slight hops coming in. This light to medium bodied brew is not bad.
Prairie Rock Rockn Red Ale;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;On tap at Prairie Rock. Poured a clear blood red with absolutely zero head after about 45 seconds. Sweet, candied caramel steals the show on the nose.. not much room for anything else besides a hint of vanilla that wafted through. The flavor was just like the nose.. sweet caramel and candy with a pinch of vanilla.. mild floral bitterness is in there, but doesn�t stand up to the sweetness bomb.. some sharp boozy points peek through for no good reason. Just about medium-bodied and too sweet.
Prairie Rock Rockn Red Ale;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Not a bad red, but nothing memorable. Coppery in color, carmely in nose and flavor.
Prairie Rock Rockn Red Ale;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Had this one on draught in Elgin, Illinois. Your standard everyday red. Quite malty, caramel malts? Not much else going on here.
Prairie Rock Rockn Red Ale;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Color of Killians, a reddish/dark amber with not much of a cream-colored head. Moderately malted in aroma and flavor, but my palate was somewhat skewed after some lingering chocolate from the beer prior to this one. I will have to try again. BrewFest, Elgin, IL 06/18/05
Prairie Rock Rockn Red Ale;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Brownish copper with a modest fizzy head, this has a caramel malt aroma with an earthy, herbal hopping to it. It�s medium bodied and light on carbonation. The flavor continues quite malty with a dirty hop bitterness on the finish. Acceptable. BrewFest, Elgin, IL 06/18/2005
Prairie Rock Rockn Red Ale;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;"Sample at the Elgin location. Deep, clear copper; malty, earthy aroma...wet black soil with a few drops of vanilla spilled. Very malty, caramel flavor, with perhaps a touch of mint and oregano. Not bad at all, especially for a style I usually dismiss."
Prairie Rock Imperial Stout;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;From a growler at Goose Island Stoutfest. Poured a very deep brown with a well-retained creamy beige head. Quite sweet aroma with dark berries & other fruits, light chocolate, and anise. Roasty chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, and anise provide an excellent flavor component with nicely placed bitters. Carbonation was a tad low, possibly from the growler treatment. Finish was of mildly bitter and roasy chocolate + berries. Very fine brew!
Prairie Rock Imperial Stout;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Black with a thin off white to tan head. Nose is mostly roasted dark fruit and malts some significant coffee as well. The taste is mostly coffee with a pretty big alcohol kick to it. Overall not that bad and has a strong showing. I would have liked more hops but overall not bad at all.
Prairie Rock Imperial Stout;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;This stout is black as the day is long, topped with an oily, tan film and served in a snifter. It showed signs of stickiness on the glass when swirled. Smells rich & roasty with dark fruits, raisin, plum & molasses. Syrupy sweetness gagged me at first but as I got used to it, the sweetness clashed well with roast coffee bitters. Syrupy thick in the mouth as well. Thick & potent. Almost absurdly thick. No weakness detected as previous raters have implied, so it sounds like they�ve tweaked their recipe in the year-and-a-half since then. It took me over an hour to sip down my single 10 oz. glass, and I don�t consider myself a lightweight. On tap at Prairie Rock Brewing Company, Elgin, IL 60173
Prairie Rock Imperial Stout;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;"i took home a growler of this since i was passing by the area. prairie rock is near me. buddies and i have on a couple occasions got wasted and have had a grand old time (always at Elgin; I've only been at the Elgin location). great food at prairie rock. a riverboat casino across the street... anyway. i was surprised as muzzlehatch seems to note. ""an imperial stout?"" the waitress nodded her head and went to fill my growler with it. ""well,"" i thought, ""even though i don�t believe her i won�t be losing my earned money at the boat."" so, i gladly walked out and took it home to sample. as always, prairie rock has nothing offensive. everything at the brewery is good, but... if you�ve been spoiled like me you know that this a weak imperial stout. i like it, sure, i really do, but imperial? perhaps a dry stout is more like it. here we go with my real notes: black pour and body. thin tan fizzy head. at first i thought i was pouring a really syrupy cola that had no annoying soda bubbles, rather than that, i sat in front of a bowl glass filled with blackwater, which had no bubbles nor any head left. how is the actual f*cking beer you might say? well, of course it�s good... it�s just mediocre. first it�s sweet and sour then it�s dry and bitter; pleasantly so. the palate is lovely, lightly cremey. the flavor is what�s watery, not the palate. the flavor is good, but for an imperial there should be no note of watery. it needs more. i drank it and enjoyed it, but i�m a critical bastard am i not? overall, it�s good with mostly notes of coffee, sugar, and light fruit as muzzlehatch mentions - perhaps he influenced me a little bit. there�s also a slightly roasted note of chocolate; something slightly roasted and sweet and sour. in any case, go and try this if you can! they also had a raspberry wheat on tap, but i was too stupid to buy it; i should have bought a growler of raspberry wheat to rate as well. alright... this imperial stout is a delicious treat that warms, but i think i was misinformed... imperial? when left to warm for more than awhile the drink becomes reminiscent of old coffee albeit not disturbingly bitter, rather than that it's sweeter -- like chocolate -- with notes of only alcohol and very slight sour fruit. interesting!"
Prairie Rock Imperial Stout;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;"Sample at the Elgin location. ""An Imperial Stout""? Yes, the waitress said. In June? She didn�t understand that that was odd (at least in the midwest). I said, ""are you sure?"" She went and checked, yup, 8%, Imperial, yes yes. OK. Too bad it�s a really mediocre example. Opaque, lasting dark tan head; nose mostly sweet chocolate, bit of espresso late. Fairly thick and creamy upfront, bitterness late along with sour cherry-wine and more than a hint of alcohol. Booze flavor too much as it warms."
Carlyle Hefeweizen;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Carlyle Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub, pours a hazy light yellowish gold with a white head that sticks around for a while, the aroma was pretty weak for a hefe, a touch of banana and clove, the flavor is weak as well, the spices and banana come through but it just feels really weak and watery compared to other nice hefe�s.
Carlyle Hefeweizen;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Carlyle Brewing Company;Draft @ Carlyle. Pours a cloudy yellow with about a finger of white head. Aroma of banana, clove and wheat. Taste is about the same. Pretty good Hefe. Absolutely a great summer beer.
Carlyle Hefeweizen;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Carlyle Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Hazy orange-brown-tan. Medium off-white head. Soft carbonation, a little watery. Sweet, with some orange-banana tones. Smooth, medium bodied, not much depth. OK, rather unimpressive.
Carlyle Hefeweizen;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Carlyle Brewing Company;On tap 10/11/08. Pours a clear yellow with a solid white head. Aroma is a very nice banana and clove flavor with a bit of wheat pulling up the rear. Flavor has a heavier clover flavor with a banana undertone, great med-high carbonation which leaves great lacing on the glass. Very easy to drink.
Carlyle Hefeweizen;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Carlyle Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub on 6/20/07: Pours a hazy light bronze with a thin, spotty-lacing white head. Aroma boasts sweet bready German wheat and yeast along with mild earthy clove and citrus. Body starts with a touch of lightly sweet wheat, good fullness and a bready yeasty finish, but not as crisp and flavorful as others.
Carlyle Hefeweizen;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Carlyle Brewing Company;"Date: 06/20/2007 Mode: Draft Source: Brewpub hazy orange, fine white head, streaks of lace, sweet clove and banana aroma, lots of sweet banana flavor balanced by the clove character, one of the best balances I come across, Aroma: 6/10; Appearance: 6/10; Flavor: 7/10; Palate: 6/10; Overall: 13/20 Rating: 3.2/5.0 Drinkability: 8/10 Score: **+/4"
Carlyle Hefeweizen;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Carlyle Brewing Company;In a pint at Carlyle. Good body with scents of clove and banana. Pleasant grainy flavor.
Carlyle Hefeweizen;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Carlyle Brewing Company;Pint at the brewery. Aroma of banana and clove with a nice twang to it. Very cloudy yellow with a white head. Flavors of bubblegum, banana, malt, spice etc... A decent hefe that doesn�t taste too much like fake banana candy. Medium body with a creamy texture.
Carlyle Hefeweizen;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Carlyle Brewing Company;Cloudy kinda yellow in color with a slight head that left fairly good lacing on side of glass. Nose is mostly bannana with some fruit and grains. The taste at first was some wheat then to bannana then more to some barley. As the glass warmed the bannana became very present and almost too dominant. Very drinkable and pleasant.
Carlyle Hefeweizen;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Carlyle Brewing Company;Mostly translucent pale yellow in color with a fizzy body and thin white head. Aroma is bananas, pepper and cloves. Some lemon accents, but a fairly sweet, subdued and enjoyable whiff. Some harsh lemon acidity leads the flavoring, luckily transitioning to crisp lemons, bananas and cloves. Acidity and pepper manifest in the finish. Fair, but could be better.
Carlyle Raspberry Wheat;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Carlyle Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. This controversial love-it-or-hate-it beer is definitely not for everyone. Many were understandably put off by the exotic, highly unusual (esp. for the style) slightly peppery spice character that, as Mr. Muzzle points out, was construed by some to taste a bit like soap. I found the spice character to be rather fascinating, though I must admit I didn�t like it at first. Not overly sweet or syurpy like I would have expected. Unfortunately this beer is no longer available but the Berry Brown has a bit of the same spicy character along with the raspberry zing. Hopefully it will be revived now and then in the future. EDIT Oct 4th 2005: Berry Brown no longer available either, with only a small chance it will be offered again in the future. Furthermore, staff member informs me the raspberry wheat will almost certainly never be brewed again.
Carlyle Raspberry Wheat;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Carlyle Brewing Company;tap at brewpub-This is most likely the best fruit wheat beer i have ever had-pours a light yellow hue with some cloudyness-the brewer used whole raspberries in this one and it definately did the job! I really like the spices and the raspberry flavors in this one-lots of complexity and didn�t taste like another fruit extract brew. Nice job carlyle!
Carlyle Raspberry Wheat;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Carlyle Brewing Company;"Sample at the brewpub. Lightly hazy dark amber; simple, light fresh fruity aroma. Odd soapy characteristic immediately noticeable in flavor...fresh fruit is evident, but the initially off flavor ultimately sabotages...only real disappointment from this interesting newish brewpub."
Great Dane Dark Mild;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"Pours a light brownish color with off-white head. Caramel malts, butterscotch and grain on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with a little sweetness."
Great Dane Dark Mild;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Cask pour at the downtown location, pours a clear dark brown with a red hue in the light, the aroma was of light roast and caramel with the flavor pretty much the same thing, caramel sweetness with some bread notes in the finish, didn�t expect much out of this one and it wasn�t all that bad at all.
Great Dane Dark Mild;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Tap at downtown location. Amber brown black body. Foamy, lacy beige head. This is respectable offering from Great Dane, really true to style. Cask mouthfeel and subdued carbonation. Some faint buttery caramel chocolate tones. Not phenomenal, but a pleasant stateside offering.
Great Dane Dark Mild;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Cask at downtown location. Pours a deep brown with ruby at the edges. A dissipating off white head as well. Nose is toasty, edging on roasty, and lightly sweet. Taste has a tartness to it that comes from the dark grain used, most likely. Minimal bitterness, mildly sweet and chocolatey. Light bodied. Okay.
Great Dane Dark Mild;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On nitro charge at the downtown Madison Great Dane brewpub. Pours a semi-clear reddish dark brown colored brew with a nitro creamy dark beige head that just does not go away. Aroma of caramel and chocolate malt, floral hops, some hazelnut and a touch of dark berries. Taste is medium bodied, smooth, creamy with flavors of caramel and roasted nuts, a hint of chocolate and dry floral hops. Finish is semi-dry with a toasted caramel malt and floral hop aftertaste.
Great Dane Dark Mild;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;[Tap] Sampled back in mid-December. Pours an opaque black color with a nitro tan head. Dry roasted grains in the aroma. The taste is like a weak stout. Roasted grain, burnt caramel, light vanilla and some cocoa in there. A dry and somewhat metallic finish. Low level of carbonation, but the nitro pour gave it a smooth and creamy mouthfeel.
Great Dane Dark Mild;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Though it said this was on cask at the downtown location, it was served with a huge, creamy head. Nitro pour? Regardless, it looked beautiful, a clear dark brown with that massive tan head. Smells chocolatey with a nice hop twinge, some dark malt, and a little lactose. Taste is dry and malty, with a hazelnut flavor. Finishes with lactose sourness. Felt like velvet in the mouth--smooth and creamy. There was nothing spectacular about this beer, but I wanted to drink another.
Great Dane Dark Mild;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Sampled on cask: Poured a dark dark brown with no head. Aroma is pretty malty- chocolate and faint hops on the nose. Taste is super disapointing. Metallicy, thin and watery in the finish- it left an awful gritty taste on my mouth, definately something i won�t be having for a while.
Great Dane Dark Mild;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On cask. Beautiful dark brown with a real nice head leaving great lacing. Nice malty aromas, pumpernickel, brown sugar, some roastiness. Some decent chocolate and caramel flavors in the taste some roastiness, not too much to it, but nice. Almost no carbonation and thin bodied, but still pretty nice. A nice brew, and one I would most likely order again.
Great Dane Dark Mild;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Mild Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Dark brown/ruby hued beer - nitro-pour creamy head - a really flavorful combination of roasted malt, doughy character, and light hints of black cherry - a little diacetyl on the back makes it slightly less enjoyable, but this is quality stuff.
Casta Unica;Apodaca Nuevo Leon, Mexico;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Especialidades Cerveceras (FEMSA);Big honkin corked and caged bottle: Thanks to TAR for this gem from his cellar. I am guessing this is at least three years old, as most ratings come from 2005 and before. Also, the cork was so dried out that I tore off the top while grappling to get it open. A corkscrew through the remaing cork did the trick and the bottle was open with a smallish pfft. The beer poured a sparkling gold into the glass, with a two finger head that liked to lace. The nose was inviting, and oxidation free. Creamy notes of caramel and toffee intermingled with a vibrant range of yeasty esthers, including pear, apple and banana. The body was rich and full, with a great carmalized sugar note leading the charge. The yeast lent to the maltiness, adding a nice depth to the honey, straw, caramel and toffee base. Finished full on the back of the tongue, with only a hint of bitterness. This has really held up well in the dark recesses of Jeff�s cool basement. Thanks again buddy!
Casta Unica;Apodaca Nuevo Leon, Mexico;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Especialidades Cerveceras (FEMSA);Chicago Trip. Saturday 01:45. How long has this bottle been sitting at Sam�s? Cork pop and head seem muted. Dirty dark copper. Sweet yeasty sugary aroma. Off-fruit. Flat. Watered-down. Watery prune and raisin taste.
Casta Unica;Apodaca Nuevo Leon, Mexico;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Especialidades Cerveceras (FEMSA);Dr. Bill Tasting @ Falling Rock: Poured a hazy golden amber color with a small off-white head.

Casta Unica;Apodaca Nuevo Leon, Mexico;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Especialidades Cerveceras (FEMSA);This is the best of Mexican beer. Amber/copper/golden brown appearance with a nice head when poured. Spciy, citrus, full, and rich flavor. Very good beer - Recommend to anyone! Would drink over and over and over again!
Casta Unica;Apodaca Nuevo Leon, Mexico;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Especialidades Cerveceras (FEMSA);Cleveland Local Gathering. Thanks to Mike (Kujo9) for this beer, which was easily the best Mexican beer I�ve ever had! Copper color with a sticky white head. Decent lacing. Malty sweet aroma with notes of fruit and some chocolate malt. Malty flavors that echo the aroma. Never cloy, but full of malty sweetness. Nice hop presence that is ever so slightly spicey. finishes with a yeasty tang and an earthy, spicy hop flavor. Certainly the surprise of the evening!
Casta Unica;Apodaca Nuevo Leon, Mexico;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Especialidades Cerveceras (FEMSA);hazy deep golden brown, white head. spicy, peppery, yeasty aroma with citrus and alcohol. flavour is very spicy and dry. orangy spicy finish. thanks mitch and peggy.
Casta Unica;Apodaca Nuevo Leon, Mexico;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Especialidades Cerveceras (FEMSA);Easily the best Mexican beer I�ve enjoyed - in fact perhaps the only Mexican beer I�ve truly enjoyed: granted there haven�t been that many different varieties figured into that personal stat. Rich amber brown with obvious sweet malt and some spiciness on the nose. It�s a little nutty and fruity, but then there is a slightly tangy quick finish. Nice.
Casta Unica;Apodaca Nuevo Leon, Mexico;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Especialidades Cerveceras (FEMSA);Nice dark fruits and eart nose. Caramel and chocolate malts are distinct. Some nut on the palate Walnuts and hazelnuts with some vanilla and cream aspects. Good hint of sourness on the finish that dries out rapidly. THE best beer from mexico I have ever had.
Casta Unica;Apodaca Nuevo Leon, Mexico;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Especialidades Cerveceras (FEMSA);"POP!, goes the cork, and we�re ready to pour, but the olfactory senses are treated from the start, with a rich, pungent, yeasty, typical Belgian aroma invading the atmosphere....let�s get it in a glass... nutty brown color, crimson edges, under a huge, fizzy tan head, anxiously active, swiftly collapsing, leaving a slight ring, ultimately. Aroma is that of a brown ale, tinged with cola notes, caramel tones, just short of richness, sweet but substantial. Taste: mellow, with flavors of chocolate, dark fruits, nuts, and herbs. Light hoppiness, tasty malt. Intriquing effort from this Mexican artisanal brewery. Medium -bodied, with a soft, fruity finish. Lands lightly on the tongue with each new sip, a brew with character and integrity. completely captures the essence of a Belgian brown. Smooth, and delcious. Roast and toast are at play in the flavor, but are well-rounded out, giving an integrated cohesion, like I said before...""mellow."" Quite a nice accomplishment from Casta."
Casta Unica;Apodaca Nuevo Leon, Mexico;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Especialidades Cerveceras (FEMSA);Bottle at Fall Beerfest In Toronto 2004. Orange-brown in colour. Aroma was yeasty, oranges, spices and alcohol. Flavour was yeasty and musty, some noticable alcohol, peppery. Medium body, medium carbonation. Finishes spicy and peppery. Neat to try.
Trap Rock Export Stout;Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Trap Rock Brewery;Pours deep brown/mahogany with a big, creamy tan head.

My notes say that the brew is ""rather bland."""
Sprecher Rathskeller Razz;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sprecher Brewing Company;Not a bad attempt at a flavored hefe weizen. I had this on their brewery tour in July 2003. I agree with the others that the raspberry overshadows everything else. Definately not a winner, but not a complete loss either.
Sprecher Rathskeller Razz;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sprecher Brewing Company;Had this when they did it awhile ago, but since retired. Just getting around to rating this now. Cheap artificial raspberry aroma and taste. Same as what they use in the Generation Porter. The berry flavouring overpowers, by far, the light weiss character and leaves you with a strange tartness on the finish. Thankfully, we�ll never see this again.
Sprecher Rathskeller Razz;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sprecher Brewing Company;Pours a hazy grapefruity pink with a puffy white head. Sweet fruity raspberry aroma shadows out any remants of wheat beer. Body starts soft and lightly fruity sweet with a nice balance of weiss character underneath. A very well balanced raspberry wheat that captures the essence of the blend of raspberry and wheat beer flavor.
Moon River Black River Imperial Stout;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Moon River Brewing Company;...had it at the brewbup but don�t remember much about it. Had a dark opaque black with almost no head. Had dark roasted malts in there, but not overwhelming. It was pretty good from what I remember.
Moon River Black River Imperial Stout;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Moon River Brewing Company;Not good for an imperial stout. Full bodied, but not a whole lot going on. Sweet, alcoholic taste and aroma. Dark fruit flavor. Not especially creamy. Needed some other flavors, too bland for an imperial stout.
Moon River Black River Imperial Stout;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Moon River Brewing Company;On tap at Moon River Brewing. Arrived at the table black with no head except for a very thin ring that left a few spots of lace. Pleasant aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, and licorice. The flavor is roasted malt, chocolate, and a bit of coffee. Similar to the porter with a fuller, more dense mouthfeel. Some alcohol reminiscent of chocolate liquer emerges at the finish as the bere warms.
Moon River Black River Imperial Stout;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Moon River Brewing Company;tap. This is an inky black stout with a suspiciously even tan head. It almost looks like the work of nitrogen except for the tell tale bubbles slowly rising from the murky depths. The aroma is tremendously nutty with espresso and vanilla wafers. Carbonation is very low and the viscous body has a very slick and creamy mouthfeel. A well balanced delivery of espresso, brownies, walnuts, and baking chocolate are in the flavor. I enjoyed this a great deal.
Moon River Black River Imperial Stout;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Moon River Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Pitch black pour. Large dark brown head. Aroma of coffee and chocolate. Thin coffee flavor with a long, bitter, smoky finish. For some reason, this beer just didn�t do it for me. It wasn�t bad by any stretch of the imagination, but wasn�t memorable either.
Moon River Black River Imperial Stout;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Moon River Brewing Company;Brown-black body with small brown head. Aroma is medium sweet, coffee, light chocolate. Taste is medium sweet, coffee, coffee liqueur, cocoa. Smooth medium body, low carbonation. The alcohol is noticeable but not overpowering. Seems very similar to the Captain�s porter, just a little stronger.
Moon River Black River Imperial Stout;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Moon River Brewing Company;From two different night at the brewpub, first poured in a pint glass, second from a wine goblet. Pours a dense black with a thick huge creamy head. At first the aroma is very harsh and acidic, but settles down after a bit and has lots of chocolate malt and roasted grains. Thick body that has lots of chocolate malt and roasted grains in the taste, also. Finishes up with a bitter hoppy creamy aftertaste. This is not the greatest Impy I have had, but a creative departure from some of the rather bland beer I find this brewery makes.
Moon River Black River Imperial Stout;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Moon River Brewing Company;This pours pitch black and has a nice, dense, lasting tan foam head. The aroma is rich, chocolate, overripe fruit, a bit of char. There�s also a slightly winey character (almost port) in there as well. The beer is complex in flavor, but something is keeping it from being a top-tier imperial stout, although I�m not sure if it�s a lack of something or just that what it has doesn�t go together all that well. Still, far from being a bad beer. Moon River does pretty well with it�s higher gravity beers.
Moon River Black River Imperial Stout;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Moon River Brewing Company;This was a very dark and rich stout. Oatmeal arouma with creamy brown head. sweet with a bitter finish. Very strong and a good finish.
Moon River Black River Imperial Stout;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Moon River Brewing Company;"Draft, red wine goblet. Chocolate, coffee, caramel, oats (M); perfume hops (L); anise, raisin, port, dates, light alcohol. Smells like a very big oatmeal stout. Deep black body with a small, creamy brown head. Heavily sweet, lightly acidic flavor becomes a heavily sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter finish. Nice piney hoppiness. Full body, creamy texture, soft carbonation, smooth vodka like warmth. The bottom line is: the aroma is not as big as I was expecting, but the flavor is pleasant with a nice piney aftertaste. Mouthfeel is extraordinary."
Moon River Scottish Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Moon River Brewing Company;Pours a dark, cloudy brown with virtually no head (what little there is happens to be tan in color) - no lace on the glass. This batch must be very different from the other two ratings because the beer I tasted doesn�t sound like the other ratings. The waitress said it was aged in whiskey barrels for over a year. And it tastes it. The aroma has some sweet malts and lots of Bourbon whiskey. The flavor follows the nose. There is lots of not-so-subtle whiskey flavor here. There are some malts and a hint of smoke, too. The mouthfeel is low on carbonation, kind of heavy and a bit oily. The overall impression is of a Jack-and-Coke. Overall not bad - if you like whiskey. But I would have preferred something with greater resemblance to beer.
Moon River Scottish Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Moon River Brewing Company;(On tap) Beautiful, clear amber with an off-white head. Malty, sweetish nose. Medium body with soft, malty accents and loads of caramel, some oak and an edge of sherry. All good stuff. Lightly sweet but immensely delicate. Very discreet bitterness. 010406
Moon River Scottish Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Moon River Brewing Company;Brewed in honor of the new ABV law passing in Georgia. Dark orange pour, little to no head - what is there is light beige in color. Has a spearmint like aroma on top of the molasses like sweetness. Flavor has elements of dates, raisins and molasses. Reminiscent of some dopplebocks I have had. Alcohol is evident, but not overdone. Very well done. Creamy thick mouthfeel.

Anglo Dutch Yorkshire Relish;Liversedge, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Partners Brewery;Cask @ Akkurat, Stockholm Light amber, white shy head.

Carolina 9th Anniversary;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;Tripel;Carolina Brewing Company;I don�t think this was a very good style in a state that�s still restricted to 6% or less. That said, I have 2 reviews. My first taste was of a clear, copper/gold beer that wasn�t sweet enough and had very little Belgian spiciness. The hops were tasty but too pronounced for the style. Then someone shook the keg to see how much was left and roused the yeast which had settled to the bottom. What a difference! Sure it was cloudy but now it was spicy and much closer to style. I wish I�d tasted THIS beer first.
Carolina 9th Anniversary;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;Tripel;Carolina Brewing Company;Very good beer for an aniversary. Got a six pack at a brewery tour. Golden and hazy in apperacne with a slight bitter aftertaste with a fruity aroma. Good beer i enjoyed
Carolina 9th Anniversary;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;Tripel;Carolina Brewing Company;Draught. Small thin head--better head later when not served in a frosted mug! Maltynose, spice and yeast noted. Copper colored, very slight haze. Flavor is malty, but not all that well mixed. Spice is prevalent in flavor. Finish is slightly astringent and there is bitterness in the middle. A strange one to pick considering the 6% NC abv law.
Phoenix Tennis Elbow;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Cask at The Green Dragon, Leek (JDW) A clear golden colour with a frothy white head. Aroma of orange, lemon, melon, some grapefruit, slight biscuity malts and spicy, floral hops. Taste of orange, lemon, some grapefruit, some melon, slight biscuity malts and subtle grassy, floral hops. Light bodied and soft carbonation.

Phoenix Tennis Elbow;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Cask, Head of Steam, Liverpool. Had to try this as a prelude to watching one of the greatest men�s finals in wimbledon history...just a pity my money was on Federer ! This was a pale golden affair with a thin white head. Drunk in haste, but very refreshing notes of citrus and hop. Would seek out again.
Phoenix Tennis Elbow;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Another nice Golden from Phoenix, with refreshing fruitiness and crisp hop tang. Lacks the true hop bit of some of their best efforts, and relaxes into a little slushiness midway, but still tasty.

Archers Summers Coming;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Conditioned, at The Pakenham Arms, Bloomsbury, London. I�d stopped at this pub twice and never committed to a beer. Then when Imdownthepub gave it a mention I thought I better reconsider my very rushed opinion of he place. Well 6 days later and the same archers is still on. I�ll say no more shall I. Amber body. Bitter, asparagus aroma. Malty base with tired hop remnants. Only 4 of the 8 hand pumps were on.
Archers Summers Coming;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Conditioned at The Pakenham Arms, Bloomsbury, London. Pale straw with thin head.

Boecht van den Afgrond (Until 2008);Sint-Truiden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Kerkom;Bottle, bought @ Delirium, Brussels.

Boecht van den Afgrond (Until 2008);Sint-Truiden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Kerkom;Bottle, shared by fonefan. It pours an almost clear, golden body with a white head. Citrusy, piney aroma. Piney in a way that made me wonder if it was caused by something else than hops. It�s also quite fruit, and has some maltyness. It�s more balanced in the flavor, sweet and malty and fruity. Some fruity syrup as well, the kind of syrup you find in canned fruit cans. Sticky-sweet in the mouth, with a fruity finish and some white sugar. A quite beer, but it�s the kind of beer there�s thirteen of in a dozen. (080412)

Red Star Dunkel Weizen;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Red Star Agave Grille;Also known as AP-1. Draught: This one poured a cloudy, coppery color. There was minimal head on it. The aroma had some wheat to it. Also notes of chocolate and light fruitiness. The taste was fairly complex, with hints of chocolate, roastiness and some fruits. The body was medium. This was quite drinkable.
Red Star Dunkel Weizen;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Red Star Agave Grille;Probably one of my least favorite of their offerings. +++Draft only. I had been looking forward to this one for a while as I am a big fan of wheats in general. It poured a moderately haze dark brown color that was moderately hazy with no significant head. The aroma was vaguely sour. The flavor was bitter and sour with a mild wheat presence. Very bitter on the finish.
Saint-Donat Ambr�e;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;The amber coloured Saint-Donat, from a brewery which existed only from 2002 to 2005, but with intentions to restart (which I am not sure has happened yet at this moment). Thick, rocky, yellowish white, dense and very stable head, colour brownish amber, near copper, cloudy. Aroma shows oxidation but some complexity too, walnuts, sherry, passion fruit, mango, whisky, ginger, tomato, peat, dried leaves, cardboard. Sweetish onset with dried fruits and caramelly malts, very nutty maltiness in the middle but cardboard as well and some maderisation not unlike soy sauce, sourishly oxidized malts, some peppery hops in the finish, medium long. Complex alright, but not well balanced and clearly suffering from old age. Difficult one to rate...
Saint-Donat Ambr�e;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;Intensiver fruchtig-alkoholischer Geruch. Prickelnder s��licher Malzantrunk, in dem der Alkohol erkennbar, aber nicht st�rend auftritt. Im Mittelteil wird das Bier herber, das Bier insgesamt flacht ab. Da es sehr prickelt, ist es nicht unbedingt einfach, die Aromen alle zu erkennen. Im Nachgeschmack ist dann eine kurze fruchtig-w�rzige Steigerung zu erkennen, die dann schnell versiegt. Test vom 18.3.2007, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 5,7,6,8,7,6 - 6,40
Saint-Donat Ambr�e;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;Bottled. A hazy reddish-golden beer with a light tan head.

Saint-Donat Ambr�e;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;(Bottled, 7,5% ABV, aged sample from BeerMania, thanks TBone!) Very hazy brown-amber with a small, but firm and very lasting, lacy head. Aroma has sweetish, dried fruit, some oud bruin -like tartness, and port-wineous hints. Sourish-malty flavor with dried fruit, lots of anise, burned sugar (still pretty dry overall). Medium body with medium carbonation. The age certainly shows, but I wouldn�t say this is past its prime. At least the flavor was quite pleasant with some similarity to De Dolle and Regenboog brews. Beautiful lacing, too.
Saint-Donat Ambr�e;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;Bottled (from Beermania, old vintage), alc. 7 % Hazy amber-brown color, small white head. Yeast, dark, overriped fruits in not so pleasant nose (propably aged yeast is doing it). Liquerish palate. Acidic, citrusy fruits, licorice, anise.

Saint-Donat Ambr�e;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;Bottled. Hazy nutbrown/orange colour, small white head. Aroma is fruityness, some yeast and spices.

Saint-Donat Ambr�e;Mettet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Donat;Bottle. Amber coloured with a massive white head. Very yeasty with some fruit in the aroma. Flavour was infected with an unpleasant Marmite yeast edge and sour fruit. Awful.

Bethlehem Brew Works Irish Red;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Fegley's Brew Works;The nitro doesn�t really do it for me. I like the slight caramel malty tones and its an easy drinker but it doesn�t seem full enough to be an ale. Too thin for my likes. The overseas nitro beers seem fuller as this one lacked carbonation.

Weltons Golden Balls;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Weltons Beer;Cask, Hoopers, East Dulwich. A murky bronze colour, thin off white head. Aroma is cheesy socks mixed with stagnant pond. Not exactly a winning combination. Flavour is some herb and hop somewhere. Watery. The �posh lips� reference on the clip is low class.

Kuhnhenn Breakfast Sausage Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Kuhnhenn Brewing;"2004 bottle. A mix between a smoked and a herb beer, but the sage is significantly more dominant than the smoke. It pours a rusty, goldenrod yellow, hazy and full of sediment; quite bottle conditioned. Good white head as well and plenty of darker brown colors swirling around. Aroma is full of sage, light grease and smoke that would come off of a skillet that was grilling perhaps some turkey sausage and some herbed eggs. Flavor is malty right away, caramel, honey and some dough but then the sage comes out and mixes with the light smoke creating the breakfast sausage (definitely eggs too) effect. Incredibly cool that they brewed this beer for that effect and achieved it. Tastes great, plenty of malt, spice and smoke to go around and not linger too much on any one aspect. It has a bit of astringency from the large amount of sage, on the finish, but it�s to be expected. I suppose you really have to like sage and sausage and eggs to get in to this one, but I love them all and this beer is magnificent."

The aroma offers up roasted malts, dry cracker, biscuit malts and some vague sort of hoppy notes.

Around the edges of these notes are wafer thin rings of sweet dark fruity esters and some caramel malts.

Kuhnhenn Alt;Warren, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kuhnhenn Brewing;GTMW 08 - This was a wonderful alt. Pours bronze with a tan head.

Kuhnhenn Alt;Warren, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Thanks to hopdog for this... Appears a light, hazy amber with a small white head and little bits of scattered lacing around the glass. Smell is of light sour apples and hops with light amounts of caramel malt coming through. Taste is of the same aromas Mouthfeel is slightly sour with some nutty malt trying to balance it out. Not a typical alt, IMO but not a bad beer.
Delafield Train Wreck of Flavor;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Delafield Brewhaus;Draft. Poured rich amber with a nice toasted beige head. The aroma picked up lots of sweet bourbon and vanilla with darker fruits, molasses, and nutty notes deeper down.. came across sweet and decadent. The flavor found lots of rich malts at the core (molasses and caramel), joined by plentyof sweet bourbon and rich vanilla.. tangy bourbon and oak on the edges.. nice dry, belly-warming finish. Heavy-bodied and sweet on the palate.. still finished dry.. good, decadent stuff.
Delafield Train Wreck of Flavor;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Delafield Brewhaus;"Rated 7/2/04. I wasn�t sure if this qualified as a ""black and tan"", so I forgot to enter my rating (actually, it isn't, since it comes out of the keg like this). Dirty amber color, fizzy bubbles around the edge. Whiskey aroma. Flavor is dominated by sweet whiskey and maybe some vanilla and licorice. A little watery and lighter than I�d have thought. Could be more complexity to..."
Delafield Train Wreck of Flavor;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Delafield Brewhaus;"12-oz snifter. Completely opaque muddy brown, quite still...think Kalua and creme, perhaps. Massive raisin-molasses initial aroma, with heady whisky-vanilla notes following, hint of hoppiness and much alcohol late. Amazing mellow in the flavor department, alcohol really not noticeable until quite warm, and still not all that obvious. Vanilla, peat, cherries, and a bit orangy; bit too thin at the end for the alcohol burst that finally makes its presence known. Certainly worth a try, but doesn�t add up to what you�d hope it might."

Wolf Will Kemps Ale;Besthorpe, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wolf Brewery;"Beer #16 at Dartford Beer Festival with SilkTork and Duff. Will Kemp was a Shakespearian actor and fool who danced his way from Norwich to London in 1599 for a bet and wrote a book about it called the ""Nine Daies Wonder"" (OK, so I always Google anyone who has a beer named after them that I�ve not heard of). It seems that a number of morris dancing troupes have sought to re-enact the event at regular intervals since. Anyway, the beer is a bright copper colour, with some biscuity malt in the aroma and a well balanced malt and hop flavour. Finishes dry, but mellow. Nice! Cask (gravity dispense)."

Comments: This is a typical macro cider with sweet juicy aroma and taste, but at least it has some decent yoghurt tartness to boost. A bit more than just an alcopop, but not much."

Freist�dter Rauchbier;Freistadt, Austria;Smoked - Rauchbier;Braucommune Freistadt;Dezenter, aber deutlich erkennbarer Rauchantrunk. Der untert�nige Malzton r�ckt zunehmend in den Vordergrund w�hrend die Rauchnote schon im Mittelteil an Intensit�t verliert. Hier setzt eine eher w�ssrige Herbe ein, die die Illusion eines verl�ngerten Raucharomas erwirkt. Dann wird die Herbe doch st�rker, die Rauchigkeit zieht sich samt W�rzigkeit zur�ck. Vielleicht etwas zu mild. Danke an den Doppelbock f�r diesen �sterreicher. Test vom 10.12.2007, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 7,10,9,7,10,9 - 8,70
Freist�dter Rauchbier;Freistadt, Austria;Smoked - Rauchbier;Braucommune Freistadt;Bottle in Freistadt, before it was retired. A mildly smoked lager, rather pale in color and much more lightly smoked than anything from Bamberg. But still the smoked complexity was there. But it had a nice malt and light smoke aroma, nice malt flavor, and good balance. The Braumeister mentioned that if he were to make it even half as smoked as a Spezial, the people here wouldn�t drink it. Interesting, but a bit unsatisfying for a rauchbier lover.
Freist�dter Rauchbier;Freistadt, Austria;Smoked - Rauchbier;Braucommune Freistadt;"(bottle) Hazy, golden to amber colour with a thick light-beige foamy head. Sweet malty and moderately smoked (ham) aroma with delicate notes of grain, vanilla and herbal hops. Sweet and slightly bitter flavour, medium bodied with a soft carbonation. Malt-accented taste with a distinctive smoke character, accompanied by cara-malt and grainy notes; slightly bitter and lasting smoke malty finish. Quaffable Rauchbier (11.XI.08)."

Freist�dter Rauchbier;Freistadt, Austria;Smoked - Rauchbier;Braucommune Freistadt;07/04 0.5 l bottle courtesy of ogivlado, thanks for sharing! This one poured a murky copper-amber body with medium sized ebony head. Very weak malty aroma. Flavor was pretty odd now, had some ham, sausages and other smoked meat, but not too intensive, quite mild all in all. Wood and caramel also evident. Thinner bodied. Some grassy hops show up finally in its aftertaste. I had two atypical smoked before, so this was quite strange for me. It didn�t impress me, but was just fine.

Brouwertje;De Meern, Utrecht, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Leckere;I had the witbier from the de Leckere a few hours before this one and they look much like each other. As if they put wrong labels on their beer... Might also be due to using the same yeast. This one is a bit more sour. Aroma of citron, grain and spices. Cloudy, yellow coloured with no head. Taste is spicy, wheat, some honey, slighly sour, some citron. Fresh brew.

Kapsreiter Stadtbr�u;Sch�rding, Austria;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Kapsreiter;500ml stoppered bottle at one of the eco-bars in Passau. Not sure what to make of this one so Landbier / Zwicklbier / Kellerbier sounds about right. Darkish, tangy, earthy but not �off�. The bar owners listed it under �Organic�. I would have it again.

Nashoba Valley Wattaquadoc Wheat;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;"On tap at winery. Pours an amber-ish gold with a small off-white head. Aroma is skunk, wheat, and grass. Taste is sweet; vaguely tart orange, light clove, vague banana bread, and chamomile. Light-medium body. Medium carbonation. Crisp-ish mouthfeel. This misses the mark on 'hefeweizen' almost entirely. The chamomile is the one interesting - and pleasant - element of this beer. Awful aroma."
Nashoba Valley Wattaquadoc Wheat;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;Straw yellow color with an aroma of spice and apple. Lots of green apple flavor with some spice. Nice beer. Different taste.

Solventy.
Nashoba Valley Wattaquadoc Wheat;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;Bottle. Poura a hazy yellow gold with a soft white cap on top.

Nashoba Valley Wattaquadoc Wheat;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;This offering from Nashoba pours a maize yellow that leaves a cloudy body with a thin white lace. The aroma is wheat, banana, honey, citrus (orange/lemon), some earthy spices from the hops throughout. The taste starts malty, banana is really present, cloves, and leaves a wheat twang and a sharp bitterness that is just crisp and refreshing particularly on a summer day. This brew is really balanced with that malty banana caramel sweetness, the spicy hops and that tart wheat twang all come together so nicely. This is a great example of a Bavarian wheat beer.
Nashoba Valley Wattaquadoc Wheat;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;on tap-pours a creamy white head that laces with cloudy straw color. Aroma is banana, clove, apple, perfumy. Taste follows, wheat.

Starts with a citrusy, sour lemon flavor, stronger than most wheats and yeast is not noticeable like it usually is in a wheat.

Nashoba Valley Wattaquadoc Wheat;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;2004 bottle. Pours a medium yellow, slight golden haze to it, with a good deal of sediment in the bottom. Foamy and slightly fizzy white head. Aroma of straw, light graininess, some bubblegum and sweet malt. Flavor starts out with a good malt base that is not to sweet but adds a good body to it, though the carbonation is strangely aggressive for an unfiltered beer. But it has a good balance between light malts and some bubblegum and light bitterness on the end. Medium body, lots of carbonation, but dosent really get watery. Moderate amount of yeast apparency through the body, but there are certainly better german hefeweizens out there. Though I will say, I was hopin for greatness out of the brewery. It�s not a failure, but here�s hopin the next beer from here is significantly better.

75th Street Spit Fire Chile Wheat;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;75th Street Brewery;MADE with HATCH CHILI PEPPERS. I thought this beer was called Dirty Miguel�s Chili beer. I did not find one of that name, there is this one though. Tap @ 75th Street. Based on the Cow Town Wheat. Light haze , yellow color. Aroma of sliced green peppers. Flavor has a nice malt under a light tingle of chilis. Light bodied. Finishes with a dominate chili pepper character. Lots of fun. I enjoyed it.
75th Street Spit Fire Chile Wheat;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;75th Street Brewery;I suspect 75th Street makes its chile beer from the base of the Cow Town--it certainly lead to confusion, as the waitress put down my sample of what she called the Dirty Maguels Chile Beer on the sampler�s place for the Royal Raspberry Wheat, also made from the same base--so ouch! I felt when I was expecting a sip of something a bit more fruity.... No aroma to speak of, except a bit of dust. No up-front flavor, just a hint of green chile, with a slow burn at the end. This is much more milder than most other chile beers I�ve had, and that�s a relief, but on the whole I still hate chile beer. It burns the lips and kills the palate. (on tap at Lawrence, KS location)
75th Street Spit Fire Chile Wheat;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;75th Street Brewery;Blah. No real flavor, yet burns your throat once you swallow it. According to the waitress, more people send it back than drink it, including the sample. I don�t know who actually likes chile beers, but this one is better than most since it didn�t make me want to vomit.

Rock Bottom Milwaukee Liquid Sun;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;Decent, right until the moment after you swallow it. Nice appearance, a hazy pour with aroma of orange and spices. I like the mouth feel and lemony taste, but there�s an aftertaste that a place like RB should�ve rid itself of long ago. And that makes it only average.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Liquid Sun;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;On tap at RB Milwaukee. Poured clear, bright golden with not much head stickin� around. Aroma picked up sweet, dry bready notes with a hint of lemon.. elegant and simple with herbal notes emerging with time. Flavor was of sweet bready and pils malts with some herbal and lemon bitter accents.. left sweeter lemon at the finish with some breadiness. Crisp for the most part on the palate, but became tacky and a touch cloying at the back end/finish. Decent summery beer. Earlier Rating: 3/5/2007 Total Score: 2.7 On tap at R.B. - Milwaukee. Poured a clear bright golden with a light dusting of white head. Aroma was light and crisp with bready, floral, and vegetal notes.. OK. Flavor picked up a light bready base with weak floral bitterness.. touches of honey and citrus.. not bad at all. Crisp and a bit too light on the palate.. quite refreshing.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Liquid Sun;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;(Milwaukee) Straw color with a wispy white head. Very light in all qualities. Slightly fruity which is a change of pace for a light. Really no faults, but why have this, when there are better choices on tap.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee German Pils;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;(Milwaukee) Golden color with a white frothy head. Aroma of spicy royal hops. Heavy bodied for this style, but not a major fault. Flavors are distinctively hoppy with a decent undertone of malt to offset the bitterness. Would be a decent session.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee German Pils;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;light in color almost no head but the little bit there looked kind of like sop bubles... extremly light almost unidentifyiable scent... the pallate was a bit thin and had very little carbonation.. it had a slightly sweet flavor w/ hints of fruitiness.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee German Pils;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;"Clear golden body, creamy white head. White bread aroma, maple-leaf hops. Sweet biscuit flavor along with dry grapey hops. An inoffensive yet boring pilsener. I stuck with the IPA. Update: I had the ""Riverwalk Pilsener"" and felt this was too close to enter it as a new beer. (I haven�t asked them if it�s the same stuff however) The stuff I had was tending towards non-floral green pepper-spicy saaz hops with a cracker malt background. Suprisingly flavorful for a beer that seems to be marketed towards the ""lite"" crowd."

Tinkoff S Dymkom (Rauchbier);St. Petersburg, Russia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Tinkoff;"Bottled, St. Petersburg. Went to the brewpub, found it not to my liking, but came away with a six of this (at 3 times the price of most beer in Russia). Having a smoked beer on a lager base was different, so this was probably the most experiemental beer I could find there. The smoke is in fact pretty light and fits in with the beer instead of giving it the ""great taste of bacon."" I�m still not too impressed by Tinkoff�s output, but this would be the one to go for if you have a choice."
Tinkoff S Dymkom (Rauchbier);St. Petersburg, Russia;Smoked - Rauchbier;Tinkoff;Lean smokey flavours taste great, but the body is thin and has trouble holding them up. Grainy notes underneath. Wet. Metallic finish. Needs more gravity - 11P and no dark malts isn�t enough.

Tinkoff Beloe (Weissbier);St. Petersburg, Russia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Tinkoff;Draft @ brewpub in St. Petersburg. Cloudy yellow with small tight white head.

Kelham Island Mysterian Hop;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Kelham Island Brewery;Beer #18 at Dartford Beer Festival with SilkTork and Duff. Pretty poor stuff. I�ll go along with ST and put it down to the condition of the beer as I can�t imagine it was meant to taste like this and the brewery has a pretty good reputation. The aroma was full of undeveloped malt and some diacetyl butterscotch. The flavours were not clearly drawn and the finish was acidic, with a noticeable afterburn. My marking is somewhat adjusted to compensate for doubts about the condition. Cask (gravity dispense).
Kelham Island Mysterian Hop;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Kelham Island Brewery;Dartford Fest. Gravity. Rough beer. Not a lot happening. Mostly flavourless and watery. Yugh! Muddled and nasty. I�ll give the benefit of the doubt and assume the problem is poor condition rather than poor beer.
Thereser M�rzen;Untertheres, Bavaria, Germany;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Thereser;A Greek man was serving up at the brewery tap. Has he taken over the brewery? There�s also a Greek restaurant. Luckily, there�s still beer brewed. A vague sweetish peach aroma, not promising much floowed by exactly the same in the flavor. Just a bit of bitterness and a rather sticky aftertaste. Yes, it�s drinkable, but not much more.
Thereser Dunkel;Untertheres, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Brauerei Thereser;Bottled. A very dark brown beer with only a faint red shine underneath a beutiful brown head. The aroma is sweet malty with primary notes of caramel, but also with light notes of dusty hops. The flavor is sweet and very malty, but soon a dryness sets in from very little residual sugar, the hops makes the end slighlty bitter, but the carbonation makes it quite sparkling. Supposedly brewed in Schweinfurt under licens of Lamm-Br�u in Untertheres.
Thereser Dunkel;Untertheres, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Brauerei Thereser;(Bottle 50 cl) Pours a beautiful, dark mahogany with a tint of red. Neat, off-white head.

Brauerei Weber Hell;Hirschaid-R�bersdorf, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Weber;Bottle purchased and consumed at the brewery in Nov. 2013: Polished blonde. Broken but consistent white foam. Mellow but appealing aromas of candyish yeast, cottony malt, lemon and flowers. Soft and snug carbonation. Softly hoppy with flower petals accentuated by a lemony elegance. Nice and dry, yet the malt exhibits great depth with a hay dust and baguette lushness to augment the notable leanness and combat the looming raspiness. Dab of pistachio-tinged yeast firms up the body and reminds you that this is Franconian to the core. Seamless finish displays soft malt and ongoing flower petals swirled with a splash of hoppy juiciness and woody Spalt. Clean and balanced, if a bit straightforward, and has just enough character to hold your interest throughout the glass.

"Jopen Stripbier 2004; Chocolade Wit";Haarlem, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Jopen;Bizarre take on the witbier theme, supposed to taste like white chocolate and originally called Barbara Stok Stripbier. Very strong gushing which leads to an almost uncontrollably rocky head - and, expectedly, a very strong carbonation in the mouth. Cloudy straw blonde colour. Aroma extremely unusual, in fact one of the most unusual I ever encountered, perfumed, citrussy, indeed chocolatey, sour cream, wheat sourness... More of the same in the mouth - if you can get past the exagerrated carbonation - with wheat base, orange peel, yoghurt, chocolate. Though I am open to bizarre �out of the box� beers like this, I cannot help feeling this could have done a lot better and more balanced - but it�s hard to set any standard against something like this.
"Jopen Stripbier 2004; Chocolade Wit";Haarlem, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Jopen;Bottle at �t Arendsnest. This was their last bottle of the famed Chocolate bier. Drank it with my pal Pieter who had enjoyed it a few years ago. It had very fruity, citrus taste, like soda pop, almost. Tarty. Slight hints of (white) chocolate, much less than I had expected. Not sure then why brown chocolate bar on the label.
"Jopen Stripbier 2004; Chocolade Wit";Haarlem, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Jopen;Hazy yellow coloured, big head.

"Jopen Stripbier 2004; Chocolade Wit";Haarlem, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Jopen;A light yellow beer with a huge white head.

Lacks complexity.
"Jopen Stripbier 2004; Chocolade Wit";Haarlem, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Jopen;Explosive gushing to very pale yellow beer with faint haze, and towering masses of snow-white head. Perfumed-spicey nose with coriander, patchouli, citrus, citruspeel, laosroot, nutmeg - and white chocolate, though that is probably suggestion. Weird perfumed-tart taste, very dry, a tad lactic, again (dry) citrus and unidentifyable spices. Some hints of sweetness, no bitterness. Very carbonised and dry at the same time. Beer has virtually no aftertaste, flavours simply vanish. Remarkable. Compared to the Floris Chocolate from their Huyghe buddies, this is heaven.

In comparison with Girardin, Cantillon, or Lindemans lambics, I found this one to be a bit unrefined - but I�m a lambic lover, so glad I tasted this anyway."
Timmermans Jonge Lambiek;Itterbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Unblended Jonge / Oude;Timmermans (John Martin);(Backlog) at spontaneous fermentation. (3 months) very hazy light golden pour, still. Aroma similar to a witte. Tart, lactic, fruit and leather flavors.
Nethergate Golden Balls;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Nethergate Brewery;Cask@The Oakdale Arms, Harringdom, N. London. Toffee apple and earthy hops are its main attributes, salty, medium bitter finish, didn�t mind it at all.
Blue Corn Cherry Wheat;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Corn Brewery (Santa Fe);Clear orangey amber appearance. Pretty restrained on the nose. Slightly grainy biscuity tones, cherry flavor is strong, Balances out with a touch of dryness in the finish.
Blue Corn Cherry Wheat;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Corn Brewery (Santa Fe);tap at santa fe location (suburbs)-pours a carmel red hue with nice lacing! aroma of ripe cherries and some wheat esters, but mostly the sweet cherry aroma. the cherry flavor is not overly done here, but it just tastes like cherry extract. Some Faint hops on the finish but a poor palate hinders their sucess. This is better than the sam adams version, but not by much.
Blue Corn Bock;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Blue Corn Brewery (Santa Fe);Reddish brown appearance. Clean malt aroma. Good malty flavor, rich and fruity, slight toastiness, creamy in the finish.
Blue Corn Bock;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Blue Corn Brewery (Santa Fe);tap at santa fe location (suburbs)-pours a dark amber hue with ninimal head and light carbonation. malts are sweet with subtle smokey notes. flavors are very sweet malts with a little alcoholic bite in the finish. some noble and earthy hops detected. This is ok, but not great. definately better than an Amber Bock!
Blue Corn St. Wenceslas Pilsener;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Blue Corn Brewery (Santa Fe);Clear golden-yellow body and a white head. Mild corn, pale malt, and wheaty notes in the aroma. Very faint hops. Flavor is very light with a stale hoppy quality. Little malt character and very thin body. This is a mild beer with not much character. Has macro pale lager qualities. Brewed for the macro-drinkers who stop by the brewpub, I suppose. Strictly a palate cleanser.
Blue Corn St. Wenceslas Pilsener;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Blue Corn Brewery (Santa Fe);tap at santa fe location (downtown)-pours pale yellow with white head-medium carbonation. A microbrewery putting out a low carb beer? what is this crap? This had a little more flavor than most, but still sucked! Blue corn, what is wrong? your albuquerque location puts out awesome seasonals, but this is terrible! WTF?
Tring Becks Bender;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tring Brewery;This is a test to see if the rate beer system is working on my phone. It seems to be cutting off reviews. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Tring Becks Bender;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tring Brewery;Cask@The Oakdale Arms, Harringdom, N.London. Obvious David Beckham referance here. This was still on tap, a week after the English were out of the Euro 2004 Championships, maybe no one was buying it coz becks had an ordinary tournament? It tasted great though. Melony, lychee flavours, quite aromatic and hoppy. Some subtle toffee apple. Nice dry, bitter, dry salty finish, quite light, but covers the palate nicely, nice summer drinking, fruity and dry.
Blue Corn Irish Red;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Blue Corn Brewery (Santa Fe);tap at santa fe location (downtown)-pours on nitro with a cool cascading action from the tap. dark copper hue with nice off white nitro poor head. Sweet toasty malt aroma-pretty earthy for the most part. Flavors match the aroma. velvety feeling on the palate, but somewhat low carbonation. the lacing on this one was amazing! not much finish, but most irish ales dont really have much there. pretty good.
Arriba Light;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);This had a very light head.light straw color.light bodied.aroma of grass.Tasted like Coors.It is the South American version of Coors.Not bad,but not worth paying the higher import fee.Just buy Coors.
Arriba Light;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Another fizzy, banana-yellow piss lager. Almost zero flavor or aroma. To dignify this beer with further description would be an insult to myself. Overall, poor+.
Arriba Light;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Let,s try this again. Pale yellow color. Bland taste of the palate. Can�t and will not finish.
Arriba Light;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Pours an ugly pale straw color with a sickly slimy white head that immediately dies down. Aroma isn�t skunky despite the clear bottle, but it�s still really gross. Smells like rotting corn, DMS, and plastic. The flavor proves that the beer hasn�t gone bad, it just smells awful. Taste is bland and inoffensive. Very generic sweet corn syrup water. Overcarbonation makes this hard to drink, although I probably wouldn�t refuse one on a hot summer day. Microscopically thin body.
Arriba Light;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);This clear yellow beer poured with a massive white head the dissipated quickly, and a floral aroma. The thin flavor is a bit soapy and unpleasant.
Arriba Light;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Bottle from Grocery Outlet in Woodland, CA. Not a hint of skunk. Golden color with a multi-finger frothy white head. Quite clear. Aromas of grain, grass and dust. Near medium body with frothy carbonation. Flavor is grain and very light fruit and spice (probably noble type hop). For some reason it�s almost enjoyable. Not quite though. There is a bit of bitter in the finish.
Arriba Light;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Eh. Got this one for Christmas another beer to add to the list, but that�s about it. Pretty much identical to Corona Light in every respect: pale, odorless, and all but flavorless. On a hot summer day...I�d rather have water.
Arriba Light;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Looks exactly like the regular. Taste is lighter so it barely even tastes like beer. More like beer water. Not funky bad but not good either.
Arriba Light;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);This is not that much fun to drink, lacks any flavor, is way too light on body. Toasty and astringent, slightly corny.
Arriba Light;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Bottle: Pale straw, very clear, large white rocky head, fairly nice lacing, very light carbonation. � Corny aroma, wet sock and wet cardboard as well. � Blech, metallic oriented wet cardboard and graininess on the tongue. � Nasty trailer. � Body and mouthfeel are on the thin side. � At least the finish isn�t gross... thats because its amazingly bland at the finish. � Lingering astringent metallic twang.

Strohige, schwach ranzige Hopfenherbe, die aber doch Aromen von Kr�utertee und Zitrone preisgibt. Gut rezent, arg d�nn.

Pumphouse Firestone Double White;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Warm golden color with slight haze. Heavily perfumed nose and soapy, flowery flavors to match. Entertaining at first then quickly becomes a bath bomb.
Pumphouse Firestone Double White;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;"Draught at the brewery. Chuck that orange wedge on the rim post-haste. Did you see that scare email that was going around about how lemon wedges in restaurants are covered in fecal bacteria? Anyway... The beer is cloudy, medium-hued orange-straw gold with a small, off-white, clingy, foamy/creamy, mostly, quickly diminishing, but lasting head.The aroma is malty with light notes of toasted grain; Hoppy with moderate grassy herbal, floral notes; Yeasty wtih moderate/heavy notes of banana/clove; Miscellaneous notes of light/moderate orange zest, coriander.The flavor is moderately/heavily sweet, lightly acidic, trace bitter with a long, lightly/moderately sweet, lightly bitter finish. Residual spicy squeak on the palate, grainy retros seem dirty. Too sweet, lacking appropriate bitterness to bat clean up.The body is medium, the texture is watery and the carbonation is average.Not bad, but okay to skip it."
Pumphouse Firestone Double White;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draft: Cloudy peach. Thick, big-bubbled white foam. Sharp nose of cardamom, ginger, and yeast. Carbonation is hard and spritzy. Slippery body. Rounded notes of acidity are negated by a sweet and fruity orange-peel onslaught. Orange peels dominate the flavor by generating a dense marmalade sweetness. Prominent notes of alcohol and candy sugar do little more than muddle the underlying brightness. Finishes oversweet and redundant with yeast and a lingering blend of coriander and clove. Not a whole lot of imagination went into this, as it�s overly spicy and sweet.

Pours cloudy straw yellow with a medium foamy off-white head. Aroma is spicy herbs, flowers, ginger, vanilla, grassy earth, straw and hay malt, fragrant hops and corriander.

Amicas Raspberry Porter;Salida, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Amicas Pizza & Microbrew;"when i entered my favorite local brewpub recently, i asked the hired help if the brewer had anything ""big"" on tap for the holidays. of course, ""big"" means one thing to beer geeks, and something else entirely to the common citizenry. she said ""yes"" in an emphatic and enthusiastic way that caused me to fantasize about my imminent gustatory co-mingling with a barley wine or an imperial-- or at least a christmas strong ale. alas, the holiday special release is a raspberry porter-- but one served in a bomber-- hence, a ""big"" beer. fruit beers seldom rock my world, but i suppressed disappointment and decided to give the stupid thing a fair try. it�s a reasonable looking presentation: dark as dank ship timbers with a ruby cusp. moderate head, oatmeal cookie tan. aroma was mostly lost in the restaurant wood-fired pizza ambience, but i got some-- guess what?-- raspberry. i wished i could have called in snorky, my trained sniffer dog, but i had a thirst to deal with, so �raspberry� would have to do. it�s sadly thin of body (the beer, not my dog) and then a sharp carbonation meets a cranberry sauce metallic bitterness head on in a domestic disturbance that wasn�t pretty to witness. raspberry floundered everywhere trying to help, but really just adding to the tumult. finishes sweet, some devil�s food dark malt background and then all that odd puckering bitterness. not bad i suppose, but not what i had in mind-- tho finishing those 22 ounces turned out to be a ""big"" project after all."
Amicas Raspberry Porter;Salida, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Amicas Pizza & Microbrew;Salida, CO Beer Fest-22 oz bomber-pours a deep brown, almost black. very dark for a porter I thought. Nice tan head. Chocolate, smoke, peat, with a touch of that raspberry fruitiness going on. the flavors were not as good as the aroma. sour and chocolate. tasted like the malts were bad when they brewed this beer. This could have been kinda cool if done right, but this fell short of the mark

Hale's Icicle Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hale's Ales;On tap at the brewpub. Pale yellow with an ample white head. Slight hint of grass hops in the aroma, but there�s really not much there. Mouthfeel is watery, and I�m jumping straight to the mouthfeel in my rating because there�s really not much to say about the flavor. It�s not nasty the way that many macros are, but nor is there anything interesting or distinctive or even noticable on the tongue. This a watery, close-to-flavorless, light beer. Perhaps that was the aim, but I don�t want to revisit it.
Hale's Icicle Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hale's Ales;Blonde w. decent head retention. Not much as far as aroma. Easy hopping. Clean, crisp, and dull.
Hale's Icicle Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hale's Ales;think this little guy just got put on the blocks, this is hales lightest beer and for the bud drinkers, served escpecially frigid so when your cuttin the lawn everything is cool , some malty charcters and gin and juice. sweet!

Hale's London Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hale's Ales;Cask: Brown ruby, thick creamy tan head. The aroma smells like boiling wort the second you add hops with the sweetness coming through over the fresh planty hops. The flavor is balanced with a caramel residual sweetness. Good. Finishes refreshing, low carbonation.
Founders Organic Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Tap @ MBG, amber with a decent white head. Lots of c-hop in the aroma, with not much else going on overall. Very easy drink, just bland in general.
Founders Organic Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Dark orangey-amber. Light white head. Straightforward citric nose comes out grassy, grapefruity and rather sweet. The palate is drier too, the citric bite growing and somehow working to enhance to drinkability. Citrusy hops, toasted malts, no mistake, direct and kinda efficient pale ale. Light bodied, moderately high carbonation.
Founders Organic Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);MiBG Fest 2005: Tangerine hued with a small tight head and some lacing.

Founders Organic Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders for their 2004 Harvest Celebration. I liked this beer a bit more than I did the newly-tapped but otherwise similar Harvest Ale. Poured a hazy orange from the cask pull. Pine and citrus hops dominated the aroma, and piney hops also provided most of the flavor profile, rounded out by grapefruit rind and biscuity malt. Had a soapy, creamy mouthfeel the Harvest Ale lacked. I believe this was also hopped with Amarillo hops. A fine APA.
Founders Organic Pale Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On Tap @Logan�s Alley. Golden colored with a nice medium sized white head. Nice floral hop aroma and flavor, I believe this is a little hoppier than their regular pale, with a little bit of sweeet malt for balanced.

Kroghs Maibock;Sparta, New Jersey, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Kroghs Restaurant & Brew Pub;Brewery. Clear copper color with decent sized head and nice lacing. I should just shut up now, cause I was tought not to say anything if there�s not anything nice to say. But, the beer had a sweet lemon aroma and a tangy lemon and honey taste. The mouthfeel was way too lively. Thin bodied. Drainpour.
Alaskan Boogie Bitter;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Alaskan Brewing Company;"Draught Amber-foxy; fast disappearing yellow head. Nice clean hoppy nose, nowhere overdone. A bit cloying-cookie taste, hoppiness is needed to keep it in check. Slight burning MF, certain slickness. Good mainstream amber."
Alaskan Boogie Bitter;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Alaskan Brewing Company;"On tap at the Hangar in Juneau: Clear and copper in color. Crisp and lively carbonation. Lightish body; mouthfeel was a little watery at times, but not too bad. Malts were really nice -- toasted with sweet caramel overtones. Hop bitterness wasn�t very noticeable at first, but it built a little with time, and bitterness was more noticeable in the aftertaste. Hops had mild aromas and flavors of flowers and herbs; a little drying on the tongue. Overall, pretty good, but I would�ve liked it a little maltier and a little hoppier. But I suppose it�s a pretty good session beer, which is probably what was intended."
Trailhead K�lsch;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Trailhead Brewing Co.;New seasonal at the brewery. Pale gold with miniscule white head (but a tiny bit of lace). Hints of apple in the flavor. A bit thin.
River City Ale Works Boxcar Amber Ale;Wheeling, West Virginia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;River City Ale Works;Deep, pretty rich citrus-malt aroma. Brown-honeyish coloring. Well-hopped, nutty, with medium sweetness. Finishes very hoppy, and dries out. Sturdy mouth.
River City Ale Works Sweet Meade;Wheeling, West Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;River City Ale Works;Not a mead, but a honey fruit beer or a braggot at best. Quite nice fruit/berry/yeast aroma. I suspect champagne yeast and ale yeast. Very sweet, cherry fruit, abv obvious, a twinge of honey perhaps. Surgary and lacking bitterness. Long syrupy finish. A bit vacant at times. Gave me the ABV flush to the cheeks.
River City Ale Works J. D. Grand Black and Tan;Wheeling, West Virginia, United States;Stout;River City Ale Works;Chocolate, citrus, diacetyl aroma. Rootbeer brown but still transparent. Smooth, moderately sweet and not bitter. Fruity hops, cocoa and butter. Mild tasting for all its darkness. Medium weight to slightly thick. Orangey malt finish. Needs refinement.
River City Ale Works Double Batch Oatmeal Stout;Wheeling, West Virginia, United States;Stout;River City Ale Works;Milky, somewhat diacetyl and strongly tart aroma. This was either an amateur attempt, or just green, or a bad batch or some combination of all three. Way, way too tart -- like the bad oat twang you sometimes get in homebrew. Sweet-tart and earthy. Sample the next batch before you buy!

Bishops Arms House Lager;Alafors, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ahlafors Bryggerier;Draught at Bishops Arms, Gothenburg, Sweden. Ruby with a bubbly, quickly diminishing head.

Barley's Kona Coffee Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap at Barleys. A pretty black pour with a wispy head. A bit smoky with a fair bit of roasty grain and plenty of coffee. Just a touch of sharpness to the aroma as well. The flavor is burnt grain with a touch of sharp black pat. The coffee is a combination of flavors such as nutty acidic molasses. Medium body with a wet mouth feel but semi-dry finish. A fairly drinkable stout.
Barley's Kona Coffee Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Barley's Brewing Company;Growler. Nice roastiness from the coffee right up front but the problem I have with this stout is the body is just too thin for the coffee to stand ip to it. Throw in the milkiness and all I have here is dark coffee water.
Barley's Kona Coffee Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Barley's Brewing Company;Draught at smokehouse.. Poured black with a good size tan head that stayed pretty well and laced some on the sides of the glass. Aromas of coffee, and a touch of hops. Nice full flavor coffee, a touch of chocolate, and roasted malts. Palate was meduim bodied and smooth and creamy on the tongue. A nice drinkable stout and a good compliment to the pulled chicken sandwich..
Barley's Kona Coffee Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Barley's Brewing Company;Decent coffee stout... beer is heavy enough overall to counter the coffe bitterness. Kona coffee is always nice. Hoppy as well. Remembering from Strong Ale with no notes, so I won�t write much, hehe.
Barley's Kona Coffee Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Barley's Brewing Company;"7/10/04: Barleys Smokehouse. Very opaque black body with a minimal head. Nose of coffee and malt. Quick notes of coffee upfront- but the coffee flavor leaves very quickly. Other flavors include malt and Novocain. My tongue felt numb after a few sips. Barley�s has great beer; this is not one of them. The recipe for this beer needs worked out a bit more."
Barley's Kona Coffee Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Barley's Brewing Company;"Had this on tap at the Smokehouse Saturday night prior to seeing the Crew play for the first time. Light nose of caramel and coffee. Pours a dark walnut. Though I requested a head from my server, I was served sans the bubbles; but I noticed a tall frothy light brown head when a few of my buddies split one upon dividing pour. No lacing was visible in any of the glasses. The flavor has great hints of chickory coffee and is very even keeled with a subtle finish. The full and dry body is very lively with an astringent feel to the finish."
Barley's Kona Coffee Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Barley's Brewing Company;On draught at the Smokehouse. The beer is a dark brown color that lets a little ruby light through. Thin light brown head and quick lacing. The aroma is all coffee, but really not that strong. Rich body, but the carbonation level seems kind of high making it a little harder to drink. Roasted coffee and a hint of chocolate in the flavor. The finish is dry with notes of hops and dark chocolate. This isn�t Barley�s best Stout, being kind of 2-dimensional. However it is pretty tasty and enjoyable.
Barley's Kona Coffee Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Barley's Brewing Company;Dark brown with a small white head. Weak coffee aroma. Flavor of coffee and roast with some bitter chocoalte at the end. Body is pretty thin and watery.
Pfaffen Original;Lohmar, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Brauerei zum Pfaffen;Pours a clear golden yellow on tap with fluffy white foam that dissipates slowly to leave moderate lace. Aroma of herbal and zesty hop notes over pale biscuit malts and a lightly metallic yeast note. Taste follows, good balance of hops and malt, but a little heavy on the yeast, and kind of like its been sitting on it too long. Or maybe the barrel it is served out of wasn't cleaned or sealed completely. Not my favorite in Koln.

Hofbr�u M�nchen Delicator Doppelbock (-2014);Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Hofbr�uhaus M�nchen;Pours a deep mahogany with a tight medium sized off white head that leaves a decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is rich with lots of toffee & caramel without coming off as overly sugary... It�s got some light chocolate and is lightly boozy. It�s a big malty inviting aroma... not always something I�m after but it�s hard for me not to be drawn in by this one. The flavor is as expected, very malty. It�s a sweet beer but doesn�t quite get into the cloying territory. It�s got an alcohol spiciness and just enough herbal hop character to bring some balance to it. It�s got a nice chocolate on toffee thing happening and a little bit of cooked fruit. Maybe it was the right beer at the right time, but I really dig this... and I went in with very low expectations.
Schreckenskammer K�lsch;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Brauhaus Schreckenskammer;Many thanks for this Koln beer to Koelschtrinker. Poured into Kuppers Kolsch glass. Piwo nudne, nie jest specjalnie ani nowofalowe, bardzo proste i klasyczne w odbiorze. Piana jest tylko fajna, trwala utrzymuje sie naprawde sporo czasu.

P�ffgen K�lsch;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Hausbrauerei P�ffgen;Pours a clear golden orange on tap with thick white peaks of foam that leaves good lace as it dissipates. Aroma of mild floral hops over light biscuit and a touch of fruity kolsch yeast. Taste is more of the malt and yeast than the hops, with a touch of diacetyl and metallic notes underneath. Again, might be the barrel its served out of, but maybe also poor yeast health.

P�ffgen K�lsch;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Hausbrauerei P�ffgen;If you do want to drink K�lsch (and I very rarely do) this is the one you are most likely to enjoy - imo, of course. Grassier and hoppier than most others, with a fairish level of bitterness. It goes well with the type of food served in the P�ffgen brewery pub in Cologne... i.e. fairly basic German grub (but prepared quite nicely and with a bit of imagination). Pointwise, I'm probably underrating it, because I associate the entire K�lsch style with booziness... sloppily served and greedily drunk. But that's obviously a feature of Cologne pub culture rather than a shortcoming of any individual beer.

Marston's The Full Butt;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Porter;Marston's;Cask Conditioned at The Pump House, Bristol. Dark brown red with virtually no head. in the early days of Porter the beer was a mix of three others, some London Brewers managed to brew in one barrel, which took a year to mature and became known as Full Butt and eventually Porter from those who drank it. This I doubt is very similar to those soured beers as it is quite smooth an underflavoured, it has got a burnt chocolate malt flavour though whic was the new development with Porters, interesting, but not great.

Brauhaus Sternen Hefe-Weissbier Hell;Frauenfeld, Switzerland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauhaus Sternen;bottle, labelled Weizen Trumpf, bought at the brewery. Cloudy pale yellow, small head. Full-bodied, malty and yeasty with hints of banana. Reminds me of Belgian Witbiers, because of the hints of spices and orange peel.
Brauhaus Sternen Hefe-Weissbier Hell;Frauenfeld, Switzerland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauhaus Sternen;"(bottle, 4,8% ABV, as Weizen Trumpf, with thanks to quack-duck!) Cloudy, orange colour with a dense foamy white head. Initially grassy aroma, something what I definitely not expect from a Hefeweizen (green-glass bottle effect). Furthermore it has the yeasty house character, plus notes of fruits (banana, pear) and clove and band aid phenols. Moderately sweet flavour, light bodied with a quite smooth carbonation for a Weizen. Yeasty, malty taste with a moderate wheat-character and notes of banana; medium, dry, light-sweet, slightly tart finish with a light clovy spice and some yeasty bitterness in the light fruity aftertaste. Not very balanced. All in all rather unconvincing."

Felstar Lord Kulmbach;Dunmow, Essex, England;Stout;Felstar;23rd September 2007 Warning! Early amateur rating! Very dark beer. Marmite and smoke - hard work when fridge cold. Mellows a bit as it warms up but a long way from being me favourite Felstar.
Felstar Lord Kulmbach;Dunmow, Essex, England;Stout;Felstar;Bottle, 50 cl. Bought @ Bab festival. Dark brown color, with creamy beige head. Aroma stron roasted malts dark fruits. Medium to full body. Taste very strong roasted dark malts, fruity.

Liquorice, dry, even wry bitter taste, leafy, and lots of dark malts. Very slick, rather well-bodied, but ending a bit empty. Not very impressive, and even after a long explanation of the brewer, I�m still at a loss WHICH Kulmbacher beer - he speaks about a style? - is meant.
Felstar Lord Kulmbach;Dunmow, Essex, England;Stout;Felstar;A Mes rate: Bottle at Chelmsford Beer Festival. Black and reasonably thick in the body. Malty nose with plenty of interesting dark fruit. Heavy fruity malt flavour with plums and something that reminds me of a good chunky steak. Full bodied with a well balanced finish. Pretty good I thought.
Felstar Lord Kulmbach;Dunmow, Essex, England;Stout;Felstar;Bottled conditioned. A black beer with a massive tan coloured head. This head is partly due to the fact it�s an English BC beer as this oten happens. In spite of the label�s claim, I did find it roasty. In fact both the aroma and taste were burnt and very stouty. A pleasant enough beer, but we can�t bottle condition very well on this island!

Hazy amber with white, unfortunately fizzed, head. Heavy carbonation unfortunately, but we did have the time to let it settle down in the warm, sunny garden. It ended up as a fairly pleasant, dry, malty beer, some apricot notes and a hint of bread dough. It�s fine when left a while.
W�rzburger Zwickelbier;W�rzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;W�rzburger Hofbr�u (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Draught @ the keller. Hazy dull straw. Dusty yeast aroma. Sweetish, a bit footy, with light yeast. Fairly bland. Definitely unterfranken.
W�rzburger Zwickelbier;W�rzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;W�rzburger Hofbr�u (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Draft @ brewery tap Wurzburg. Nicely hazed, yellow gold, thick stable head. Yeasty aroma. Fruity malt and sticky palate. Sweet.
W�rzburger Zwickelbier;W�rzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;W�rzburger Hofbr�u (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Draught at their Keller. Pretty glowing yellow, almost pastel, with a high, smooth, head. Very cereally aroma, slightly earthy. Flavor is just like breakfast cereal�very grainy�need a spoon�with a touch of esters and citrus, but unfortunately very low hopping. Nice malts, though, and a relatively dry finish. Tasty and original, but the wine here is better.
W�rzburger Zwickelbier;W�rzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;W�rzburger Hofbr�u (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);At the brewpub in Wuerzburg. Head is initially average sized, frothy/creamy, white, mostly lasting. Body is hazy medium yellow. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted bread/grain), lightly yeasty (dough, basement). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. Pretty basic, straightforward rendition that doesn�t show that much character. It relies mostly on its malt in the nose, and although it�s pretty simple it�s pleasant. Good balance too, but the best things about it are its appearance and creamy mouthfeel. A 40 min (or so) walk from the train station that didn�t pay off as well as hoped, but still a fun quaff.
W�rzburger Zwickelbier;W�rzburg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;W�rzburger Hofbr�u (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Only can get this beer at the Wuerzburg Hofbrau restaurant (at least it�s the only place I�ve seen it). Superb malty flavor. Good head - cloudy appearance. Great taste - smooth malty flavor - next to no bitterness. A great beer.
Wild Rose Half Wit;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wild Rose Brewery;Pours a nice cloudy dirty yellow,with a good white head,it has a very mild,sweet nose. On taste:Mild flavour.Citrus,wheat and malt on the start,and not as sweet as it smells.In the middle I can just taste the blackberry�s and get a sense of a mild Belgian yeast. This is a tart and very refreshing beer cold.If you let it warm up just a little,it gets much better,and more flavours and tones come through. I like the higher then average carbonation,brings some nice mouth appeal to the beer. A enjoyable beer!
Wild Rose Half Wit;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wild Rose Brewery;Mild aroma of wheat and blackberry with some fruity esters. Hazy straw coloured with thin, white fully diminishing head. Mild wheat flavour with hints of blackberry. Gentle tartness in the finish. Palate is somewhat still though mouthfeel is thick and wheaty. Bottle. Thanks Presario.
Wild Rose Half Wit;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wild Rose Brewery;"I was going to enter this as a fruit beer but as it is already up... Like a cloudy dark glass of grapefuit juice. White head of medium bubbles sinks slowly. Blackberry and yeast scents merge into one aroma. Blackberry flavour builds to the bottom of the bottle/glass. Refreshing, not overly yeasty or overly fruity. Tart around the edges. As a fruit beer; above average."
Wild Rose Half Wit;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wild Rose Brewery;Aroma of citrus grapefruit, spices. Pours a murky orange-pink, foamy white head. Chunky yeast floaties. Looks like cloudy grapefruit juice. Flavour falls a little flat. Slight acids and not much pop in the finish. Much more interesting when it was on cask at the 2003 Calgary Real Ale festival.
South Street Smoked Summer Porter;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;South Street Brewery;"Appearance is black as night, beautiful, with a nice, frothy head. Poured from a nitro tap. Smells like ordinary porter, very little smokiness in there. Taste is very porterlike, without any hints of smoke. Very disappointed with it being called ""smoked,"" yet a good beer altogether."
21st Amendment Bavarian Hefeweizen;San Leandro, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;21st Amendment Brewery;Standard strong clove hefeweizen taste. Ok, but not great. squeezed the lemon in it to cut the annoying spiced taste. just like every other hefeweizen you�ve ever had. boring.
21st Amendment Bavarian Hefeweizen;San Leandro, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;21st Amendment Brewery;Called House Hefeweizen. Hazy blonde with a pleasant banana aroma and bubble gum. Sweet wheat and bubble gum in mouth, very nice. Medium bodied. No slugs in mine. (June 2004).
21st Amendment Bavarian Hefeweizen;San Leandro, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;21st Amendment Brewery;Fresh, citrus aroma with banana notes. The bartender put a lemon slice in the beer before I could stop him, but, although I could smell some lemon in the aroma, it didn�t ruin the beer. Very cloudy, yellow body. Virtually no head. White to off-white head. Not much lace. Good wheat flavor. Very solid wheat.
Weyerbacher Heresy;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;2005 vintage from trade. I traded for a bunch of Weyerbachers long time ago, and this is the first one I've opened in a long time. It's to make up for being required to spend time with my family instead of going to FoBAB 2019. The 2005 label only mentions oak barrel aging, but right under the cap is a big snootful of bourbon and vanillin. Plenty of carbonation in this one. In fact the tan foam stays pretty stiff until my lips touch it. Solid black beer color beneath it. After 14 years, the taste is still quite nice. Plenty of roasty malt, a bit of cherry cola taste, backed by coffee and molasses. Yes, there's still some sweetness to it, but the malt tells it to keep its mouth shut. Nothing here has gone off. Just a fine imperial stout that's picked up a good load of bourbon barrel taste and has not let go over all this time.
Weyerbacher Heresy;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;04.04.2015, 0,35l bottle (2007 vintage) @ Akkurat Bar & Restaurant: Nice light brown creamy mediumlasting head. Aroma is mild and slightly sweet sour-ish, dark sugar, dark malts, oak, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, grass, mild bourbon. Taste is very mild, dark malts, caramel, chocolate pudding, vanilla, grass, coffee, oak, hay, dark sugar, mild bourbon, cocoa. Medium bitterness, very mild velvety mouthfeel. Nice and extremely easy drinking for the ABV.
Weyerbacher Heresy;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Pretty much an average Imperial Stout. Nice near black appearnce...thick with good lacing. Dark mocha head that is on the lighter side. The aroma isn't all that great, sort of soy-sauceish...but a lot of imperial stouts are like that from the higher alcohol content. Tastes of chocolate malt, not too much hops going on with this one....good balanced flavor though. At first I thought it was a bit sour (maybe from the fruits goin on), but grew on me towards the end. Good sipping beer, a little pricey though. Worth the try, but dunno if I'd be buying again in the near future.
Weyerbacher Heresy;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Pours black with foamy, 3 finger head that dissipates without lacing. Aroma is whiskey with a hint of chocolate malt. Malt flavor is taken over by whiskey notes. Aftertaste adds a bourbon flavor. A very drinkable barrel-aged stout, but not exceptional.
Weyerbacher Heresy;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Pour is a complete black with a small tan head. Aroma is a nice roasted/chared malt with a barely there barrel. The barrel becomes more apparent as this warms. Flavor is is a decent roasted malt, plenty of vanilla and a minor oak. Much like the aroma the oak shows itself more as this gets up to room temperature. This was a solid offering.
Weyerbacher Heresy;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Tap at Clubhouse BFD. Pours black, tan head. Aroma is bourbon, chocolate, some esters, dark fruit, fig, plum, toffee, vanilla.Flavor is drinking fruit, astringency, dark fruit, esters. Wow, poorly executed.
Weyerbacher Heresy;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Pours a very dark with nearly no head. Dark roast , dark chocolate and coconut nose. Dark malt, dark chocolate , marshmallow, coffee, and coconut.
Weyerbacher Heresy;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;The aroma has a boozy whiskey front note. I don�t smell chocolate or coffee so much, but the vanilla is there. The appearance is very black, like flat root beer. You have to shake this thing up to get any head out of it. I�ve had other imperial barrel aged stouts before, ones that have far higher abv�s. This one tastes like a stronger beer than 8.2%. Perhaps it�s the stronger bourbon aroma playing a trick on the brain, but I�ve had stouts 4-5 percentage points higher abv that go down a lot smoother. It has a mouth feel similar to red wine, and a warming sensation similar to a Pinot Noir. Overall a very good beer, and similar to Weyerbacher�s bold style. I personally prefer Dragons Milk, but it�s a solid beer in the category.
Weyerbacher Heresy;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Pours a velvety black with minimal brown head. Smells of cocoa and vanilla. Taste is sweet and bitter - coffee and cocoa.
Weyerbacher Heresy;Easton, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Vtg blackberry backlog. Bottle, Pours black with brown head. Aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malts, toasty coffee, vanilla, and plum. Very warming stout with a fair bit of balance. I like it for the most part.
Goose Island Imperial Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);2006, opened with PhineasGage when he was in town. Pours a nice dark tawny with a fleeting sheet of light tan foam. Smells sweet and rich. Lots of nougat, vanilla, toasted malts and a bit of turbinado. Taste was dark malt, nutty brown character, some oak, a bunch more vanilla, some cocoa (really faint), plenty of oxidized malts and a good leathery tone. Medium on full bodied with a watery feel from the seemingly lower carbonation. Happy to have had it, wouldn�t probably search for it again.
Goose Island Imperial Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampled at the 2012 American Craft Beer Festival. Pours brown. Hoppy for the style, and a lot of caramel malts. Average texture. A good beer.
Goose Island Imperial Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);(Mislabeled rating from 9/25/09) Poured into a small glass as part of Goose Island beer and cheese tasting at Teller�s in Cincinnati. The Goose Island rep brought bottles and said the ABV was actually lower than 8%, so this isn�t the �Bourbon� Imperial Brown Goose. Anyway, this one pours a hazy dark brown with a small off-white head. Aroma is oak, vanilla, sweet toasted malts, earth, brown sugar, and caramel. However, none of this is too overpowering. The flavor follows the same profile, and once again strikes just the right balance. Medium bodied, smooth, sweet, with mild carbonation. The relatively low ABV is surprising.
Goose Island Imperial Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Light brown pour with a thick tan head. The nose has a nice soft spiciness. A little bit of noble character and some interesting light cocoa notes. A mix of toffee and milk chocolate that works quite well with the sort of piny spiciness of the hops. There is a little bit of lightly spicy astringency that starts to come up, but it still works quite well. As it warms up there is a touch of lightly sweet plumminess and a touch of soft earthiness as well. Pretty solid beer. It drinks like a slightly amped up Honkers� it has the sort of spicy/malty balance that I enjoy in that beer so much.
Goose Island Imperial Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Location: Tap at RnH, 4/17/10 Aroma: The nose is has some fruity notes, booze, and yeast Appearance: Pours a hazy, dark brown color with a brown head Flavor: Taste has a sort of Belgian yeast feel, some fruity sweetness, malts, and booze Palate: The mouthfeel is a bit boozy, yeasty, somewhat Belgian, and with a medium body Overall Impression: I liked this stuff, it felt sort of like a Belgian beer more then a brown ale. The flavor is pretty good. It is on the complex side for sure. Pretty good stuff.
Goose Island Imperial Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at Rattle n Hum. Pretty decent, although I think this keg may have been a little old. Poured a dark, cloudy brown. Almost no head. Aroma of mild sourness and brown sugar. Some tartness up front, then sweetness, with big molasses flavors, nutmeg, vanilla, graham cracker and gingerbread. Medium bodied, alcohol isn�t too perceptible. Finish is somewhat sweet. Overall, I would want less - or no - sourness and more maltiness. But again, could have been the keg.
Goose Island Imperial Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft @ Acadia Cafe: A glistening golden brown with a modest tan head. Wispy lacing. Nose is heavily bourbon and barrel notes, light roast and faint caramel. The taste is bourbon oriented with a light woody note, roast, caramel, butterscotch, and vanilla. What starts off a little one-dimensional, ala bourbon bomb, the flavors emerge as the glass warms. I don�t think it was served too cold, it just was best near room temp.
Goose Island Imperial Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at the Brickhouse BBQ in Madison, WI - Dark brown pour, cloudy with a small bubbly brown head. Smells of mild, sweet vanilla, light hazelnut, rich toffee, and lots of sweet notes integrated perfectly with smooth malt and just a touch of booze. Wow. Tastes sweet with lots of caramel, nice vanilla and bourbon notes, and a touch of cherry.The bourbon is sweet, subtle, and not distracting--this is what barrel aging should do to a beer. Absolutely fabulous.
Goose Island Imperial Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);[Tap] Pours a opaque dark brown color with a thin tan head. Heavy and sweet aroma of bourbon, vanilla and hazelnut. Molasses and butterscotch backbone in the taste. Some roasted coffee and cocoa round it out. An earthy and woody finish. A good amount of noticeable alcohol keeps this beer from getting cloying. This stuff was pretty darn good!

Smells of some hops and not much else. Taste is hops, some sweetness, and some lemon sourness. Needs more malt. Mouthfeel is light. Boring, but may make a good session beer.
Goose Island Summers Best Bitter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Growler, 2005 version: golden summer haze � thin, off-white film. Zesty orange-hop sweetness in the aroma mixed with lemon flesh and a mild bitterness. Smooth, but well textured mouth feel and a great hop freshness. Biscuity malts play a great supporting role, but don�t over power. Malted, bitter orange flavours throughout the finish. Very nice.
Flying Bison Barleywine;Buffalo, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Bison Brewing;Growler from hopson. Drunk out of my new Stone Old Gaurdian glass.

Flying Bison Barleywine;Buffalo, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Bison Brewing;Note: last beer @ Pizza Plant 2004 tasting. My tounge was kinda dead by now. Very soft nose for a barleywine. Sweet, subdued floral hops, brown sugar. Flavor is great, but too much alcohol is apparent! I don�t know if this needs to be aged or if my palate is destroyed or what. This reminds me of Olde School and would be amazing if I didn�t get that alcohol burn from it. I hope this gets release, but I hope it ends up a bit smoother. Or maybe my tounge was trashed :)
Flying Bison Barleywine;Buffalo, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Bison Brewing;Though served on the cold side in an effort to preserve, it seemed very much like a simple U.K. barley wine. A good amount of barley and assertive use of hops. A very limited edition

The aroma has decent strength with citrus, near grassy hops mixed with stale wet cardboard maltiness, cherries and faint caramel. The taste is much the same starting with a pulse of hops and cherry cough syrup and mild stale maltiness. By midway the hops grow to become pine and grapefruit as a modest roasted malt note is noticed. It ends stale, mildly hoppy and with the hops lingering into the after taste.

Broken Tooth Jack Straw Rye;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a clear golden color. Foamy white head dissipates at a nice pace leaving some stringy lace. The aroma had some spicy rye, some grass, subtle grainy sweetness and then some black pepper. The flavor brings all of the previously mentioned aromas together and bringing in a touch of herbal quality about it. Moderate spicy sort of aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionabilty about it. Decent carbonation. ABV felt as appropriate as the brewer projected. Overall, nice rye beer worthy of having many more pours if I could get it again.

Broken Tooth Moonflower ESB;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;6/19/2009: Looking for something different, I decided to go for the Moonflower ESB and I�m glad that I did. This medium-bodied, honey-colored beer has a beige head, a bright, citrusy hop aroma, and a great balance of caramel malts and bitterness (mild to mdoerate level) in the flavor. Another damn fine session beer with lots of great flavor! Draught (sample) at The Moose�s Tooth in Anchorage, Alaska. Rating #13 for this beer.

Coronado Hoppy Daze IPA;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;Golden ale color. Light whispy head. Goes down smoothly. Just the right amount of hops making for a great finish.
Coronado Hoppy Daze IPA;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;Tap at Sidedoor. Filtered tan-yellow-orange. Real clean filtered body. A pretty solid Belgian IPA. Big, fruity yeast esters. Quality offering, nice merge between West Coast and Belgian. Very drinkable, really well done. Great balance.
Coronado Hoppy Daze IPA;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;"February 2nd, 2014 - Coronado�s fusion style Hoppy Daze is an engaging brew, coming out of their ""Crown Series"" which in my limited experience goes above and beyond the regular line-up to fold in more dynamic and interesting flavors. To the eye, Hoppy Daze has all the markings of an IPA, a chilled frosty gold color clouding the glass, and less than a finger of styrofoam colored head atop. Banana and cream comprise the aroma, pushing less clove than I�d expect from the Belgian yeast treatment, and switching in more white grape juice, though just a touch as an accent. The palate, given the style, is thick and heavy, with an appreciable dose of alcohol. It�s good company for the occasion of a Super Bowl Halftime Show, bold enough to cut through lackluster live performances and keep my attention. As I veer away from the television I catch more banana and graham cracker sweetness, and even a dash of cookie spiciness. Likely a product of the yeast, but distinct from the clove, it�s proportional to the other flavors and delicious. Better this than football, I think, and so I retreat to a quieter corner to enjoy the rest of this without the plastic clacking of footballs and stressed cartilage."
Coronado Hoppy Daze IPA;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;650 ml. Clear golden-amber with a sticky meringue of foam. Nose is honey with the beeswax, resin, toast and a touch of grapefruit zest. Flavors of lemon honey, cardboard, toast and mint. Medium body is smooth with light-medium carbonation and a nice balance.
Coronado Hoppy Daze IPA;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;Bomber poured to cup. Pale yellow, minimal activity. Sappy pine, citrus hops. Light and clean grapefruit, not pithy, decent aftertaste.

Coronado Hoppy Daze IPA;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;Poured from 22 oz. bottle. Clear, golden straw color with a yellowish-white head and very good lacing. Aroma of flower nectar, grapefruit, pine, tropical fruit, yeast and pale malt. Taste of grapefruit, tropical fruit, sweet malt, pine and coriander. Full/medium body and medium/low carbonization with a smooth mouthfeel. This beer has a strong Belgian tripel character, yet with heavy West Coast-style hopping. It is surprisingly sweet, but with ample hop bittering for balance. It's unusual, but quite good. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Coronado Hoppy Daze IPA;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;Big hop single IPA. Earthy and maple like hop aroma, excellent and different at same time. Malt is slightly sweet but hops balance it out very nicely. Great carbonation to bring out hop aroma.
Coronado Hoppy Daze IPA;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;I am not sure why this scored out so low. The aroma was strong, fresh, and floral.

Granville Island Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);First off, this limited release from Granville Island, for summer, is not one of their best offerings. That said, it pours with a light gold colour and an adequate white head. Both the aroma and taste have too much malt and note enough hops for a Bohemian, and the taste is a tad sweet as well. Otherwise, taste is decently crisp but more hops, please!
Granville Island Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);The pilsner is one of the exceptions in an otherwise bland, pedestrian selection of craft brews from Granville Island. Unfortunately it is rarely available. It looks, taste, and finishes far better than most GI beers and is a straightforward example of a pilsner.
Granville Island Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Hazy golden pils with a creamy white head. Nice herbal hops, with a bit of horseblanket notes. Light crisp malt with lots of german hops, crisp bitterness. Medium bodied. Very pleasant pils from GIB. Merci, JM.
Granville Island Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);From the bottle: Pours a deep gold with medium white head. Decent retention as well. Aroma is grassy/woody with malt undertones. Slight skunky-hop but very understated. Flavour is malty with a slightly sweet fruity middle. A nice (not too) skunky-hop bitter finish. Overall I would pick this pilsner over many European ones any day. Very drinkable.
Granville Island Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Gold with decent white head.Light spicy hop nose.Slightly spicy, light bitterness, light malt profile. A bit on bland side
Granville Island Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Golden colour with slightly rocky head. Appley, spicy hop aroma with background maltiness. Lightly bitter, with some breadcrusty malt notes and hints of herbal hops. Fairly smooth and clean, but disappointingly bland for a GI seasonal.
Granville Island Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);This is like a lite version of their very good IPA.I would have expected better from Granville Is. It is pretty true to style but I wish they had pumped up the flavour(hops) alittle and backed off the malt start. Nice looking beer on the pour and nothing offensive in the nose. It is smooth and sweet and has a nice hop middle with a sweet end that manages to dry up,but just. A good basic beer..but not a true pilsner more like a incredibly good Canadian molsen..
Granville Island Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);From a 650ml special release. Colour is golden with a decent size white head. Aroma is malty with the noticeable Saaz hops to complement the nose. Flavour is not great, a little too thin and nothing that grabs you. Aftertaste is bland and not bitter as I expected. Not one of Granville Island�s best.
Granville Island Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Pale golden colour, thick white head, fading quicly to thin lace. Salty pale malt aroma, prominent grassy and flowery Saaz hops in the nose. Very thin body, little flavour, but a crisp finish. It�s refreshing enough, but it doesn�t seem like enough bitterness to really qualify as a pilsener.
Granville Island Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Granville Island Brewing (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Golden in color with a light Saaz aroma. Light body with an almost wort sweet malt flavour and a small ammount of Saaz to back it up with. Seemed ok with the first sip but the sugary sweetness really gets to you after a while.
Thunder Canyon Prescription Pils;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Tap @ Brewery. Aroma had some some spice and sweet notes. Gold body with white head. First gulp a bittering blast hit and I thought wow this isn�t going to be good. Bitterness subsided rather quickly and a citric acid and grain rest of way down the hatch. Was a good light body refreshment on a hot day.
Thunder Canyon Prescription Pils;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thunder Canyon Brewery;On tap @ TCB - Pours a crystal clear light golden color with a small white head. Thin lacing. Aroma is light grain and noble hops. Flavor is light grain with a bit of bitterness. Light to medium body. A well made, easy drinking light beer.
Thunder Canyon Prescription Pils;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Golden with little aroma. Soapy characteristics. Slippery on the tongue. Tart but the hops come out as a detergent-like essence.
Thunder Canyon Prescription Pils;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Pours a clear gold color, and is topped with a white head that leaves a nice bit of lacing as I work my way through the glass. The nose is slightly spicy with notes of grass and grain. The taste finishes with a nice light bite of hop bitterness. This is nice and clean just like a good lager should be. It has a nice subtle mix of grain character and spicy hop flavor. This is quite refreshing and a good example of a light Pils, with no apparent flaws. A bit more spicy hop flavor would be more to my liking but this is a good attempt nonetheless.
Thunder Canyon Obsidian Porter;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Porter;Thunder Canyon Brewery;A good smoky flavor with no aftertaste. Goes very well with food. Toasted with a hint of coffee for a dry finish.

Thunder Canyon Obsidian Porter;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Porter;Thunder Canyon Brewery;finally made the trip down JUST for this beer! pours a darker version of the typical burgundy brown porter... nearly black with a slight haze and lasting tan ring for a head. lots of roast on the nose without any sign of ashiness... lactose, wood, a touch of cocoa, fruit (though i don�t know which) and some floral hops. the palate is dry... almost chalky on the finish... flavors in between of chocolate, slight char, toasty grain, floral hops and a peppery kind of spice. it is very well balanced... safe enough for tux and plenty for the nerds to enjoy. medium bodied with a soft texture and thick/rich mouth feel from carbonation. 7/4.5/7/4/16/3.9
Thunder Canyon Obsidian Porter;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Porter;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Good dark color and aromas. Full nectar with strong flavors. This one holds it�s own for a porter and finishes with good length. Nice job guy�s.

Thunder Canyon Obsidian Porter;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Porter;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Fresh growler courtesy of cbkschubert. Pours dark brown with a thin soapy head. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate, some dark fruit, and spicy. Tastes of dark chocolate, bitter hops, and splashes of peppery spiciness. More hoppy than I�m used to in a porter. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side. Finishes slightly bitter with some sweet maltiness.
Thunder Canyon Obsidian Porter;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Porter;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Nice dark roasted flavor. It�s a bit thin, but a vast improvement over their Blackout stout.
Thunder Canyon Obsidian Porter;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Porter;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Draft at brewery. Dark brown with tan head. Chocolate on the nose. Some coffee too. Light on the flavor. on the mouthfeel too. Not bad though.
Fearless Bavarian Weizen;Estacada, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fearless Brewing Company;I really enjoyed this beer. It was a warm day and I was sitting outside enjoying the pizza bread. This was as close to a german wheat as I have had. One of my favorites from this bar. A little hoppier then I care for in a wheat, but a good choice.
Fearless Bavarian Weizen;Estacada, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fearless Brewing Company;Thick cloudy tan colored with a ring of head & lacing. The aroma is chock full of the traditional banana/clove esters & plenty of clean wheat. Other notes of bubblegum & coriander spices. The flavor has just the right amount of tangy wheat & hallertau hops. Spicy fruity finish and no alcohol presence. Damn near perfect example of a german wheat. All it�s missing is that distinct caramelized complexity you can only get from a decoction mash.
BJ's The Burnside Malt Liquor;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Malt Liquor;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Well I had to try it for the novelty, can�t say it was a good brew, but i guess much better than most malt liqours. Pours a pale yellow with a small fast falling white head. Not so much a chemically aroma, but still slightly skunky and cheap smelling. Taste still has that corn taste to it, very light malts and a very mild finishing of hops. Eh, it fun to order a malt liqour on tap i guess.
BJ's The Burnside Malt Liquor;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Malt Liquor;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;GABF 2004. Clear, pale golden body. Honey and citrus tones with some light nuttiness. Corn is apparent as well. Not bad for a malt liquor.
BJ's The Burnside Malt Liquor;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Malt Liquor;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;BJ�s Lloyd CenterPale golden color, nearly clear. Light fizzy white head. The aroma is lightly fruity with some alcohol notes & corn, very fruity flavor with almost nothing but 6-row in the finish. It�s like spiced water almost. Unique.

Sweet toast-malty nose with caramel. Sweet flavour with roasty bitter notes; light bodied with a soft carbonation.

Patagonia Pale Ale;Valdivia, Chile;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cervecer�a Kunstmann;Tasting from Jan� 2010. Cap came off with no sound at all leaving me wondering if this beer was still or not and yes, it was lifeless on the pour. Dead, sparkling amber body with a few floaties seemingly caught in suspended animation. Prominent oxidisation evident to the nose, rust, a little stewed rhubarb, toffee and candy sugar present. Taste has a rusty, slightly tannic air. A crystal malt sweetness balances a dry, dusty malt mid-palate with a nice bitter edge in the back. Malty and woody with a little more hops fade into the swallow. Aftertaste has a little pine resin also. A tickle of residual carbonation sees it has life left, the body medium-light. I don�t know whether its improved with oxidation as I can�t compare it with a fresh sample but it seems to go down a treat. Like a cask bitter in this state, I know its faults but I just kept drinking. (33cL, BBE 09/09, The Beer Store Morley)
Patagonia Pale Ale;Valdivia, Chile;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cervecer�a Kunstmann;Had this bottle while sitting in a kabab shop waiting on my kabab on the way home, score in terms of rates! Bottle as: Valdivia Pale ale. Carbonated cardboard, hop exstract, general poor beer characteristics that my notes dont care to tell me much of.
Patagonia Pale Ale;Valdivia, Chile;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cervecer�a Kunstmann;Looked ok as I poured it into the glass, clear amber body with a good head but didn�t last at all. Some caramel and corn in the aroma, with the taste the caramel is not as pronounced but as a APA I expect a lot more hops. Boring.

Patagonia Pale Ale;Valdivia, Chile;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cervecer�a Kunstmann;A clear Amber color with an off-white head. Sweet, rich caramel scent. Initial sweetness of caramel (Crystal Malts?) but not much after that. Still, not too bad.
Orion Special Karakuchi;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);Yeah ok yet another from the local Okinawan brewery Orion. Not really too much special about this one. Pours out light golden yellow with a small head that isn�t really worth a comment, you�ve seen this many times before. Aroma is slightly tart, some hops (but very few), and a touch of sweetness from the malts. Taste is pretty much the same slightly tart and actually comes off pretty dry for the finish. This one seemed much more carbonated than thier other offerings for some reason.
Orion Special Karakuchi;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);An adjunct (rice & corn starch) laden macro swill. The only reason I didn�t pour it out was that it is cold and it was so damned hot on Okinawa!
Patagonia Bock;Valdivia, Chile;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cervecer�a Kunstmann;Dark brown color with a thin off white head. The nose has some nice chocolately prune notes with a touch whiskey. Light body with some chocolately flavours and a mild sour finiish. Not bad and definetely better than their P.A. and a good beer that is avialable at a convience store
Patagonia Bock;Valdivia, Chile;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Cervecer�a Kunstmann;Dark Brown with Ruby tints. Sweet malt scent with some vinous tones. A mild prune flavor. Not a bad brew, a cut above the run of the mill lagers.

South Shore Bavarian Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;South Shore Brewery;Draft. Hazed golden pour. Lemony but sweet banana lower body. Okay hefeweiEn.
South Shore Bavarian Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;South Shore Brewery;Draught at the brewpub in Ashland. Well undercarbonated, like all of the beers I tried on tap at the brewpub today. Much more of an American wheat in that it is lacking flavor and aroma common to a German hefeweizen, and it was served with a slice of orange, leaving an overwhelming citrus flavor. I really don�t care for the lightness at all.
South Shore Bavarian Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;South Shore Brewery;On tap - pours hazy yellow with white head. Yeasty aroma with spice and caramel. Flavor matches... almost a hefe but stops short. Very good.
South Shore Bavarian Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;South Shore Brewery;GTMW �08. Poured a hazy yellow color with a white bubbly head. Pleasant aroma of banana bread, yeasty bread dough, subdued clove and light caramel. Medium bodied with delicate sweetness. The flavor was just as much a classic hefe as the aroma. Bananas, a bit of bubble gum, clove, and fresh cereal grain. Very nice beer.
South Shore Bavarian Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;South Shore Brewery;Sampled on draught at the GTMN �08. Pours a hazy golden pale yellow brew with a fast dissolving white head that has some light lacing and a thin white ring. Aroma of tropical fruit, yeast, a touch of banana and cloves. Taste is light to medium bodied, some light carbonation with flavors of multi-grain white bread malt with wheat, some banana esters, cloves, and some citrus zest. Finish has a light profile but has a good balance flavors of multi-grain malt and some bubble-gum aftertaste. Quite similar to the Muskie Capital Bavarian Wheat but not as soft in water texture.
South Shore Bavarian Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;South Shore Brewery;Sampled on draught: poured a clear, golden yellow with a large white head that quickly shrinks away. Aroma is a little grassy, soft lemon and hops on the nose. Barely noticeable spice on the palate, somewhat yeasty- pear, golden delicious apple and bubblegum flavors.
South Shore Bavarian Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;South Shore Brewery;"Draught sample at the brewpub, late July 2006. Hmm, maybe this should get a ""1"" for appearance as it�s barely translucent, let alone opaque, though the gold color is proper and the dollop of foam does last a bit....nice typical hefe nose, thankfully, fruit dominating the clove-gingery spice....rather thin and watery on the tongue alas, though the sugary banana-bread character isn�t bad....somewhat grapy/vinous towards the finish...a mixed bag."
South Shore Bavarian Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;South Shore Brewery;Pale golden, no head. Aroma of crisp hexane and esters, with a back of light wheat. Flavor is a typical clear wheat with lemon, clove and more esters. Respectable. Finish is clean and bright. Palate quite sugary, with a little grain. Not a lot of depth overall.
South Shore Bavarian Wheat;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;South Shore Brewery;"On-tap at the brewpub: Cloudy straw, lemon juice yellow, finger high, firm, puffy white cap, minimal lacing sticks. Smell has some dulled lemon, not as spritzy as some hefes, has banana juices, solid wheat tones and some clove and yeast spice hints. Taste comes through as what the smell brings out, mild flavors, very dulled lemon, much more banana flavors showing through, doesn�t withstand much length; flattened finish. Feel is smooth, easy and creamy, shy medium body, dullish mild flavors and carbonation makes this stuff slide right down with ease. Not the best taster for a hefe but makes for a good little drinker. Enjoyable but lacking."
Fitgers Tanked Imperial IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Growler fill... Poured amber/orange with a bubbly head. Nose was Danny, skunky hops/Mary Jane-like. Clean, balanced, citrus, tropical fruits and a bitter finish.
Fitgers Tanked Imperial IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Very murky amber brown pour, with golden orange fringes. Topped with a thin head of extremely creamy rich ivory head. Rich citrus and floral aroma, backed with a deep sweet cream pine and cherry. Aroma very reminiscent of a barleywine. Flavor starts surprsingly watery on the front end. Flavors present themselves on the back end better, with a one-dimensional hop profile and a sweet plum and cherry flavor. Quite rich and creamy. Muhc like an extremely hoppy American Style barley wine, but missing a malt component or two. Aftertaste is a citrus and floral smack of hop sugars. Probably not as hoppy as most hop-heads would like, but is pretty good.
Fitgers Tanked Imperial IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fitgers Brewhouse;2004 GTM. Amateurish aroma. Cloudy light brown. Large bubble light brown head. No lace. Hoppy flavor, some alcohol. Somewhat unrefined. Served a little warm, in keeping with its cask ness. I had heard some good things about this brew, and perhaps it was that it was up against very stiff competition, but I ended up being underwhelmed.
Fitgers Tanked Imperial IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Sampled this beer at the Great Taste of the Midwest in Madison WI. Even though my scores on this are accurate and well researched, Da Man wants me to say more about the beer, so I will. What a beautiful aroma. Taste is somewhat disapointing, but not bad
Fitgers Tanked Imperial IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Growler.Damn, this really took me by surprise.copper in color with just a dash of foam.Beautiful looking brew.Aroma was not unlike Stone Ruination IPA,BIG hoppy grapefruit.I caught myself with my nose in the glass between every sip.Strong hop and citrus flavor,the kind that would turn a non-IPA drinker off completely.But I dug the sh*t out of this.And the flavor stays with you after your done drinking this.I like that.
Fitgers Tanked Imperial IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fitgers Brewhouse;2004 Great Taste of the Midwest. Off-white creamy head, orange-red mostly clear body. Light citrus aroma. Grapefruit rind bitterness throughout with some caramelly sweetness and some fruit.

Fitgers Tanked Imperial IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fitgers Brewhouse;"On-tap at the brewpub: Hazy caramel orange color, thin off-white head keeps a good foamed bubbly skim; super fine lacing in intricately woven yet thick sheeting. Aroma has a big bubble gum presence with mixing sugar coated melon sweetness and juicy, resinous piney backed hops. A slight backing of toasty caramel keeps a nice sweet tone distinguised among the fruits and sugars. Taste has a welcoming mild front of melon, quickly sugar coated, mellow for a good while with hop pine juices. Great toasty malt factions grabbing through from underneath. About 8 seconds later the fun begins where large and lengthy resin filled pine bitterness just rips out the throat and squeezes out any reminents of food or drink before. And it has one hell of an alcoholic hit, wowza! But that late bittering finish is awesome. Hello... hops! Creamy, somewhat buttery medium body, lots of hop kick in the finish, actually a ton of hop kick. Oh, and watch out for that 11.9%, that sneaks up on ya right quick. This is a bigtime biggly big Imperial IPA. Wow! I think my head is still swimming. Very nice stuff! Fitger�s won me over with Misty Mtn...now they�ve bowled me over with this."

Fitgers Edmund Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Fitgers Brewhouse;"Bottle shared by ""hannont"". Colour...very dark brown with almost no head. Nose...very Bourbon like with notes of brown sugar and cotton candy barrel dregs. Palate...more of the immense oakiness to start the experience, then layers of Bourbon and turbinado with a smidgen of oxidation ( this is a 2010) that actually adds a nice aspect to the flavour profile. Nicely aged!"
Fitgers Edmund Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Fitgers Brewhouse;From old notes, maybe several years ago, marked as bottle 41/70 - My notes are very limited on this one. I think it may have been from the tail end of a RBSG grand tasting. Black pour. Thick, full body. Dominate flavors are bourbon and chocolate. It�s very good and goes down smooth.

Fitgers Edmund Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Fitgers Brewhouse;750mL bottle, pours jet black with a small brown head. Aroma is very strong, full of liqueur, vanilla, a little bourbon and red wine. Flavour tastes like a mix of bourbon barrels and red wine barrels, despite the absence of the latter, with secondary notes of chocolate, dark fruits, and liqueur. Quite unusual mix of flavours - certainly not a typical imperial stout, with the vinous notes. Finishes on the vinous notes, with subtle dry tartness. Must be infected, but it somehow works okay. Excellent off-kilter barrel ages impie.

Zerodegrees Wheatbeer Mango;Blackheath, Greater London, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zerodegrees Microbrewery;[On tap at ZeroDegrees Reading] You can still taste ZeroDegrees� rather nice light, refreshing wheat beer at the back of this. However, someones dumped a load of cheap, sickly-sweet tropical fruit (not specifically mango) kids� fruit juice in it. Oddly, the citrus flavour of the wheat beer seems to have become more pronounced though. Nasty, sticky finish. A bit of a mess really.

Blah blah blah blah blah, how people can write so much tosh after drinking half a pint leaves me staggered. I presume that's the same state they must be in to write such flowery nonsense ""tastes like twigs""?? When was the last time you ate or drank a twig? I must have been unfortunate as my pint wasn't laced with hallucinogenics and I missed the woodland flavour. I thought it tasted like a pretty decent pint and the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter agreed with me, the dormouse slept through it all. One pill makes you smaller. Baby."

Mid- to dark gold, clear with a small film of white head and lots of lacing. Grassy smell, some caramel, a bit of a metallic edge. Bitter as hell taste with a vegetal note mid-sip.

Falstaff A Fist Full Of Hops;Derby, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Falstaff Brewery;Aroma light citrus. Pours pale orange golden body with white lace top.

Titanic New World;Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Titanic Brewery (UK);Cask conditioned handpump Rutland & Derby Leicester 13/06/13. An amber brown coloured beer with a bright tight white head and lace. There�s a real sugary sweetness amongst the obvious high level of hopping which doesn�t work.

Buckhead Hefe Double Maibock;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Being overwhelmed by all the fantastic beer being passed around at the �04 GA Gathering I sat there staring at this growler like a blithering idiot for well over an hour. Finally aracauna walked over and told me to try the beer. Well as I wiped off the drool, that was mainly caused by my constant staring at the Dark Lord bottle uncapped 2 feet in front me, I finally sampled the beer. I�m glad he told me to try it! An orange appearance with a minimal head. A nice yeasty and citrusy flavor. The finish was slightly hoppy. A very interesting twist on a dopplebock being so sweet and citrusy. Regardless of classification this was a very nice brew.
Buckhead Hefe Double Maibock;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Growler Sample, Atlanta gathering 2004. Cloudy Orange, no head. Spicy, bready aroma.

Buckhead Hefe Double Maibock;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Thanks to Aracauna for sharing this! Sampled from a growler at the Georgia 14% gathering. Deep amber beer with minimal head. Heavy malt aroma that repeats in the flavor with alcohol added. Needs to hide the alcohol more to be world class, but a great new start for Georgia�s brewers under the new laws and that�s what this tasting was all about!
Buckhead Hefe Double Maibock;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Fairly weak aroma, caramel and alcohol is basically all I get. Bright orange body. Heavily sweet flavor becomes a heavily sweet finish. Medium-full body, creamy texture, average carbonation. The bottom line is: simple but quaffable.
Buckhead Hefe Double Maibock;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Pours a very hazy deep light brown, almost borderlining on orange. With a nice fluffy sticky head. The aroma matches the flavor, full of doughy, dare I say chewy malty goodness. I would drink this again. Thanks to Aracauna for bringing the growler!
Buckhead Hefe Double Maibock;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);4 oz. from a growler, provided by the brewery for the Georgia 14% gathering. To say that this beer is unfiltered is an understatement. This cloudy bronze brew hints of sweetness in the nose, and delivers sweetness in droves throughout. The flavor is big - but not all that complex - strong wheat. Certain beers drink like a meal - this is one of them. It is gritty - almost chewy. As an experiment, this is worth a try for the sheer novelty. The lack of balance makes this a one time thrill.
Buckhead Hefe Double Maibock;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Cloudy amber heavy on the orange with a dense, wet and sticky white head. Apricots, biscuits make up the aroma with a slight tickle of alcohol. The Flavor is bright and peppery with alcohol, which balances the sticky malt nicely. Alcohol is readily apparent in this, but instead of sticking out like a sore thumb, it�s integrated nicely into the flavor and seems to fit. Very sticky beer, but it�s not cloying.
Buckhead Hefe Double Maibock;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);The appearance is pale but very dense and cloudy looking. Almost no head to speak of as delivered by the bartender. This forbiding looking concoction is the way Buckhead Brewery and Grill is welcoming the date on which HB645, legalizing beers stronger than 6% ABV is in effect in Georgia. The smell is very sweetly phenolic with a clearly high alcohol tinge. The taste is sweet and creamy with a alcohol burn down the throat. Definately a sipping beer that complimented a cheesecake quite well. Hope this one is a keeper for them.
Mighty Oak Mad Dogs and Englishmen;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask@Dartford BF. Dry and green, really bland, grainy and edgy, really bad in fact, even fresh, it would be hard to see this improving too much.
Mighty Oak Mad Dogs and Englishmen;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Beer #21 at Dartford Beer Festival with ST and Duff. Welcome to butterscotch city. One of a number of beers at the festival that were ruined by excessive diacetyl. Whilst I was aware of daicetyl, I had never experienced such a dramatic effect before. This sparked a lively debate about the causes and effects of diacetyl, what effect cold conditions might have and, most of all, how to pronounce the word. As well as the butterscotch, this beer was also marred by undeveloped malt and a tinny aftertaste, all down to poor conditioning. I have marked up a bit to refelect that and will re-rate if I get the opportunity. A shame, because this brewery usually produces very good beers. Cask (gravity dispense).
Mighty Oak Mad Dogs and Englishmen;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Dartford Fest. Gravity. Diacetyl madness! Huge butterscotch aroma which is repeated in a thick cloggy rancid manner in the flavour. This was a start of a period of diacetyl beers. The tent was cold. The past few days have been cold and damp. Same conditions as applied at the Reading Fest when I encountered the same thing - loads of diacetyl beers.

Millis Dartford Wobbler;Dartford, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dartford Wobbler (prev Millis Brewery);Beer #22 at Dartford Beer Festival with SilkTork and Duff. A bit of a twitchers� pun in the name of this one - a Dartford Warbler is a small bird that nearly became extinct in the UK, but has now recovered somewhat, although it is not found anywhere near Dartford. The beer was a dark copper colour. Mainly malty, with some bitterness, but nothing that exciting. A traditional style best bitter. Cask (gravity dispense).

We played a few games of bar billiards and watched the traffic on the river while tucking into a tasty omelette and chips. A good evening. The beer went down nice. Much better than on my previous visit the other day when I felt it was a bit vague and tired. On this occasion it slipped down smooth, and tasted fuller than a 4.3% [3.2]
Ventnor Pistol Nights;Ventnor, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ventnor Brewery;Cask (backlog). Golden colour with a small white head. Aroma is biscuity malts, some floral and grassy notes along with mild grains. Flavour is biscuity and bready malts with some floral, grassy and earthy notes to it.
Ventnor Pistol Nights;Ventnor, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ventnor Brewery;A Mes rate: cask at the Market Porter. Hazy gold with a thin white head and very good condition. Fruity hop aroma with some good earthy malt and hints of barley. Similar flavour but let down just a little by a hint of plastic. Nice peaty, almost smoky finish. Good stuff other than the plastic.
Ventnor Pistol Nights;Ventnor, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ventnor Brewery;Cask gravity at Planet Thanet BF 08. Gold with thin bubbly head. I wasn�t expecting much as not a fan of this brewery�s past beers. But this has decent flowery hop and peach/apricot fruit. OK bitter with decent fruit.
Ventnor Pistol Nights;Ventnor, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ventnor Brewery;Cask. A golden ale style of bitter, IMHO. Light crisp citrusy - lemon - hops. Thin but very pleasant body, mostly a sweet malt citrus hop combo. Really hit the spot.
Ventnor Pistol Nights;Ventnor, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ventnor Brewery;Cask, Jersey Fest 06. Orange/gold with a small head. Aromas are sweet pine hops with sweet caramel and honey notes. Mellow citrus with floral aspects. Flavours are sweet, sugary, light malts with dry, pine hops. Lightly fruity with a soft and buttery palate.
Ventnor Pistol Nights;Ventnor, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ventnor Brewery;Cask conditioned @ Plough Inn, Tiptoe (new forest). Light with citrussy hops. Quite dry but not a lot of hops in the finish to accentuate this. Drinkable but not exceptional.

Ventnor Pistol Nights;Ventnor, Isle Of Wight, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ventnor Brewery;Cask@Dartford BF. Very, very thin and boring. Slight sulfur and boiled egg in the aroma, grainy texture, not impressed at all.

Scharer's Seven Chakras;Picton, N.S.W., Australia;Bock - Doppelbock;Scharer's Little Brewery;Bottle (750ml). Poured dark burnt copper with an averaged sized, dense, frothy, caramel (light) colored head which lasted well. Aroma was complex with rich malts, dark stewed fruits, dried apricots, ginger fudge, dried cranberries, hints of allspice and some light yeasty notes in the back. Flavor was a good hop bitterness with rich toffee malts, figs, prunes, preserved plums, caramelized dates, white pepper, nutty fruit cake, a touch of ginger root and a very dry resinous/sappy finish. Medium bodied with soft carbonation, a dry/resinous mouthfeel and a great finish. Purchased from the George IV Inn Picton � 3 750ml bottles for $25.50
Scharer's Seven Chakras;Picton, N.S.W., Australia;Bock - Doppelbock;Scharer's Little Brewery;Cloudy dark straw colour with big fluffy head. Big alcohol aroma. Warm outh feel due to high abv. but trying too hard and pulled nothing flash.
Scharer's Seven Chakras;Picton, N.S.W., Australia;Bock - Doppelbock;Scharer's Little Brewery;Dark golden colour with a floral aroma. Fairly full taste with the alcohol carefullly hidden, harsh aftertaste of the floral hops. The one 750ml went down easily enough but the one was probably enough.
Scharer's Seven Chakras;Picton, N.S.W., Australia;Bock - Doppelbock;Scharer's Little Brewery;NFOB 2004 (Listed as Scharers Super Strong) Hard to pigeon hole this stuff. Poured a cloudy orange with a small head that exibited some lacing. Fruity malty nose with a few other less desirable veggy notes. Quite sweet but seemed oddly thin in texture although the alcohol wasn�t too evident except in the finish. A bit of work, maybe a different yeast, and this could be a pretty good abbey (if that is what the aim is to be).
Scharer's Seven Chakras;Picton, N.S.W., Australia;Bock - Doppelbock;Scharer's Little Brewery;Bottle brought to Melbourne by my sister. Wow - looks like the standard deviation on this beer is about to go up! This beer is bloody sweet, but I actually really liked it. Pours a hazy dark orange colour with not much head and frankly it doesn�t look real good. The label looks pretty amateurish too (especially compared to Burragorang Bock�s label) but it does have nudity on it, so that�s good. Aroma of diacetyl jumps out initially, but melds in with other stuff quickly. Honey, toasted sugar and caramel popcorn aromas without any of the fruit and vegetable stuff that was so prominent in the original 7.77. Flavour is dominated by a really fat, thick, candy-like sweetness. I probably don�t know enough about brewing to make this call with any certainty but it seems like they mashed VERY high on this one, as it�s not an unfermented kind of sweetness. There�s also a toasted sugar type flavour, with an orangey bitterness fighting its way in the middle and then getting overwhelmed by the sweetness again. Nice, smooth, warming alcohol in the finish. I often complain about beers that are overly sweet - and this is certainly sweet - but it�s just so fresh and good that I don�t care. Maybe the other raters got bad bottles, or this is a different batch, but this is no drain pour. I�m really tempted to cellar some of this actually, though I know Scharer�s strongly discourages this.
Scharer's Seven Chakras;Picton, N.S.W., Australia;Bock - Doppelbock;Scharer's Little Brewery;Bottle: This is not a Dopplebock. Poured cloudy dark gold with a large creamy white head. The nose is quite obviously �Belgian� with plenty of cloves and sweet fake banana. Also quite herbaceous at times with some noticable smokey malts and, bizarrely, some mago-like fruit. Flavour is not good. It reminded me of Triple Karmelite, though nowhere near as refined. Sweet, but not overly so, with some hop-herb and lacking any real malt profile. Harsh. Palate was its real downfall - very hash from beginning to end. Aside from that the mouthfeel was quite smooth and silky with low carbonation. Overall, a very unbalanced and lost beer that, if developed by the brewers, will have some potential. I would say this is a Triple or a Belgian Strong Ale. As an afterthought. When the bottle was left open for 1/2 an hour the harshness subsided somewhat. Perhaps this is a beer to age??
Scharer's Seven Chakras;Picton, N.S.W., Australia;Bock - Doppelbock;Scharer's Little Brewery;"D R a i n p O u R. what a disappointment. I honestly have no idea what style of beer this is intended to be. They say it�s a doppelbock in the commercial description up there, but then in the paper Laurie Strachan I think it was said it was meant to be a ""trappist"" style beer. Well, to me it tastes like Duvel made with peated malt. ODD. hazy yellow orange, with a loose fluffy white head. Smells like spicy duvel yeast, with extra phenolics, but not a lot of smell really. Then the taste is just foul. Sweet grainy malt rapidly overtaken by a disgusting burnt rubber phenolic flavour, that becomes even more disgusting when it clashes with the astringent bitterness. Something has gone very very wrong here."
Scharer's Seven Chakras;Picton, N.S.W., Australia;Bock - Doppelbock;Scharer's Little Brewery;Whose opinion is it that states it is better than the previous version? Presumably the brewer who is wanting to promote this beer. I remember some of the ratings for the 7.77 discussing a cabbagey type of presence. Well this one is the whole minestrone. Vegetables everywhere and not much of the malt thing happening. It starts out well with the colour and presnce in the glass but it goes quickly downhill with a very poor combination of characters that simply fail to integrate for any time at all. Crappy label too.
Waimea Luau Lager;Waimea, Hawaii, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Waimea Brewing Company;Tap at brewery. Sort of a cloudy golden color. Interesting... Biscuity malts with a slight fruitiness in the aroma. Taste is not so great, with the same sort of bitter flavor as all of the other beers excep with absolutely nothing to back it up. Kind of corny as well. I guess it�s a decent pale lager.
Waimea Luau Lager;Waimea, Hawaii, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Waimea Brewing Company;Bottle. A nice surprise! Poured a near hazy, glowing yellow with a massive off-white head and big yeast sediment. Massive lace. Apple sauce, orange peel, flowers, tamarind, Belgian yeast, candi sugar in the nose. ????

Waimea Luau Lager;Waimea, Hawaii, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Waimea Brewing Company;This one resembles too many ales rather than lagers.

Waimea Luau Lager;Waimea, Hawaii, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Waimea Brewing Company;This beer came to me from my beer club - I have never heard of this brewer before.

Waimea Luau Lager;Waimea, Hawaii, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Waimea Brewing Company;"Bottle from Aubrey. Beer is clear, light bright gold with a large, white, fuzzy-looking, mostly diminishing head. The aroma is the best I�ve smelled in this style so far. it�s malty with light notes of toasted grain, caramel, trace of cracker; Hoppy with light lemon zest, light resin/pine, flower; Yeasty with a trace of blue-veined cheese, light note of dough; Miscellaneous notes of moderate bubble gummy tropical fruit, trace of butterscotch.The flavor is lightly sweet, moderately bitter with a longer-than-average lightly bitter, trace unclean finish. The body is light, the texture is watery and the carbonation is lively. I think this is my favorite PL so far."

Thirsty Dog Anniversary DUIPA;Akron, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Draft a brewpub in Dayton. Introduced as a Double IPA. Dark amber color with a medium head that diminished slowly. Good strong hop and citrus aroma. Medium body. Full well balanced flavor of hops and sweet with a solid bitter finish.
Thirsty Dog Anniversary DUIPA;Akron, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Draft-brewey. Deep amber/red color. Decent aroma, but something that Ican�t quite describe with the flavor other than to say that it just isn�t quite right. I don�t know what it is with Thirsty Dog, but there is something with the flavor of almost all of their beers that just doesn�t agree with me. I love Double IPAs, this is/was(they have recently sold all of their brewing equipment) my local brewery, and I really wanted to like this, but it is simply mediocre.
Thirsty Dog Anniversary DUIPA;Akron, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Hazy red copper ale. Smells like a hoppy orange uice, with earthy notes. Hops and sweet candy with very harsh bitterness. Very dry but still well balanced. (Sept. 2004)
Thirsty Dog Anniversary DUIPA;Akron, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Bottled by hopsrus, thanks! Cloudy copper colour, rich head. Extreme flowery hop aroma. Sweet, richly malty and tremendously hoppy. Traces of plums, fairly soft mouthfeel.
Thirsty Dog Anniversary DUIPA;Akron, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;On tap from the source: Strong strawberry-kiwi aroma. Dark malts with little fizzle (my nizzle) or head. Mellow hops. First sip was w/o sweetness and quite bitter, but further imbibing revealed a nice light sweetness that well complements the hops. The hops are strong but not acrid. Complex, pleasing, fun and delicious. Very dark brown with maple shallows. Spruce/fir hops that linger for 10 seconds on the palate then eases to mellowness. Smells like apple tainted weed.
Thirsty Dog Anniversary DUIPA;Akron, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;"Herbal, citrus, resin, pine with a little toasty malt in the aroma. Good balance malt, hop flavor, and acidity. Good sweetness. Hop flavor is less distinctly discernable of each component in the flavor than in the aroma but is strong. More bitter and a stronger acidity than most double IPAs. The malt should be more of a blanket for the hops to rest upon. A lower acidity would help to intensify the hop flavor rather than wash it away. That said, it is more drinkable than most double IPAs (""Danger Will Robinson, Danger""). The acidity leads to a �cleaner� finish and a grapefruit pith is omnipresent in an extoadinarily long finish."
Thirsty Dog Anniversary DUIPA;Akron, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Breathing through an orange pulp mask...Frail fruity sweetness manages to seep through the orangey, resinous hops and argues that a diversity really lives within...An earthy malt biscuit oversees the last half until a momentous hop bitterness topples it...The baccate innuendos underneath help increase the complexity but would need help to bring this one to the forefront of the big boys� class of excellence...
Thirsty Dog Anniversary DUIPA;Akron, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Hazy copper body has a big bubbles crown. Weird fruity nose seems a bit uni-dimensional. Orange zest, grapes or berries flavors. It doesn�t appear so hoppy until you take a sip. Actually, this is a beer to be enjoyed in the finish which is long, earthy, grapefruity and memorably long. Otherwise, palate has some interesting refreshing fruit acids interplays, but not so much to talk about in terms of maltiness. medium body, nice mellow carbonation.
Thirsty Dog Anniversary DUIPA;Akron, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Earth, orange, pine in the hoppy nose. Orange definitely dominates the aroma. Orange-brown coloured body with cover of thin white head that lasts nicely. Biscuit malt flavour with strong notes of earthy, orange hops. Very aggressive bitterness comes to the fore in the long, dry finish. Body is medium-light, mouthfeel a touch thin and carbonation low, but it goes down very well. Bottle enjoyed with beerbuzzmontreal, lubiere, MartinT and Rastacouere. Thanks hopsrus!
Thirsty Dog Anniversary DUIPA;Akron, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Dark amber color with a thin head. Aroma of orange pulp, earthy yeast and maybe hops.

La Jolla Brewhouse IPA;La Jolla, California, United States;IPA;La Jolla Brewhouse;Draft at the brewpub. Nose of lots of citrus and some pine. Clear orange with a medium off white head. Flavor is bitterness, pine, and a little caramel maltiness.
La Jolla Brewhouse IPA;La Jolla, California, United States;IPA;La Jolla Brewhouse;On draft at La Jolla Brewhouse (La Jolla, CA): Pours a slightly hazed golden yellow, white one-finger head, thick lacing circles around the rim. Nose of white grapefruit off the bat, some green apple pulp, a blend of orange juice/peel, baby pine, and florals. Extremely carbonated, sticky mouthfeel, and spicy towards the finish. There�s a light malt backing to it, but unfortunately just doesn�t balance with the extreme grapefruit bitterness felt throughout. Not as tropical fruity as the nose lets on. Drinkability: A bit of a let down. Pairing: Turkey bacon avocado cheese sandwich. Side of caesar salad. Rebuy: No. #379 on 05042010, DG.
La Jolla Brewhouse IPA;La Jolla, California, United States;IPA;La Jolla Brewhouse;Draft at the brewhouse. Pours a weird musty golden brown with a small white ring. Nose was fruity with some faint hops. Flavor was reminicent of a hefe, very un ipa like, slightly bitter finish, pretty bad.

Faint aroma of floral hops and not much else discernable. Sweet toasty and caramel maltiness with a balancing hoppiness, floral and herbal, a touch of tart green apple with a mildly spicy finish.

La Jolla Brewhouse IPA;La Jolla, California, United States;IPA;La Jolla Brewhouse;Draught at the Brewpub: Bronze color, nose of grassy citrusy hops. Flavor is pale and light in itterness, thin body. A decent all around IPA. Hoppy enough to be called San Diegan, but just comes across average because it barely makes the cut.
La Jolla Brewhouse IPA;La Jolla, California, United States;IPA;La Jolla Brewhouse;"(Draft: Beach House Brewery in La Jolla, CA) One of the better beers at Beach House, this IPA is totally dominated from start to finish by grapefruit hoppiness; It�s a moderately sweet beer, but because of the dominating grapefruit, you don�t really notice it until the hops beats on your tongue for awhile; Very piney nose is quite nice; Medium bodied with a crisp, clean palate; Dark golden in color; Headless pour, but with a mild sheen on top, like an oil slick"

Draught House Schadenfreude;Austin, Texas, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Apparently the name for this one means something like: Making fun of the misfortuned or having a laugh at the expense of those who suck. That said the beer tastes as rude as the name. Awful. Disgusting even. The worst smoked lager I�ve ever encountered. Looks like poowater. Literally. Take a poop. Leave it overnight. Come back and you will have what this brew looks like. Mouthfeel is not awful but nothing can really help this guy out. It literally feels like you are chewing on smoked aniseeds. AWFUL!!!!

Colour of pink grapefruit juice. Soapy, raspberry wheaty aroma. Lots of yeastiness as well. Flavour is also yeasty, with a strong raspberry presence. Some wet cardboard flavour too.

Served from draught with a minimal, soapy head. Nose of butterscotch, banana, and toasty, nutty malts. Rich buttery, nutty flavor with a flurry of woody hops in the finish. Decent body. A very hoppy bock, not that I mind. Although I�m not a fan of maibocks, this is a decent one from TMBC.
Landmark India Red Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Horse Brewing Company;Caramel, faded hops, standard hoppy amber but not super enjoyable. Thanks to ? for the bottle.
Landmark India Red Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Horse Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Pours deep golden red with a thick off white head. Aroma is slightly citric, mostly pine and floral with grassy notes and a strong caramel and biscuit maltiness. Flavor starts with a pine and light citrus but quickly gets overwhelmed by a soapy and slightly metallic note. gotten pretty gross, looking at the dates of other ratings this bottle must be ages old. Yikes
Landmark India Red Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Horse Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle. The label reads this was brewed by the Paper City Brewery in Holyoke, MA. I did not realize this beer is retired when I bought it, there is no dating on the bottle. When I opened the beer, foam oozed out of the bottle continuously and made a mess on my counter. Pours slightly hazed amber with a moderate-large sudsy tan head that is fed by lots of bubbles rising in the beer. The aroma is dusty malt with a trace amount of piney hops. The flavor is a decent dose of malt up front followed by some moderate bitterness that is for the most part flavorless. Prickly mouthfeel due to the high carbonation.
Landmark India Red Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Horse Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours slightly hazy and red with a medium tan head. Aromas of citrus peel and sweet grass with some caramel. The flavor is bitter grass and rotting raisin and apple peel. Very high carbonation and dry. This was a tough one to get through, certainly not an easy drinker. Not good. This may just be an old bottle, as I see it�s retired. I hope they don�t make this anymore. [618]
Landmark India Red Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Horse Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a clear amber with a faint, white head. Citrtus hop and caramel malt aroma. Lightly sweet with some earthy, dirty bitterness. Medium in body with average carbonation. Finishes with some mild sour notes and lingering bitters. Could be a bit old.
Landmark India Red Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Horse Brewing Company;Bottle says this is brewed at Paper City Brewing in Holyoke, MA, so it seems like maybe they started making this again. Anyway, I got it at the American Beer Distributors for a super cheap $7 a six-pack. Pours a really nice looking creamy white head that lasts for quite a while. Aroma is not that powerful, but the malty side shines through. Hops are there, but not in force. Really has an Irish Red feel to it, but with tangy hops biting at the tongue. Slightly roasted malts. I would say this is more malty than hoppy. The finish is the hoppiest part I would say. Tastes like a really good amber ale like Prohibition or Hopback. Definitely newly brewed and not skunked.
Landmark India Red Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Horse Brewing Company;"Nice deep ruby coloured body with strong brown tints and a fast-dying tan head. Aroma of super fresh hops, nice tart fruit, potent malt and even a tad of nuttiness. Medium to Full-bodied; Strong hoppy flavour up front that fades into maltiness and leaves a bit of the nuts on the palate. Aftertaste is quick and mild, nothing going on really. Overall, nothing more than a dry-hopped amber or red ale that doesn�t do much for anyone. This one should be overlooked unless you really want a crummy beer from Syracuse. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Oliver�s Beverage in Albany, New York on 31-December-2005 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia."

Fairly true to style, just not all that exciting.

Great Dane HopScotch Adopt-A-Family Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at Great Dane Fitchburg as Hopscotch. Clear dark caramel brown with a creamy tan head. Aroma of toffee, malt, light pine& citrus and grains. Solid taste of pine, toffee, nuts, toasted malt, some citrus and floral hops along with a minimal chocolate malt presence. Moderate bitterness, nicely balanced and easily the winner on this trip to the Great Dane.
Great Dane HopScotch Adopt-A-Family Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;I enjoyed this one a lot. What a great idea... something between a Scotch ale and a pale ale. Delicious hop flavor with a peatiness as well? All right!
Great Dane HopScotch Adopt-A-Family Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at Fitchburg location. Dark amber/brown. Good citrusy/floral hop aroma. Taste is caramel and roast malts with typical bitterness for a Scotch Ale. Good hybrid between Pale and Scotch Ale. Most have been some good dry-hopping going on.
Great Dane HopScotch Adopt-A-Family Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Clear medium brown with a significant creamy beige head, leaves a good lace. Light sweet floral hops aroma, with a bit of cream soda in there, too. Flavor is a fairly simple pairing of caramel and floral hops. Hops bitterness subdued, really just offsetting an otherwise sweetish beer. The first few sips had a carbonic sharpness that paired poorly with the rest of the beer, this faded. Medium body, smooth palate.
Great Dane HopScotch Adopt-A-Family Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;I am truly sorry Dane, but this is the most dissapointed and dejected I have ever felt in my entire life. This beer made me want to go next door to Club Majestic and jump off the balcony headfirst while the worst music known to man bumped through the PA.
Great Dane HopScotch Adopt-A-Family Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;(Fitchburg) Copper color with a rolling off white head. Interesting dark rich caramel with heavy hops influence (mild pine and citrus). Light peat and heavier caramel flavors overtaken by floral and licorice hops bite. Things don�t seem to meld for me. Hops distract too much. Finish of licorice and caramel, with a touch to much licorice for my tastes.
Great Dane HopScotch Adopt-A-Family Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;This beer seems to be a cross between a scottish ale and an APA/IPA. It is a medium to dark brown, slightly reddish/copper. The aroma is rather weak, but the taste is quite hoppy. Malt is evident, but not like in a scottish or brown ale. A pale ale-type mouthfeel, although slightly watery. It is a flavorful beer that would be a good addition to the regular menu.
Momokawa Nama Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Namasak�;SakeOne Corporation;Draft at SakeOne on 12/21/11. Aroma is crisp floral perfume with subtle fiji apples. Pours clear with gorgeous legs. Flavor is strongly reminiscent of rose and sweet rice. Subtle cinnamon and sweet coconut. The palate is silken and velvety. Sweet and effervescent.

Moonstone Peach Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;"The body is clear with a slight yellow tint. It smells of fresh peaches with a very light grassiness.

Moonstone Peach Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Bottle chilled. Poured a clear pale color. Moderate peach tart apple and alcohol aroma. Light to medium body with a smooth dry texture. Medium sweet peach flavor with a medium sweet green apple finish of moderate duration. This sake goes well with a good cigar.
Moonstone Peach Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Served chilled in a little ceramic guinomi, Virago, Nashville TN. Not bad. I feel, in a way, like a girl who says they like beer because they had a Woodchuck Cider once, or a Smirnov Ice or some such drink. I liked this, but is this legitimate sake? Anyway, it was better than the unfiltered stuff I had before it. Mostly clear and pale in color (it was dark in the trendy little sushi bar, so I can�t comment on shade). Smells were vague, but peachish with milder fruitiness as well (pears, maybe? very bland apples?) Sweet all the way through like a dessert beer, I couldn�t notice the alcohol at all and the peach definitely predominated. The nature of the peach flavor was a bit synthetic (like schnapps), but the sweetness was restrained so that it was not at all cloying. A touch of dryness at the end. It was very light and crisp, smooth, soft. My mom would like this. I like it too.
Moonstone Peach Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Ichiban Restaurant, Baton Rouge, La. - cold - pours from the ceramic decanter clear with a glinty sheen, like vodka. Aroma is peachy of course, but quite pleasant and subtly sweet. Flavor has elements of peach mingled with the rice. Not overly fruity, more of an afterthought. Alcohol is warm and cozy and sits well with the meal. Very creamy mouthfeel. Nice change of pace.
Moonstone Peach Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Sak� - Infused;SakeOne Corporation;Clear, oily body. The impact is light with sweet peach. Aroma is full of peach like fruity schnapps. The flavor is FULL of peach. Dry, semi-sweet finish, balanced tail. Light alcohol but seems like peach schnapps, the peach overpowers any complex subtlty from the Ruby base of this.
Oggis Beat Em Down Brown;San Clemente, California, United States;Brown Ale;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;"(Draft: Oggi�s in Vista, CA) I like this beer more than I thought I would; It has a pleasing, very toasty maltiness early, though it sneaks through later on as well; It is complemented by a moderate bitterness, and the finish is fairly bitter and dark roasted, and that kind of pushes aside the nice toastiness; Despite being very flavorful, the beer has very little nose, perhaps some slightly sweet malty aromas; Medium bodied; Deep brown in color; Rocky, tan head fades to a sheen, but leaves a dense blanket of lacing"

Fortas Stiprusis;Kaunas, Lithuania;Pale Lager - Strong;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);Golden yellow colour, amll head, slightly oily appearance. Malty and very sweet with alcohol
Fortas Stiprusis;Kaunas, Lithuania;Pale Lager - Strong;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);"500ml, tall and elegant brown bottle with two dates on it: 01.07.11 and 28.12.11, hope I�m not about to open an old lager! This is a live tasting on 1st March 2013. The bottle was bought in a random shop along-side Walthamstow (London) Market two weekends ago. The beer was poured into an Abbot Ale glass tankard and it looks cloudy, it wasn�t half way through the pour, it became misty as I emptied the contents fully into the glass. Old gold with an issue is what I ended up with, the white fluffy head soon became disinterested and turned into a wispy island or two with a collar around the tankards rim. The smell (at first) was like a German Wiessbier: I detected bananas and vanilla within the sweet aromas hitting my nose; tropical fruit esters followed, mango and pineapple for instance. The taste is very fruity, those tropical fruits appearing in the flavour as I drink the beer. The alcohol giving the fruits an extra bounce, strength and sweetness. It is almost like a fruit punch or cocktail in depth of flavour and body: I�m impressed. No idea if my bottle is 2 years out of date: but if it is, it has allowed the beer to mature into a weird and wonderful concoction of flavours that I�d love to taste again. My sweet tooth has really, really enjoyed this."
Fortas Stiprusis;Kaunas, Lithuania;Pale Lager - Strong;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);Bottle, from an ethnic food store in Scunthorpe. Gold, fluffy but thin white head and gentle condition.

Fortas Stiprusis;Kaunas, Lithuania;Pale Lager - Strong;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);500ml bottle (Iki, Vilnius) Pale gold, brief head. Bland aroma - some hint of sweet maltiness and a touch of fruity perfume, but that�s all. Soft sweet palate, loads of retronasal esters. Swirling it around in the mouth you�ll get a bit of alcohol too, but you have to force it out. Simple strong lager malty body, a touch fruity and vinous, a touch of vanilla or other sweet softening element. Almond too. Gently, but noticably hopped - a touch grassy or hayey. Very drinkable. Not falling-over-juice for those who don�t care what they drink by any means. Dagnamit - I actually enjoyed this lager!
Fortas Stiprusis;Kaunas, Lithuania;Pale Lager - Strong;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);Bottle, 8.1%. Fruity aroma, hint of urine and pepper. Clear golden colour, stable white head.

Fortas Stipriausias;Kaunas, Lithuania;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);Bottle, from an ethnic food shop in Scunthorpe. Gold, thin but sustained white head and good condition. Soft sweet gentle grainy malt in the nose with some background peppery spiciness and a muted earthy woody fungal note that reminded me of Greifenklau in Bamberg. Full sweet graininess in the mouth with a gentle background hop bitterness and a building spiciness that has suggestions of herbs and marzipan, almost like a watered down Drambuie, a warming alcohol lurks in the background before rushing back retronasaly in the finish which is tinged with more honeyed floral sweetness and a peppery bitterness. Very enjoyable and dangerously drinkable, it reminded me of many lost evenings drinking bocks in Bamberg.

Three B's Shuttle Ale;Darwen, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Three B's Brewery;[Cask at the Back of Beyond (JDW), Reading] Amber, moderate white head. Sweet, honey-like taste from the off with a caramel and fruit background. Hints of spice come through, but it needs more hops to balance the sweetness. Below par.
Three B's Shuttle Ale;Darwen, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Three B's Brewery;Cask @ Society Room, JDW. Amber colour, off-white head. Aroma is malty and fruity. Flavour of light roasted malts, caramel, fruits. Medium bodied, still soft and drinkable. Quite ok.

Three B's Shuttle Ale;Darwen, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Three B's Brewery;Cask gravity at White Cliffs BF 09. Bit of a haze on a copper/russet body. Thin beige head. Still in pretty good nick, ratehr good fruit/malt. Some earthy hop finish. It�s pretty good. Nice bit of sparkle and very decent fruit.
Three B's Tackler's Tipple;Darwen, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Three B's Brewery;9/11/2018. Cask at the 24th Watford Beer Festival. Pours clear dark amber with a bubbly off-white head. Aroma of malt, hops, fruit, biscuit and toffee. Moderate sweetness and medium plus bitterness. Medium body, oily texture, soft carbonation. bitter, fruity finish.
Three B's Tackler's Tipple;Darwen, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Three B's Brewery;Clitheroe Beer Festival 2016. Clear copper coloured ale. Mildly sweetened bitter with a smoothness in its texture.
Three B's Tackler's Tipple;Darwen, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Three B's Brewery;Scotland: JDW Beer fest. A very forgettable brew sadly. Not worth the coinage.
Three B's Tackler's Tipple;Darwen, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Three B's Brewery;Hazy amber with a small off-white head. Malty aroma with honey and a floral note. Dry and fruity flavour with a touch of honey. A bit dusty character
Three B's Tackler's Tipple;Darwen, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Three B's Brewery;Bottle 500ml. @ ChrisOs. [ Vintage BBF 090? ].

Three B's Tackler's Tipple;Darwen, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Three B's Brewery;500ml bottle (ChrisO�s, post RBESG2011 Sunday) Vague sweet aroma. Dry body, but not much flavour. Simple sweet malts, and it�s been aged to dryness. BB Sept 0X for unreadable X. Just about survived the over aging, quite impressive for a weak beer.
Three B's Tackler's Tipple;Darwen, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Three B's Brewery;Bottled, 500ml from Booths, Poulton Lancs. Brown to amber with slight head. Many of the old British bottle conditioning faults show up in this beer, a slight tartness, yeasty, cidery note, thankfully it hasn�t gone too far in this as yet. Darker roasted malt with a slight, dry boiled hop note. Not that pleasant in bottle.
Three B's Tackler's Tipple;Darwen, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Three B's Brewery;Cask-conditioned at the King of Wessex (JDW), Bath 7/05/09. Deep copper with a decent white head. Sweet aroma of red fruits and chocolate malts. Flavour was a bit syrupy to start, before some bitter chocolate and a decent bitter finish came to the rescue. Good stuff.
Three B's Tackler's Tipple;Darwen, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Three B's Brewery;Half from cask at The Wheatsheaf in Stoke. Nitro creamy, off-white head with good laceworks. Dark amber with a slight head. Aroma of bitter fruits and sweet malts. Grapefruit shells in flavour ending up with a nice dry bitter finish. Good version of the style (Wetherspoon real ale festival, 02.05.2009).
Three B's Tackler's Tipple;Darwen, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Three B's Brewery;"Cask at the Old Manor (JDW), Bracknell. Gold with a dense cream head; fruity, malty aroma; lots of orange fruit flavour with a jammy sweetness; clean well-balanced bitter finish."
Flour City 44 Magnum;Rochester, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;"A very bitter IPA. 100 IBU and over 8%ABV. Not a big IPA guy, but 44 is well-balanced. The Hops will ""blow your head clean off."" ""Do you feel lucky?"" Overall, a nice effort."
Flour City 44 Magnum;Rochester, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;Orange in colour with a thin white head. Huge aroma of grapefruit citrus hops hits you pretty hard. The flavour was all citrus hops (grapefruit and oranges mainly), some pine and earthy malt. Medium body and high carbonation. Finishes with a very long intense bitterness. Way to one-dimentional and over the top.
Flour City 44 Magnum;Rochester, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;Tap. Good doublr IPA. Light amber appearance with a thick white head. Strong hoppy, citrus, pine aroma. Flavor was bitter, hoppy. Well balanced crisp hops. Very enjoyable beer for those who like double IPAs, especially from a small brewery.
Flour City 44 Magnum;Rochester, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;Amber Orange w/thin head. Very very hoppy but without balance. Nice grapefruit citrus aroma but far too one-dimensional and sharp in the finish.
Flour City 44 Magnum;Rochester, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;This is a serious quaff monster. It boasts 100 IBUs and ABV 8.1% but it is a balanced brew lover�s dream. Citric hop nose. Nice lacing after the brewpub pour. Lots of malt and juiciness to this hop monster. Only a faint amount of alcohol at the finish. A great brew, indeed.
Flour City 44 Magnum;Rochester, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;Nice green floral hop w. cotton candy nose. Lots of hops in the flavor but they aren�t quite balanced by the malt. Mouthfeel could be heavier.
Flour City 44 Magnum;Rochester, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;2004 draught at the brewery. It was nice to see an Imperial IPA on tap here. This is quoted in the description as 8.1%abv and 100IBU. Pours to a bright, golden/amber color with a good sized white head. Medium to full body, very crisp. Tons of hops in the aroma....surprise, surprise. Lots of bitter citrus, grapefruit, floral notes. The flavor manages to match the smell, punch for punch. Tons of biting, bitter citrus, floral, and pine tastes really show off the hops. As clarkvv and ringo have noted, the hops really taste so fresh here. They have the hops down. Now the malt could use just a bit more backbone and complexity and I think we�d see a real winner here.
Flour City 44 Magnum;Rochester, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;"2004 draught @ the brewpub. Nice to see this style finally being brewed in Rochester. Pours a bright golden, with some light orange hues and a good-sized white head, but not very deep and no red tinges. Aroma is full speed ahead with the hops and the flavor matches the aroma with tons of bitter floral and citrus notes. The first thing I noticed about this beer, and then about the other beers I tried was how fresh the hops taste. In fact, I thought exactly what Ringo said , ""it reminds you of chewing on a hop"". Extremely fresh. Malting is nothing to write home about, as there dosent seem to be much of an attempt at balance, but oh well. It�s a start. Assertive carbonation, medium-to medium-full body."
Flour City 44 Magnum;Rochester, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;100 IBU�s and I tasted every single one of them. With that said, the lack of much of a grapefruit taste was a pleasant surprise. It had a very fresh hop taste, sorta like when you chew on a hop. I do not know what type of hops that they used, but again, they were not overly citrusy. A good thing.
Flour City 44 Magnum;Rochester, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;Slightly hazy yellow-gold. Frothy white head. Moderately hoppy, grapefruit aroma (expected more from an Imperial IPA). Some stickiness, but a little thin. Big hoppy, grapefruit & pine flavour w/ a decently malty (caramel) background (much more in line w/ what I expected). Finish is long & lingers.
Flour City Back Astor Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Flour City Brewing Co.;2004 draught at brewery. Pours to a clear, orange/amber color with a small light tan head. Aroma: light to medium malts, easy citrus, sweet and spicey scents. Flavor: Pretty standard amber ale. Some light malt sweetness starts you off, then a little bit of spice (for an amber at least), then some crisp hops finish it off. Slightly watery, not bad.
Flour City Back Astor Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Flour City Brewing Co.;2004 draught. Pours a light coppery orange with small light beige head. Aroma has some light citrus, brass and grains. Flavor is your typical average high volume micro amber. Some very distant fruit notes from the yeast, very watery and a bit too dry from the malting. Fresh hops overly apparent, which gives me something decent to focus on.
Flour City Back Astor Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Flour City Brewing Co.;Sampled at Empire Brewfest. Slightly sweet malty aroma with a touch of hops in there as well. Transparent amber/copper color with a miniscule head. Malty start, with sweet hints. Some hops kick to bring up the rear. Slightly watery.
Flour City Back Astor Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Flour City Brewing Co.;(Draught) Sampled at the Empire State Brewing Fesitval. Had a quick-dissipating head with a copper body. Nose and flavour were very hoppy and slightly smoked. Average.
Flour City Ruddy Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flour City Brewing Co.;2004 draught at brewery. Light to light-medium bodied, not too bitter, this is a very easygoing beer. There was a lack of a clear aroma, though I did note some mild hops, caramel, and some buttery or almost biscuit notes. The taste is actually very nice, though just a bit mild. It�s very dry, has some good malts that give it some sweet and toasted notes, and enough hops to just barely balance things out. I�d love to taste this beer with all the flavors just a bit more pronounced.
Flour City Ruddy Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flour City Brewing Co.;"2004 draught. The fact that Empire, and now Flour City (the new Empire) insist on serving their beer ice cold, REALY pisses me off. This one tastes dry, lightly skunked and sour, with metal notes, overly astringent and acidic notes from the toasted malt. Did not come together well at all. Like marmalade on a overly toasted English muffin. Gotta be in the mood I guess. Aroma is severly lacking. Appearance is a light ""ruddy"" red with a small off-white head."
Flour City Ruddy Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flour City Brewing Co.;"Buffalo Brewfest 04. Amber pour. Some hops and caramel in aroma. Big white head. Crisp mouthfeel, a tad thin, but not too distracting. Lots of malt in taste - sweet, but balanced. There�s no overwhelming reason to rave about this beer, but I found myself wanting to try more - very drinkable and in terms of ""Amber Ale"", this is very solid."
Flour City Ruddy Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flour City Brewing Co.;Sweetish aroma, slightly corny, hoppy, buttery. Flavor is vaguely citrus, malty and a bit of sourness. Orangey malt finish lingers at the back of the tounge
Flour City Ruddy Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flour City Brewing Co.;Balanced though malty, with suffiient hoppiness to keep it popular. perhaps multiple malts. Average around, nothing exceptional but finishable.
Flour City Ruddy Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flour City Brewing Co.;Every time Flour City releases a new beer, I find a new favorite. Ruddy Red is my current favorite, easy drinking with lots of personality.
Flour City Ruddy Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flour City Brewing Co.;(Draught) Sampled at the Empire State Brewing Fesitval. Ceep orange body with a thin white head. Floral and hoppy yet with a mild milkiness that is not discouraging? Good!
Flour City Ironhead Old No. 3;Rochester, New York, United States;Porter;Flour City Brewing Co.;Tap at the brewhouse. Great appearance...smoky and chocolate. Mild coffee flavor. Not the best porter, but a decent one. Overall, Flour City impresses me...
Flour City Ironhead Old No. 3;Rochester, New York, United States;Porter;Flour City Brewing Co.;Very flat pour. Redish brown in color, light for a porter. Light in body. The roastiness dominates the flavor, with subtle hops coming through. If you are in the mood, this porter can hit you good. Otherwise, it is decent.
Flour City Ironhead Old No. 3;Rochester, New York, United States;Porter;Flour City Brewing Co.;Aroma is tootsie rolls. Flavor is bleh. I wish I could say that this was an infection, but this is the 2nd time I�ve had it and thought of burnt rubber. Sweet and watery.
Flour City Ironhead Old No. 3;Rochester, New York, United States;Porter;Flour City Brewing Co.;2004 draught at brewery. Pours deep, dark brown with a small tan head. Has a nice roast aroma with plenty of chocolate, coffee, malt and nuts. Thin to medium bodied, this beer was very easy to drink yet it didn�t leave me feeling like it was missing something. Good quality roasted flavors, chocolate, coffee, medium-dark malts, nuts, and some bitterness round out the flavor. It was very smooth, yet quite nicely bitter and full of flavor. My favorite from Flour City so far.
Flour City Ironhead Old No. 3;Rochester, New York, United States;Porter;Flour City Brewing Co.;Dark brown w/ very thin, light brown head. Robust aroma of chocolate, coffee, & nuts. Thin, medium feel. Nice, lightly roasted, dry flavour of chocolate, coffee, & nuts.
Flour City Ironhead Old No. 3;Rochester, New York, United States;Porter;Flour City Brewing Co.;Buffalo Brewfest 04. Classic chocolaty porter smell. Black pour with red hues. More roasted chocolate in taste, but dry and thin as well - I found it very similar to London Porter, just a little hoppier, but with less going on. Overall, pretty good, but nothing outstanding.
Flour City Ironhead Old No. 3;Rochester, New York, United States;Porter;Flour City Brewing Co.;Tap. A fair porter. Some nut and roasted grain in the aroma. Somewhat thin. Bittersweet taste. Some traditional porter flavors. Decent.
Flour City Ironhead Old No. 3;Rochester, New York, United States;Porter;Flour City Brewing Co.;Tasted at Buffalo Brewfest: Tastey porter with plenty of coffee in the flavor and a roasted burnt taste. Reddish brown color.
Flour City Ironhead Old No. 3;Rochester, New York, United States;Porter;Flour City Brewing Co.;I had a Draft of this at the Flour City brewfest. I did not enjoy the smoky/coffee aroma and flavor. It was smoother than I had expected though.
Flour City Ironhead Old No. 3;Rochester, New York, United States;Porter;Flour City Brewing Co.;bolder coffee aroma and roast appearance and taste. But not a smooth chocolatey porter as is often the case. Some nuttiness but not overly complex,
Flour City Black Magic Stout;Rochester, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Flour City Brewing Co.;[At GABF 2004] A black beer with a brown head. The aroma is sweet roasty, while the flavor is dry woody combined with notes of roasted malt, but the body is thin.
Flour City Black Magic Stout;Rochester, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Flour City Brewing Co.;Dark brown almost back w/ creamy finer of light brown foam. Excellent lace. Roasty aroma w/ lots of dark chocolate, burnt coffee & a hint of nuts. Thin feel for style. Decent dry stout flavour (dark chocolate, coffee, dried fruit) w/ a mildly bitter finish. Not overly complex, and almost bland if too cold.
Flour City Black Magic Stout;Rochester, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Flour City Brewing Co.;VERY drinkable stout. Let it sit and warm up a bit. Great appearance. Chocolate and coffee...roasted malt. Not too overpowering. Solid stout.
Flour City Black Magic Stout;Rochester, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Flour City Brewing Co.;Very enjoyable. Dark dark almost black with espresso head. Coffee tones along with the roasted malt and chocolate malt. Had this one at the brew pub where it comes from, nice and fresh. Fine beer.
Flour City Black Magic Stout;Rochester, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Flour City Brewing Co.;2004 draught at brewery. If you read clarkvv�s rating, he mentions that this beer is carried over from Empire Brewing Company�s beer, and he�s right. Pours dark black in color with a small white head. I let mine warm up a bit before tasting it. It has lots of roasted scents, burnt chocolate, and coffee in the nose. A very dry stout with lots of roasted malt, chocolate, and a hint of coffee, just like your nose predicts. Though most had noted the smoothness, when I tried it, it seemed to me as though there wasn�t any nitrogen used. After talking to the brewer, turns out my palate did indeed correctly catch that. I tasted the batch that they had sent to the GABF, which they did not nitrogenate for the travel. Not too watery, not too thick, lots of roasted notes and some bitterness from the dark malts used here.
Flour City Black Magic Stout;Rochester, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Flour City Brewing Co.;"2004 draught. Well here it is, carried right over from Empire Brewing Company�s days. Their award winning dry stout. Still as good as I remember, though after having tried many more dry stouts, it dosent stick out as much. I suppose I could just copy my rating from Empire�s page, but instead I will just use this one as a rerate. Color is still magnificent and the aroma is decent taking in to account the style and the fact that they serve this at about 5 degrees Kelvin. Flavor is quite dry, roasty and has the billed ""chocolate"" and ""roast"" notes. Some chewiness, but I would like more. Lively carbonation and a medium body, but it never really waters down too much. Some bitterness but from the roast, not hops. Listed at 4.3 abv it�s certainly an easy and quick drink. I could think of many worse things than drinking this stuff down while sitting at the bar and watching some football."
Flour City Black Magic Stout;Rochester, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Flour City Brewing Co.;amber colour. No roasty aroma. Great head of cream. Not too strong at 5.5%. Roasty coffee cream, somewhat smooth, and somewhat bitter taste.
Flour City Black Magic Stout;Rochester, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Flour City Brewing Co.;"I am a stout lover from way back and I must say this is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. It�s rich and not overly bitter. If you�re a Black and Tan lover, the ""Dirty Harry"" is Flour City�s 44 Magnum topped off with Black Magic. Absolutely delicious!"
Flour City British Attack IPA;Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;Hazy amber w/ pale tan foam. Mild hop aroma w/ some light malt in the background. Medium, slightly sticky feel. Nicely balanced flavour w/ some earthy bitterness. Very much in the English style.
Flour City British Attack IPA;Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;pretty weak for an IPA. Only a mild sour hop note in the finish. More like an american pale ale than an IPA..
Flour City British Attack IPA;Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;Not a lot going on with this one. Decent appearance but on the watery side, considering this place is supposedly know for their pale ales I was disappointed. Not hoppy enough to be called an IPA.
Flour City British Attack IPA;Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;Nice and fresh IPA. Deep golden color with little head. Spicy hop aroma. Watery body but good hop flavor, little malt to speak of. Spicy hop finish. Decent brew.
Flour City British Attack IPA;Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;2004 draught at brewery. Pours to a light golden color with a nice white head. It doesn�t really taste like you would expect an EPA to taste. Very american hoppy aroma, citrus, grapefruit, orange, and a touch of malt. The menu states 45 IBU�s, though it tastes more than that to me. Hops dominate the flavor with lots of grapefruit, floral, and very bitter notes. The malt just can�t keep up. Medium bodied, excellent carbonation are two things I can�t complain about. I would love to see a change of hops, maybe a bit more earthy or caramel notes in this one.
Flour City British Attack IPA;Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;"2004 draught. Very bright yellow/pale gold appearance, chill haze and a good wispy white head. I was hoping for a English style IPA, but alas, it only includes the British word to go with the name; it is in fact an extremely bitter, unbalanced American interpretation. Though it does have some tasty fruit esters (orange, ruby grapefruit), there is no real attempt at a true balance (though I�ve had much more unbalanced than this). Juicy and bitter and at 7.1 abv, quite warming, but unspectacular and not what I would believe the British had left behind. Greg Smith (head brewer) has gone hops crazy. Medium to medium full body, floral hops (mainly) on the nose. Lots of astringency. Low sweetness. Added points for being fresh. Not fresh, this beer wouldnt cut it."
Flour City British Attack IPA;Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;Had a preview. Think they are still experimenting. More convention IPA and a bit watered down version of the Magnum 44 Double IPA. I think this detracts rather than adds.
Flour City British Attack IPA;Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Flour City Brewing Co.;I tried this beer on opening night at the brewpub so it may have been a little young. It has a nice unfiltered appearance. The smell is somewhat hoppy, the malt and bitterness is apparent. Good for british IPA style. I would prefer an american IPA, but I will not deduct for that.
Flour City Hoppy Accident Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flour City Brewing Co.;2004 draught at brewery. Pours to a clear, golden/yellow color with a small white head. Aroma: hoppy and sweet, with some toffee, caramel, and butter. As others have noted, the flavor here is quite different from the average APA. There�s some hops, but the flavor really features the malt and caramel. I asked head brewer, Greg Smith, about the taste and he confirmed the caramel malt taste. This is much sweeter and less bitter than what you�d be used to in this style. Nice, thick, medium body with excellent carbonation.
Flour City Hoppy Accident Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flour City Brewing Co.;2004 draught. Pours a warm golden colored yellow with small white head. Aroma is buttery and lightly sweet, with hints of sweet toffee and caramel. Flavor is quite the opposite of an APA, very malty, sweet and caramelly, with only some mildly bitter hops on the finish. Light butter-cream flavor, hints of light fruits. Good medium body, with little to no thinning.
Flour City Hoppy Accident Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flour City Brewing Co.;Buffalo Brewfest 04. Very light colour IPA. Slight hoppiness in aroma. Taste is a little underwhelming for the style, but again, decent fruity hops with a light crisp taste. This seemed to get better as I had it, mainly because the effects of the previously sampled Magnum were wearing off. Not bad.
Flour City Hoppy Accident Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flour City Brewing Co.;Tap. Decent but ordinary APA. Hop aroma is a little light. Bitterness is balanced by malt fairly well. Medium bodied.
Flour City Hoppy Accident Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flour City Brewing Co.;I tried this beer on opening night of the brewpub. I have to say I was quite excited as I love the hops. To me it seemed there was a good number of bittering hops, but not really enough flavor and aroma hops. Mild malt flavor. Less taste overall than I like in a pale ale.
Flour City The Blonde;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flour City Brewing Co.;Grassy, noble hops. Flavor is kind of grassy, nicely bitter, grape skins. The best Flour City I�ve had so far
Flour City The Blonde;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flour City Brewing Co.;Draft at Flour City Brewfest. Suprisingly this did not go down as easy as most Blondes I know. I won�t try this again.
Flour City The Blonde;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flour City Brewing Co.;A popular transitional ale to get Bud fans into a craft beer habit. Too carbonated and sweet for me,
Wicked Hathern Derby Porter;Loughborough, Leicestershire, England;Porter;Wicked Hathern Brewery;Bottled, I think. Deep ruby pour with a creamy, well-retained tan suds. Soapy liquorice snout. Lightly smoky malt with hints of milk chocolate. Musty hops emerging. Toffeeish. Lingers smokily. Silky, chocolate-accented porter.
Wicked Hathern Derby Porter;Loughborough, Leicestershire, England;Porter;Wicked Hathern Brewery;Cask@Loughborough Beer Festival 2007. Dark beer with a roasted aroma and a lightly malty flavour. Overall a nice beer.
Wicked Hathern Derby Porter;Loughborough, Leicestershire, England;Porter;Wicked Hathern Brewery;Bottle (5.0% abv) from Hathern Post Office. Good looking porter, opaque near black brown, with a slim beige head. Nice sweet chocolate malt aroma. Nice combination of flavours, chocolate, roast malts, coffee, some licorice and fruits. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated. A very good porter
Wicked Hathern Derby Porter;Loughborough, Leicestershire, England;Porter;Wicked Hathern Brewery;BCA (From Bitter Virtue, BBE Jan 07. Initial raspberry aroma with light chocolatey malts. A pleasant combination. Body a disappointment tending towards a charred roastiness. Promising start which doesnt deliver.
Wicked Hathern Derby Porter;Loughborough, Leicestershire, England;Porter;Wicked Hathern Brewery;Dark bottle coditioned with that acidic edge that some bottled conditioned beers have.On top of this I found it hard to trace any real flavour.No doubt in its cask form it�s quite a pleasant porter.
Wicked Hathern Derby Porter;Loughborough, Leicestershire, England;Porter;Wicked Hathern Brewery;Very dark brown with red tints. Aromas are sweet and earthy roasyt malts with oats and winter fruit. Flavours are sweet, almost sugary, with earthy oatiness, chocolate and coffee. Lightly fruity and floral, its quite decent.
Wicked Hathern Derby Porter;Loughborough, Leicestershire, England;Porter;Wicked Hathern Brewery;Cask conditioned - Gravity - Derby BF. A dark brown porter with suprisingly little aroma. The taste is very pleasant with a subtle smokiness as well as some licorice notes. Apparently this is an old Scottish recipe. Very pleasant
Cwmbran Blackcurrant Stout;Cwmbran, Wales;Stout;Cwmbran;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Fairly thick, beige head. Opaque black, errr synonym maybe? Really odd flavour. Thin Ribena frosting on a weird, mixed-up and unsatisfying Stout. Some choc and ash emerges in the second act, but not to a good level. Doesn�t quite work.
Cwmbran Blackcurrant Stout;Cwmbran, Wales;Stout;Cwmbran;Cask Stillage at the Paradise Brewery Bar, Wrenbury 29/12/2004 Dark coloured very sweet and rich on the palate. Slightly dry oyster flavoured roast finish.
Cwmbran Blackcurrant Stout;Cwmbran, Wales;Stout;Cwmbran;A good looking dark beer. Aromas are earthy with berries (probably black!) with roast malts and some floral aspects. Flavours are earthy with blackberries. This was too sweet for me, almost syrupy. Has a decent fruity finish but didn�t do much for me overall.
Cwmbran Blackcurrant Stout;Cwmbran, Wales;Stout;Cwmbran;Cask conditioned - Gravity - Derby BF. A very dark, almost black beer with a hint of rubiness. the taste is roasty like a good stout but the fruit really comes through. The aroma is a bit of a mish-mash and lets the beer down a bit.
Ramstein Pilsener;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;High Point Brewing Company;White head. A little more color than other pilsners. Clean crisp. Balance leans a little more to the Malt. Hop bitterness accentuates without ruling over the malt.
Ramstein Pilsener;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;High Point Brewing Company;Nice fluffy head with small bubbles. Good clarity, earthy, spicy hop aroma well balanced by mild malts. Taste is crisp, slight breadiness underscored by the hops. Hoppy tasting but not too bitter. Flawed with a slight DMS aftertaste, but very nice nonetheless.
Ramstein Pilsener;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;High Point Brewing Company;Clear light golden in color with a nice head. Clean aroma with hops and malt. Crisp and clean flavor. Very good. Drinkable.
Ramstein Pilsener;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;High Point Brewing Company;Growler filled at the brewery. Clear light golden color with a perfect rocky white head. I may be a bit biased, but this has a perfect clean aroma with a touch of hops and malt. Flavor is clean crisp and smooth, with the Saaz hops having a big flavor component. Bitterness is well blended with a nice round malt profile. No off components to speak of. Well made and a seaker for Pils fans in the area.
Olde Peninsula Doppel Dunkel Weizenbock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;Black, dark as night w/little head. Light and sweet malt nose. Medium palate w/some sweet mid palate and a dry burnt toast finish. Not bad
Olde Peninsula Doppel Dunkel Weizenbock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;Very black body with a nice cream colored head. Smells like thick coffee. Nice full flavor, nice and bitter. The flavor is layered and quite deep, espresso, on toffee, on chocolate. Quite nice. Smooth and a little dry. The alcohol hits you right in the face.
Olde Peninsula Summer Hefeweizen;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;On tap. Straw golden pour, fairly cloudy, with a smaller white head. Nose of cloves and spices, with plenty of wheaty tart overtones and a somewhat strange toasted note. Taste is lightly tart with some bitterness and not much sweetness. Palate is lighter, active, with a lingering spicy finish. An ok brew, but not spectacular by my account.

Cloudy pale color. Nutty, peanut butter aromas, with hints of caramel and toffee, doughy yeast and a light hint of banana and clove.

Light cookie and nutty malt, with a light hint of clove but pretty much just a thin sourness. Not very good, but wow, what an aroma.

Some orange marmalade in the middle. Very old school. Not my thing. Chrissie felt this and the Mauldon were a bit green, and I had to agree. Surprising for a pub which prides itself on the beer�s quality and won CAMRA Pub of the Year.
Thunder Canyon Bees 'n' Berry;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass at the brewpub. The appearance was a hazy orange color with some red highlights here and there around the glass. Bar pour yielded no head. The smell started off with a sweet red raspberry and then a light tart raspberry came in to balance and then after that a light sugary sweetness came in. The taste was mainly sweet through the raspberries but after a while the sugary flavor came back. On the palate, this one had a tart and sweet raspberry aftertaste that seemed pretty authentic and I would say that this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. The carbonation was decent for the style and for me. Overall, decent raspberry ale I believe I could take to the dome again.

Flavor is more definable blackberry...a bit syrupy but good.
Mauldons Three Lions;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mauldons;Handpull cask at the Townhouse, Ely. Golden brown, a fair bit of white head and a hell of a lot of lacing. Light bramble, grain and red cherry aroma. Bittersweet taste with a sweet cherry edge. Stone fruit-y without being cough syrup-y. Body is a bit boring. Pretty tasty and solid in construction but not in the least adventurous.
Mauldons Three Lions;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mauldons;Crown & Thistle, Gravesend. Old gold best bitter with a big dusty hop finish. The mouldy fruit is quickly swamped by the hops. Big dry finish. Quite drinkable, but not really my thing.

Quite a still, sweetish beer with a fruity malty feel to it. Some light, floral hop, but mostly a lemony, sweet flavour. Light finish.
Dow Bridge Rataed;Catthorpe, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dow Bridge Brewery;BC from The Wine Cellar. Lager gold with a slender white head persisting solidly. Quite an attractive aroma mingling faint sulphur,occasional farmyard, beeswax, orange and lime citrus, hop leafiness, boiled sweet caramel and almond. Dry, nutty and bittersweet with a lingering hop bite but plenty of softening vanilla, peanut and dunked biscuit. Too much acidity. Slick and soft with little fizz but plenty of condition. Like an unfiltered real lager, but enjoyable. Dowbridge are worth checking out, and whilst their bottle conditioning seems to occasionally impart an unwelcome acidity to their beers, it doesn�t detract hugely from their enjoyment, and embarrasses some of their local counterparts.
Dow Bridge Rataed;Catthorpe, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dow Bridge Brewery;Bottle. Golden beer with a light head. The aroma is lightly grassy and the flavour is grassy, yeasty, slightly malty and gently bitter. Overall a poor beer.

La Mare au Diable Aphrodite;Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Mare au Diable;An unclear orange beer with a disappearing head. The aroma is of ginger, coriander, and oranges.

La Mare au Diable Aphrodite;Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Mare au Diable;Lemon-citrus-orange, coriander aroma is very tart and unappealing.

La Mare au Diable Aphrodite;Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Mare au Diable;Shimmering amber/dark straw colour. Smells likes coriander soup. Tastes a lot like coriander soup, too. This helps mask some of the underfermented worty notes, lack of any discernable hop and plasticy undertones, but not enough to make it a viable beer.
La Memphr� La Montagne;Magog, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Microbrasserie La Memphr�;Astringent yeast powder sitting at the bottom of a polluted lake...Rotten fruit swollen from the dirty water and caramel worms swimming through the murkiness...The end of this ecological disaster is watery and oxidized, not totally unexpected let me tell you...This tastes like it was brewed with one of those kits that come in a metal can and badly done at that...I would like to know if they use real malt and real hops in there...This is a Valles Marineris on the surface of the craft brewing world, a huge scar laughing for profit�s sake at taste adventurers who dare to enter this sad abode and innocent neophytes who gather the courage to try something different...Sorry for the rant, but sometimes when I come here, I feel as duped as when I buy bottles of Brasserie Breughel...Maybe I should stop...Going there that is...

Sapporo Cool Ruby;Tokyo, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Sapporo Breweries;Draught at the Sapporo Beer Garden. Pours bright fire-engine red. Smells like cherry syrup, and tastes like cherry 7-up. This looks, smells, and tastes nothing even remotely like beer, so is hard to judge as beer, really. It might be an ok soft drink (although I find it a bit cloyingly sweet), but it sure isn�t a good fruit beer.
Sapporo Cool Ruby;Tokyo, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Sapporo Breweries;A clear pink color, like a Cherry 7-Up with a small pinkish head. A sweet & sour scent of cherries & lemons. An unusual cloying taste, not insipid but not very good. Nice for ladies or non-beer drinkers. A change of pace from the mass produced lagers I usualy encounter.

Oslo India Pale Ale;Oslo, Norway;IPA;Oslo Mikrobryggeri;50 cl, bottle conditioned. Slightly hazy, dark golden, nearly two-fingers off-white head, low level of carbonation.

Taste is dominated by the citrusy hops, leaving minimal space for the Pale and Crystal malts to come through. Don�t feel any urge to buy another one, really.

I search this most elusive of Belgian beers for 15 years, and when I finally get my hands on a bottle, carefully preserve it to settle, and in the mean time this ohmepoorheadcharacter gets his rating here before me!

Quite nice at first, but becomes a tad oppressive. Surprising soft-sweet taste with perfumey flavours of rosewater/""amandine"", faint citrus leaf, bit of sweet malt.

Gigi Speciale;G�rouville, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brasserie Gigi de l'Etoile;The �tripel� version among Gigi�s table beers, with loose, unstable, snow white head and �dirty� orange blonde colour, clear. Aroma dominated by saccharose (artificial sweetener), grainy, chamomille, some grassy hops, vague impression of wild yeast, bit lightstruck too. Grainy taste with sweet saccharose, some herbal, mild bitterish hops in the finish but less so than in the Gigi Double Blonde and therefore a tad too sweet - though I can easily forgive this in view of this particular beer style. Gigi remains the most authentic and best table beer producer in Belgium, glad I�ve been there.
Gigi Speciale;G�rouville, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brasserie Gigi de l'Etoile;Bottled. Clear golden, no head. Plum aroma. Saccharine sweet with clean hard mouthfeel. Some interesting fruiy flavour, and definite thirst quenching qualities, but the saccharine sweetness gets too much.
Gigi Speciale;G�rouville, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brasserie Gigi de l'Etoile;"Light amber with greenish shine, very pearling to fluffy off-white collar. Spicey nose, especially parsley, touch yeasty. Sweet taste, a bit artificial too. Spiciness is still there in the background, but gets killed by this unpleasant sweetness. Aspartame-based ""Traubenzucker"", if such thing would be feasible. Light MF, OK, but a slickness again reminding me of artificial sweetener. By far my least preferential from the Gigi light brigade. Sad about the demise of the Unicbier, which was all the better."
Saxon Yellow Submarine;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;@Dartford BF. Tart, sweetish, clean and pretty pleasant in the end, pretty OK by me.
Leek Cherry Sunset;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);27th August 2009 Hazy gold beer. Strong nose of bubblegum - Bazooka Joe! Palate is crispish but also manages to be watery. Tastes of bubblegum and not much else apart from insipid cherry. Finishes dry with the bubblegum still going. Fine if you like Bazooka Joe Cherry - otherwise a bit of a mess.
Leek Cherry Sunset;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);"BC (as �Leek Cherry�) from Fosse Asda. Pale and dusted with a slim white halo. Aroma of banana-flavoured yoghurt, Wham bar, slight cow dung at first, but that soon disperses. Flavour bright, odd, yeasty and slightly grassy with hints of cheese, Wham bar and a dominant banana and custard note. Long, creamy wheat afters with a snort of seawater. Nothing like as bad as expected; more banana than cherry-flavoured and actually quite an enjoyable accompaniment to some late night spicy stir fry."
Leek Cherry Sunset;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Bottle. Slightly cloudy bronze appearance with a thin body.Cherry flavours merge with a basic bitternes. Slight traces of sulphur. Is this a fruit beer or a bitter? Either way it wasn�t very impressive.

Outer Banks Gargoyle Oil Brown;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Outer Banks Brewing Station;[draft - Outer Banks Brewing Station - Kill Devil HIlls, NC] Poured a dark, clear brown with a thin tan head. Very rich and toasty malt aroma with a nice hop balance. Strong malt flavor with a nice hop balance and a hint of sweetness from the malt. Very nicely blended.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Pyburn Pale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;[cask conditioned - Rock Bottom Pittsburgh - Homestead, PA] Poured a pale gold color with no carbonation whatsoever. Looked like apple juice. Had a slightly fruity and malty smell to it. Initial taste was malt and fruit with a smooth malt finish that could have come from the lack of carbonation, but was quite good nonetheless.
Bear Den Hefeweizen;Orono, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bear Brew Pub;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass at the brewery. The appearance was the typical hazy/cloudy burnt orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated immediately. Lacing was barely there. The smell had some burnt wheaty notes over some light spice and a delicate orange/citrus sweetness. Clove, hmmmm....somewhat there, kinda. The taste was mainly the same as the smell with less clove - wheaty sweetness over the orange sweetness. Then the delicate spice. Leads into the aftertaste, somewhat. Wet sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation runs low. Overall, as a hefeweizen, hmmmm.....eh, kinda, but kinda not, pretty sure I�d rather have other hefeweizens before this.
Bear Den Hefeweizen;Orono, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bear Brew Pub;I couldn�t tell the difference between this, the peach thing, and the blueberry thing on taste. I could only separate them on color. They all tasted of a very slight wheat characteristic and were slightly metallic. I only finished the glass on the sampler to be nice.
Bear Den Hefeweizen;Orono, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bear Brew Pub;Draught sample at the brewpub, mid-May 2007. Utterly clear amber -- a very bad sign -- with no head whatsoever....very minimal aroma, maybe a little bit of 7UP, I don�t know....like the brown ale, sewery and vegetal and downright nasty flavor profice, no real estery hefe character whatsoever. Just awful.
Bear Den Hefeweizen;Orono, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bear Brew Pub;Good crisp beer for the summer months. Cloudy light appearance. Reminded me a lot of belgian white beers. Some hop taste, but dominated by lemony refreshing tastes. Another good beer i�d recommend from the bear brew.

Fenland Abbey Tower;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fenland Brewery;Cask@The Wenlock Arms. Cereally maltyness, some caramel and toffee, orangey hops, a touch of honey and butterscotch.
Wychwood Midsummer Nights;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Straw/gold colour. Another one of those golden summer beers, this one at a session bitter ABV. It wasn�t bad, but it was less clean and crisp than the two beers I had before it - Cotleigh BLue Jay and Oakham Helter Skelter. Dry and vaguely malty, with less of a hop impact than I anticipated. Not bad, but a little lacking in zing and thin bodied. Cask (handpump), Lord Moon of the Mall (JDW), Whitehall, London SW1.
CooperSmiths Sitzmans Steam;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Pour on tap at the brewery, reddish pour with thin white head. Aroma brought notes of slight acidic fruits, hints of grain, caramel, touch of grassy earth, but not much going on here. Taste is slightly acidic, slight hints of grain, biscuit, touch of grass and caramel in there. Overall very subdued tastes, and towards the end I got a bit of butter.
CooperSmiths Sitzmans Steam;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Tap @ brewery. Light orange appearance with a white head. Light amber, generic nose. Medium hued malty flavor, somewhat ambery. Great smooth Steam beer flavor but still far inferior to Anchor.
CooperSmiths Sitzmans Steam;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;On tap at the brewpub. Pours dark gold with a medium white head. There�s not much aroma. Flavor of green fresh hops. has a medium body and far more carbonation than most of the beers served here. This is not only not the best beer here, but I think they miss the style by a good distance.
CooperSmiths Sitzmans Steam;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;An ok steam beer. Almost tasted like cider to me for some reason. Drank it at the brewery. I had been drinking all day though so my ratings may be a little off.

CooperSmiths Sitzmans Steam;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;It does remind me of Anchor Steam on tap, so they got the style correct. But I don�t like Anchor Steam on tap, it is one of the few beers that I prefer to drink right out of the bottle. Not even in a glass. But they did get the California Common style down, my congrats to the skillful brewers for not just making an average yellow beer and calling it steam.
CooperSmiths Sitzmans Steam;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Slight bitter aroma. Color is a pretty typical light copper. Taste is nutty, with some serious tart fruitiness. Comes out more in the finish. Becomes more drinkable as it warms up.

Brutopia Imperial Stout;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Brutopia - Brasseur Artisanal;Strong, sweet chocolate and roasty, coffee aromas. Dense finger of beautiful dark tan, small bubbled head atop opaque black body. Floraland perfume-like. Fruity to start. Opens up to a sweet milk chocolate with gentle roastiness towards the end though the fruitiness overshadows all throughout. Fruit and perfume character last in the aftertaste. Medium-full body and creamy smooth mouthfeel. I would have enjoyed it more if the perfume/floral esters had been a touch more restrained. On tap at the brewpub.

Wychwood Three Lions;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);A Wychwood special for the 1998 World Cup which France went on to win. Quite dry with a pleasant blend of mild orange fruit and twiggy bitterness. Nothing remarkable, but drinkable enough.
Wychwood Three Lions;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Bottled, Pasteurised. Golden yellow with huge white head. An aged bottle from a previous football tournament, but not without merit. Full dry malt, medium roast flavours with a sweetish hop note coming through. Not too exciting but drinkable.

Itchen Valley Wat Tyler;Alresford, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Itchen Valley Brewery;Cask (handpump) at The Pommelers Rest (JDW), Tower Bridge, London, February 2007. Dark brown with a ruby tinge. No head to speak of - unusual for a JDW as they usually make full use of the sparkler. Certainly aiming at a Winter Warmer style, with some chewy malt and tart berry fruits, underpinned by a robust, earthy bitterness. The overall feel is rather bittersweet - an attribute that I�ve noticed in a number of Itchen Valley beers - especially on the finish. A solid, perfectly decent but perhaps a little light and lacking in the richness of fruit that one might expect in a Winter warmer. Somehow lacked a little impact.
Itchen Valley Wat Tyler;Alresford, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Itchen Valley Brewery;"(on bottle thanx MartinKubert)This must be one of those Old ale that are...odd. Nice dark orange color, no aroma at all and a sort-of fruity tase; apple and plum. Gets SO hard in the bitterness, real fast in the finish. A very ugly remake of a Sam A label and no rebel of mine."
Itchen Valley Wat Tyler;Alresford, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Itchen Valley Brewery;Quite watery and thin. Some straw is noticable. Medium amount of bitterness in the finish. Quite ordinary ale.

Joules Bitter;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tower Brewery;Cask at Coopers, Burton-On-Trent. Not much aroma but a pleasant flavour mostly of grains and malt. There�s a touch zestiness as well. Okay but a forgettable.

Joules Bitter;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tower Brewery;Bright bottled at Chappel. The Joules brand is owned by Museum, but since Coors have instructed them to concentrate on brewing White Shield they have had to get Tower to brew some of their historic specialities. Not that the folks at Chappel knew this. This was down in the programme as a Museum beer, but I noticed it came out of a Tower cask. Why�s that? I ask. Nobody knows. So they go ask the expert. Back comes the news that Tower and Museum are the same brewery. Fair enough! Anyway - this is a salty red apple best bitter with toffee notes and a chalky finish. Nice character. Nice ale.
Joules Bitter;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tower Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Amber body, deep and bright. Vanilla cream flavour. Malty and easy going. Nice session ale for those that don�t like it too bitter.

Arsenal Mitsne;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Aus diesem Arsenal wird eine starke Bombe geliefert. Der helle Bock mit stabiler Schaumkrone ist so stark bitter, dass es einem alles zusammenzieht. F�r Leute die auf Doppel- oder Tripel-B�cke stehen vielleicht interessant. Mir ist es aber eindeutig zu stark.

Nose brings out straw, cereal grains, maybe some fusel alcohols. Flavour is fairly boozy, with fusel alcohol, cereal grains and straw.

Arsenal Mitsne;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);My favorite Ukrainian macro. It is not sweet compared to other Ukrainian beers and has a decent alcohol punch. Thankfully craft beer has come to Ukraine, so my days of drinking this are about over :)

Arsenal Svitle;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);BOTTLE 50 CL. Pale straw, white frothy head. The aroma is more or less nice - some pale malts, grassy, a touch of sulfur and some alcohol when it warms up. The taste is much worse - again, pale malt sweetness, followed by fusel alcohols, some astringency, nop proper hops - just a hint of alcoholic bitterness in the finish. Pretty crappy.
Arsenal Svitle;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Straw color , thin white head. Grainy aroma. Strange taste with grainy notes

Herslev Sommer Ale Ekstra;Herslev, Roskilde, Denmark;Pale Ale - English;Herslev Bryghus;"Hazy orange beer with a thin white head. Heavy grainy and yeasty aroma with some sourness - it actually smells ""warm""....! Flavor is harsh and grainy and very strange. Ultra dry finish. I believe something went wrong with this beer and that is probably why it was only sold in an extremely limited quantity."

Nelson Rochester Bitter;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Jan, 2007 Bottle conditioned - from the brewery market stall, Rochester. This is nothing like the usual Nelson - this is clean, crisp and refreshing with lots of grapefruit bite, with just a touch of chocolate. A modern ale. No grease, no dirt, no tiredness, no murk. An exciting beer, rather like the sort that Titanic make. I had thought this was good because Nelson have a new brewer - but I see that Spiesy had this in 2004, and thought the same thing. This is good. I�m impressed, and I�m surprised. [3.5] March, 2008 Cask, JDW, Rochester Light, refreshing, fragrant - soft citric notes above a mild toffee / caramel base. Easy drinking and very pleasant. Best Nelson ever! [3.6]

Nelson Rochester Bitter;Chatham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nelson Brewing Co.;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Golden, bright and in fantastic condition. This beer was fully hopped and spectacularly refreshing. Hops were everywhere, flowery, citrus, fruity loveliness. I�ve not thought that much of Nelson brewery in the past but this beer made me eat my words on the day and has forced me to reconsider my opinion. Footnote. Whilst I can�t find any other reference to a plane bitter produced by Nelson, I did go back to the WA and double check with Dave and the pub clip. 3.7% ABV for this one.
Rock Bottom Arlington Geoffweizen;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Arlington;Draught at Brewpub during RBSG DC 06 Weekend Hazy yellow, no head and light lacing.

Rock Bottom Arlington Geoffweizen;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Arlington;Pours a cloudy pale yellow topped by a small head by weisse standards. Retention was ok and little specks of foam were left on the glass. Pleasant aromas of bananas and mild bubblegum. Hints of cloves. A quintessential hefe nose. Wow, an American-made hefe that delivers on the promise. Light tastes of wheaty malts with notes of banana and cloves on the finish. It�s light and crisp, and, of course, refreshing. Overall: Allright, an authentic hefe. I�m growing more impressed by this brewery, at least their one-offs anyways.
Rock Bottom Arlington Geoffweizen;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Arlington;Major disappointment. Not at all interesting and really had more of a grapefruit beer taste than anything else.
Rock Bottom Arlington Geoffweizen;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Arlington;a rather unimpressive hefewiseizen. even a lemon didn�t help much. had the standard hefe flavors, but none of the grapefruit/ bubble gum sutllties.

Rock Bottom Arlington Ballston Brown;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Arlington;Location: Made a trip to the Arlington Rock Bottom the same day I saw The Dark Knight Overall Impression: It�s a decent brown, but it just doesn�t bring a ton of excitement to the table, I think it�s better then the Brown Bear Brown...

Rock Bottom American Dream IPA;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;IPA;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Serving: Draft at Rock Bottom Charlotte. It pours a light orange with a slight off white head. Light citrus nose. Fairly decent hop bite up front but it doesn�t last. Light caramel malt with a slightly off tone bitterness. Fairly pedestrian, but no major issues with it.
Rock Bottom American Dream IPA;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;IPA;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;This was the only beer that I enjoyed from a six beer sampler at Rock Bottom. The appearance, head, and feel are pretty average for an IPA. The flavor, however, is rather unique. This is a balanced brew with moderate bitterness and a great herbal quality. It�s not perfect, but it was good enough to make me wish that the other beers had been on the same par.
Rock Bottom American Dream IPA;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;IPA;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;On tap at Colorado Springs location 14 Sep 12. This single hop IPA hits one note but hits it well. Aroma is of Pink Grapefruit & so is the flavor. It is a crisp beer with a pleasant amount of bitter. White head, fair lacing & mostly lasting.
Rock Bottom American Dream IPA;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;IPA;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Good IPA. On draft at the 16th street location. Good hoppy bitterness with very slight malt reolution. Very copper-yellow and quite smooth.
Rock Bottom American Dream IPA;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;IPA;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;"A solid but ultimately forgettable American IPA, Rock Bottom�s entry is a relatively tame affair with a good balance and sessionability. Clean and zippy in the bitterness, it does distinguish itself as ""west coast"" in the aroma, as billed. Rather, this is a decidedly east coast affair, with muted aromatics and long earthy bitterness supported by a lightly malty backbone. Served unfiltered, American Dream is a somewhat mundane entry."
Rock Bottom American Dream IPA;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;IPA;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;On tap at Milwaukee location, pours a hazy orange with a white head and spotty lacing, very fruity aroma with some spices and pine, the flavor has a lot of grapefruit with tropical notes as well, hmmm, not bad at all.
Rock Bottom American Dream IPA;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;IPA;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Arlington Virginia location. Golden orange color, small wispy head. Aroma is citrus, hops. A bit bready, yeasty notes. Served in a hard plastic cup. Strange.
Rock Bottom American Dream IPA;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;IPA;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;Pours a deep yellow with a great thick white head that will last a while. The nose is fresh citrus and a bit of caramel, but the flavor takes it the other way--medium bodied floral hops mixed splendidly with just enough roasted malt to tone back the bitterness. But its still enough bitter to have its own thing going on. Crisp finish left a bit of sweetness in my mouth begging for more. A great IPA that wasnt as harsh or hoppy as I thought it would be.
Rock Bottom American Dream IPA;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;IPA;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;My favorite Rock Bottom brew. I�m a regular at my local Rock Bottom and have had most of them. I prefer IPAs and this one is tops. Big citruis and hop flavors. Strong citrus nose and wonderful aftertaste. Just a big and bold IPA that�s very drinkable! Big fan!

Valley Brew Uberhoppy Imperial IPA;Stockton, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Valley Brewing Company;"""not quite as hopperific as advertised. also more like an American strong ale than a dbl ipa. less aromatic floral citrusy hops, although there was a little citrus, and more bitterness tempered with a big malty backbone. got it straight from the brewer, so i wouldn�t think it had age on it, but you never know...seemed old."""
Valley Brew Uberhoppy Imperial IPA;Stockton, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Valley Brewing Company;A- Pours a deep, golden, wheaty color with a 1.5 finger, chunky white head that fades with tons of lacing. S- Deep floral hops, grainy with deep undertones of freshly baked bread. Hints of sweet caramel. T- Taste is phenomenal. Starts off with lots of floral citrusey hop notes and is completmented by a wave of sweet, bready goodness. Not nearly as bitter as I was expecting but the hops play a major role in the overall flavor. M- Thick with medium-low carbonation. D- Incredibly drinkable. The hop character is fantastic and everything is balanced perfectly.

Overall: Very good! 1 pint 6 fl. oz. bottle (9.5% Alc. by Vol.) shared by alexsdad06. Thanks Brad! Rating #324 for this beer."
Valley Brew Uberhoppy Imperial IPA;Stockton, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Valley Brewing Company;"A glowing, amber-ish pour filled with golden highlights from my 12oz. bottle. Thick sediment dances along the edges of my glass in anticipation of my first sip: Oh lord, I picked the perfect Sunday night cap to watch the Olympics with. An unrelenting onslaught of alcohol warns my taste buds of an apparent, ""troublesome"" presence. It�s a hop palate crusher. But I like it. Clear notes of resin overwhelm, followed by past ripened citrus oils and another wave of oregano. Bitter through the end and then some. Huge oily aftertaste. Drinkability: Great Sunday night brew. Rebuy: Yes."
Valley Brew Uberhoppy Imperial IPA;Stockton, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Valley Brewing Company;26th May 2010 Hazy amber beer. Little white bubbly head. Rich grapefruit hop nose with some odd sweet emulsion paint. Smooth dry palate. Rich marmalade grapefruit hops - help back by that odd milky sweet paint thing. Before the dry finish the hops turn spicy. Underpinned by toffee malt. A little off the wall but decent.
Valley Brew Uberhoppy Imperial IPA;Stockton, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Valley Brewing Company;From notes. First reviewed 6/9/2010. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. Thanks to azureoval for hooking this up. Uberhoppy pours a dark cherry / burgundy color, with a nice 3 cm off-white head. Not a ton of retention and just a little bit of sticky lace on the glass. The malt is the first thing on the nose, and it is extremely roasted. A great switch up. Tons of hops to go along with it, citrus and pine mostly. A great variety of hops in the flavor. The flavor is different than I have seen in other DIPA�s. Some burnt sugar, chocolate, and smoke join the toffee sweetness to start. After the roasted malt front, citrus hops (mostly apricot and grapefruit) take over, but there are some great pine notes as well. Alcohol sneaks in right at the end, but it is barely present. There is a very noticeable dryness here. Nice creamy feel, with medium carbonation in a full body. A light hoppy oil residue after each sip. A killer DIPA is always drinkable.
Valley Brew Uberhoppy Imperial IPA;Stockton, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Valley Brewing Company;Pours light golden amber with very little head . Smells of grapefruit, pine, and honey. Huge amounts of malt and honey stand out along with grapefruit, pine and citrus. Mouthfeel is thick and coats the palate well. Finish is bitter but medium in length this beer is probably past it�s prime and would have better fresh.
Valley Brew Uberhoppy Imperial IPA;Stockton, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Valley Brewing Company;Golden color with a thin white head. Smells of hops and sweet caramel with a bit of pine and earth. Tastes of bitter hops and pine with some earth and heavy sweet caramel malts. Finish is lightly bitter.
Valley Brew Uberhoppy Imperial IPA;Stockton, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Valley Brewing Company;22oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. No freshness info. Pours a clear, deep reddish orange with almost no foam or carbonation and very little lacing. Nose is quite rich with malt, more roaster than sweet. Hops take a back seat here, barely showing at all. Mouthfeel is syrupy and heavy with no carbonation, almost like a barley wine style. Rich, caramel malt with a good amount of resiny texture on the finish, enough to cut the heaviness of the malt and remind you that this is classified as a DIPA. Hops are quite citrus-y but don�t show well enough to make up for the over-abundance of malt. I am really not feeling this one. It has almost nothing I look for in a DIPA.
Valley Brew Uberhoppy Imperial IPA;Stockton, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Valley Brewing Company;Pours a dark, cloudy amber color with white head a lots of lacing. Aroma is earthy with spices, slight hint of citrus. Taste is bitter, little sweet. Palate is a heavier body with a long, dry finish. Overall, not bad, but earthy, spicy DIPA�s with amber malts are not my favorite DIPA�s.

Golden City Honey Wheat;Golden, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Golden City Brewery;Draught. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (grain), lightly hoppy (flowers), with a light note of honey. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. A pretty boring wheat beer, not much to say.
Golden City Honey Wheat;Golden, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Golden City Brewery;Tap. Pours golden honey with a thin white head. Wheat, honey and faint hop aroma. Wheat, honey and malty flavor. Fizzy and light bodied palate, refreshing.
Golden City Honey Wheat;Golden, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Golden City Brewery;a bit of a girlie beer so my friend terry liked it when we visited the brewery although he was more impressed that they had a chessboard at the bar. unfortunately they didn�t have the full complement of pieces for the game but a win is a win and i�ll take it. the beer was pretty light, not way honeyed, surprising lemon rind tartness
Golden City Honey Wheat;Golden, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Golden City Brewery;Aroma is herbal, clove, floral - like a perfume, but not overpowering. Body is thicker than I thought it would be. Sweet malts and citrus tang, some honey, but not much. Finish is dry, but the body was a little too syrupy to be refreshing. On tap at the Ft. Collins Brew Fest 2004
Saxon Purple Haze;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;several years ago I first sampled this cider while attending the Otley Beer Festival. After several pints the walls of Otley town hall started to melt into psychedelic riot of shapes and colours and I could hear the distinct sound of strange ethereal voices giving me a new perspective and direction to which my life must proceed. I now live in a skip under a nearby motorway flyover, spending my days pushing my supermarket trolley full of tin cans around the town centre and having loud and heated discussion with my fellow street dwellers �rat boy� and �spider�
Saxon Purple Haze;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;A greenish yellow, to orange coloured still cider. The usual Saxon aroma, a sweet fruity nose, then a vinegary aroma. Quite a dry, sour fruit taste. Some tropical fruit elements, but mainly apples in a somewhat sweet and sour, boiled sweet-like flavour. (Cask - The Fox & Hounds Summer Beer Festival 2007, Heacham, Norfolk).
Saxon Purple Haze;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;@Dartford BF. Leafy sourness, some apple and berries, pretty much hits the stop on the tongue where sounress and sweetness meat, quite fun, and easy to get into.
Saxon Purple Haze;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;#26 at Dartford Beer Festival with SilkTork and Duff. A cider from North Yorkshire. These ciders from Saxon intrigued me so much that I tried five different ones at the festival. They mainly have musical names and some had a gimmick, such as artificial colouring. Thankfully, this one was not purple. It had a very pronounced farmyard/manure aroma, much like a classic gueuze. Authentic ciders seem to have much in common with lambic beers, what with the spontaneous fermentation and all. However, the mouthfeel was quite soft and not at all tart, with a slightly soapy edge. here were hints of forest fruit, vanilla and aniseed in the flavour. Weird, but appealing.
CooperSmiths Brother Adams Sparkling Mead;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Mead;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;I am not sure how to rate mead, as I don�t have much of a control to compare against. So I suppose that this is as good/bad as any. I enjoyed it enough but did not want another one. You can taste the honey though.
CooperSmiths Brother Adams Sparkling Mead;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Mead;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Light orange color. Small white head. Spiced honey, wheat, cinnamon. Light body but alcoholic, with some wine-like floral flavors... grapes, soapy roses... oranges and some honey in there as well, as it should be. Interesting, but weird.
CooperSmiths Brother Adams Sparkling Mead;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Mead;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Solid yellow color, small head. Faint sour aroma. Taste is sweet, with pronounced alcohol that really creeps in later in the finish. Honey taste is still evident. Strange stuff.
CooperSmiths Brother Adams Sparkling Mead;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Mead;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;"Wow - my first Mead - finally. This had a glowing golden color, very small ocassional bubbles rising; no head and clear lacing. Aroma was fantastic - honey, clove, herbal, floral. I was expecting a thick palate, but this was more like a wine viscosity - smooth and even a little oily. Very fruity tasting - honey sweetness and summer fruits with a lingering light fruity ending. Makes me anxious to try more mead!"
Boelens Steinbock;Belsele, Belgium;Bock - Doppelbock;Boelens;Bottle at Delirium, Brussels. Dark brown colour, decent off-white head, some sediment. Sweet toffee and not least yeasty aroma. Good caramel flavours with hints of rye bread. Mostly sweet, but quite complex yeasty spiciness. A new Belgian beer that resembles more a Westmalle Dubbel than a German Bock, which may not at all be a bad thing.
Boelens Steinbock;Belsele, Belgium;Bock - Doppelbock;Boelens;"Reddish chestnut beer, reasonably clear but full of yeast spots that seem to be fixed in suspension; white head with reddish shine. End of bottle is very nearly solid yeast. It has some bready smell German style, but even a lot more dark brown candi sugar; sweet and alcoholic. Very sweet taste, gradually fading as if mildered by a bitterness that just doesn�t come out. Bread and walnut notes - like walnutbread, but much more sweet. In the end I get somehow raspberry extract. Very full bodied MF, slick, viscous even. Aftertaste is nutt again. No genuine German Doppelbock is just THAT sweet. But I agree, it comes close. Rid of this raspberry syrup flavour, and they�re there."
Urbanus St. Urbanus Bock;Pfaffenhofen / Ilm, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Brauhaus Pfaffenhofen Urbanus;Amber-Brown in the glass. The beer starts smooth and malty. Fresh and dark with hints of plums, dark fruit and malt. The mainpart is probably a bit thin, slightly bitter, malty and smooth. In the aftertaste smooth-malty, fresh, slightly bitter and fruity. A nice beer, but probably a bit thin in the body. --> 10/12/11/12

An Alarc'h Melig;La Feuill�e, France;Traditional Ale - Other;Brasserie An Alarc'h;"Orange beer, slight haze and a ton of deposit on the bottom; very carbonated beer, lively raising a huge, yellowish head, leaving lace. Very fresh smelling, like young shoots or freshly drying hay, grassy. Maybe a bit flowery, but no honey traceable in the nose. Surprisingly bitterish taste, more spicey than hoppy, or even a bit pharmaceutical. Little fruity flavour, just a whiff of sweetness in the palate. Good balance if anything. Light to medium bodied, not thin. Carbonisation is obvious in the MF. Aftertaste reminds me of some obscure liqueur. Quite nice beer, very dry and attenuated for a honey beer, and a lovely label to boot. Despite being a few months past the BBd, no trace of oxidation - and in a clear glass bottle at that!"
Kronenbourg Pur Malt;Obernai, France;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);Bottle in Les Thons from my dads stash. Clear golden with small white head. Cardboard, bready malts, papaer, soft caramel, apple, sand, a bit of hop extract. Under medium sweet and bitter. Over light bodied. Not too bad for a NA beer.
Kronenbourg Pur Malt;Obernai, France;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);I'm including this beer among my reviews because it's probably the best n/a you will get in an average French bar. That doesn't make it particularly delicious, but it's a fair enough thirst quencher.
Kronenbourg Pur Malt;Obernai, France;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);Bottle at some friends. Golden color, white head. Pretty common low avb beer. Malt and water...
Kronenbourg Pur Malt;Obernai, France;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);25cl bottle. Clear golden yellow with a small white head. Grainy, grassy and floral.
Kronenbourg Pur Malt;Obernai, France;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);Could be easily confused with �Tourtel Malt� or �Tourtel Puro Malto (Blonde)� here on RB but this is from Kronenbourg brewery in France and to Belgium is imported by Carlsberg Importers NV � Ternat so slightly different bottle here in Belgium. F: big, white, average retention. C: deep gold, clear. A: malt, bread, hint of caramel, grassy. T: malt, grainy, hint of metallic, grassy, light sweetness, light to medium body, medium carbonation, for low alcohol beer not bad at all, 0,25l bottle from Carrefour market @ Etterbeek, Brussels.

Kronenbourg Pur Malt;Obernai, France;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);Neither worse nor better than most low alcohol lagers. Very malty, metallic, watery.
Kronenbourg Pur Malt;Obernai, France;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);bottle from E.Leclerc Geispolsheim. Clear golden yellow, fluffy white head, quickly collapsing. Malty with a hoppy touch and a pleasant sweetness. Not bad at all for the style!
Onopa Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stonefly Brewery;"Pitch black body, tan ring of bubbles around the head. Malted grain and chocolate/coffee notes in the aroma, bit of bourbon sweetness too. Big rich flavor, starts with a blast of dried apricot, strawberry and a thick moleasses-y condensed liquor flavor. There�s no discernable alcohol flavor, just heavy sweet ""bourbon"" notes. There might be some bittering hops in the finish, but it�s hard to tell with all the barrel sweetness. A clumsy attempt to hop in the barrel-aged bandwagon."
Avilys Medaus;Kaunas, Lithuania;Flavored - Other;Avilys Brew Pub;Draught @ the brewpub. Pours hazy darkish amber with airy but stable off-white head. Clear aroma of malt and yeast, with touches of honey and hops. Sweetish flavour of yeast and malt, with notes of honey and touches of butter. Hints of dia. Estery and malty aftertaste with bready hints. Well, drinkable but not my favourite kind of beer.

Avilys Medaus;Kaunas, Lithuania;Flavored - Other;Avilys Brew Pub;In short: A semi-toasted grainy amber beer. Drinkable and forgettable How: Tap at brewpub The look: Partly cloudy dark amber body topped by a persistent medium off-white head In long: Nose is slightly toasted cereals with distant citrus fruits notes. Taste is very basic. Grainy semi-toasted cereals, toasted bread crust sensation, a bit of hay, timid notes of citrus fruits, fluffy mouthfeel with an airy sensation. Abrupt finish with no after-taste. This is the type of beer that doesn�t try anything, it just exists and that�s all, not offensive and not enjoyable either, so I�m giving it an average score in all categories. This Kaunas brewpub make very ordinary beer but the place itself was surprisingly classy and so were the customers, people there were giving me a weird look, how impolite, I almost pulled my pants back up and left.
Avilys Medaus;Kaunas, Lithuania;Flavored - Other;Avilys Brew Pub;Tap (Avilys, Kaunas) 6 Nice grainy aroma. anna does get some honey, I don�t. 4 Slightly hazy copper, good creamy head. 6 Simple sweet malty body, pleasant mellow graininess. 3 Full palate, pleasant carbonation. Simple grainy finish, slightly woolly bitterness, a touch earthy. 12 Proper lager - the big guys should be embarassed at how poor their shit is compared to this. Rerate: Tap (Avilys, Kaunas) (5:3:5:3:10=2.6) Woh, what�s the coffee doing in the aroma? Dry and stale. Other nutty grains. Taste has it too. Weird. No honey. Drinkable, but finish is dry and drying.
Avilys Medaus;Kaunas, Lithuania;Flavored - Other;Avilys Brew Pub;Draught@brewpub, Kaunas Didn�t take a note about ABV, but this is much lighter than 6%, around 5%. Nut brown color, good creamy off-white/beige head. Off sour-milk aroma with sweet notes. Light body. Some caramel, toasted notes. Very light honey flavor in the background, a bit more in the aftertaste. This is very lightly flavored honey beer. Unbalanced and kind of lame.
Avilys Medaus;Kaunas, Lithuania;Flavored - Other;Avilys Brew Pub;30th May 2006 Warning! At the brewpub. Early amateur rating! Hazy amber beer. Crisp palate. Sweetish beer but the honey is not obvious in the taste. A little malt. Good.
Kalnapilis Grand;Panevezys, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kalnapilis (Royal Unibrew);Bottle. Bronze with a small head. Strange earthy flavour which is not very inspiring. Appearance is promising but it flatters to deceive. Not a bad beer but definitely not a good one.
Barleys Casino Ruby Ridge;Henderson, Nevada, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barley's Casino and Brewing;Cloudy orange, sour grain and malt aroma, butter or diacetyl, perhaps. Smooth, creamy hops and a little milk, maybe acetone too. Sour milk finish, but still the best Barleys offers.
Winkleigh Autumn Devon Scrumpy (Bottle);Winkleigh, Devon, England;Apple Cider;Winkleigh Cider;500ml bottle (Siidrimaja, Tallinn) Watery aroma, apples thin, little scrumpy to this. Watery taste too, a little bit of apple here, a bit sweet. Only finally does the real interest come out - some honey there (anna got it ages back), and then some savoury oriental stir fry. Wierdorama, but not scrumpy, I say it again.

Long Valley Festival Ale;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Brown Ale;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;"Extremely nondescript. Brown, sweetish malts, and some citrusy hops. Some mild earthiness. Aroma is, unsurprisingly, grapefruit, but there�s not too much of it. I wouldn�t really agree that this is ""mostly about the hops""."

Big Horn San Francisco Lager;Lakewood, Washington, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Westminster - Draught: Had it at the tasting party Saturday. Very floral and sweet aroma with big white head. The floral quality of the hops continue in the taste and so does the sweet malty flavor. Finished dry and hoppy. I tallked with Steve, the brewer, and he used rice in the malt bill. A very drinkable summer beer.
Big Horn San Francisco Lager;Lakewood, Washington, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);One of the better beers that I tried at the Broomfield, CO location. This has a nice effervescent body full of light malt flavor and finished off with a dry spicyness. This would go good with a turkey rueben.
Rattlesnake Creek BlueHawk EPA;Dickinson, North Dakota, United States;Pale Ale - English;Rattlesnake Creek Brewery and Grill;I was tolde there was something funny with the tap, so the beer was a flat but was still pretty tasty. Some fruity malts to it with a nice hop finish.
Rattlesnake Creek BlueHawk EPA;Dickinson, North Dakota, United States;Pale Ale - English;Rattlesnake Creek Brewery and Grill;Deep golden color out of the growler. Frothy, egg-shell color head that left some lacing. It was a little flat on the tongue, but it was a shipped growler, so I am attributing that minor palate issue to shipping. Body is a little thin, but has nice fruity apple/ apricot malt notes and a nice hop bitterness in the finish. Solid session ale, but nothing remarkable. I killed the entire growler sitting here chatting with Ratebeer folks. Thanks to slikwily for the sample.
Rattlesnake Creek BlueHawk EPA;Dickinson, North Dakota, United States;Pale Ale - English;Rattlesnake Creek Brewery and Grill;Nice amber color,small off white head that faded quickly after it was tapped.The aroma was hoppy a bit floral with a hint of fruit coming through a slight citrus maybe.The flavor nothing real special but decent with a light malt side sort of a mild bitter sweet thing going on in there with a mild hop presence.A bit thin bodied but over all a good brew for a once in awhile kind of deal.It�s worth checking out if you can. Rerate:Different batch this time that seemed to be a little better then the first time i had it.Little stronger Hop presence with a nicer bitterness but still it is not much more then run of the mill for the style.An extra point in the flavor column for the effort.
Rattlesnake Creek BlueHawk EPA;Dickinson, North Dakota, United States;Pale Ale - English;Rattlesnake Creek Brewery and Grill;Growler, courtesy of the kindness of a coworker... Hazy copper in color. Faintly hoppy, slightly cheesy nose. Yeasty. Appley and fruity. (some acetaldehyde) Flinty water character, off-dry finish. Hops are subdued and in the background. Quite passable, especially for the only functioning brewery in the state of North Dakota.

Rogue Morimoto Black Obi Soba Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Rogue Ales;650 ml bottle. deep brown pour that thickens up to opaque black, finger of foamy tan head. Aroma is nutty, with some roast. Some heavier malt notes come through in the malt, toffee, but still dominated by nuttiness, some light fruitiness (orange) come from the hops in the finish. Enjoyable but just good for me.

Two Palms Oasis Amber Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Saw this in a local discouter. 12 oz bottle. In appearance this is alright dark amber with a small frothy/bubbly off white head..decent laceing. Aroma is pretty none-descript, just faintly malty. flavour is also not much to write home about, just semi-sweet malts followed by some bitterness in the aftertaste. Ok on the palate..just average. Overall a very very average brew..typical of Portland brewings contract division.
Two Palms Oasis Amber Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Was in Sacramento and needed a primer for a night on the town, and saw this. Decided to try it since I hadn�t seen it before. As a consequence of my situation, I had to drink it straight from the bottle. Tasted a little bit of malt, but nothing much beyond that. Aftertaste was off and not pleasant. Two Palms is ONE PALM TOO MANY!!!!!!!!!!!

Mogollon Donny Brook Irish Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout - Dry;Mogollon Brewing Company;Nitro draft at the brewpub. Opaque black color with a tan head that laced the glass.

Mogollon Donny Brook Irish Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout - Dry;Mogollon Brewing Company;"A pretty sweet take on the dry stout style, this is essentially their Trout stout on nitrogen. Pours with a nice tan head, dark body appearance. The aroma was of rich coffee and chocolate. The flavor followed suit, sweet coffee and chocolate, rich mouthfeel. Refreshing, but too rich to ""session."""
Mogollon Donny Brook Irish Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout - Dry;Mogollon Brewing Company;Pours black with a nitro head. Some aroma of roasted malts but rather mild. A choclatey dry taste, coffee, with a very dry finish. Fairly light body. Nothing spectacular but a descent session stout.

Aroma is wheat malt, light banana, and spices. Flavor is light malt, light esters (banana), and spice (cloves). Light to medium body. This was no thin, flavorless Widmer Wheat beer. It was decent as American wheat beers go. Worth a try if you can find it.
Mogollon Hefevenom;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Mogollon Brewing Company;Re-rate, 6/07: A better showing this time around, banana malty base, yet full of clovey spices in the finish. Sweet and malty for sure, and at 5.9pct ABV, this was more like a higher octane Franziskaner than a sessionable Hefe. Flavor profile fairly good, a touch too sweet, certainly no American hop profiles detected this time around. Original rating: Ok, not a bad one, but boy, this wasn�t the traditional hefe. Poured a cloudy pale yellow color with a modest but not impressive head. The flavor improved as it warmed, revealing a nice banana and clove-like profile. However, the hops used kinda turned me off (American?) and the beer wasn�t up there with the best of its style.
Mogollon Hefevenom;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Mogollon Brewing Company;Aromas of spice and citrus. Cloudy yellow color with white head. Had a good mix of tangy citrus flavor.

Mogollon Hefevenom;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Mogollon Brewing Company;Pours with a big head on top a cloudy yellow beer. Some Clove and Vanilla but no banana. Nice flavors but the fizziness of forced CO2 kinda kills it. Hefe�s should only be served from the bottle with natural sediment. Kegging them is kinda like putting tits on a bull.
Mogollon Hefevenom;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Wheat Ale;Mogollon Brewing Company;Spicy nose, light and slightly murky yellow color with cloves and lemons and a little ginger in the aroma. Thin, but with a thick and maybe syrupy finish, if that makes sense... coating.

Peter B's Pacific Street;Monterey, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Peter B's Brewpub;July 28th, 2014 - Following in the wake of the delightful Passion Fruit Wit comes Peter B�s Raspberry Wheat, another fruit beer, and one, hopefully, with a little less tartness. The color is a sweet blush, almost the same glow as pomegranate juice, with a ring of bright, white foam around the edge, trying meekly to climb the glass. Immediately the aroma lunges forward with both grapefruit and passion fruit, thick and rich, though the raspberry is noticeably absent. The flavor is on the sweeter side, like s shandy, with the same light carbonation and a good body to match the sugar. The flavor then dies out a little bit, leaving behind an astringent but pleasant taste of fresh grapefruit juice. To recap, not a lot of raspberry, but the imposter grapefruit flavor is excellent.
Peter B's Pacific Street;Monterey, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Peter B's Brewpub;This cloudy gold beer has a very strong raspberry aroma and flavor. There aren't really any beer flavors or aromas. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

This seemed to be a mix of two beers from the tap.
Peter B's Pacific Street;Monterey, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Peter B's Brewpub;On tap. Pours a slightly hazy amber with a long lasting off-white head that leaves good lacing.

Peter B's Pacific Street;Monterey, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Peter B's Brewpub;Dark red and cloudy, the nose is a musty and tart raspberry, similar to how the peach notes were on their Peach Ale. Tart, resembling a lambic fruit beer somewhat. Hearty body, much better than most fruit beers.
Milwaukee Classic Low Carb Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Just plain bad,Decent golden color,little to no head with a poor aroma of Very faint malt some corniness and a little bit of some hop,but very little.The taste was pretty watery and plain with a thin taste of Malt and corn with a bit of hops thrown in to break up the monoteny.It�s a brew for the Lawnmower but little else.Needs a try atleast once.
Milwaukee Classic Low Carb Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);This was not a bad beer for the price...but then again, $10 a case isn�t really breaking the bank. Looks to be the last beer I rate in 2004...time to move into 2005!
Milwaukee Classic Low Carb Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Wow, this is terrible. I am shocked at how bad beer can taste. Truly, truly terrible.
Milwaukee Classic Low Carb Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Another piss poor low carb beer. This one is largely indistinguishable from the other low carb monstrosities I�ve had...maybe a tad more flavor.
Saxon Waterloo Sunset;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;A mid orange red coloured still cider.A light appley nose, slightly sour and vinergary. A tart appley taste, although a prominent, sweetish russet flavour comes through to make a drinkable, thirst-quenching cider. (Cask - The Fox & Hounds Summer Beer Festival 2007, Heacham, Norfolk).
Saxon Waterloo Sunset;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;Cask Stillage at the Kelham Island Tavern, Sheffield 06/10/2003 Amber golden coloured with a very fruity aroma. Tangy slightly dry lasting finish.
Saxon Waterloo Sunset;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;@Dartford BF. Sweetish, applesskins, tart/sour finish, solid stuff. Clean flavour.
Saxon Waterloo Sunset;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;#27 at Dartford Beer Festival, with SilkTork and Duff. Odd rosy orange colour. Like the other Saxon ciders I tried, this had a quite authentic farmyard/manure aroma, but was much softer on the palate. This one was more fruity and a bit sweeter than the others. It seemed less well balanced and a bit thin.
Standing Stone Nut Brown;Ashland, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Standing Stone Brewing Company;On draft at brewery. Dark brown, with decent light brown head. Good aroma with malt predominating and a hint of chocolate. Dry, but silky smooth on the palate. Very nice to drink. If you like your brown ales on the gentle side this is for you.

Appearance: clear gold, medium, frothy, white head. Taste: light bitter. Palate: bitters continue, floral hops, light biscuit, fairly malty, light sweetness coming up towards the end.

Chiltern Pale Ale;Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chiltern Brewery;Cask (backlog). Orangeish amber colour with a small head. Aroma is toffee, some bready malts, mild honey, nectar and citrus along with some sap and resin. Flavour is toffee, quite crisp biscuity maltiness as well as some floral, wooden, mildly toasted and quite nicely on the sweetside to coverup the mellow bitterness.
Chiltern Pale Ale;Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chiltern Brewery;Bought @ The Brewery, Take Home 2pt Pack. Light amber, medium body, low carbonation, no head. The problem of take home pack is that the beer is dead flat. I like the flavour, though. It�s definitely better to drink at King�s Head.
Chiltern Pale Ale;Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chiltern Brewery;Cask at the Old Swan, Bucks. Middle amber colour, thin head. Hmm I�d say a fairly traditional bitter, hint of butter, otherwise decent malts, moreish bitterness, not much hop flavour. Very drinkable. The sort of beer I associate with trips to pubs in the country for lunch at the weekend...which was exactly when I tried this, funnily enough!
Chiltern Pale Ale;Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chiltern Brewery;Cask, amber, lightly fruity and dry nose, hints of grape, acrid bitterness and a hint of yeast swamping a faintly honeyed body.

No-Li Summer Wheat;Spokane, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;No-Li Brewhouse;Ugh this beer has nothing. I�d rather have a Blue Moon. Avoid if possible.The only thing saving this is good bar convo at the Sapphire Lounge in Spokane.
No-Li Summer Wheat;Spokane, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;No-Li Brewhouse;Draught at the brewpub. Cloudy golden, small head. Mustard seed aroma. Sweet and fruity, light bodied with some butter and vanilla but not a lot of substance. Low bitterness.
No-Li Summer Wheat;Spokane, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;No-Li Brewhouse;Sample at brewery. Opaque yellow orange, frothy white head. Aroma is so mild that I have a hard time naming anything- maybe a hint of earth. Taste is similarly bland but I can at least find some citrus and wheat. Medium light body, lively carbonation.
No-Li Summer Wheat;Spokane, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;No-Li Brewhouse;Northern Lights Brewing Company--Summer Wheat. 5.00% ABV--15 IBU�s. Cloudy lemon color. Nice crisp tasty refreshing wheat body. (3.5 / 5.0) Sampled on tap @ Brewery 5/12/2007.
No-Li Summer Wheat;Spokane, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;No-Li Brewhouse;Hazy milky yellow white pour w a nice head. Lemony crisp wheaty nose with a touch of honey. Light wheat honey flavors. Crisp lemon finish creates a good quenching summer beer. If it was barrel aged with brett I might like it more. Maybe about 6 percent more alcohol next time would make me give it a 5.
No-Li Summer Wheat;Spokane, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;No-Li Brewhouse;At the Davenport Hotel in the Peacock Room on draft, this came a hazy yellow with a nice white head, and light lacing. Nose of banana, and citrus. Light mouthfeel. Flavor is light malts with a touch of wheat. Not much finish. Easy to drink, and OK for a light summer beer.
No-Li Summer Wheat;Spokane, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;No-Li Brewhouse;Summer beer on tap in november could be dangerous but the beer was fine. Straw colour, no real haze, and a slightly citric sour aroma. Flavour was light and hte wheat was hardly present. Not a great offering.
No-Li Summer Wheat;Spokane, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;No-Li Brewhouse;On draught at the brewery. Aroma is grainy, yeasty, slightly sour. Very complex, I could pick out almost all the components of real bread. Still, not the best aroma, as the strength was very low. Appearance is light straw yellow with a low white head. Flavor is a balance of yeast, malt and low bittering forward. Beer is well balanced with a sweet and sour background and additional notes of bread wheat and grain. Mouthfeel is light bodied, thin with a strong carb feel. Slightly spritzy with a low sour finish. Overall, there�s a lot of great complexity but the hef is just too thin. A little less water for sparging or added to the boil and this could be truly excellent, but definitely worth trying now.
No-Li Summer Wheat;Spokane, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;No-Li Brewhouse;Fifth stop during the ABA Beer Tour �07 in Spokane, Washington. Sampled on tap at the brewpub. Pours a semi-hazy golden blonde brew with a fast dissolving white head. No lacing on glass side. Aroma of wheat and multi-grain malt, some citrus and a touch of grassy hops. Taste is light bodied, lightly carbonated and a dry wheat flavor. Finish is a little watery with a mild sweet hop aftertaste.
No-Li Summer Wheat;Spokane, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;No-Li Brewhouse;Only slightly more haze than mass-produced filtered lager. The wheat flavor is almost indistiguishable. The flavor overall is very mild. When poured, there is hardly any head at all.
No-Li Chocolate Dunkel;Spokane, Washington, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;No-Li Brewhouse;Tap at Maxs. Red-black-brown. Thin beige head, steady. Semi sweet chocolate tones, very mild, clean, fresh. A touch of underlying raisin fruity sourness, maybe not infected but a touch odd for the style..in a good way. Still a quality example of a generally cheaply made style.
No-Li Chocolate Dunkel;Spokane, Washington, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;No-Li Brewhouse;"Tap. Pours deep, dark brown with thin, creamy white head; short retention and spare lacing. Aroma is mute with roast malt, chocolate, earthy hops, plums, and light woody notes. Flavor is roast malt, earthy hops, and dark fruit esters; dry finish. Medium body and low carbonation."

No-Li Chocolate Dunkel;Spokane, Washington, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;No-Li Brewhouse;deep brown (like a porter, so on the darker side of the dunkel category). Aroma/Flavor are lager-yeast notes, somewhat sweet due to clean malt flavors, chocolaty, with some fruity cherry notes from the chocolate.
No-Li Chocolate Dunkel;Spokane, Washington, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;No-Li Brewhouse;Chocolate, caramel, a little roast, lightly sweet sugars underneat, a little earthy on the nose. Perhaps slightly sour/tart as well. Pours dark brown, no head, decent clarity. The flavor is chocolate up front, toasted roasted notes in the middle, a hint of tart in the finish with more chocolate showing up late. Somewhat crisp finish that kind of just falls off after time.
No-Li Chocolate Dunkel;Spokane, Washington, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;No-Li Brewhouse;Draught at the brewpub. Clear mahogany colour, no head. Cardboardy nose. Fairly light bodied with clean, hard mouthfeel. Edgy and cardboardy with low bitterness. Very harsh and messy.
No-Li Chocolate Dunkel;Spokane, Washington, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;No-Li Brewhouse;Sample at brewery. Brown with ruby edges, foamy tan head. Aroma of milk chocolate, caramel, has a German aroma overall though. Taste was kind of weird, plasticy, some cocoa bitterness, caramel, butter. Medium body, soft carbonation.
No-Li Chocolate Dunkel;Spokane, Washington, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;No-Li Brewhouse;Draft, April Brews Day. Dark brown pour, small head. This has a toasty, nutty chocolate aroma. The flavor is much the same, gentle chocolate nuttiness, with a bit of a metallic lager taste to it and a light acidicty. Melow, clean, and very drinkable.
No-Li Blueberry Creme Ale;Spokane, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;No-Li Brewhouse;On tap at Churchkey. Clear gold pour, surprising color. Aroma of distinct blueberry, smells almost fake, blueberry jam, dried blueberries. Taste if fruity but not particularly sweet, no leafy herbal flavors. Palate is med bodied with med carb. I�d be interested in learning the process they used to incorporate so much blueberry aroma.
No-Li Blueberry Creme Ale;Spokane, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;No-Li Brewhouse;Draft. Lightly hazed orange/pink body, small off-white head. Aroma is moderately sweet, blueberry. Taste is medium sweet, blueberry, light cereal. Light-medium body, light stickiness.

No-Li Blueberry Creme Ale;Spokane, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;No-Li Brewhouse;Clear amber color/ white head. Big fresh, plump, ripe blueberry aromas. medium bodied. Decent sweet blueberry flesh flavors with lightly tart wheat.
No-Li Blueberry Creme Ale;Spokane, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;No-Li Brewhouse;Draft, Beveridge Place. Golden pour, white head on it. This didn�t initially smell too promising. Very sweet blueberry aroma with a bit of graininess, something you�d expect from a blueberry flavored kid�s cereal. The blueberry isn�t syrupy or cloying when the beer is actually sipped, though. This is a very pleasant, lightly sweet and fruity beer with a floral, herbal hoppiness that matches the fruit surprisingly well. A nicely put together fruit beer could easily be appreciated by non-beer fans.
No-Li Blueberry Creme Ale;Spokane, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;No-Li Brewhouse;On tap at Collins Pub. Not bad for what it is. Aroma primarily of berries but with some floral, surprising to me. Flavor is mostly blueberry and sweet, a little weak.
No-Li Blueberry Creme Ale;Spokane, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;No-Li Brewhouse;Draft at Collins Pub. Marginally darkish brown, amber pour. Fruity aroma with a slight florally hop bent to it. Taste is mostly sweet with just a light tart bitterness to it.
No-Li Blueberry Creme Ale;Spokane, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;No-Li Brewhouse;Draft at BEVERIDGE PLACE BODACIOUS BEVERAGES BREWFEST �09. Pours a hazy pink gold. Blueberry dominates aroma and the taste. Pretty sweet beer, but bitter hops provide a decent balance. Not a bad fruit beer.
No-Li Blueberry Creme Ale;Spokane, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;No-Li Brewhouse;Hazy purple pour. Interesting. Light blueberry aroma with a touch of malty sweetness. Light blueberry flavors with a malty sweet backbone. Sweet fruity finish. Pleasant.

Small white head. Clear golden coloured and hoppy with some spiced flavour. Creamy and smooth on the palate. Slightly pale malt finish.
Big Horn Honey Wheat;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);"Draught at the brewpub (Salem, OR location). Named ""homerun honey wheat"". Clear golden color with a white head that laced the glass. Light aroma consisting of subdued cereal grain and sprucy hops. Flavor was citrusy and grainy. No significant sweetness or honey flavor that I noticed."
Big Horn Honey Wheat;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Draft - Spokane. Light amber color with a light white head. Light caramel and hops aromas. Not much more than a typical light amber.

Houston Barochan;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Houston;Maker: Houston Brewery, Johnstone, Scotland *** Beer: Houston Barochan (cask, in Edinburgh) *** Style: Bitter *** ALC.VOL.: 4.1% *** Color: Dark copper, clear. Small, creamy off-white head. *** Nose: Red berries, yeast, toffee malts. *** Texture: Light body, watery. Soft carbonation. *** Taste: Red berries, some yeasty acidity, biscuity malts. Muted bitterness (and none to come). Middle is already very weak, with hints of fruit, mild citrus. No finish to speak of. Aftertaste equally elusive. Just ghosts of the first taste. *** Impressions: Strong and individual first taste, then the beer just disappears before my very taste buds. Shame.
Houston Barochan;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Houston;As soon as it came out the tap as pure foam I thought I made a huge mistake. I hate beers like this. But it was very nice. Apparently this is a bitter, but it�s not very bitter. It�s ruby in colour and has a very light taste, almost as flavourless as a cheap lager, but much nicer. Goes down very easy.
Houston Barochan;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Houston;On cask at the White Lady. Appearance - a cloudy amber much like dark honey. Nice head. Nose - lovely caramel and biscuit note with chocolate too. It�s a Twix bar. Taste - actually going into Highland Toffee bar. Palate - medium bodied with a lovely creamy rich texture and a fairly balanced finish. Overall - a lovely luscious Bitter. Lots of enjoyment out of this one.
Houston Barochan;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Houston;Cask at the Fox in Houston. A deep brown colour. Quite some head. Not very bitter. Nice.

Houston Barochan;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Houston;(Cask at Gallows Bird, 20120908) The beer poured deep amber and clear. Its head was small and white. Aroma had butter, malts and caramell. Palate was medium bodied with almost no carbonation. Flavours were mildly roasted malts, butter, sweetness and bitterness. Afteraste was roasty and bitter. Way too much diacetyl but otherwise not bad.
Houston Barochan;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Houston;Real Ale tasted at Gallows Bird MICP. Mild malty nose. Pale large head. Dark coppery colour. Malty fullfilled tase with some hints of burnt sugar. Some hoppiness too. At the end hoppy bite.
Saxon Seventh Heaven;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;A hazy, yellow to orange coloured still cider. A sweet syrupy nose of pears and apples. The taste is tart, but with a sweet syrupy, fruit gum candy flavour. The finish is tart. (Cask - The Fox & Hounds, Heacham, Norfolk).
Saxon Seventh Heaven;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;"From the box (gravity dispense), Wellington, Birmingham 2005. Following on from the ciders at the CAMRA festival, this was even better; very underplayed for a Saxon but all the better for it, some sweet notes amongst the dryness make this easy-drinking."
Saxon Seventh Heaven;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;@Dartford BF. Hope they didn�tname it after that crappy American TV show....anyway, this ain�t bad, tart apple skin, well balanced and clean. Clean and balanced seemed to be character of most of the Saxon ciders, not as funky and cheesy as other English ciders i�ve had, but fun all the same, a nice beverage.
Saxon Seventh Heaven;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;#48 at Dartford Beer Festival, with Duff. My fifth Saxon cider at the festival. Like the others, it had a pungent farmyard aroma, but a far softer palate. This one had lots of apple fruit and, although quite dry, it had a hint of honey sweetness. Quite good, although by this stage in the proceedings, my powers of discrimination were somewhat damaged.
Town Hall Midsummer Nights Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Notes are somewhat lacking, but I had this a while back at Town Hall in MSP. About as tasty as a wheat beer can get!
Town Hall Midsummer Nights Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours a cloudy medium brown, with almost no head. No lacing. Light spiciness in the aroma. Awesome flavor. Full bodied maltiness - wheat and grain and caramel and mild honey. This is accompanied by some prominent fruit and spice character. Actually, the flavor is somewhat simlar to a fine Belgian dubbel. The tart plum in the finish is fantastic. Mildly hopped, lightly carbonated.
Town Hall Midsummer Nights Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tap 8/2004. Hazy semi-luminous dark amber. Rather reminiscent of the appearance of many fantome beers. Apple clove aroma. Good german hefe yeast profile. Intense cloviness. Minimal roast/dark malt character. Long wheaty-sticky sweet finish. Seems more hefe-amber than hefe-dunkel to me. I like the yeast profile though.
Town Hall Midsummer Nights Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Wheaty aroma. Smells like the Dunkel Weizens I had in Germany. Dirty dishwater brown but with a nice amber hue. Small, off-white head and virtually no lace. Banana notes are present in the palate. Has a little bit of a salty finish. Good wheat flavor. A solid and quality brew.
Town Hall Midsummer Nights Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Murky, dark orange pour, Candy sweet aroma with a bit of fresh lake water underneath. Has a bit of a thin mouthfeel. Flavor has bits of sweet chocolate with cloves and bananas making their presence known in the back end. Yast make itself known as well. A bit too carbonoted and thin for my palate. All around decent though.
Town Hall Midsummer Nights Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On-tap at the brewpub: Strange murky fudgesicle brown color, soft and thin beige head, no real lacing sticks, just some drippings sliding back into the fluffy collar. Aroma is slightly dullish lemon rind spice, very slight clove, fruity dark and plummy with touches of earthy yeast giving peet moss or wet dirt nuances. Taste is full, round, and fruity, interesting tang of caramel malts and dark juicy fruits, bringing plum, berries, dark cherries, mandorine orange, its nearly a frickin� fruit salad its so juicy. Spices mingle within quite well bringing bits of clove, pepper, lemon rinds, ginger, and earth. Never overly spicy, it always makes its presense felt in all the right areas. Very subtle and complex. Great flavors in this one. Strong and sweet. Yum. Feel is a bit shy of medium with a fluffy texture and carbonation, much like any hefe, but here the malty rich profile and fruity tang helps it keep it interesting. Even though I enjoyed the hell out its flavors, I had a hard time getting through this glass of beer. I think the overall beefy tangyness kept me from fully engaging quaffability. Still...quite good stuff.
Town Hall Midsummer Nights Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Very good but not what I expect from a dunkel. Lots of fresh fruit and spice. The wheat is there. Sweet and very smooth. I would say it was a hefeweizen if it wasn�t dark. One of Town Hall�s better efforts.
Town Hall Midsummer Nights Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Brown Coloring. No Head. Malt, Some Wheat. Malty Aftertaste.. Sweet/Smooth. Not a Bad Beer.
Town Hall Midsummer Nights Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Cloudy, light brown color with a tad of a head. Nose suggests a few hops and wheat. The taste has the maltiness and wheat one would expect, but it is much sweeter than I thought it would be. Also very creamy. Quite nice!
Town Hall Midsummer Nights Dunkel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;I usually don�t drink wheat beers, but I appreciate what they have to offer. This Dunkelweizen was a complete treat to behold. Slightly hazy, with a nose of plum and wheat. The taste was that of the same, supported by a beefy heft. This has me rethinking my usual avoidance of this style...
Estes Park Kind Coffee Porter;Estes Park, Colorado, United States;Porter;Estes Park Brewery;"Tap at brewpub. Pours a deep black with a cookie dough yellow head and an aroma of nice, roasted coffee. Flavor is thin and sharp melted coffee grounds. Average mouthfeel but the flavor is spread nicely along the tongue. Pretty good; strong coffee notes all around. I had this one more than once during my visit."
Estes Park Kind Coffee Porter;Estes Park, Colorado, United States;Porter;Estes Park Brewery;[Colorado Road Trip � 2006] A dark black nectar this was a great coffee Porter. This was a seasonal that did very well and was awesome to drink. I loved the flavor.
Estes Park Kind Coffee Porter;Estes Park, Colorado, United States;Porter;Estes Park Brewery;Best Estes Park beer. Delivered a nice coffee flavor (no surprise here) but the bitter lingering after taste made it worth the trip. Masked some of the flaws other Estes Park brews displayed.
Estes Park Kind Coffee Porter;Estes Park, Colorado, United States;Porter;Estes Park Brewery;Draught at Ed�s Cantina. Head is mostly lasting. Body is dark brown. Aroma is lightly malty (roasted grain, coffee), lightly hoppy (resin), lightly yeasty (dough). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. Not a whole lot of anything here...in aroma, flavor, or mouthfeel. Ok, but devoid of character.
Estes Park Kind Coffee Porter;Estes Park, Colorado, United States;Porter;Estes Park Brewery;Tap, Ed�s Cantina, Estes Park. Light coffe and chocolate aroma, touch of roast. Thinnish, with heavily (dark roast) coffee flavor. Moderatley sweet finish. A touch of yeasty funkiness in the finish.
Estes Park Kind Coffee Porter;Estes Park, Colorado, United States;Porter;Estes Park Brewery;Wow - the aroma here is a real eye opener. Smells like you just stuck your face into a mound of fresh ground coffee beans! Taste is very robust - strong chcolate malts and very assertive roasty espresso finish. I think I got more of a buzz from the caffeine than from the alcohol! On tap at Ed�s Cantina, Estes Park.
Bricktown The Mexican;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Gross Gross Gross, I�ve never liked this beer at all, perhaps my least favorite at this crappy brewpub. They might as well throw keystone in the brew kettles and supliment it with brown sugar, cause that�s pretty much what this is like.
Bricktown The Mexican;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;The lime added to mine added some (needed) flavor, but it was still bad. Given the choice, I�d drink Tecate...
Bricktown The Mexican;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Lime/caramel/wtf? Bizarre Joly Rancher/vegetable soup/Chick-O-Stick combo with bits of unbuttered(?!) popcorn aroma. Wtf is this?
Bricktown The Mexican;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Draught at the brewpub. Clear golden color, served with a slice of lime. Not much aroma or flavor other than what was imparted by the lime. Altogether unforgettable unless you despise the flavor of hops and beer in general.
Bricktown The Mexican;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;On tap at the brewpub. Darker in color than Laughing Ass. White head with big bubbles. No aroma. Served with a lime so that there is something to smell and taste. Sweeter taste, but has a chemical off-flavor. Weak hops.
Bricktown The Mexican;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Served with a lime that I tossed. A bright gold. Light aroma of next to nothing. The taste is sweet tarts and some brisk hops. Highly carbonated. Pass this one up.
Bricktown The Mexican;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;A poor attempt at an amber, not that there are many good versions of this type. Pours light bodied, medium head, weak on taste, strong on aroma. Good thing I only got one.
Bricktown The Mexican;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;"Sample at the brewpub. Slightly darkish yellow, a bit hazy. Completely neutral nose, just nothing there at all; decent malty body, fairly sweet, no evident hops."
Bricktown Raspberry Wheat;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;"Watery, crappy, tastes like chemicals and bud light. I know it�s a chick beer and everything, but the artificial flavoring added after fermentation doesn�t even make it all that sweet or tasty. Furthermore, shouldn�t we have a little more respect for the ""chick"" beer drinkers, I know they can handle a little more flavor than this."
Bricktown Raspberry Wheat;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;On tap at the brewpub. Yellow fizzy white headed beer like all their other offerings. Aroma overpowering of raspberries. Does not have the burnt, seed-like off flavor. Finishes with a slight bitter taste, but overall very smooth. Overcarbonated.
Bricktown Raspberry Wheat;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;"Sample at the brewpub. Who would think a brewpub�s beers could go downhill from the Light? Sigh. Pale yellow, no hint of pink; typical, reasonably pleasant and simple fruity nose. Rather sour-bitter on the tongue, with virtually no discernible raspberry; light crisp finish with unpleasant off sourness continuing."
Bricktown Willies Scottish Ale;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Scottish Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;"My second favorite of the awful beers at this ""See how much money we can make on poorly made beer"" scam. Watery, too sweet, I forget what it was I ever really liked about this beer."
Bricktown Willies Scottish Ale;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Scottish Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;"This was absolutely the worst beer Bricktown had to offer. Everyone who tasted it at my table had an uncontrollable shiver along with a disgusted look on their face. The beer tasted like is was not fermented long enough with a high sweetness and almost raw molasses taste. This ""beer"" was terrible. After tasting the beers at Bricktown their food must be very good because I wouldn�t pay for any beers in this ""brewery""."

Bricktown Willies Scottish Ale;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Scottish Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;On tap at the brewpub. Reddish amber in color. Fleeting white head. Overcarbonated. Mundane beer. The brewer was not using a Simpson�s character to promote this when I was there, so I don�t know why Ratebeer is showing such a picture credit here.
Bricktown Willies Scottish Ale;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Scottish Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Medium off white head. A dark amber body. Aroma is decent with smoked apples. The taste has caramel and smoky toffee. Salted peanuts in the aftertaste.
Bricktown Willies Scottish Ale;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Scottish Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;This is one of those beers that is totally not worth the trouble, but perhaps the best from this brewpub. Red ale, hoppy nose with a watery pale red body topped by a white foam head. Continue my disappointment.
Bricktown Willies Scottish Ale;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Scottish Ale;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Sample at the brewpub. Translucent deep maple, caramel-maple nose. Excessively sweet, maple-brown sugar character, very little besides. Not really bad flavor-wise, but overpowering and not terribly beer-like.

Victory Braumeister Pils;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);If you don�t like pilsners, don�t bother drinking this even if the only reason you�re tasting it is to be able to add another beer to the list of beers you�ve tried. Or if you think you�ll suddenly like pilsners.
Victory Braumeister Pils;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Bottle at BBE, had this many times but never ticked her for some reason. Pours a clear golden with active carbonation and nice white head. Notes of crisp malt, lemon rind, lime, cracker, flowers and perfect grain. Fire pils.
Victory Braumeister Pils;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Not much of a nose, and I prefer the look of a filtered beer than unfiltered. However, it has a nice, white head and lacing. The mouthfeel is creamy and offers a nice balance of Pilsner malt and hops. Overall, I like it better than Victory�s Prima, but Troegs, Stoudt�s, and Sly Fox (all in the same area) offer good Pilsners, too. To me, it�s a nice one during this segue from Indian Summer into the autumn. Cheers!

Odd vanilla flavor. Sampled 7/30/2004.
Bear Creek Wapato Pale Vanilla Pale Ale;Redmond, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Bottle - Well, this is a rather over-carbonated bottle here. Enough that I just poured another glass and it quickly overflowed, partly onto my keyboard. The carbonation is definitely a distraction, I have to let the glass sit for at least 10 minutes before I can drink any without it frothing in my mouth. No real strong trace of vanilla here, perhaps a bit in the finish and just a touch in the nose, but hardly enough to constitute a titile such as this. Lightly hopped with a slight yeastiness, almost Belgian in character. Not the strongest Bear Creek beer I�ve had.
Bear Creek Wapato Pale Vanilla Pale Ale;Redmond, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Have to pour this one slowly. The head quickly builds and consumes 3/4�s of the glass. It quickly disipates and leaves a copper colored beer. Grassy hops dominate the nose with a gentle hint of vanilla. Creamy texture with malt flavorings that quickly succumb to harsh grassy hops. A faint presence of vailla flavoring is tasted throughout the beer. Nothing exciting, just a good beer.

Willimantic Carriers' Credo Cream Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Cream Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub. Certainly similar to the regular cream, with the changes expected. Solid bitterness for a cream ale with a more complex citrus presence and nice supporting yeasty notes, dough blending well with the malt and light spiciness blending well with the hops.

Aroma is quite malty. Flavor sits neatly on a sweet and slightly toasty note. I found this beer overly simple, that is, not much depth to the sweet flavors and minimal hop complexity.
Willimantic AmBeerlicious American Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;Draught sample at the brewpub, early March 2007. Dark, cloudy amber pour with just the faintest wisp of a head lasting through the sampling....pungent hoppy nose, lightly smoky/toasty, not a lot of malty/bready character, fairly rough and hard....on the tongue surprisingly a buttery, cookieish texture establishes itself quickly, the hoppiness is quite muted, it�s fairly nice at first but a vegetal character creeps in quickly to weird you out.....peppery and fairly bitter to finish, low carbonation. Not one of the more stellar examples of this fine brewpub�s art.

Willimantic AmBeerlicious American Ale;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;They had the cask and the regular side by side, and I chose the cask. Hazy amber, with little carbonation (esp. relative to the fizziness I found in their other beers). Fruity, sweet aroma, smooth, simple, and enjoyable. A bit of alcohol is present. Kudos for having a cask.
Willimantic Workingman's Wheat;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Wheat Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub. Hazy light gold pour with a small head. Wheat and faint citrus. Palate is a bit thin. Okay.
Willimantic Workingman's Wheat;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Wheat Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;sampler at the brewpub, eh, it had that weird watery milk candy flavor some willibrew beers get.

Willimantic Workingman's Wheat;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Wheat Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;Watery underbelly is most pronounced, but a clove flavor is there after I found a lettuce and plastic aroma (strange). Hazy golden color. Mineral water carbonation. Not so good.
Draught House Munich Dunkel;Austin, Texas, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Pretty boring but looks great. Foamy off tan head. Deep rich and beef broth looking body. Nose is very dark and lagery. Flavors of celery, coriander and lager yeast. Not a fan. G-rat
Draught House Imperial Pilsener;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Deep straw goldrn hue with great head and silk like lacing. Nice earthy and alcohol aroma. Strong hop flavor that is balance with nice maltiness. Strong alcohol finish. Good beer but needs age.
Draught House Imperial Pilsener;Austin, Texas, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Excellent showing here. This brew has the deepest straw color ever miaginable. Nose is sweetly hoppy. Lacks the traditional spicy hops smell of a saaz or tetternang I think because they used cascades...interesting. Very floral, like walking into a flower shop. Alcohol is very apparent, but not vulgarly so. Malts dissapear at first under the strong strong hop character this beer has. Then they peek through slowlyas the carbonation and lager yeast become more apparent. Dense mouthfeel, but not maltilly so only by virtue of the alcohol. Thus it remains somewhat light and yet retains the complexity of texture that darker thicker brews have. So excellent Cheers to the draught house. G-rat

Prescott Walnut Brown Ale;Prescott, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Prescott Brewing Company;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a semi-dark brown color with a cap of a white foamy head that dissipated at an even pace. Sly lacing. The aroma was all about the nuts, but mainly sweet. Some roastiness but even that seems a stretch. The flavor smoothly leads with the sweet nutty malts. Fully sweet malty aftertaste and sticky finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a sly sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation feels good. Overall, as a brown ale, it somewhat does the trick. Aroma seems to lead to one side a bit much.
Prescott Walnut Brown Ale;Prescott, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Prescott Brewing Company;Sampler, This one is went down smooth. Had a nutty aroma and nutty flavor. Was little rich which most likely gave it that smmothnees on palate.

Marietta True Meridian;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Marietta Brewing Company;So, this beer tasted good but more of a session than an Amber ale. Smelled of pennies and carmel, tasted of vanilla, carmel, copper, and some perfume. Weird. Not their best brew.
Marietta True Meridian;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Marietta Brewing Company;My 1st taste of Marietta Brewing and it didn�t let me down. Nice soothing ale to quench the thirst of this weary traveler. Enjoyed before lunch was served. Poured a cloudy light amber color out of the tap producing a lasting, thin off white head and subtle lacing. Front malt aroma that is sweet and nutty. A noticeable noble hop scent backs the malt up very well. Medium malt body, very balanced and easy to enjoy. Lots of caramel flavor with fruity overtones. Green hops in the middle and a nutty aftertaste, very nutty. This would probably be my everyday beer if I was in the neighborhood of this brewpub.

Marietta Pale Ale;Marietta, Ohio, United States;IPA;Marietta Brewing Company;No wimpy Pale ale, but can�t say there�s anything amazing going on here. Kind of SNPA-like. Some orange and perfumey hints here and there. Hazy appearance. Solid session.

Iron and faint cocoa-scattered cherry blossom taste with heady fruit loaf, honeyed rubber and almond tones disclosing the alcohol content. Quite a displeasing hot waxy aroma edging towards the park bench with cherry, almond and marzipan aplenty. Cordial red with not much head. Some retronasal praline-spread bread and toffee popcorn malt before the boozy wafts of palinka heat kick back in. Fine, drinkable but dull bock. Bit of a waste of units.
Reutberger Josefi-Bock;Sachsenkam, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Klosterbrauerei Reutberg;Exactly what I expected from a Bavarian Bock. I�m more acquainted w Celebrator DB, which you can get on tap in America surprisingly often. I like Celebrator a lot, which is better on tap than by bottle. Bottles don�t even come close. That said, this Bavarian Bock is the real deal. The characteristic complex Bavarian malt flavors are there. Sweet flavor you get in some Belgian Dubbels. Excellent and true to style, Authentic Bavarian Bock! Loved it. Dark caramel color, not really a helles but who cares?
Reutberger Josefi-Bock;Sachsenkam, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Klosterbrauerei Reutberg;Bottle at Beerdock Leek. Pours a clear pale amber colour with a medium off white head. Aroma of bready malts, banana, bubblegum, some toffee, slight sugar syrup, a hint of fruit and subtle spice. Taste of bready malts, caramel, banana, some clove, slight toffee, a little sugar, a hint of fruit and subtle spice. Medium bodied and a slick texture. A sweet, slightly fruity, spicy finish. Very sweet and sickly, not very refreshing. Sticky toffee and spicy fruit flavours though.
Reutberger Josefi-Bock;Sachsenkam, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Klosterbrauerei Reutberg;"Tap at the Klosterbr�ust�berl. Amber color with tan head and los of bubbles visible. Aroma is bubble gum, toffee, caramel malts, some herbal hops, dried fruits. Taste is toffee, juicy malts, dried fruits, a touch of petroleum, a bit sirupy, medium sweetness. Chewy body, medium carbonation, fruity aftertaste. A very nice ""Urbock""."

Marietta Weiss Bier;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Marietta Brewing Company;Sat at the bar and enjoyed this crisp weiss w/ my lunch. Paired very well with the fancy salad and Tomato Basil soup I ordered. Slightly hazy golden yellow with a very thin head and next to no lacing, not how a hefe should look. Aroma made up for the lackluster appearance as it was busting with banana and clove scents. Spicy and fresh to the nose the fruitiness captured my attention. Sure is light on the palate, even for the style, still maintains a good refreshing quality. Flavor is more mild than the aroma. Banana and lemon, pepper and clove, grassy. A lighter hefe that�s easy to put back.
Marietta Weiss Bier;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Marietta Brewing Company;had a pint of this a while back, very very cloudy. Didnt taste all that bad, but the nasty cloudy look made it nasty to begin with. Idk, had a decent mild flavor to it, but they might want to strain it or something.
Marietta Weiss Bier;Marietta, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Marietta Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. Cloudy, translucent golden..banana-clove nose, sweet yet restrained. Body sweet at first, bananas throughout, fairly heavy towards the finish, dryish in the throat and a bit too much carbonation. Nice overall.
Lancaster Oldtimer Altbier;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Big hop aroma with a faint hint of caramel. Cascades in an alt? Oh heavens, that just does *not* work. A rich, sweet, biscuit beginning, bitterness in the middle, slight spiciness in end. This kinda works, okay. Oddly enough, without the aroma, the bitterness and the caramel work well together. Shame it doesn�t smell better.
Lancaster Oldtimer Altbier;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lancaster Brewing Co.;I like the complexity of Lancaster beers, and I like their balance and innovation. The fact that the entire area is a bastion of right wing nutjobs won�t enter into my review. As long as they don�t enact prohibition, I�m cool. The brewpub looks like an old horse barn, and smells slightly better. The food is very well done, and the beers have always impressed me. This one pours amber with a medium head and minimal lacing. Aroma of malt, slight dark fruit and hopcit. Tastes malty, fairly rich, with finishing touches of nuts, dark fruit, and cinnamon. The finish is slightly dry, and the beer is ever-so-slightly watery, but it is well worth trying.
Lancaster Oldtimer Altbier;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lancaster Brewing Co.;On tap. Poured a medium golden color with an averaged sized white head. Sweet malty aroma with light nuts. Vanilla tastes come through. Light caramel. Sweet tasting.
Lancaster Oldtimer Altbier;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Most definately one of the best alt�s I�ve had. Reminds me of a slightly lighter and spicier version of the Baltic Porter. Nice sweet malt flavor with some vanilla hints sneaking through. A bit nutty also.
Lancaster Oldtimer Altbier;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Draft at the Grey Lodge in Philly. Nothing out of the norm here. Tasted and looked like your typical alt. Very drinkable.
Lancaster Oldtimer Altbier;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lancaster Brewing Co.;This Alt had a nice dry, crisp finish. Spiced (hop) flavor that satisified my yearn for a medium bodied beer.
Lancaster Oldtimer Altbier;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Medium brown, fairly clear with a light aroma of roasted malt. Medium body, smooth, nice malts and a clean crisp finish. A bit of hops at the end. This was quite good.
Lancaster Oldtimer Altbier;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lancaster Brewing Co.;Pint at the brewpub, with Tidiaguy. Alas, I took almost no notes on this, it�s all memory which is poor...unlike this fine alt, which was caramelly, juicy, nutty, just a hint bitter towards the end, and exceptionally full-bodied. Certainly one of the better alts I�ve had, and I�ll take better notes next time!
Onopa Belgian Dubbel;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Stonefly Brewery;No real aroma to this beer, but damn is it tasty! It sucks that the brewmaster who made this has left for Lakefront, because he made some damn fine beers on his own!
Onopa Bourbon Abbey Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Dubbel;Stonefly Brewery;Beautiful looking beer. Damn, is this smooth! It was sad for me to hear the old brewmaster was leaving Onopa for Lakefront and these were his final creations. Oh well, I�ve enjoyed most of their creations, I am a happy man.

Kopparbergs Original;Kopparberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;(Can 50 cl) Classical pilsener golden with a decent head. Rather thin body, a bit watery actually with a surprisingly marked bitter finish, making this not totally in balance. The can art of a workingman anno cirka 1920 resembles something out of the Russian revolution.... 290102
Kopparbergs Original;Kopparberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Canned. Very pale golden, rich frothy head. Sourish in flavour with small notes of canned fish. Smooth mouthfeel, almost soapy with low carbonation. Suggested spiciness. Papery bitterness, not all unpleasant. Lawnmower beer....
Kopparbergs Original;Kopparberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;"The name of the sort ""Original"" is taken in quotation marks even on the can. Good irony. The beer itself is slightly tart and refreshing. Like its low alcohol counterparts."
Kopparbergs Original;Kopparberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Golden, head with big bubbles. Aroma from dough, metal and some spices. Weak flavor with some bitterness in the finish.

Jolly Pumpkin Oro de Calabaza;Dexter, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales;This style reminds a mix between a farmhouse saison and sour. Has that clearish/faint hue of yellow appearance. Flavor is pretty sour/tart...a little grassy/earthy, some sweetness, etc. Grabbed in a flight at Hourglass Brewery. At 8% and all the flavor going on, this could add up, so not one I would want to drink a lot of. A great beer, and style that I do not get to sample that often.
Jolly Pumpkin Oro de Calabaza;Dexter, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales;Pivo u fla�i.

Jolly Pumpkin Oro de Calabaza;Dexter, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales;375mL bottle from Carwyn Cellars 8%abv bottled 10/08/15 Big sparse head forms atop a golden body. Fair barrel influence upfront - toast, vanilla, honey, get a bit of funky hard cheese, some banana & pear esters. Oooo yeah, nice texture, good weight, where you'd hope for a Belgian strong blonde/tripel should be - full, creamy, substantial. Lovely combination of well done Belgian yeast character with oak influence - sweet pale toasty cereals & pale toffee bolstered by vanilla & seasoned wood combining with spicy phenols of clove & white pepper becoming slightly fruity (dry hopped?) with melons, ripe banana & pears & apples. Bitterness low, very easy finish. Lovely stuff really.

Jolly Pumpkin La Roja;Dexter, Michigan, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales;Though I remember having this beer 15 years ago or so, guess I never rated it. Growler(!) from the JP Chicago. Thick burgundy brown body. Really enjoyable beer, delicious example of a Flemish Sour. Oud Bruin. Has some depth, pleasant not all the way devolved brown malts, restrained fruity brett. Drinks a lot more like a quality classical Belgian example than most US beers. Excellent, World Class beer.

John Harvards Munich Dark Lager;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap at the Manchester, CT location. Labelled Dastardly Dark Lager. I assume this is similar enough. I really don�t want to enter another John Harvard�s beer. Dark mahogany with a small but fluffy head. Nice aroma of dark chocolate and nuts. Nice balance going on in the mouth. Dark chocolate, roasted malts, a small amount of hops and a small earthiness all play well. Very nice beer.
John Harvards Munich Dark Lager;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at the Framingham stripmall location. Pours a dark brown color with red tints. There�s some roasted nuts in the aroma, but nothing special. More of the same in the flavor, medium body, clean, hints of fruit, bit of a cardboard aftertaste, but I found the slightly roasted malt taste to be refreshing and tasty (what a poor description). So in conclusion, a decent beer. Goes well with one of there burgers, but holds up fine on its own.

Tart aroma of apples with some honeyed sweetness. Flavour was dry, with plenty of apples, woodiness, and yeast, smoothed by the honey, finishing with some more tartness.

Sheppy's Cider With Honey (Bottle);Taunton, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Sheppy's Cider;Bottle. pale blonde. Oak, honey and apple in the aroma. Swetish apple flavor with persisting notes of oak, especially in the aftertaste. Honey. A considerable dry out effect. Sawdust. Thirst quenching, not too sweet and even some complexity.
Sheppy's Cider With Honey (Bottle);Taunton, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Sheppy's Cider;Pale gold. Sweet aroma with a promising tart background. Taste has a little sourness and even the beginning of a back of the throat dryness. Mainly, though, it�s a not unpleasant if slightly thin sweetness. I�m not sure I�d have identified it as honey.
Mt. Shasta Brewers Creek Pale Ale;Weed, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;355 ml bottle. The label on my bottle says �Weed Pale Ale� and looks similar to the Weed Golden Ale, but with a green color. I guess this probably is an alias to �Mt. Shasta Brewers Creek Pale Ale�. Dark golden body with a firm off-white head. Aroma is sweet malt and moderate hoppy. Flavor is sweet malt, some fruit and a touch of caramel and balanced hoppy. Actually quite surprisingly hoppy and well made to be a Pale Ale as I did not expect much from.

Crisp and light, hops are present but not overpowering. Some spicy fruit comes out as well, maybe apple. Thin ending, kind of boring.
Mt. Shasta Brewers Creek Pale Ale;Weed, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;(Draft: Mt. Shasta Brewing Co. in Weed, CA) Another sugary sweet beer from this brewery, this pale ale is intensely caramely too, but the hops are way underutilized here, resulting in just a sweet, caramely beer. Not quite what I expected from a pale ale. The aroma is also sweet and caramely, and the palate borders on cloying. Deep amber color shows tiny carbonation bubbles slowly rising toward the creamy, tan head. Retention is excellent, holding a steady, thin layer for the session. A moth-eaten curtain of lace is left on the glass, so this is a very nice looking beer, but in the end, it needs more hops for better balance.
Mt. Shasta Brewers Creek Pale Ale;Weed, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;Dark orange. big orange and wood hop nose. Strong pale malts with some astringent hop syrup flavors. Not much to taste behind the hop orgy, though. Some Belgian-like yeast perhaps.

Mt. Shasta Abner Weed Amber Ale;Weed, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;22. This is a rock-solid little amber. Pours a clear dark amber with a loose light gray head that doesn�t stick around. Pleasant toasty dark malt and caramel nose with a little bit of gingerbread. Creamy medium body with lively carb.

Mt. Shasta Mountain High IPA;Weed, California, United States;IPA;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;Bottle at home in Salisbury. Pours mostly clear, rich gold with a frothy, off-white head. The aroma is a little awkward, with strong grass and pine, along with suggestions of cocoa and earth. Medium sweet flavor with pale, somewhat bready malts, hints of toffee and cocoa, some bitter toasted grass and earth, grains, citrus rind. Medium bodied with fine to average carbonation. Finishes with more earthy, herbal hops, toasted grains, bread, orange rind. Novel but not entirely coherent.
Mt. Shasta Mountain High IPA;Weed, California, United States;IPA;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;"""(Backlog) The Centennial and Simcoe combination is a nice one, otherwise a pretty average IPA accross the board. Medium flavor, medium bitterness, ibus, sweetness, abv. Nothing jumps out at you, for better or worse."""
Mt. Shasta Mountain High IPA;Weed, California, United States;IPA;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;On tap at The Weed Alehouse / Mt Shasta Brewing, pours a crystal clear golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out syrupy caramel and floral hops - hints at a cloyer. Flavour is very over-malted, bringing out syrupy sweet caramel malt and restrained floral hops. Way too much malt here, giving out a cloyingly sweet mouthfeel. Not a good IPA.
Mt. Shasta Mountain High IPA;Weed, California, United States;IPA;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;Pours a thin head on a hazy straw colored body. The aroma is a nice lemon and roasted malt mixture. The taste is a moderate pine bitterness, sweet candy, then a moderate bitter lemon finish. The texture is crisp with moderate carbonation. An enjoyable IPA with some bold flavors.
Mt. Shasta Mountain High IPA;Weed, California, United States;IPA;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;Easy-breezy IPA, which borders on an extra pale ale. Nice full-flavored maltiness, and an equally nice flavor infusion of pine and floral notes from the hops. Just good tasting all the way around. Ends bitter, which is the only indication really that you're drinking an IPA as opposed to an EPA. Good. B ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Mt. Shasta Mountain High IPA;Weed, California, United States;IPA;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;Bottle. Citrus, caramel and tropical fruit. Mild bitterness throughout. Finish is resiny and a bit sweet.
Mt. Shasta Mountain High IPA;Weed, California, United States;IPA;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;355ml bottle pours a brownish orange color with a finger of white head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is caramel and light citrus. Taste is an earthy and light citrus bitterness with a caramel malty backbone. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation leaving a nice sensation on the palate. A decent IPA that is highly recommended.
Ridgeway The Rose And Crown Ale;North Heath, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ridgeway Brewing;Bottle. A lighter and nastier version of the Nags Head beer by Ridgeway. Keg beer in a bottle.
Ridgeway Nags Head Ale;North Heath, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ridgeway Brewing;Bottle. Orange amber. Stale malt and hops. Hard mouthfeel. Thin. Stewed hops finish.
Shepherd Neame Stage Door Special;Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;Dartford Fest. Gravity. And bright bottled. The Stage Door is a pub in Dartford. Exactly what Sheps or the Stage Door pub do to this beer to make it special is a mystery. It�s hoppy like the Master Brew, but much more malty. It�s not as hoppy as the Jack... The closest beer in the Sheps portfolio is perhaps the Best Bitter (only available in a very few pubs). Whatever it is, it�s very tasty. Malty and tangily bitter. Punches well above its weight.
Shepherd Neame Stage Door Special;Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;Cask@Dartford BF. Sweetish and sticky to begin, some toffee and raisin. Hops also lend a bit too the sticktness. Reasonable balance though.
Shepherd Neame Stage Door Special;Faversham, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shepherd Neame;Beer # 38 at Dartford Beer Festival with SilkTork and Duff. Shepherd Neame doesn�t usually go in for special brews, so it was interesting to be able to try this one. I have no idea why they brewed this, but it did not seem to have been produced specially for this festival. Pale copper colour. Soft malt and some tangy hops in the aroma. The flavours were much the same. Less hoppy than many Shepherd Neame beers, but well balanced. Clean, dry finish. Mouthfeel was a bit thin. A pretty decent beer. Cask (gravity dispense)
Great Waters LEtoile Du Nord;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Great Waters Brewing;Hazy Orange Coloring. Small White Head...A Good Amount of Yeast and some Spice...A Harsher Spice... Not a Great Belgian, But Very Average... Definitly Drinkable.
Great Waters LEtoile Du Nord;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Great Waters Brewing;Orange-Brownish color with a very thin head. Aroma of yeast and spice with alcohol rubbed in. The taste was surprisingly sweet at the start. Some kind of acidic fruit makes its presense known... apple? Likely pear. More yeast and bread along with alcohol. Oddly enough, the 9% didn�t really hit me. I�ve had lower ABV beers that burn much more than this. Light carbonation and a medium mouthfeel. Not the world�s greatest, but quite a fine tasting brew!
Great Waters LEtoile Du Nord;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Great Waters Brewing;On-tap at the brewpub - served in a 10oz snifter - Hazy Iced-tea brown in color, medium, firm, thickly stacked and frothy beige head, diminishes slowly down to a fluffy collar and spotty belgian lacing. One beautiful looking little glass of ale! Aroma is quite yeasty and spicy, partial bubble gum and white/green grape skins in a fruity melange over the top of some phenolic alcohol notes. Taste is a bit like a white wine, dry, but more spicy, good chunk of yeasty spices, clove and white pepper, full on white/green grapeyness mixed with ripe pear. Texture is much like a pear too, fluffy, tongue tingly drying and coating quality with a nice pale malt sweet breadyness behind it all. Feel is about medium with a fluffy texture and carbonation, solid little drying effects that coat the palate well. A fine example of the style and perhaps one of the better ales to have graced the taps at GW. The 9% slows ya down and makes you enjoy its softer, dryer qualities. Much anticipated and much enjoyable. The barkeep says its still young yet, but as is, its actually pretty darn solid. It may improve slightly as it goes and I�ll be willing to find out if it does.
Iron Hill Dortmunder;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Iron Hill West Chester;Pale yellow pour with aroma of citrus and grain. Sweet malt flavor with citrus, caramel, and some grain. Decent summer beer.

Iron Hill Dortmunder;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Iron Hill West Chester;Tap at Voorhees. Beautiful floral nose right away, floating lacing white head. Just awesome noble hops in the mouth, clean, crisp, medium body, nailed the body/feel, very faint chalky bit, little touches of grain and sunshine. Nice and subtle spice as if some rye, perhaps form yeast. Also avoids the occasional mistake of metallic character I often found in authentic German beers of this type. Superb.
Iron Hill Dortmunder;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Iron Hill West Chester;Tap at IHP. Pours gold with minimal white head. Nose was dortmunder malts, mild hopcitrus. Tasted medium in heft and complexity, with a pale malty flavor, some late hops, and late grainy notes.

Gale's Prize Old Ale Special Reserve;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Gales;Vinous aroma while the appearance is dark amber and cloudy with no head. The flavor is fruity with a mild charcoal/smoked malt aspect to it. Very good old ale, the 1996.
Gale's Prize Old Ale Special Reserve;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Gales;Thanks Jason! Sampled side by side a 1996 vintage regular beer. The beer pours to a murky brown body with no head. The aroma is Calvados with apples and light cinnamon and caramel. The flavor is malty, caramel, vanilla, Calvados... surprisingly less like Calvados than the regular 1996 (14 year old). The palate is medium bodied with an easy to drink alcohol content.
Gale's Prize Old Ale Special Reserve;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Gales;2003 bottle, opened with a mild pfft. Poured murky medium-deeper brown with nothing sticking around for head. The aroma was similar to the regular �96 bottle I just drank, with apple wood, calvados, and a little port wine over some bready malts.. didn�t have the same pop as the old one. The flavor found aged caramel, bready notes, and a touch of molasses at the core.. some calvados and oak around, but not all that much.. finished tart with apple and oak. Medium-bodied with very low carbonation on the palate.. OK use of the barrel, but it didn�t really need it, it just needed age.
Gale's Prize Old Ale Special Reserve;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Gales;375, capped and foiled with a heavy foil. Pours a crystal clear but dark and ruddied medium amber. Loose bubbly off-white head. Big vinous nose, balsamic and strawberries there as well. Watery medium body, a little bit sugar-sticky in spots. Shortbread, treacle, figs, raisins and dates on the mid-palate. Long sticky sweet finish.
Gale's Prize Old Ale Special Reserve;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Gales;cloudy brown pour, no head. aromas of raisins, apples, sherry wine and some caramel. Flavor is sweet and malty. Some apples, raisins and sherry notes. No sourness or oxidation to speak of. Pretty nice little sipper.
Gale's Prize Old Ale Special Reserve;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Gales;"I can�t believe I purchased this bottle just yesterday. A 2003 vintage. The cork was still entirely intact and had a pleasant boozy-apple smell to it. Poured completely still, no head just a couple bubbles, into an oversized wine glass. Chestnut colored. There is a lot going on in the nose of this one: fig, dates, raisin, brown sugar, rum. The taste is medium sweet with some alcohol burn. Notes of brown sugar, over-ripe apple, raisin. I must have gotten lucky and got one of the ""good"" bottles, not sour at all. Not my usual type of thing but very interesting."
Gale's Prize Old Ale Special Reserve;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Gales;I like this style, normally. This 6-year old possessed but a small bubble for a head. It looked like an old ale, chestnut and on the thick side. It smelled a bit boozy, apple cidery. The taste was old ale of splinter wood and years gone past.Found at Premiere Gourmet.At best a sipper.
Gale's Prize Old Ale Special Reserve;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Gales;2003 bottle, thanks to WeeHeavySD for sharing. Pours a hazy, muddy, dark brown with no real head. Huge apple aroma, with a lot of spices, like a good apple cider, with a hint of booze and malt. Huge sweet malt taste, with apples and alcohol. Lingering richness. Fantastic, like sipping a great liqueur.
Gale's Prize Old Ale Special Reserve;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Gales;"Beautiful deep light chestnut body with a very slight haze, big bubbled off white lasting head (A prime example of what this kind of beer should look like); Amazing nose, the barrels gives the usual Prize Old Ale notes the final and perfect touch, an amazingly deep super balanced mix of caramel, fruits accompanied by a barrel warmth, amazing; Amazing body too, super soft velvet texture, very very little sharp carbonation biting the tip of your tongue, amazingly complex and perfectly balanced, a perfect salt sweet touch; It finishes a very little to short, the only not perfect part of this beer, superb balance in both aromas and texture, alcohol bite from the Calvados barrels is very well fitting and perfectly balanced. This is a prime example of what barrels can do to a beer, something every other brewer playing with barrels could learn from. Why is this style of beer disappering? I don�t know what this world is coming to!!!"
Gale's Prize Old Ale Special Reserve;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Gales;Little bottle via trade, 2003 vintage. Shared with dalekliz, I had mixed feelings about the other beer. Dark Molasses color no head. Nose is sweet with some apple and oak. Taste is sweet syrupy and quite boozy. Really interesting not as vile or scary as the other version.
Broughton Summer Ale;Biggar, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Broughton Ales;Tasted this in the Tappit Hen, Dunblane on the 15th February 2019. Cask, handpump dispense, 1/2 pint sampled. Clear pale amber in colour with a thin white head. Slight hoppy aroma with floral notes. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt delivers a light biscuit malt base with notes of juicy tart gooseberry fruit. Aftertaste gives a light floral tone to the dusty hop resins, dry in the mouth. Finish is hoppy and resins bitter in the palate with juicy gooseberry pith still about evident. A light refreshing ale for hot summer days - so why am I drinking this in February?
Broughton Summer Ale;Biggar, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Broughton Ales;On cask at Teuchters. Appearance - golden amber with a decent head. Nose - mixture of citrus and meadow flowers. Nice.

Doghouse Dozey Dawg;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Doghouse Brewery (Cornwall);The crown, Nuneaton. Misty straw pint. Citrussy hops, soapy satsuma, a gnaw of pencilly oats. Alright but nothing more.
Doghouse Dozey Dawg;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Doghouse Brewery (Cornwall);Bottle. It was hard going drinking this one. Massive head that exploded on pouing.Slightly cloudy with a sourness that made it difficult to drink. This is one of the reasons why people drink Euro Fizz!

Fant�me Flop!;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;Bottle opened at Fantome-a-thon 2018. I was worried about the cork as there was some liquid between the cork and cap but the cork came out in one piece and there was lots of carbonation. Deep orange, a bit hazy, tall head. Unfortunately its corked and oxidized. Lots of cardboard and cork, a touch of cherry and bitterness. Theres a crazy strong aroma of caramel coming from the bottle. Glad I got to try this but its not worth tracking down at this point.
Fant�me Flop!;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;Reviewed from notes. Sampled at the DC tasting thanks to stakem. 2000 vintage that pours a slightly hazy orange color with a small ring of foam around the glass. Nose is definitely a mixture of mustiness and oxidation. There is surprisingly little oxidation once tasting this though. The flavor is surprisingly bretty for a 16 year old beer, with some backing straw and floral notes. Light mouthfeel with light carbonation. Very good to try this ghost, thanks a bunch Adam!
Fant�me Flop!;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fant�me;Bottle shared by Stakem. Thank you, sir. Light golden / amber body with a thin, off-white collar. Lovely aroma and flavor of well water, funk, mineral, earth. Age has served this beer well.

Dieu du Ciel! Barbichette;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Copper apperance. Fully diminishing off-white cover. Intense earthy and fruity centennial nose: a creamy orange, a living grapefruit, mature lemongrass, pinneaple... Rather intense mouth presence, fruity, lemony. Light acidity, big slicing bitterness. Creamy texture, very soft mouthfeel. Well structured malt base match the centennial to my great pleasure. Cask version was just too smooth and may not have been as fresh as it deserved ( ~ .5 less)
Dieu du Ciel! Barbichette;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Too bad I missed the cask version. Nose of American style hops, with sweet malt, nicely balanced. The flavour is not too strong, not the grapefruit juice quality I might have expected. Nicely bittered and balanced. A good beer that does its job well. Draught.
Dieu du Ciel! Barbichette;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Caramel malt and sweet pineapple cake enrich the Gargantuan citrusy, resinous hops (this is 100% Centennial btw)...Perfect balance and sensual body propagate the marvelous, earthy hoppiness...The cask version of course is smoother, creamier and as balanced as the regular tap version, but its flavors are a tad less intense...A pint full of riches, decadence and subtleties which I wish they will brew often...
Dieu du Ciel! Barbichette;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Spicy, pine-scented oranges - very aromatic Centennial hops dominate the nose. Clear, deep amber-brown with decent off-white head that diminishes to ring. Pine and orange hop flavour with strong malty sweet base. Carbonation level is perfect. Medium body and very drinakable. An excellent strong flavoured but very enjoyable beer. Nice to isolate the single hop variety also. On tap at the brewpub.
Brunswick Pilsner;Derby, Derbyshire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brunswick Brewing Co.;Cask (handpump), Brunswick Inn, Derby, July 2005. This didn�t really come off at all. Very dry. Not much aroma, not much flavour. Hard to drink. Seemed very tired. I wonder whether this cask was on its last legs. I might be wrong, but I suspect this is one of those beers that may use lager malts and German hops but is otherwise just a top fermented ale.
Brunswick Pilsner;Derby, Derbyshire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brunswick Brewing Co.;Cask conditioned - handpump - Brunswick Derby. A very pale coloured beer with a hint of lime green when held to the light. Served as a cask beer with no sparkler, and looking quite dead in the glass. The aroma is pretty hard to find, being quite watery with only a hint of grassy hop. The taste is dry and thin but otherwise non-descript and very disappointing.
Brunswick Pilsner;Derby, Derbyshire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brunswick Brewing Co.;Cask at Leicester Beer Fest 05. Yellow and gold with a white head. Aromas are butter and spices with pear and sweet hops. Flavours are smooth and buttery malts with some hops spice. Has an addictive saltiness. Not really a pilsner at all, but forgivable (just) in this case.
Brunswick Pilsner;Derby, Derbyshire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brunswick Brewing Co.;Cask@Leicester Beer Festival. Pale lager with a very light and fruity aroma. The flavour is like a pale ale with a sightly weak finish. Overall a good version of an English Pilsner.
Brunswick Pilsner;Derby, Derbyshire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brunswick Brewing Co.;Garvity at Derby Beer Festival. Pale gold body, weak aroma. Redeemed by a fantastic fruity flavour, those juicy fruit sugars (melon, banana) held in a well balanced palate. A worthy debutant.
Edale Golden Ghost;Hope Valley, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Edale Brewery;"Hand pull; first brewed for the Derby Beer Festival. Clear golden body, starts bland but has a lovely understated hoppy hint and sherbert dip dryness."
Tower Spirirt of Ecstasy;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tower Brewery;"Hand pull; brewed first for Derby Beer Festival. Watery and thin, a hint of summer fruits with a thin hoppy finish."
Falstaff Doc Holliday;Derby, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Falstaff Brewery;Cask at Babington Arms (JDW) Derby. Another of the Falstaff�s �Spaghetti Western� beers, this is a robust and heady brew that has a sharp aroma and dark brooding looks that suggest a stronger ale. A good chewy beer that�s surprisingly smooth.
Falstaff Radiator;Derby, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Falstaff Brewery;Hand pull at the Derby Beer Festival. Cask beer of the festival for me. Fruity, hoppy, silky smooth, lovely long finish. This ran out too soon, a mark of its popularity. Top stuff.
Church End Avon Ale;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Church End Brewery;Golden amber takeout from the tap. Musty fresh hop aroma. Grainy and straightforwardly hoppy for CE, with no obvious citrus notes (Bramling Cross), but a healthy punch of bitterness. Full-bodied and oaty at the ABV. The customarily biscuity afters. Flavour-packed sessions lacking the spikiness of The Goat. Uncomplicated hoppy beer like a N.German pils with added body.

Aroma of cardboard, pale malt, caster sugar and a bit of an unfinished wortiness. Light-bodied; Pale malt flavour with no signs of caramel at all.

Brewers Premium Shaggy Ale;Mt Maunganui, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;Brewers Bar;On tap @ Brewers Bar. Clear dark amber coppery hue with pretty much no head or lacing. While we were there they were cooking up a batch of malt and so the wonderful strong malt aromas in the air were almost a bit much to rate this beers aromas! - strong toffee, malt, fruity hop, light chocolate. Moderate to moderate heavy sweet, at least moderately bitter, long duration, no saltiness that was in the Pilsener. Medium to full body, chewy sticky texture, soft carbonation. Nice but by the end of the glass almost got to be a bit too much - possibly a bit sweet.

There�s some buttery malt flavour and notes of mashed apples. It has the same filling, yet watery mouthfeel as their Oatmeal Stout. There�s some grassy hops that leads to a sharp resiny finish. Not very good.

Gunnison Westring Ironman Lager;Gunnison, Colorado, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Gunnison Brewery;Draft at the brewery. Pretty darn good for a pale lager, and pretty darn good for this brewery, for that matter. Pours a rich gold, moderate head. Nice full malt profile, gently sweet, chewy cookie flavors, backed up with a solid hop finish, more punch there than in their ESB, curiously enough. A perfectly nice lager.
Gunnison Westring Ironman Lager;Gunnison, Colorado, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Gunnison Brewery;Bright yellow/gold sparkling body topped with a short white head, good lacing. This was light and crisp, sweet malts with a hint of sugar, spicy at the back with a dry hoppy finish.

Blue Corn Golden Maysa;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Corn Cafe & Brewery (Albuquerque);tap at brewpub-pours pale yellow with a small white head. sweet, spicy hop aroma with some earthy engiish hop notes. I detect german hop presence here, but its apparently not in this brew. medium body, good for this style. There are lots of hops in this brew, creating a very earthy presence. I do taste fresh grain along with the hops and becomes stronger as the brew warms. This tastes like a pilsener mixed with a golden ale. I hope Ted wins an award at the GABF with this one!
Blue Corn Golden Maysa;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Corn Cafe & Brewery (Albuquerque);Pale-straw color and very mild carbonation. Subtle, enticing aroma of pale malts, a hint of buttery nuts, and nice delicate English hops. Flavor is almost cologne-like, not a musky yeast thing, but more from the spicy pungency of prominent woody, herbal hops combined with lightly toasted sweet malts. Finish has some citrus acidity which does become a little cloying like lemon tea, but the beer is practically gone by that point. Soft, pleasing body. This is a good summer beer, that unlike so many castrated beers of this or similar styles, still carries some cojones.
Northampton Raspberry Weizen;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Northampton Brewery (MA);The beer pours somehwat cloudy golden. The fruit shows on the nose and palate quite nicely but the bitterness seems ot peak at the wrong time, driving out the nice fruit flavor.
Northampton Raspberry Weizen;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Northampton Brewery (MA);"Sample at the brewpub. Very very clear golden, no head. Fresh but weak unripe raspberry aroma, bit acidic. Hints of biscuit in the malty, bready body, sour raspberry tones; too fizzy."
Northampton Raspberry Weizen;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Northampton Brewery (MA);Draught: The beer was a clear golden color. There was no head or lacing associated with it. The aroma was pretty much overwhelmed by the raspberries. Nothing else got through, although the aroma itself was not overwhelming. The taste was raspberries, with a little wheat. This was basically the Weizenheimer with raspberry flavoring.
Gunnison Sagehorn Stout;Gunnison, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Gunnison Brewery;We found this brewpub by accident during our vacation. We were walking down the main street of Gunnison, looking for a place to eat lunch and there it was, a small brewpub that probably seats 40 people at most. This stout was pretty good. Black, but thin looking, light brown head, good lacing. Smelled roasty and sweet. Body was thinner - made it easy to drink. Tasted sweet up front but was soon overtaken by a strong hoppiness and a very dry finish (with a little sourness, too).
Gunnison Sky High Summer Ale;Gunnison, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Gunnison Brewery;Pale yellow, short head, no lacing - this one wasn�t much to look at! At least the aroma/flavors were good - fresh hop aroma, thin bready malts with a streak of hops down the center of my tongue. Finished with a lingering bitterness.
Copper Tank Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Gotta love the Belgian Abbey six degree in a brewpub!! Even though I had a Westy 6 in the Delirium Cafe in May, this brings back memories. On draught with an amber color. It finished a bit low for a six degree but the candi sugar leaves it tasting just about right. This is a great attempt at Rochefort 6. It�s not as hoppy but Erik will probably tweek it at some point when he brews it again.

Bright, coppery red; big, dry piny nose; bitter initial flavor with a mite of apricot fruitiness ending, light vanilla-caramel maltiness. Dry overall and not extremely exciting, but fairly well-made. 6/3/5/3/12 2.9 March 2005: this year�s is much fruitier, wetter, with a nice full pungent body...closer to an IPA I think, but a very good pint at any rate."
Three Needs Oatmeal Stout;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Pours a nearly opaque dark mahogany with a thin, wispy-lacing light tan head.

Alchemist Zommer Bier;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Alchemist;12 oz at the brewpub. Belgian-style? I got no Belgian characteristics at all. To me this was a simple, straightforward Amber ale, dark and translucent, sweetly malty light aroma, with a light smokiness and perhaps a bit of lemonpeel. Pretty ordinary.

Pours a clear gold-amber with medium, quickly-dissipating, loose and patchy off-white head. Medium-low intensity nose with peat smoke, soda bread and a little plasticine, with a slightly metallic tinge. To taste: a light biscuity sweetness is enveloped by a medium smokiness on the top of the tongue, which complements an overall medium-light bitterness. Light-medium bodied with quite a thin, foamy texture. Carbonation is medium-low and the finish is short and gently bitter. A nice peaty smokiness is let down by the bitter base, which is watery and insipid.

Kingston Glace Bay Ale;Kingston, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kingston Brewing Co.;(Cask Conditioned) Pours a orange body and a yellow head. Caramel malt with slight sour undertones in the nose. The flavour, however, gives great evidence that this beer may have soured - its very astringent.

Rinku�kiai Bir�ieciu Stiprusis;Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;Rinku�kiai;1L bottle (Bar next to Vilnius bus station - to take home) BB20110930, Drunk 20111105 7 Massively fruity ESL esters, raisins and cranberry, but very woody too. 3 Slightly hazy brownish orange, loose tiny head. 7 This is like a barley wine. Lovely and woody and fruity. No hint of 8% at all. This has survived its BB very well. 4- Slightly thin palate, very low carbonation. Beautifully woody finish, so much like an English barley wine. 14 So ale-like with its full estery components. Probably the best stiprusis I�ve had.
Rinku�kiai Bir�ieciu Stiprusis;Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;Rinku�kiai;Lucky drinker�s at Ray�s in Kent - another odd Lithuanian ale! I could tell that Kyle was quite thrilled to bring out a couple of new beers that I hadn�t tried yet. This was a surprise - thought it might be a porter from what we could read of the label. Poured dark amber brown, mostly clear with some decent head and lacing. Interesting combination of caramel / burnt sugar, and a roasty hoppy finish. Traditional ale? - sure, it�d be hard to classify it as anything else!

Hereford & Hops Get Down Brown;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a deep copper/amber color with a fairly thick off white foamy head that left some light stringy lace. The aroma had some roasted nuts, light toffee, subtle caramel and then some floral hops. The flavor was basically the same with a fairly creamy sort of malty aftertaste running into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to almost medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt fine. Overall, pretty good brown worthy of having again.
Hereford & Hops Get Down Brown;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;"On draught at the brewpub in Wausau, Wisconsin as ""Better Brown Ale"". Pours a clear, dark copper amber with a thick and creamy off white head that has good retention and excellent lacing. Aroma of dark, roasted caramel malt, a touch of chocolate, toffee and some flowery hops. Taste is smooth, creamy, medium bodied with some light carbonation. Flavors detected include dark roasted caramel malt, a touch of honey and some milk chocolate. Finish is semi-sweet, silky with a light toasted caramel flavor. A major improvement from their Brown Trout Ale from last year."
Hereford & Hops Get Down Brown;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Poured from growler, courtesy of Naka from the Cranberry stie. Rich chocolate with coffee grounds, roasted nutty character, mild caramel. Tea leaves with mild fruity tang. Dark brown black clear, more like a porter in color, with thin head. Medium heavy body with light carbonation, though the latter is most likely due to travel. Starts rich with grainy acidic coffee notes, mild chocolate, and astringent malt sweetness. Quite a good dose of hop bitterness comes in quick, leaving a strong tea-like bitter coating on the tongue. Mild fruity tang and tobacco finish with dry nutty bitter after. Not quite the brown ale I�m used to, that�s for sure.
Hereford & Hops Get Down Brown;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Growler pour courtesy of �Naka. Pours porter-esque black/brown with dancing hues of red/amber. Roasty, old coffee nose that lingers to a brown sugar/molassas finish. Big roasty flavor with a sweet maltiness up front. Bleeds to said roastiness and then onto a stronger than usual hop finish that reminds me of bitter coffee with Kahlua minus the chocolate. Ok, that makes no sense, but whatever. Honestly is more of a Porter than anything. At any rate, this is a mighty tasty beer.
Hereford & Hops Get Down Brown;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Had this at the Cranberry, PA site. It poured darker than a lot of brown ales I�ve had before. Had very little head and I couldn�t make out the color because of the usual dark bar lighting. Started with a good roasted malt character, though not as much as your typical brown. Finishes with a great hopped flavor that I�ve never found in a brown before. It is one of my favorite browns I�ve tried, but that may just be because it�s got 10 x the hops.
Hereford & Hops Get Down Brown;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Sampled on draft at the Cranberry Twp PA location this beer poured a medium brown color with a small tan head. The aroma is sweet floral hops - stronger than is typical for this style yet fairly pleasant. The flavor is roasty malts, light floral hops and moderate fruity hops. The hops linger on the palate. Hoppier than a typical brown and I found this served the beer well. Was the pick of the litter of the non-seasonals.
Hereford & Hops Get Down Brown;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Somewhat faint, roasted malt aroma with sweetness and moderate hops. Clear reddish in color. Thin, off-white head. Good lace. Thinnish flavor, but nice. Enjoyable. Somewhat dry and somky. Some low to moderate hops. At first sip, I wasn�t overly enamored of Get Down Brown, and in my mind compared it unfavorably to H&H�s Schwarzbier. However, I followed the Get Down Brown with the Schwarzbier in this sitting and enjoyed the Brown more. Imminently drinkable.
Westons Cider with Ginger;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;Pale straw colour with no lacing. Aroma is of very light ginger with very little in the way of apple character. Lightly spicy with a little bit of ginger heat. Pretty simple stuff really
Westons Cider with Ginger;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;Bottle, from Sainsbury�s. Straw coloured, no head and moderate condition. Vague shittiness to start in the nose with a developing gingery spiciness and very little apple character noticable. In the mouth it is soft and sweet with some citric notes (but no apple) and a gentle gingery edge. Dry and spicy in the finish with a overdue hint of apples right at the end. Pointless.
McKenzie Raspberry Wheat;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McKenzie Brew House;I wasnt a big fan on this one. The raspberry itself was authentic and delicious, but I dont think the wit part of the brew was too swift. Some sunscreen and sulfur notes.
McKenzie Raspberry Wheat;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McKenzie Brew House;Magenta, very red, suspected at first food coloring was involved, but it�s pure raspberry. Nose has lots of raspberry, fruity and tart, bit sour, quite nice. Flavor is simply loaded with raspberry flavors, fruity and punchy, tart and sweet. Was so fresh and authentic I kept expecting to chew on the fruit seeds. Nice palate as well, sticky and creamy. Every brewer who makes a generic raspberry wheat beer should go to McKenzie�s for lessons. Damn good stuff.
McKenzie Raspberry Wheat;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McKenzie Brew House;Large pink head, good retention and lace. Hazy pink color. Pleasent berry nose, mild. Light bodied, good carbonation. Mild berry flavor, lightly acidic with some wheat malt notes in the background. Finish is dry, tart. The ABV is well hidden for such a light brew.
Dunn Plowman Golden Haze;Kington,, Herefordshire, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dunn Plowman Brewery;Slightly hazy orange beer, no head to speak of. OUCH! Smells like sewage water. When pouring the second half of the bottle, it is pure sewage - and worse. I cannot believe this is really meant to taste like it does. If any idea comes up, it�s the taste of the water I used to wash my water-colour brushes in as a child. This is beyond brewing faults. Something has completely gone wrong. Palate: well, I must confess 2 sips was all I dared. Hmmm. Judgement suspended, of course. Still, the marks stand, as this bottle ought have never hit the shelves.
Dunn Plowman Golden Haze;Kington,, Herefordshire, England;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dunn Plowman Brewery;The name sums this beer up entirely accurately. Not very wheaty and I can�t say I noticed the coriander and orange too much either. However, it is a lemony and slightly tart, clean and crisp beer. Refreshing, and it does that perfectly well, but a little one dimensional. Not one of Dunn Plowman�s more interesting efforts. 500ml bottle (bottle conditioned) from orchard-hive-and-vine.co.uk. BBE 31 July 2004.

Little Apple Pony Express Porter;Manhattan, Kansas, United States;Porter;Little Apple Brewing Co.;pours black brown with khaki head.smells of chocolate, heavy roast for porter.

Little Apple Pony Express Porter;Manhattan, Kansas, United States;Porter;Little Apple Brewing Co.;Well it is black in color but it is a watery looking black.

Little Apple Pony Express Porter;Manhattan, Kansas, United States;Porter;Little Apple Brewing Co.;A dark brown body, tan head and good lacing. Aroma was lighty roasty and sweet.

Little Apple Fort Riley Rye;Manhattan, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Little Apple Brewing Co.;Looks OK in the glass, bright golden color, well carbonated and decent head formation. Noticeably sweet on the nose and tastes very sweet too. Cardboard lieke dryness in the finish spoils and sours a little but remains sweet and even sugarry in the aftertaste. Pretty much run of the mill lager
Little Apple Fort Riley Rye;Manhattan, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Little Apple Brewing Co.;Tap from Little Apple Brew Pub, dark red, small head, more carbonation than their other brews, slightly twangy, not particularly complex and the finish leaves something to be desired with a slightly thin mouth feel.

Little Apple Fort Riley Rye;Manhattan, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Little Apple Brewing Co.;"Pale gold, short head, o.k. lacing, lots of bubbles. Smells like bread (not much rye in the aroma). Starts with a burst of prickly carbonation, but becomes smoother after a few sips. Bready malts with a rye bite at the end; slighly hoppy. A good ""sandwich beer"""
Little Apple Rileys Red Ale;Manhattan, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Little Apple Brewing Co.;Sampler at the brewpub. Full butter diacetyl in the aroma. Less so in the flavor. Seems to be a nice America-Irish Red hybrid hiding under there.

Little Apple Rileys Red Ale;Manhattan, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Little Apple Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a fairly clear copper with no head. The aroma is a muted, burnt caramel with no noticeable hop note. Light-bodied and slick with a lightly dry finish, the flavor follows the nose. It�s a simple, but decent session brew. Reading the other reviews for this beer, it seems to be a true chameleon. Just about every rating seems to be describing a completely different beer.
Little Apple Rileys Red Ale;Manhattan, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Little Apple Brewing Co.;4 oz taster at the brewpub. Pour is orangish brown with no head.

Trout River TroutFest;Springfield, Vermont, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trout River Brewing Company;Sample at the Vermont Brewers Fest. Hmm, one of my least-favorite VT brewers has a new beer. Hmm, should I hope for something like Boneyard, their excellent barleywine, or something like...pretty much everything else. Alas, it ends up the latter. Medium amber-orange, nice malty-sweet nose dominated by vanilla-caramel with a bit of woodiness promises something...flavor doesn�t really deliver, relatively lifeless, woody again, rather dry with enough fruitiness to save it from awfulness and keep it just mediocre.
Little Apple Patriotic Pils;Manhattan, Kansas, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Little Apple Brewing Co.;Smells fresh and floral. Golden and sparkling, msall head, no lacing. Sweet malts are thin in the crisply carbonated body, ending with a light pepper hop and a hint of lemon.

Tyranena Rocky's Revenge Bourbon Brown;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Tyranena Brewing;12 oz. bottle from seeswo. Thanks again, Chris! Pours a clear amber with a very small off-white head that settles into a very thin ring and light wispy film. Notes of toast, nuts, tea, earth, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, and tobacco. Light-bodied, with modest carbonation and a smooth, earthy, lightly sweet mouthfeel. Such a light barrel presence. Thin beer with a quick aging. Wisconsin is good at these. Tyranena specialty.

Smooth flavor, light on the bourbon, some caramel, nuttiness, bread and biscuits. Not bad.

Tyranena Rocky's Revenge Bourbon Brown;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Tyranena Brewing;Lots of flavors coming from everywhere dominant bourbon taste but yet still holds a malty flavor. Smells of sweet and of strong bourbon. NO aftertaste, smooth finish.
Tyranena Rocky's Revenge Bourbon Brown;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Tyranena Brewing;"Poured it out because I couldn't finish it - a ""I can't remember the last time"" event. It poured and smelled great but the flavorings were over powering. If it wasn't fake flavors added then I'm impressed with their aging process potency. However it felt really artificial in flavor. Elements reminded me of Bourbon County in its potency of aroma and palate so I give credit there. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Tyranena Rocky's Revenge Bourbon Brown;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Tyranena Brewing;On tap at Quaker Steak. Cloudy brown pour with an off white head.

Barley Johns Raspberry Amber;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Amber color with no head. Aroma contains little fruit, but more of a general fruit hint as opposed to actual raspberries. Taste is a tad on the malty side. The fruit appears to be fruit flavored syrup instead of actual raspberries added to the mix. It made the beer quite sweet and almost slimy

Bronze w. a very fluffy head & carbonated, bubbly body. Sweet, honeyed malt aroma. Crisp. Nice sweet, honey malt flavor, some fruitiness, perilously drinkable. No off-flavors. Perhaps some caramel. Alcohol content is incredibly well integrated into the beer. Tiny warming character, but no bad ethyl flavors.

Yukon Aroma Borealis Herbal Cream Ale;Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada;Flavored - Other;Yukon Brewing;This beer does not come in small bottles. I wish it did because it�s not that good. The beer pours a golden colour with copper hues, slightly cloudy, with an off-white head. The aroma was sweet malt, bread, yeast, and piney hops. The flavour was atrocious. A little malt and yeast heavy with nothing to back them up.

Taste is...better than expected actually. Sweet, sugariness, complemented by bright herbs. Mint is noticeable. Basically no finish. ""Beer"" character is minimal. Maybe bud light mint is on the way."
Yukon Aroma Borealis Herbal Cream Ale;Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada;Flavored - Other;Yukon Brewing;Pours a clear pale yellow with a small white ring. Not sure if the add series differs from the original but the aroma smells very much of corn but maybe they mimicked this by using the northern herbs. Other aromas are soft malts and a little bit of spiciness from the herbs. Taste is biscuity bready malts, with corn and then finishes with a herbal spiciness. Decent beer on an otherwise boring style.

Light to medium body and little carbonation. All in all just an enjoyable beer.
Yukon Aroma Borealis Herbal Cream Ale;Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada;Flavored - Other;Yukon Brewing;Review is from early winter �07. My problem is that when I review I always do it on the entire bottle..in this case there�s 1 litre of beer to do. Lets drink! The pour gave me a decent sparkly white cap with some ropy lacing. The beer itself was light gold/amber, kind of cloudy and produces an average ammount of carbonation. The aroma is what really makes this beer. Aromatic with what appears to be pine but a bit more medicinal - like a weak Jagermeister. A touch of fruit - close to apricots. Undestinguishable malts. There is also leather and something flowery. Gotta say that the aroma is very complex that really changes ALOT during the consumption of an entire litre. The taste is really medicinal but not over the top (like the Alaskan Winter Ale) . Dry yeast, tons and tons of spices, a healthy ammount of bready malts, possibly apricots and a bitterness that reminds me of some strong belgian dubbels. Medium bodied. Fairly smooth and tangy with an interesting bitterness that fades slowly. I�m not a fan of spiced ales but at least this one isn�t overpowering and that is a very good thing for my enjoyment of the style considering I still have to refill my glass 3 more times. The weak 4.5% has gotten to my brain but that�s probally from the 300 push-ups I did during the review. Good beer - get it before it�s gone.

G�sser Zwickelbier;Leoben, Austria;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;G�sser (Brau Union);On draught at El Gaucho. Apparently this is made for them, but that remains to be seen. The pour is a foggy golden yellow with a thick white head that leaves a meringue style lace behind. The aroma is typical. A good bit of grain, a light malt and a hint of metallic present. Not a lot, but the sweetness kind of exploits it. There is a light citrus rind on the finish that I like. The flavor is just as you�d expect. It�s sweet with a light maltiness and a good citrus backer. There is a hint of metallic in the grains and a touch of yeast. It�s very balanced and easy to drink. The mouth feel is light and clean with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly sweeet grain finish with just the slightest bit of alcohol. This is pretty good.

Porter Sunshine;Haslingden, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Porter Brewing;Cask condition, GBBF 2005. Not hoppy. A strange taste of cork is all over this beer. Quite unpleasant.
Porter Sunshine;Haslingden, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Porter Brewing;This beer IS mainly about the hops, but I didn�t think it was a one-trick pony. There�s quite a fair smattering of pale malt nestling down in the depths of the flavour. It�s an unremarkable amber colour. The aroma has a faint suggestion of green apple to go with the rush of citric hop. The flavour has much more of an oily, resinous hop character with enough bitterness to produce a very assertive feel. Well-defined and well-balanced. The finish is lingering and dry - positively arid in fact. Slightly chalky mouthfeel. I wasn�t convinced by this beer on the first couple of mouthfuls, but it won me over by the end and I found myself even enjoying the very austere dryness.
Porter Sunshine;Haslingden, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Porter Brewing;Golden/orange in colour. Aromas are hoppy and spicy with some sweetness. The flavour is intensely hoppy. To be honest this beer is all hops. Has a very dry finish for good measure. One for the hopheads.

The beer was a solid, mid amber coloured traditional best bitter, with a reasonable balance of malt and hop, and a dry finish. Traces of butterscotch and sulphur on the aroma. Cask (gravity dispense).

Terre Haute Champagne Velvet;Terre Haute, Indiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Terre Haute Brewing Co.;This draft brew poured a small head of finely sized mostly lasting white colored bubbles that left behind a poor lacing. The body contained very soft carbonation, was transparent and yellow in color. Its aroma contained notes of malt hops and was very mild. Its mouth feel is initially tingly with a smooth palate and a hop finish. Its flavor contained grass pilsnerish malty hoppy notes. A slightly below average brew.

Poured a medium to deeper amber color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of vegetables and light caramel in the background. Tastes where way off. Sour and buttery. On my way to the sink...
Terre Haute Velvet Amber;Terre Haute, Indiana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Terre Haute Brewing Co.;Pours very clear amber, with red and brown tones, with a minimal tan head. Aroma is malty, but very sweet and with a fruity vinegar aroma. Smells smooth but vinigar makes it a little off. Flavor is tangy from malt, but has a vinegar flavor that is off putting. Vinegar gives a fruityness but is�s messy and not put together well. The interestering aroma was the best part of it.
Terre Haute Velvet Amber;Terre Haute, Indiana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Terre Haute Brewing Co.;"Body is a medium amber hue. I usually don�t give such vague comments, but the only way to descibe this one is ""weird."" It just didn�t sit well with me."
Terre Haute Velvet Amber;Terre Haute, Indiana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Terre Haute Brewing Co.;Golden lager with a boiled vegetable aroma, and diacetyl. The diacetyl comes out in mouth too, but gets a reprieve from the malts and hops. Apart from the aroma , good lager. (July 31 at Indiana Microbrewers Festival)

Terre Haute Gold Label Bock;Terre Haute, Indiana, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Terre Haute Brewing Co.;12 oz. bottle. Poured a plum red brown with a small, fully lasting, ultra creamy off-white head. Nice lacing. Looks impressive. Aroma of chocolate and raisins - like raisinettes in my beer - with some other nameless sugary malty smells and some light alcohol. Flavor is - eeerreeech! - this is not a bock. This is a sour. Maybe an off bottle, but I�m willing to follow through and see where it goes. Apple cider vinegar and unripe apples, lightly sweet, seriously sour. Still, not unenjoyable, and a surprisingly creamy mouthfeel. Medium bodied. Weird, but good.
Terre Haute Gold Label Bock;Terre Haute, Indiana, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Terre Haute Brewing Co.;This bottled brew poured a medium sized head of mostly diminishing light brown colored fine to medium sized bubbles that left behind a good lacing and a transparent softly carbonated caramel brown colored body. The aroma was sweet with malty hoppy doughy notes. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and mellower in the finish with a thin flavor that was dry semi-sweet and only mildly bock like. There was a slight vinegar note mixed in with the malty base. Overall it left a dry mouth feel once quaffed.
Terre Haute Gold Label Bock;Terre Haute, Indiana, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Terre Haute Brewing Co.;Bottled. This stuff reminds me of Camo, but was $7.99 a sixer. Non existent head. Metallic aftertaste. Very thin and watery. One positive, though, is that the quicker you drink it, the better it tastes.

Terre Haute Gold Label Bock;Terre Haute, Indiana, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Terre Haute Brewing Co.;A bottle from my parent�s home town of Terre Haute, Indiana. Tasted kinda like a newcastle (though I find the taste of newcastle quite inconsistent), though more germanic maltiness. Could�ve had a bit more aroma, but it tasted alright.
Terre Haute Gold Label Bock;Terre Haute, Indiana, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Terre Haute Brewing Co.;Dark, reddish-brown body. Not very aromatic. General malts, slightly sweet and slightly metallic. THe flavor is hard to palate, with its vitamin C-like astringency. Very acidic and very bitter. Could something have been wrong with the brew?
Terre Haute Gold Label Bock;Terre Haute, Indiana, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Terre Haute Brewing Co.;I think my sample may have been a bit off - it had a hearty, thick caramel and chocolate flavor, but it was cut with a major acidic, almost metallic bitterness that certainly didn�t taste like it belonged there - it�s a shame, because this seemed like it could have been a good bock.
Terre Haute Gold Label Bock;Terre Haute, Indiana, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Terre Haute Brewing Co.;"Bottle: Cola borwn hue with a small fizzy lasting head and good lacing. The aroma isn�t too bad, caramel and toasty malts, subdued mocha, grassy and floral hops, and a hint of sour apple. The taste is another thing, starts malty but then a lactic note and vegetable undertone ruins it. The feel is fizzy and weak for something this ""big"". Arrgh I wanted this to be good, but alas, it was a waste of time."
Terre Haute Cvar;Terre Haute, Indiana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Terre Haute Brewing Co.;"This was my favorite beer of my visit to the tap room. Sparkling gold, streams of carbonation rising up to a short white head. FLoral and spicy in the nose. Body is thin yet bright; pale malt flavors, and a very spicy saaz finish that totally dries out. They used a generous amount of hops in this and no adjuncts as far as I could tell."

Main Street German Hefeweizen;Gresham, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Main Street Ale House;Cloudy orange with a very thin head. Chewy-sweet malts were bready.

Main Street German Hefeweizen;Gresham, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Main Street Ale House;Tap. Typical bright orange hazy hefe looking. Prety standard banana clove flavor, but with some extra zing that put it over the top of standard brewpub hefeweizens in my book.
Main Street Oatmeal Stout;Gresham, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Ale House;Deep brown with a cream roasted oat nose. Semi-thick body, good, mild roasted oats... a decent hop bite.

Main Street Oatmeal Stout;Gresham, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Ale House;Very, very dark brown. Smooth and creamy texture, albeit on the light side. Roasty and milky sweetness was really tasty. Notes of coffee with cream. Hints of toasted bread and chocolate. Flavorful.

Main Street Oatmeal Stout;Gresham, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Ale House;Opaque, small head. Nice roasty characteristics: burnt chocolate-coffee, and maybe the mouthfeel could be a LITTLE bit thicker, but this doesn�t earn any demerits. A good specimen of the style.

Shipwrecked Lighthouse Light;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Pale lager??????? Only in mouth feel and appearance ! Over hopped for style. Not sure if bitterness was from hops or from tannins release in high temp mash.
Shipwrecked Lighthouse Light;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Draft Flight 4/26/00 (Brewpub)-Pours golden with a small head. Aroma of grains. Taste of grains, malt, and hops. This light bodied brew is not bad but not good. An OK light brew.
Shipwrecked Lighthouse Light;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;This beer is horrendous. Tap at Shipwrecked. Straight up putrid, unacceptable aroma. Like you aged a Pilsener in your garbage can overnight. Really quite bad, no redeeming qualitites. Amateur hour rip off beer...something the brewers should be ashamed of. Disturbing putrid butter.
Shipwrecked Lighthouse Light;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;"Sampler as part of a flight ""plank"" of the current drafts at the brewpub bar. Poured to plastic with a light, orangy gold color, a modest amount of soft white head foam, and light spots of lacing. The nose was quite light, and what was detectable was light yeast, light grain, a touch of corn, and a very light but still unpleasant, acetic/vinegary hint. The flavor was a little better with moderate hop bitterness, and soft malt. With fair carbonation and a light body, this one didn�t start out well, and was just palateable after that."
Shipwrecked Lighthouse Light;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;On tap at the brewpub, pours a hazy pale orange with no head. Very similar to the Bayside Blonde--corny, sweetly malty--but with a bit more corn. It�s a light beer. Meh.
Shipwrecked Lighthouse Light;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Draft. Little head. Pours a clear light golden color. Very little aroma. Taste is very somiliar to a macro. Slight bitter end. Nothing outstanding.

Poured a clear light golden color. The head consisted of a white ring. Light bodied and dry with biscuity malt and subdued noble hop flavors. So so at best.
Shipwrecked Lighthouse Light;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Not terribly impressed. With the lack of hops (like most lights) this should have been served colder and it may have come across as more refreshing. Gave the impression of flat beer that had been watered down. Sort of like Old Milwaukee with a little more character.
Shipwrecked Lighthouse Light;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Light color with slightly fizzy look. Hops, somewhere. Some yeast. Really? Acidic and bitter. Bland and boring. Nope.

McMenamins Double, Triple Brown;Portland, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Tap. Looks pretty much like a stout, �cept a little bit transluscent on the edges. Actually, it smalls like a stout as well, with some nice roastiness. But the flavor was just too thin and it left me a bit disappointed. Still drinkable though.
Shipwrecked Peninsula Porter;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;12 ounce bottle from Woodman's Green Bay. Clear very dark brown, thin foamy tan head, fair retention.

Shipwrecked Peninsula Porter;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;This pours a thin, dark brown color with little to no carbonation. Aroma is mild with robust caramel tones. The taste is thin, slightly robust and very chalky. Granted this was a old bottle I had laying around so take that at face value but I think it was laying around because I didn�t care for the previous bottles. Much better porter options out in the market place.
Shipwrecked Peninsula Porter;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Bottle. It poured a dark brown color with a light tan head. The aroma was of roasted coffee, caramel and some chocolate. The taste was similar to the aroma with bitter coffee, some chocolate and caramel malts. Nicely done.
Shipwrecked Peninsula Porter;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Pours very dark brown to black with not much of a cream colored head that leaves some stringy ropes of lace that look like the Isle of Man flag. Nose involves roasted malt, some dark chocolate, some milk chocolate, a bit of mustiness, some peppery spice, some meatiness. Decently sweet, lightly bitter. Medium to light bodied, creamy yet a bit watery, softer carb, finishing a bit twangy with milk chocolate and dust. Kind of a weak brew, but my first from Door County, WI, which is pretty cool.
Shipwrecked Peninsula Porter;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Got this beer from a good friend. Got it at the brewery. So I think this is as fresh as it can be. Malty taste, hints of chocolate and coffee. Black as night. Tan flothy head stays a while. A very good beer.

Shipwrecked Peninsula Porter;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Bottle. It poured a translucent brown with a beige head. The aroma was roasted malt and coffee. The flavor was the same with hints of cocoa, roasted nuts and some star anise. The taste was a balance between bitter upfront and sweetness on the end.
Shipwrecked Peninsula Porter;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Pours very black w tan head. Aroma is coffee and malts. Flavor is coffee, some bitterness and coffee. Left chunks at the bottom of my glass.
Shipwrecked Welcome Back Bock;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Deep brown pour with a nice well-retained creamy tan head. Nice lacing as it went down. Aroma picked up roasted barley, caramel, and light hops. Creamy and smooth on the palate with coffee on the finish. Roasty flavor that was coffee-based. Nothing exciting about this one, but it was respectable.
Shipwrecked Welcome Back Bock;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Slight off-white head with no retention. Medium brown slightly hazy beer. No aroma. Taste of roasted barley (?!?) but little malt sweetness or character. More like a brown ale, but nothing like a bock..an American bock ...maybe.
Hinterland Luna Coffee Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Hinterland Brewery;12 oz bottle rating. Dark brown body with minimal off white head. Aroma of dark roast, nut, and chocolate and caramel malts. Very straight forward coffee stout. Hard to say anything negative here. I like coffee beers and this one is well done.
Hinterland Luna Coffee Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Hinterland Brewery;"I liked this a lot, even though the coffee flavor was a little over the top......but I like coffee. More on the bitter coffee side, with the chocolate malts sweetening it up a bit. Mild hop balance. Strong coffee aroma. The bottle says ""malt beverage"", so I'm not sure if this is a true stout as far as the way it is brewed. Worth the try, and would probably sample again."
Hinterland Luna Coffee Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Hinterland Brewery;Bottle with many thanks to Drake! Pours very dark brown with a small beige head. Aroma is cocoa powder, chocolate, coffee, roasted nuts. Flavor is coffee, nuts, chocolate, cocoa, light caramel, salt.
Hinterland Luna Coffee Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Hinterland Brewery;pours black with a smallish brown head. Big coffee aroma and the expected toasted malt. Moderately bitter black coffee taste, again with burnt toasted malt. Pleasant slowly fading bitter coffee finish. Really good!
Hinterland Luna Coffee Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Hinterland Brewery;"12 ounce bottle from Woodman�s in Janesville, WI, served at cellar temp in a Guinness glass. While the color and texture is much like the near-opaque jet of Guinness or any other proper stout, alas the light tan head is soupy and quick-dying; no time to carve a shamrock or a moon in this foam...a touch of brown sugar arises alongside the dark coffee roastiness of the fairly expressive nose; there might be a bit of vanilla here as well but it�s shifty and subtle...on the tongue, surprisingly, no sweetness at all, just a heavy bitter chocolate-coffee roast throughout with a long bitter finish and an unfortunate hint of cardboard...the body could be a little fuller; carbonation a bit on the low side. Overall it�s reasonably well made, and the cardboard notes I mentioned fade over a few minutes of sipping, but I can�t say it really excites, and the fairly one-dimensional bitterness just doesn�t do it for me - if you love dry stouts it may be more up your alley."
Hinterland Luna Coffee Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Hinterland Brewery;Bottle. Pours a very dark brown with small tan head that lasts. The aroma is nuts, roast, cocoa. Medium body, similar flavors to nose, bitter roast finish, good.
Hinterland Luna Coffee Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Hinterland Brewery;Taste: thick, smokey, coffee, roasted bittersweet notes. Coffee bean, caramel malt nose. Very dark brown semi opaque with a dark head of lace with lattice on glass. full but not heavy body.
Hinterland Luna Coffee Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Hinterland Brewery;Packers suck. This beer is good. You get plenty of coffee. Pretty carbonated for the style.
Hinterland Luna Coffee Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Hinterland Brewery;A nice dark brown pour with a finger of creamy head that lasts most of the beer. Coffee, maybe even vanilla on the nose. Full roasty body, bitter coffee, maybe espresso? with a dry finish that lingers.
Hinterland Luna Coffee Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Hinterland Brewery;Pours black with a small brown head. Aroma of dark roast coffee and mocha. Roasty flavors and slightly bitter coffee. Medium body. Better coffee stouts out there.
Harvest Moon Belgian Saison;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);On tap at Harvest Moon. Pours a hazed dark gold with a thin white head. Nice big Belgian yeast notes on the nose, wheat and musk. Big sweet wheat and esters right away. A bit of alcohol comes through, never harsh, but certainly present. Musky and estery, smooth and tasty. Nice bitterness through the finish, more esters and big musky phenolic notes. Nicely done overall.
Harvest Moon Belgian Saison;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);On tap at the Brew Pub as their Lemon Sorachi Saison. Poured a yellow color with an averaged sized head. Aromas of citrus, some floral, and spicy. Rindy and fruity.

Harvest Moon Belgian Saison;New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Harvest Moon Brewery (NJ);First to rate. Wow. This is perhaps the best beer I've had at Harvest. I've never had a Saison before, but I am impressed. I will have to try more of the style. Great light summer beer.

Oettinger Mixed;Oettingen, Bavaria, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Oettinger Bier Gruppe;Sampled from 0.5 l bottle from local 'toom', best before April 2018. Clear, very dark red with a thin, frothy, slowly diminishing, off-white head. Sweetish, slightly sourish and a bit artificial aroma of cola, burnt sugar and some raisins.

Schlossbr�u Pils;Schwalmtal, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Schlossbrauerei H. Leven;Not horrible. Smells a bit like watered down piss, tastes like generic American mass produced with banana undertones.

Schlossbr�u Pils;Schwalmtal, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Schlossbrauerei H. Leven;German standard lager from a brewery that apparently closed its doors meanwhile. Cream white, moussy, sticky head, clear straw blonde robe. Aroma of simple pale malts and faint grassy and floral hops, taste neutral, vaguely malty with mild but brief hop bitterishness in the finish. Just another bland pale lager, I expected more from a German Pilsener.
Schlossbr�u Pils;Schwalmtal, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Schlossbrauerei H. Leven;Bought at Burg brewery in Ermelo. My source says the brewery is closed, but as the brewers name is on the label I�ll stick to above description. Hoppy aroma with some hay and a bit of soap. Firm bitter flavor with some hay and, alas, even some urine on the background. Cardboard aftertaste. Promising pilsener followed by a bitter disappointment in the finish.
Rinku�kiai Uosto Stiprusis (Extra);Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinku�kiai;Bottle from backlog notes. Pours a clear golden color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have pale grainy malt, grass, a slight general fruit, bigger alcohol than the 8%, these are typically messy beers and this is no different.
Rinku�kiai Uosto Stiprusis (Extra);Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinku�kiai;500 ml bottle. 7.5%. BB 13/01/15. (Elisiejus) Salo�iai, Lithuania. Bright golden colour with a small white head. Mild malty aroma with mild sweetness. Surprisingly mild for such a strong brew. The flavour is grassy bitterness, sweetness and malt. Alcohol is lurking everywhere.
Rinku�kiai Uosto Stiprusis (Extra);Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinku�kiai;"500ml bottle (Rinkuskiai Brewery Shop, Lithuania) Sticky heavy nose, more malt liquor than ESL, doesn�t have the sophistication of a proper ESL. Rough in the mouth, metallic hoppy bite. Sticky sweet palate. Not actually boozy, but clearly potent. Few redeeming features; it�s best feature is that it�s not so offensive you feel the need to drainpour it. Hops and alcohol numb you to its flaws, so once you�re half way down, you will finish it."
Rinku�kiai Uosto Stiprusis (Extra);Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinku�kiai;poured golden with no headflavor sweet malts and alcohol nothing else going on
Rinku�kiai Uosto Stiprusis (Extra);Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinku�kiai;Translucent golden orange with good white head that fades quickly to nothing. Sweet and spicy with light citrus and banana. Flavor is similar to all the other euro stong lagers ive had, but this one is more balanced and hides the alcohol nicely. Syrupy body. For a good bit of alcohol, at a reasonable price, there are worse ways you could go, I actually enjoyed sipping on this one.
Rinku�kiai Uosto Stiprusis (Extra);Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinku�kiai;This is a thoroughly mediocre beer. The aroma, the appearance, the flavour, the palate, and the overall impression thoroughly indicate a mediocre beer. The best bit is the amount and the 8% ABV.
Rinku�kiai Uosto Stiprusis (Extra);Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinku�kiai;"First of all, though the back label claims this is a ""stout beer"", it is absolutely not a stout. I imagine this is a problem with translation: possibly they were looking for the English word for ""Strong Beer"", and someone (unacquainted with the actual product, and naturally thinking of Baltic porter, or Imperial Stout) could have suggested ""stout"". A quick look at an English dictionary would show that ""stout"" could mean ""heavy-bodied"", or ""strong and full of character"". Not realizing that these definitions applied to people and not to styles of beer, the Lithuanian Marketing Dept. went ahead with their label designs... at least that�s my guess. As for the beer? Unremarkable lager aroma. Pours clear golden yellow, not too pale, with a credible if short-lived attempt at a head. An initial malty fruitiness soon gives way to a yeasty sugar-syrup flavor. The hops fight valiantly to dry things out a little, but to no avail: the end notes are almost cloyingly sweet. It does hide its 8% alcohol reasonably well: I was thinking the ABV might be a little exaggerated, and then I discovered my nose was gone."

Rinku�kiai Uosto Stiprusis (Extra);Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinku�kiai;I bought this one on a whim because it was on sale and I�ve never had a Lithuanian beer before. Actually a bit better then I thought it would be, but nothing great. The aroma is pretty good, it smells like a good English ale. Taste is a bit similar but it�s not very clean. Quite malty and pretty thick on the palate for a lager. Pours a slightly cloudy copper color with a white head that goes away quickly. Overall it was worth the $1.99 USD.
Rinku�kiai Uosto Stiprusis (Extra);Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinku�kiai;Bottle. Pours a cloudy copper, with a thin watery head and some decent lacing. Aroma of ginger, malty corn, soft chocolate. Flavor is a bit spicy. Ginger, cinnamon, pointless hoppiness, fresh malts, some cider...Very watery and thin-bodied. Slightly bitter finish.

Het Anker Blond;Mechelen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Het Anker;"Elegant thirst-quencher from one of my favorite breweries that has been sold under different names. This rating is based on a 75 cl bottle under its original name Anker Blond; also tasted as Margriet, which is apparently the same beer, but made to celebrate the women that have been in charge of the city of Mechelen throughout history; as the greek Athos version; and as the new Vossen Met De Meynen - too many aliases guys! Egg-white, frothy, lacing, thick head over a cloudy deep golden blonde beer. Aroma of coriander, vanilla, banana liqueur, soap, star aniseed, candied orange, apple cake. Sweetish banana flavour at first but in a �candied� kind of way rather than isoamylacetate, sweet perfumey spiciness obvious from the start (coriander and star aniseed, hint of cura�ao perhaps), fluffy and smooth caramelly malt backbone, retronasal spiciness again (as more or less expected from Anker) not unlike their Easter Beer but a bit less strong, mild herbal hop bitterishness well in balance with the spices, banana flavour lingering a bit. Sweet and spicy is something you have to like in a beer, but in this case, the idea is well executed."
Het Anker Blond;Mechelen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Het Anker;Had it as �Vossen met den Meynen�. Anyway, it�s an average Belgian blond beer. Yeasty, with some fruits and herbs. Nothing too exciting.

Maui Brewing Okakopafest;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Maui Brewing Company;Enjoyed this on tap at the Maui Brewing Company facility in Kapalua in August 2007. Orange color, not overly hoppy or malty. Smooth, refreshing beer, but certainly not the strongest or most distinctive Oktoberfest I�ve ever had.

Maui Brewing Big Swell IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IPA;Maui Brewing Company;This is a backlog rating from�2012 from a can (multiple times), from�notes.�When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time, work and/or family. Words to describe this beer are pale malts, citrus, dank, floral hops, good.
Maui Brewing Big Swell IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IPA;Maui Brewing Company;Clear gold color poured with a white head. The aroma is malty with a nice caramel note along with the hoppiness of grapefruit in the taste. Nice.
Maui Brewing Big Swell IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IPA;Maui Brewing Company;"From a can poured a slightly hazy golden-amber with 2cm of off-white dense foam that retained very well and laced very well. Carbonation high, lively and very fine to fine. Aroma moderately strong of grapefruit and pine. Taste of lots of grapefruit (both fruity and zest) and resinous pine with hints of tropical fruit (pineapple); moderate to strong hoppy bitterness; a 'typical' pre-hazy-style IPA. Medium body. Smooth, crisp, clean and slightly dry with a lingering finish."
Maui Brewing Big Swell IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IPA;Maui Brewing Company;$2 can from vintage estate. A slightly deeper yellow than pale. Big foam y head, more than half of glass is foam, even with a gentle pour. Head goes craggy, unrelenting. Smell is typical rough volatile IPA. First tate is all IPA, bitter nasty resinous mouth coating chewing on green grapefruit rinds mixed with pine tar. What else can be said? Its just another of a million typically ubiquitous IPA that treads into double imperial IPA territory. IPA, the beer with a preservative in it. Rude mah-fah.
Maui Brewing Big Swell IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IPA;Maui Brewing Company;Can in Maui pour avg gold with moderate white head. Nose dank, citrus zest, soap. Taste moderate bitter up front, then flavors from the nose. Of course, the setting helps.

Maui Brewing Big Swell IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IPA;Maui Brewing Company;Can. Pours lightly hazy golden, large fluffy white head, good lacing. Aroma is pine, grapefruit, orange and a bit of dust. Flavor is light sweet, medium bitter. Medium body. Decent
Maui Brewing Big Swell IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IPA;Maui Brewing Company;24-Nov-08 (12-oz can: Purchased 15-Oct-08 for $2.29 at South Bay Drugs and Liquor in Imperial Beach, CA) Hazy, dark-amber in the glass with a frail, wafer-thin head that is off-white in color and quick to dissipate to a thin ring and light dusting. The nose offers gently piney hops and a pale malt backing, but the beer lacks the intensity you might expect from an IPA. The smooth, lightly flavored hops add a nice dryness, but the slightly toasty malts are also on the sweet side. Light in carbonation, medium in body, smooth and easy drinking. Overall, the beer does have nice flavor and excellent balance, but it definitely leaves one with the impression that this is an IPA on training wheels. A good choice for people looking to try an IPA for the first time, someone who doesn't like the West Coast style, or someone who is simply in the mood for an easy drinking hoppy beer.
Maui Brewing Big Swell IPA;Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States;IPA;Maui Brewing Company;12 oz can from a six pack from Tsunami Taproom in Salem OR $10 six.

Rinku�kiai Bir�ieciu Classic;Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;Rinku�kiai;Bottle picked up locally from recent notes. Pours a mostly clear golden amber color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have sweet malts, caramel, again like some of their other beers almost candied sweet, musty character that doesn�t help, oxidation, just nothing very good here.
Rinku�kiai Bir�ieciu Classic;Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;Rinku�kiai;bottle @ Belmont Party Supply / Dayton OH --- Aroma of musty malt and caramel. Cloudy brown, bubbly, watery beige head that soon disappears, a few strips of lace. Taste is watery caramel malt, light fizz, and only alcohol to cover the short finish. An odd brew, because it has a big body, but a thin watery influence is there as well. The alcohol at the end finishes off any chance this has to be acceptable. Not worth your time.
Rinku�kiai Bir�ieciu Classic;Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;Rinku�kiai;Bottle from Tres Bonne Cuisine. Dull, lifeless pour, looks like an iced tea. Deep caramel aroma, with a definite musty character. Caramel is also the dominant flavor, not much else to this, but the malt. On target for the style, but not a good example.
Rinku�kiai Bir�ieciu Classic;Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;Rinku�kiai;Surprising beer, I expected less flavor than this had, though that flavor was mediocre. Lots of sweet caramel and an offputting mustiness.
Rinku�kiai Bir�ieciu Classic;Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;Rinku�kiai;Cloudy, brown with an ice-tea foam top. Bready, oxidized....caramel aroma. Sweet, stale, baked bread....old taste. Nutty, wooden and thick. Not good...very unpleasant.
Rinku�kiai Bir�ieciu Classic;Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;Rinku�kiai;I think this is the right beer, has the same commercial description but a different label. Bottle. Sweet caramel overload in the nose with a surprising sledgehammer of gooey toffee. Pours a transparent red-caramel with no real head. Taste is almost unbearable sweet, thin with a little candy-ish roast, a dirty dirt aftertaste and fills me with the unbearable urge to defecate (from the mouth). Aroma would have gotten about a 5 and appearance about a 2, but man, this is vile stuff, and no beer deserves higher than minimum if I can�t force down more than an ounce.
Rinku�kiai Bir�ieciu Classic;Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;Rinku�kiai;Bottle. Pours orangey amber with a medium, large-bubbled head. Aroma and flavor are caramel, very sweet (even harshly so), a bit of fruit -- that�s about it. I�m trying to like this beer for its malty character, but the industrial strength sweetness is limiting my enjoyment. Viscous palate.
Rinku�kiai Bir�ieciu Classic;Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;Rinku�kiai;Pours a rich amber brew with a crisp, off-white head. Light orange hue. Malty aroma with outlying dusted cider wood. Interesting malted complexity in aroma and flavor. Warming. Some nuttiness and brown sugar on the palate with hints of wood and cider. Dusty, old-barrel-aged quality. Candi caramel on the finish too. A sturdy wintere brew. Well-made, distinctly-flavored offering.
Rinku�kiai Bir�ieciu Classic;Bir�u raj., Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;Rinku�kiai;Lightly hazed copper color with only a thin lid of off-white bubbles. Savory malt, caramel, toffee and dark maple syrup and buckwheat pancake aromas. Deep malt scents with additional peat and iodine. Just too much candy in the nose for me. Sweet flavors from the start. Brown sugar and light candied fruit attack. Finish has a bit of herbal hops and oak. I can see this being a traditional ale, sweet and high in alcohol.
Dalitas Tarano;Bir�ai, Lithuania;Traditional Ale - Other;Dalitas;Golden copper. Deep toffee and a hint of caramel. Strong alcohol dries the finish out. Still accented towards the toffeeish sweetness, though.

Island Pacific Coast Hefeweizen (PCH) (Island Weiss);Carpinteria, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Island Brewing;Notes from the file last updated in 2010. Pours yellow with white head. Aroma is wheaty. Flavor is citrus/wheat. Didn�t get much other flavor.
Island Pacific Coast Hefeweizen (PCH) (Island Weiss);Carpinteria, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Island Brewing;Bottle from the source. Pours with a murky golden body and minimal head. Aroma of grass, skunk, plastic, banana, vanilla, phenols and esters. Taste is burnt rubber, glue, pear, banana and asphalt. No idea what specifically is wrong with this one. Tastes very similar to beers I got at chain brewpubs in North Texas (not the Covey, there stuff was good). Lively bubbles try to hide the thin body. Lasting flavors of grass and skunk (light struck from a brown bottle I bought at the brewery?).
Island Pacific Coast Hefeweizen (PCH) (Island Weiss);Carpinteria, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Island Brewing;Bomber from BevMo Salinas. Nose of pasty grain and yeast , only a very light touch of fruity esters. Hazy yellow with a medium, lightly lacing, pale yellow head. Flavor is lightly sweet bananas with a light bitter note to go with the yeast.
Island Pacific Coast Hefeweizen (PCH) (Island Weiss);Carpinteria, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Island Brewing;Draught at the brewery. Hazy straw with no head. The aroma is interesting for the style, with a floral, perfumey, almost vanilla touch, and only light banana and spice. The flavor has some wheat, light clove, and funky yeast. Pretty bland overall though. Pretty watery with medium carbonation. The aroma was somewhat nice, but the beer fell apart from there. Not really a weiss that I would care for again.
Island Pacific Coast Hefeweizen (PCH) (Island Weiss);Carpinteria, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Island Brewing;On tap, part of sampler. Pours light gold. Aroma of intense wheat and fruit (orange and banana). Flavors featured are more of what is found in the nose, along with a touch of vanilla and spice. Alright. Sidenote: OK, I think I know what is going on with the rollercoaster ratings for this brewery. I talked to the brewmaster, he told me that a couple years ago they had a problem with distributors not keeping their bottled beers cold (Island uses a lot of organic ingredients), and as a result a sizable quantity of beers were drank sour. Please, give these guys another try, I think they may have righted the ship!

Island Pacific Coast Hefeweizen (PCH) (Island Weiss);Carpinteria, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Island Brewing;"(22 oz bottle: Purchased at the brewery) Given the problems I�ve had with Island beers going sour (previous bottles purchased at BevMo were completely infected), I purchased this bottle directly at the brewery, immediately placed it in my fridge, and am consuming it within 3 weeks. With that disclaimer given, this so-called ""Bavarian-style wheat beer"" is Bavarian only in the loosest sense. It tastes very much like the American versions of a hefeweizen, mild wheat flavor, lemony, with a barely perceptible banana component and no clove whatsoever. The banana is only detected when I first sip the beer, and then it fades almost instantly. And really, the lemony citrus is just way too strong to be pleasant, regardless of the style, especially in the finish where it totally dominates. It tastes like a wedge was not just dropped in my glass, but squeezed in. The body is light and the palate is fizzy, and those who like sour carbonated drinks will find this a refreshing beverage. The nose is mostly wheat and stinky feet. Bright yellow in color and fully cloudy, with a small white head that fades to a ring. Lacing is patchy, but minimal. Just because there is yeast in the bottom of the bottle and the beer is cloudy doesn�t make it an authentic German Hefeweizen, it needs to smell and taste like one too. If this bottle is also bad, then it doesn�t even have a refrigerated shelf life of three weeks, which is pretty ridiculous in my opinion. Perhaps the only way to tell is to sample the beer on tap at the brewery. The only reason I�m so patient with the Island beers is because it�s a family business and they are extraordinarily nice people."
Island Pacific Coast Hefeweizen (PCH) (Island Weiss);Carpinteria, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Island Brewing;Pale clouded yellowy orange appearance, decent head formation. Citrussy banana aroma. Plenty of banana on the palate, citrussy lemon, mild bubblegum, just finishes a little short. Pretty tastey German style hefe, rich and full flavored, very refreshing.

Ryklio Nasrai 9,5%;Ma�eikiai, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;UAB Brauer;"Probably one and only from ""Lokys"" which can be called real beer. Alcohol is not very noticeable if well cooled. Has a nice hint of stronger bitterness. Very rich colour."
Ryklio Nasrai 9,5%;Ma�eikiai, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;UAB Brauer;Bottled. Deep amber colour. Some toffee aroma. Sweet and soft with filling mouthfeel. Fruity. The alcohol is fairly well hidden, and this beer is of much higher quality than the lighter beers from this brewery.

Auksinis Princas;Ma�eikiai, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;UAB Brauer;Bottled. Amber colour, clear, no head. Fruity, some toffee, some raspberries. Rounded mouthfeel. Obviously designed to hide the huge amount of alcohol, and does that job fairly well, even if peppery, vinous flavours shine through. No obvious flaws, like in their lighter beers, but also not much going for it. And in the end the alcohol is getting to you...

Orange-golden in color and with a dense, creamy, off-white head. Some lacings. Looking good, but with too much chalk and yeast in the aroma. Oranges too, some pale malts and pine cones.

Pours with a mostly clear golden body with a somewhat longer (than per IBC�s usual) lasting white head. Aroma of candy corn, caramel, honey, bread and spicy hops. Taste is a bit bitter, tannic grain extraction, honey, and hops. Really dry, but not horribly flawed. Some metal notes. Lively bubbles, dry, bitter finish.
Island Blonde Ale;Carpinteria, California, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Island Brewing;Bomber. Nose of light flowery hops, caramel, and yeasty mustiness. Hazy urine yellow with a big pale yellow head. Flavor is a slight tartness, yeast, and a hint of caramel.
Island Blonde Ale;Carpinteria, California, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Island Brewing;Draught at the brewery. Light straw color with a fluffy white head. Faint malt aroma with a touch of floral hops. The flavor is light bread, crisp and light hops, and a mineral hardness. Very low on bitterness and sweetness. Light bodied with high carbonation. The mineral character works alright here, adding a crispness to the finish, but the flavors are pretty mellow overall. Decent for such a light beer
Island Blonde Ale;Carpinteria, California, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Island Brewing;Really faint aroma. Light color, no head. This is disappointing. Not much crisp flavor. Seems more like a pale lager than a kolsch. Certainly not great.

Minimal lacing along the sides of the glass. Below average-to-minimal retention on the top. Smelled Cascade hops, pine, citrus hops, floral notes, caramel, faint buttery notes, lemon, rye and honey wheat. Tasted pretty close to the smell. Just a little more bitter and dry. Got honey malts, caramel, citrus notes, floral hops, Cascade hops and rye. Light-to-medium body. Thin texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt, slightly bitter finish. Well this would have been a pretty good pale ale. I don�t see how it is an IPA, but I adjusted my ratings accordingly."

Island IPA;Carpinteria, California, United States;IPA;Island Brewing;Pours an orange/light amber color with a white head. Candied citrus peel, toasted bread, and some floral hop aromas. A very minimal pine note as well as some grass. The flavor is certainly sweet. Bread, toasted malt, and toffee are prominent. Candied orange peel, a little bit of peach, and some tropical fruit add to the sweetness. Minimal bitterness, a hint of grass, and that�s about it.
Island IPA;Carpinteria, California, United States;IPA;Island Brewing;Reviewed from notes. Poured into a tulip. Color is a moderate orange color with almost no head and certainly not too much lacing at all. The nose is some really, rally light caramel with basically no hop presence at all. The flavor is really quite light with a bit of bread. Feel has no bitterness and only the tiniest bit of sweetness. No real reason to drink this. Nearly a drainpour. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 11-12-2010
Island IPA;Carpinteria, California, United States;IPA;Island Brewing;"terrible beer. Im sure it would taste somewhat better on tap, however; it is just not balanced. I would just drive on past this brewery. I was hoping for more from this local beer, but luckily this is not the only option for me as there are several other great breweries nearby."
Island IPA;Carpinteria, California, United States;IPA;Island Brewing;Bottle from the source. Pours with practically no head...actually, there really isn�t any. Chill hazed amber golden body. Aroma of raisins, nuts, pine, chocolate, and everything you don�t think of when you think IPA. This beer is horrible. Green apple, dirty malt, super tannic from grain extraction (think sparging at 190*), soil, bitter, no hops. Really undrinkable! Probably the worst IPA that I have had. Drain Pour.
Oakham Inferno (Cask);Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oakham Ales;September 4, 2018 - at Tap East - handpull cask. Thank you split ratings! Had the bottle, now get to rate it on cask ... Clear and refractive slightly oily-looking gold with a nice white head and attractive lacing.

Airy, decent body, astringent and a fairly long finish - thankfully not at all sweet - wildflower bitterness in the linger. Very nice beer.

Lovejoys Cherry Bomb Dark Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;On draught at Lovejoy�s. There are no hops in this beer, just cherries. It is dark as night and has a thin head. The flavor is very nice...just a hint of cherries but enough to be a true fruit beer. It isn�t that bitter since there are no hops, but I like the taste. It is not sour so you won�t get that in it. Good beer.

Westons Vintage Cider;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;500ml Waitrose, English Vintage Cider Vintage 2015, bbMar2019. - A cider with the edges filed off, both at the top fruit sugars and the lemony zing. Good sessionable apple juice, a large batch sulphury edge adn natural enough - but it does not make most of its 7,3% in terms of character...falls flat on its watery ass with food.

Rush River The Unforgiven Amber Ale;River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rush River Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Hazy unfiltered orange-tan. Foamy, soapy off-white head. Pretty unimpressive beer. Some biting dry bitterness, not really that enjoyable...leads into a grainy thin malt bill, woody thin amber malt tones. The one-d bitterness is the only thing it has going for it, the malt tones aren�t that enjoyable. Not horrendous, not off, just not so good either.

Pours chocolate brown and a bit on the light side. Taste was bitter coffee, cheap chocolate, and a sour iron finish. Mouthfeel is almost tart and in general, far too light. Was not impressed.
Rush River Lost Arrow Porter;River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Rush River Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle. Pours black with off-white foam. Good malt body and flavor. Not nearly as bitter and intense as many micro-porters. But Porter is not supposed to taste like a Stout as so many do. I like this one and the only thing that I miss is the ester aroma found in Porters brewed in England.
Rush River Lost Arrow Porter;River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Rush River Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Red hued brown-black. Thin, creamy beige head. Medium bodied, mild Porter. Not a whole lot going on, leans into some fruity caramel and amber malt tones. No real hop depth, just some slight bitterness. No real malt depth either, none of the rich chocolate tones you might hope for either. Rindy, coffee grinds flavor. A disappointment, not unlike a soulless Mild.
Rush River Lost Arrow Porter;River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Rush River Brewing Company;This is my first Rush River review so I�m super excited. In all, Rush River only has about a dozen beer offerings so they are a pretty small and precise brewing operation located in River Falls, WI. Not really sure what to expect as you never really hear anyone says anything good or bad about their beer. It pours a dark brown color with a beige head that lingers around for a while. It has a mild robust scent of roasted malts, coffee, toffee, and caramel malts. Nothing exciting here, just your classic porter scent. The taste has elements of a heavy beer, but it still drinks rather light. There is a little bit of roasted malts and coffee in the taste but far from being bold. It finishes with a chalky, coffee after taste. This is a good beginner porter to see if you like the style, but it really could be more robust, flavorful, and thicker in texture. Porters certainly aren�t the most popular beer out there. Maybe it�s because it�s just really hard to make a good porter? This was a pretty good attempt by Rush River but as I said, it has room for improvement. It has great drink-ability, it�s just lacking that �wow� factor taste wise. -Chris Lemke of WisconsinBrewReview.com
Rush River Lost Arrow Porter;River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Rush River Brewing Company;Pours very dark with quickly fading head that almost disappears with spotty lacing.

Pours a very cloudy light orange, like pineapple juice. Aromas of citrus and grain. Medium body. Primary flavors of bitter grain, wheat and tart citrus. No sweet hefe notes.

Hopdaemon Green Daemon / Natural;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;Bottle, November 2016. Full gold, shrinking white cap. Aroma of decaying fruit, cherry blossom, stale lemon cake. Boozy almond hints blended with swimming pool water. Sticky, flattening mouthfeel. Lacks the requisite crispness and herbal hop for me.

Hopdaemon Green Daemon / Natural;Sittingbourne, Kent, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hopdaemon Brewery Co.;Fairly straight-forward and inoffensive blonde ale.

Poured at home into an 8 Sail Brewery badged pint sleeve on 25th May 17. Shared with no one. Very slight haze to the golden pour, uneven blanket of white foam for a covering. Soft feel to the brew body wise, first thing I noticed as I looked, sniffed and sipped. Aroma has a mild mixed fruity nature, the taste also has a mixed fruity trace in the flavour. The beer gets more sweeter and maltier as it warms a little, which I liked. Has more about it than your typical �Pale Lager� that�s for sure, would certainly be in my top 50 anyway.

Tindall Summer Loving;Bungay, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tindall Ales;Cask (GBBF 2006): Simple gold in colour. A little bland in both flavour and aroma. Lacking in complexity, a bit fruity. Refreshing, but not much else there.
Tindall Summer Loving;Bungay, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tindall Ales;Cask (handpump) at GBBF, August 2006. Day1, beer #15. One of a run of very similar light-bodied golden bitters (well this is GBBF) that seem to be aspiring towards a golden ale style but don�t really have enough aromatic character to pull it off. Light fruity notes and just a touch of hoppy bitterness. All very delicate. Easy-drinking in the extreme. Nothing particularly wrong with this, just not enough to distinguish it from the crowd.

Tindall Summer Loving;Bungay, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tindall Ales;Gravity at the Lobster summer beer festival, Sheringham. Big on pears and peardrops, really rather sharp
Tindall Summer Loving;Bungay, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tindall Ales;Bottled. Golden very slightly foggy, perhaps from the pour (the bottle has significant sediment). Fine sudsy head. Short hoppy aroma. Flavour is rather dank and home brew type thinness. Even at 3.6% it punches a little beneath its weight, which doesn�t say much. Oh well, there is plenty of other beer in the world.

Blue Point Organic Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);An interesting, lighter beer from BP. This one is smooth and semi-sweet with honey, and a sprinkling of hops. Yeasty aroma, yet clean and refreshing. There�s is nothing particularly striking about it, but I�d drink it again. (I think I will drink it again to improve this rating a bit).
Blue Point Organic Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);"Quite a good pale ale, though I don�t see much in this that makes it stand out next to their other hop-oriented beers (ESB, IPA) - the malts do seem to be emphasized over the hops, giving it a slightly different character - I�m holding out for their ""hoptical illusion,"" which I hope will be the hop-hearty ale I know that these guys are capable of making."
Blue Point Organic Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Had at the brewery. Light yellow/straw color with a slight head which lasted. Very nice mouthfeel- very smooth and left a pleasant residue on the back of my tongue. Moderately hoppy and has a nice base malt backbone to it. I guess this one costs more to make than their other ales becuase it cost $1 for a sample. Not bad though- just not spectacular. I think they were trying to emphasize the organic malt in this brew.
The Brew Kettle Honey Gold Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Brew Kettle;Very clear golden shade. Light white cover. A small note of plastic, like I frequently pick out in honey beers) disturbs the otherwise subtle, slightly grainy, timidly honeyed flavour spectrum. Very thin, yet its soft bubbles feel coherent. The honey can be perceived, but is subtle enough that I probably would not have picked it were it not in the beer�s name. Surprisingly not very sweet, not much anything in fact as simple as it is. After their schwarzbier, this was wholly superior, but still, I doubt I�d buy any bottle if I were to pass by the Brew Kettle again. Too bad because their draught offerings were great.
Greenshields Kolsch;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Greenshields Brewery & Pub;Well is was not a great brew. pours yellow with a light head. flavor had some malt to it but still not anything ill try again.

Tindall Norwich Dragon;Bungay, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tindall Ales;Bottle conditioned, 500ml. Gold amber beer with white head. This is a bright, crisp, hoppy bitter with a decent freshness for a BCA. Easy drinking and refreshing, probably one of the better British BCA�s that I have tried.

Tindall Norwich Dragon;Bungay, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tindall Ales;Bottled. Bright amber body with fine white head from the pour. Bitter, hoppy aroma. Strong bitter flavour that is straight and true, with good length and punch. A very solid bitter indeed.
F & M Premium Draft Light Ale;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Stonehammer Brewery;Poured a bleached straw color not much of a head. Very faint odors..some sweet malts...soft carbonation. Light watery mouth feel.....weak malt departure, slight hopping...fast clean finish again with the signature F & M bready after taste....very drinkable but very undistinguished except for the filnal bready yeast aftertaste. I don�t know where F & M was going with this one. It may turn up in pubs under a different name.
Westons Cider With Elderflower;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;Bottle, from Sainsbury�s. Straw coloured, no head and gentle condition. Low apple aromas and a crapiness that had touches of farmyard notes that in a better mood I would call sub-lambic, but not today. Vaguely sweet in the mouth with a gentle citric apple note and some floweriness but the elderflower seems to have been wasted in this one. Light sweet apple in the finish with some citric dryness at the end. Of the three flavoured Westons ciders this was by far the best, but still was a waste of cider, my money and my time.
Alchimiste Ensorceleuse;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Brown Ale;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Deep amber in colour. Aroma was malty(cookie dough) with some peppery spiciness. Flavour had some slight roasted malt, minor butterscotch and some light chocolate. Medium body, medium carbonation. Finishes with a spicy bitterness, slightly dry. Not bad.

Alchimiste Ensorceleuse;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Brown Ale;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Dark brown color with ruby glints. Its head is a nice one: thick, dense, lasting, beige. Fair malty aroma with hints of brown sugar and roasted coffee. Taste is well balanced, warming and pleasant. Various flavors of malt, coffee, chocolate and molasses. Decent dry and bitter final. Very drinkable, but not conform to the usual characteristics of brown ales.
Alchimiste Ensorceleuse;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Brown Ale;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Murky and deep brown color with a thick, well laced beige head. Nice aroma of molasses. Sweet brown sugar flavor balanced by a roasty counterpart, bitter finish. Light to medium body, sticky mouthfeel. A strange and unusual brown ale, but interesting nonetheless.
Alchimiste Ensorceleuse;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Brown Ale;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Sweet brown sugar and some funky buttery diacetyl. Dense tan head that recedes to cover. Butterscotch flavour is overtaken for a roasty, bitter finish. Medium-light body, somewhat watery and still. Cloyingly sweet but not undrinkable. Bottle.
Alchimiste Ensorceleuse;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Brown Ale;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Nice caramel and assertive hops...But a metallic invader easily topples this light number...

Liberty Myrtle Beach Unfiltered Wheat;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Liberty Brewery & Grill - Myrtle Beach;16oz Draft(Liberty Tap Room & Grill Myrtle Beach)-A hazy orangish yellow with an aroma of nothing. Taste of wheat and nothing else. No banana or cloves. A little weak. I believe this was New South because Liberty Brewery does not keg.
Liberty Myrtle Beach Unfiltered Wheat;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Liberty Brewery & Grill - Myrtle Beach;Growler, about 5 days old, from the brewpub (SC). Neat hazy dark yellow, medium thin white head - certainly looks unfiltered. Grainy aroma, hint of yeast. Taste - ok - foamy mouthfeel is pleasant but the taste is pretty bland - grainy and a bit pof yeasty - pretty weak. Mouthfeel makes it refreshing, but that is about all here.
Liberty Myrtle Beach Unfiltered Wheat;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Liberty Brewery & Grill - Myrtle Beach;This is truly one of my favorites. I live close to the place and nothing, I mean nothing beats this beer on a warm June night at the outdoor beer garden before a Myrtle Beach Pelicans game. This beer has a beautiful cloudy appearance and tremendous aroma of wheat, spices and fruitiness. The mouthfeel though is my favorite quality about this beer. It fills your mouth without filling your gut. Awesome!!!
Liberty Myrtle Beach Unfiltered Wheat;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Liberty Brewery & Grill - Myrtle Beach;"This was on tap, brewed as ""Deep River Wheat"" (same beer, different name) at Liberty. Cloudy, straw pour, with nice retention and soapy lace. Nice straw-grain and wheat notes in the nose... the bouquet gets better as it opens up. Unfortunately, the best part of the brew has passed. Wheat flavors are interrupted by overhopping, and a ""cut"" of pale biscuity malt. Citrus notes get lost easily, as well as any depth or complexity. The dry bitter back accompanies a crisp mouthfeel. The bitters are just too detracting for the style... May be ""based"" on a German hefe, but is definitely an American take on it. Just underwhelming."

Liberty Myrtle Beach White Ale;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Liberty Brewery & Grill - Myrtle Beach;Eh. I had it sans fruit, and it tasted bland and lighter than most white ales I have had. With the orange slice, it had more flavor and was refreshing. If I need fruit to make the beer, it's not worth drinking again. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Liberty Myrtle Beach Nut Brown Ale;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Liberty Brewery & Grill - Myrtle Beach;"A classic English nut brown, right down to the bitterness at the end. It smells better than it tastes; an average brown ale, and I can't say that I'd drink it consistently.

Larkins Best Bitter;Edenbridge, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Larkins Brewery;My Bottom Line: This suave Bitter offers oranges over caramel in a dry mouthfeel which leads to bitter hop leaves. Further Personal Perceptions: -A creamy head of foam covers the shiny amber. -This is a rather classic interpretation, but it is very enjoyable. -The finish is surprisingly dry given the initially silky body. -Yeast fruitiness is perfectly harmonious with the chosen hop bill. On cask at The Ypres Castle Inn, Rye.

Larkins Chiddingstone;Edenbridge, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Larkins Brewery;Canterbury Beer Festival, with SilkTork. Appealing copper/bronze colour. I wasn�t as keen on this one as ST. I don�t like that butterscotch diacetyl aroma and it seems to occur at festivals in beers that are not yet properly conditioned.

Harmon Wonderland Trail Ale;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;(draft) Clear amber body with off-white head. Aroma is medium sweet, orange peel, lemon. Taste is medium sweet, lemon, wheat. Light-medium body. Very mellow beer.
Goose Island Illinois Brewers Guild Replic Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Cream Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Hazy golden body with a thin, white head. The aroma is very light with a small emphasis on the hops. The malt seems almost non-existent. The body is probably the best part of this creamy and smooth while remaining light and airy. The flavors are fairly understated, with either the malt taking a bigger role or the hops dwindling down from the aroma. I think this is just a style I don�t understand. Other than the body, I don�t understand the point.
