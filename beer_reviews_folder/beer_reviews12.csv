Wiedemann's Bohemian Special (2002-2011);Cincinnati,Ohio,United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geo. Wiedemann Brewing Company;Horrible                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,absolutely horrible. This is essentially skunky Natty-Bo that�s adulterated somehow by a cheap malt that is otherwise indescribable. Worst beer I have had in a long time... And not because of otherwise curable ills (overheated,old                                                                                ,etc). Do not want. Another.
Wiedemann's Bohemian Special (2002-2011);Cincinnati,Ohio,United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geo. Wiedemann Brewing Company;Bottle. Picked this up at a gas station in southern Ohio. Couldn�t believe it. Didn�t know they still made this stuff! I remember that it taste like Miller when I was in colloge. Yea                                                                                    ,it still kind of does. Anyway. I think everyone should try this one at least once.
Wiedemann's Bohemian Special (2002-2011);Cincinnati,Ohio,United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geo. Wiedemann Brewing Company;Pick this up as a 6 pack for $2.50. Pours a golden-yellow with white head. Aroma is strong and malty. Taste is surprisingly smooth with a bit of body. Not a whole lot of flavor but not bad all things considered.
Wiedemann's Bohemian Special (2002-2011);Cincinnati,Ohio,United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geo. Wiedemann Brewing Company;Forty ounce bottle from Marathon station at 8th & Linn. This was good for a cheap beer back in the day when you could buy a 12 pack of bottles for less than $3.99. However                                                                                               ,it�s now brewed by Pittsburgh Brewing Company                                                                                                                                                                                     ,which seems to have done a better job with Falls City. Extremely light yellow color,aroma like in the old days but hops that fall somewhere between barely there and nonexistent. Same for the malt. Hell,even the same for the adjuncts. Seems to be competing with Miller High Life for Beer That�s Most Like Water award. Disappointing to say the least.

Wiedemann's Bohemian Special (2002-2011);Cincinnati,Ohio,United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geo. Wiedemann Brewing Company;Can. Sweet barley wheat aroma. Golden yellow with little head. Sweet corn malt flavor. Way too sweet for a pale lager. Don�t know why I even tried - just sentimentality I guess. Tastes better straight out of the can.
Wiedemann's Bohemian Special (2002-2011);Cincinnati,Ohio,United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geo. Wiedemann Brewing Company;"This may be my new favorite ""old man"" beer. This is what I remember ""beer"" tasting like before I was a beer drinker. Not overly carbonated like most Anheuser products, though it�s lacking in flavor and just about everything else, too. It�s kind of plain, and really light for something that isn�t labeled as such, but I dig it. I think next time I have a hankerin� for Pabst I�ll get this instead. Not an amazing brew to brag to your friends about, Wiedemann is still one to keep stocked in the fridge for hot days of yard and garden work and watching baseball. I�d kiss High Life goodbye if this was available at my choice of supermarkets."
Wiedemann's Bohemian Special (2002-2011);Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geo. Wiedemann Brewing Company;Pours a clear golden yellow, white head disappears almost instantly. Bubbles rampant, like club soda. Aroma of light pine, cereal and straw, some corn/vegetable. Flavor surprisingly bitter, mostly of corn syrupiness with an appalingly weak, watery texture. Finishes immediately, leaving behind an unpleasant, grassy aftertase. An alcohol delivery system, nothing more.
Wiedemann's Bohemian Special (2002-2011);Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Geo. Wiedemann Brewing Company;Not a bad beer. Poured a golden yellow with a slight head that disappeared quickly. Tasted like its price. Not bad. Almost reminded me of the Beast but without the nasty bite.

Colbitzer Heide-Bock Hell;Colbitz, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Colbitzer Heidebrauerei;I�m not a huge fan of this one. Its cloying sweetness is distracting from a smooth, golden body that, with more subtlety, might have been a good beer.
Colbitzer Heide-Bock Hell;Colbitz, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Colbitzer Heidebrauerei;Half-litre bottle: best before 30 Dec 2012, poured into an �Old Speckled Hen� badged pint vase @ home on 4 Nov 2012. Clear, bright and clean looking golden brew: on top a good, full snow white foaming crown. The nose is mildly caramel malty, with slight yeasty, cut grass and earthy notes. I expected a little more in the taste stakes: sweetish, malty and alcohol all evident but no real Bock type strength or depth. The finish is leaning towards a hoppy bitterness but the caramel sweetness almost blots it out. Not enough character for me. Went nicely with some Leerdammer, dry crackers and olives, but it just �didn�t float my boat� for a top Light Bock.

Pripps Jul�l;Falkenberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Carlsberg Sverige;"08-02-2019; can; at home (bought somewhere in Sweden). The looks of the beer are quite nice. The colour of the brew is a nice coppery red. The beer is crystal clear, and has a nice reddish amber glow. On top of the beer there is a nice layer of soft, light brown foam. Foam retention isn't bad. It looks very appetising. The aroma's of the beer are alright. It isn't to strong. Malts give some notes of toffee and caramel, and there is a roast edge. Furthermore, there are some nice herbal hops. Also a fruity hint is there. Sadly there is also a metallic note, that isn't necessarily that nice. It is a bit rough. All infall, it is alright. A bit too mild though. The taste of the beer is also alright. The malts give some nice sweets, whilst hops and some toast give bitterness. They are a tiny bit rough though. Not unbalanced, jus...unpolished I guess. The palate of the beer is fine. Medium body, slightly slick texture and rather high carbonation. The finish of the beer is fine. It has some caramel and toffee to it, together with some hoppy bitterness."

Sun Valley Cabin Fever Winter Ale;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Scottish Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;12oz bottle via trade with B�ck Dich! -Thanks Jordan! - Pours dark brown with a creamy offwhite head taht stays pretty well and laces the sides of the glass in layers. Aromas of nice caramel and toffee, with a touch of smoke. Flavor is nice full caramel malt, toffee, and a touch of smoke and earthy elements. Smooth and creamy in the mouth and full bodied. A touch of spice there on the finish but not overly so. I think this was right on for the style and I wonder why this is rated so low.
Sun Valley Cabin Fever Winter Ale;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Scottish Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;This was really hard to drink, but does capture the essence of what a scottish ale should taste like. This has a roasted caramel and smokey bit of peatiness that runs the gamut throughout the enitre session. Herbal hops come through and cut through the sweet malt character in the finish. Decent, but hard to drink.
Sun Valley Cabin Fever Winter Ale;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Scottish Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;Bottle: Deep amber, copper hues, moderate off-white head, foamy, fairly nice lacing. � Nutty nose, slight campfire and peat moss. � Charred wood and bandaid on the tongue. � Light semi-sweetened malts round out the backside. � Not sure if its an intended flavor or not, but that bandaid isn�t all that welcomed. � Kind of falls off at the finish. � Moderate body and mouthfeel. � A lighter Scottish Ale. � Thanks Jordan!

Some faint candy notes in the finish, but mostly just a smooth malty treat.
Sun Valley Cabin Fever Winter Ale;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Scottish Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;BottlePours a deep clear mahogany with a huge dense off white head. Light aroma of dark malts and slight spicy tonge as well. Flavor is woody and a bit metallic on the trailer. Light bodied and suprisingly low on the carobonation after seeing the show off of a head. The after taste is decidedly rusty and maybe oxidised. Old bottle maybe. Thanks to Buck Dichfor this one.
Sun Valley Cabin Fever Winter Ale;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Scottish Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;Ruby red/copper color with decent lacing. The flavor was nice and malty with even a hint of roastiness on the finish. Herbal hops in the middle all the way. B�ck Dich has this one pinned down pretty well.
Otra Beer;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Bottle: Pale yellow, light head and lacing. Nose of light lemon lime, some paint too! The flavor is thin, husky, citrusy. A typical lager as they come. Some sweet husk and stale hops propagate in the background.
Otra Beer;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);from Saarlander and found stuck away in the back of the beer frig. not much going on in this brew. pale yellow without much head or lace. mild corn flavor without much hop notes. very bland.
Otra Beer;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Sweet corny lager, without much taste or hops. Drinkable, but not good, still better than the Salvadoran lagers, must be the Wisconson water! lol! I remember the old EPIC wrestling promotion out here pitching the stuff.
Otra Beer;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Bottled. Label states that this is a quality lager beer, so that is a good sign. Pours a medium golden color. Aroma is very metallic and sour. Slightly skunky malty/grainy flavor. Not a very good beer.
Otra Beer;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"I thought for sure this beer was made in Mexico hence the name ""Otra"" meaning have another or so my limited spanish gringo ass speaks. Well its a shame that this is brewed by Coast Range since a few of their beers are real tasty treats. This beer has no flavor besides a strange lingering presence of rotten barley added with a heaping ratio amount of water in the wort. I paid $3.99 for a 6 pack and only did so because i was BBQing carne asada."
Otra Beer;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Oh man, this was gross. A friend bought a six pack for $1.99, so I knew it would be bad. Tasted metalic and bitter, maybe a little salty.
Otra Beer;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Light gold color, med head. A light bodied lager style beer. Mild malts and slightly hopped. Mild taste. Mild flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is neutral. There is nothing bad to say about this beer, but nothing good to say about it either, sort of a generic beer. Cheap, but so what.
Otra Beer;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"Color: slightly hazy straw-gold color with a curious green hue. Modest, white-foam head, active levels of carbonation. Nose: Malty nose with some hop flower. Flavor: Malty, but thin and surprisingly light. Finish: Smooth, not as crisp I usually experience with some lagers; a slight bit of oiliness. Hop bitterness is tempered by the wheat malt body."
Otra Beer;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Slightly grainy with cardboard and wet napkin smells. Burnt corn. This is awful. Woody and wet. Blunt, chemical bitterness with no trace of live hops. Sits in the stomach like a rock. My dog will avoid what I throw out, I know it. Ugh. Just plain disgusting. It's sitting in my stomach like a rock and I'm fearful.
Josef Hoffbauer Special Reserve Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;oh god the horror. Back in my abject poverty days, my friends dared me to pick up a 12 pack of this for 5.49. It was still money wasted. So far from beer as to create a new standard for piss-water. And the ice was even worse.
Josef Hoffbauer Special Reserve Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;"at the store my friend said ""5 dollars for a 12-pack?!? How can you go wrong???"" Well let me tell you, I dont know you can go any more wrong than josef hoffbauer, if you want a nice case of the shits pick this stuff up"
Josef Hoffbauer Special Reserve Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;As cheap as this is, it is still better than the typical offerings of the monster brewers. I�d take this over a Bud any day.
Josef Hoffbauer Special Reserve Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;4.49 for a 12 pack! A fricken 12 pack! Most of my beers I buy in singles cost more than 12 of these. Now lets see why...Pours a very clear golden color with a nice carbonated white head that dissipates very quickly. Aroma is scummy water, rice, maybe some hops....that�s a big maybe!! Thin taste, a sweet corn taste with absolutely nothing more. Except for the water. Watery palate. You know Josef light I gave a 0.5, because it was horrible, but this isn�t half as bad. Not good but not as bad as the light.
Josef Hoffbauer Special Reserve Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Never seen this beer before, but it is hard to pass up a 5.99 12 pack. Smells like corn, very light in color, big head from much carbonation. Taste is a little sweet, with not much else to it. Good if you have friends who want to drink cheap beer. Also, look how fancy it sounds . . . special reserve . . . Hoffbauer . . . onlookers will hever guess that it is the cheapest brew in town.
Josef Hoffbauer Special Reserve Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Really not bad for a cheap beer, not that I would drink this in mass quanitites. Has some fruit alcohol flavors, like so many of these cheap beers do. Soapy watery finish
Josef Hoffbauer Special Reserve Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Hurray, an opportunity to rate another fine offering from everyone�s favorite brewery, Gluek! 12 oz can, a case of which costs 4.79 at Kroger. Pours a very, very pale yellow with a slight green hue to it and a surprisingly well-formed white head. The aroma is rather weak and cereal. The smell of yard waste is in there, too, but it�s very faint, as is a weird saccharine sweetness. The flavor is, well, nothing. There�s some faint malty hay notes in there, but it�s mostly water. It gets slightly sweet after several sips, like Sweet-N-Low, and the finish becomes very artificial tasting. This is very tedious, and by no means good, but it doesn�t have any specific characteristics that directly offend me. I guess that makes it slightly better than most other macro swill.
Josef Hoffbauer Special Reserve Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;I don�t know, man. I really can drink this stuff. I don�t know why, but this stuff is mad drinkable for me. It�s crazy, but I really like this nasty horsepiss of a beer. It�s five bucks for twelve and it works.
Josef Hoffbauer Special Reserve Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;The only really distinctive aroma and flavor of this is can. Smells like can, tastes like can with a hint of beer. I gave it a couple 2s because there was a hint of fruity yeast that attempted to penetrate the cannyness and failed.
Josef Hoffbauer Special Reserve Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Light-tasting, a bit watered-down, doesn�t really smell or taste like anything. Pretty refreshing if you�re thirsty, but for half the price of Budweiser, shit... I had to try it.
Edison Light;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Century Brewing Company;Serving type: bottle Appearance- Pale golden yellow, heavy carbonation with large white head that quickly disappeared, almost no lacing Aroma- Light hop and Malt T/P - somewhat bitter and sour, over carbonated, left of sticky bad after taste in the mouth. Overall- Not very drinkable, I finished it but barely, like stated above left a bad after taste
Edison Light;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Century Brewing Company;clear 12oz bottle. Fancy American Light Lager. Aroma of grass and skunk. Corn sweetness. Watery.
Edison Light;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Century Brewing Company;You know what? Why not? A rich golden pour with a surprisingly well stood head on it�s shoulders. A solid pancake that recedes slowly to a lingering lace. Excellent carbonation and malty richness. No offensive flavors, even at higher temps. Throw in a well bittered finish and you have a better than average beer. Smells like a wet dog at first but turns to biscuits and gravy as it develops. Nice transition. All in all I would classify this as well above average. Lagers of this weight usually come from eastern Europe, Russia, etc. but they are not drinkable. This one really holds it together.
Edison Light;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Century Brewing Company;Appearance: clear light straw with a miniscule head and equally miniscule bubbly collar. Swirls with big bubbles but nothing more. Nose: unfortunately I can smell the beer from my seat and it�s not good. Creamed corn, old corn on the cob, stale bread and starchy grains. Palate: starts out bright, painfully so, then turns watery and bright. Not much to taste, realistically. Able to dredge up some dank and rank bread and hay in the back. Lemon in the middle and on top. Final Thoughts: skunked? Maybe. It does come in a clear bottle after all, but the liquid inside was crystal clear so a positive sign in that regards. Not really sure what the intentions for Edison were because even as a light lager tis really bad.
Edison Light;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Century Brewing Company;Mild hop aroma. Pours clear yellow with nice head. Flavor is reminiscent of other light beers, but not as harsh. Nicely carbonated and leaves the somewhat dry aftertaste that light beers have. Overall, this is a very good light beer that should be enjoyed by light beers drinkers. Not the my favorite style of beer, but a very good example for what it is.
Edison Light;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Century Brewing Company;Light golden color. Aroma is of English malts. Flavor is basically the same. Has a little bit of a bitter aftertaste. Nothing special.
Edison Light;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Century Brewing Company;From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with no lot code or date shown. The pour is pale yellow with a thin fizzy head and a bubbly carbonation. There is not much to whiff in the aroma. I note something corny and a faint hint of hops. The taste is a bit more malty than the aroma but otherwise it is basically plain and ordinary.
Edison Light;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Century Brewing Company;"BOTTLE from Trader Joes� assorted 6 pack. Proof final that any product with a ""cute"" play-on-words name has nothing else going for it. Awful. Even for a light beer. BUY AGAIN? No way"
Edison Light;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Century Brewing Company;Bottle from Vendome in North Hollywood.. Pours straw yellow with a thin white head.. Aroma was sweet and bready, slight biscuit aroma as well.. Flavor was citrusy and that was about it. Not the best pale lager out there.
Edison Light;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;New Century Brewing Company;12oz bottle courtesy of DuffManSW. Pale gold appearence, if that�s a color, but that�s what I get out of it. Kind of smells like that sweet hawaiian bread, very bready. Not a whole lot of flavor going on here, slight citrus zing, but not much else, very bland and boring. (971)
CJs Honey Brown Wheat;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;CJs Brewing Company;Not a bad brew, a little on the light side for me, but it goes down smooth. this beer is definatly worth tasting. I would drink it again
CJs Honey Brown Wheat;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;CJs Brewing Company;Sean's being generous. I was the one who chose this beer and I thought it mediocre at best.
CJs Honey Brown Wheat;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;CJs Brewing Company;This is pretty weird - it comes on with the off balance syrup of beers like Killian's, but the powerful honey close actually accents, rather than augments, the cloying beginning. It's just an odd brew.
CJs Vat 33 IPA;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;IPA;CJs Brewing Company;From notes. On draft at the brewery after a company kickball game on August 16. The pour is a darker golden orange with a thick white head and a good bit of lace. It�s really dark. The aroma is really interesting. There is a decent hop to it, but it remains pretty dank and overly sweet. There is a lot of malt and a strange graininess. The flavor is just the same. It�s funky and sweet with a hint of bitterness and it�s really kind of a mess. I�m just not feeling it at all. The mouth feel is thicker and heavy with a soft carbonation and a lingering battle of sweet and bitter between the grains and hops. Ugh. This couldn�t vanish fast enough.
CJs Vat 33 IPA;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;IPA;CJs Brewing Company;Standard ipa. Nice spice citrus. Even orange color. Nothing super, but drinkable and easy. Tap
CJs Vat 33 IPA;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;IPA;CJs Brewing Company;Tap at CJ�s. Aroma is a bit tame but decent. Caramel malt, grass, light citrus. Taste has very little bitterness. Grass, light pine, light citrus. Boring but still decent.
CJs Vat 33 IPA;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;IPA;CJs Brewing Company;On tap at the Plymouth location. Pours a clear amber with a near white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has light pine and grassy hops backed by earthy grains. Flavor is similar with mores grass notes and a musty grain backing. Finish is thin.
CJs Vat 33 IPA;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;IPA;CJs Brewing Company;At the brewery, golden pour, white head. Hop forward with some citrus and piney flavors. Again, it�s ok, like most of their beers.
CJs Vat 33 IPA;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;IPA;CJs Brewing Company;Draft. Poured clear copper color with an average frothy off-white head that lasted with good lacing. Moderate sour citrus aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Moderate bittersweet flavor with a moderate bittersweet finish of medium duration. Good drinkable brew.
CJs Vat 33 IPA;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;IPA;CJs Brewing Company;On tap: The aroma consists of moderate orange with some light grapefruit. It pours a transparent amber with a one finger off-white head. The flavor starts with oranges, light caramel, and a hint of grain. The finish has some light-moderate grapefruit hops with a hint of lemon peel. Light-medium bodied with soft carbonation and mouthfeel. Definitely the best they have to offer (in terms of their own beers) at the Plymouth location.
CJs Vat 33 IPA;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;IPA;CJs Brewing Company;Why the low ratings? Nice hop bite. Spruce nose. Solid brew.......................
CJs Vat 33 IPA;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;IPA;CJs Brewing Company;3 zo taster cup at Michigan beer fest in Ypsilanti. Yellow-amber pour with a small white head. No real aroma to speak of, some light pine. Tastes like a pale with mild hops and some biscuit. Palate was just a bit thin. overall: Kinda weak, more like an English biter that a US IPA.
CJs Vat 33 IPA;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;IPA;CJs Brewing Company;On draft at the brewpub. I had this a long time ago and never rated it but I�m sure it is much better now. A nice light copper color (I swear the guy drinking the same next to me had a deeper orange color). Not much of any aroma. A grassy type bitterness. Could use a bit something else such as a fresh piney aspect. But it is very drinkable and went very well with food. .
CJs Rich-Hagg Red Ale;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;CJs Brewing Company;From notes. On draft at the brewery after a company kickball game on August 16. The pour is a decently dark red pour with a thin cream colored head that slowly falls to a dense cap. The aroma is really bland. There is a light maltiness to it, and a hint of sweetness, but that�s it. It just falls flat after that. The flavor is much more of the same. It�s got a light toffee and a hint of hop, but it�s just so light and hardly there. Fuck. The mouth feel is thin and slick with a surprising lack of conversation and a lingeringly sweet finish. For something that doesn�t have anything going on, it was impressive on that front alone. It was sweet malt water. Sigh.
CJs Rich-Hagg Red Ale;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;CJs Brewing Company;Too hoppy for a red. Color is good. Not enough malts. Not a fan. No caramel, no nutty. Tap
CJs Rich-Hagg Red Ale;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;CJs Brewing Company;At the brewery, red pour, white head. Roasty and malty, and a little amount of bitterness. It�s ok
CJs Rich-Hagg Red Ale;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;CJs Brewing Company;I ordered the sampler here and I don�t feel like rating each individual beer, so it�s all going here. Every one of the six beers in the sampler were less than good. The IPA was probably the best of the bunch (not saying much), while the white was hard to put down (and that�s just the sample size). I�d rather have a Leinie Red than this red.
CJs Rich-Hagg Red Ale;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;CJs Brewing Company;Not much for aroma, bearly any head at all. The flavor was not bad but nothing to write home about, but all of CJ�s beers seem medicore.
CJs Rich-Hagg Red Ale;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;CJs Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle: Transparent deep amber with a diminishing off white head. Aromas of sweat socks up front, with some sweeter caramel malt in the back. Tastes like crap, my god, stale ingredients, slightly bitter finish.
CJs Rich-Hagg Red Ale;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;CJs Brewing Company;This just very well be the worst brewpub (beer wise) that Ive ever come across. The flavors of the bottled product are just sour, funky and stale. Either they dont know how to bottle or the beers just suck ass.
CJs Rich-Hagg Red Ale;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;CJs Brewing Company;This has decent malt flavours - fruitiness (plum) and nuttiness both, and a bit of hops, too, but the thing is textured really wildly.
CJs Lower Straits Stout;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Stout;CJs Brewing Company;On tap: The aroma consists of light-moderate chocolate, light roast, and coffee. It�s a dark brown with some orange highlights and a small khaki head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a slightly thicker ring. There is some sporadic webbing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with light chocolate that builds slightly in the finish and mixes with moderate roast, lighter coffee, burnt notes, and a hint of nuts. It�s light-medium bodied with light-moderate carbonation.
CJs Lower Straits Stout;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Stout;CJs Brewing Company;Notes from summer. Draft. Pours black. Aroma and taste are weak roasted malts.
CJs Lower Straits Stout;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Stout;CJs Brewing Company;Even tasting with roasted nuts and malts. Aroma was great and full. Mouth feel was thick. Tap
CJs Lower Straits Stout;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Stout;CJs Brewing Company;From notes. Finally getting around to adding beers from the Ypsi Summer Beerfest! Enjoyed on July 25. The pour is a decently dark brown, but there are a lot of reddish edges. There is a pale off white head and just bout no lace. The aroma is really thin. There is some light roasted malet and some cocoa. That�s about it. Really thin. The flavor mimicked it. There was perhaps a little hop and dark fruit present in the flavor, but it was just very disappointing. The mouth feel was like it was brown water. There just wasn�t any body there, and the carbonation hardly helped. The aftertaste was lingering, and like a sweet malt that faded rather quickly
CJs Lower Straits Stout;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Stout;CJs Brewing Company;This brewery is amazing don�t get me wrong! First time having there stout wasn�t very impressive, The taste was very daul with a water down finish the Coffe/Roasty Aroma! The reason why I think I even finished it was because you could taste the Hops! Very depressing!
CJs Lower Straits Stout;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Stout;CJs Brewing Company;At the brewery, black pour and tan head, dissipating quickly. Roast and chocolate in the nose. Same in the taste, good.
CJs Lower Straits Stout;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Stout;CJs Brewing Company;Thin body. Roasty. Underwhelming but not bad at all...............................
CJs Lower Straits Stout;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Stout;CJs Brewing Company;On tap in commerce. Thin with a small head and almost no smell. But it tastes like a stout. A strong roasted coffee flavor but still very drinkable. The nice hop finish is probably the reason I enjoyed this beer.
CJs Lower Straits Stout;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Stout;CJs Brewing Company;MiBG Summer fest 2009, Saturday session: Nearly black with a small fading head. The aroma has notes of coffee, chocolate, leather, grassy hops and some plum esters. The taste is fruity and chocolate with light bitterness. The finish displays lots of coffee and some ashy notes. The mouth feel is soft and a touch thin. Simply run of the mill, needs more depth and mouth feel.
CJs Lower Straits Stout;Commerce Township, Michigan, United States;Stout;CJs Brewing Company;On tap at the 2009 MSBF. Opaque black with small tan head. Coffee and roast aroma dry, a little smoke. Flavor is similar but more chocolate and a little lactose, definent roast and coffee though. Medium and well carbonated body. Good enough.
Coeur d'Alene Huckleberry Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;On tap. Hazy golden with a tiny white top. Big berries in the nose. Sweet berries in the taste with a bit of grass.
Coeur d'Alene Huckleberry Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;This was the first huckleberry beer I�ve had, and I�m not sure its an experience I need to repeat. Not a bad beer, but this kind of berry sweetness seems a bit uneccessary. Tart and a little hoppy. Weak to medium body. Picked up for me by Kent and Rebecca.
Coeur d'Alene Huckleberry Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Loved it! very smooth taste not too fruity. The steam plant is an excellent place to go to if you�re ever in spokane.
Coeur d'Alene Huckleberry Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub in Coeur d�Alene in August 2009. Couldn�t put this review in with the rest of my backlog earlier, as this place was listed as closed for a period of time. One of the better beers we had a Coeur d�Alene. Maybe this was just that good in comparison to everything else. Pours a light yellow color with a decent head and a touch of lacing. The nose brings some fairly-nice berry notes, which continue into the taste. The taste, however, is a bit artificial. Feel is pretty light and cooling. Drinkability is decent. This might have been their best beer and that�s simply because it tasted artificial rather than having all sorts of off flavors. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 11-30-2010
Coeur d'Alene Huckleberry Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Bottled (thanks omhper!). Amber colour, small white fluffy head. Aroma is blueberrylike (huckleberry is said to be blueberries in a bushgrown alternative), some juniper (!), mild spruce as well as earth. Flavour is dark berries, some sweet malts and a bit salty notes in the background. The more I have of it, the worse it gets. Still far away from the worst beers the bastard from Stockholm has brought back to me .)
Coeur d'Alene Huckleberry Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a golden color with a small off-white head. Has a sweet fruity huckleberry aroma. Fruity malty sweetish huckleberry flavor with some weak hoppy hints. Has a fruity malty sweetish huckleberry finish.
Coeur d'Alene Huckleberry Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;355 ml bottle. From Spokane, WA, USA. Clear dark golden colour with small bubbly white head. Crisp berries (huckleberry?), yeast, sugar and malt in aroma. Sweet sugar, malt, yeast, berries and some mild hops in flavour. This berry beer really taste like berries.
Coeur d'Alene Huckleberry Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;The Dan Journal #387. Tasted 8/5/10. 12oz bottle. Filtered with a golden hue. White ring of head. Aromas of vanilla, berries and a mild peppery note. Medium bodied with a perfumy and floral body. Flavors are spicy and tart with a great berry quality. Tangy effervescence. Crisp body and good flavors. Decent stuff.
Coeur d'Alene Huckleberry Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub (Spokane, WA location). The first in a long serie of huckleberry beers I sampled in these parts. Cloudy golden, small head. Aroma of of spuce and huckleberry (less sweet blueberry). Perfumy and aromatic, light bodied and fresh with light grainy malt and slight grassy bitterness. Not complex, but appealing and quenching like few American fruit beers.
Coeur d'Alene Huckleberry Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Bottle. Pale-ish yellow, average looking in the glass. Aroma is blueberries, I suppose technically huckleberries, but I�ve never smelled those. First thought was blueberry pancakes, there being some breadiness going on there as well. Thin in the mouth, really disjointed, no coherent focus on the palate. Some artificial-tasting berry notes, metallic, blueberry on the finish that unfortunately lasts. This may be harsh but it�s a bit like a Budweiser or something with blueberry flavor added, the blueberry isn�t integrated and the overall concept is confused. Not good.
Coeur d'Alene Centennial Pale Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;"""first impression of aroma and taste was ""macro"" pale ale.

Coeur d'Alene Centennial Pale Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;355ml bottle poured a pale golden color with small white head and a few spots of lacing.

Coeur d'Alene Centennial Pale Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub in Coeur d�Alene in August 2009. Couldn�t put this review in with the rest of my backlog earlier, as this place was listed as closed for a period of time. Pours a light yellow-golden color with a short single-finger white head without any retention and really no lacing either. The nose is pretty bad with just a tiny amount of pale malt and not really any hop presence. The taste follows suit and is just uber-bland. Feel is really light and astringent. No reason to take more than an ounce or two of this. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 11-30-2010
Coeur d'Alene Centennial Pale Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Bottle. Toffee malt and grass aroma.

Coeur d'Alene Centennial Pale Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Bottle from Brewforia. I guess this brewery is gone out of business? Anyway, unknown vintage. Pours a cloudy orange color with a medium white head. A earthy malt and orange nose. The flavor is basically a light fruity hop, dry pale malts. Simple and thin in terms of flavor.
Coeur d'Alene Centennial Pale Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub (Spokane, WA location). Clear deep golden, no head. Mild grapefruit aroma. Mid sweet with clean mouthfeel. Some caramel and slight grapefruit. Mediu bitterness. Fairly shy and a bit sketchy.
Coeur d'Alene Centennial Pale Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours an attractive shade of deep straw gold, cloudy. Pleasant aroma of grassy hops with some wet straw, some pine, maybe a little too pine-soly. Creamy in the mouth, palate coating, bitter, salty throughout the mid- & back-end, salty finish lasts and is rather unpleasant, strange.
Coeur d'Alene Centennial Pale Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;2010 Bottle - Pours a hazy lt copper with a small white head...aroma is old grain, feet, metal and slight toffee...flavour is thin, gritty grain, lightly bitter and stale hops, saltine crackers...wow this is fuckin terrible...
Coeur d'Alene Centennial Pale Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;5 oz sample at brewpub. Clear golden pour with a foamy white head. Aroma of mild vegetal hops and cheese, along with buttery popcorn. Taste is nutty, not much citrus or pine at all. Very bad. Medium light body, soft carbonation. Maybe this was a bad batch since this beer apparently won gold medal so I�ve heard. But there seem to be overall low ratings for this so maybe they should change the recipe or something.
Coeur d'Alene Centennial Pale Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Bottle: &nbsp Fiery golden, clear, lively carbonation, moderate sized frothy white head, spotty lacing. &nbsp Odd barnish nose, a little like really old cat urine on a potatoe sack. &nbsp Mild hop bite on the tongue, a little spritzy. &nbsp Better than the nose suggested. &nbsp Does have a stale malt background, similar to a potatoe sack. &nbsp Backside is a little astringent. &nbsp Not heavy, but enough to make this Pale seem a little medicial. &nbsp Finishes somewhat flat, a little stale, with minor astringency. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate. &nbsp Lingering staleness. &nbsp Not bad, but certainly not great either.
Coeur d'Alene Golden Ale;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery in August 2009. A: Light gold slash straw colored with very minimal head. S: A little bit going on here. Mostly a grainy/corn-type scent, but nothing seems too out of place. Some residual sweetness as well. Mild hop presence. T: Much like the smell, this one is mildly sweet and would be a good introduction to non-lagers, but there�s really nothing at all special about it, other than the lack of diacetyl, which most of this place�s beers had. M: Moderately creamy and medium bodied. D: Fairly drinkable. Not much taste, but fairly light and refreshing. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 09-01-2009

Coeur d'Alene Amber;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;The first thing that really struck me here was the great roastiness in the malt, which struck a good balance with the hops, allthough there is room for improvement. The aroma is nice and full as is the flavor, but the Coeur d'Alane signature is here in full swing: strong grains which somehow fall off the palate through a flush of bitterness.

I get it both at the Steam Plant in Spokane and at the original site on Lakeside in Coeur d�Alene (formerly T.W.Fishers). It�s only mildly heady from the tap but is well carbonated.

I love a good stout but my favorite thing to do is to mix the polar bear and the huckleberry beer half and half. My dad taught me this after drinking a similar concoction at McMenamins in Portland. There the drink is made from the ""Terminator"" stout and the ""Ruby"" which is a raspberry wheat. Together they combine forces and become the ""Rubinator"". We mixed the stout taste of the polar bear and the sweetness of the huckleberry and called it the ""Hucklebear"".

Coeur d'Alene Polar Bear Stout;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;The deeply roasted aroma is very similar to the Pullman Porter, but the flavor just tastes overdone, so roasted its almost burnt (like Starbucks coffee) and the alchohol is a bit intrusive here. Other than this astringent aspect the beer is relatively well rounded. Not a bad stout.
Coeur d'Alene Polar Bear Stout;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Coffee aroma, very nice. Taste is creamy and roasty with a big dose of coffee. The beer could be good at this point, but then a harsh grainy bitterness comes into play and ruins the experience.

Mill Creek Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mill Creek Brewery;Fruity, hoppy aroma (Cascade?). On the dark side for a Pale, being a somewhat dark copper color. Nice, even carbonation, with a slight but dense head. Quite a hoppy flavor profile, with what seems like a variety of different hop varieties coming through. Very IPA-like. Some wood flavors as well, curiously. Very dry, long finish, full of hop bite. The malt flavors seem like they would be caramel and sweet, but this beer is all about the hops. Not great balance, but okay mouthfeel.
Mill Creek Honey Hemp Blonde;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mill Creek Brewery;Light, vaguely sweet aroma. Light golden color, almost pilsner-like. Some grainy wheat flavors, mixed with light honeyish sweetness. No hops in the flavor profile at any stage. Not much carbonation, which this beer could do with, since there's not much flavor. Very so-so, and that's perhaps being generous.

Borsodi Barna;B�cs, Hungary;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Borsodi S�rgy�r (Molson Coors);This beer is not produced anymore, but I�ve consumed a few bottles of it, back then. It was kinda average mass-produced dunkel style beer for the masses. It had a slight sweet, malty taste with some coffee, roasted malt, was light bodeid, slightly hoppy. It has not been the best hungarian Dunkel.
Borsodi Barna;B�cs, Hungary;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Borsodi S�rgy�r (Molson Coors);Bottle. Old notes from a visit in Budapest. Dark brown with a medium tan head. Quite weak aroma with some roasted malt and fruits. Sweet taste of roasted malt, chocolate and some alcohol. Unfortunately, a boring beer that was not so good.

Dreher Classic;Budapest, Hungary;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dreher S�rgy�rak (Asahi);Draught. Pours pale golden, crystal clear, with a thick white head that is mostly lasting. The nose is closer to that of a macrolager, grainy crisp, but including more interesting aromas: plum and grapes. Refreshing and balanced in mouth, not too complicated but way better than most macrolagers, with no flaws. Creamy palate and short finish. A well-behaved pils.
Dreher Classic;Budapest, Hungary;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dreher S�rgy�rak (Asahi);If I could rate presentation then it would have a 5/5 with it having come in a massive 3L 'pour it yourself tap'. The beer has a very light taste and can easily be drunk fast due to the taste being rather moreish! Would definitely recommend a try.
Dreher Classic;Budapest, Hungary;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dreher S�rgy�rak (Asahi);"This recipe contained maize grits, therefore it had a characteristic mixture. In the first sips hops showed up, but it's not that significant. Characteristic, but tasted bad, at least its not watery and insignificant unlike ""Dreher Gold"". But it got watery when you reached the bottom, it even got worse."

Dreher Lager;Budapest, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dreher S�rgy�rak (Asahi);330 ml bottle from a supermarket in Italy. Not sure if it was the �Dreher Lager� or �Dreher (Italy)� according to Ratebeer. I�m going to post a double review to be sure that everybody can know how much terrible is this beer. This is probably the unique beer that I wasn�t able to finish. Undrinkable. No aroma. Awful taste. This isn�t the classical supermarket�s lager, this is simply terrible.

P�csi Szalon Barna;P�cs, Hungary;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;P�csi S�rf�zde;Good looking dark brown color with a slight foam. Chocolate, roasted malt aroma. Taste is a mixture of roasted caramel malt and alcohol. Not that good. Especially it's aftertaste, it's too alcoholic.

Triumph Jolie Blonde;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;Draft. Pours a copper body with a white head. Very spicy, with pepper tones, bell peppers, spicy rye, ginger root, and more spicy notes. Hot in the sense of spices. Light body and quite quaff able. Good stuff.
Triumph Jolie Blonde;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;I�m always skeptical about spicy beer, but this one was a pleasant surprise. Golden-copper color with light head. Sweet aroma that is fairly malty. Taste is quite spicy with lots of pepper and some other sweet malts. Good taste wise, but anything spicy in my glass is always a bit odd. I give Triumph props for trying these brews and in this case, I would say succeeding.
Triumph Jolie Blonde;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;A very different kind of beer, very unique, light copper color, generous soft off-white head, nice lacing around the glass, sweet nose of ginger, coarse black pepper & light malt, medium in body, seems like a regular-ol� lager type of beer until the finish, the front was mostly smooth & light malt, but then the finish kicked you in the mouth, that�s where the peppers arrive, tasted of liquid cayenne, gave that abrasive bite associated with spicy food, left a little sting on the lips as well, this is the first beer that I�ve tasted that could actually be brewed with peppers & be drinkable (you know which one I�m talking about!), I�m not sure if the name means anything, but I didn�t expect this kind of beer with that kind of name (maybe I�m just dumb), but a very good & enjoyable beer
Triumph Jolie Blonde;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Flavored - Other;Triumph Brewing Company;on tap in Princeton, took a growler home. Clear light amber with medium carbonation. Aroma is of ginger, mild black pepper, light grains and malt. Taste is ginger up front, with some sweet malt, and some dry biscuit malt, which changes near the middle and end of the beer, which is where the chilis come through. A medium amount of heat in the finish that lingers nicely. I personally would have liked more chili peppers in the taste up front, maybe some of that character has diminished since it has been on tap for awhile before I had this.
Triumph Oatmeal Stout;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Triumph Brewing Company;Tap at the brewery.

Hartwall Dark Lager IV A;Lahti, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Hartwall (Royal Unibrew);Bottled (true vintage, BBE 2003, enjoyed in 03/2013). Very deep ambery brown colour with a mediumsized slightly off-white head. Aroma is caramel, some slight burnt sugary notes as well as some mild toasted notes. Slight ripe fruit as well, which may be a result of oxidation. Flavour is mild roasted malts, some caramel and burnt sugar along with mild some slight raisiny notes. Doesn�t taste cardboardy or sweetly oxidized, so this beer has actually held the 10 years or so rather well. I�ve had way worse fresh beers.

John Harvards Raspberry Wheat;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at brew house. Poured a very hazy light gold with a thin head. Aroma was mild tart berries. Taste has a mild tart fruit flavor, along with wheat and light mellowing malts. It finishes crisp and clean with little bitterness. A very light and flavorful fruity beer that is not overly sweet.
John Harvards Raspberry Wheat;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Beautiful raspberry aroma, lovely olfactory. Pinkish cloudy brown, no head. Good palate tingle. Tart yet not sweet. Fruity flavors overwhelm but even tho it is tart is is not on the sour side! Leaves a dull ale mild bitter finish. Simple fruit mixed with wheat ale. Overall, not bad and for a fruit beer it�s above my average.

John Harvards Raspberry Wheat;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at the Harvard Square location. Pours a reddish amber brown color, mildly hazy and medium white head. Has a faint raspberry aroma, some wheat. Flavor is similar, wheat comes through more in the finish, mild raspberry tartness. I'd liken this to raspberry iced tea. Not very interesting, not all that much flavor either, just easy to drink.
John Harvards Raspberry Wheat;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);I like this beer. It isn't super rich or hoppy, but the raspberry tastes natural, and it is very smooth. Very heady. A nice fruit style for hot weather.
John Harvards Raspberry Wheat;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Springfield, PA location... Hazy red/pink color with a white head and nice lace. Sweet berry aroma. Wheaty and rasberry taste (name fits this one well!) with a rather full mouthfeel. This was a nice beer. But indeed, extract seems to take precedence over real fresh raspberries.
John Harvards Raspberry Wheat;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);(monroeville,PA brewpub)A nice light fruit beer, light hazy yellow color similar to a hefeweiss. raspberries are immediate obvious from the sweet fruity aroma. however on drinking the tart rasberry taste is not there causing this to taste like a rather sweet wheat beer with some rasberry extract.
BIP Svetlo Pivo;Belgrade, Serbia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;BIP-Beogradska Industrija Piva;500ml can courtesy of Shuggie, drunk in Kotel on a warm October evening. Pours clear with a thin, fast-settling fluffy head, plenty of lacing, no visible rising carbonation. Yellow gold in colour. Aromas are a light but harmonious blend of hay, floral hops and bready malts. In the mouth, thin to medium texture, slight sweetness, flavours of floral honey, bread and soft malt biscuits, a short crisp finish. Overall, no flaws but a forgettable lager/pilsener.

Pils Light (Apatinska);Apatin, Serbia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Apatinska Pivara (Molson Coors);Canned. Better than Jelen pivo, I think. Grassy aroma, good hoppy flavor. Good beer for bus journey in Serbia.
Pils Light (Apatinska);Apatin, Serbia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Apatinska Pivara (Molson Coors);I was very surprised when I, after a couple of years of absence, found a bottle of this at a local supermarket. Very average and boring beer, grain and herbal hops aromas dominate the taste. Very thin and mild, therefore quite easy drinkable. I guess it�s OK to drink this in summer...
Pils Light (Apatinska);Apatin, Serbia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Apatinska Pivara (Molson Coors);can, received from a friend from Serbia. Clear pale yellow, large and fluffy head. Malty and fruity (apple), slightly dusty and hoppy. Hints of herbs.
Pils Light (Apatinska);Apatin, Serbia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Apatinska Pivara (Molson Coors);0.5l ugly can courtesy of ozujsko (thanks!) It poured a clear yellow colour, with tons of bubbles clinging to the edge of the glass with a medium to big sized fluffy white head that went away at a medium pace. Slightly fizzy. The nosed turned out to be malty/fruity, with hints of sourish lemon. Quite nice. The taste is light, and slightly watery but pleasant. A nice maltiness with obvious underlying hopiness (not floral here...) that forms the aftertaste as well. Not bad
Pils Light (Apatinska);Apatin, Serbia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Apatinska Pivara (Molson Coors);A friend returned from Serbia, with a bottle of this beer and a bottle of Brauerei MB pils, for me to sample, exclaiming that these were the local favourites. Poured into a Pilsner glass, it quickly formed a snow white fluffy head, that lasted to the end. Crystal clear straw-yellow in colour and medium carbonated. Aroma was grassy, feintly floral with a bit of spice and grain husks. The palate was light, clean and crisp. Sweet malt in the front and floral rounded hop tones throughout. Diacetyl slickness is noticable but balances out with the spicy dry swallow. A decent Pilsner style beer, suited to the climate I imagine of Serbia and equally suited to Australia�s.

John Harvards Oatmeal Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap @ Lake Grove: Poured a clear amber color with a small off-white head.

John Harvards Oatmeal Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Tap at the Lake Grove location. Dark amber beer, with a thin off-white head. Aroma is lightly toasty with hints of caramel malt. Flavour is mostly malty. Some herbal hoppiness and the oatmeal does make an appearance, mostly as counteracting the otherwise overly fizzy carbonation. OK, but one of the weaker brews they have to offer.
John Harvards Oatmeal Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at the Manchester, CT location. Very faint, caramelly aroma with some metallic aromas as well. Lacklustre aroma without much distinction. Murkey, hazy amber color with an off-yellowish head that is really small. Pretty sweet, sugary, malty start which is followed by some metallic oat flavors. More sugary sweetness follows with some unexpected booziness as well. Hops are not detected. Interesting attempt, but this doesn�t really work for me.
John Harvards Oatmeal Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Springfield, PA - Oatmeal Amber poured flat, iced tea appearance, some malt aroma. Very little oatmeal flavor. It�s the type of beer a homebrewer may attempt. Nothing earth shattering, but I had to give it a try.
John Harvards Oatmeal Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Manchester, CT. Arrive looking deep amber, with absolutely no head. Not even lacing. Oily glass? The aroma is nearly undetectable in the bar. I think I need a nasal upgrade. Mild malt with a little bit of sugary sweetness. Flavor is smooth and mild. Very little bitterness, although containing a rich sweetness for such a light bodied beer. Pretty tasty, and the oats impart an interesting sweetness that's not at all unpleasant. Carbonation was a little too intense for me, but I just finished a hand pulled beer, so what do I know.
John Harvards Oatmeal Amber Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);(monroeville,PA brewpub) this was a cask-conditioned seasonal brew. very flat even for a cask ale. malty but in a cloyingly sweet manner. I think that the additional oatmeal resulted in the starch sugars overpowering the hops in the original amber ale. An intersting expeiment , maybe the next batch will be more balanced.
New Zealand Lager;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Tallboy that I picked up in a strip mall wine shop in Auckland. Decent can. Very pale brew with a lacing white head. Fresh aroma, smells like beer, but with a little eggy underpinning. Very low bittering, fairly sweet, some nuttiness and sunflower seeds. Goes a little flat. Not great, not swill.

Schans Blond;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Schans;Copper bodied with a small but firm, off white head. Very fruity, moderate aroma, with madarin, peach and a backup from a solid malty base. Cookie dough and a sweaty feel to it, which extends into the taste. Medium carbonation fails a bit to bring out the potential, for me. Not as sweet but also not as rich as the flavour indicated. For some reason I like the super simple, almost amateurish label. Not the brewer�s best or most exiting, but very accessible and still well brewed. (33cl bottle, bought at the brewer�s shop)
Schans Blond;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Schans;Some banana in the aroma, some malt, not too pleasant. Darker yellow. Nice palate with some soft banana icecream flavors, some spice. Kind of thick beer, but nice and warming. Bottle from De Schans shop in Uithoorn.

Schans Blond;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Schans;(Bottled, no BBE) Somewhat hazy golden with a medium, lacy head. Aroma of pale malt and herby-grassy hops, mildly acidic with a touch of honey. Flavor is very herby and grassy-hoppy, with honeyish but dryish pale maltiness, and some licoricey notes. Medium body, balanced medium carbonation. A quite interesting and pleasant blond with pilsenery-aromatic hops, but also a unique, herby character. Nice. 4535

Clear, very dark red with a huge, fluffy, slowly diminishing, tan head. Sweetish-malty aroma of coffee, caramel and hints of dark, ripe fruits. Roasty-malty taste of mainly coffee, some caramel and hints of dark, ripe fruits, followed by a medium long, slightly bitter, roasty and coffeish finish. Medium body, effervescent mouthfeel, average to lively carbonation. Quite okay, just way too much carbonated, making it not that easy to drink.

Hook Norton 303AD (Bottle);Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hook Norton Brewery;Bottle (in NZ). A slight haze, but a very nice golden amber pour. A white head that didn�t hang around. The aroma didn�t pack much, but the palate is full juicy malt, with a good hop bitterness and a touch of citrus coming over the top of that. This is my type of beer.

Hook Norton 303AD (Bottle);Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hook Norton Brewery;A nice amber color and a moderate head. The aroma is has notes of aroma hops and malt, the flavour is full. I sense roasted malt, caramel, fruit and quite a bit of citrus towards the end, with a tendency to get a bit to grapefruit like. It�s a nice and fresh beer with good points.
Hook Norton 303AD (Bottle);Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hook Norton Brewery;A nice looking golden brown color with a finger width of filmy white head that stuck with the glass until the last swallow. The aroma was distinctly hoppy, but not much less to say: very ho-hum. In the mouth I did notice the bubbly texture, but I was overwhelmed by the bitterness that dwarfed any other flavor. The finish washed down smoothly, but the bitterness of the aftertaste lingered on the palette too long for my preference. Someone who was more into this style of beer would probably be ga-ga over this Hook Norton offering, but for me this was just overly one-dimensional.
Hook Norton 303AD (Bottle);Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hook Norton Brewery;Nice hoppy exuberence but a bit one sided as far as flavorings. It does almost have a malty cigar-like backdrop to it. The texture could be a bit more refined. The flavor could be a more balanced out as well.

Boulder Beer Igloo Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Boulder Beer Company;Had this beer on 12/10/2002 at Old Chicago on draft. Aroma is a nice lightly hopped malt scent. Color is a deep amber with good carbonation and head. Taste is spicy and hoppy. Starting with a good medium body it goes down with a mildly crisp feel. Finish is wonderful, coming on with a peppery malt taste that is back by a spicy hop flavor and nicely balanced bitterness. Its a nice winter but could have been bolder.
Boulder Beer Igloo Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Boulder Beer Company;"Color is a lovely chestnutty brown, with an enormous, crackly off-white head. Aroma is deep, rich, nutty, with additional notes of toffee and butterscotch. Medium body, just-right hops, perfect malt, terrifically tasty. Palate is luscious and fulfilling. Smooth, with just the right flavor to keep me happy until the end of the mug. Hops keep coming, and the warmth is welcome, especially on a Minnesota February night. A great one from Boulder, and I especially like the cute ice-skating cartoon penguins on the label. Reminds me of that adorable Hamm�s beer bear, ""from the land of sky-blue wa-a-ters/comes the beer refreshing"". Why aren�t there more beer cartoon character mascots anymore? Like good ol� Budman? What�s that? Who Camel?"
Boulder Beer Igloo Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Boulder Beer Company;This beer's appearance consisted of a large sized tan head with fine-small sized bubbles that was mostly diminishing.

The palate was tingly, thin and watery and medium bodied.
Boulder Beer Igloo Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Boulder Beer Company;This brew poured a medium sized head of fine to large sized long lasting light brown colored bubbles that left behind a softly carbonated hazy brown colored body and a poor lacing. The aroma is nice, but so mild and weak it is hard to rate it well. THere were notes of faint malt and something else that I could not put my finger on. Its mouthfeel was smooth and slightly hopped while its flavor was malty with a not well hidden alcohol note to it.
Boulder Beer Igloo Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Boulder Beer Company;Pours a dark brown witha nice fluffy head. Not enought hops or abv for a winter ale. Rather thin with very little to commend.
Boulder Beer Igloo Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Boulder Beer Company;Auburn/dark copper color, tan head. Great aroma of leafy and woody hops.

Nice roasty campfire smokey nose with a certain dark maltiness that�s roasty sweet but not smokey. Interesting. Crisp and dark malty flavor that�s a little campfire-ish but also dark malty sweet with a touch of raisin and plum, then the gently smokey tone comes back to calm it down. Brilliantly full but quaffable, smokey yet interesting enough to not be a one trick poney.
Bell's Batch 5000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Bell's Brewery;On tap at Star Bar. This is a deep, deep brown with a pervasive khaki head. Aroma has fruity yeast notes with brown sugar and smoked meat. The palate is full and creamy. Very nice meaty, smoky undertones throughout the flavor. It�s a sweet beer, for sure but it works. Hints of brown sugar, cola, no real hop character, and wood smoke. I can�t say I�ve had a smoked beer quite like this one and I definitely like it. I could stand it to be less sweet, but it�s delicious as it is.
Bell's Batch 5000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Bell's Brewery;Tap at hopcat. Aroma is smoked meat with mild brown sugar and caramel.

Humpty Dumpty Ferryman;Reedham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Humpty Dumpty Brewery;Unfortunately this reminded me too much of homebrew. The hopping seems understated and the body is thin and steely with a slight saltiness. I have some of their other beers to try in the next few weeks, hopefully with better success.
Zunft K�lsch;Wiehl-Bielstein, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Erzquell Brauerei Bielstein Haas & Co.;One of the best k�lsch i know, matterfact its made outside of cologne in the hills where good water resources (talsperren) build the base for the beer. It has a slight malty overweight (a little malzbier touch) but overall refreshing an good to trink. Tastes better from the cask than bottled. Its harder to get i think theres only one pub (refugium) in cologne where u can get it from the cask. In the hills its more popular.

Grand Ridge Natural Blonde;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Not the cloudy appearance that I tend to expect/like in a wheat beer. There was some yeast sediment but it was quite clear. An estery nose led to a slight banana flavor with a tingly and subtle citrusy mouthfeel. It includes coriander and orange but I could not detect the coriander and could barely taste/feel the orange citrus. Overall, an inoffensive wheat beer but nothing terribly special.

Vic., Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;"From a bottle poured a crystal clear amber with no head. carbonation extremely are, slow and medium to coarse.

Smooth and crisp with a short sweet finish. 27/5/2016 Poured a clouded straw colour with a one-finger bright white foamy head that retained very well but laced poorly. Carbonation high and fine. Aroma softly of spice/coriander and sweet fruit (orange, banana). Taste of spice/coriander and sweet fruit/banana. Light body. Smooth, slightly fizzy mouthfeel and with subtle spices on the finish. Typical wheat beer style."

Grand Ridge Natural Blonde;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Another possible dud from a variety 6 pack from this maker - on special so maybe the reason. Light honey aroma, very cloudy, no head, super sweet so I am thinking unfermented sugar in the bottle.

Grand Ridge Moonlight;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;Pale Ale - English;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;From a 330ml bottle on 27/3/2011. Pours a light amber with a massive head. Has a mild malty aroma. Has a heap of flavour for a beer that�s only 3.3% - mainly sharp burnt caramel and toffee malts, and a sharp and long almost lemony hop finish. The body is relatively thin. All up, this is pretty impressive for what is basically a light beer, and a bit under-rated on here.

Dick's Belgian Tripel;Centralia, Washington, United States;Tripel;Dick's Brewing Company;Reviewed 06/23/10 poured from bottle to new belgium tulip A: light amber color unusual for typically straw colored ale. Beer appears flat. No head, rare bottom origin bubbles. S: Light amber, crystal malt nose. Barely a touch of coriander typical in trippels. T: Poor exhibit of traditional trippel ale flavors. The ale tastes as though the yeast is not actually belgian, but belgianesque. M: Soft on tongue. Little carbonation. Crisp. D: Poor showing of a trippel. I don�t like trippel ales, and even I can say this is a poor showing. Serving type: bottle 12-20-2010

Dick's Belgian Tripel;Centralia, Washington, United States;Tripel;Dick's Brewing Company;A lightly sweet, lightly bready, balanced phenolic, spice, and light fruit/raisin, tripel. What struck me most was how middle of the road the yeast was for a Belgian, it had a little bit of everything, and was still very apparent. Good, appetizing. More grain for a tripel then I really would have expected, medium body too. In the vein of leffe blonde.
Dick's Belgian Tripel;Centralia, Washington, United States;Tripel;Dick's Brewing Company;Bottle served in a tulip. Pours watery clear orange. Short head, minimal lace. Aroma of yeast, bubblegum, and citrus. Later its light spice, apricots, alcohol, honey, and menthol-medicinal. Syrupy sweet and yeasty flavor.

Arbor Phat Abbot Belgian Dubbel;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Dubbel;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Bottle. Pours dark brown. Light tan head. Aroma of dark fruits and spices.

Sapporo Seven;Tokyo, Japan;Pilsener - Imperial;Sapporo Breweries;After tasting, this strong lager from Japan appears simply to be the regular Sapporo with the alcohol content turned up. However, the alcohol is not well-hidden, and lingers both on the palate and in the aftertaste. Though it's not as serious an issue here as some of the mainstream North America strong lagers, it does affect the taste--what little there is. It's a bland Sapporo-like taste. Not recommended unless you want the extra alcohol.

King Lager;Little River, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Australian Brewing Corporation;A rating from way back in 2006 found in an old notebook. Definitely the same beer, though I remember its bottle and label being a lot different from that shown on the left. Sample given to me by an importer. Chilled, into a Pilsner glass. Looks half decent, a mass of highly charged carbonation inside a yellowish gold body, clear as day. Big souffl� of white caps it off, slowly rising in the centre to a peak, impressive. This holds �til the end and laces the glass nicely. Grassy, dusty old bag of hops on the nose. Inoffensive on the palate, dull sourish malt with a mix of spicy, grassy and slightly sour hops in back. Hint of roasted peanut comes through, some herbal notes linger in the crispish . A little watery, body is light and it moves quickly across the tongue without great harm. Pretty average, nothing offensive at all. Easily quaffable, �mind-turned-off� lager! (33cL, 25/11/06, The Beer Store, Morley)
King Lager;Little River, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Australian Brewing Corporation;a pale amber color akin to apple juice, a big head to float a bottle cap, a strong malt aroma that grabs at the pit of your stomach, followed by a sweet carmel malt flavor. Just picked up a case at Shangy�s in Emmaus on a close out special for $13 so I shouldn�t bitch, but I will. Not really a summer brew, kind of heavy. Carbonation kind of went flat halfway through. I might use a bottle or two in my roasting pan to roast a couple of racks of ribs. I would skip this and get the Pigs Eye Pilsner for $13 in cans. Note: this was brewed and bottled in Australia, so maybe it should be paired with a Vegamite sandwich. 4.9% ABV.
King Lager;Little River, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Australian Brewing Corporation;375ml bottle. Poured pale yellow in colour with a medium white head and malt aroma. Very thin and watery and lacking in flavour. Average at best.

King Lager;Little River, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Australian Brewing Corporation;Aroma: some light malt and hop with a touch of melon.

King Lager;Little River, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Australian Brewing Corporation;very foamy almost soapy head. amber/gold color. aroma of malts and caramel. lots of soapy lacing left behind and a lot of carbonation. tastes of malt and a bit floral with a bitter after thought.

The taste is toasty, grainy, bitter - sweet, cereal,toffee, lemon / grapefruit rind and some age with a dry finish. Light - medium body and fine carbonation. Quite bizarre. I expected this old low - boost golde to be totally knackered. Yes it is aged, but the carbonation and body are still good. To confirm I did not get IBS from consuming this beer.

Millys Tavern Monarch Lager;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Not much more than your typical mass produced American Lagers. Nice appearance though - Clear golden colored topped with a thick head and a lot of lace left on the glass. Not much flavor there and it really wasn�t all that smooth. An okay beer I guess... After I tried it I found out that it was $1 a pint so what the hell, yeah, I�d get it again for a buck.

O�ujsko Bo�i�no Pivo;Zagreb, Croatia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Zagreba�ka Pivovara (Molson Coors);Probably the best beer in the whole assortiman of the Zagreba�ka pivovara brewery. If you have to choose what to drink in Zagreb, that�s the one.

Millys Tavern Amoskeag Harvest Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;not the most interesting drink in the world, but it serves its purpose. it fills the gap between their light beers and their darker beers, giving you the option to get something with more flavor than a fisher cat ale, but not too heavy.
Millys Tavern Amoskeag Harvest Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;This was drinkable but utterly blank. It had a slight everything. A slight aroma of hop and a slight taste that never became more than bland. Not offensive in any way but just a waste of time.

Adequate but moderate hopping. Very dry, no residual sugar, thin in the mouth. Although lightly hopped the finish is all hops because of how little malt is present. Enjoyable, like the others, and averagte, like the others.

Woods Woodcutter;Craven Arms, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Woods Brewery;Hand-pulled half-pint in a Shrewsbury Wetherspoons (Montgomery Towers) on 8th Dec 2014. Bright and clear amber body with a healthy white crown that gave off some impressive lacing. Malty, fruity, woody and nutty: roasted biscuit maltiness leads the way with the other flavours trying to assert themselves and prevent the beer becoming too sweet. Nice.

Three Needs Munich Helles;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"February 2002: On tap. One of this pub�s weakest offerings, with a thinnish pale headless pour, little nose, and an overcarbonated, slightly fruity (lemons, apples) flavor. Rather thin and watery. Avoid. 5/2/6/2/10 2.5 Fall-Winter 2006-2007. Have had many pints of this lately; don�t know if this version is JT�s recipe or new brewer Glen�s, but it�s been generally very solid, though better in the early fall. Very fresh, full-bodied, unfiltered, with lovely yeast profile, slightly on the hoppy side but still malt-dominated, a bit of vanilla and woody character at times, some nice dry herbal qualities. The best session beer at this brewpub over the past few months."

All Saints Belgian White;Dentergem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Riva Brouwerij (Duvel-Moortgat);27th April 2011 Old bottle from Kulminator, purchased 2008 when it was already old. Clear amber beer, small white head. Mild carbonation. Oxidised malt, not too strong. Trace amount of citrus left. Dry finish. Suspect this was a dull beer when it was released and ageing it has not improved it!
All Saints Belgian White;Dentergem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Riva Brouwerij (Duvel-Moortgat);Kulminator, a few years over time I think. Hazy white to amber coloured, some light carbonation and an average white head. Heavy sweet, madeira aroma. Full palate, sweet taste with again the somewhat older taste. Still little fruity near the end. Not bad, but would probably be much better when it where a younger version.
All Saints Belgian White;Dentergem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Riva Brouwerij (Duvel-Moortgat);"Dark gold with easily missed pistaccio shine; medium white head, fast gone. Very coloured malts nose, as in a functioning brewery. Maybe a bit old (no way of telling). Some oxidation, dry pine branches aroma. Oxydated taste, bit of liquorice, especially retronasal. No coriander, no citrus at all traceable. Sweet with just a little wheat-like sourish lining. Aftertaste is quite sweet - malty. Sticky, without really cloying. Strange. This is lightyears removed from Dentergemse witte which is what it should be by all reason. Prematurely aged? Probably, but can�t explain everything. But it is far from bad..."

Russian River Ragin River Ale;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Russian River Brewing;amber golden..no head..malty mustiness,lots of malts and no hops to be found anywhere..quite 1 dimensional and boring and too malty sweet..
Russian River Ragin River Ale;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Russian River Brewing;Thank you Vinnie for another fine ale. Good bronze to red hue with absolutely no head present...very very minimal lacing sticking around on the side of the glass. It grew on me with an aroma of fruit, malt and spicey sweetness. The taste threw something sour and sweet all at the same time at me. An excellent use of malts and a nice dryness made apparent by the fruity/maltness in the aftertaste made this a most enjoyable delicacy. The carbonation is fairly minimal, but just enough to give the tongue a good fruity prickling. Nicely done.
Russian River Ragin River Ale;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Russian River Brewing;Appreciable fruit, apple, citrus, faint clove, well built, crisp, clean, well balanced.

Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close, light hop bitterness in the close. Easy drinking affair but ultimately dull and muted in comparison to other beers in this style.

Third Street Aleworks Dortmunder Export;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Third Street Aleworks;Dark, coppery gold with a white head that quickly dissipated to a ring that eventually vanished itself. The aroma is very light malt and faint floweriness, but all very mild. The taste is a little stronger, being mild, somewhat sweet caramel malt at first, with pronounced hop bitterness balancing afterwards, some piney hop flavour, followed by a long, mellow, lightly toasted grain aftertaste. It is fairly crisp and refreshing, basically enjoyable, but it is a little too bitter for the relatively bland flavour and weak body. It�s ok, but not great.

Third Street Aleworks Old Redwood Porter;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Porter;Third Street Aleworks;This porter has deep, fairly rich colour, flavour, and body. This is (or was, I haven�t asked if it�s still made, but I haven�t seen it offered in about a year or more) a tasty, fairly heavy-duty, but well-balanced, smooth porter with good body. It has definite, strong coffee-chocolate flavours, but these are not overpowering and with a rasoty/malty flavour it has good balance.

Slightly watery nose hints at chocolate malt and straight roasted coffee beans without detour. Looking for more complexity in mouth doesn�t bring more comfort, a touch of nutskin may be noticeable with effort, but we�re mostly left with typical dark malts flavours, but the fruitiness and a smooth mouthfeel that is thin-medium with a lingering wateriness in the mostly short finish.

Humboldt Barley Wine;Arcata, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Humboldt Brewing Company;Thin-headed amber slightly darker than the El Toro.

Josef Hoffbauer Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;This is a terrible, bad tasting beer. Well, I rate it higher than the other Hoffbauer brews because its being a light beer doesn�t make it as offensive as the other Hoffbauer brews.
Josef Hoffbauer Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Non offensive, easy to drink, funky aroma, sorta like mich light , wouldn�t do again, just a cheep crappy beer...
Josef Hoffbauer Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;This Beer is the most amazing beer ever. First off, no matter how many I drank, more would just magically appear in the cooler. NEXT! My friend meg drank 2 of these puppies...next thing I knew, she was giving my Dick the 2 lip shimmy. Anyway, I love this beer and I also went on some jet skis, battled a snake and got that aforementioned BJ from my hot blonde friend meg (Before she got into all those Cleavland dudes)
Josef Hoffbauer Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;"Josef Hoffbauer Light is my favorite of all the lower priced, low carb, low-calorie beers (emphasis on the ""lower priced""). I moved to FL from GA about 2 years ago and haven�t been able to find it in my local area since, so I�m not a happy camper. Before giving it a bad review, why not throw a ""blind beer tasting party"" and invite a few friends, requesting that each bring a 6-pack of other light bodied beers, such as South Paw, Natural Light, Busch, Milwaukee�s Best, Miller, Bud, Coors, Michelob, Corona, Rolling Rock, etc. Anyone who prefers darker or extremely dark (what I call motor oil) beers shouldn�t participate in the ""light beer test"", as it wouldn�t be a fair assessment. If you designate 1 person as a tester to pour the different brands of light beers into shot glasses numbered by brand, then provide them to you (blindfolded, of course), and keep track of your feedback, then the tester gives you a 2nd round of the same beers in a different order, and records the results, you might just find that your preference is something other than what you thought you preferred, even if it isn�t Josef."
Josef Hoffbauer Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;I lover beer. I HATE Josef Hofbauer. Hard to tell whats worse, this or PBR. If you want a light lager, dig in your couch for the extra 1.50 and get Coors or Miller.
Josef Hoffbauer Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;A light bit of flavor in this light beer. But pretty much overly watery and grainey with some sour metal in the finish.
Josef Hoffbauer Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;a taed better than the original...its ok for a light that is bought to be drunk in mass
Josef Hoffbauer Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Very pale yellow with lots of carbonation. Some aromas of sweet grains. Actually has some very distant malt flavors that most others in this category lack. Harsh, sour aftertaste. Not a bad cheap beer choice.
Josef Hoffbauer Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;"Have you notice that only people that rate once, and never again give these swill beers a 5? Yes it�s cheap, yes it gets you drunk. It smells like nothing, tastes like someone took a dump in the beer vat. The metallic nasty taste...man what are you people thinking about giving this a 5. I know what you�re going to say ""you beer snobs don�t know anything about this great cheap ass beer. I got it for 99 cents a 30 pack. It tastes better than miller and bud, and I got wasted as hell"" Give me a break. If I could give this nut sweat a 0 out of 5 I would, but since this rating system only goes down to 0.5 that�s what It�ll be."
Josef Hoffbauer Light;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;For a low carb beer, compared to some of the others out there, old Josef here is really good. It goes down easy and does not have a bad after taste. I like to put a lime in it for some added flavor, but it is a great summertime barbeque beer or for those who do not want to spend a bunch. Get a twelve pack for under 5 bucks and see how it kicks the asses of the other beers under 5 bucks.

Just white bread, mild spiciness. Moderate bitter taste, light to moderate sweet, mild bite. Medium body, kind of slick. Light kind of soft carbonation, mild roughness. Clear golden color, minimal ring of white head. A decent blond ale... Should satisfy those looking for a macro light lager (which I assume is the intention here)."
Blackhorse Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Watery. Not much to it. This is what they brew for the Budweiser fingers that come in.
Blackhorse Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;This is kind of a Miller Lite knock off with more kick. Hazy yellow in color, heavy on the yeast in the taste. Has a bitter backers.

Blackhorse Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Sampled at Knoxville location. This is not amber by any stretch of the imagination. Pale yellow, thin head. Smells grainy, grassy, and some cardboard notes. Grainy, grassy, corny flavor, with a hint of piney hops in the finish. Seriously, this is either a golden ale or of those beers that brewpubs call a Kolsch but really isn�t a Kolsch, they just call it that because they want a fancy name for their lightest beer.
Blackhorse Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Smells real bad. Tons of butter/butterscotch. Very pale yellow. This is a poor beer. Generic pale lager with funky butter to it. A thin metal finish. Off to a terrible start in the sampler set.
Blackhorse Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;On tap at the Blackhorse Pub & Brewery- Beer served had a pale yellow color and a light head. The aroma was bland with a hint of grain. The taste was generic light taste that does not inspire and the finish was light a bit watery. This is typical bland non offensive beer. Respectable drink for someone used to BMC macros.
Blackhorse Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Appearance: Faintly hazy, pale straw-colored body with a small, fizzy, white head. Smell: Nose of light pale malts riddled with buttery diacetyl and maybe a few hints of floral hops. There�s really not much beyond the butter though. Taste: Very mild, lightly sweet malt character that, when teamed up with buttery diacetyl, gives the impression of honey butter. Which is fine for a piece of toast, but becomes hard to bare by the end of the glass. Almost no hop presence and certainly no bitterness to cut through the butteriness, letting the taste ride out from start to finish. Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium-low carbonation. Drinkability: Butter up! I�ll be spending a few days in Clarksville, TN visiting my dear friend Fifi and the brewpub that time (or at least the online beer community) forgot. And with this inauspicious, butter-soaked start, it�s not hard to imagine why.
Blackhorse Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Light whitish yellow with a lasting white foam. Aroma is lightly sweet malt, a vanilla sweetness. Taste is sweet malt, watery, metallic. Light sour note in the finish.
Blackhorse Barnstormer Red;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Bottle: Clear, bubbled amber with a huge, light tan head. Caramel, cream/milk scent. Taste is caramel malt.....sweet, but lightly (at first) lacticity. Starts ok....but the lactic notes get a little sharp after a while.....other than that, not much stands out in this one.

Blackhorse Barnstormer Red;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Can. Lactic acid/butter, caramel malt and hay aroma. Amber with moderate light tan head. Mildly sweet caramel malt and mildly bitter dry hay flavor. Decent body. Okay.

Blackhorse Barnstormer Red;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;12 ounce can poured into a snifter. The beer is a clear amber color with a beige head that dissipates quickly. Very quickly. No lacing. The aroma has notes of spice cake and caramel. The taste is fairly sweet and caramelly, but also gets somewhat leathery. Kind of an odd beer. I get a bunch of vanilla as well. Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Decent.
Blackhorse Barnstormer Red;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Bottle. Amber in color with a medium head. Aroma is grains, very slight hints of a resin and bread. Taste was a tad caramel up front well balanced in the middle with a slightly sweet finish. Just kind of middle of the road.
Blackhorse Barnstormer Red;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Can. Pours a foggy amber color with a thick off white head. Strong, malty aroma with a hint of citrus in the background. Sweet taste. Some citrus notes with a strong malt presence. Not a bad amber ale.
Blackhorse Barnstormer Red;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;4oz on tap at the brewpub. Labeled 6%. Interesting biscuity malt flavor. Spicy malt, touch of citrus, caramel malt. Medium body. Smooth, kind of soft, lighter carbonation. More dry finish. Sort of a full feel. Mostly clear orange red color. Thin off-white head, leaving decent bits of lace. Moderate sweet taste, lighter bitter. Mild bite in the finish. An alright red ale.
Blackhorse Barnstormer Red;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Had this one back in the 90s on tap and didn�t really care for it so much. They�ve recently started bottling and canning, so I bought a 12 oz. can to give it another shot. It pours a hazy orange-amber and has a lasting thin disc of creamy foam on top. Smells very sweet with caramel and butterscotch. Tastes the same on the front. Later turns show some mild sour apple, toast and vanilla biscuit notes. There�s nearly enough dry grass and wooden hop on the finish to balance. Mouthfeel is nice with soft, lightly tingly carbonation for the light-medium body. There are some interesting flavors here, but overall just way too sweet to be very enjoyable. This brewery has recently upped its game a bit with some fine seasonals and high gravity one-offs, but sadly the staple beers such as this one remain the same as ever.

Blackhorse Coalminers Stout;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Stout;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;"Draft pint many times. Pitch black with a lasting ring of bubbles. Nose is char, milk chocolate, caramel and light resiny herb. Taste is the same as the aroma promises. Medium-heavy body is drinkably watery and has light carbonation. This was actually the first beer I had with vanilla ice cream as a ""beer float"", about 20 years ago and it still makes my innards flutter with anticipation, or something else. This is definitely the brewery�s best beer in their regular lineup."

Blackhorse Sherrie's Nut Brown Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Brown Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;This is an ale and its brown. So far, so good. Aroma is a mix of chestnuts and hops.

Blackhorse Raspberry Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Pinkish orange, thin but dense white head. Smells like raspberry jam - surprisingly not artificial. Taste is not quite as natural, though, but still raspberry plus some toasty flavors. Better than I was expecting...
Blackhorse Raspberry Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Some raspberry but a bit of juice/funk in the aroma as well. Slightly orange color. Ooh, this is a case of tasting better than it looks/smells. Almost like a mix of cherries and raspberries. Not syrupy at all. Smooth and easy to drink. I was amazed at how tasty I found this.
Blackhorse Raspberry Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Tap @ Blackhorse. Cloudy light gold pour with a white head leaving a fine coating of lace. Nose indicates trouble as it smells like a raspberry gumball or a raspberry cough drop. Body is very light with fine, medium carbonation. Not very well integrated, there is a sucrose fruity sweetness, then a light toastiness and a short finish. This is raspberry jelly on toast and too sweet in the balance. Even fruit beer lovers should avoid this one.
Blackhorse Raspberry Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Appearance: Lightly hazy, pale-hued, straw-colored body with a small-sized, white head. Smell: Though some slight malt accents are present, it�s essentially only the raspberry additive. Taste: Incredibly light malt base and then it�s off to the smooth, though light raspberry flavoring. The altogether mild carbonation allows this lackluster taste to just languish on the tongue. So, with the light malt profile and non-existent hops, all you have is this raspberry taste from start till merciful finish. Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied. Low carbonation. Drinkability: I�m very pleased Blackhorse�s issues with diacetyl ended here, as I wasn�t particularly looking forward to the idea of raspberry flavoring and diacetyl�s buttery off-flavor. Though, the beer still didn�t perform too well for me -- in that the predominate flavor present (raspberry flavoring, natch) was still rather mild and the carbonation was just missing, leaving the beer to come across as a flavored water, like something Dasani would put out on the market. Ah well, they can�t all be a New Glarus Raspberry Tart.
Blackhorse Raspberry Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Hazy yellow, whitish head. Aroma is pale malt, sour note, spiciness like a hefe with a touch of raspberry syrup. Taste is again a light sourness, pale malt, the raspberry is really lost here.
Blackhorse Raspberry Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Not a good brew. Way overcarbed, tastes a bit like raspberry cough syrup. Almost tastes like the grains were over spraged or old extract was used. Glad I only had a small taster glass.
Blackhorse Scottish Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Scottish Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Bottle: Cloudy brown with a creamy beige head. Cola, caramel, woody scent. Sweet, tangy, caramel-apple taste. Runs a lit little hot and boozy towards the finish..... Not bad, but grows a bit rough after a bit.
Blackhorse Scottish Ale;Clarksville, Tennessee, United States;Scottish Ale;Blackhorse Pub & Brewery;Bottle. Rock candy, light apple, toffee malt, and fresh grass aroma.

Pleasant aroma of chocolate and caramel with a touch of coffee. Tastes of earthy cafe mocha, toffee, and touches of tart berry and graham cracker. Medium body has a very nice balance and a smooth, average level of carbonation. Rich and malty per the style, but never gets sticky and would be a nice 2-3 pint sessioner.

Appearance is clear pale yellow with a small white head. Aroma of grass, cereal and mineral notes. Taste is light sweet and light bitter. Palate is light bodied, watery texture and average carbonation. The beer is okay considering it is a gluten-free lager (and also the oldest mass-produced one as far as I know). I give extra points for including the specific nutritional values on the label. The whole 500ml can is ""only"" 150kcal and 7.5gram sugar, which makes this the best nutritional values I have seen in a gluten-free beer. But I think the beer tastes a little too sweet anyway considering the measly 4.1% ABV, they could have upped the ABV and lessened the sweetness."

Maybe a year. Not the freshest obviously, but it�s a beer and it�s hot outside. Not really much to say about it. It pours out a light orange/yellow color, bright white head with a cloudy body. Aroma is lightly musty lemon rind, a bit of cracker and a hint of banana. All very muted though. Body is lightly sweet, overripe/mushy pears, wet paper..blech.

MacTarnahans Uncle Ottos Weiss Beer;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);From a 12 oz. long neck brown bottle with no bottled/freshness date. Poured a hazy golden hued orange with a foamy white head that settled into a thin lacing. Aromas of lemon fruity esters, clove and grain bready. Medium carbonation and a crisp, smooth lightish medium bodied mouthfeel. Pleasant tasting, lemon with a touch of pear fruitiness, clove and spices, and a mild grain breadiness, a nice crispness from malts balanced a lightly soft spicy hop bitterenss, good drinkability, very quaffable. This was better than what I expecting, crisp and refreshing.
MacTarnahans Uncle Ottos Weiss Beer;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);This was quite tasty, great wheat flavors and some interesting yeastiness. Did not have a strong fruit presence, like I would have expected instead it came across as being more herbal and clove, almost some licorice. Something was definitely different, but other than that, this is a great easy to drink, hefe that goes down really smooth.
MacTarnahans Uncle Ottos Weiss Beer;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle and served in my generic hefe glassware: Pours a cloudy straw yellow hue with an initial frothy head that fades and produced little lace. The aroma has lots of lemon and clove but minimal banana esters or wheat for that matter, a bit grassy and noble hops come about. The taste does not cut it as a hefeweizen, sure it is better than most American wheats and has a crisp tartness but little else of what I like in the style is present. Yeasty on the finish and some lingering bitterness. The feel is refreshing and crisp, so it is drinkable. Back to some real Bavarian hefes...this is a one try bier.
MacTarnahans Uncle Ottos Weiss Beer;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours hazy dark straw with sourish hopcit and fruit aroma. Not as complex or balanced as other hefes I�ve had.
MacTarnahans Uncle Ottos Weiss Beer;Portland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle: Aroma is all citrus and sour with some cloves. Very, very faint banana. Pours a dull, slightly hazy orangish-yellow with lots of sediment. Very small head that is gone quickly. No lacing whatsoever. Flavor is very malty. Very slight touch of citrus in the beginning. Strong banana and moderate clove finish. While flavor is more weak that most hefes, there is a stronger banana finish and aftertaste than I�ve ever had which contradicts the aroma. Not bad, but the lack of citrus flavor (only slightly noticeable in the front part of the flavor) makes this hefe fall a little short. Oh, and the commercial description for th is beer is ridiculous. I'll try not to let that affect my rating.

Six Rivers IPA;McKinleyville, California, United States;IPA;Six Rivers Brewery;Bottle. Very dark, reddish brown. Thick malt, full of toffee and caramel.

Six Rivers High Prairie Wheat;McKinleyville, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Six Rivers Brewery;(Draft: Six Rivers Brewery in McKinleyville, CA) This is a pretty generic, light bodied wheat beer in the American style, neither offensive nor something to rave about. Standard wheat flavor is accompanied by a moderate citrus flavor and gentle bitterness. Hardly any aroma to this beer though, even with this tall, narrow glass. Pale straw color, slightly cloudy in appearance, with a small, rapidly diminishing white head that leaves just a few spots of lace on the glass. So, nothing special here, but very drinkable, and certainly a decent beer for a style that tends to yield plenty of disappointing brews.

LaConner India Pale Ale;LaConner, Washington, United States;IPA;LaConner Brewing Company;12 oz bottle courtesy of brewolf. Thanks Michael. Pours a cloudy amber color with a small white head that slowly recedes to a fine film. The aroma is dominated by caramel, and that�s really all I got.

This comes off as a winter warmer, not as a (British) brown ale -- I had to take a sip of my father�s Tannenbaum ale to be sure that this wasn�t a mistake.

LaConner Brown Ale;LaConner, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;LaConner Brewing Company;Rich and tasty brown ale, but far too sweet for me.

LaConner Doppelbock;LaConner, Washington, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;LaConner Brewing Company;I've always been particularly fond of LaConner, the brewery that gave us Tennenbaum and a lovely IPA, but this didn't seem to have that LaConner flair. Having a very large malt profile, this seemed almost too standard. Big carmelly body and the burnt sugar aftertaste. This, however, did not have that undesirable metallic zing so many malt bombs like this are akin too, which is good. Just really too characteristic of the variety, too un LaConner-ish. - (Yeah, I just had another one, still the same. My first rating was dead on.)
LaConner Doppelbock;LaConner, Washington, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;LaConner Brewing Company;Deep reddish amber with a decent wheaten head and speckled lace. Aroma is light with sherry-like tones and a touch of caramel sweetness. Flavor is assertive but syrupy sweet with trace molasses tang--a bit medicinal. Hops provide trace dryness in the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy, the sensation exacerbated by the uni-dimensional malt profile and the lack of any top-end presence to provide a counterbalance...This has no shortage of flavor, but is decidedly lacking in balance and complexity...a bit of a disappointment from this brewery.

LaConner Oktoberfest;LaConner, Washington, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;LaConner Brewing Company;(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with Larry Pitonka, thanks Andr�!) I think I�ve totally lost faith that this brewery can put out anything good anymore. First off, this beer smells pretty brutal. I mean really, it�s smells like soured, rotting vegetables, not too different from rotten tomatoes in a compost bin. And I have to make this distinction clear, I don�t mean sour as in tart, but sour as in rotten. With the apparency of a very toasty and woody maltiness, the flavor is at least somewhat better, but not much because those putrid, rotten vegetables have ransacked the flavor as well, giving it a general soured (again, not tart) character. The beer is minimally sweet, which is pretty unusual, but I�m okay with that. Moderately bitter hops also makes a showing, and who knows, maybe the hops had spoiled for this batch. Body is medium and carbonation is average, but this is little solace. And I�ve never poured an Oktoberfest where the bottom of the bottle was lined with a dense layer of sludge. The resulting pour, even with the sludge still sticking to the bottle, is a very cloudy but bright orange color. Off-white head fails to rise above a quarter inch in height and quickly settles to a thin ring. Honestly, despite a few desperate glimpses of something positive to grab ahold of, this has truly been a disgusting, revolting beer in just about every respect.
LaConner Oktoberfest;LaConner, Washington, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;LaConner Brewing Company;Nice, rusty-orange hue. Creamy-soft texture with a nice carbonation level. Interesting injection of sourness. Malts were complete with sweet caramel and moderately toasted bread. Some acidity cleaved off the sweetness nicely. Zingy hops with a woodsy-earthy bitterness followed. Overall, pretty good Oktoberfest � not too sweet, and more interesting than your average, bland-tasting session Oktoberfest.
LaConner Oktoberfest;LaConner, Washington, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;LaConner Brewing Company;Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium amber. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, cookie), lightly hoppy (flowers, apricot). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Uninteresting and kinda sour, but ok.
LaConner Oktoberfest;LaConner, Washington, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;LaConner Brewing Company;Pours a murky red color, small white head. Aroma is sweet and malty, some dark fruit in the nose as well. Flavor is smooth and sweet. Excellent balance and very easy to drink.
LaConner Oktoberfest;LaConner, Washington, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;LaConner Brewing Company;Bottle Pours a hazy deep copper with a small off white head and thin creamy lacing.

LaConner Oktoberfest;LaConner, Washington, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;LaConner Brewing Company;Bottle pours a red amber, with virtually no head. Very malty, but not as sweet as other Fest-Marzens. Spicy taste throughout, and I agree with the previous observation of a peppery hop character. Love the style, and this is a good entry. Prost to lagering!
LaConner Oktoberfest;LaConner, Washington, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;LaConner Brewing Company;Copper with a thick foamy head. Some lace and lively carbonation.

LaConner Tannenbaum Ale;LaConner, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;LaConner Brewing Company;"Draught at the brewpub, 10 oz Dark amber to brown color, cloudy, with small head. The aroma is not much developed; it had a solid malt and caramel flavor, and orangey resiny hops. I would prefer less yeast presence, but it�s a good beet anyway."
LaConner Tannenbaum Ale;LaConner, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;LaConner Brewing Company;2/25/12. Bottle shared at RBWG 2012. Dark brown pour with a small head. Bold, rich, fruity aroma with plenty of dark fruits, brown sugar, and molasses. Even richer flavor with sweet caramels, brown sugar, molasses, and dark fruits. Not bad!
LaConner Tannenbaum Ale;LaConner, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;LaConner Brewing Company;12oz bottle from riversideAK, thanks Alex. Rating #71. Dark amber with a pinch of orange thrown in there, the head was slightly off-white and held up pretty well, lacing was minimal and spotty, but what was left stuck around for a bit. Sweet and a little spicy candy like aroma, some caramel, maybe a bit of cinnamon. Flavor was similar, light sweetness and a bit of alcohol, but it was a smooth alcohol and pretty good. (1344)

LaConner Tannenbaum Ale;LaConner, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;LaConner Brewing Company;Many thanks to Eric for the 2003 bottle! Poured deep, hazy mahogany with a short cap of beige head (mostly a loose-bubbled ring). The aroma picked up sweet, toasty molasses, honey, and cane sugar with oxidation providing complexity rather than hurting the experience.. sticky-sweet and malty, with any semblance of hops long gone. The flavor found molasses, honey, and rum character at the core, laced with dry black peppery alcohol and some oxidation.. sticky on the finish with a warm, boozed up brownie impression.. tasty stuff! Medium-bodied with low carbonation on the palate.. nicely warming and spicy.. this held up very well with age, and to me was a better version of Anchor OSA.
LaConner Tannenbaum Ale;LaConner, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;LaConner Brewing Company;Do I detect butter? The �rum-like� flavors and winter release lead me into more of a festive butter rum note, along with some pine and marshmallow. Dark caramel in the glass, light tan head. Stale malt, dusty middle, warming copper finish. Initially rated lower, but it grew on me to become a 3. 010311 This bottle has a year on it and there�s a little infected nose. Remains drinkable with ample pine.

Yankee Jim Ice Strong Beer;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Hole Brewing Company;This beer came up far easier than it went down. I took 3 swigs of the bitter chemical liquid, but couldn�t swallow more than 2 without retching, which doesn�t exactly give one enough for a proper review. Reminiscent of a FAXE variation I tried years ago with similar outcome. Should not even be in the category of rateable beers.
Yankee Jim Ice Strong Beer;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Hole Brewing Company;Pours pale with a thin ring of fizzy bubbles. Tastes watery and bland with a stray hop or two in the finish.
Yankee Jim Ice Strong Beer;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Hole Brewing Company;I drank this when it first came out in Alliston, On. 7.25 for a sixer at a whopping 6.5%. I drank 3/4 of a 24 of Yankee that night at my folks place. The next morning - my mother came down and told me I looked like a ghost. These comments must have made there way to the brewery via the union of Mothers. It�s now 7.95 and 5.5% Drop Bombz

Yankee Jim Ice Strong Beer;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Hole Brewing Company;Good party beer to get drunk with.......not too much going on in the way of taste, however.
Yankee Jim Ice Strong Beer;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Hole Brewing Company;Pretty terrible. smells like sweet corn water. taste is bland, but then some unusual flavour hits you and stays for a long time. just bad.
Yankee Jim Ice Strong Beer;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Hole Brewing Company;Can (355ml) Imagine my delight when I spied this gem at the bottom of the lcbo singles barrel - the other Yankee Jim! I get to rate both! Maybe this one will taste like beer ... Poured a bright light gold, slightly hazy,with a large white foamy head. Smelled like corn mash with added sugar and root veggie compost - either I caught a whiff of very stale hops or it had started to react with the can lining. Tasted pretty nothing - weak corn, very sweet, somewhat metallic, nothing I would call either malt or hops - maybe a bit like potato scrapings. As it warms both the aroma and the taste get unbelievably harsh, which at least gives this sucker some character. Mouthfeel is polluted water. I�m off to eat a slice of stinky cheese to cleanse my palate.
Yankee Jim Ice Strong Beer;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Hole Brewing Company;355ml can. Gold pour, retained a small white head. Aroma is sweet, sugar and corny. Flavours of metal and corn. Thin stagnant body. Awful. Side note: No Fun by The Stooges came up randomly on the mp3 player as soon as I cracked open this can... coincindence...? It was no fun.
Yankee Jim Ice Strong Beer;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Hole Brewing Company;Can with Tiggmtl and Muzzlehatch 4/17/05. Not sure how this one is rated higher than the Genuine Draft, as I found it to be nearly undrinkable, full of lightly sour veggies and crushed bricks. Corn, metal, hints of malt. Darker yellow appearance, less head, clear and slight alcohol notes are present as well. Light body, fizzy mouthfeel. I�ll stick to the YJGD, thank you.

Back Road Midwest IPA 2005 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;IPA;Back Road Brewery;On tap at the brewery. A dark copperish read hue with a ligh dusting of head. Well balanced aroma of caramel malts and piney hops. Lots of hop flavor with that actually out works that bitterness with is by no means an afterthought. Medium bubbly mouthfeel. I find that IPAs are like sex. Even when they are bad, they are still pretty good.
Back Road Midwest IPA 2005 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;IPA;Back Road Brewery;On tap at the Heston Bar: Pours a clear copper with a puffy and long-lasting white head. Aroma has lots of citrus grapefruity hops with a touch of caramel malt underneath. Body starts with a touch of sweetness and some diacetyl and plenty of hoppy bitterness toward the dry finish.
Back Road Midwest IPA 2005 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;IPA;Back Road Brewery;bottle from wohlfs. at first glance (sniff?) this is a decent IPA. some citrusy pacific northwest hops and also some dusty english goldings/fuggles style hops dominate the aroma, and they also dominate the flavor. not well-balanced: strong hops and strong malt, but there�s no cooperation between the two. this is an excellent effort, just doesn�t have the potential to be anything better than good.
Back Road Midwest IPA 2005 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;IPA;Back Road Brewery;Good IPA. I like the pine hoppiness throught the drink on top of a light sweet caramel maltiness. I even get some apricot from the hopping. Despite the commercial braggadocio , I like to see a LOT more bitterness in my IPA.
Back Road Midwest IPA 2005 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;IPA;Back Road Brewery;Fresh growler from the brewery. Light hazy, amber body with a thick, puffy cream head. Earthy, musty, herbal aroma with a touch of pine. Creamy, bready, toasty body with plenty of earthy, herbal hops kick. Thin-medium bodied, creamy, and soft with a light aftertaste. Clean and quaffable.
Back Road Midwest IPA 2005 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;IPA;Back Road Brewery;Another great back road beer. It has a very odd taste, but i really do like it. nice head on it and is easy to drink.
Back Road Midwest IPA 2005 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;IPA;Back Road Brewery;Not overwhelming, but a nicely hopped up, enjoyable IPA. Hazy orange in body, it sports a rocky off-whitw head that laces the glass heavily as you drink. With a mild caramel malt beneath, the aroma is predominantly grapefruit and pine hop scents. The caramel backbone supports some fine hop bitterness, and this finishes on a long, piney hop note. Very good.
Back Road Midwest IPA 2005 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;IPA;Back Road Brewery;Bottle courtesy of Wohlfs, and I�ll agree with the strange aroma and flavor. Maybe a little metallic/acidic, not quite sure but there is something going on in this brew. Just o.k.
Back Road Midwest IPA 2005 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;IPA;Back Road Brewery;Bottle. Nice hopppy aroma of citrus fruits with a thick, lasting head which produced nice lacing throughout. Clear amber color. Taste is mostly on the pine side with some toased malts. Not great but enjoyable.
Back Road Midwest IPA 2005 (and earlier);La Porte, Indiana, United States;IPA;Back Road Brewery;Bottle: Decent hop and lots of malt aroma almost give it a light orange juice smell. Pours a mostly transparent orange, just a slight haze. Small off-white head. Nice lacing. While the aroma is very malty, not a ton of malt in the flavor. Real big hop finish is more pine than citrus. With so much hops and very little malt, balance needs improving. Thanks to wolhfs.
Barley's Bavarian Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Barley's Brewing Company;Draft at Alehouse #1 - Pours cloudy pale with a short white head that leaves some lace. Aromas of citrus, bannana, and bubblegum and yeast. Flavor is bannana, a touch of clove, and lemon. Light and airy on the palate and very flavorful for a light brew. Enjoyable.

Amarit NB;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Thailand;Golden color with a fizzy off-white head. Musty malt and caramel aromas. A bit of earth and wood as well in the nose. Stale malt, rust and bits of salt in the flavors. Watery feel.
Amarit NB;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Thailand;***review form mid 2008*** Yet another beer from the Undrinkable International Box of Unsold Beers Bleh... poured out a icky yellow beer with large bubbs and a quick death head. Smells of corn and sweet stuff of one kind or another and skunk rectum. The taste was too sweet and a bit metallic to along with yuck-o grains. Rough mouth feel, light bodied, finishes as quick as possible...
Amarit NB;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Thailand;"This is just plain and simply a beer, nothing special about it and nothing so bad its stands out either. It looks like you every day mass produced lager there is a bit o a metallic skunky smell and lots of carbonation. Slightly sweet tasting for a lager and a good amount of hoppieness. There�s just really nothing good or bad that makes this beer stand out, it�s just a beer."""
Amarit NB;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Thailand;Yeah, I can totally see why Singh is Thailand�s best beer. I really cant be bothered to write about this very poor lager.
Amarit NB;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Thailand;Yuck! Is this for real? Green bottle let�s it get skunky...or I hope it�s skunky and not the way it usually is. Poor poor Thai people who are subjected to this. Light in skunky flavor, light in color, no real head. Please stay clear, don�t bother. Wish I could have that 1.50 back.
Amarit NB;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Thailand;A golden lager with a thin white head. Aroma is light sweet and corny, very mineral. In mouth, a perfume sweet beer with light metallic hops, very short in mouth. Cloying. Bottle from Piscator,MLCC.
Barley's Brown Lion Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Barley's Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a dark amber color with a finger�s worth of white foamy head that fell off at a good pace. Slight lace. The aroma had some sweet nuts, good roastiness, light toast, mellow milk chocolate, super light dark chocolate, some coffee bean. Ended with some earthy hops. The flavor blended all of the prior mentioned aromas together nicely and bringing about a nice aftertaste of the same. Semi-dry sort of malty finish. The feel was about medium bodied with a decent sessionability about it. Sly carbonation. ABV felt fine. Overall, nicely done brown ale worthy of having again.
Barley's Brown Lion Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Barley's Brewing Company;Good hearty Malt aroma. Hints of hazelnuts. Beautiful dark color with nice head. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Wonderful flavor. Great beer.

Barley's Auld Curiosity Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap, poured into a shaker. The aroma consists of molasses, plum, raisin, caramel, and coffee. It�s a murky plum raisin hue with a soapy gelatin tan head that retains a medium thin, dense ring, a light, splotch surface, and leaves abundant sheer and web lace. The taste is a mellow, medium high sweet and medium bitter. It�s thick and full with a creamy fizz carbonation. There�s a burnt quality to it with primary flavors of bread and raisin and undertones of toffee nd dark chocolate that sticks around in the burnt finish with a light grass touch and some molasses. The aftertaste lingers with burnt notes of bread crust and dark chocolate.

Barley's Auld Curiosity Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;Barley's Brewing Company;"Thanks to hopdog for passing this growler onto me. Pours a mostly hazy deep amber with a medium off white head that left tons of lacing. Aroma of spicy noble hops, caramel, toasted malt, floral notes, light chocolate notes, surprised at how hoppy this was...but more noble than ""citrusy"". Flavor of some resiny hops, moderate hop bitterness, toffee, nuts, toasted malt and grapefruit. This was interesting...not sure I would really consider it an altbier."

It pours a dark, opaque, deep mahogany brown color with a dense bubbled, medium thin ring with a wispy surface and a light lace. The taste is a medium high sweet and bitter combination. It�s a thick, creamy, and sticky texture with a soft fizz carbonation. The medium full malty body contains smokey notes and a slight ash quality with coffee and lots of chocolate. It finishes surprisingly clean with notes of chocolate and nuts.

Barley's Alexander's Russian Imperial Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;Barley's Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewpub. This is almost black. Roasted flavor arrives first with anise, chocolate, and fruit after. Grains and big malts give this plenty of body, flavor, and interesting stuff. Quite nice.
Barley's Alexander's Russian Imperial Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;Barley's Brewing Company;Taster on tap at Barley�s. Dark brown color, kind of clear. Thin tan head, leaves good thicker lace. Good bigger roasty flavor, some coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruit. Light tobacco. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, kind of crisp, lighter carbonation. Lightly slick. Some might say it�s slightly thin compared to other imperial stouts. Moderate bitter taste, light sweet. Very light bite on the end. Decent imperial stout... Good assertive roasty bitter hoppy flavor on it, good earthy hop.. Could use a little more malt and body though maybe. First impression is better than the last. Wears a bit.
Barley's Alexander's Russian Imperial Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;Barley's Brewing Company;Great for a tiny brewery. A bit light in terms of body, color, taste, and abv for an RIS, but very tasty. Chocolately.

Barley's Centennial India Pale Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;IPA;Barley's Brewing Company;on tap @ Smokehouse / Columbus OH --- Nearly clear light amber color, off-white head, dots and spots of lace. Taste is straight malt that moves through a fizzy swallow to a finish that takes a long time to show hops. 71 IBU? It doesn�t seem likely.
Barley's Centennial India Pale Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;IPA;Barley's Brewing Company;A nice clean drinking centennial IPA with the associated citrusy aromas and flavors. Not world-beating, but it doesn�t have to be in their solid lineup.
Barley's Centennial India Pale Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;IPA;Barley's Brewing Company;draft at brewery,, very close to two hearted, a little lighter and less sweet which I like much more than two hearted. Very clean and nice finish, a very easy drinker.

Barley's Pilsner;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Barley's Brewing Company;Quite a nice crisp and clean pilsener. I had Tipopils last week and while this beer is no Tipopils it�s also far more friendly to the typical drinker�s palate. Most breweries cannot make subtle beer this good.
Barley's Pilsner;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Barley's Brewing Company;I had this on tap at the brewpub. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a glossy orange to ruddy red. A bar pour�s kind of head dissipated within about a quick twenty seconds. The smell had a sweet German malt, fairly authentic. The taste took the German malt to sweeten and roll adequately into the aftertaste and leave a nice wet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation seemed good for the style and for me. Overall, I say this was a pretty good German pilsener, pass the bratwurst!
Barley's Pilsner;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Clear golden with medium fluffy bright white head. Aroma is light pilsner malt, light body, light/medium carbonation, and pretty good thin small-bubble lacing. Taste is pilsner malt and crisp hops. Not bad for what it is.

Soft aroma of malts and fruited hops. Sulfur hop notes are tasted along with pale malts. It is just a bit soapy tasting but is a nice puls. Some spice and floral.

Barley's J. Scott Francis ESB;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap poured into a shaker. The aroma is caramel and bread. It pours an oily, orange copper color with a gelatin soft, off white head retaining a thin ring and light, dusty surface that leaves a good sheet lace. The beer is lightly bitter with a rich medium sweet. The beer is syrupy, but thinnish, and smooth, with a soft, creamy carbonation. The medium body is bready and citrusy with undertones of caramel. It finishes with citrus and toffee leaving a waxy, astringent aftertaste that�s bitter with bread crust and citrus peel.
Barley's J. Scott Francis ESB;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap at the downtown brewpub. Clear golden with nice off-white head.

Barley's J. Scott Francis ESB;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barley's Brewing Company;I don�t even like the style...but this is fantastic. Granted it is a very Americanized version of the British style, but I feel it has finally been done right.
Barley's J. Scott Francis ESB;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barley's Brewing Company;Poured on draft. Hazy gold to copper color with a sticky white head of foam.

Barley's J. Scott Francis ESB;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap at Barleys Ale House #1, Columbus OH, on 12 March 2010. Amber colour. No head. Very little condition. Sweetish. Lots of caramel malt character. Also had some sour notes and a little toilet cleaner / bleach. Not very impressed. A bit sickly. I wonder whether this was a bit stale as other reviews seem very positive. In fact, although I didn�t note it at the time I suspect this was actually from a cask that was past its best. Will try again if I ever get back to Barleys.
Barley's J. Scott Francis ESB;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap at the Alehouse. Pours a clear reddish copper with a medium beige head. Light aroma of English malt and dank earthy hop. English malt flavor with caramel and a semi-bitter finish.
Barley's J. Scott Francis ESB;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barley's Brewing Company;Objectively speaking: An alright ESB which I was sure I had mistaken for another when I saw this was one of the USA�s ahemm... the world�s highest rated. I like: I must say it was possibly the finest glass I had at Barley�s number 1. Nize hazy orange looks. Fitting very lightly carbonated texture. Good balance between sweetness and dryness. I dislike: Quite one-dimensional, soft and citrusy flavours (think orange) with gentle earthiness from the English hops. Juicy, yet with fair growing bitterness. Quite fresh, but not particularly inspiring, lacking any real fruity developments and avoiding the whole toasty range.
Barley's J. Scott Francis ESB;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barley's Brewing Company;on tap at the alehouse. Pours a amber color with a white head. Nice fruity hops and very drinkable.
Barley's J. Scott Francis ESB;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barley's Brewing Company;Cask, alehouse. Pours a deep amber color with a nice compact, cask-aled white head. Aroma is fruity, floral hops perfectly integrated with a nice deep maltiness underneath. Everything about this beer is nicely balanced, including the aroma. Taste is sweet yet bitter, fruity and hoppy though strongly malty. Very nice creamy mouthfeel. Drinkability is extremely high - I could drink this all night. The cask fits this beer extremely well. Great.

Es mag bei der Aromenvielfalt vielleicht nicht allzu komplex sein, aber das was da ist, ist sehr gut. Getreidigee Basis mit leicht hopfig-herben Noten.

Barley's Christmas Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Barley's Brewing Company;Pours clear amber with a two finger, white head. Aroma is spice, caramel and light roast. Taste is caramel and cinnamon, moving to roast and light hop backbone. Finish is cinnamon and light hops.
Barley's Christmas Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Barley's Brewing Company;Draft to taster in a flight at Barleys from notes. Pours a clear amber/copper color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have ginger, cinnamon, orange peel over a light caramel malt base, decent enough.
Barley's Christmas Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Barley's Brewing Company;"On tap, poured into a sampler glass. Spice aromas are noticeable off the pour, including cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove, with secondary notes of citrus and caramel. The oily, clear caramel-copper beer is topped by a medium, dense, white ring with surface wisps and leaves at light lace. The taste is a medium sweet and medium light bitter. The texture is syrupy with a fizzy carbonation and a medium, spicy body containing flavors of caramel, spicy orange with a spice and citrus crescendo at the finish. Very clean, spice aftertaste that�s light and short; very pleasant finish and aftertaste for a Christmas brew."
Barley's Christmas Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Barley's Brewing Company;4oz on tap at Barleys on Dublin. Clear golden orange color. Thin off-white head. Leaves ridge and spots of lace. Medium body. Smooth, kind of crisp lighter carbonation. Lightly slick. Spice, and some earthy piney spicy hop. Light to moderate bitter, light to moderate sweet. Not as sweet as your typical winter ale, not as dark, kind of hoppy, but mild overall. I guess that makes sense, since they�re calling it a golden ale. Interesting, using a golden ale as the base for a winter beer is pretty unique.
Barley's Christmas Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap at Barley�s Smokehouse. Light copper color with a very thin head that dissipates completely. Aromas of cinnamon, brown sugar and a hint of citrus. Flavors are bread and muted cinnamon, clove, honey and just a bit of citrus. Crisp mouthfeel. Good ale.

Barley's Christmas Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Barley's Brewing Company;Cinnamon and spice and everything nice about a Christmas ale, just a little past its prime
Barley's Christmas Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Barley's Brewing Company;Draught. Wow this is a spicy beer. Like taking a shot of nutmeg. It is good for the season but be ready to a flavor explosion.
Barley's Christmas Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Barley's Brewing Company;The beer pours an orangy copper color with a light white head, light carbonation. The aroma is light nutmeg, cinamin, pine and alcohol. The taste is light and delicate which is good because with the aromas this beer could be really overwhelming. The taste you get are a lots of tart pine and alcohol dominating with nutmeg mixed in there. The beer is too watery and not very drinkable. Overall a decent spiced winter beer.
Barley's Christmas Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap at the Smokehouse. Pours a clear amber with a minimal off-white head. Spicy aroma of cinnamon, clove and ginger. Lots of cinnamon flavor mixed with a bit of tartness, followed by the ginger and clove flavors. Medium finish.
Barley's Raspberry Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley's Brewing Company;Meh. Not much to it. A subtle raspberry flavor but it vanishes immediately into a kind of watery finish. Did I say meh?
Barley's Raspberry Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap at The Oak Room during Ohio Brew Week. Pours a hazy dark golden with reddish hue and a little head. Taste is wheat and a nice amount of raspberry. The raspberry meshes well with the wheat and barley. Good raspberry wheat beer.
Barley's Raspberry Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley's Brewing Company;Growler shared by wagenvolks. Thanks! Pours a honey color with almost no head. Smell is honey, wheat, raspberry, and a touch of alcohol. Taste is smooth, sweet wheat, honey, fruit and soft carbonation. Medium mouthfeel and smooth overall. Tasty.
Barley's Raspberry Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley's Brewing Company;Objectively speaking: Timid fruit beer with minimal yeast or wheat character. I like: Realatively well extracted, authentic fruitiness. I dislike: Limited aromas. Wheaty and fruity flavour profile, but certainly not tasty. Feels more like Raspberry special K, more or less generic cereals which lack any acidity depth. Some medicinal undertones do show up, but that�s most of the yeastiness that you�ll see in there. Dull.
Barley's Raspberry Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley's Brewing Company;Cloudy copper color with a small white head. Mild raspberry aroma. Flavor of raspberry and bready malts. Ok, raspberry is not too much.
Barley's Raspberry Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap at Barley�s Ale House.Light malt and raspberrys stand out in the aroma.Pours a cloudy orange with a light white head.Light malt and some light fruit makes up the flavor.Thin to medium mouthfeel with a light fruit finish.
Barley's Raspberry Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap ice cold at Barley�s Smokehouse. Nice golden pour with lots of carbonation and white bubbly head. Whiffs of raspberry were detectable. Flavor was crisp malt & hops. Raspberry was most noticable in the aftertaste. This was nice light fare that was good for washing down pulled pork.
Barley's Raspberry Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap at Barleys Ale House. Cloudy amber color with a tinge of pink. Aroma is of course raspberry and wheat...I was very surprised at the taste of this beer. For a fruit beer the raspberry was REALLY understated...Tasted it up front, and the rest of just some nice wheat and malt. Very nice fruit beer...
Barley's Raspberry Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley's Brewing Company;Ruddy apricot amber, hazy, with a ringing head. Very lightly sweet, lightly tart aroma. Very nice. Mild tartness, slight mustiness. Crisp, not clingy. Very, very slight vinegar. Floral raspberry finish.
Barley's Raspberry Wheat;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Barley's Brewing Company;Draft Ale House #2. Cloudy reddish amber color with a minimal fizzy off-white head that mostly diminished with fair lacing. Moderate raspberry wheat aroma. Light to medium body. Medium sweet raspberry flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Drinkable fruit beer.
Maes Nature;Alken, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken);Unusual in being a new, �modern� blonde table beer since 1999. On 75 cl bottles and cans. Cream white, sticky head, deep orange blonde colour, clear. Weak malt sweetness in the nose but the different other ingredients, i.e. oats, rye, lemon, orange and coriander are all noticeable, as well as abstract impressions of Brussels sprouts, cloves, tomato, pear and iron. Grainy taste, bit sourish, light spicy rye effect, lemonade-like ascorbic acid, light coriander, no hops worth mentioning and thin and watery finish with some citrus peel, bit metallic. Interesting concept, but artificial, I still prefer the more artisanal table beers. Not to be taken too seriously as it is literally marketed towards children.
Maes Nature;Alken, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken);head: none colour: clear yellow/orange smell: like pis , bad grain sent , nothing else taste: just as bad as smell brrrr i din�t finish this beer
Stoney Creek Stoney Pale Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stoney Creek Breweries;Poured a cloudy golden copper color with a modest white head. The nose was of fruity citric hops, with nice touches of vanilla, honey and pale malt. The taste echoes the aroma. It begins with a nice orange zest citric fruitiness. Then the malted grain appears midway through and adds a nice dimension of balance to the malts and hops. The finish is clean with pleasant floral hops lingering around. Light residual sugars add to the enjoyment. The amount of alcohol is more than appropriate to make it a good session ale. A damn fine beer.
Stoney Creek Stoney Pale Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stoney Creek Breweries;Had this beer on 4/9/07. Aroma is light with a sweet hop scent. Color is a hazy gold with very active carbonation and a nice big bubble head. Taste is crisp and hoppy. Starting with a medium body it goes down with a fizzy feel. Finish comes on with a bitterness biting at the sides of your tongue and a very light malt flavor. On the end is a bright hop flavor and a nice finishing bitterness. This is one nice hoppy brew.
Stoney Creek Stoney Pale Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stoney Creek Breweries;Bottle in Minnesota. A mild grassy and malt aroma with apple. Fairly well balanced. Rating from notes.
Stoney Creek Stoney Pale Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stoney Creek Breweries;Caramel malt-heavy bottom supporting a rich fresh tasting PNW hop bitterness with all of the pine and grapefruit notes that you would expect. Nicely brewed and sessionable drink.
Stoney Creek Stoney Pale Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stoney Creek Breweries;I will freely admit I got this one for ratings whoring purposes, and it frightens me. I am frightened because there is a whitish film on the bottom of the inside of the bottle. Being this isn�t exactly a bottle-conditioned Belgian ale, I have fear. Light copper. Smells of soap, weeds, some citrus, and stale bread. Flavor is sweet, some light fruit, a few hops, bit earthy. Thin and watery, is at least not actively horrid but isn�t particularly good.
Stoney Creek Stoney Pale Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stoney Creek Breweries;Pours copper and hazy with a creamy white head. Some floaties are present in the glass. Smells of grass, citrus, bread and surprisingly sharp for an APA. Taste is of lemons, pepper, floral, some grapefruit. Finish is sweet caramel with some peppery notes.
Stoney Creek Stoney Pale Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stoney Creek Breweries;Orange/Gold Coloring with Big White Head. Sediment - Rich Malt, Floral Hops Aroma. Dark Bread Taste and Dry Aftertaste. Heavy and Dark for a Pale.
Stoney Creek Stoney Pale Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stoney Creek Breweries;Has a pale orange slightly hazy body with a pure white frothy light head which is mostly diminishing. The nose is piney citrus, floral, and contains sweet mal. Has a slight hoppy bite with a soft, sweet malty backbone. I also detect a unique citrusy floral bouquet in the finish. Palate is not excessively watery and goes well with the overall balance of this beer.
Stoney Creek Stoney Pale Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stoney Creek Breweries;Gold color with a medium head. Dusty hop aroma. Very earthy tones in the flavor which I find unusual for a Pale Ale. The standard bitterness is the finish. Not bad at all.
Stoney Creek Stoney Pale Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stoney Creek Breweries;Started off great. Perhaps this is because I haven�t had the chance to drink anything but lagers for the past month (long trip to Japan). The head was nice. Aroma almost has a honey-like quality to it. Color and body are kind of weak. I could pound these back all night no problem. I am kind of surprised to see that it has 5.5% alcohol, though my body is saying quite the opposite. The alcohol taste is well hidden, so I think that it might earn a better overall score from me, compared to its individual ratings.
Stoney Creek Hefe Weisse;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stoney Creek Breweries;On tap: Lots of banana and a light citrus aroma. Cloudy orange with a white head. Lots of banana with a citrus, very light clove, and lightly acidic finish. Bubblegum flavor hides in the background. I found this rather good, but I think I�m in the minority.
Stoney Creek Hefe Weisse;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stoney Creek Breweries;Ashely's in Ann Arbor, post-fest - labelled as Stoney Creek Wheat. Muddy, creamy, banana, yes, but muted and NOTHING else, finally watery and, at the very warm end, sickly sweet.
Stoney Creek Hefe Weisse;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stoney Creek Breweries;Very hazy color, light with even some light peachy/orange tinges. Had a moderate white head. Smells like an estery hefe weizen. Initial taste is candy sweet with lots of clove. Some banana presence as well, though I would not agree that this beer is all banana. Flavor was a little bit too sweet and could have used some more lemon to balance it better, though it did dry out more towards the finish. The finish however, was bubbly and I seemed to always get alot of foam in my mouth and have to burp it out, which was interesting.
Stoney Creek Hefe Weisse;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stoney Creek Breweries;Great Hefe. Nice frothy head, cloudy golden color with a good banana overtones. I checked with the brewer's and this is not the same beer as the Atwater wheat beer.
Stoney Creek Hefe Weisse;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stoney Creek Breweries;First of all it looks similar to Bell''s Oberon, but much murkier. Now how much you like this depends on your love of bananas. Smells like bananas... tastes like bananas, Bananas, BANANAS.... turning into boiled ham, Boiled ham, BOILED HAM. The boiled ham flavor most likely was the high amount of yeat in suspension. I give this beer credit for being different and for making an interesting wheaty, which is normally not my fortay.
Stoney Creek Hefe Weisse;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stoney Creek Breweries;Among the Stoney Creek lineup this is certainly the best (I think they got their recipe from the previous brewery owners). Hazy yellow color reminiscent of a high school chemistry project that blew up our desk. Fantastic spiciness from phenol alcohol and little yeast beasties. A very thirst quenching German style wheat beer.
Stoney Creek Hefe Weisse;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stoney Creek Breweries;had this on tap in detroit. a nice beer. beautiful murky yellow color, extreme fruityness. nice finish.
Stoney Creek Hefe Weisse;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stoney Creek Breweries;My 400th rating is the best of the Stoney Creek offerings - which isn't saying much, but at least this one has some substance and a decent spicy wheat taste.
Stoney Creek Stoney Red Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Stoney Creek Breweries;"Not bad. Pours a slightly cloudy red. Not much in the aroma category; some malt. Palate and taste are decent. A little sweetness in there with a touch of spice. Finishes smooth."
Stoney Creek Stoney Red Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Stoney Creek Breweries;Subpar in virtually every catagory. Nose was pallid. Insipid caramel and toffee flavors...perhaps with some stale touches. No hoppiness to pull this one out of the dumper for me. Nothing horrible...but really really boring.
Stoney Creek Stoney Red Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Stoney Creek Breweries;Lightly hazed amber color with a smallish off white head. Dull malt aromas with a hint of floral hops. No objectionable just plain and boring. Light sweet caramel and mild malt flavors. Some light nut flavors. Just saw this was a irish ale, I would have never guessed. Another american amber I would have wagered. Still to me most ambers are just that, an amber.
Stoney Creek Stoney Red Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Stoney Creek Breweries;Bottle - nice sweet malt aroma mixed with spicy, noble hops. Beautiful amber body with a beige head - nice retention. Fairly hoppy at the start - again the spicy hops. I was really hoping that it would sweeten as I went, but it didn�t. That is pretty odd for an amber. Not great.
Stoney Creek Stoney Red Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Stoney Creek Breweries;Poured a clear amber, with small head. Nose was sour-sweet, malts. The taste was a bit burnt and caramel. LOts of malts to this one. OK, Thanks to Degarth
Stoney Creek Stoney Red Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Stoney Creek Breweries;Plesant beery aroma. Some caramel/malt sweetness, but some hops in there too. Reddish brown color with a pinky thick head. Strong malt profile. Tastes very German to me. Schwarzbierish in fact. One dimensional flavor palate, but nothing off putting about it.
Stoney Creek Stoney Red Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Stoney Creek Breweries;Aroma is sweet caramel malt and some yeast but not very hoppy. The Appearance is copper brown with lots of particulates. The flavor is both good and bad. It has some sweet caramel malt taste but also a paper taste. The hops are light. Palate is average and the aftertaste is like sweet carrots.
Stoney Creek Stoney Red Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Stoney Creek Breweries;Bottle--pour a medium head that dissipated quickly. The color was orange to amber, had some hoppy taste. Too carbonated for me.
Stoney Creek Stoney Red Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Stoney Creek Breweries;12 oz clear amber with a smallish head. Smells like a malty amber with sweet malts and some floral hoppiness. Taste has some mellow smokiness to it but thats quickly covered with some sweet barley flavors. Body is thin with a way too light carbonation.
Stoney Creek Stoney Red Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Stoney Creek Breweries;Bottle: Aroma of caramel and light hops. Pours a very dark transparent amber with an off-white head that quickly diminishes. Light initial caramel malty is quickly overtaken by a nutty and lightly hoppy finish. A little on the thin side.
Stoney Creek Light;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stoney Creek Breweries;here's the thing. this beer is not very good - not much taste at all in fact, but it IS, as they claim, exceptionally smooth, so it gets a few points for the texture, and it does have the only decent head of any Stoney beer. The sad thing might be that they put more care and quality into making this than in the other more complex brews.
Stoney Creek Double Chocolate Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Poured a dark opaque brown with a finger of bronze head that falls to cap the beer. The nose is of chocolate syrup, cocoa and a toasted nuttiness. The flavor is nice and chocolaty with with dark roasted malts coming through in the finish. The feel is pretty thin. I was hoping this would be as thick and creamy as the nose implied. The drinkabilty is moderate to high, but does seem to fall a little short of becoming a really good chocolate stout or porter.
Stoney Creek Double Chocolate Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;this was surprisingly good. great chocolate flavor with a slight hint of coffee, glad we got ahols of it while we could.
Stoney Creek Double Chocolate Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Distinct coffee, roasted malts, cocoa, and caramel flavors intermingle fairly seamlessly in this very accessable and easy drinking porter. A bit too sweet for my everyday beer, but a nice change of pace.
Stoney Creek Double Chocolate Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Bottle. Nice dark pour with small tan head. The aroma is almost all cocoa with very little else in the background. At this point I am worried that the chocolate is going to be way overbearing. On first sip, I am pleasantly surprised to taste roasted malts and coffee in addition to the chocolate. It has some sweetness that would not make me want to drink much of it, but I did enjoy what I had.
Stoney Creek Double Chocolate Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Pours a very dark reddish, brown with a light brown, almost tan head. Almost over the top chocolate taste and smell. Very rich. Would be a good after dinner brew, but nothing too special.
Stoney Creek Double Chocolate Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;"Deep red-brown body, medium light tan/cream head. Big chocolatey aroma with little else of note. Chocolatey, toasty body, rather bitter on the finish. Thin. I�m not sure what kind of competition this beer was up against for its victory in the ""chocolate beer"" category at the World Beer Cup, but there aren�t very many good ones out there, so that victory is not an especially difficult accomplishment."
Stoney Creek Double Chocolate Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Very black body. Just a barely perceptable ruby edge when held to the light. The aroma is cherries and chocolate. I can�t pull out much else for aroma. The taste is Cheerios and some light cocoa. There is not much else to get in the taste. One dimensional and a poor attempt at a chocolate beer.
Stoney Creek Double Chocolate Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;I expected more chocolate taste and aroma. Head did not last long, finish was good, slightly astringent.
Stoney Creek Double Chocolate Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;Pour is a dark brown with a tan head. Aroma is choco. Flavor is a very sweet chocolate almost to the point of being sickly sweet. I could be drinking chocolate milk and would have a hard time telling the difference. Try it if you have a sweet tooth.
Stoney Creek Double Chocolate Ale;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Porter;Stoney Creek Breweries;deep brown color, head is minimal, tan and lasting (what there is of it). aroma and flavor are of surprise surprise, cocoa, with moderate coffee notes. seems to have a more hoppy finish than most porters, but the style classification seems to be dead on. not a bad beer at all.
Niagara Falls Premium Lite;Brampton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Niagara Falls Brewing (Moosehead);(Draught) On tap at the Sam Jakes Inn in Merrickville, Ontario, as the Sam Jakes Light. Thin, white head and a light golden body. Nose of an under-ripe pear. Finishes clean. Below average.
Niagara Falls Premium Lite;Brampton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Niagara Falls Brewing (Moosehead);Terrible. I had this in the tasting room at the brewery. I was obviously gone, and it tasted like somebody forgot to clean the lines when changing the kegs because there were fake apple notes (similar to the apple ale) in the body. Dusty, apply aroma. Zero carbonation. Pissy yellow color, no head. Don't bother, unless you can get a decently quality controlled sample.

Flying Bison Blackbird Oatmeal Stout;Buffalo, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flying Bison Brewing;Bottle with more age on it than intended...pours black with a bountiful tan head - no carbonation worries at least. Aroma is quite inviting - sweet coffee, malt, a lactic note...not bad. Flavor is dull, however...light, sweet malt, hint of oatmeal, milk chocolate...flavors are good, just would like a bit more vibrancy here. Palate is well carbonated...seems appropriate for the style, albeit a little less oily than anticipated. Not half bad - would like to try fresh down the road
Flying Bison Blackbird Oatmeal Stout;Buffalo, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flying Bison Brewing;Weak aroma, pours a dark brown. Tastes of roast, coffee some hops and bitterness. Nice bite to it. Certainly nothing wrong with it, just not outstanding.

Flying Bison Blackbird Oatmeal Stout;Buffalo, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flying Bison Brewing;Growler fill from the brewery. Finally! Seems like forever I�ve been waiting for this to come back. Pours a mostly-opaque brown/black with a nice thick head that fades fairly quickly. Definitely smells of chocolate, and tastes of it as well. Very drinkable, I was able to put down the growler in one sitting and I�m not a huge drinker. This is even better than I remember it being in the past.
Flying Bison Blackbird Oatmeal Stout;Buffalo, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flying Bison Brewing;Appearance: Ribena/blackcurrant colour with a small white head. Aroma: Slight smoke and a hint of cream. Flavour: Nice, slightly malty, cream, oats and a long dry finish. Solid enough.

BruRm Winter Warmer Spiced Beer;New Haven, Connecticut, United States;Flavored - Other;BruRm @ BAR;Deep amber color, little head. Intense aroma of anise, allspice and vanilla. I could smell this for hours. A licorice amber if you will. Very nice meld of spices, but if you don't like licorice steer clear of this one. Notes of allspice in the finish. A tasty winter warmer.
Humpty Dumpty Swingbridge Ale;Reedham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Humpty Dumpty Brewery;This bottle was overcarbonated and tasted like sugar had been used as a primer in the bottle. The aroma was bland and the taste was dominated by nuttyness. Not a good advertisment for english microbrews.
Los Gatos Pilsner;Los Gatos, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Los Gatos Brewing Co.;Samples at Los Gatos Brewery. Golden hue with a lovely carbonation. Aroma noble hops and biscuit malt. Medium, tangy body. Floral, peppery hops fill the mouth with biscuit malt provide some balance. Long, earthy finish. Good, clean pils.
Los Gatos Pilsner;Los Gatos, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Los Gatos Brewing Co.;Draught at the brewpub. Clear gold with a lasting white head. Metallic, grainy, and spicy nose. The flavor is like a copper penny with some herbal bitterness and bread as well. Thin and prickly. They are getting the bitterness about right, but the malt is lacking and the metallic notes almost kill it.
Los Gatos Pilsner;Los Gatos, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Los Gatos Brewing Co.;On tap. Straw colored in the glass with little head or lacing. Slightly spicey at the beginning, with a heavy, hop grassy bitterness at the end. Nothing particularly remarkable about it.

Los Gatos Pilsner;Los Gatos, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Los Gatos Brewing Co.;This was actually a decent pils... or maybe I thought it was decent after trying everything else the brewpub had to offer. More body and malt than I was expecting, a pleasant plus. Other than that I have nothing to say.
Los Gatos Pilsner;Los Gatos, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Los Gatos Brewing Co.;I started not to rate this beer simply because I am not a pilsner person. I thought this beer tasted like, dare I say, Bud Light. Nice color, but not a favorite of mine. If you like a pilsner, you might like this better then me.
Los Gatos Pilsner;Los Gatos, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Los Gatos Brewing Co.;Initial palate reaction is one of disappointment as the rich golden color is at odds with the insipid taste. The bitter after taste only adds to the poor quality of this product. Budwesier or Miller would be viable alternatives to this beer.
Los Gatos Pilsner;Los Gatos, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Los Gatos Brewing Co.;Tap. A golden color (more so than I expected). A wheat yeasty aroma with a smooth crisp flavor.

Los Gatos Summertime Ale;Los Gatos, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Los Gatos Brewing Co.;Tasting Notes from Fall 2000: Tried it cask-conditioned. This mild ale seems to be using German or Bohemian hops, giving it more a feel of a Pilsner. Regardless, a fairly pleasant beer with good mouthfeel and a summer heat drinkability.
Los Gatos Exhibition Ale;Los Gatos, California, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Los Gatos Brewing Co.;Tasting Notes from Fall 2000: Uses Germanic hops. Decent malt and mild hops. I don't care how it was made, it doesn't taste like an ale to me.
Los Gatos Sherman Stout;Los Gatos, California, United States;Stout;Los Gatos Brewing Co.;Tasting Notes from Fall 2000: There's something in this beer that I've not had elsewhere: peanut butter! Mild smokiness. Tastes pretty good. Medium hops, goes down smooth.
Leavenworth Ingalls Extra Special Bitter;Olympia, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;Draft at the brewpub. This beer is most certainly not retired, as the keg they were tapped from this afternoon was most definitely not aged. Crystal clear dark amber with very little gray rim. Slightly floral, maybe berry-like nose. Medium body, lively carb. Biscuity, toasty mid-palate. Nice resiny finish.
Leavenworth Ingalls Extra Special Bitter;Olympia, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;On tap at the Sunnyside Mcmenamins as a guest tap. This esb was very smokey, really clashed against the hops and light fruity malts up front. Pours a darker copper with a fast falling off-white head. I�m just not a fan of the smoked flavor in this brew.
Leavenworth Ingalls Extra Special Bitter;Olympia, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;Red with a solid white head. Very smooth and creamy until a woody charred flavor emerges, cherries and burnt wood in the finish. Quite good.

Leavenworth Ingalls Extra Special Bitter;Olympia, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;Perfect amber pint with the perfect head as well. Typical ESB bittermess and a boilerplate version of the style, but inferior to other Pacific NW ESB's, such as Redhook.
Days Golden;Marrero, Louisiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Day Brewing;Golden in color with a small white head. aroma is of sweet malt citrus and butter. Sweet butterscotch flavor.
Days Golden;Marrero, Louisiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Day Brewing;Straight from Louisiana via BigLove, this beer poured pale golden and fizzy, but the head wouldn�t hold at all. The smell was bready and on sweetish. The taste was oddly sour and doughy with almost no hop bitterness. The body was medium thick and aftertaste sharp and mineralized. Not a best representation of the style.
Days Golden;Marrero, Louisiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Day Brewing;Cloudy yellow, sweet aroma, sour as all hell, most likely off, I�ll try it again the next time I�m in New Orleans.
Days Golden;Marrero, Louisiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Day Brewing;Average beer. Golden in color, eggshell head. Full bodied, apples and berry, mildly hoppy finish. had its moments, but very average.
Days Golden;Marrero, Louisiana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Day Brewing;"Is Tallahassee the only place that sells this stuff? Indescrible aroma - resembled olive oil. Thick mouthfeel to it - very unique tasting beer - kind of ""buttery"" if I had to pin a flavor to it."

Clipper City Reserve Winter Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - English;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;"This beer rocks! Crystal clear, copper ale with a small, creamy, white head. Decent retention; good lacing. The nose is of caramel, toffee and Winter spices. The flavor starts off sweet, but is balanced nicely by a generous hop addition. Notes of toffee and buttermilk. Also, something leathery. Medium-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Short, clean, dry finish. World class Winter warmer!"
Clipper City Reserve Winter Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - English;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;CLear amber body with a smallish white head.

Clipper City Reserve Winter Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - English;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;"2002 Batch: Brilliant copper colour with ruby highlights when held up to a light and a perfect head--2 centimetres tall, VERY small bubbles and a great tan colour, leaving a great lacing on the glass. Smells of hops, sweet spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, anise), caramel and a healthy dose of malt. Full-bodied; Strong flavour consisting of alcohol, malt, hops and a fair amount of the spices detected in the nose. Aftertaste consists of bittering malt, decently strong hops and a taste of the alcohol. A pretty good beer for the style, but not perfect. The flavour in the taste and aftertaste is sub-par, but the appearance and aroma are spot-on! If you are looking for a good beer to try in the autumn/winter, and live in the Mid-Atlantic Region, definately pick this one up! I bought this 12 ounce beer at Total Wine in Chantilly, Virginia and sampled it on 3-September-2003."

Crescent City Carnival Lager;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crescent City Brewery;The first beer I had when I arrived in New Orleans had to be a Carnival of course! I marked this down as my first place to go when i got to the big easy. This beer is actually pretty good. Only brewed in the Carnival season, it�s a moderately hopped light tan color slightly foamy beer.
Crescent City Carnival Lager;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Crescent City Brewery;Slightly less palatable than their dunkel, but has a more hop presence and a better balance to its character. However, it still felt too light in body to be a true lager.

Heavy Seas Gold Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;On tap at Heavy Seas Alehouse (Arlington, VA). Blond body with a thin, white foamy head. Decent malty/hoppy aroma with grainy, sweet, and bready hints. Its thin malty taste carries herbal notes. Ends with a short bittersweet finish. Ordinary.
Heavy Seas Gold Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;My bottle indicates this is a golden ale brewed with wheat, although the description for this beer on ratebeer makes no mention of wheat - anyhow, this poured a clear golden color with a distinct aroma of wheat and citrus, surprisingly wheaty for not being a full-on wheat ale. Flavor is a light citrus hoppiness with a whear sweetness that is less sugary than comparable golden wheat ales. Light bodied and clean finishing on the palate. Overall this sessionable summer ale strikes me as far preferable to Samuel Adam's summer ale, as it has no added spices yet presents a similar flavor profile with more subtlety. This is my personal favorite brew I've tried so far from Heavy Seas and I definitely would pick up a six pack of this for a summer party. A simple but well-executed beer.
Heavy Seas Gold Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Draft. An unmemorabel yet pleasant golden ale. Light herb and spice notes, clean and easy to drink.

Golden, light and clear with a full white crown. Subdued nose and flavours, mild hoppiness over a mini malt base.

Humpty Dumpty Golden Gorse;Reedham, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Humpty Dumpty Brewery;On cask at the Wellington A decent golden ale is mostly on the mark. A slightly above average example of the style is worth checking out if you see it on cask in the Birmingham area. I would probably give it another look after exhausting most of the new selections. Aroma / Appearance - The semitransparent golden base is soft and gentle. Lemon slices spread over white bread with a bite of mild hops create a coherent and light profile. Flavor / Palate - Lemons and a blast of grapefruit hit the palate with the sweet taste of a glass of lemonade. Orange polish appears in the finish. In the transition between the two is a mild peppery texture. This is a decent all around beer that surpasses most of the run of the mill golden ales on cask.
Humpty Dumpty Golden Gorse;Reedham, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Humpty Dumpty Brewery;50cl bottle thanks to Nustu. Pours a hazy golden with a nice head. The nose has pine and a hint of custard. The taste has a nice green note, so limes but primarily a flowerpot taste. The palate has a light to medium bodied and textured with a nice clean finish. Overall, a well balanced ale.

Clear pale straw in colour with a thin white head. Slight floral hop resin note in the short aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing.

Rock Bottom Minneapolis Bezerk Malt Liquor;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Malt Liquor;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Pours a clear yellow gold, fairly sparkly, with about a quarter inch of acid white head. The head dies back in short order, but it still leaves a respectable lacing. Sweet malt and Karo syrup in the aroma. Not necessarily my cup o� tea, but great for the style. Sweet, malty, and um... corny? It has that certain �malt liquor� flavor to it, but its not sicky sweet or artificial or grapey or thick & cloying or anything like that. How do I put this? It tastes like a malt liquor would if a malt liquor wasn�t the dregs of beerdom. Or something like that. I get a slight tang of hop bitterness in the finish. Very smooth, fuller body than expected, and nice fizzy carbonation. Deceptively potent, and even tasty if you are open minded about the style. I�m not sure that I�m open minded about the style.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Bezerk Malt Liquor;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Malt Liquor;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;"from a growler, poured into a Belgian-styled snifter goblet. Clear, pale golden colr, noce, sturdy, snow white head. Aroma: typical lager nose, nothing but, nothing more, nothing less, sweet, yeah, almost corn-y, but not so bad...I almost like it. bright and vegetal, but not horrid, as I�d expected...aniticipated? Taste: bare, transparent, and as hollow as the typical lager gets, a great field of nada, but in this case, buttressed by a handy helping of booze. Big vegetal feel, but nothing awful, nothing coarse, nothing palate-searing...this is surprisingly easy to drink! The booze pipes in rather easily, though, in the middle of my glass...oh, yeah, they got this pegged! Why not serve in a brown paper bag, just go all the way, eh? Will I go berserk with this ""malt likka"" in me? Eh...probably not, not my style...but if I did a ton in one sitting, who know what havoc I�d let loose. This certainly does recreate the basic aspects of the style, as it is, but is still somehow drinkable and likable. Must stand in as the second craft brew malt liquor I�ve yet to sample, and must be the better of the two ( I think). PS...really gave me the hiccups!"

Rock Bottom Minneapolis Cranberry Milk Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Pours a healthy black - you could almost call it a very deep purple, topped by an inch or so of fluffy white foam. Pretty good head retention and spotty lacing. Tart and tangy aroma - with fruit tart cherry and fig more so than cranberry - along with a bit of roasted malt. Fruit comes through in the flavor, with cranberry being the leading, but not the only fruit flavor. I also detect blackberry, gooseberry, and fig. Actually, the fruitdominates the flavor, but the texture is a creamy milk stout. Tart, not-quite-acidic cranberry lingers in the aftertaste. Perfect carbonation.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Cranberry Milk Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;St. Paul Winterfest 2004. Can�t really smell it.

Empire Schwarzbier;Syracuse, New York, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Empire Brewing Company;Black/Grey/Brown color, somewhat hard to define.

I had no idea this was an IPA but the rating suits an aged IPA well. Fleeting white head over an amber body. Malty fruit aroma. There is some sweetness underneath, but overall this is a solidly bitter beer.
Rogue Jubilee Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA;Rogue Ales;A nice amber beer with a strong hop aroma. A taste of sweet malt and mild hops. A good holding bitter finsish. Not a great beer but well above average.
Rogue Jubilee Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA;Rogue Ales;Bottle shared by kp: Transparent, lightly hazy copper pour has a thick, light tan head. Mild citrusy hops and earthy caramel malty presence in the aroma. Body starts with earthy caramel malt flavor balanced with a nice, dry earthy bitterness toward the finish. Seems to have aged very well. A nice, still hoppy brew.
Rogue Jubilee Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA;Rogue Ales;I did not know i had a retired beer, that be cool. My notes are sloppier than those of shag. I get a burnt rust color, its like a glass full of the UT horns. I found this beer have more caramel tones than anything else. It was better than decent.
Rogue Jubilee Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA;Rogue Ales;Ok now the notes are getting sloppy, but not as bad as some Ive written. A dark orange appearance with a moderate head. The flavor is hoppy with some dark fruits present. A very malty take on the style. A very good and well balanced beer.
Rogue Jubilee Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA;Rogue Ales;Some nice citrus, carmel, malt, and hoppy flavors in this one. maybe a touch of molasses as well. smoother than i expected from the aroma.
Empire Porter;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter;Empire Brewing Company;From 2002: Pretty basic porter, dark deep brown. Chocoalte, roasted malt, coffee, and some hops. Chewy, yet easy to drink. Not very complex like advertised.
Empire Porter;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter;Empire Brewing Company;"Sampled at the Syracuse location. Black; milk chocolate & cocoa aroma; thick malt flavours - chewy and sweet. Some could really get into this, but after drinking Smutty Robust all last winter this seems simple in comparison."
Empire Porter;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter;Empire Brewing Company;Dark brown. Light roasty nose. Sweet body, some smokey malt. Very light example.
Empire Porter;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter;Empire Brewing Company;Head diminished rater quick that vanished after few minutes. Very one dimensional product, light coffee, bland.
Empire Porter;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter;Empire Brewing Company;I really enjoy this porter. Another one of my favorites. Not the strongest out there, but not the weakest. No confusing/muddled notes, just a straight up porter, chocolatey, roasty with a slightly increased amount of hops to add some extra ale appeal. Great burnt white head and brownish-coffee appearance.
Empire Porter;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter;Empire Brewing Company;Very good tasting but very under-malted for a porter. I could tell as soon as it was poured that it did not have enough of a backbone because it's head was so thin and bubbly, not frothy like a strong porter should be. Not very impressed by this brewery so far.
Brick House Tricentenial IPA;Patchogue, New York, United States;IPA;Brick House Brewery & Restaurant;Hazy light amber/yellow. Thin head. Light carbonation. Not much aroma. Light citrusy hop bite. Pale malts. Another yawner.

Samuel Adams Weiss Bier;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boston Beer Company;Decent for an American weisse. Pours golden. Nose and taste of spices, wheats, light sweetened malts. Rated 6/17/02
Samuel Adams Weiss Bier;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boston Beer Company;From bottle. Cloudy orange with a thin white head. Refreshing beer. Bitter with herb and coriander.
Samuel Adams Weiss Bier;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boston Beer Company;This was a decent take on the style. Some nice yeasty qualities throughout, banana and clove, a light bit of bubblegum connect to a really light honey sweet malt body.
Samuel Adams Weiss Bier;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boston Beer Company;Blonde color with a white head. This beer has a wonderfully sweet malty flavor accented by banana and spice. I wish I could find more of this.
Samuel Adams Weiss Bier;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boston Beer Company;On draft @ the brewery with the Mad_Indian, thanks Andy our tour guide for really hooking us up. Pours hazy yellow with an avaerage size white head. Aroma of banana, cloves, and spices. The flavor is sweet, banana, and spices. Good brew.
Samuel Adams Weiss Bier;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boston Beer Company;Sampled with Stegosaurus during our second Boston Tour. Served at Sam Adams. Thanks to Andy for letting us stick around to rate this. Cloudy yellow pour with good head retention. Banna and wheat aroma. Good blend of Bannana and alcohol. It was quite enjoyable.
Samuel Adams Weiss Bier;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boston Beer Company;very nice American �cheif� beer... Sam Adams has become the very best of all mass-production American beer companies... KUDOS!
Samuel Adams Weiss Bier;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boston Beer Company;Again, Sam Adams is not my favorite brewer, but it is growing on me. I really liked this beer because of its complexity, and the fact that it didnt really taste like any beer I�ve had before. It had a certain sweet flavor, almost like cotton candy, that I thought was really good. Had mild fruity notes, was smooth and refreshing. After taste was mildly bitter, again with that distinct sweet flavor. Not bad.
Samuel Adams Weiss Bier;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boston Beer Company;I have no idea how to rate this aroma, this is not very hefe like, but all the same,it is like a hefe on steroids, loads of clove, yeast and fruit, maybe banana v apples? not a clear banana nor citrus feel. Those american hops and malt are quite obvious. Its quite like that american breweries cant copy the original, they always overdue it with too much malt and hops, and american malt and hops. I�m not saying this is bad, it is rather interesting but it fails to capture the orginal idea. This is still a hefeweizen in every sence of it, really really refreshing and quite nice. As a hefe, there something off, but not in a bad way. Really interesting and a good brew
Samuel Adams Weiss Bier;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boston Beer Company;Interesting, not sure what to make of this one. It has a big malty nose and some overly corny aromas as well. The flavour is not what I would typically expect from a hefeweizen, there isn�t as much citrus and light flavours happening. It�s too smoky in my opinion, with far too much darker malt coming through. Maybe my bottle is bad, but I�m not getting the banana that I would normaly expect. It is easy to drink, but isn�t that enticing.
Brakspear Vintage Ale 1999;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Porter;Brakspear (Marston's);Have you been really growing there and make you been on my way through their lives to get someone with an eye for me lol how long the other hand in the history channel to be able
Brakspear Vintage Ale 1999;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Porter;Brakspear (Marston's);Bottle, bought @ YNWA, Kolding. [vintage 1999] Pours deep dark red amber with a small, creamy, off-white head. Heavy aroma of dried fruits, light oxidation, raisins, a hint of honey and chocolate. Some port. Medium carbonation, fine lightly oily mouthfeel. Flavour has some honey, mildly roasted, a hint of oxidation. Long, lingering, port-wine aftertaste. Quite impressive for an 11-year old beer at only 5,5 %. Fair dryness, some raisins. Actually quite fine.
Brakspear Vintage Ale 1999;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Porter;Brakspear (Marston's);[1999 Bottle, thanks argo0!] Pours light cola-brown with a small off-white head. Aroma has some port-like qualities, honey, brown sugar, raisin--very nice. Taste is chocolate, roasted malt, plum, and a good deal of alcohol. Medium mouthfeel with a decent finish. The aroma on this is great, and if the alcohol wasn�t so present the taste would have been up there too. Thanks again for breaking this one out, argo0!
Brakspear Vintage Ale 1999;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Porter;Brakspear (Marston's);Tawny brown. A little nutty, with a touch of diacetyl. A hit of astringency leads to dry, woody notes. Not bad for a beer that is supposed to be off.
Brakspear Vintage Ale 1999;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Porter;Brakspear (Marston's);A bit thin, but still brings forth some wonderful creamy chocolate flavor. Chalky dry finish and nice aftertaste of roasty malts and almonds.
Brakspear Vintage Ale 1999;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Porter;Brakspear (Marston's);Brown-amber w/ toffee foam. Milk chocolate, toffee, & nuts on the nose. Smooth medium body. Chocolate mocha flavour w/ roasty, nutty notes.
Brakspear Vintage Ale 1999;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Porter;Brakspear (Marston's);"RBSG2003 Ridiculously clear, deep, dark copper brew. Not much head... I like a little head ;) The aroma is of milk chocolate and English toffee. The flavor is well-balanced, malty and rich with a touch of caramel. Medium-bodied with a silky mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Short, bitter finish. Very nice vintage ale that pulls up just short of being world-class in my book."
Brakspear Vintage Ale 1999;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Porter;Brakspear (Marston's);Milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, and a dark breadiness in the aroma, along with a faint mustiness. Dark, opaque brown in color, with a creamy, rocky head. More chocolate to be found in the flavor profile, along with a measure of sweetness, toffee, and grainy and bready malt. Very smooth, creamy texture with low effervescence which brings it very close to cask-conditioned in feel.
Brakspear Vintage Ale 1999;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Porter;Brakspear (Marston's);Thanks Hopsrus (I hope I'm right) for bring this beer to Chi-town. Reddish brown hue with average head and good lacing. Roasted malts, caramel, dark chocolate, vanilla, leather, and pear detected on the nose. Slighty tart and bitter taste, but not overpowering. Finished pretty clean of the style. A bit watery mouthfeel. Glad to have tried it.
Brakspear Vintage Ale 1999;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Porter;Brakspear (Marston's);Malt, treacle, tobacco aromas. Copper colour, poured a medium toffee head, lot's of floaties. Robust malt, toffee, caramel and butterscotch, bitter chocolate and vanilla. Complex, bitter but good! Superb!

Samuel Adams Utopias;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boston Beer Company;From backlog. Sample from a mug @ EBF 2019. Malty, sticky and syrupy with loads of booze, toffee and caramel notes. Heavy with barrel and oak notes. Feels more like a liquor than a beer.
Samuel Adams Utopias;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boston Beer Company;"8000th review! 8 ounce pour from a 24 ounce bottle; 2017 vintage bottling. Bottle #14819. Pours still, slightly hazy ruby reddish/orange/copper color. No head or lacing, but tons of alcohol legs on the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Increasing booze in the aromas, but not too overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Taste of huge raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light oak char bitterness, and barrel tannin/alcohol spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark fruits, cherry, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, brown bread/crust, licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel flavors; with a great malt/oak spiciness balance, and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering barrel tannin and spicy alcohol. Fairly full body; with a smooth, creamy/slick, and lightly syrupy/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Light-moderate increasing warmth of 28%, some lingering barrel booze after the finish; but not overwhelming. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged strong ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the enormous ABV. As expected this is like a cross between beer and all above mentioned spirits. Mind blowing amounts of complexity; and everything is perfectly integrated with all the different barrels. A highly amazing offering, and world class beer for what it was. A truly unique experience."
Samuel Adams Utopias;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boston Beer Company;Sampled at Big Beers, Belgians & Barleywines Festival. Hazy amber colored appearance with minimal head. Aroma of sweet caramel, brandy, toasted oak, red wine, mild toffee and light sugary notes. Similar flavor, rich, boozy and strong with moderate sweetness, a full body, minimal carbonation and a warming finish. Wow.
Samuel Adams Utopias;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boston Beer Company;2012 edition, to brandy snifter. Pours dark burgundy, damn near black with zero head. Strong aromas of molasses, dark chocolate, dark fruits and alcohol. Sweetish flavor. So many flavors present. Strong port barrel undertone. Some maple is present. Some molasses like bitterness. As full bodied as can be with an oily slickness coating the tongue. Very unique experience.

Hop House Ale;Glenorchy, Australia;Mead;Hop House;sad, limp, watery, flavourless but nice bottle. ............................
Hop House Ale;Glenorchy, Australia;Mead;Hop House;"The only reason this doesn't get 0.5 is to make my graph look better. One of the most revolting beers I've had the misfortune to taste. Allegedly a traditional ""mead ale"", but tastes like made-from-can homebrew with crappy honey stirred into it. Zero head, and a stink of dogshit. seeing as i bought this from a hophouse you might think they would at least put a bit of bitterness in it - nope. the joke's on me for paying $4.50 for this tourist trap shit."
Triple Rock Punched In The IPA;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse;Draft. Golden amber with a quickly dissapating whitish head. Lower than expected grapefruit aroma. Citrus, resiny, floral bitterness with caramel backing. Good bitterness, but the flavor is lacking a bit - all resin without anything else at that level to give it a boost. Almost a skunk like background quality.
Triple Rock Punched In The IPA;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse;Almost wet hop nose. Good malt heavy on the pale malt. Big well conditioned mouthfeel. Full and round with big bitterness great hop resin and oily sticky hop palate. Very oily looking good head retention Huge dry hop aromaColumbus and chinook flavors very piney and resinous finish.
Triple Rock Punched In The IPA;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse;Bushy, green full aroma. Cloudy burnt light orange color. Some malt sweetness apparent to the nose. A thick sustained head. Big hops on the front but light on the back with some creaminess in the middle. I like a starker center in my IPAs. I was told this one got softer after tapping. Still very good.
Hoppy Hoppy Claus Holiday Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Hoppy Brewing Company;22oz bottle. Poured an amber color with a small sized off white head. Some spiciness, citrus, and toasted bread.
Hoppy Hoppy Claus Holiday Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Hoppy Brewing Company;Clove-like nose with some fruitiness. Spicy flavor with some malty sweetness. Alas, a burnt toffee bitterness and a harsh bitter aftertaste spoils this beer for me.
Hoppy Hoppy Claus Holiday Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Hoppy Brewing Company;Shared with Strykzone on Facebook Chat. Poured a rich amber color with a beige head and good lacing. Nose is spicy with nutmeg and cinnamon. Medium plus body. Flavor is very much a blast of spices. and I get allspice to go along with the nutmeg and cinnamon. Maybe ginger. Finishes rich and flavorful with lovely spices. Great holiday beer.
Hoppy Hoppy Claus Holiday Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Hoppy Brewing Company;22 oz bottle from hayduke that we had together via facebook chat. Hazy golden brown with a nice off white creamy head. Falls very unevenly. Cool looking. This begins with big nutmeg and pumpkin but soon huge fruit emerges. That fruit is not really citrus, not tropical, not stone, etc. Not sure what it was. Whatever, it was good. Lets call this a humulus holiday beer. I liked everything about it. And all of that fruit was the icing on the, well, humulus. Not usually a fan of holiday beers but this one stood out.
Hoppy Hoppy Claus Holiday Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Hoppy Brewing Company;22 oz bottle. (Texas Wine & Spirits) Carlsbad, CA. Dark cloudy amber colour with a small off-white head. Spices... nutmeg, cinnamon and some other christmassy spices and some sweet maltiness in the aroma. A bit harsh bitterness, sweet maltiness and a lot of spices. I really don�t know how old is this bottle but it seems to be very christmassy and drinkable. Merry Christmas!
Hoppy Hoppy Claus Holiday Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Hoppy Brewing Company;"""ok, i see that this got some decent reviews, and i can honestly say i don�t know what any of you are thinking. Dec 07 i had a holiday beer taste-off with over 2 dozen beers (about 20 people)...nobody liked this beer (what the hell is in there anyway)...and i think 19 of the 20 said we should dump it, so we did. needless to say it finished in a very distant last place. no redeeming qualities. maybe we got a bad one, but it didn�t taste spoiled... 2010-better than b4, still notworth buying."""
Hoppy Hoppy Claus Holiday Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Hoppy Brewing Company;Pour is a hazy red with a small white head. Aroma is all spice. Nutmeg and cinnamon. Flavor is kind of a syrupy malt with some of the spice. Finish leaves some candied apple like malt with some butterscotch on the tongue. This was a bargain bin pickup at about a quarter of the regular price so it was probably well past its prime as the spices were kinda lost. But fresh I could see this as a overly spiced winter ale.
Hoppy Hoppy Claus Holiday Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Hoppy Brewing Company;Cloudy deep amber color. Smells like a fruit cake. It has a smooth spiced flavor and leaves a light coating of it behind.
Hoppy Hoppy Claus Holiday Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Hoppy Brewing Company;Orange/red with a finger-wide white head. Aroma of grapefruit, apple juice, nutmeg., and cinnamon. Flavor is sharp on the spices at first, but transitions into a hoppy fruit finish. Spice lingers in the aftertaste.
Hoppy Hoppy Claus Holiday Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Hoppy Brewing Company;Bottle. Obviously, not in the holiday spirit anymore, but this doesn�t come across quite right. The pumpkin pie kinda thing dominates this, but it�s not pumpkiny, just some mulled spice thing, which unfortunately finishes with a off-putting mash IMHO. (#5458, 3/13/2014)
Invercargill WASP Golden Ale;Invercargill, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Invercargill Brewery;"This is one from the old beer diary; it�s no longer available. Pretty decent fruity beer, a little sweet for my taste, but overall a good effort. Haven�t tasted their follow up for this one. Very nice label."
Invercargill WASP Golden Ale;Invercargill, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Invercargill Brewery;Another one from the archives of my old tasting notes: Fora ll intents and purposes this is a good standard summer wheat beer. The banana and clove aromas and flavours make this very easy to sell, let alone drink and enjoy. A touch of bubblegum perhaps? A tasty wee brew to have before getting onto something much more serious.
Invercargill WASP Golden Ale;Invercargill, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Invercargill Brewery;Bottle, likely among the last in existence. I was speaking with one of the brewery staff and this is no longer being made. In fact, when I told them where I had this (Tuatara Backpackers), they said that they were going to go over and trade the rest of the Golden Ales for the new Honey Pilsner, because the Golden Ale is now past its date. True, as my bottle has a BBD of April 2009. Anyway, this poured a dark golden with a medium white head. Sweet grainy aroma, pretty plain really. Flavours of wheaty sweet grains, with a hint of spiciness and marzipan. I�m not mourning this beer�s retirement, particularly given that the honey pilsner is soooo much better!
Invercargill WASP Golden Ale;Invercargill, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Invercargill Brewery;Pale yellow with a small white head. Aroma is of wheat and biscuit dough. Taste is of powdered malt.
Invercargill WASP Golden Ale;Invercargill, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Invercargill Brewery;(Bottle, courtesy of Swalden_28) Pours a clear pale yellow body with a small white head. Aroma of honey, biscuit, grass, and grain. Flavor of sweet malt, bread dough, and light honey with a dry finish.
Invercargill WASP Golden Ale;Invercargill, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Invercargill Brewery;Bottle..2 years old....Pours a light straw yellow with fizzy white head. Aroma was fruity....Flavor was unique to me...Nice citris notes that blended very well with slight honey notes. Palate was light with high carbonation. This really was a nice refreshing beer......
Invercargill WASP Golden Ale;Invercargill, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Invercargill Brewery;Pours a clear yellow with a small white diminishing head. Smells of honey and alcohol. Sweet with a light bitterness. Malty aromas of cookies. Hoppy aromas of grass. Lots of Belgian yeast and a bit of dough. Also hints of apple and honey and a tiny hint of alcohol. Medium bodied with a lightly creamy mouthfeel. Soft carbonation. Dry finish.
Invercargill WASP Golden Ale;Invercargill, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Invercargill Brewery;Bottle, a slight haze to the pale gold, with no head. Aroma is fruity, yeasty and wheaty. Again, fruity, yeasty and wheaty on the palate. Solid. Belgium-like.
Invercargill WASP Golden Ale;Invercargill, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Invercargill Brewery;(Bottle 33 cl) Pours a slightly hazy, pale golden with a small, white head. Lightly sweet aroma of honey and yeast. Medium body with lightly fruity notes, a little honey, a little yeast and a short, dry finish. A rather refreshing, light summer beer. 260108
Invercargill WASP Golden Ale;Invercargill, New Zealand;Wheat Ale;Invercargill Brewery;I�ve had this one in New Zealand on my honeymoon. Visited the brewery too. Nice wheat. Honeylike indeed. A bit fruity, banan, citric but not too much. Nice one.
Labatt Toreador;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pale color, thin body, hot alcohol flavour. Basically a beer designed to get you drunk for cheap. I think it was only available in a 40oz (1.18L) until it was discontinued.
Wineglass Bay Hazards Ale;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wineglass Bay Brewing;Hazy and effervescent, with a big head. Aroma is quite yeasty. Taste is the same, with a wheaty tartness, hit of yeast. Hazardous, though that�s mostly because it�s wild and a bit unreliable.
Wineglass Bay Hazards Ale;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wineglass Bay Brewing;Excellent beer, that accompanies a nice medium rare steak well. Highly recommended
Wineglass Bay Hazards Ale;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wineglass Bay Brewing;Tastes and smells like a brewery in a good way, refreshing and easy drinking brew. Worth a try.
Wineglass Bay Hazards Ale;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wineglass Bay Brewing;Bottle. Amber with a white head that fades to a coat. Aroma of toffee flowers pepper some fig. Lowish carbonation, fairly light bodied. Sweet toffee a little bread, balancing bitterness some spices. A bit alt-ish. OK.
Wineglass Bay Hazards Ale;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wineglass Bay Brewing;Draught at The Royal Oak, Launceston. Sampled on August 6, 2013. Clear deep golden to copper color, dense teal head. Malty, creamy, fruity taste. Smooth mouthfeel, medium bitterness. Fruity, malty aftertaste. Malty, sweet, fruity scent.
Wineglass Bay Hazards Ale;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wineglass Bay Brewing;330ml bottle. A big crackly crisp sand coloured foam sits atop a base of dark amber to mild copper liquid. Caramel malt aromas are pleasant in the nose. Full bodied and flavoured with a malty backdrop that is very tasty. Overall a very good brew, a nice and unexpected surprise
Wineglass Bay Hazards Ale;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wineglass Bay Brewing;"didnt mind this one. in a bottle at the Australian Hotel in Sydney, one of the last beers i had (which could explain why i didnt mind it, after reading some of the reviews i had to wonder). was a bit too much like an american ""fill-er-with-sugar"" taste, but finished smooth."
Wineglass Bay Hazards Ale;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wineglass Bay Brewing;Bottle (330ml). Poured muddy brown with an averaged sized, loose, rocky, off-white head which diminished almost immediately. A dusty aroma with sweet malts, brown sugar, odd cola-like notes, stale bread and some cobwebs to top off the mess of an aroma. Flavor was a light bitterness with notes of mineral water, sweet biscuity malts, caramel and subtle fruitiness (cranberries). Foamed excessively in the mouth - similar to putting a berocca tablet on your tongue. Light bodied with fizzy carbonation (far to over carbonated, more so than a soft drink), a watery texture and a short finish.
Wineglass Bay Hazards Ale;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wineglass Bay Brewing;Brought over with a friend of mine, been stored for some time. A refrshing beer with some wheaty tones. A medium bodied beer, with a short finish
Wineglass Bay Hazards Ale;Bicheno, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Wineglass Bay Brewing;Cloudy orange in colour with a thin frothy and rapidly disapating white head. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Moderate bitterness and a long-lasting crisp bitter finish. Refreshing.
City LaCrosse Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Aroma is corn/malts and mild fruit. The flavor is fruit/berries, corn/malts and a mildly sweet finish.
City LaCrosse Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);12oz can (old notes �03)-Pours a lighter golden with a white head. Aroma of of corn and sweetness. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew is not as good as the regualr lager.
City LaCrosse Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);I liked this beer less than thee non light version, comes pre-skunked in the can. Took 2 sips and poured the rest in a kettle with some brats onions, garlic, and apples. 45 min later in had done more for my brats than it ever could have offered my tongue.
City LaCrosse Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Poured a mid-gold/yellow with a decent head that faded to lace. Aroma was slightly sweet and of malt and corn. Taste started off with sweet hint of malt and then a slight sour taste into adjuncts and a light hop finish. Palate was a bit thin and carbonation was high. Overall, a mediocre light. I was a bit disappointed as I thought this would be closer to regular LaCrosse City Lager which is pretty decent for the price. The sour notes took away from this.
City LaCrosse Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Just the light version of the lager by the same name. The best quality of it is that I got my father in-law hooked on it over miller lite and I am now saving on average about $14 every time he comes over to visit.That is a savings of $28 dollar a month!
City LaCrosse Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);From the can. This was not tasty, not decent and not good. No bitterness, wasn�t very clean tasting and it was fizzy. I don�t understand why these watered down beers exist, especially when they�re offensive. Meh.
City LaCrosse Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Decent cheap light beer. Nothing great about it but its far from a terrible beer. Plus it�s like 6.50 for fifteen o these
City LaCrosse Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Picked up a single 12-oz bottle at Festival Foods in LaCrosse, Wisconsin. Pours a clear, light straw blonde brew with a fast dissolving white head that dissipates clean with a thin ring. Aroma of light multi-grain malt, grassy hops and a touch of vegetables. Taste is very light bodied, well-carbonated with hardly no flavor except a thin malt and grassy hop taste. Finish is clean cut, crisp and no bitterness. Just your average run of the mill light, watered down beer.
City LaCrosse Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Ive got a dirty thirty of this and i have no idea why. Oh well here goes the first of 30. kinda tastes like water with a hint of bud light. Its not skunked or horrible tasting though.
City LaCrosse Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);elch... where to begin. A somewhat standard pale lager aroma. Fizzy and yellow with a thin head. The taste is overwhelmingly sour and unpleasant. Corn malt at its worst. I got this one for only 50 cents at the dollar store, so I guess I can�t really complain. You get what you pay for.
Moab Brewery Scorpion Pale Ale;Moab, Utah, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moab Brewery;Draft at the bayou. Pours light brown with almost no head. Not much on the nose. A bit of caramel on the tongue. Finishes dry. Obviously I was hoping for more hop flavor on the tongue.
Moab Brewery Scorpion Pale Ale;Moab, Utah, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moab Brewery;Tap at the brewpub-pours orange with a small fizzy white head and sparse lacing. nose is piney, citric with some mineral aspects. flavors show all of this with some decent bitterness. however, this beer seems somewhat stale and lifeless compared to other breweries doing low abv stuff. Utah needs to get with the rest of the country and stop this stupid insanity!
Moab Brewery Scorpion Pale Ale;Moab, Utah, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moab Brewery;12oz bottle thanks to blutt59. Light orange pour with very little head. Aromas of caramel malt and some faded citrus hops. Flavor is similar and very dry - some toasted malt.

Hoppy bitter hinted aroma with some light fruity hopflower hints. Medium to full palate. Finish is bitter hoppy hinted. Nice hoppy beer.
Moab Brewery Scorpion Pale Ale;Moab, Utah, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moab Brewery;Bottle thanks to Douglas. Poured a clear amber with a gold hue and a near white head that dissipated to the edges. Aroma has a good amount of bread and biscuit with a backing pine note that has a hint of resin. Flavor starts with bread and grain with a bit of growing sweetness and hint of resin bitterness in the finish.

Moab Brewery Scorpion Pale Ale;Moab, Utah, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moab Brewery;bottle, amber colored with an aroma and flavor of dry papery caramel and malt, none too good
Moab Brewery Scorpion Pale Ale;Moab, Utah, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moab Brewery;A: poured into a snifter. As soon as I opened it, foam started gushing out. Once poured a deep, clear amber color radiates from the glass. Massive head, primarily due to over carbonation, with a moderate retention level. Decent lacing. S: nice subtle hoppy aroma, but rather faint. some citrus is about all can pull out of this, along with a nice crystal malt aroma. T: decent flavor, a little too sweet for the style. No major hop characteristic in this one, it is there but very mild. some definite crystal malt flavors. M: ever had a warm Coca-Cola can? this is how carbonated it is. It almost makes the beer undrinkble. crisp and rather thin. D: I couldn�t finish it due to the carbonation level. It seemed that if it were properly carbonated, the flavors and body were a lot better than the score given.
Oakhill Mendip Twister;Radstock, Somerset, England;Stout;Oakhill;Bottle 16/08/2004 Black rich on the palate and strong in alcohol. Some sweetness and fruit flavours. Full roast finish.
Oakhill Mendip Twister;Radstock, Somerset, England;Stout;Oakhill;Bottled, Pasteurised. A dark brown beer with little head. A powerful sour burnt flavour, coffee grounds and thick body. I tried to like this but after 3 bottles I've lost the battle.

Oakhill Mendip Twister;Radstock, Somerset, England;Stout;Oakhill;Doesnt suggest it from the bottle label, but for all the world this is a stout. Big roast coffee aromas, rocky coffee coloured head and bags of roast barley, chocolate and coffee flavour. Subtle hint of hops leads to a dry bitter aftertaste.

Hops Lumberjack Oatmeal Stout;Madison, Georgia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Cola pour with a nice creamy head that leaves nice lacing. The nose is of coffee. Coffee malts with a dump of diacetyl butter toward the finish. Not bad, but just an ok oatmeal stout overall. Soft palate with a medium mouthfeel. Just ok.
Hops Lumberjack Oatmeal Stout;Madison, Georgia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);"Maybe I just haven�t had a stout in a long time, but this one seemed pretty good to me. Roasty with lots of milk-sugar sweetness up front; it wasn�t Founders Breakfast Stout in terms of intensity of flavor or mouthfeel, but it was still pretty good. It was dark with not much head and a pretty thin body. Aroma was pretty faint, but was heavily roasty. Flavor was roasty, with a very prominent up-front sweetness. Mouthfeel was definitely too thin for the style, but was still not watery. Pretty good. I got a draft of this for a $1 at the Hops Grillhouse in Matthews, NC...a decent beer at a great price...not overpaying certainly aids my impressions of this beer. Still, even if it were $3, I�d have it again. $4, and maybe I�d choose something else."

Dark ruby brown, off white head. Aroma is chocolate, malt, molasses, caramel, vanilla. Flavor is the same, piney, chewy, and bitter. Mouth feel is a bit syrupy, yet this stout is on the thin and alky side. This could stand be be better blended and more rounded.

Light coffee mouthfeel. Very impressed and highly drinkable.

McCoys Thompsons Dry Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;McCoy's Public House;Sampled at the Brewpub. Dark with little head. I�m a little dissapointed with this beer. Strong taste of coffee, almost overpowering. Very watery as well. Would be much better if it were a bit thicker. Could use a little work.
McCoys Thompsons Dry Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;McCoy's Public House;Wonderfully balanced, even with such a complex set of flavors. Fresh and aromatic. Roasty, toasty, rich, thick and robust. Not too heavy though. Great sweet vs. bitterness thing going on... and a little sourness too. Some chocolate and coffee hints really gave it the icing on the cake. I loved this beer.
McCoys Thompsons Dry Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;McCoy's Public House;Sampler at the brewpub. It looks like a nitro pour based on the head. Aroma is what it should be for a dry stout, just dry roast with a bit of chocolate. Taste turns downhill with just way too much wateriness, barely any flavor. The body was similarly watery and thin. Yeah, needs work.
McCoys Thompsons Dry Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;McCoy's Public House;Guinness clone that doesn�t quite cut it. A bit on the light/watery side. Pours a decent head, but it lacks overall taste and complexity.
McCoys Thompsons Dry Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;McCoy's Public House;Nitro pour. Creamy and Guinness like but with a sour, lactic flavor. Theres some roastiness to it with just a faint coffee flavor. Body is on the thin side.
Drummond Brothers;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Had this back in �92 or �93. I was passing through Tennessee and hadn�t seen it in my home state so I picked up a six. Kinda reminded me of Natural Light. Real salty tasting.
Drummond Brothers;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Drinkable and weak, don�t pass on a free one. But don�t buy it unless it�s the only thing in the store not made by AB beer butchers.
Drummond Brothers;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"The rating is based on 1975, so it doesn�t mean anything anymore. Drummond Bros. is a beer I tried back in the 70s, when my neighbor across the street had one of the old 50s-style pop machines filled with it. He kept them mighty cold, and it was great. After IO moved from there, I only found Drummond Bros. once more, but had fond memories of it. In 1985, a liquor store I frequented had what was a new beer then, called Tsing Tao, that the owner swore was a great beer, but they could only get in one case a month. One day I was able to buy a six-pack and it was great. My next trip in, I bought another two six-packs. While standing in line, the owner and the guy ahead of me in line got to talking about Tsing Tao. The guy in front of me said it reminded him of Drummond Bros., which was the best beer he�d ever tried. The owner and I both laughed out loud and said, """"No kidding! Drummond Bros. is great beer."" I have not seen it since then. I am glad to see it is still being made, though I wonder if it will still be the same, since the company has been sold three times. I live in the Chocago area, and if anyone knows where it can be had, I�d love to know."
Drummond Brothers;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;I used to buy this stuff in college (not THAT long ago) strictly because it was $6.99 a case. While it�s fairly obvious that my priorities were different then, that may be why I can�t seem to remember anything about the way this beer tasted. I am guessing there�s a reason I haven�t bought it since.
Drummond Brothers;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Can, Lager Glass. Seriously I did not mind this one that much, really not too bad fairly tame in taste but nothing ferociously nasty like I expected. I might actually buy this one again. A decent amount of taste, nothing to much no hops but mild light malts, nothing too sweet. Really not that bad especally for a can.
Drummond Brothers;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;(Can) Pours yellow with a small white head. Taste is really disappointing. Relatively sweet, almost too much so. I think this is due to corn syrup or something. Not very bitter. Dry, almost metallic finish. Not recommended.
Drummond Brothers;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;The initial two reviews must have been plants cause this stuff is pretty gross. It tastes like the concentration of all the dashed hopes of the Rust Belt. It�s sold for $1.50 a can at most local bars, so that also speaks poorly of it�s quality. It�s nothing I�d want again.
Drummond Brothers;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"Well I�ve actually got a story to go along with this one. I�ve mentioned in other ratings that I grew up around alot of swill drinking softball players. My dad played softball with a group of guys just about every weekend while the weather permitted for several years, up until I was about 8 or 9 years old. My dad hated beer but his friends drank like crazy - I guess it was cool in the 70�s to just be able to hold softball games in public parks and have coolers of beer sitting all around. The pitcher would usually keep a cold one in his glove while he pitched. Anyway, the point is that I would find lots of different kinds of empties around these places and became fascinated by the variety and began to collect cans. I gave up that hobby years ago but one of the ones I found one day that really stood out was a can of Drummond Bros. I remember it stood out as a very distinctive can with the ornate design and swords. Fast forward 30 years and I�m driving by Sams Club and get curious about the little liquor store they have attached...I begin to wonder if they might have something my regular store doesn�t. In general the answer was no, but I sure jumped when I saw sixpacks of Drummond Bros. on the shelf for $3. There was no way I could pass that up! Cold in a thistle glass, its a pale gold that approaches the straw color range. Medium fizzy head. Initial aroma hints a sulfur (not light struck, more the rotten egg sulfur). Not a good start. Fortunately that aroma faded and the sulfur was not detectable in the flavor. It was quite clean actually, nothing offensive but also no redeeming qualities either. Excessive carbonation gives it a fuller mouthfeel than it really had. Finishes a bit sticky and wet; not refreshing. A second can featured a distinctive metallic flavor (not drinking directly out of the can)."
Drummond Brothers;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Light yellow and clear a bright white head. Smells like subtle lemons, but taste like absolutely nothing... water, really.
Drummond Brothers;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"Their commercial jingle in the 1970's was ""Share a little brotherly love with Drummond Brother's Beer."" Harmless regional American light lager."
Strohs Dark Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pabst Brewing Company;"Okay guys, I�m going to give you the info many want to know about this brew. I can honestly let you know....... this IS / WAS just plain old Stroh�s. We added what is called Porterine to the Keg�s. It is a high protein caramel coloring used to ""Porter"" beers in commercial breweries. I was charged with weighing up and pouring this sticky stuff into kegs for hours on end. It got all over and made a mess. Ruined several pair of expensive steel toed work shoes with this stuff. We simply racked kegs of Stroh and before a bung was driven in to seal the keg, a dose of Porterine was added. There was no special recipe, no special grains, just a simple additive. Sorry to ruin the mythos of this beer, hope it doesn�t ruin the nostalgia for some. Understand this, it is specially formulated with a specific level of protein in it to match with our Stroh�s Brew. It gave a dark color, silky mouth feel, heavier body and a slight sweetness to the beer. So, there it is, from someone that worked in Brewing and Packaging at Stroh�s Brewery in Winston Salem, NC for 22 years. Oh, btw, the beer, imho, better than regular Stroh�s based on the body, mouth feel, and slight sweetness. Not a beer I�d drink a lot of, but for 3-4 beers, it hit the spot. We drank a lot on the keg line, it was way in the back of the plant away from all the action. Supervisors never came back there, so we all kept a cup of ice cold beer, whatever was being kegged at that moment, lol. Stroh Dark was one of my Fav�s. That said, I wasn�t a fan of most of our beers. I can be honest now, especially since the brand is gone and the plant has been closed since 1999. While working there, I would have swore all Stroh�s Products were the nectar of the God�s. $23 an hour does that, LOL!"
Strohs Dark Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pabst Brewing Company;"Bottle. This rating is in memory of my late dad and mostly on fond memories from long ago. My dad would bring this home from time to time. He loved this brand because it was the best of the ""cheap"" brands. This was the very first dark beer I ever drank. From what I remember it was bitter. Not being used to dark beers I didn�t know this was suppose to be a good thing. I do remember thinking I liked it and my friends at the time making fun of me and saying it taste like motor oil. Anyway, just a memory."
Strohs Dark Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pabst Brewing Company;it was sweet and dark tasting because it was dark and reminded one of brown sugar in the taste profile. it had a bit of body and was a touch syrupy. metal taste in the malt and barley profile that did not lend a hand to its popularity, it was decent.
Strohs Dark Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pabst Brewing Company;Vague memory from years ago, this was the first beer I ever liked. I couldn�t stand the pale s___ everyone else was drinking Sorry to see it go. Mandy was playing on the jukebox that night.
Strohs Dark Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pabst Brewing Company;Not a bad beer of the type, but overrated here. Compared to Ballantine Dark, not as smooth or refreshing. Medium body, good malt aroma. A little rough on the finish compared to the best of this type. Good but not top echelon!
Strohs Dark Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pabst Brewing Company;Pours a little darker. Aromas of corn, hops, and you know the rest. Flavor is a little more pronounced in this beer, a little more bitter and more burnt flavor. Just a bit more flavor than most.
Strohs Dark Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pabst Brewing Company;Anybody know where to get this beer in Michigan?............................
Strohs Dark Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pabst Brewing Company;I had this in a joint in Chicago. Rich brown color with medium head--light lace. Aroma is light but with some roasted malts detectable along with hint of hops. Flavor has a discernible malt bottom with some roastiness to it, mild hop bitterness on top...slight tang in the finish. Body is moderate, and elements are relatively in balance...one of the better products by this brewery.
Strohs Dark Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pabst Brewing Company;This used to be the best beer, now that Pabst brews it I have not seen it in its former hometown of Detroit. If anyone knows plesase post it.
Strohs Dark Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Pabst Brewing Company;I drank picthers of this in the '80s in Pontiac, Michigan. It was either I was old enough to get bad hangovers or this is hangover beer. I don't know which. I never puked it though.

Pump House Raspberry Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Pump House Brewery;Although it smelled very good, it doesn''t taste like raspberries at all. I personnally love wheat beer so I gotta say this one was good.
Pump House Raspberry Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Pump House Brewery;Not impressed with this Pump House product! I can't stand the taste of this stuff. It was all I could do to finish my glass of draft. It smelled very good almost like home made Raspberry Jam but the taste killed it. I don't think I would ever try this one again
Topvar 11.5% Svetl�;Topo��any, Slovakia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Pivovary Topvar (SABMiller);From Oct 2005 Poured from bottle: small head that dissipated quickly leaving just a fine lacing around the glass. Smell is all malt...very sweet in fact. Taste is also all malt for me with only a slight hint of hops in the finish. All in all, I find that the lack of hops in this one works and the thirst quencher factor is right up there. I recommend it.

Papago Churchill Wheat Wine;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Papago Brewing;On tap at the Strong Ale Fest 08. Pours an orange amber color. Fruit and sweet malt. Notes of honey and citrus and some wheat coming through. It�s okay, but not very complex.
Papago Churchill Wheat Wine;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Papago Brewing;On tap at Papago. Really interesting beer here...dark honey colored beer with just a smal white ring for a head. Extremely fruity, both in aroma and in taste. Flavor is sticky sweet Welch�s grape juice, Macintosh apple, and wheat. Almost syrupy...could pour this on pancakes...you wouldn�t even know it�s alcohol. Tasty but would want this to be a rare treat.
Papago Churchill Wheat Wine;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Papago Brewing;On tap at Papago - Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a thin off white head. Light lacing. Aroma is estery and vinous. Flavor is esters, apple, and vinous. Palate is dry. Light to medium body. A good beer.
Papago Churchill Wheat Wine;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Papago Brewing;Tap at Pap. Couldnt believe this was a barleywine. Almost dead-on apple juice effect, right down to the aftertaste. That this is nearly ten percent makes this a work of art.
Papago Churchill Wheat Wine;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Papago Brewing;Tap at Strong Ale 2008. Pours orange with a tan ring. Nose is slightly sweet. Taste is sweet, ok, and the wheat comes through nicely.

Poured a deeper and cloudy golden-amber color with a very small sized off white head. Aromas of floralness, wheaty, and toasty. Tastes of the same floralness, wheat, toast, and I was getting a very light citrus.
Papago Churchill Wheat Wine;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Papago Brewing;"Thanks to Rustychiles for sharing the growler. Pours very cloudy from the wheat, a nice ruddy orange hue. Aroma was quite inscrutable. Almost reminiscent of a belgian ale in some regards - lots of fruity phenolic smells. Taste is extremely smooth, no hop bitterness to speak of. Pronounced wheat and fruity flavors. Very nice, very enjoyable. Hides the alcohol like a champ; I couldn�t taste it at all."
Papago Churchill Wheat Wine;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Papago Brewing;Pours a deep orange/brown with a small white head. Aroma of wheat, caramel, sweet malt, esthers, yeast. Flavor is sweet bready malt, yeast, fruits, bananas, cloves, nuts, spices. A touch of bitterness in the finish. A lot going on in here, not sure what to make of it but it�s pretty good.
Papago Churchill Wheat Wine;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Papago Brewing;On tap at Papago. Pours a hazy deep brown color with a foamy off-white head that lasted through the glass. Some definite wheat characteristics in the aroma, most notably toasted grain, banana and yeast. Also sweet malt, fruit and alcohol. Unfortunately, that didn�t all quite come together in the flavor like I hoped it would. All of the elements were there, they just seemed to clash instead of blend. Seemed a bit thin on the palate as well. Still, not a bad brew overall.
Papago Maduro Nut Brown;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Papago Brewing;Nice medium brown color with a tan head. Mild nut brown aroma, some malt notes. Does have a little nutty flavor. Medium bodied, fairly smooth. Tasty but nothing to get to excited over.
Papago Maduro Nut Brown;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Papago Brewing;A full bodied nut brown ale, makes Newcastle taste like water. This has to be the darkest nut brown I have ever seen. Very nutty taste and a clean beer. Sorry nut brown fans, only available on draught.
Papago Maduro Nut Brown;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Papago Brewing;I had this on draught at Stone's 7th anniversary party. Appearance: It poured a hazy brown color with a small tan head. Aroma: It had a slightly toasty aroma, but nothing that would impress you. Flavor: Being that this is a brown ale, I was expecting something a little more malty. Maybe a little more toasty. Maybe a little more anything. All in all, it was pretty mediocre. Nothing special
Papago Maduro Nut Brown;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Papago Brewing;Nice clear brown body with medium tan head. Aroma is quite sweet caramel, malty, nutty. Taste is medium sweet, nutty, caramel. Nice beer, but nothing special. Finishes dry.
Papago Maduro Nut Brown;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Papago Brewing;Reddish brown with a nice thick insulation...Aroma didn't give much but a slice of roastedness.. slightly fruity with a bunch o' nuts..nutty finish..Started weak and grew as it was savored...all in all..a nutty cocoa ambrosia
Papago Maduro Nut Brown;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Papago Brewing;Nice beer...................................................................
Papago Maduro Nut Brown;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Papago Brewing;Pours a deep brown, large chocolate head and decent lace that clings to the glass. Nose is nutty sweet, malts and caramel, with just a hint of hops. Sweet front, middle light to medium, the finish is nicely hopped, moderate carbonation and some what acidic. A real pleasure to quaff, and a real top notch brown ale.

DB Bitter;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);A 90s favorite that seemed to have taken the rarest of the back-seats in recent years, Affordable 3.5% beer meaning you dont risk a nasty hangover the following day, No longer do they sell in the 500ml cans but just the standard 12x 330ml boxes (av. $14 doz.)
DB Bitter;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Dull and foamy and all around boring. But at least it doesnt have the nasty taste that accompanies most mainstream beers
DB Bitter;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);It smells sweet, strange. The taste is watery, bit foamy, sweet. Boring and almost tasteless.
DB Bitter;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);330ml can from The Beer Cellar. Rating from April 2013. Basic grain aroma, beer is thin and watery and lacks flavour.
DB Bitter;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Not a beer I recall as being significantly bitter oddly enough. Same colour as mainstream draught in New Zealand, same flavour. Colourful packaging and sponsorship of a rugby league team made this popular for a while. I�m not I�ve seen it for a while. Anyway, since when was 3.5% abv full strength beer?
DB Bitter;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);"Didn�t realise 3.5% was considered to be ""full strength"". Sweet cardboard nose, and pours a dark amber. For the price this beer is better than a lot of others out there, but definitely a working mans beer."
DB Bitter;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);It�s a bitter version of export which makes it slightly better or bitter. Also rarely avalible now ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
DB Bitter;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);"Can. I recently rated Southern Draught (another NZ dark lager) and said that ""among its peers, not bad"". Well, this beer is one of its peers, and it actually makes me think I may have UNDER-RATED Southern Draught! There isn�t any of the toastiness that made SD somewhat palatable. Instead there is a weak caramel and apple flavour, marred by a slightly stinky wet-dishragginess. This is truly poor by any standard."
DB Bitter;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Bottled. A dark golden beer with a lazing beige head. The aroma is sweet with notes of malt and caramel, while the flavor is sweet and mainly malty with a bitter finish. The body is thin. Thanks Papsoe for sharing.
DB Bitter;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Clear golden with medium off white head. Sweet malty aroma with fruity and caramel notes. Flavor is fruity with caramel notes.
DB Black Draught;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);My expectations were fairly low as Dominion Breweries aren�t really known for making quality products/ I expectations were on the nose with this dark lager (which is what it truly is, cold brewed just with dark malts). Bland, not really any lingering bitterness to speak of and confined to the taps of student pubs and boozers. Don�t get your hopes up by seeing a black beer on tap because you�ll be sorely disappointed by this one.

Hoffbrau;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tasman Bitter Limited;On tap at local restaurant, pale yellow with a thin head. Aroma is of light grain and a hint of metal, the flavor is of watered down corn with some bread in the finish, not completely terrible, but not good.
Hoffbrau;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tasman Bitter Limited;Smooth, light, but leaves a kick on ur palate that good German beers are known for. Not sure y others dont agree. I enjoyed this one.
Hoffbrau;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tasman Bitter Limited;Crushed with Jakebra at a random bar in Milwaukee during their street parade thing or something. Don�t drink this beer. It sucked.
Hoffbrau;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tasman Bitter Limited;Had a good head nice golden colour,head not lasting,aroma strong earthy bread notes,flavour woody earthy tangy,nice bitter,goes down okay but with a watery finish to make it on the weak tasting side.

Wachusett Blueberry;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wachusett Brewing Company;Poured the bottle over some fresh blueberries that had a touch of sugar and the head was amazing, long lasting, fluffy white. Nice change from my usual ne style IPAs, which I've grown tired of til I find a new one to love. I always liked this beer on draft, only when there are blueberries added. Brings out the good natural blueberry flavor. Only blueberry beer I've ever liked
Wachusett Blueberry;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wachusett Brewing Company;Can taster pour at Julio's Liquors. Appearance is clear dark yellow/light brown with nice sparkle, no head, no lacing. Aroma was subtle mix of sweet and tart blueberry, cracker malts. Taste as aroma. Palate is light-to-medium bodied with smooth texture, soft carbonation and finish as taste. Overall, often fruit beers overwhelm you with fruit flavor and taste but, if anything, this could have used more.
Wachusett Blueberry;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wachusett Brewing Company;Another one from my in-laws as a gift for Christmas, I really like the blueberry taste in this beer. Nice, light and refreshing. Well done.
Wachusett Blueberry;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wachusett Brewing Company;Can poured a clear yellow with a small lingering white head. Aromas of bread, blueberry and a hint of yeast. Palate was light b8died and smooth. Flavors of bread and blueberry with a smooth finish.
Wachusett Blueberry;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wachusett Brewing Company;Interesting aroma that definitely reminds me of a blueberry muffin. Palate isn't particularly complex but I feel the need to compliment this beer for balancing just the right amount of blueberry notes without taking away from the basis of the beer.
Wachusett Blueberry;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wachusett Brewing Company;Of course it starts with a bold blueberry muffin aroma. Clear golden body without much head though well carbonated. Despite a distinct blueberry muffin taste it does so without being overly sweet. It has a hint of grain maltiness and finishes clean and on the dry side. .
Wachusett Blueberry;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wachusett Brewing Company;"DATE: October 7, 2017... OCCASION: Big Blue day (Independence soccer, PSU wins) deserves a blue(berry) beer... GLASSWARE: Lindemans flute... explodes into the glass with a massive array of bubbles, speeding upward to a sizzling white foamy head... the body is watery yellow and mostly transparent... the aroma is blueberry, of course, light wine tannins, cracker malts and lemon zest make for a mixed bag... mouthfeel is soft, fizzy, dry at its finish, with a light body that begs to be drained... the finish also burns with some residual that leaves the experience lacking... the blueberry is soft, melded with malts to create a slightly ""dirty,"" earthy texture... the herbal, vegetable influence detracts from the experience... not really an enjoyable beer, but it is a bit refreshing... could see where the Smirnoff drinkers might fancy this one..."
Wachusett Blueberry;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wachusett Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle. Medium gold color. Small creamy white head. Grainy malt nose hints at subtle blueberry. Flavor is light grain with notes of corn and berry. Bland and disappointing.
Wachusett Blueberry;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Wachusett Brewing Company;Tried at the Concord Inn in MA during my brothers wedding in 2010. Not all that much blueberry character, but it came with blueberries floating in the glass. That helped.

Cerveza Quisqueya;La Vega, Dominican Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Vegana;Not the most impressive Pilsner, or even the best tasting in the DR. Pale gold and stale. Light grassy bitterness at the end. Tried in Dajabon in 2017.
Cerveza Quisqueya;La Vega, Dominican Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Vegana;From old tasting notes. Slightly hazy medium gold color with an average sized white head. Faint sour hop aroma. Slightly sweet, malty foretaste. tangy middle. Grassy hop finish.

Cerveza Quisqueya;La Vega, Dominican Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Vegana;Bottle - Grains and honey with a bit of bread. Pale fizzy gold. Tastes just as it smells. A bit sweet and fizzy like all Dominican beers, with a touch more flavour.
Cerveza Quisqueya;La Vega, Dominican Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Vegana;355ml bottle. Pours dark orange with a small head. Aroma is grainy with corn and lemon. Taste is grainy with alcohol.

Cerveza Soberana;La Vega, Dominican Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Vegana;Aroma is one of beer�s most complex features. Aroma is propelled by lively CO2 and dampened by pillowy heads - especially nitrogen foam. Click on a term below to add it to your tasting notes.
Cerveza Soberana;La Vega, Dominican Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Vegana;Tried two bottles of this in the Dominican, and had to dump both. Quite possibly the worst commercial lager I�ve ever had. Aroma is completely nasty- canned vegetable, rotting compost, couldn�t get anything past that. Taste of rotting vegetables. Just horrendous. This beer is appropriately named, as if this was the only beer available I would always be sober.
Cerveza Soberana;La Vega, Dominican Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Vegana;341 mL bottle: Light golden color, no head and very carbonated. Smells OK but tastes like a malt liquor. No discernable hops, poor quality ingredients and watered down mouthfeel. The name is a good source for a few laughs though!
Cerveza Soberana;La Vega, Dominican Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Vegana;A step above bud, but that�s not saying much. Small amounts of hop character, no maltiness to speak of. Drinkable if it is free and it is a hot day.
Cerveza Soberana;La Vega, Dominican Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Vegana;This beer could quite possibly be the worst swill one will ever try. Avoid this beer, even when in the bleak beer country of the Dominican Republic. It smells like an old fraternity house.
Cerveza Soberana;La Vega, Dominican Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Vegana;Okay. If I have to...If there is anything else..if I am really thirsty..I will probably drink it...but maybe..I won�t!!
Cerveza Soberana;La Vega, Dominican Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Vegana;Green bottle on location in Santo Domingo. Just a bit darker yellow than Bud Light or Brahma. Just a bit tastier, too. Still, really a forgettable lawnmower beer, this side of soda water.
Cerveza Soberana;La Vega, Dominican Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Vegana;Amazingly bad. Worse than Atlas. Dirty water, but with less taste. Pale, tasteless, with a hint of floral hops.
Cerveza Soberana;La Vega, Dominican Republic;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervecer�a Vegana;"Bottle - Pours a light golden yellow with a sizable white fizzy head. Sort of a skunky aroma... green glass just cannot hold up to the sunlight like dark amber glass. Flavor is mildly hoppy with a mega-commercial corn undertone. A decent puch at 6% alcohol. Reminds me of a Canadian beer. Aside from all of that; this beer, when drunk icy cold (and looking at looking at white sandy beaches and palm trees), was just about ""perfect""!!"
Quincy Ships WazzAle;Quincy, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Quincy Ships Brewing Co.;Light flowery hops, with a soft palate. The small off-white head was short in this world, as was its lightly bitter finish. Very light for a holiday beer, but has some interesting flavors.
Quincy Ships Alternator Double Alt;Quincy, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Quincy Ships Brewing Co.;On draught, served in 8 Oz glasses: Nice full head with a cookie dough taste. The heavy sweetness became a bit much after the first pint of it. Wonderful in small doses.

Slightly sweet, moderately bitter, quite spicy, gently fruity and slightly floral taste of coriander, orange peel, some vanilla and a touch of banana, followed by a short, moderately bitter, a little tart, gently yeasty and spicy finish. Almost medium-bodied, gently effervescent mouthfeel, average to lively carbonation. Pleasant Wit, very refreshing, maybe even a bit too spicy and fruity.
St. Bernardus Wit / Blanche;Watou, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;St. Bernardus Brouwerij;Bottle, 2019/09/11. Not drank for a time I can remember of. I was hyped to taste it again and it delivered: simply the best witbier I have ever tasted. The aftertaste bouquet is glorious and complex.

Bitter End Bat City Lager;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;I had this once while in Austin for a visit. I prefer my beer strong yet smooth.

Bitter End Bat City Lager;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;On draught. Nice lacing and head above a gold/amber, clear beer. It has a nice malt flavor like an octoberfest actually. Very clean and delicious.
Bitter End Bat City Lager;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Not bad in the least, but being as tame as it is (or well made, but simply a simple lager) I feel much like a kid forced to eat his vegetables before getting some dessert. Now if I can get some Sour Prick or Happy Jacks I�ll gladly have another.
Bitter End Bat City Lager;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Clear light amber in color with a thin layer of head and some lacing. Thin body with a hint of malt in flavor but still more flavor than most light lagers. Watery texture with a weak dry finish. With that said, this beer is not made for people who love beer like myself. There are NO off flavors in this beer. If there was it would be hard to hide. It is a clean beer.
Bitter End Bat City Lager;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;On tap at Bitter End. Pours medium golden-amber with a small head. Malty aroma and flavor that is balanced with the hops. Something missing though. Didn�t do much for me.

Flavor has some solid bitter notes with some fresh lake water notes. Smooth palate. Good smooth drinking brewpub lager, should please the masses. Reminds me of Sam Adams - perhaps it should be labeled as a Premium Lager.
Bitter End EZ Wheat;Austin, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;On tap. The admittedly Coors Light substitute for those who don�t like/know micros from the brewery. Light, clean, inoffensive, and yes, dull.
Bitter End EZ Wheat;Austin, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Tap. Light body with a bubble thin. Almost nothing. Some wheat, some citric acid. The complete lack off lavor reminds me of why they force the lemon on the rim of the glass.
Bitter End EZ Wheat;Austin, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;On tap. Aromas of sweet citrus. Tasted of honey, and some hops. Feels weird in your mouth, kinda sticky. Lame
Bitter End EZ Wheat;Austin, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Pours a watery piss-yellow. The aroma is weak, and the flavor is a Pabst without the flavor.

Leave it to the Germans, guys- y�all haven�t got ""it."""

Bitter End EZ Wheat;Austin, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"On tap at Bitter End. Light golden in color with little to no head (but it is well carbonated in the mouth). Almost none of the aroma or flavor one would associate with a wheat beer. Very light; probably only suited for drinking at the pool or after yard work."
Bitter End EZ Wheat;Austin, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Had on tap at Bitter End in Austin. Medium golden pour, faint white head, slight haziess.

Bitter End EZ Wheat;Austin, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Clear golden with a thin white head. Faintly sweet, but mostly non-existent aroma. Body is mild and lightly sweet with a tangy orange citrus finish. A touch of hops runs throughout. A drinkable American wheat.
Bitter End Sledgehammer Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;(Growler, well cared for) Dark brown but not an Imperial, with a mostly white, slightly off-white dense ring of head.

Bitter End Sledgehammer Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Pitch black body with brown hues near the crown. Aroma is a hybrid of the citrus common to IPA�s and roasted malt that is a trait of stouts. Flavor is sweet chocolate and roasted malt, with a tinge of hops in the background. Palate coats like a can of Sherwin-Williams. Very good stout.
Bitter End Sledgehammer Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Black body with a tan head. Aroma of roasty grain, coffee, and chocolate. Taste was rich with a roasted coffe flavor, also some light chocolate flavors.

Bitter End 8th Anniversary Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Of the 7 beers I tried at this place, the Anniversary 8 was the worst. It was kind of like a pale ale but it was badly imbalanced and it was the third in a string of three beers I tried with God-awful aftertastes.
Bitter End 8th Anniversary Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;This brew is very complex and has lots of character. Medium bodied, dominated by hops. The hoppiness led to an unpleasant aftertaste that I didnt like.
Bitter End Austin Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"My ""house beer"" while a regular at BE. Great hop flavors in a well balanced tasty beer."
Bitter End Austin Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;On tap. Amber color with no head. Strong floral aroma. Taste was nice and hoppy, with a nice malt sweetness in the back. Yum
Bitter End Austin Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Good sign to me that as good as this is, it�s far from my favorite as I�ve had such good beers here. Pale ale - all the descriptions I might give aren�t good enough if you haven�t managed to drag yourself in tis place at least once.
Bitter End Austin Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Pours with a deep golden hue and a nice head with lingering lace. Aroma is predominantly floral but there is a faint sweetness in the background. Flavor is more of the same floral ingredients, with a mostly rose-type flavor. The palate is slippery and it slides nicely along the tongue. A quality effort, but more like an IPA than a Pale Ale.
Bitter End Austin Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Very sweet and hoppy, fresh flavors and aroma... sweet bubble gum and sugar flavor, with a crisp peach flavor and a marginally dry finish.

Bitter End Austin Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;On tap at The Bitter End. Pours cloudy orange with a small white head. Very plesant citrus hop aroma. Smells orangy and a bit lemon citrus from the hop side, and there are also some aromatic hops. Flavor is a very sharp hop bitterness with a crisp hop resin character that sits towards the back of the mouth. It also has a bit of an earthy finish.
Bitter End Austin Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;(Growler) Pours a light copper body with a medium-sized white head. Much hoppy aroma than flavor. A little on the watery side.
Bitter End Austin ESB;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;I agree with AceOfHearts about this brew - a horrendous aftertaste (somewhat metallic) utterly ruins this beer. Darn near undrinkable. Like sucking on a nickel.
Bitter End Austin ESB;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;A tasty bitter. A little bit of hops on the nose, creamy texture, wonderful malty aftertaste.
Bitter End Austin ESB;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;I thought this was the best of the bitter end beers I had. Very good malt-hop transition, smooth sweet finish with a hint of pepper. Rerate: much better the second time around....taste and nose much like fullers, but it still had a slightly adjuct/cereal aftertaste which holds it back.
Bitter End Austin ESB;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;The terrible aftertaste completely ruins anything good this beer had to offer.

McDuffs Classic Gold;Dunedin, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;McDuffs Brewery;My bottle declares this to be a wheat ale. Pours clear golden with a rapidly fading white cap. Very odd aromas of buttered popcorn, dish-soap (honestly!) and clean straw. The palate is downright unpleasant-- watery malt with unmistakable soapy flavour. Truly unpleasant.
McDuffs Classic Gold;Dunedin, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;McDuffs Brewery;Pale straw yellow. Big carbonation. Slightly a Sprite type aroma, Faint wheat notes but not very exciting.
McDuffs Classic Gold;Dunedin, New Zealand;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;McDuffs Brewery;it was pretty strange for me going into the brewery/bottleshop and getting a 2 litre plastic bottle of this filled up. oddly belgian aroma, some hint of fresh hops but generally very watery and of no interest after the first sip

McDuffs Original Ale;Dunedin, New Zealand;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;McDuffs Brewery;Bottle from the brewery. Pours a light amber, or dark gold, depending on how you choose to look at it. Aroma of sweet grain tainted with a dirty ashiness. This carries onto to the palate, dirty malt with a vaguely marzipan-like sweetness. Not nice at all. This and the wheat ale have been complete duds, I�m a little reticent to try the Edinburgh Draft now!
McDuffs Original Ale;Dunedin, New Zealand;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;McDuffs Brewery;pretty poor stuff. flat, barely any flavour apart from vague acidic grain, no body, no kick

McDuffs Original Ale;Dunedin, New Zealand;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;McDuffs Brewery;Remarkably similar to their Classic Gold. It's almost hard to tell that this is a different beer, but it tasters slightly more bitter.

On tap at Toronado Barley Wine Festival �05 in San Francisco, CA 2/19/05. 1997 Vintage. So this might not be the ""95"" mentioned in the listing here, but it IS the Big Head Barley and Hops Barley Wine, and RateBeer doesn�t really distinguish between vintages like that anyway. I�d imagine this listing is just so old and long-forgotten that IT will be changed, not my rating. But here goes. . . One of the best beers of the Festival this year. Dark murky brown in color-- like dissolved brown sugar-- with no black. Hauntingly rich aroma, wonderfully complex with strong bitterness and many layers of malt interest-- caramel, toffee, some dark fruit. Big roasty flavor in the finish, surprising accompaniment to the hoppy bitterness. Amazingly all over the place in its flavor and aroma, but not sloppy or muddled. One of the special standouts among the large line-up of big beers. It had more going on in its flavor than perhaps any other beer there."
Barley and Hopps Big Head Barleywine;San Mateo, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Barley and Hopps;This was the first place barley wine at the 2003 Toronado Barleywine Festival. A beautiful creamy pour that reminds me of a nitrogen head. Malt and fruit flavors are nicely balanced. Tastey - but not my favorite.
Barley and Hopps Big Head Barleywine;San Mateo, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Barley and Hopps;On tap at the 2003 Toronado Barleywine Festival: Creamy. Somewhat syrupy. Great malt/hop balance. Some bitterness coming through. Ages very, very well. (Note: This beer took 1st place in the festival.)
Barley and Hopps Big Head Barleywine;San Mateo, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Barley and Hopps;Woah Nelly! This is a great ale, gentlemen. Impressively juicy and fruity, malty as all get out, with a flush of hops at the end. Like the name suggests, there aren't a lot of bells and whistles here, just pure-brewed ale: the way I like 'em.
21st Amendment Lower de Boom Barleywine;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;21st Amendment Brewery;For me, this beer tastes like a strong ale, infused with rum and brown sugar.
21st Amendment Lower de Boom Barleywine;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;21st Amendment Brewery;"8.4 oz skinny can with a 17 Dec. 2015 canning date. Look- Copper colored clear body with a thin off-white head that soon fades to a durable partial coat and ring. Aroma- dark fruits and sweet malts. Flavor- malty with hints of figs, plums, fruitcake and piney hops. Feel- low carbonation; full body; light warming but no heat even with 11.5% ABV, Overall- except for being more hoppy than average, this is a solid, mainstream barleywine."

21st Amendment Lower de Boom Barleywine;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;21st Amendment Brewery;How have I not rated this ... I had it fresh and had it aged on multiple occasions. Few occasions I pack these in my suitcase to drink at Disney. Small can. Mahogany color with a thin sized head. Dark fruits, caramel, citrus, and malty. Alcohol content well hidden
21st Amendment Lower de Boom Barleywine;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;21st Amendment Brewery;11.5 oz can that looks smaller. Amber in color and it is just a bit cloudy. A beige head is uneven and so is the lacing. A malty and complex fruit aroma. The fruit is over ripe. Some spice and yeast, too. This is big and hot to taste. Raisins, cinnamon, earth, and harshness that makes this a sipper. Some sourness. Finish is sweet and maltier.
21st Amendment Lower de Boom Barleywine;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;21st Amendment Brewery;A rather formidable barleywine, boasting both the expected deep caramel-toffee-nut malt profile and a surprisingly fruity, balanced citrus hop backbone. The sweetness never grows overbearing, while the orange and lemon notes couple with berry undertones to provide a punch-like complexity before settling into a prolonged but manageable bitterness. A year has taken away almost all the boozy warmth, leaving a chewy, hefty texture that makes it way too easy to kill a can. Damn fine beer.
21st Amendment Lower de Boom Barleywine;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;21st Amendment Brewery;Very good barley wine. Good malting, smooth drinker though not thickest mouthfeel. Still carbonation, hops in aroma and in finish. Tasty stuff.
21st Amendment Lower de Boom Barleywine;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;21st Amendment Brewery;"American-style barleywine apparently named after Cornelius De Boom, a Belgian entrepreneur drawn to San Francisco during the Gold Rush, making it to Honorary Belgian Consul with a street named after him - just round the corner from 21st Amendment. From a smallish and narrow, 250 ml can at BeerTemple in Amsterdam; apparently the first craft beer filled in this volume, intended to translate the old small English barleywine bottle concept to the 21st-century �craft beer can� idea. Lightly lacing, egg-white, moussy, stable head over a hazy deep orangey amber coloured beer. Intense, very seductive aroma of biscuit, orange zest, dried mango, brown rum, honey liqueur, marmelade, parsley, pink grapefruit, bourbon, lychee, pine resin, mandarin. Intense, yet �clean� fruitiness in the onset, a basket filled to the brim with ripe mango, lychee, granadilla and tangerine, sweet and �candied� with a balancing sourishness around it, soft carbo, very vinous, very oily, thick mouthfeel. Very biscuity, bit caramelly and very lightly nutty malt body, thick, syrupy and rich with honeyish sugary sweetness on top but near the end dried by a very potent hop dosage, very resiny, piney, grapefruity and �tropical fruity�, orange peel and exotic pepper bitterness, paired with a glow of bourbon-like, very warming yet non-astringent alcohol. Very intense beer even for this style, but utterly delicious and rich, potentially the best American-style barleywine I ever had, with strong IIPA-like tendencies like many other Californian interpretations of this style."

21st Amendment Lower de Boom Barleywine;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;21st Amendment Brewery;Can from New Beer Distributors @ home. Clear deep amber colour. Off white head with short retention. Aroma�s: big caramel malts, sweetish, a bit sweaty cheese. Retronasal it�s sweet, caramel malts, light resin. Flavour is moderate to full sweet with light to moderate bitterness. Alcohol feel is quite sharp, hot. Medium bodied. Long finish, slightly dry and above moderate bitter. Pretty nice.
Slavutych Ekstra;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Hazed straw gold with a white head. Nose is cereal in quality. Flavor starts off okay, but falls off to pretty mediocre at best. You begin with a slightly sweet cereal flavor, but it falls off too quickly. Feel is decent, but drinkability is weak. With no great characteristic that puts it apart from others like it, why bother? I can imagine this is the macro swill of Ukraine. Here in the U.S. we call it drain pour.
Slavutych Ekstra;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);"Date: 03/17/2007 Mode: Bottle Source: Tasting clear yellow, wispy white head, sweet malt aroma with floral hops and a hint of corn, light sweet malt flavor, well balanced with nice hop flavor and bitterness, quite drinkable for the style Aroma: 4/10; Appearance: 6/10; Flavor: 5/10; Palate: 5/10; Overall: 9/20 Rating: 2.4/5.0 Drinkability: 8/10 Score: **/4"
Slavutych Ekstra;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);A nice head, a golden color, and a yeasty honey scent. Moves along the palate like a lightly frothy American lager. A mildly bitter taste with a touch of sweetness and spice. This is a little above average - perfectly drinkable, but not superior.
Slavutych Ekstra;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Poured a clear light golden color with a medium but quickly diminishing white head. Sweet aroma with fruity notes and a light DMS. Malty flavor is semi-sweet and light with a mild bitter and hopped finish. Hint of alcohol most likely from such a light body.
Slavutych Ekstra;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Slightly malty aroma, nice golden color, not too pale. Smooth with slightly bitter finish. Roasted malt taste with slight sweetness. Pretty good, easy to drink.
Slavutych Ekstra;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Pale blond color. Some aroma of malt, paper, vanilla, white pepper, soap. Dry mouthfeel, some taste of cereals paper and soap. High bitterness. Strange.
Slavutych Ekstra;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Good, slightly yellowish tinted head, leaving some lace over deep golden beer. Very creamy nose, milk-ripe grain, bit grassy, and sweet malts, even caramel in the finish. More caramel in the taste. Slight bitterness, as from bitter almonds, ending in dry grain. Nothing very outspoken. Light to medium bodied. Bit spritzy MF, hints at alcohol. Better than most E.E. swill, but still not a very interesting beer.
Slavutych Ekstra;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Pours a clear yellow gold with a dense and frothy two-finger head. Very lacy. Smells grassy with a faint sourness. Sweet, corny aromas. Tastes of grassy malt, some faint DMS flavors, slight metallic taste. Clean finish and some strident low-level noble hops in the finish and aftertaste. Easy drinker but lacking.
Slavutych Ekstra;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);From a 1pt. 9oz.brown bottle with EXTRA on the front label and a gold foiled wrapped neck, no bottled/freshness date. Made a decent appearance, poured a hazy pale golden yellow with a foamy white head that settled into a fine lacing, moderate carbonation. Had a rubbing alcohol nose, clean overall, also some faint pale grainy maltiness with a dull spiciness as well . A crisp, alcohol biting light bodied mouth feel, below average drinkability. Grainy alcohol taste, bland tasting overall, a little spicy, floral hoppiness in the middle and a dry alcoholic finish. This is a below average lager, cheap in price, and I have a feeling cheaply made as well.
Slavutych Ekstra;Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Bottle with the export label for the US. Poured very pale yellow with a substantial foam head, although little to no carbonation. Interestingly clean aroma, like fresh laundry. Slippery on the tongue with a corn syrup feel, and a starchy finish. Eh.
