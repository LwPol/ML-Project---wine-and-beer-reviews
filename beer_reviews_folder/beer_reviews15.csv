Founders Imperial IPA;Grand Rapids,Michigan,United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"Nice balanced taste. No bitterness to speak of. The high ABV is very well masked. I would not have concidered it an ""Imperial"" have I not seen the alcohol pertentage. Needs more volume and hop flavor."

Nose..deep, dark chocolate, bonfire ash, burnt molasses and vanillin. Palate...full, opulent and coating with plenty of oaky bitterness, and mounds of bittersweet chocolate. The mid palate is dry, earthy and loamy with cassis and and toasted hazelnuts. The finish is lengthy, mildly bitter and oozing with cocoa mass.

Founders Imperial IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Descent IIPA, had late in my round of drinking at Founders, so it may have taken away a little from this brew. Very grapefruity, some pineyness, huge hops. Alcohol makes itself qutie noticeable, but still pretty rock solid.

Augustiner Pils;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Augustiner-Bräu;330ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5.6%. Lemon-yellow. Large but manageable OK-lasting head. Grassy meadow, somewhat lemony aroma with some sweetcorn malt. Moderate carbonation, zingy lemony grassy hops, a tad earthy, into a sweet, almost but not quite sweetcorny malt that really plays its hand well and seems to straddle the flavour profiles of lager and ale malt. Really nice balance to this (it's definitely sweet, yet not that sweet, it's definitely bitter, but not that bitter, and it's hard to say which it is more than the other!), and a juicy, well-hopped pilsner at that. A must-try for lager drinkers to see what they're missing - all things said this is indubitably a lager, and yet...if you enjoy this, you can enjoy a pale ale, and from then...
Augustiner Pils;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Augustiner-Bräu;"Aroma; floral scents, pale malts, some apoteka, minerals. Look; offwhite good head, clear straw golden body.

Augustiner Pils;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Augustiner-Bräu;Definitely on the high end for hop contribution from a german pils.

Buckeye 76 India Pale Ale;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but is a summer release so it should be pretty fresh. Pours fairly crystal clear orange amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, floral, grass, lemon zest, pine, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Good amount of pine resin bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, citrus rind, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a moderate malt balance and minimal cloying bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly slick and very sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice DIPA. All around nice balance of hop and malt notes; and quite smooth to sip on. No complaints, a very enjoyable offering."
Buckeye 76 India Pale Ale;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;Why the high ratings for this one? Pours very, very dark for an IPA, almost barleywine territory. Tan head. Huge malty aroma coupled with some pine needles. Taste is sweet and slightly bitter. Finishes sweet with a lingering bitterness of pine. No juicy tropical hops here, but I guess that’s what they were going for with this one. Not very good though.
Buckeye 76 India Pale Ale;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;Pours copper with great lacing. Aroma of grapefruit. Taste is citrus hops with a very sizeable malty backbone and dry finish. Great single-hopped 2IPA.

Buckeye Cleveland Lager;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buckeye Brewing Company;On tap pours a amber color with a thin white head. Smells like beer and doesn’t have anything special about the aroma. Has a medium-light mouthfeel and has a decent flavor. Is more on the crisp side and doesn’t really do much for me. This seems like just another typical lager.
Buckeye Cleveland Lager;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buckeye Brewing Company;Copper color. Hoppy, grassy nose with undertones of some kind of crystal malt (caravienne?) and other slightly sweet notes. Sure are some hoppy flavors packed in here. Who would have thought that would be a characteristic of a Buckeye beer??? Nontheless, this is a tasty little lager that finished relatively clean with a little residual hop resin on the palate. A nice beer to either start or finish a session at Buckeye, or the Mariott down the street.
Buckeye Wheat Cloud;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buckeye Brewing Company;Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a murky yellow color with a medium sized foamy white head that faded and left decent lacing. The aroma was yeasty, musty and a bit bready. The flavor was bread, honey, yeast and faint notes of orange, phenol and must. Banana comes out as it warms. Long finish. Moderately full bodied. Solid.

The aroma and flavor have some banana, bubblegum, pale wheat malts, light spice, thin, seems a little off like the bottle could have been old, either way very average and not worth revisiting.
Buckeye Wheat Cloud;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buckeye Brewing Company;Hazed yellow pour with creamy white head and lace. Wheaty malt and clove on the nose. Flavor is clove, coriander, and wheat malt. Medium bodied and fizzy. A bit lighter in color than I would have thought but still pretty good
Buckeye Wheat Cloud;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buckeye Brewing Company;draft at Gene McCarthy’s, pretty much what a hefe should be IMO. Standard banana & clove, touch of lemon. possibly mouthfeel is a tad lighter. Iverall a solid well made hefe

Appearance: Slightly cloudy gold with thick, white head. Taste: Medium sweetness, straight through. Palate: Medium body, soft carbonation, slick texture, soft finish. Overall: Meh...it’s a decent beer, but not mind blowing.
Buckeye Wheat Cloud;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buckeye Brewing Company;on tap at Beer Engine 28Sept2012, spritzy is the best way I think of this beer, its bubbly and light compared to most other hefe’s. easily drinkable is right, but leaves more to be desired.
Buckeye Wheat Cloud;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buckeye Brewing Company;Big clove and spice aroma, pours a clear light amber with a full white head that quickly fades. The flavor is there with the clove and spice, very little banana is present, with the banana coming out mainly in the finish. Full bodied, with a lingering spice finish. This is an easy drinking beer for a hot summer night.
Buckeye Wheat Cloud;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buckeye Brewing Company;Poured on draft. Pours a mostly clear gold color with just a thin whit puff of a head. Aroma is all cloves and wheat. Taste is a touch sweet with some esters coming through. Finish is a little bit bitter, but mostly clove comes through. Nice hefe, but seems to be lacking some banana.
Buckeye Wheat Cloud;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Buckeye Brewing Company;22oz bottle (blue label), no idea how old it is... But it’s probably not fresh. Mildly hazy golden color. Virtually no head. Impressively, still a solid hefe aroma. Banana, vanilla, wheat aromas. Slightly tart sweet taste. Smooth, crisp lighter carbonation, dry finish. Pretty respectable hefeweizen. Still certainly good to drink, however old it may be.
Buckeye Vanilla Bean Porter;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Porter;Buckeye Brewing Company;Over carbonated, when poured into my shaker glass it was 3/4 filled with tan foam.

Buckeye Vanilla Bean Porter;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Porter;Buckeye Brewing Company;"12 oz bottle, snifter. Large, creamy, light brown head is somewhate quickly diminishing. Deep ruby-black body. Cookie, caramel, grain, roasted malt (H); plum, cola, vanilla, pepper aromas. Moderately sweet, lightly acidic flavor becomes a lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter finish. Typical sour/tangy porter finish. Medium body, watery/oily texture, average carbonation, chalky feel. The bottom line is: aroma could be stronger, vanilla is lost in the porter’s tangyness, chalky mouthfeel."
Buckeye Vanilla Bean Porter;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Porter;Buckeye Brewing Company;Thank You to Drew for sending me this Buckeye. Holly Cow! This beer is So carbonated! A massive hiss when it was uncapped and pours a gigantic kaki head. The flavor brings rogue notes of coffee, chocolate malt, but only vanilla in the finish.. Rather dry and tangy. The mouthfeel, actually the body in general, is too carbonated. It’s simply explosive as it hits the palate…. Carbonation is good, but explosive is scary~
Buckeye Vanilla Bean Porter;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Porter;Buckeye Brewing Company;The first vanilla beer I've had. Richly opaque with a foamy tan head. Aroma is subtly roasted with a nice vanilla presence. Body starts with a mild candy vanilla sweetness and transitions to finishing roasted and semi-dry. Goes down smooth and has a nice balance of flavor. Thanks Drew!

Buckeye Vanilla Bean Porter;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Porter;Buckeye Brewing Company;A fine beer from a local brewer! THICK and black (alomst chunky). Virtually no head.

Roasted malt, vanilla & caster sugar in the aroma. Light to Medium-bodied; Decent roasted malt tastee with some sweet characteristics finishing with a metallic twang.

Buckeye Vanilla Bean Porter;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Porter;Buckeye Brewing Company;Dark brown black with a medium tan head which is darker around the rim of hte glass.

Buckeye Vanilla Bean Porter;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Porter;Buckeye Brewing Company;Opaque beer with a thin tan head and an almost chalky nose. Very soft, oily mouthfeel. I didn't get a lot of vanilla out of it, but more of a bitter chocolate with a vague dusty metallic taste. This beer has very little complexity when chilled, but even at room temperature it disappointed me.

Olde Stone Wilde Old Ale;Peterborough, Ontario, Canada;Old Ale;Olde Stone Brewing;Others have described the flavour which is as they say good for a dark ale. Falls short as it’s overly carbonated leaving the palate foamy and dry. A good start for talented but amateur brewer.

Belle-Vue Kriek LA;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Belle-Vue (AB InBev);*Old rating, best before 26/08/07. Ein Blick auf die Zutatenliste verdirbt schon den Geschmack: 1,62% konzentrierter Kirschsaft, dann noch Zucker, Aromen, Farbstoffe und Süßstoff.

Belle-Vue Kriek LA;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Belle-Vue (AB InBev);Industrial low alcohol version of Belle-Vue Kriek, with thinner body but equally sweet syrupy and candyish cherry taste, even less relief from acidity, one-sided and boring. But there is an audience for this, and I must admit I had worse low alcohol beers than this.
Belle-Vue Kriek LA;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Belle-Vue (AB InBev);You know that syrup stuff you add water to to make it like a soft drink?

AleSmith Stumblin Monk;San Diego, California, United States;Tripel;AleSmith Brewing Company;750ml bottle - 1999 Vintage - Thanks to BelgianBeerGal for sharing this bottle! Pours a hazy golden color, with a white head. Smell is caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate, spices, and some yeast. Taste is caramel, chocolate, yeast, spices, and citrus. Light mouthfeel, and medium carbonation. I am very happy I got to try this super rare beer!
AleSmith Stumblin Monk;San Diego, California, United States;Tripel;AleSmith Brewing Company;1999 75cl bottle shared with the TX crew at Markus’. Really excited to try this bottle and it did not disappoint. Almost impossible to believe that this beer is over 10 years old now. The flavors (spice, citrus, clove, banana) are all still there but obviously muted a little. The alcohol level is still perfect. I desperately hope I age this well too. Peter, please brew something similar again!
AleSmith Stumblin Monk;San Diego, California, United States;Tripel;AleSmith Brewing Company;Cloudy orangish pour. Aroma of vanilla, caramel, some perfumey spices, yeast, coriander, and some fruity undertones. Flavor is loaded with spice, yeast, vanilla, and some interesting fruit/grain notes. Very very good. I feel very lucky to have tried this one!
AleSmith Stumblin Monk;San Diego, California, United States;Tripel;AleSmith Brewing Company;1999 vintage cork and capped bottle with much thanks to Matt and Amy (belgianbeergal)! Rating number 3800. Pours with a hazy golden body and a small but persistent white head. Aroma of mint, candi sugar, maderized oxidation, earthy, but decently dry. Taste is cotton candy, a dry mustiness, caramelized throughout, maderized wine, and a nice rich sweet breadiness. Mild corked presence. Creamy bubbles. Holding up surprisingly well despite its age and a fully wet cork!
AleSmith Stumblin Monk;San Diego, California, United States;Tripel;AleSmith Brewing Company;(750ml bottle vintage 1999 thanks to Belgianbeergal and her husband) pour clear orange that glows with a ring of white bubbles and oily texture apparent in the glass. Nose of candi sugar, sherry, musty, cellar, cork, brown sugar, and wet moss. Taste is spicy, cinnamon, brown sugar, caramel, very light alcohol, graham cracker, and chocolate> Decent oily/creamy carbonation considering the age. Really nice sweet/spicy balance. This has held up magnificently! There was definitely some oxidation here that was to be expected with the age, but it didn’t take away from it at all.

AleSmith Stumblin Monk;San Diego, California, United States;Tripel;AleSmith Brewing Company;Sampled at Dr. Bill’s ’09. Thanks Peter for bringing this. Pours a very pale, clear, light orange-gold with a thin, loose white head. Spicy aroma of grains of paradise, white pepper, some banana, and faint citrus peel. Flavor is delicate and very aged with very little sweetness, soft Belgian fermentation flavors, and more fruit and spice. The body is thin, as expected for a beer of this age, but still manages to completely hide the alcohol present. This was a very fun rare treat.
Saku Sack bei Reval;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);From the archives: this was an upgraded version of Saku on Ice. Nothing extraordinary, but it was beautifully presented.
Saku Sack bei Reval;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);330ml bottle. Golden amber color. Hop extract, grassy, caramel in aroma. Grassy, somewhat spicy and bit metallic in taste. Soft carbonation.
Saku Sack bei Reval;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);"Proof that ""premium lager"" equals dull, competent beer, regardless of country of origin. This Estonian lager poured a deep gold colour with a moderate head. Some hay and a hint of spice in the aroma. Bit of sweet malt and citrus in the middle but it pulls up very short indeed. (Bottle)"
Saku Sack bei Reval;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);The best thing about this beer is that you can say that you have tried an Estonian beer. It is better than the cuisine, which isn't saying much when one of their delicacies is milk soup. It is a bit too thin for my liking, perhaps even too much like a number of the Aussie beers that purport to be a premium. Yeah there is hersbrucker but it may have been put in too early in the boil to give it a really good aroma.
Saku Sack bei Reval;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);Very amber colour, Smell and taste may be of the vaunted hersbrucker hops or of some unknown malt or corn or anything really. Has alcohol in the finish which is unusual in a 5% beer
Saku Sack bei Reval;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);Tastes more like the sack the hersbrucker hops came in was used to add flavour to this Estonian lager. Not exactly the smoothest beer I've ever had. Not worth paying premium beer prices to get standard beer quality.
Saku Sack bei Reval;Saku, Harjumaa, Estonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saku Õlletehas (Carlsberg);Couldn't believe no-one rated this one. Pretty damn good for a Premium larger. Really quite smooth, full taste. I can't say I know what Hersbrucker aroma hops are like, but there is certainly an aromatic taste to it that I like and if it's good old Hersbrucker then I'll have some more.
Three Needs Hefeweizen;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Comes on cold and orange. Not overly cloudy. Thin mouthfeel. Mild flavors. Head fades quickly. Drinkable, certainly, but this one is below-average for this style.
Three Needs Hefeweizen;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Pours a clear orange golden with a thin white head. Aroma is very citrusy with some yeastiness. Body is tart and semi-sweet, with more acidity than I'm used to in a weizen. Has some hints of clove and banana, but is overpowered by citrus.
Three Needs Hefeweizen;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Weak, watery example of this type.

OK mouthfeel.
Sinpalsken Blond;Sint-Pauwels, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Cock;0.33L bottle. Purs clear straw with a frothy white head. Aromas are bubblegum, cooked vegetables, some anice. Flavor is medium sweet, with bubblegum and alochol coming through. Finishes with strong, herby hop finish that lingers and cancels out the sweetness. Light body with a thin mouthfeel and very active carbonation. Bottle actually exploded on me when I opened it. Overall, some interesting characters relataive to the standard blonde, but also some off aromas/flavors that make this not so great.
Sinpalsken Blond;Sint-Pauwels, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Cock;"Regional beer from Sint-Pauwels-based beer company De Cock, but made at Van Steenberge. Regular, moussy, yellowish white head, deep peach blond colour with orange hue, misty.

Sinpalsken Donker;Sint-Pauwels, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij De Cock;"One of the three Sinpalsken beers, the name of which refer to the village (Sint-Pauwels) where the brewer lives. Deep mahogany brown beer, thick and even somewhat rocky, off-white head; caramelly malt character, a bit resinous, somewhat undercarbonated (like the blonde one), dried fruits, sourish touch, a bit metallic (clear iron in the nose as well, most likely from head stabilizing agents), supple mouthfeel with malty and nutty finish with simple, gentle, leafy hop bitterishness in the end.

Grainy and malty aroma, a bit unpleasant and industrial. Flavor is...empty, there are some malty notes here and that’s it. Very watery and thin body leads to no finish, or just some hints of hops. This is even worse than Pils original! Nothing too much unpleasant that it wouldn’t be drinkable, only dull.

Not sure how different this one is from the Union Pivo (not having had that one in awhile) but it definitely is from the Pils Original. Poured a golden body with a small head that went away fast. Slightly skunky nose with some veggies and some graininess. The taste is mostly dusty hopiness with some very light lemon amd some boring corny maltiness and very light flowery notes. Very light cardboard. Kinda drinkable but highly unimpressive.

This is a pretty big hopped up pale ale, could use a little stronger malt background (couldn’t they all) but overall it is pretty substantial and balances out the large amount of grapefruity and citrus hops that bitter out through the entire pint. I would love to have this again.
Full Sail Hopocity;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Enjoyed 2004 @ Full Sail tasting room in Hood River, Oregon--Poured a light copper body with a fluffy one-finger head. Grassy, fruity, and pretty darn biting on the palate. Not a lot of malt flavor comes out in this hop monster. It is more hops than anything (hence the name). This is one tasty (though unbalanced) springtime brew.
Full Sail Hopocity;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Pours a nice golden orange. Aromas of hops and citrus. Nice mellow hop citrus flavor. With a name like Hopocity, I thought or rather expected a more hop bite.
Full Sail Hopocity;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Full Sail Brewing Company;On tap. Poured a light copper color with an ever-lasting thin white head. A decent bouquet of citrusy hops and some grassy notes. The taste was very hoppy, not balanced at all. This was, however a rather drinkable beer amd what malt flavor there was must have been hidden under a steep amount of Amarillo hops. Pretty full mouth feel.
Full Sail Hopocity;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Full Sail Brewing Company;"Dark bronze with a fluffy white head and stringy lacing. Blend of citrus hops with some notes of soap in the nose. Floral and bitter. Balanced out well with a nice backing of malts. Bitter comes out more in the flavor along with citrus; mostly lemons and orange. Smooth hoppy tail that I love. Hops and malts blend very well."
Full Sail Hopocity;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Full Sail Brewing Company;This beer smells better than it tastes, unfortunately. It has a very strong citrusy aroma, but the taste is a bit too sharp for my taste. Not enough balance in the flavor to keep me interested. It was a decent beer, but for the money I know I can do better.
Full Sail Hopocity;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Full Sail Brewing Company;"From the bottle Pours golden amber with a fluffy white head. Classic grapefruit and pine aroma; the taste is a lovely blend of hops and subdued warm grain malt, with a long finish that draws more and more bitter as it plays out. The mouthfeel is perhaps a slgiht bit thin and a bit overcarbonated, but quite nice still. This is a smooth drinking bitter ale, an ESB with a Pacific Northwest twist. It doesn’t have the in-your-face kick of a hard-edged IPA, but it is more than bitter enough and more than hoppy enough to make a very fine sesion beer for hop lovers. I’m very impressed!"
Full Sail Hopocity;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Clear golden appearance, moderate head formation. Mild lemony aroma. Hoppy palate, fairly bitter with sweet lemon and mild ginger running through. Decent bite in the finish.
Full Sail Hopocity;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Yes it’s hoppy but there is some earthiness to accompany it. The citrus flavors are there and it is pretty bitter but the balance is nice. Good beer.

Grans Evig Sommer;Sandefjord, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grans Bryggeri;Can, I rate this? Pours pale golden with a big fast diminishing white head. Aroma is skunky lightstruck with wet cardboard playing in the background, what a mess, promising. Taste is sweet with a metallic oriented theme, no real HM, more anonymous and shy. Not ready to play with the big boys, thats for sure. Rubbish, utterly rubbish.
Sierra Blanca Pilsner;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Draft at the pub at ABQ. Pours a clear, yellow color with little to no head. Hardly anything in the aroma. Light, crisp taste. Grass notes. Very smooth and easy to drink. Not a bad brew. Something you would drink on a nice, spring day.
Sierra Blanca Pilsner;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Pilsners don’t tend to be the most complex beers around, and Rio Grande Desert Pilsner doesn’t deviate from that paradigm. It is a nice, refreshing beer with a pretty good taste, and would certainly be a beer that you could put a few back sitting under the hot sun in New Mexico. It would also be a good beer to give macro lager fans to try and expand their horizons a bit.
Sierra Blanca Pilsner;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;On tap at the ABQ brewpub. Pours a clear yellow with a very small white head.

Sierra Blanca Pilsner;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Pours a light yellow with almost no head, and what there is dissipates quickly. Smells mostly of hops and malt, slightly of bread. The taste is bitter and bready, but refreshing. Perfect carbonation for this style. I’d drink this again.

Sierra Blanca Pilsner;Moriarty, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sierra Blanca Brewing Company;Pours a pale gold with a respectable, glass-coating white head. Aroma is sweet pale malt and grass. The taste marks this one as an excellent pilsener. Crisp, clean, refreshing taste of malt sweetness along with a hop flavor and bitterness which is very obvious but not overdone. Great effort. I’d put it up there with Victory as an excellent domestic pils.

Pours clear golden with a quickly diminishing white head. The aroma has lots of pils malt, light diacetyl notes and a hint of spicy hops. Medium / thin body that’s more lush than most pils and has some semi-sharp carbonation. The flavor begins with pils malt that’s fairly rich along with some spiced hops and bits of grass. The finish shows some oxidation and more spicy hops. This seems like an aged decent pils. Hopefully I get to try this fresh at some point and give a rerate.

Yixing;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Redruth;Yery Malty Flavour, and a very distinctive taste - possibly caused by the rice?. Bottle tasted was salvaged from the remains of the brewery and is 8 years past its Expiry Date...
Yixing;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Redruth;Aromas of malt soon overtaken by an all pervading smell of cow dung. Hints of passion fruit in the mouth along with malt and more cow with a rough adjuncty finish.
Redruth Steam Brewed Lager;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Redruth;Nothing wrong with the colour - bright gold. The aroma manages to be grassy and farmyardy at the same time, leading me to the rather unlikely conclusion that it smells of silage. The flavour is nondescript, but inoffensive, with some sharp bite, but underlying sweetness and a tinny tang on the finish. I wasn't expecting too much, but thought I should try this while I still had the chance as the company went into administration in January and the brewery has now been closed. Perhaps I should have hung on to this as an investment. The administrators are still looking for buyers, but this could be the final chapter in the history of the once mighty Devenish empire (the Weymouth brewery having closed some years ago) - an everyday tale of corporate greed, asset stripping and bad beer. 500ml (not bottle conditioned) bottle from beersofeurope.co.uk

Redruth Steam Brewed Lager;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Redruth;Was fearful that the previously rated yixing lager was merely this beer in disguise, but this had a nice grassy hop aroma with a balancing maltiness in the mouth that followed through into the finish.

Bert Grant's Lazy Days Pale Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;Bottle, Hmm retired well thats good to know, that could explain the complete lack of hops. Tasted kind of sweet, with little aroma of hops and no bitterness. Pretty watery and boring. Oh well its retired.
Bert Grant's Lazy Days Pale Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;Well... I might have been a little more careful if I knew that this beer was retired. Additionally, I bought it from the exact same shop that Cornfield did about a year ago. Yeesh. Somebody needs to rotate their stock... Anyway, this one pours a bright copper body with plenty of carbonation under a short-lived, off-white head. Caramel and biscuit aroma comes across as sweet baked goods. A bit of oxidation in the flavor (go figure) but it finds a decent balance starting with those sweet malts and finishing with a mild dose of bitterness. I’m actually not as disappointed as I thought I’d be. Single 12 oz. bottle from T-Birds, Plainfield, IL 60544
Bert Grant's Lazy Days Pale Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;The body is a clear, bright copper color with a slender white head that quickly becomes a ring around the glass.

Amber-copper with a brass shine to it. Vigorous pour barely produces a head. A bit of white bubbles fizzle away quickly. Smells like butter, popcorn, fresh floral hopped wort and caramel malt. Wow this sure dosent smell anything like simcoe to me. Just leafy, dry and lightly earthy. Medium-sized bubbles arise, but the body is clear and filtered. Flavor is light, leafy, buttery, sweet malt. Very bready. Fake carbonation. Waxy, big, bubbly mouthfeel. Yuck. Another lame ""hoppy"" summer ale. Watery. 4 months old and a low gravity summer ale. If they don’t want to get crap reviews of their product, all it takes is a call to remove any remaining bottles from the shelves and have them sent back to the brewery. I have a feeling Bert Grant would not be too happy with this garbage were he still alive."
Chiltern Beechwood Bitter;Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chiltern Brewery;"""Bright"" beer bought fresh from the brewery, where, interestingly, they didn't seem to know what I meant when I asked for ""bright"" beer. I'm someone who travels long distances in search of obscure breweries, and I'm attracted to countryside breweries and hoppy bitters. So I'm drinking this ""Beechwood Bitter"" right now with some doubts about the product knowledge and expertise of the people who sold it to me. The people at the counter in a brewery shop should, very definitely, be more than aware of the key terminology in the craft, such as the word ""bright"". I won't move on this - there are no excuses for product ignorance. Chilterns Brewery is a stone's throw away (if you're very strong) from Tring Brewery, and it just isn't as good. The brewery shop was a little contrived and pretentious, and the prices of the products, including this beer, tend to be about a third higher per litre than comparable beers from other local ""craft"" ale brewers. The clientele and the staff at this brewery didn't seem to be the 'real ale' crowd of afficionados, such as you find at Rebellion Brewery and Tring Brewery. Rather, they seemed to be slightly awkward 'let's try to run a farm shop this year' types. So, admittedly, I opened the bottle with some misgivings. That said, I chose Beechwood Bitter because it's exactly my type of beer. It's not bad at all - good hoppy character and tone, but it is a bit lacey. Although I won't be buying this again or revisiting, it's only because far better real ale offerings are around in the local area, for those in the know. Otherwise, it really isn't bad at all. It just isn't *great*. Nice effort I suppose."

Pours dark amber with small beige head with sufficient retention. ""Warm"" malty, nutty aroma reflected in the taste, where also a little hop bitterness to contrast the caramel, bisquit and nutty flavours kicks in. This bitterness also carries over in to the aftertaste where it gradually takes over from the inherent sweetnes.Good mouthfeel and easily drinkable. I like more hops in my beer but this is definitely classic British bitter and well balanced."
Chiltern Beechwood Bitter;Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chiltern Brewery;Bought @ The Brewery, Take Home 2pt Pack. Dark ruby colour, full body with toffee like sweetness, low carbonation, no head. Pleasant beer.
Chiltern Beechwood Bitter;Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chiltern Brewery;Amber bodied with stable small beige head. Maltier bade than I expected, caramel and biscuit, with fresh hops, quite piney for a classic English bitter. Creamy mouth feel, not too thin for the abv. Great drinkability and properly bitter. Hooray! Rightfully recommended to me by the friendly bartender at The Royal Standard of England. I happily pass that recommendation.

Chiltern Beechwood Bitter;Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chiltern Brewery;From cask. Pours cloudy orange with a small tan head. Aroma is toasted malty, light fruity. Bitter, toasted malty and breadish. Bitter and dry, light herbal hoppy.
Chiltern Golden Sovereign;Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chiltern Brewery;Cask at Merton Beer Festival Sept’ 2004. Warm yellow colour, without any head. Somewhat lacking in the flavour Department, a little bit dry not much bitterness, but I suppose could be regarded as quite refreshing. Not bad but nothing special.
Chiltern Golden Sovereign;Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chiltern Brewery;Cask Conditioned at Merton Beer Festival ’04. Deep Gold with no head. I was really looking forward to this beer as Chiltern Beers are so hard to find, but it was a dissapointment. It is a thin dry bitter with a malty background. Tealeaf notes dominate the bulk of the beer which leaves barely any impression of having drunk it.
Chiltern Golden Sovereign;Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Chiltern Brewery;"A pretty unsatisfying beer, although understandable within the ""mild"" tradition of English brewing. Typical color, scarce bubbles on top, but a better feel in the mouth than would be predicted by 3.7%. The taste, however, is disappointing: rather like American iced tea made from Lipton-brand tea-bags. (on tap at the brewery)"
Millennium Starköl 5.1%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Sverige;"Aroma; something went wrong at the paper factory. Look; off white head and clear golden body. Taste; malted cardboard industry and cooked vegetables with glue notes. Finishes in the drain. Feel; thin n ugly. Overall; leftovers from paper industry. The appearance was normal though."

Millennium Starköl 5.1%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Sverige;Burk 500 ml från Systembolaget. Blekt gul och ganska lite skum. Doft av bröd. Smak av malt och bröd, och med en syrlig frisk smak. Liten beska och ganska mycket kolsyra. Detta är en av de billigaste ölen man kan köpa på Systembolaget (22 kr/litern) och det förstår man när man dricker den.

Wild Duck Sasquatch Strong Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wild Duck Brewery;KLCC Microbrewfest ’09: Dark amber pour with a rich aroma of malty sweetness, citrus, and caramel.

Wild Duck Sasquatch Strong Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wild Duck Brewery;I had this beer in 2004 at HorseBrass Pub, Portland. Don held a special Glen Ale Release Party / Fund Raiser for the Glen Foundation. It was a Vintage 2002 keg of Sassy. Said to have been the last one in existance!!! It was an honour just to be there.
Wild Duck Sasquatch Strong Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wild Duck Brewery;Decent, super-malty dried fruit tasting strong ale. Reminded me of Arrogant bastard without all the hops.
Wild Duck Sasquatch Strong Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wild Duck Brewery;"Dark brown and clear. Strong fruit-cereal aroma, like ""Trix"" or ""Froot Loops""... which is honestly what came to mind when I smelled this one. Big on the malts, with flavors of cherries, plums and wood, and presents itself like a ""mild"" barley wine. Very dry finish."
Wild Duck Sasquatch Strong Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wild Duck Brewery;A powerful ale, the 7.5% sneaks up on you, well actually its not too sneaky, its just kind of there, you know what I mean, quit being a jerk.
Wild Duck Sasquatch Strong Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wild Duck Brewery;Medium red gold in color. Only a medium malt flavor, and in my opinion, way to hoppy for a strong ale (at least I perceive a Strong Ale should be sweet and malty, with a more mild hop profile). If you removed the Strong Ale categorization from this beer, it would be an average American Pale Ale with some darker malts added for color.
Wild Duck Sasquatch Strong Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wild Duck Brewery;Dark Copper color. Medium head. Aroma is malty. A medium bodied strong ale. Malts are caramely, touch or orange and slightly sweet. Hops are slightly spicy and finishes rather dry, A touch of an alcohol bite at 7.5 %. Very flavorful. Well balanced. There is a touch of alcohol oiliness at 7.5%. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Wild Duck Sasquatch Strong Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wild Duck Brewery;Dark amber body, thin dense creamy tan head. Dried fruits and spices. some ripe fruits and a subdued floral tone. Alcohol among sweet malts with a very bitter roof of the mouth. Cleans up quickly and well. Smooth mouthfeel initially. Good balance and decent complexity.
Wild Duck Sasquatch Strong Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wild Duck Brewery;On tap at the 2003 Great Alaska Beer and Barley Wine Festival. Deep orange color with foamy off-white head and a warm, hoppy nose. Very smooth out of the keg with a strong hop bitterness and maybe not strong enough on the malts. Reminded me more of a good Northwest IPA.
Magic Hat Lemon-Ginger Hocus Pocus;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Draught at the Sunset Grill in Allston. Creamy, with weizen-like wha flavors and ginger. The ginger flavor is light but noticeable. Decent and drinkable but bland.
Magic Hat Lemon-Ginger Hocus Pocus;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This one tasted like off-beer. The ginger was astringent and over-done. Hocus Pocus normale does not nearly have the backbone for this infusion.
Magic Hat Lemon-Ginger Hocus Pocus;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pretty odd. I don't care much for ginger in beer, except for Hitachino White, and this didn't do much to change my mind. The lemon and ginger go surprisingly well together, (I'm not a food expert by any means) I wouldn't put them together, but i really didn't enjoy this beer to give it a terribly great rating. I do appreciate the 22oz bomber bottle revival, though.
Magic Hat Lemon-Ginger Hocus Pocus;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Lighter than the normal hocus. Interesting though. Lemon and ginger flavors are obvious. A refreshing summer brew. Somehow this brew evades the whole wheatness of hocus pocus and is simply a spiced brew. Yet it is invigourating.
Magic Hat Lemon-Ginger Hocus Pocus;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Bomber-sized bottle. Slightly hazy light amber hue, with foamy lasting head. Nose is certainly lemon-gingery up-front; stronger on the pungent spice than the fruit. Interesting, but not very beer-like to me. Flavor is also more fruity-spicy than wheat-beer-like, though a bit of malt does come through toward the end. Pretty thinnish body. I wanted to like this, as I've been liking Magic Hat overall more this year, but can't really recommend it. Can't imagine what the garlic-flavored one was like."

Websters Yorkshire Bitter;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);2L brown plastic bottle sampled many years ago poured a dusty light brown color with a huge white head that retained well and left a few spots of lacing as it settled. Aroma was nutty and earthy with some toasted grains. Taste is an earthy hop bitterness with a nutty butter flavor and a toasted malty sweetness. Light bodied and was surprisingly tasty despite its low ABV. A little bit musty for my tastes, may have been an old bottle.
Websters Yorkshire Bitter;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);09.02.2008. 0,5l Can. Golden colour. Weak aroma with almost no hopping. No aftertaste. A little dissapointing.

Websters Yorkshire Bitter;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);Clear amber coloured beer with small white head and lots of carbonation. Medium palate. Finish is herby ending bitter and slightly dry, a soft ending.
Websters Yorkshire Bitter;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);Searles, Hunstanton. Thin nutty malt aroma. Biscuit, vanilla, chalk and vegetable water. Heavily diluted gravy, varnishy bitterness. Pretty awful, but bearable. Makes total sense it’s brewed by John Smith’s.
Websters Yorkshire Bitter;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);Can. Chestnut colouring, off-white whipped cream head. Neutral, light nutty aroma. Metallic roasted base flavor - shavings off a rusty nail in water, light bitter finish. Thin mouthfeel, metallic on the roof of the mouth. Watery finish.
Websters Yorkshire Bitter;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);Draught at Cheshunt Rugby Club. It was served very cold, but still had some flavour - a tea-ishness with hints of citrus. Any hoppiness that may have been there was frozen out and the serving temp. also killed off the finish. However I enjoyed it - it was a most refreshing post-match pint.
Websters Yorkshire Bitter;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);Tinned, pasteurised. Brown amber, a little murky, carbonated but short lasting head. All that was available at a party, so had several, largely tasteless, maybe some boiled malt and sticky sugary caramel notes, otherwise just dull and boring. Drank to be sociable.
Websters Yorkshire Bitter;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);Can. Deep brown body under a creamy, white head. Malty aroma. Taste like watered flavoured caramel. A bit smoky impression. Can’t find the bitterness. Insipid (02.02.2007)
Websters Yorkshire Bitter;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);"A Mes rate: Half from the wonderful (not at all) Cherry Orchard in Newington. Had this listening to the local ""talent"" slaughter Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd. It has to be said the beer matched up to the quality of the music. So watery I could have put a goldfish in there and it wouldn’t have died. Nothing in the nose or flavour. The only thing of note was a slight bitterness to the finish. Yum!"
Mystic Ultimate Pale Ale;Temple, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mystic Brew Pub & Restaurant;Too carbonated, you could defnitely feel all the bubbles and what not on your tongue, just couldn't taste all the flavors and what not because of the over-carbonation, of what I did taste of this brew, it did have pretty good balance, the color seemed a little too light for a pale ale, kept a nice head, a little citrusy flavors, spicy bitter & dry aftertaste, would have been much better without the extra carbonation.
Mystic Fiesenbrau Cream Ale;Temple, Pennsylvania, United States;Cream Ale;Mystic Brew Pub & Restaurant;Very true to the cream ale style. Light, good lawnmower brew that you could drink all day.
Mystic Fiesenbrau Cream Ale;Temple, Pennsylvania, United States;Cream Ale;Mystic Brew Pub & Restaurant;Very light bodied, kept a nice head, did have friuty undertones with a little bit of a spicy aftertaste, pretty decent cream ale
Mystic Ruby Extra Special Bitter;Temple, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mystic Brew Pub & Restaurant;Again, too carbonated like most of the rest of Mystic's brews when I tasted them, kept a very nice creamy lacy head throughout the pint, very smooth, nicely balanced, bitter aftertaste, decent ESB
Mystic Reserve Brown Ale;Temple, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Mystic Brew Pub & Restaurant;More of malt taste than anything. I could taste some hops in the brew, looked better in the glass than it tasted.
Mystic Reserve Brown Ale;Temple, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Mystic Brew Pub & Restaurant;Not a great head at all, again overly-carbonated, had the bity carbonated taste sitting on the tongue that I think blocked many of the flavors that were truly in the beer, it was nicely balanced from what I could taste through the carbonation, not as sweet as many brown ales
Triumph American Lager;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Triumph Brewing Company;Clear gold cilor, light head. Tasting pour. Aroma is corn like. Taste is super light. A bit of a light sour. Clean finish. Not my thing.
Triumph American Lager;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Triumph Brewing Company;Draft this goes back. Pours a pale body with a white head. Bread y grain y cereal notes, simple thin with some corn y sweetness. okay.
Triumph American Lager;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Triumph Brewing Company;on tap in Princeton 7/21/2007. Although I don’t do so all of the time, I decided to score this beer on style. Clear golden in color with a moderate off white head. Aroma is sweet pale malt/grain and corn with very light foral hops notes. Taste is very light on the malt, with some cereal grains, light notes of pale malt and corn. Finishes lightly bitter. Even with the corn, this beer was light, clean, crisp and refreshing. Brewed flawlessy to style, way above any BMC pale lager that I have had. I would recommend this to the macro crowd and I have no doubt they would enjoy it a heck of alot more than what they are currently drinking.
Triumph American Lager;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Triumph Brewing Company;on tap-pours a white head with yellow color. Aroma is grain, secondary hops. Taste follows, good flat hops bite. OK carbonation.
Triumph American Lager;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Triumph Brewing Company;Tasted with the beer and cheese pairing. Admittedly this is not a favorite style for me, but I did enjoy it. I made the mistake of having a stout before the pairing and realized my senses were a bit off. The hops actually came through a bit more than expected, but again from a tainted palette. Residual sugars abound, corn chips, sweet finish. Not bad, but not inspiring
Triumph American Lager;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Triumph Brewing Company;Poured cloudy golden with a foamy white head. Aroma had corn and not much else. Rather simplistic taste but not unpleasant.
Triumph American Lager;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Triumph Brewing Company;"A pretty standard clean lager. A lot better than most of the stuff out there touting itself as ""American Lager"". It was poured with a fizzy head, golden in color. Pretty dry and clean in both flavor and finish. I had to say this one is pretty good."
Triumph American Lager;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Triumph Brewing Company;Very pale and clear, with a white head. Corny malt aroma. Crips corny malt flavor with some hops. More character than a macro, and well done.
Triumph American Lager;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Triumph Brewing Company;07.21.04 Princeton. Pale with webby head. Distinctive corn aroma and some cardboardy hops. Tastes like an American lager all right. At least Triumph has the decency to label this beer for what it is without trying to play it off as something special.
Triumph American Lager;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Triumph Brewing Company;Lightly malty nose wafts heavily above this light yellow brew. Tencious white head with excellent lacing. Light mouthfeel with a slightly slick characteristic. Malty throughout with a dusty character. A shot of honeyish sweetness peeks out at the finish. Bitterness is light and rides on the top of the entire tasting.
Triumph Cask Conditioned Pale Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Triumph Brewing Company;Tap on hand pull. Very mild. Light grain with just a hint if hops. Virtually no bitterness. Does seem rather English-style.
Triumph Cask Conditioned Pale Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Triumph Brewing Company;From tap. Pours hazy orange with a small white head. Fruity, grapefruity and peachy. Sweet impression. Fruity, light peachy. Medium bitter, slight dry and lasting mild hoppy finish.
Triumph Cask Conditioned Pale Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Triumph Brewing Company;On gap at the New Hope location. Sa e description as this but listed as 7.7%. On cask. Poured a medium golden color with a large sized head. Aromas and tastes of caramel and some citrus. Lighter breadiness.
Triumph Cask Conditioned Pale Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Triumph Brewing Company;Sampled at Princeton. Orange with a small head with a tangerine head. Tastes like an orange lollipop, undercarbonated. I remember why I don’t like brewpubs.
Triumph Cask Conditioned Pale Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Triumph Brewing Company;on tap-pours a creamy offwhite head that laces with slightly hazy gold color. Aroma is musty malt, a bit of biting hops. Taste follows. Balanced but very mild/plain. Carbonation, standard for cask-hand pump, mild.
Triumph Cask Conditioned Pale Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Triumph Brewing Company;"On tap in Princeton - Hand pump - Unfiltered, pours a bit cloudy. MIld english hop nose with a hint of malt. Caramel in mid-taste, followed by dry maltiness. Great beer for a warm day, heck any day... Earlier Rating: 12/30/2004 Total Score: 3.4 Noting this was an English pale ale, I had to keep myself from wandering to the typical profile of what I expect anything with ""pale ale"" to taste like. Definitely exhibits the qualities I expect from English hops, but that in itself limits me to the maximum rating I can give. Likely the byproduct of my American tastes, this one was a bit on the light side for my tastes. An exemplory version of an EPA, but not my favorite style."
Triumph Cask Conditioned Pale Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Triumph Brewing Company;Very interesting. I haven’t had the opportunity to try some of the stranger beers out there, and this is definitely one of them. Came with a very nice rocky white head with small bubbles and a smoothness similar to Guinness. Very smooth due to low carbonation and a very nice maltiness with a good deal of hoppiness. A bit more than a one-off, definitely would like to enjoy again.
Triumph Cask Conditioned Pale Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Triumph Brewing Company;On tap at Princeton BP. (Hand Pump) Clear light amber color with a small white head. Very mild aroma of biscuit malts and some hops. A bit of sourness in the nose as well. Flavor was again very mild malt and a touch of hop bitterness. Tasted somewhat stale and sour. Old keg?
Triumph Cask Conditioned Pale Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Triumph Brewing Company;Hand pump. Fine real ale. One of the first beers I have had at this temperature. It was fine and easy to drink throughout. A good mellow beer. Beautiful cascading from the hand pump.
Triumph Cask Conditioned Pale Ale;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - English;Triumph Brewing Company;Hand pump at Princeton. Golden and clear with a white head. Hoppy aroma. Malty and hoppy flavor. Finish is malty. Excellent pale ale. Nice beer. Enjoyable. Drinkable.
O'Hanlon's Organic Rye;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hanlon's Brewery;Reddish dark brown pour. Nose and taste is a little dry. Taste beer. Rated 4/24/03
O'Hanlon's Organic Rye;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hanlon's Brewery;The O’Hanlon’s Organic Rye seems to convey lemon and other citrus notes with a lightly lingering hop finish. Rye malts offer a slight twist to the style, and so the beer has a welcoming character. Not exciting but would revisit.
O'Hanlon's Organic Rye;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hanlon's Brewery;Bottle. Poured clear copper with a large off-white frothy head that diminished slowly with good lacing. Medium sweet malty aroma. Medium body with a sticky texture and soft carbonation. Well balanced flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Good brew.
O'Hanlon's Organic Rye;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hanlon's Brewery;"Pours an orangish-amber with a slight haze under an ecru head which depleted rather quickly. Considerably malted aroma with caramel, dry cereal grains and a hint of lemon. Sweetly malted in flavor as well, and as I glance at the ""best before"" date on my bottle (02 18 2004), I can only assume that its ""oregano flavor"" has simply gone the way of the buffalo. I think it held up rather well as a malty EPA. Single pint bottle from T-Birds, Plainfield, IL 60544"
O'Hanlon's Organic Rye;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hanlon's Brewery;"500ml. Pours a slightly hazy medium amber with a towering, bubbly off-white head that takes forever to make way for more beer poured into the glass. Slightly sweet caramel on the nose, along with a gentle whiff of the sourness of rye. Very understated. Slightly assertive attack; medium body, soft carb, flavors starting to roust themselves after their relative absence on the nose. More of the same mild caramel and rye, along with some toast. Almost free of finish. Ihave a soft spot for rye so I probably like this a bit more than it really merits, but it’s a nice clean endlessly sessionable bitter, and the world can always use a small step toward variety in that department."
O'Hanlon's Organic Rye;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hanlon's Brewery;"My bottle read ""Original Rye"" and was 5% ABV. Has an orangey amber color with an off white film for head. Slightly tart aroma, with some light fruity notes (pears) A bit thin and light. Crisp fruity notes of pears, like the aroma. Later hints of honeyish malt comes through with a very light flowery finish. Like with many English Ales it’s highly drinkable and solid, but isn’t distinct in anyway."
O'Hanlon's Organic Rye;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hanlon's Brewery;amber color. Smell of hop, yeast, minor citrus, Asti Champagne, malt and spice. Taste of hops, sugar, bitters, spice, smoked rye and a nice bitterness at the end. Can also taste some citrus but not a lot.
O'Hanlon's Organic Rye;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hanlon's Brewery;Good carbonation gave this beer a fine mouthfeel. Lightly breaded flavor flirting with floral notes and just a hint of vanilla made this a pleasant beer, while its overly watery flavor kept it from being a truly good one. Good with food, but I’ll stick to the darks.
O'Hanlon's Organic Rye;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hanlon's Brewery;This had a decent head.aroma was quite fragrant of hops.color amber.lots of flavor.will buy again.
O'Hanlon's Organic Rye;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hanlon's Brewery;I was pleasantly surprised by this one. It poured with a great white head and a cloudy dark yellow/brown appearance. Smelled a bit like a heffe and looked like one too. Flavor was similar, as well, with some citrus tones present. A touch more sour than your typical heffe, but this one was very enjoyable. Who needs barley?

Carolina Beer Co. Blonde;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Carolina Beer Company;クリームエール ハチミツのような香り 飲みやすい
Carolina Beer Co. Blonde;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Carolina Beer Company;It has a pale straw yellow color with good clarity and visible carbonation. The head is thin, bright white and foamy. It quickly fades leaving little to no lace behind. The aroma is mild and has hints of light malty grains and husky notes. The flavor is simple crisp and clean. Light malty grains give it a slightly sweet character with a touch of citrus and leafy/herbal hops. Its light body, fairly thin texture and crisp finish make it easy to drink
Carolina Beer Co. Blonde;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Carolina Beer Company;[on tap in CLT airport] Sweet base malt and hay aroma with some faint lagery sulfur and young popcorn notes. Crystal clear straw under a short-lived white cover that clings to the glass. Weak flavour of hay and sweet pilsner-style malt that lets through some ethanol tang. Noble hops presence in the background. Light body and watery, with medium carbonation, and a faintly tart finish.
Carolina Beer Co. Blonde;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Carolina Beer Company;I remember this one, and I remember its many iterations, including the plastic 16oz bottle. Before many good beers came to NC, I bought this at the beach on occasion. Better than shitty macro, but still a bit sweet and corny. Slightly metallic.
Carolina Beer Co. Blonde;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Bubblely with refreshing taste, and clean finish. Very light. Good beer for a hot day.
Carolina Beer Co. Blonde;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Originally reviewed: 7/24/08. [This is the old pre-Foothills-takeover version]. Pours a murky golden color with a very small head. I poured this the same as I always do, and I got nothin’. Smells of sweet honey, fruit, and buttery biscuits. Some floral. Taste is clean and crisp. Very light-bodied. Not a ton of flavor going on, maybe some slight biscuity malt. Very smooth and well-balanced. Extremely easy to consume. This beer is not complex at all. Though it is very refreshing and pairs well with bbq or just after mowing the lawn.
Carolina Beer Co. Blonde;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Originally rated December 2004. My parents brought me back a 6-pack of this brew from the States. Poured a pale yellow colour with a white foamy head that left a good amount of lacing. The aroma I got was mostly grainy (right after the pour - and not much after that). The taste was mildly of malts and grasses. The aftertaste that kicked in after a while was rather sweet-tangy.

Olde Heidelberg House Draft;Heidelberg, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olde Heidelberg Restaurant and Brewery;On tap from the Olde Heidelberg Inn. Pours a deep golden with moderate carbonation and a small pure white head. Aroma is very light, with small cereal and floral notes. Flavour is quite grainy with a little bit of cooked veggie and some sweetness. Reminds me a lot of Warsteiner Premium Verum. A step up from a North American Macro and better than most house beers, but still pretty bland.
Olde Heidelberg House Draft;Heidelberg, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olde Heidelberg Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the Olde Heidelberg- This pale lager, now brewed at Brick Brewing Company, using the same Olde Heidelberg recipe from yesteryear, is simply a replacement for the macros with a homebrewed twist, according to the server. This lager tapped golden liquid under a frothy, but short lived white foam. Grainy, sugary, pale malt nose took some time to discern as this was served ice cold. Sweet grainy flavours with a slight floral component from the mild hopping. The finish is, again, grainy with some sweetness and an almost sour flavour comes through right at the end. Just a step above blue or the likes.
Olde Heidelberg House Draft;Heidelberg, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olde Heidelberg Restaurant and Brewery;"I had 3 of these today (one I inhaled) as it was hot and I was on the bike cruising the “minni-country” boondocks all day. The waiter (a dead ringer for the geek in the 50s Black label ads) called it ""House amber dry"". Amber it was not (more a dark gold) but dry it was… and refreshing under the circumstances. Definitely a light Canadian draft lager. It was marginally superior to the OV or Blue they usually pump out at these retro country draft houses. They serve this stuff fairly cold, which helps cover the rough edges of its short lagering period. Taps a darker gold with a 2cm cap that reduces to a small white ring ...aroma is subdued grainy, musty,… lots of sparkle to the palate, mild malt body and a dry finish with some kind of (Oaks just about nailed it) ""funky"" after taste. A better than average Canuck draft for the type of place/time/ it represents....a local landmark roadhouse that slings trays full of cold draft to blue collar patrons. With the exception of the picture window brew kettles, the place hasn’t changed since my parents took me here as a kid for pigtail n’ kraut dinners and they say it hasn’t changed a lot since they went there in the 60s."
Olde Heidelberg House Draft;Heidelberg, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olde Heidelberg Restaurant and Brewery;"I went here on Saturday. The Restaurant is odd its 1970s meets 1980s meets 1990s and stops there with tiny German bits here and there. I walk in and find quickly this is a place where I have to seat myself. You can see the copper vats through the window as you walk in through the door. Once inside your greeted with that typical dark wood stain of the late 1970 early 80s. I walk straight ahead through to the next section. There is a shuffle board table and some old people eating. Through to the next section is the bar and everyone stops and looks at me like I was from Mars. Looks up then goes back to talking again. I turn around and decide that the bar isn't were I want to be so I go back to the front section and sit down. They have two people severing you one from the bar and one from the kitchen. The first girl from the bar comes over and asks me what I want and I tell her I want their own beer which she called the ""homebrew"" Then I ordered a sausage on a kiaser which went well with the beer. Well anyways the beer wasn't much to be desired. Sweet smelling aroma gold colour with no head. Typical but not your typical Molson Canadian or Labatt Blue swill fuller then that. Malty sweet. Nothing special."
Olde Heidelberg House Draft;Heidelberg, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olde Heidelberg Restaurant and Brewery;Deep gold,thin fast fading head.Small bead. Just your normal mainstream lager.Nothing special
Olde Heidelberg House Draft;Heidelberg, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olde Heidelberg Restaurant and Brewery;You would think that a brewery only brewing one beer would try to brew something better. Very typical American standard, perhaps a little fuller bodied than most. Flavours were grainy and I suspect adjuncts were used in the brewing process.
Olde Heidelberg House Draft;Heidelberg, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olde Heidelberg Restaurant and Brewery;So, I'm driving through mennonite country, horse and buggy and everything (including that familiar country smell of freshly spread manour), when I came upon a brew pub. I walk in and I get a pint of their only beer, which is a lager of course, and I sit down beside an old man. He tells me of his life and about his journey to Canada stowed away on the Queen Mary and something about sandwiches and beer. Anyway, to make a long story short, typical fizzy golden lager, not so typical old school location.
Olde Heidelberg House Draft;Heidelberg, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Olde Heidelberg Restaurant and Brewery;A little bit grainy, funky. Maybe fuller bodied than the macros, but not that much different.

Titletown Dousman Street Wheat;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Titletown Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub. Semi-hazy yellow pour with a clingy white head. Light fruit and spice on the nose. Smooth palate. Citrus, wheat, and clove on taste. Decent stuff.
Titletown Dousman Street Wheat;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Titletown Brewing Company;A little too much for me in terms of balance. Lots of banana, clove, bubble gum and touch of coriander. Meh.
Titletown Dousman Street Wheat;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Titletown Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub, pours a hazy pale yellow. Aromas of bananas and weakness. Taste was a bit too corny, drowned out any other flavors. More like an American wheat than a German Hefe. Not their best offering.

Old Musketeer;Boezinge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Het Sas;"From the archives (around 2002). Clear amber color, frothy off-white head; roasted malt aroma, dark fruit, caramel, cloves; medium sweet, light bitterness, bit spicy; sweetbitter aftertaste"
Old Musketeer;Boezinge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Het Sas;(Bottle 25 cl) Brown with a shade of grey, nice, off-white head. Yummy roasted malt in both aroma and flavour, some spicy sweetness - almost trappist-like - with a good bite of hops to add balance. A nice full-bodied beer in spite of the low alcohol - for a Belgian ale that is. 131098
Old Musketeer;Boezinge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Het Sas;"Orange-amber colour, creamy head, fine perlage. Very nice and strong aroma, malt, hop; fruity; caramel, similar to barley wines!

Bitter End Aberdeen Amber Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Murky, light copper color with good head and lacing. Light malt aroma with some bready notes. Very balanced and clean malt flavor with a hint of bitterness at the end. Nice drinkable beer.
Bitter End Aberdeen Amber Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Had on tap at the Bitter End in Austin. Light copper appearance, thin, light white head, dissipates quickly. No real aroma, perhaps a bit of fresh lake water scent. muted nutty notes are the dominant flavor with a very, slight piney citrusy coming through in the back end. Overall, quite bland though. Mouthfeel is fair enough, finishes just a tad metallic however. Had much better from Bitter End.
Bitter End Aberdeen Amber Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Clear Garnet, good head. Some dry hops with a touch of coconut. Decent malt and good dryness. Not as aggresively hoppy as I would like.
Bitter End Aberdeen Amber Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Hoppy smell, amber color, weak head. Not too bad overall, sweet, a bit off balance, and something of a bad aftertaste (though not nearly as bad as their pale or lager).
Hops and Barley Brewing Cranberry Cream;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hops and Barley Brewing Co.;Chunky amber color with mountains of chunks circling the bottom of the glass like flesh eating sharks anticipating my next move...Flavor very similiar to cream soda and in actuality I might have a hard time telling the two apart, it would be interesting to know what the ABV is because it can't be too high at all

Salm-Bräu Helles;Wien, Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Salm-Bräu;"getrunken im Sommer 2016 Wenn man im google ""Bier+Wien+Touristenabzocke"" eingibt, kommt man schnell auf die Seit des Salm Bräus. Dies ist gleich neben dem Garten des weltbekannten Schloss Belvedere in Wien und dementsprechend besteht das Publikum großteils aus Touristen. Und dementsprechend auch die Preise... Aber gegen das BIer kann ich nichts vorbringen: Das Helle ist ein fein gehopftes, nicht sehr bitteres naturtrübes Bier, das sich sehr angenehm trinken lässt. Eine deutliche Malzsüße erzeugt eine hohe Süffigkeit. Wer sich von dem hofbräu-artigen Ambiente des Lokals nicht abschrecken lässt, sollte es unbedingt probieren."

Greene King Light Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Draught (Champion of the Thames, Cambridge) (6:4:5:2:10=2.7) Sweet malty aroma, some Greene King sulfury aspects, but nice.

Greene King Light Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Bottle from Champion of the Thames, Cambridge. Copper, clear. Tiny bit of head. Malty, metallic scent. Sweetish caramel malt taste. The forced carbonation gives the palate a bit of a boost. There’s not all that much to it, but that’s the point. It’s a light ale and more than lives up to its name. Better than GK IPA.
Greene King Light Ale;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Bottle at home in London. Pours clear, ruby-gold with a small, creamy white head.

Light sweet finish, toasty sugars, light sweet berries, some vanilla frosting, bread, low leafy bitterness. A touch watery perhaps, but overall it’s a fairly tasty, fairly harmless bitter.

Had this at Dickens festival yestetrday thus this beer came out of retirement and wasn’t bad as far as gimicky Christmas ales go. I was sure this was spiced ,but maybe i was just trying to get with the spirit but this has a very fruity spice finish but apparently no spices used . Otherwise lots of butterscotch, caramel malts and those kinda customary textures.

Federation Angel Ale (Bottle);Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Bottle: Clear/hazy brown/red colour, with a nice head. Aroma was dominated of caramel and a fruity,hopy end. Flavor was almost the same, here was the hopynes moore dominated and the caramel was moore anonymius. Thin body, medium bitter finish.
Federation Angel Ale (Bottle);Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);I see by the photo that this comes in brown bottles. Mine was clear and I’m sure it had some effect on the result, but I don’t think it can carry all of the blame. Pours a light-hazed bright copper with a big, cream-colored head that settles rockily and laces. Skunky herbalness conflicts rather than complements stale caramel with touches of gunpowder and a hint of lemon. Flavor is dirty caramel with metallic notes and a sad splash of sourness. Very sad. The only good thing about this beer was that it exposed me to the work of sculptor Antony Gormley and my new favorite installation. Purchased from Di Carlo Fine Wines and Spirits, Mundelein, IL 60060
Federation Angel Ale (Bottle);Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Murky tan-orange, looks like a glass of ice tea. Nose of sweetened caramel, plenty of breadiness, bit off with some garbage characteristics. Flavor is very sweet, caramel and butterscotch, extremely sugary. A few hops, a mite nutty. Nothing exciting.
Federation Angel Ale (Bottle);Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Enticing amber color with a thin, but persistent, off-white head. Aroma of East Kent Golding hops and toffeeish malt that is classic English in every way. Simple yet enticing. Firm, overly sweet mouthfeel with good flavor of a classic English export ale and a surprising kick of apple-like acidity. It is mostly straightforward but is marred by an overly toasty, high-dried malt flavor and a very odd bitterness in the finish that distracts and is not consistent with the overall, lush impression of this ale.
Federation Angel Ale (Bottle);Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);This is a tasty bitter, a hazy copper drink with a creamy-but-short-lived-head. The aroma is toffee and apples with a light, earthy hop smell. Perhaps a bit thin, it nonetheless delivers a satisfying caramel & toffee malt taste with a bit off nuttiness added. The finish is slightly hop-bitter, rounding off the drinking experience nicely. The Beer Geek, Springfield, IL
Federation Angel Ale (Bottle);Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);(Bottle 50 cl) Deep, hazy amber with a creamy, off-white head and some sediment in the bottle.

Federation Angel Ale (Bottle);Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Attractive squat clear bottle, informative label. Ale is beautiful medium copper. Pours small head which leaves a tangle of huge bubbles in the bottle. Head fades quickly, alas, leaving a skim of foam and some lacing in the glass. Aroma is fruity, with apple, pear and quince. Some citrus and herbs. A hint of spice. Flavor is solid malt, apple, and big hop bitterness. Some herbs and chocolate, spice and burnt malt. Wonderful mouthfeel. Starts solid and tingly, finishes lighter with lingering pucker. Great ale, and 550 ml as opposed to usual 500.

Radermacher Rader Blonde;Aubel, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie de l'Abbaye du Val-Dieu;Aug 2010: Dumpy brown 33cl bottle, picked up in Antwerp at some random beer shop I stumbled across while walking the wife. I poured the beer into my ’Forbidden Fruit’ chalice (only because the beer is supposed to be flavoured with a Juniper Berry distillate!). I poured the whole bottle in, I wasn’t going to, intending to leave the sediment within the bottle, but I missed the ’cut off point’ and hey presto, out came the grist. The beer would have been a clear but dull orange, old gold colour. It still was, but without the clear body, because of the floating particles i’d allowed out the bottle. The head was a deep blanket of white foam which stayed throughout the tasting. Juniper beeries aren’t supposed to smell of Wiltshire Ham are they? Well this beer did (smell of cold cut, cured Ham), unless my nose lost the plot completely. The swurling sediment slowly began to settle and I took my first sip. Forget the hammy smells, this is a sour berry beer, lemon and limes too! Really interesting Blonde this one, you’d never guess the flavours from the smell, well I was fooled anyway. Real Gin and Tonic style feel to it. What a pity the wife is in London at a West End Show tonight, she’d have raved about this beer. Different and well made, I’ll suprise my good lady next week (in Brugge) if I see this on any beer menu. Edit bit: I did find it in Brugge and the wife did rave about it!
Kuhnhenn Penetration Porter;Warren, Michigan, United States;Porter;Kuhnhenn Brewing;14 Oz draft at Kuhnhenn. A robust porter malt roast comes to my nose as soon as the glad is art down. Dark black color, a thin tan head. Taye had a bit of sweetness up front, but more than offset by some rotary malt. Roast is not overdone, though, and has a bit of a fight with sweet malt, which neither side wins. Result is a more complex new that's interesting and enjoyable. A bit of fresh yeast lurks at the bottom of the tumbler.

Kuhnhenn Helles Bock;Warren, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Ok, just a note: this is a brand new brewery, so all reviews must be taken with a grain of salt. The helles bock was defined by an apple flavor. I am not sure where it would come from ... I have never heard of an apple off-flavor (I am not talking about a cidery taste, but a true apple flavor.) I thought that it made this beer wonderfully refreshing ... but not really true to style. The color was burnt orange. The smell is fantastic. This is different, but quite good.

Kuhnhenn Lemon Saison;Warren, Michigan, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Kuhnhenn Brewing;I might need to try a larger sample than the ounce or so I had. Also, in it's defense, the woman who served it to me said that it was right at the bottom of the batch. This was think and tasted like corn syrup and vinegar. I'll have to try it again when I'm back, but this swill was among the worst I've ever had at my first tasting.

Main Street Brewery Black Pearl Stout;Corona, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);(Draft: 2005 San Diego Festival of Beer in San Diego, CA) When I first moved to San Diego in 2001, I volunteered to pour beer at a festival in San Marcos (the one and only time this festival existed). I got to try numerous beers at the festival before doing my pouring duties, and felt that Main Street’s Black Pearl Stout was the best beer there. So imagine my luck when I was assigned to pour for Main Street. I bragged all afternoon that I was pouring the best beer at the festival, and the brewer and his wife were amazed at my enthusiasm. Ever since, I’ve seen them at festivals all over San Diego County, and they are great people. And this beer is still wonderful.Having tried five mediocre beers tonight, it’s about time I drink something I know will be tasty and enjoyable. Black Pearl Stout is just the beer I need. Roast and sweet chocolate is the name of the game here, with only a moderate bitterness for some balance to keep the beer lively and interesting without sacrificing the style. The nose features strong roast and toasty grain, with lots of chocolate. Medium-full bodied, trending toward full, slightly sticky, but not cloying. Very dark brown in color, almost totally opaque, except at the edges. The tan head pours small and settles to a thin ring. I do love Black Pearl, and it will always hold a special place in my heart. And it’s always nice to know there will always be a good stout at a festival if Main Street Brewery is there.
Main Street Brewery Black Pearl Stout;Corona, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Main Street Brewery (Corona, CA);"Tap@lamppost pizza. Black; opaque with a tan, creamy head of monstorous proportion(took a few minutes to pour); no lace until the bottom 1/3 of the glass, likely due to temperature. Fullish body, slightly dry; foamy, fizzy carbonation and a bit ""liquidy."" Yeast; molasses, chocolate, toasted grain and caramel on the aroma. Flavor was yeasty throuout; sour like rising dough; slight alconol flavor in finish; toasted chocolate(milk + dark); nutty like hazelnuts; touch of caramel; toasted grains; lightly bitter finish, sour. Nice stout and noticably the best of the 3 beers I had tonight. Body is a bit off; the cabonation and body just aren’t blending well."
Bar Harbor Lighthouse Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Mild Ale;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;It poured a brownish/orange color with a half inch head that dissipates to a centimeter and lingers for a minute. A perfect foamy lacing surrounded the sides of the glass. Barely any carbonation was seen rising. The smell had some fruits, possibly plum. The hops are subdued but are slightly noticeably there. The taste had a light maltiness to it. Some of the fruits came back. There were some slight chocolatey tones to the taste. The hops are lightly balanced in. Closer to the end of the beer, some raisins came out. The palate was about a medium. The light ABV helped contribute to a mainly drinkable beer. Overall, this was an excellent beer. I would have this again in a heartbeat.

Aroma is typical New Englander type ale- ringwood butteriness diacetyl with light crystal malt sweetness and some earth tones.

Nussdorfer Sir Henry English Stout;Wien, Austria;Stout;Nussdorfer Brauhaus;After all the hype over this beer (Michael Jackson's favourite Austrian beer) I expected more. Overly sweet, in a sickly way, with way too much caramel. Body is too thin to hold this much flavour. Nothing like an English stout, but if you take it on it's own merits, not too bad I suppose - if you like sweet beers like mackesons. (on draught in brewpub)

My overriding impression was ""dandelion and burdoch"" - a drink we in the UK are fed as children. It's a kind of woody, resinious and very unusual flavour but here it works very well with the full-bodied pale beer. Surprised and impressed - can Wieden do no wrong? (on draught in the brewpub)"

New Belgium Skinny Dip (Loft);Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);12oz bottle pours with a crystal clear deep gold body that has copper hues and supports a thin near white head of foam. The mild aroma offers up hop spiciness and lime as well as faint spicy yeasty notes and a dash of sweet apple and pear. The taste starts with fairly crisp spicy to lime like hoppiness that carries a pleasing degree of hop bitterness. It then flows into faint cracker malts and then vaguely sweet apple like fruity esters.

Hale's Mongoose IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Hale's Ales;From a 12 oz into a stem glass. Pours cloudy gold apricot with head and lace. Aroma of grains, citrus zest, hops.

Hale's Mongoose IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Hale's Ales;"From Jul 2007 Purchased at Wilbur's Liquors in Ft Collins for US$7.49 a 6 Pack. This beer pours from 12oz bottle a clear medium gold with a medium sized head of foam. After a few minutes, the foam is all but gone but it does have some lacing in the early stages. The smell has a huge grapefruit nose along with some floral hops. The taste starts off with the grapefruit and follows through with floral hops that makes for some real strong bitterness. As I swish the Ale in my mouth, I'm picking up some malt that I didn't notice when I was just sipping....it's earthy and it gives some balance to this very bitter IPA. The finish for me alternates between the hop bitterness and earthy malt and I quite like it. I'm also getting some grain the more sips I take. I think it's more complex than what the first taste would have you believe...this is a good sipping IPA and I'd guess that the alcohol content would be somewhere between 6.5% and 7% abv as it's no ""light weight"". Solid IPA if you're willing to give it a chance to warm up a bit..."

L'Amère à Boire Blanche;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;An unclear light orange beer with a small white head. The aroma is sweet with strong notes of wheat, but also notes of coriander and banana. The flavor is also very wheaty with notes of oranges, banana, and hints of coriander, leading to a dry wheaty end. Drinking this, I interpreted it as a fusion between a German Hefeweizen, with the malted wheat and banana flavors, and a Wit, with the spices especially coriander - which the description also states, though it is listed as a Wit. I never found a fusion wheat that I really liked.

Dieu du Ciel! Équinoxe du Printemps;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Flaska från SB, nästan två år gammal. Kastanjebrun, klar med ljusbeige krämig krona. I smak och doft främst rostade toner och en lätt maltsötma. Rågkorn, rågbröd, torkade plommon, rostat socker, muscovado. Mellanstor, något torr. I eftersmaken främst välrostad/bränd malt. Lönnsirapen inte särskilt markant annat än möjligtvis i sötman som ligger i bakgrunden - även om den främst tycks komma från malten i sig. Ganska enkel och straightforward. Smakar lite mer som en något större brown ale med sina rostade, torra toner. Lätt värme från alkoholen som annars är väl dold.

Dieu du Ciel! Déesse Nocturne;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Stout;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Appearance: Super creamy tan head with a dense black body. Look very good! Smell: Surprisingly mute actually. I coaxed out some faint hints of cocoa and charcoal but not much more. Taste: More charcoal (not harsh) with some coffee, bitter-sweet chocolate and an overall roasted character. It’s a little to subtle for my tastes but it gets a little more complex as it warms. Some bitterness at the end, hops maybe? Still, not as rich as i would have liked. Mouthfeel: Can’t really complain here as it’s oh so smooth. Quite full bodied with a low carbonation. Feels as comfortable as a blanket. Drinkability: No trouble at all here. I would gladly have another for sure but i’d probably opt for a pint instead of a glass.
Dieu du Ciel! Déesse Nocturne;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Stout;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;"On tap at DDC St-Jerome. This is a simple light black beer, well balanced with a surprisingly complex taste constituted in part with a nice subtle cocoa touch. I think it is a more ""general purposes"" black beer from DDC. It is lighter than most others black beers, and is not given up a lot as a compromise. In fact, I just enjoy it more because of that."

Dieu du Ciel! Rigor Mortis Double;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Une double après une smoked. Une fois le défilé des camions de pompiers qui n’en finissaient plus de courir aux incendies terminé, on ferme la Caserne 30 puis on se lance dans la double. Comment heurter mes habitudes biéristiques. Robe ambrée plutôt pâlotte surmonté d’une anneau mousseux. Malts caramélisés, prune rouge, touche d’épices, corps moyen, effervescence plaisante. Une dubbel qui ne vient clairement pas de Belgique mais dont l’interprétation de ce style me ravit. Aucun arrière-goût, les saveurs sont brèves, délicates et agréables. Son manque de profondeur en fait une dubbel de soif, aussi étrange cela puisse-t-il être.

Dieu du Ciel! Rigor Mortis Double;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Un verre sur place. Bière cuivrée foncée presque rouge, à vrai dire elle est rouge. La robe est superbe mais malheureusement le reste ne suit pas. Au nez tout est sucré, il y a beaucoup de caramel et trop peu d’épice. En bouche le liquide est visqueux, amère, sucré de surcroît et à la limite de l’astringence. J’aime la série Rigor Mortis, peut-être que cette bière ne s’est pas présentée sur son meilleur jour. 5/10

La Barberie Rousse Légère et Fruitée;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Microbrasserie La Barberie;"Draught. At La Barberie brewpub, Québec City. Slightly hazy amber-orange with a small head. Aroma of malt, some light hops, and vague fruit sweetness. Lightly fruity sweet malt flavour, as it warms the ""beer"" character (including gentle hops) moves to the fore, and what ""fruit"" there was fades completely into the background. Average body, average mouthfeel, nice astringency, light carbonation, and it has a fairly bitter linger - not bad ... actually an acceptable bitter, but if it’s supposed to be fro-tay, it should have more fruit character - or just be called a ""rousse bitter"""
La Barberie Rousse Légère et Fruitée;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Tap. May 2004 at Barberie. Deep red copper ale with off-white head. Sweet aroma but no fruits detected. Fairly short attack of sweet malts and hops. Nicely balanced though. Medium bodied.
La Barberie Blanche à lÉcorce dOrange et Coriandre;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Detergent, soapy water, thin thin thin. Nothing other than Pledge like citrous flavor. Any flavour found in this beer is extremely fleeting adn dissapears almost before it can be percieved. It is extremely clear piss coloured (not typical of wits) It lacks any effervescense (no good for a wit). No head retention. This beer wins the prize for worst beer of the trip to Montreal hands down. Maybe even worst than Blanche de Breughel which is saying alot.

La Barberie Stout Classique;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Stout - Dry;Microbrasserie La Barberie;I believe this was the stout that was served at the hostel on Ste-Ursule in Québec. It was a rather thin stout with a fair chocolate malt character. It had a decent hop flavour and the standard roast character for a stout. The only thing that was rather strange for this beer was a pronounced ale fruitiness that was somewhat unpleasant or at least ditracting. The beers were also oxidized both times I had it.

RJ Sainte Paix Pommes;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasseurs RJ;Originally rated April 2005. I love apple beer ! This one pours a cloudy yellow-white with amber highlights. The white head is fizzy, with good retention. The nose is, of course apples, but mixed in with the scent of a witbier. The base of this beer seems to be a witbier. The taste is surprisingly not much of apples, mostly a white beer. Apple taste are felt in the burp section. Carbonation is pretty crazy and wild. Must be a great summer brew. Will try it next on a hot sunny day. Recommended if you like fruit beers that are more on the beer side, then the fruit side.
RJ Sainte Paix Pommes;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasseurs RJ;Acheté au métro en format de 660ml et dégusté dans un verre de blanche de chambly. Apparence jaune ambré au reflet orangé avec peu d’effervescence et aucune mousse. Odeur de pomme fraiche, rhubarbe et kiwi avec une touche de canelle et de levure. Goût de pomme verte et levure avec une bonne gazéfication et c’est à peu près tout. Absolument rien de wow, mais quand même une bière acceptable lors des soiré chaude d’été...
RJ Sainte Paix Pommes;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasseurs RJ;Bottle (650ml), thanks Hogtown Harry. Dark cloudy yellow, thick small white head, decent lacing. Strong green apple aroma, some wheat like notes as well - decent. Taste - bitter apple, not much else. Apple doesn’t taste too artificial actually - but it is not as strong as the aroma. Quenching when cold. Not bad.
RJ Sainte Paix Pommes;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasseurs RJ;Drank in a tulip. Cloudy golden poor, Very apple juice like with a thin white head. Aromas of intensely red apples (McIntosh), rhubarb, kiwi, a hint of cinnamon you basically have president choice grade apple pie. The acid side of the apple and the sourness of the rhubarb hits you right off the bat. Heavy effervest feel to the gums... not bad. To bad this beer is not a little more sweeter... This could be an even better brew. Added citrus like flavors to it. Dry bitter start with a lite sweet lasting finish. Predominant effervescence. Good balance between the sweet and sour.
RJ Sainte Paix Pommes;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasseurs RJ;Bottle shared with HogTownHarry & GregClow -- my bottle.

RJ Sainte Paix Pommes;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Brasseurs RJ;Not too shabby.

Acerbic at first, the residual maraschino-like cloying gives the tart a run for it’s money for a short while, but unfortunately both belligerants call it off a bit too quickly.

Lion d'Or Bishop's Best Bitter;Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lion d'Or / Golden Lion Pub & Brewery;Dégustée en compagnie de Marco sur la terrasse par un magnifique après-midi d’été. Bière ambré aux reflets orangés parfaitement filtrée à la mousse généreuse et plutôt collante sur mon verre. Le temps est parfait pour cette bière fraîche, houblonnée et jouissant d’une base bien maltée à la manière d’une bitter anglaise - quoique plus houblonnée et percutante. Rafraîchissante, tirant sur la noix de grenoble malgré un nez un peu beurré, la bière se boit comme de l’eau. Finale longue et plaisante, d’une amertume sèche de levure céréalière, une très bonne bière dans son style!
Lion d'Or Bishop's Best Bitter;Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lion d'Or / Golden Lion Pub & Brewery;Bière orangée cuivrée, plutôt limpide, bonne effervescence, et surmontée d’un beau col blanc cassé, bien dense et bien mousseux, très persistant, et qui colle sur les parois du verre. Arômes principalement houblonné, c’est très floral, mais également un peu herbacé. Aussi, je trouve que cette bière sent un peu les légumes bouillis (chou, oignon, tomate même…) et je crains un défaut dans celle-ci… Sinon, je perçois également quelques effluves maltés rappelant le foin. Nez peu agréable, faible complexité, bonne intensité cependant. En bouche, pétillement moyen-faible sur la langue, et breuvage très mince au palais. Au goût, foin, gazon, houblon floral, notes de légumes bouillis, mais c’est moins désagréable qu’au nez. Aucun sucré, amertume de faible à modérée qui colle longtemps en arrière-goût, forte impression aqueuse en bouche, moins intense en bouche qu’au nez, complexité médiocre. Soit je suis tombé sur une bouteille problématique (meilleure avant juin 2015), soit cette bière ne tombe vraiment pas dans mes cordes. Dégustation décevante…

Lion d'Or Bishop's Best Bitter;Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lion d'Or / Golden Lion Pub & Brewery;Bottle (500 ml) bought @ La Barik. Best before February 2015. FWIW, the clerk at the beer store told me it was fresh. Appearance: Clear dark amber/copper with a small beige head and little lacing. Aroma: Quite floral with a good mineral/earthy presence, light caramel and hints of almonds. Taste: Floral, caramel, quite earthy and slightly bitter. Palate: Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Mineral mouthfeel. Lingering moderate earthy bitterness finish. Overall: I would be curious to try this one on cask as the bottle is definitely not the best way to enjoy a bitter. I’m not 100% sure that this one is fresh either. Still, it’s pretty easy to drink and have very interesting mineral qualities.
Lion d'Or Bishop's Best Bitter;Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lion d'Or / Golden Lion Pub & Brewery;This was a pleasant discovery. Even after a dozen trips Broue Ha-Ha (local beer store) yields new fruit. Pours is a nice, clear amber with a finger of foam with good retention and great lacing. Nose is caramel and fresh earth, flowers and spice. Taste is caramel, a really nice toasted malt element, flowers, citrus, with a long, bitter, fragrant finish. Texture is a touch watery but this baby has more than enough character to compensate. Overall a really nice bitter, although I hope the Quebec language police don’t come after them for the name (’qu’ils mangent d’la marde).

Petite amertume pointue en bouche, après une vague de sucres retenus mais bien présents ; encore ici, les caramels dominent. L’effervescence est finalement adéquate, et les saveurs justes, sinon un peu timides vers la fin, où le côté ""bitter"" prend toute la place. Genre un peu méconnu au Québec, il s’agit d’une bonne représentante, assez désaltérante et simple comme le sont les anglaises."
Les Bières de la Nouvelle-France Cuvée du Père Sarrasin;Saint-Alexis-des-Monts, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Microbrasserie Nouvelle-France;Originally rated January 2006. Bought at the Dépanneur de la Rive in Cap-Rouge, Quebec. Best before date is long gone, April 2005. Ah well. Pours a nice golden-blonde colour with a very light cloud through it. Still, little carbonation left. Head is foamy and a bit of lace is left behind. The nose is malty and you can smell the buckwheat, nice and strong. Thin and oily mouthfeel. The taste start off sour (probably from being outdated) and finishes quite mild. I much prefered the other buckwheat brew this brewer brews called, Ambrée de Sarrasin.

Schoune Scotch Réserve;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Bouteille de 341 ml vieillie environ 6 ans. Nos yeux découvrent une couleur cuivrée-orangée avec une mousse légèrement beige très surprenante qui reste tout au long de la dégustation. Au moins un demi centimètre de mousse crémeuse.Je suis impressionné. Au nez on découvre des arômes de caramel brûlé, de poires mûres, d’alcool, de vin blanc, de pain brûlé, de banane flambée ainsi qu’un touche de madérisation. Jusque-là je suis surpris mais lorsqu’arrive l’étape du goût, on se rend vite compte que l’apparence et le nez nous ont jouer un tour par rapport à ce qui s’annoncait comme étant une excellente scotch ale. En faiteon détecte un corps mince-moyen et on goûte de caramel, le vinaigre, l’alcool, une acidité à faire fondre la trachée ainsi qu’un taux de madérisation extrême. La bière assèche la bouche comme un vin qui a beaucoup de tanins.
Schoune Scotch Réserve;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Bottle was fine. Poured a thick head, finely laced. Body was a hazy reddish swamp. Aroma had nothing special but it tasted quite bitter, leaving an aftertaste bordering on interesting/displeasing. Unexpected.
Schoune Scotch Réserve;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;"Uh-oh. Popped the cap and it's gushing. Foaming subsides after well over a minute but there is still liquid in the bottle although less then half remains. Here goes. Very sour aroma - not appealing. Thick tan head recedes to a splotchy cover. Murky brown body with plenty of floaties. Very sour vinegary flavour. Slick smooth mouthfeel. Drainpour. The Schoune infection strikes again. At 4.99 CDN a bottle it just ain't worth taking the chance even to support a ""local"" brewery. Bottle."
Schoune Scotch Réserve;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Hops and brown sugar aroma, murky brown, wearing a tan head.Flavour of sponge toffee and creme brule.

Worth it only because it was split between 4 RBers - Schoune lost $20 on that deal. Ha ha ha! Pours a large, almond head and a cloudy, deep amber body. Floral nose mixes with sweet hops and canidied caramel. Tart flavour with a new string of oriental ""sweet&sour"" hops. Pretty good. Not overly a Scotch Ale but tasty. This one avoided the Schoune Infection..."
Schoune Scotch Réserve;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Cloudy amber w/ light beige head. Candyish caramel, toffee aroma w/ notes of floral hops. Light, highly carbonated feel. Tart flavour of caramel & cotton candy. Not bad but one dimensional. As noted this is not a Scottish Ale. As well, hardly worth the $6.66 CND price.
Schoune Scotch Réserve;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Thanks to CapFuu for this one. Poured a cloudy amber with a medium sized white head. Aroma is candy and floral with a little alcohol as well. Taste is candy as well, caramel to be exact. I can taste the alcohol more than I would like to though. Smooth on the palate though, and overall a nice brew. Could be better with less alcohol taste present.
Schoune Scotch Réserve;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Poured a murky amber brew with lots of sediment and nice huge white head with good retention. More carbonated then expected. Taste is very caramely. Not as good as the Mcauslan Vintage Ale nut closer in terms of taste and color. I think as mentionned in the other review, this not very scotch-like and maybe more similar to a barley wine, though not the best one I would have drank. Overall enjoyable but a a bit expensive ($3.99 for 341ml).
Schoune Scotch Réserve;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;I've had it quite tart and alcohol tasting as well while I expected a sweet caramelic brew. Unpleasant.
Schoune Scotch Réserve;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Dark amber, thick whitish head and good carbonation.... not scottish alelike at all so far. Characteristic Schoune lactic infection.... not a nice characteristic for a rich malty brew. Nearly undrinkable. They have to do something about their sanitation procedures.

Schoune Suroît;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Originally rated August 2005. This blonde ale pours a hazy blonde-white colour with a nice creamy-foam white head that has very good retention. The lacing left is also pretty thick and uneven. The aromas start off on the grainy malt side, but end up being milder with a twist of hop. The mouthfeel is watery with a touch of graininess. The taste is pretty smooth and light on the grain-side, with a short finish of mild hop. Some very tame vanilla in the aftertaste. Quite dry. A beautifully looking blonde with a decent rest.

Unexpected aroma as far as a stout is concerned. Close your eyes and you’d swear it’s an ESB or something. Coniferous, floral hops and faint roasted malts. Taste is also “unstouty”. Caramel, pine-tree, hops. Judged as a stout it is truly terrible. Ignore the style and you’ve got an average pub beer. I just had my first black ESB!!!

Golden body with medium viscosity, still. Sweet aroma of honey, light pineapple, light vanilla, floral undertones. Sweet floral honey balanced by a nice fruity acidity, pineapple coming in again, oaky vanilla in the finish. This ends with a light tartness, which greatly adds to the drinkability for me.

Lurgashall Reserve / Special Reserve Mead;Lurgashall, West Sussex, England;Mead;Lurgashall Mead;500ml bottle (ChrisO’s post-GBBF2011 Wednesday) A slick and oily viscous fluid, looks like it will be sticky. Honey alcohol and molasses dominate the aroma, but there’s a sharpness too. Sharpness comes out more in the mouth, and in fact dominates. It’s aided by the bite of 17% alcohol. Too sharp for me. for 17% meads, give me the mjod style instead.

Lurgashall Reserve / Special Reserve Mead;Lurgashall, West Sussex, England;Mead;Lurgashall Mead;750 ml bottle shared with family. 2006 vintage Special Reserve. Poured into a small port glass, it is a warm golden yellow in color, flat. Aroma is honey, touch of spice, vanilla, dandelions, oak. It has a subtle flavor hint of golden rum - cane sugar? Flavors are heavy on sweetness, a little melon, honey, doughy bread. Finish is cloying, overly sweet. Not my favorite mead so far, but all around not bad.
Chouffe Envol 2000;Achouffe, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie d'Achouffe (Duvel-Moortgat);1.5 l bottle at Man in the Moon, Stockholm. Deep golden color with some yeast flocs and fluffy head. Dry, tart, fruity, herbal, peppery and very musty aroma. Sweeter, bready, fruity, herbal and musty flavor with vanilla, coriander and lemon. Drinkable but certainly past its prime.
Chouffe Envol 2000;Achouffe, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie d'Achouffe (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottled@Man In The Moon, Stockholm. Golden colour, small white head. Aroma is earth, yeast some mild fruity hops as well as some wooden notes. Flavour is toffee, caramel, hops and mild notes of wood and vanilla. Pleasantly balanced and rather fullbodied. Aftertaste gets some toffeeishness. Once it warms up some slight yeastyness and mild acidic notes show up, making it more complex. No big needs to have this one cooled down.
Chouffe Envol 2000;Achouffe, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie d'Achouffe (Duvel-Moortgat);In short: A very much oxidized, acidic, minty and yeasty 8 year old beer. Surprisingly still drinkable. How: Czech Republic trip planning tasting session, 1.5L bottle from Taktik_MTL’s brother. The look: Cloudy blonde body with a short-lived white head. In long: Not a rating per say. More a statement to anyone still holding on to one of those rare bottles. If you are keeping it for a special occasion I hope the occasion is coming soon. This single batch 8 year old beer is very much going downhill at this point. Aroma of white peppermint candy. The beer is as yeasty as it is oxidized. If a bottle could rust this one would have. Acidic from start to end. The acidic oxidation is reaching unpleasantness level, at least not to my gueuze-loving taste buds. Bready, lime, mint and some sawdust. Carbonation is still very lively and tickling. Finish is very short with the acidity and oxidation quickly washing up everything. Overall not bad at all if oxidation is not too much of problem for you. I mean the best-before date on this bottle was 2002, same the Low-Fat mayonnaise jar that’s sitting in my fridge, what the hell was I thinking…

Chouffe Envol 2000;Achouffe, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie d'Achouffe (Duvel-Moortgat);Another celebration with the Chouffes…These guys know how to party…They must have put lots of rosemary and mint in this one…Lime, oranges and various citrus fruit scent the already exuberantly spicy air...An 8-year-old bottle recently proved to have held up interestingly too...It was very oxidized of course, but all those herbs and spices were brazenly expressive and carbonation was still furiously excited...I love these Chouffe magicians…

Alchimiste Stout;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Stout;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Dégustée en fût au Saint-Bock à Montréal. De couleur noire et opaque. Nez de malt rôti, de chocolat noir, léger de café et avec des traces de chocolat au lait. Moyennement ronde en bouche avec un pétillement moyen et une texture plutôt crémeuse. Petites notes de chocolat au lait (notes lactiques) avec de faibles traces de vanille lors de l’entrée en bouche auquel se rajoute rapidement un goût moyennement amer de malt rôti et moyen de chocolat noir puis en finale vient se rajouter un léger goût de café noir avec des notes asséchantes de houblon herbeux. Post-goût moyen-long et un peu sec, moyennement amer de rôti, léger de chocolat noir avec des notes de café et de houblon herbeux. (printemps 2007)

Alchimiste Stout;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Stout;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Bottle [341ml]. Pours black with a fizzy diminishing tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, quite roasty, with lots of coffee, light leafy hops and a hint of vanilla. Slightly watery flavour of roasted malt, coffee and light leafy hops. Average bodied, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Pretty good, not great, but a fine Stout.

Alchimiste Stout;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Stout;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Bouteille qui indique 4.9 % d’alcool. Une fois versé, le liquide se présente complètement noir et est coiffé d’une petite mousse qui cherche à disparaître rapidement. Le café bien fort et le chocolat amer sont parmi les parfums les plus dominants. Le nez trouve aussi de la fumée et sans doute la présence d’une pointe d’avoine. Au goût, les grains torréfiés démontrent du caractère avec des attaques nettes d’espresso et de cacao. En bouche, le liquide joue sur deux fronts. En début de dégustation il est lourd et robuste. En fin de parcours il tend à perdre de la vigueur et devient plus mince. Finale appropriée et amère pour cette bière qui est, malgré tout, bonne.

Alchimiste Stout;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Stout;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;In short: A bitter stout with plenty of black coffee flavour. Simple but very enjoyable How: Tap at brewpub. Sold as “Noire Amère” (Bitter Black) The look: Black body topped by a small tan head In long: Nose is roasted coffee beans and green hops. Taste is straightforward but effective. Plenty of roasted malts, burnt toasts, cold bitter black coffee, a touch of vanilla, some very bitter black chocolate. Pleasant mouthfeel. Strong bitterness. Not a whole lot I can say about this one other than it is a nice straightforward beer that I could drink all night long. By far the best thing I’ve had from L’Alchimiste. I am now curious to try the bottle. L’Alchimiste is one of the oldest quebec micro and one that is totally ignored by us local beer geeks. L’Alchimiste brews are the fruits and vegetables and our beer stores are all you can eat buffets. And we are fat kids. Very fat kids.
Alchimiste Stout;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Stout;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;"Bought for 2,49$, 341 ml bottle, black label with ""stout noire"" written in golden letters, and the name of the brewer, Alchimiste, isn’t written anywhere on the cap, bottle or label. Are they shy? Well, they shouldn’t be with this pretty bitter chocolate and espresso dominantly flavored stout. Nothing’s wrong with the texture or carbonation, aroma might not be that appealing but the long and pleasant aftertaste makes me think it is one of the very good stouts brewed in Quebec."

Nicely balanced sweetness and leafy bitterness. Smooth full body with prickly and crispy carbonation. Medium strength finish that lingers for a moment with spicy fresh grassy hops, butterscotch and bread feel. Very fresh and filling. Tasty flavors, well intensified. A cross between IPA and red ale. Overall very good quality craft.
Alchimiste India Pale Ale;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;IPA;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Bière orangée-cuivrée, légèrement voilée, effervescence moyenne, et surmontée d’un col beige moyennement large, mais très dense, très mousseux, cotonneux même, et qui s’affaisse tout doucement en laissant une riche dentelle sur les parois du verre. Arômes de pain grillé, grain rôti, malt caramélisé et légèrement fumé… tendance davantage vers le sucre d’orge et petits fruits par moment… subtile noisette… Aussi, effluve d’un houblon qui semble principalement floral, mais également un peu herbacé (gazon, feuille verte…), fruité (pamplemousse) et poivré. Nez correctement agréable et intéressant, complexité adéquate pour le style, intensité un peu faible cependant. En bouche, pétillement moyen sur la langue, breuvage un peu mousseux mais bien rond au palais, belle onctuosité, c’est bien moelleux et velouté. Au goût, entrée maltée principalement céréalière, plus rôtie que ce que le nez laissait présager. Saveur de pain grillé, grain brut rôti, céréale assez racée avec une certaine saveur poivrée (on croirait à l’utilisation de seigle!), noix, caramel, sucre foncé à tendance chocolat brun voire même mélasse, léger malt fumé (tourbe, boisé…). C’est accompagné d’un houblon à la fois bien présent et aux saveurs assez diffuses, floral, légèrement herbacé, poivre, pamplemousse… Finale à l’amertume de faible à modérée, goût de grain rôti qui persiste jusqu’en toute fin de bouche. IPA de type anglaise qui planche beaucoup sur l’aspect rôti du grain, ça me plaît bien et ça me semble assez original (au Québec, en 2016!). Très bonne intégration des différentes saveurs entre elles, complexité et intensité assez élevées. Très bonne bière!

Effluves qui semblent légèrement fruités par moment, baies, fraise, réglisse rouge… Nez ordinaire, complexité et intensité faibles. En bouche, pétillement plutôt faible sur la langue, onctuosité intéressante au palais, la bière est ronde et corpulente, beaux moelleux et velouté.

Bon goût, bel équilibre des saveurs, complexité et intensité en bouche moyennes. Bière plutôt moyenne dans l’ensemble, mais bonne et intéressante pour son style!

Alchimiste Claire;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Pours a clear straw topped by about half a finger of bright white fizzy head showing moderate retention and leaving some nice lacing. The nose is mostly doughy with a sweet basement yeast almos toverpowering the herbal hops.The taste, however, is less doughy and more grainy with fresh malts leading the attack. The hops leave a mild bitterness expanding into a just as mild finish. Crisp, refreshing, a nice lager on its own or paired with a salad or some roasted chicken. Cheers!

Elle possède un nez de lie, lointain, et rafraîchissant. Elle possède un goût amer et légèrement salé. Intrigante, son amertume reflète semblablement celle d’une friandise sûre. On goûte bien l’aspect épicé, mais la lie semble un peu plus discrète. L’amertume est prenante, mais c’est vraiment une bière d’été, avec une généreuse tranche de citron. Excellente !

Breughel Kamour Biere Blanche;Saint-Germain-de-Kamouraska, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie Breughel;Originally rated May 2006. Purchased at the Dépanneur de la Rive in Cap-Rouge, Quebec. Pours a hazy golden colour with a small white head that dissipates fast enough. No lacing left behind. Very active tiny-bubbled carbonation from the bottom of the glass. The nose starts off on the strong alcohol side, but ends up with some Belgian yeast, lemon and hints of spices. Watery mouthfeel with a fizzy moment. The taste is pretty close to its stronger brother, the Kamour Double (which I just had an few minutes before). Weak and lemony, pears and apples, trying hard but falling short. A tad more consistent and balanced as the Double version, but still bland.

Looks like soda pop over fresh ice, except smaller. Soon there are no remnants of bubbles Iron aroma. Not attractive. No typical beer smells. What is this? Almost tastes like cider. Any wheat flavor present is dominated by sourness that reminds me of extreme candy. I keep taking sips hoping to find something positive to say. This is perhaps the worst beer I’ve ever had.

Poured medium amber, with a large tan head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, with ginger in the background. Flavor is more impressive than the aroma, with caramel, ginger, brown sugar, orange rind, honey, and perhaps some lemongrass. Ginger hangs out for a long finish. This beer was nicely executed, the ginger was not overdone."

Bar Harbor Ginger Mild Brew;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Other;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;Poured from a 22 oz. bomber purchased directly from the brewer. Appearance is a hazy amber, with thin off-white head and good carbonation bubbles working thru the entire glass, yet little lacing. Aroma is very faint, and what is there seems to be slight ginger, but difficult to tell. Mouthfeel is tingly from the bubbles, but thin and somewhat watery. Taste, like nose, is weak, although the ginger comes thru a little more. This all leads to a finish that is slightly bitter and metallic, with a stale aftertaste. I love ginger in Asian food, and soft drinks. However, if this is an indication of their effect on beer, I’ll pass.

What if you dig deeper? -It finishes sweet and spicy, with a bothersome yeasty dryness. -The overall flavor profile is a one trick pony. -Some people may find this a fun novelty item, but apart from being a conversation piece or accompanying spicy foods, I don’t see its purpose.

Smells of butterscotch and yeast cake, sour canola and some medicine. Taste is slightly fermented corncobs and honey - an odd combo, with a hint of perfume/stale hops. Flat, slick, sticky mouthfeel, watery and thankfully quick off the palate - not horrid, but not one to have again.
Alchimiste Cristal;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;A lightly hazed yellowish weizen with a thick creamy white head.

Alchimiste Cristal;Joliette, Quebec, Canada;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Alchimiste - Microbrasserie;Bottle - 341ml. Hazy pale blond body with good carbonation and a fair white frothy head. Its malty/hoppy aroma carries citrusy, biscuity and grassy notes. Taste is fair, but it is a way too bitter for a Kristallweizen. It ends with a short bitter finish. Drinkable, but does not really corresponds to the style.

The aroma has a decent combo of wheat and citrus but it doesn’t make me want to drink this beer badly. The flavor is dry and tart with a medium presence of citrus, it’s so boring that I feel my tastebuds falling asleep. The palate is medium and oily while the carbonation is soft. It’s not bad in any way but it fails to spark any insterest and the sink is already calling for it as I write those words.

Commercially hyped in the nineties but discontinued after some years due to lack of success - a sign the Belgians still know to a certain degree which beers to ignore.

Il s’agit en effet d’une des bières de style abbaye avec la carbonation la moins perspicace que je connaisse, mais comparativement a d’autres critique son goût m’a beaucoup plu. Je consens qu’il n’est pas accessible et que cette bière est vraiment lourde, presque sirupeuse, elle s’approche d’une stout tout en assumant un sucré extrêmement typique d’une brune. Je dirais que cette bière est trop ambitieuse, trop Immense. Ces saveurs se confondent dans un tout proche de la melasse, mais reste très interessante en dégustation. Malgré tout je reste perplexe. La preuve en est dans la description confuse des saveurs que je me souviens, ne pense qu’a sucre sucre sucre sucre BRUN BRUN BRUN BRUN.

Goût similaire mais un peu trop de torréfaction qui vient gâché la fin de bouche. Texture un peu huileuse. Overall c’est proche mais pas tout à fait une réussite.

Saint Arnould L'Évêque;Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Microbrasserie Saint Arnould (Coop Brassicole des Laurentides);341ml bottle poured into a tulip glass around 10 – 12 degrees This brew pours a dark toned robe with a reddish hue topped by a thin tanned head showing an oily lacing. The nose offers enjoyable notes of dark chocolate paired with orange and hazelnuts. The taste is strangely fruity yet giving bitter dark chocolate notes which I enjoyed since there seemed to be a nice balance between the bitter and the sweet. The element breaking that bond is the alcohol which wraps the tongue in a bothering oily blanket. The oily feeling transcends in the overall feel of the brew but lets it finish dry even so. This product surprises, being what you’d expect from a Belgian strong ale, but would totally be drinkable if it wasn’t for the alcohol standing out too much. I found it interesting but a bit on the flat side and not so good overall. I’ll put it down ’’average’’.

Pours clear pale straw with small white head. Faint aroma of malt, hops and citrus. Paperlike onset, leading to a watery body tasting of yeast, with hints of citrus and hops. Rough aftertaste of cardboard. This has nothing to do with Witbier. Or any other decent beer for that matter. It looks like a Pale Lager and tastes like water that has been used to rinse a portion of washing. Filth!

Pours golden orange with thin to medium white head. Aromas of citrus, pine, light british malts. Taste is much of the same with a pleasant floral quality balanced by just enough malt in the finish. Drank 2 of these guys while I waited to check in at the hotel. Cheers Tim. Had it recently and it was pretty bad compared to when i had it a few years back. Hops were restrained, just mostly some spicy grains and malt.

Da war es für mich das erste Bier, das in einer durchsichtigen Glasflasche jene Leute ansprechen wollte, die kein ""bitteres"" Lagerbier und auch keinen Radler mögen - meist junge und/oder weibliche Leute. Es ist eigentlich gar nicht so schlimm -der Pilsgeschmack ist nícht schlecht komponiert, es ist halt einfach unglaublich wässrig und langweilig. Dies hat den Vorteil, dass man es im Sommer trinken kann, auch wenn es nicht mehr eiskalt ist (es wird nicht schal); der Nachteil ist, dass es unglaublich wässrig und langweilig ist.

Trout River Whitewater;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Trout River Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking hazy golden burnt yellow to orange color with a decent transparency about it. Carbonation runs up fast. Quickly dissipating little white bubbly head. No lacing. The smell had some sweet citrus, light honey, sweet wheaty/graininess. The taste was mainly sweet through the previously mentioned flavors. Light sweet wheaty aftertaste. Light bodied. Low carbonation. Overall, this was a decent wheat ale.
Trout River Whitewater;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Trout River Brewing Company;Sampled from vt beer festival. A bad beer, I actually dumped it out in the trash can, wasting a beer ticket. I don’t get why they brew this one, Iike some of their other beers.
Trout River Whitewater;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Trout River Brewing Company;@VT Beerfest–on tap-pours a thin white head and cloudy yellow color. Aroma is wheat, coriander, yeast. Taste is wheat, citrus-orange/lemon, coriander, yeast. OK effervescence.
Trout River Whitewater;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Trout River Brewing Company;Sampled at vt brewfest. Pours a light gold with a thin white head. Aroma of lemon, and some citrus. Flavor of wheat, and malts and is very thin bodied. Nothing great.
Trout River Whitewater;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Trout River Brewing Company;A very bland tasting beer with very little in the way of redeeming qualities. It’s their attempt at a whitbier and it comes up very short.
Trout River Whitewater;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Trout River Brewing Company;Pours gold with a small, white head and big carbonation bubbles. Aroma of malt, hops, citrus, honey. Tastes malty, with some hopcit at the finish. I did not detect any off odors or flavors in this one. Light in palate and body.
Trout River Whitewater;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Trout River Brewing Company;Light lemon nose. Hazy. Moderate carbonation. Light and blandish. I really don’t like this style of beer.
Trout River Whitewater;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Trout River Brewing Company;Lightly citrus and wheaty aroma. Hazy golden colour with thin, fizzy white fully diminishing head.

Trout River Whitewater;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Trout River Brewing Company;Golden in color with a small white head.Canned vegteable aroma mixed with plastic and alcohol.

Trout River Whitewater;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Trout River Brewing Company;Cloudy gold color with some big bubbles. Alcohol, plastic and rotting corn aroma. You have to be kidding me. It tastes about as bad as it smells. Horrible beer.
Albert Heijn Witbier;Zaandam, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Albert Heijn;4/10/2006 1:34:46 PM Bottle at home. Surprisingly good for the beer from my local supermarket. Very tall head, citrusy taste but very smooth. Fine enough.
Albert Heijn Witbier;Zaandam, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Albert Heijn;Pours a very hazy and really pale yellow color, topped with an average white frothy head. Citrusy nose with faint spices also present. Some fruity sweetness at start, overtaken by citric feel. Some spices and a bit wheaty. Not the best witbier, but surely a decent one.
Albert Heijn Witbier;Zaandam, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Albert Heijn;22.07.’14 Amsterdam. Hazy pale yellow color, with a white head. Aroma: wheatmalts, citrus peal. Medium body. Taste: coriander, some fruits citrus/orange peal, sweet, bitter notes. Refreshing.
Albert Heijn Witbier;Zaandam, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Albert Heijn;Brewed for a big Dutch grocery store, might be good in Belgium, but not in the Netherland unfortunately.
Albert Heijn Witbier;Zaandam, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Albert Heijn;AH’s answer to Hoegaarden. I don’t think Hoegaarden paid attention. Compared to AH Pilsener, which actually exceeds expectations, this one underachieves. Flat, not flavorful, with a weak palate.
Albert Heijn Witbier;Zaandam, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Albert Heijn;Very pale yellow colour that reminds of chamomile. Hazy with medium activity in the glass, one-and-a-half finger of head with good retention. Smell of fruit but very faint. Some coriander on the taste, some faint orange. Medium thickness on the body and quite carbonated. Also, dry on the palate. Overall a cheap alternative to other white beers out there, but below average.
Albert Heijn Witbier;Zaandam, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Albert Heijn;Nice hazy yeoow color with decent white foam head. Aroma is weak citrus and sugar. Taste is refereshing, citrus but also some wood tones. Decent but short aftertaste, fruity. Sweet. (Velp 201208)
Albert Heijn Witbier;Zaandam, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Albert Heijn;Cloudy yellow colour with a fine white top. Light citric and a bit spicy aroma. A mild sweet texture. Wheat, fruity and light spicy flavour. [Can from Albert Heijn in Egmond Aam Zee, Holland]
Albert Heijn Witbier;Zaandam, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Albert Heijn;Bottle. This is a clear example that not all supermarket beers are bad. This is not the best witbier around, but certainly not the worst. Pours a pale yellow color with a small white head on to that fades away quite quick. Citrus aroma with some faint spicey notes. Flavor is watery, bit sour with a bitter finish. Average witbier, that’s all.
Albert Heijn Witbier;Zaandam, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Albert Heijn;The head is robust. It smells citrus sweet. The taste is citrus, yeasty. In the aftertaste bitter-grassy, dry. Not Bad! 7/8/8/8/5/8
Goose Island Dortmunder;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at HDG. Cloudy yellow with a sturdy white head. Aroma is subtle malts with some tangerine. Taste is spot on what I expect. Nice tasty malts are the highlight. Body is smooth with a snappy hop bitterness in the finish.
Goose Island Dortmunder;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Last of the afternoon. Had a great time at Clybourn. As the afternoon progressed the notes were less involved. Go Figure? Clear and pale golden. Heardly noticeable nose. Dry and crisp. Sweet. Easy drinking, yet unimpressed.
Goose Island Dortmunder;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);A tasty brew though I would say that w/ it’s hop character and ABV, it’s closer to Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold than a traditional Dortmunder export--not that there’s anything wrong w/ that. It’s a slightly orange golden--maybe a touch darker than I would expect--w/ a foamy white head and lots of lace. The nose is mostly hoppy--slightly citric w/ a definitely funky earthy undertone. The malt character is subdued and mostly limited to a simple sweetness with some bready character which is complimented by an earthy bitterness in the finish.
Goose Island Dortmunder;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Decent Dort. Not as bready as I’d like, a bit overhopped perhaps? Earthy body with a bit of musk and some bitterness coming through. I bit thin for as big as it’s supposed to be. Decent, but not outstanding.
Goose Island Dortmunder;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Clybourn. Clear gold with a big, fluffy, pillow-like white head and lacing that mimics a blanketing snow drift. Crisp lemons, subtle spicy floral hops, spray starch and fresh, staunchy baguettes make-up the aroma portion of the show. Crisp and semi-musky flavor tendencies help to elevate this one to a position of power that challenges Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold from the get-go. Big, bready currents. Charming, subtle and spicy hop profile. Baguette crunch is furthered with decorative flour powder. Never acidic or astringent. Medium-bodied and we’re doing great. Balance is achieved to-a-tee, finishing with baguettes, potato bread and yeasty flour assertions. Best of class, no doubt.
Goose Island Dortmunder;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap, Wrigleyville. Lightly perfumey noble hop aroma. Strongly bitter without much malt chewiness or thickness to fight it. Thin bodied.
Goose Island Dortmunder;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Pale in color and a small but consistant head. Heavy hoppy nose, fruity, flowery, and a little spice, but can't quite figure out just what. Clean and hoppy on the tongue with a smooth aftertaste. A good American version, but not quite up to the level of Helles I had in the past. Recommend on tap in Wrigleyville pub. If you seek a bottle, go for the Great Lakes Dortmunder if you can find it.
Goose Island Dortmunder;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Not much aroma, light yellow. . . apple juice alcohol on the tongue. Bitter hops not unpleasant, and not overly impressive either.
Goose Island Dortmunder;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);One of the better beers of this style that I''ve had. Decent light malts with a heavy hops (at least for my experience) in the finish. A crisp, clean, easy-drinking beer.
Goose Island Dortmunder;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Mostly diminishing head. Pale golden in color. Alcohol fairly apperent in the taste. Sharp hoppy flavor, hoppy finish.
Goose Island Schwarzbier;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at the Clybourn location. Pours a very dark brown color, bordering on black. Pretty good tan head that recedes somewhat quickly and leaves a bit of a cap. The nose brings quite a bit of roasted character as well as some slight smoke and peaty characteristics. Light chocolate there as well. The taste is slightly roasted with a bit of smoke. Well done, but a bit plain and doesn’t stand out among its peers. Good body with a nice amount of roast. Drank quite well in the end and was nice on a cool December afternoon. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 01-02-2011
Goose Island Schwarzbier;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampled from the tap at the Clybourn location. Poured dark brown with a smokey white head that dissipated slowly to the edges. Aroma was smokey with roasted malts, biscuit and earthy grains backing. Flavor had smoked and roasted notes with a bit of a thin finish.
Goose Island Schwarzbier;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampled at goose cly... Pours a deep dark toffee brown with deeper brown hues and a thin light beige head... Somewhat smokey and pre-dominantly roasty aroma, chocolate notes in the background... More roasty than smoke in the flavor with an adequately chocolate malt backbone. Thin to medium mouthfeel with average carbonation... Liked the aroma most.
Goose Island Schwarzbier;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);[Tap] Pours an opaque black color with a small amount of brown head. Aroma of cocoa powder, vanilla and roasted dark malts. Some coffee along with charred malt and astringent grainy taste. Light chocolate lingers in the finish. Mouthfeel was a bit chalky, but the palate was pretty decent. Easy to drink and well made.
Goose Island Schwarzbier;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at the brewpub (Chicago, IL). Pours roasty blackish hue with brownish bottom, lighter, near opaque, but the bottom is murky, a decent khaki head that dies to a small film, laces ok. Aromas are riasted malts, biscuits, aa touch of anise, vanilla, coffee. Pretty big bite of toasty biscuits. Initial is lighter bodied, some decent toasty bread, toasted biscuits, touches of roasted malts, cocoa, smoothed on vanilla, creaminess. Aa bit harsh, touches of roasty grains really stick to the palate, burnt toast, cocoa, coffee. Very nice, I get a weird anise vibe jumping in and out lightly, that I’m not a huge fan of. But overall, it’s a tasty light bodied roasty lager, with touches of cocoa, anise, and vanilla, some coffee, and a lot of toast and biscuits. Mild bitterness, really tries to emphasize it’s roast despite it’s light body
Goose Island Schwarzbier;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Brown-black in color, she sports slivers of amber and garnet when held up to light while soft khakis adorn her head. No lace, though she does have a lingering penchant for khaki fluff. Her nose is a pleasant mix of coffee, licorice, prunes, burnt wood, caramel, bakers chocolate, and raisins. There is an afterthought of smoke in her roasty banquet which is just the way I like my Schwarze beers: roasty, dark, dry, and replete with burnt sweetness. Wasting no time at all, I dive thirstily into her awaiting depths to discover a medium-light body. Immediately roasty and smoky, her finish is bitter with coffee and espresso crema which also highlights burnt caramel sweetness. Bakers chocolate and dry European chocolates permeate her palate while dark fruits are found lounging in the middle with plums, raisins, and prunes. Wood crackles in the fireplace while toast browns in the oven, and I am right back where I started. Quaff and repeat. Amazing sessionability along with great flavors that both quench my thirst and induce it. A solid Schwarzbier from Goose Island Clybourn.
Goose Island Schwarzbier;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap. Dark brown-to-black pour. Malty / roasty nose. Taste is mild roast, a little sweetness, and somewhat dry. Decent brew.
Goose Island Schwarzbier;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at the Clybourne location. Deep black/brown pour. Nose is lightly roasty with some unusual sort of vegetal character. A little bit of cocoa and a bit of earthiness. Sort of an herbal root beer/cola sort of flavour. Quite unusual. It’s not bad, but it’s nothing to write home about either.
Goose Island Schwarzbier;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at Clybourn. Pours a deep chestnut/black. Nose is rich, slightly burnt and roasty. Taste is very close to a porter, though a little lighter bodied and cleaner. Nice roastiness to it without the acrid notes. Finish is clean and dry. Nice example.
Goose Island Schwarzbier;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap from Goose Island pub in Wrigleyville.

Pours a medium opaque, light amber color with a good, compact white head that lingers. Good lacing is left behind. Aroma is fully sweet with little hop balance. Light bodied. Flavor runs the same as aroma. Sweet dominated with the malt, just slightly crisp and no hop balance. Fair at best.
Jersey Shore Gold;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;Not a beer that needs to be explained in great detail. Light, crisp,slight hoppyness. A nice summer brew. Nothing to rant and rave about.
Jersey Shore Gold;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy, murky gold with an almost non-existant head. Aromas of lemon, corn, grain and fresh dough. Palate very flat. Flavor presents with a weird, distracting sourness behind the overall sweet profile. Some lemon, bready and honey notes come through. Not all that good, and I’ve got 5 more to drink.
Jersey Shore Gold;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;Pours with a somewhat cloudy/murkey golden with a a white head that dissapates almost immediately. Aroma is grainy with a hint of apple. Flavor has notes of sweet malt, corn, grain and a touch of lemon and grass. Not much bitterness at all, sweet. Medium body, smooth texture and lively carbonation. Not that good, and I’m from Jersey.
Jersey Shore Gold;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;Jersey Gold in the House. State brew of the greatest state. Unfortunately, not that great a beer. Maybe the bugs floating in mine did not help (flew into my glass and died without me noticing it), but this one had a bad aftertaste and little good beforetaste.
Jersey Shore Gold;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy medium golden with a decent sized white head - good bubble action.

John Harvards Pure Pilsen;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at Framingham location: poured golden yellow with a thin white head.

John Harvards Pure Pilsen;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);"2004 draught @ Framingham location. Well, it’s almost certainly not the same beer Volgon had, but the one I had, which the bartender called, ""Pilsener"", is a pilsener, not a bohemian or classic german, so I will just rate it here. I just don’t have the heart to add a new beer to the already ungodly long and confusing list of john harvard beers. Ahem, anyways, this was a damn good pils from start to finish. Good mildly hazy yellow/hay golden color, small white head. Aroma has plenty of saaz hops, light citrus notes and some sweet malt. Flavor is lightly spicy, sweet, but not overly so and well hopped. Crisp and very bitter on the finish, though not unbalanced. Served cold and well-appreciated that way. This was about the most refreshing beer I’ve had in a long time. No thinning, no off-flavors. Good body, light carbonation and well-balanced with ample use of hops. Slightly sour yeast notes in the middle that don’t quite work, but that was one of the few problems."
John Harvards Pure Pilsen;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap 7/6/02 in Cambridge, MA: Light yellow color, ends slightly bitter. About as bland as beer gets.

Royal Duffer Golf Society Premium Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;I got the sensation in both the aroma and flavor that there was some kind of wet, musty, moldy paper in my beer. Pretty damned awful and hard enough to choke down.
Royal Duffer Golf Society Premium Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Bottled from Big Lots. Pours a medium golden color with no head to speak of. This has a malty sort of cidery aroma. Some soapiness as well. Very bready flavors. Some graininess. Not very good. At least it was only 2 bucks a 4-pack. This pretty much blows goats.
Royal Duffer Golf Society Premium Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Had at friend who bought at Trader Joes, just sugar water with light carbonation.

Royal Duffer Golf Society Premium Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;It has the aroma of an ale. It beats the ---- out of the standard American lagers. But ... down the drain. Can’t believe this is a Coast Range ale.
Royal Duffer Golf Society Premium Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Pours gold with big, bubbly head. Malty nose and watery finish. I have never brewed a batch of beer but I would bet I could brew this style better than these duffers.
Royal Duffer Golf Society Premium Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Hints of honey, lemon, and plastic abound, with a hazy yellow glow that carries quite a bit of suspended particles. There is very little here to speak of, just a very bland ordinary ale. If this is premium, I'd hate to taste the regular stuff.
Royal Duffer Golf Society Premium Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;surprised me. i expected to spit it out really fast. malty, very high carbonation, i think they made it with some of the grass from the golf course. and i am glad i didnt pay for it.

Łomża Lider;Łomża, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Łomża (Van Pur);Golden with a quick, white head that settled to a scummy film. Grainy, lightly roasted, with sour fruit, almost sour milk. Dusty, floral hops late. First mouthful was as metallic as the fender off a Buick. After some opening up, a roasted malt character came out with light bittering. Could not detect the breadiness that was supposed to surface... maybe dark, dry toast. Intermittent sweetness made things interesting, but some metallic notes also surfaced to cancel out the fun. Bridgeview Liquors, Bridgeview, IL
Łomża Lider;Łomża, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Łomża (Van Pur);Straw colored, lazily carbonated, and capped with a tall bubbly head, this brew has an aroma of sweet, doughy malts with perhaps a dwash of floral hops. Light bodied, it has a soft sweet malt flavor with a barely discernable hop taste. Clean finish. Okay, but basically uninteresting.
Łomża Lider;Łomża, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Łomża (Van Pur);BIG tall white head that lasts for ever.Very light golden straw color.light carbonation.Malty sweet aroma,some hops,and like Venom said an almost bread like smell,unbaked bread dough is more like it.some very faint hints of citrus as well.Very mild brew light to nearly no carbonation,mildly sweet,lightly malty,Mildly hopped.Very light feel in the mouth,slightly sweet,hoppy after taste that fades fast to nothing.Over all it's not a bad brew at all could use some more carbonation and maybe just a bit larger hop presence to bring this one closer to what it is supposed to be.
Łomża Lider;Łomża, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Łomża (Van Pur);Clear golden straw with some fine particles. Thin bubbly white head. Trace carbonation. Light toasted bread aroma mixed with soft hops. Clean and medium bodied. Faintly sweet yet mildly hoppy. Easy drinking and not very complex. Loses some flavor mid ground. Finishes sweeter and soft and slightly fuller. Definately well made, just aimed for the light beer drinker. Overall a very respectable brew.

Fortuna Hell;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Hasen Bräu (Hasenbräu);Picked this beer up on my Munich tour. The beer pours a clear golden color with a thick white head that dissipated rather quickly. The aroma is white bread, sweet malts, and a mild hop presence. The taste has a mild hop kick up front and finishes on a bready malty side. The mouthfeel is light. Out of all the beers from Munich I have tried this has been my least favorite but that doesn't mean it's a horrible beer.

De Ranke Kriek;Dottignies, Belgium;Sour / Wild Beer - Flavored;Brouwerij De Ranke;Pours a cloudy, ruby red coloration with a medium, quickly dissipating, fluffy, pink'ish head. Smells of sweet and tart red cherries, citrus acidity and just a hint of funk and earthy/musty oak. Taste is a great balance of mellow, sweet and tart red cherries, but really more tart than sweet, with a light citric acidity and very light, but noticeable funk, as well as just a hint of earthy/musty and lightly tannic oak. Finishes with a light tartness and acidity and some cherries and oak lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. This is a really nice and mellow Kriek that's a blend of Flemish Sour Ale and Lambic, giving this a milder tartness with just a hint of funk, which makes for a rather mellow balance with a great, refreshing drinkability that totally makes up for the lack of complexity if that's what you're in the mood for on a hot summer's day. Very nice balance of sweet and sour notes as well, with the sour notes staying firmly on top, never letting this become too sweet.

Special Alken Blonde;Alken, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken);Thanks for sharing Gabriel. Pours a crystal clear dull hay color with minimal head. Smells like beer water - a touch a malt and hops. Actually has a bit more flavor than the smell. Sweet up front, a bit of artificial sweetener but not anything else going on. Ends slightly dry. Watery, light body with mild carbonation....unfortunately nothing positive going on at all.
Special Alken Blonde;Alken, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken);75cl-bottle. Hellgelb im Glas, kaum stabiler Schaum. Der Geruch ist sehr neutral. Im Antrunk ist das Bier süßlich, stark wässrig. Zum Hauptteil kommt eine leicht herbe Note hinzu, die süßstoffgeprägte Süße kann aber nicht über die penetrante Wässrigkeit hinwegtäuschen. Der Nachgeschmack ist fast nicht vorhanden, ein ganz wenig süßlich-herb, aber halt süßstoff-chemisch. --> one of the most boring and watery blond tablebeers I came across!!
Special Alken Blonde;Alken, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken);At the hospital. Seems patients can’t get better... Yellow-golden coloured.

Special Alken Blonde;Alken, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken);Blond with low alcohol. Sweet flavor, fruit notes. In palate the swetness dominates the taste and nothing to tell about hops. I am not going to repeat this beer.

Honkers Red Ale;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;August Schell Brewing Company;this is a good beer. moderate and quality mouthfeel flavors of true beer and quality finish. best lower alcohol beer i ever tried. thanx for the hit wyatt!!! very nice multidimensional hop flavor and really good malt backdrop. perfume and floral and still not sucky.
Honkers Red Ale;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;August Schell Brewing Company;Drank massive quantities of this stuff at the Rochester Honkers baseball game. Real good for a red (generally not a big fan of the style), malty but with enough hop presence to be interesting. Great mouthfeel and balance. Get it if you can find it.
Honkers Red Ale;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;August Schell Brewing Company;"On tap at the Parkway Pub in Lanesboro, MN. Here they call the beer ""Schell’s Rosie’s Red."" Thanks to Wawood for tipping us to the Brewer’s practice of selling this to bars and allowing them to name it what they wish. Reddish amber with a white head. Floral aroma. Very sweet, but finishes tart. Thin body. Kind of like an apple soda pop."
Honkers Red Ale;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;August Schell Brewing Company;"I have had this several times over the years going to Honkers’ games, but never got around to rating it. I had it last night, and I’ll have to tell you that it is much improved from the tinny, bland slightly roasted malt beverage it used to be. It is still malt dominated, but is fuller in body with no noticeable flaws. It has a nice amber body with lots of carbonation flowing up to the head, which is a creamy off-white. A faint touch of hops is a nice touch, although more would be welcome. To my knowledge, this is supposed to be 3.2% ABV in order to comply with a MN liscense to serve beer at a ballpark, but I have to believe this is more. I’m guessing Schell accidentally slipped them a stronger keg of the stuff. This is apparently referred to as ""Schell Amber"" at the brewery and is supposedly their ""house brew"" that they provide to multiple establishments who can rename it as their own."
Honkers Red Ale;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;August Schell Brewing Company;This manages to be a lighter beer appropriate for watching a baseball game, while having enough body to be of interest to the serious beer drinking. A little on the sweet side, but not too sweet, with an excellent head and wonderful aroma.

Pizza Port Switch Stance Strong Ale;Carlsbad, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);"A strong ale nonetheless with nothing really going for it other than the alcohol content.

The alcohol is well balanced and hiddem but at the expense of the flavor which isn;t anything special, but still decent."
Pizza Port Switch Stance Strong Ale;Carlsbad, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Orange skin water lilies floating on the lightened sweet cherry juice of a suave and plump malty body…Peppery, resinous hops appear towards the end but the malty rotundity recaptures its encapsulating hold on the tongue…A definite change of pace on the malt side of things for this Carlsbad brewer (at least, what I know of his stuff) and a portly portent of generosity…
Pizza Port Switch Stance Strong Ale;Carlsbad, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);"(Draft: Pizza Port in Carlsbad, CA) Holy shit! Nobody light a match! Switch Stance is back on tap in Carlsbad, but this beer is extremely hot; I love high octane beers, but this 9% strong ale smells, tastes and feels like hard liquor and is hard going down; Looking beyond the alcoholic bite, the massive flavor is malty, very fruity, very sweet, and sharply bitter and hoppy, especially in the finish that goes on and on and on; The nose is sweet and very hoppy like a barleywine; Thick, heavy, very sweet and sticky on the palate, but the harsh alcoholic mouthfeel is difficult to deal with; Deep red in color; Tan head is very small on the pour and thins to a sheen very quickly, however the ring leaves some modest lacing; This beer is just way too hot, and deserves another try at a later date"

Pizza Port Switch Stance Strong Ale;Carlsbad, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);"Switch Stance (a surfing term) pours a dark amber color. It has some light hoppiness up front with a malty finish. The nose is rich and malty. Today is a warm day; I think this brew would be better suited for a cooler day. It's a nice example of a strong ale"

Birra Moretti Sans Souci Export;Milano, Italy;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Heineken Italia;Labelled as a helles, but tasting like a premium lager.

Цвет красивый, пенка неплохая, держится долго. Вкус уже больше напоминает заявленный стиль. Пиво в целом питкое, карбонизация небольшая. Все еще ощущается небольшие кислые нотки от яблок и сухофруктов. После, появляются карамельные составляющие от солода. При глотке легкая кислинка, ощущается слива и винные нотки от красного вина. В целом отличное пиво для данного стиля, минус только в одном, все нотки ощущаются не слишком сильно.

Empire Apricot Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Empire Brewing Company;Fruity... I was not sure if this was the apricot at first. Van was pretty sure it is... Matt and I concurred that it was better than the McAuslan's Apricot Wheat we had in Toronto. Light body, decent amount of fruit flavour.
Empire Apricot Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Empire Brewing Company;Another seasonal. Id rather have an apricot wheat from Ithaca, but this is ok. Too much fizziness and a very light body are a problem. but its not bad for the attempt. Good subtle flavor. nice summer light beer for sitting outside on the deck.
Empire Pumpkin Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Empire Brewing Company;2002 vintage on draft: This is one of my favorite beers from Empire. Of course I’m biased because I used to work for them. Great aroma of pumpkin and spice, reminds me of pumpkin pie. Tastes very similar to pumpkin pie, nice light spice, cloves, very drinkable. Great fall beer, though not always as good every year. Too bad they stopped making it and later went out of business.
Empire Pumpkin Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Empire Brewing Company;Nice pumpkiny flavor but not as spicy as McAuslan's pumpkin. It was good, but would have been even better with a bit more of the pumpkin pie spices.
Empire Pumpkin Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Empire Brewing Company;I think this is my favorite of their seasonal beers. Problem is, they dont always get it right when they brew it. Ive had some batches that were incredible and others that were just mediocre. A very subtle pumpkin taste that tastes fresh. No heavy malty/spiciness to complicate things, just a good amber ale with some good pumpkin flavor for the holidays.
Empire Pumpkin Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Empire Brewing Company;An interesting beer. I had this a while ago, it had a flavor of pumpkin with a small hint of clove. A good beer to go with a hearty meal.
Empire Black Raspberry;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Empire Brewing Company;Terrible. Im not sure if I could have discerned this from a black raspberry soda in a blind taste test.
Empire Mai Bock;Syracuse, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Empire Brewing Company;From 2003: I see clarkvv is the only other person to rate this, and I’m pretty sure I first tried this beer with him at Empire. Very lots of alcohol, very malty, with some pepper and other spices. Some hops come through as well, though not much, and almost balance it out. Very crisp.
Empire Mai Bock;Syracuse, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Empire Brewing Company;2002 draught.The ABV was either 10% or 11% cant remember which. the Doppelbock had 10 or 11 too. anyways this was a great experiment and a great beer. Malty and a little spicy, this has got to be your pick if you like bocks. they were sellin these things for 2 bucks a pint!!! 2003 production. Damn! they do a good job at perfecting their beers here. This was improved from the last season I had it. Less spice and sweetness leave room for more hops and malt. I especially liked the addition of the hops in this season. The alcohol taste is less present and does not knock you out at all, though it is there. Also characteristic of Empire, this beer was exceptional fresh tasting. Body is medium and goes down easier than expected.
Empire Steam Beer;Syracuse, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Empire Brewing Company;Summer 2003: An average steam beer that tasted better because it was fresh. Some good malt and bitter hops in the nose and taste, as previously mentioned not a very balanced finish.
Empire Steam Beer;Syracuse, New York, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Empire Brewing Company;this one was ok. not too bad seeing as how they dont sell anchor steam at the brewpub. Ok malt character, a bit too sour for my liking, and somewhat unbalanced in the finish.

Valhalla Hefe-Weizen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Valhalla Microbrewery & Restaurant;Big banana flavor--all over the place. Hazy yellow, not hyper-vigorous carbonation yet not exactly smooth. Not bad, if you like bananas.
Valhalla Hefe-Weizen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Valhalla Microbrewery & Restaurant;heavy wheat beer. very cloudly yellowish beer that LOOKS like a wheat beer. Slight citrus taste with a heavy finish
Valhalla Hefe-Weizen;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Valhalla Microbrewery & Restaurant;hazy yellow wheat. the wheat and yeast tastes dominate giving this strong cloive and banana notes. unlike most wheats this beer actually benefits from the the lemon wedge which neutralizes the strong clove taste. light palate and sweet taste make this a pleasant beer to have on the outdoor deck.
Hanlon's Yellowhammer;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hanlon's Brewery;cask at Maltsters Arms, Tuckenhay. Nil aroma. Medium gold. Thinnest of translucent white heads. Barely there. Some vague sweet edged citrus starts off proceedings but it amounts to very little. Bitterness does kick in once we're heading into the finish alongside some herby umami but by then it's too late. Thin. Light. Average carbonation. Long dry finish. Yes, it's sort of yellow but, no, this isn't going to be hammering anyone or anything. Dull Gold.

O'Hanlon's Blakeley's No.1;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hanlon's Brewery;"Russet colour; earthy hops, moderately bitter. Touch of caramel, dried peaches, tobacco, fairly quenching finish, but it was a sunny August afternoon in London."

I actually liked this the best out of the O'Hanlons brews i tried. Very aromatic hops in the nose, with a nice burnt malt nose aswell. Heaps of roasty malt flavours, coupled with juicy, grapefruity, citric hops, pretty solid i think.

Slightly cloudy amber colour with small to average, frothy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, off-white head. Minimally sweet-ish, grainy protein aroma, a spicy touch of hay.

Hereford & Hops Piva Bohemian Pilsner;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap at the brewpub, Escanaba. Clear straw body, thin tight off-white head. Floral nose with notes of clover honey. Body with light fruit (pear), honey, and grassy bitterness, somewhat tangy and phenolic. Not very impressive.
Hereford & Hops Piva Bohemian Pilsner;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;"On draught at the Wausau brewpub location as ""Piva Bohemian Pilsner."" Pours a clear golden pale brew with a slowly dissolving white head that leaves behind some excellent lacing and good retention with plenty of carbonation bubbles. Aroma of light pear and apple juice fruit, grassy hops, and some mild earthy spice. Taste is light to medium bodied, plenty of carbonation with flavors of light golden grain malt, some grassy hops with a touch of medicinal bitterness. Finish is semi-dry, mild bitterness that slowly disappears."
Hereford & Hops Piva Bohemian Pilsner;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Tried as Panther Pils in Cranberry. Pours a golden orange color with very little head. I got a little bit of hops and sweetness in the nose, but the person next to me was smoking, so it was difficult to discern. Had kind of an earthiness to the nose. It tasted exactly how it smelled: earthy hops with just a touch of sweetness. Had a lot of carbonation, but lacked much body. I’m not a fan of pilsners so this might be why I rated so low.
Hereford & Hops Piva Bohemian Pilsner;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap at Cranberry as the Panther Pils. Slight fruity aroma. Ubiquitous aamerican pale yellow beer color and appearance. Has that typical pils bite. Very little carbonation. Overall a decent pilsner with a little personality. Finish is relatively clean and fresh with a short pils bite that fades rapidly.
Hereford & Hops Piva Bohemian Pilsner;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;12/27/07 - Winter Road Trip ’07 - Draft Sample in Cranberry as Panther Pils. Pours yellow-orange with little head. Slight lacing. Malt nose, caramel, touch of hops. Barely discernible from sample. Caramel and toffee notes, dry bitterness and slight Earthy hop flavor. Pretty smooth beer, thin and lacking in the body department, much like Calista Flockhart. Bready notes, some biscuit. Not bad.
Hereford & Hops Piva Bohemian Pilsner;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap in Cranberry as Panther Pils. Noble hops aroma, mild pils malt with characteristic sweet grain nose. Meium gold-amber clear with thin white head. Medium body with medium-high carbonation. Starts with acidic beany tang, pils malt, and strong floral noble hops. Classic European style lager, not quite a German pils. Acidic carbonic burn on the tongue.
Hereford & Hops Piva Bohemian Pilsner;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Pours straw yellow with white head. Aroma of corn, grain, light malt and light hops. Flavor is lame american macro. Not cool. So not cool.
Hereford & Hops Piva Bohemian Pilsner;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Not real impressed with this beer. It’s the clostest thing to a maro brew on their menu, which means it’s made for the masses rather then individual tastes. Not bad, but nothing special
Hereford & Hops Piva Bohemian Pilsner;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Had this one on draught in Wausau, Wisconsin. Pale yellow in color, clear and bubbly, this one tastes only slightly better than your average american macrobrew, with corn and rice in the nose and no taste. This is why I can’t stand pilseners.
Hereford & Hops Piva Bohemian Pilsner;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Left me wanting a bit more. Kind of bitter, strong. Golden, not much froth. I brought my drink up to the grill area, warmed it up a bit too fast. By the time my steak was done, this pils was rather warm, my fault.
Hereford & Hops Hop Rocket Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;[Growler] shared by Skyview. Clear gold pour with a soapy off white head. Grassy aroma. Not overpowering hops, citrus, and grapefruit. Medium mouthfeel, with a nice, but not quite enough, hop quality.
Hereford & Hops Hop Rocket Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;From Skyview’s growler. Bitter, grassy hops. Orange color. Thin white head and light red color. A session beer with very low bitterness, not bad at all for what it is.
Hereford & Hops Hop Rocket Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;(growler from Skyview) Pours orange with a white head. Aroma has some pepper, citrus, and some graniness too. Taste is pretty weak with some light sweetness, very light hops, and a strong grainy finish. Medium mouthfeel.
Hereford & Hops Hop Rocket Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Copper color with a thin head. Light orange aroma. Fairly grainy taste and a bitter, slightly acidic finish. Just a bit of orange flavor.
Hereford & Hops Hop Rocket Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;A very hoppy and delicous beer for an amber. Aroma was a little weak but was all hops. Pour was a nice medium brown (dark for an amber) with a one finger off white head. Taste was a little thin in the front. Just barely a hint of caramel malt that, after the swallow bombards the tongue and throat with hop bitterness. Dry and bitter as it goes down. Very tasty and extreme for an amber ale.
Hereford & Hops Hop Rocket Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Nice beer! Didn’t expect this from my local brewpub. Drank this with an Englishman, and he commented on how well it would go over in the UK. Keep up the good work!! Nice floral hops, not overly hoppy, but just enough to keep the beer going.
Hereford & Hops Hop Rocket Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;12/27/07 - Winter Road Trip ’07 - Draft sample at brewpub. Clear red/amber, thin white head w/ good lacing. Great floral nose, fruity as all can be. Tastes fruity and floral hoptasticness up front, some caramel, then a good earthy bitterness. Pretty dry. Not a bad bitter offering. Pretty one dimensional, all hops and some malt. Not overpowering. Tasty and sessionable.
Hereford & Hops Hop Rocket Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap. Great hop aroma, orange peel and grapefruit, sweet brown sugar malt. Deep amber-orange clear with off-white foamy laing head. Medium waery body with light carbonation. Starts with mild sweet maltiness and fruity fresh hops. Dies away quickly to a medium chalky bitterness and tongue-coating dry nutty after.
Hereford & Hops Hop Rocket Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Pours amber red with very little head. Sweet maltiness and some floral hops in the nose. A well-balanced beer. Sweet malt, maybe some caramel and the bitter hop flavor doesn’t really make itself known until the finish, which is kind of a citrus bitterness.
Hereford & Hops Hop Rocket Ale;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On draught at the brewpub in Wausau, Wisconsin. Pours a clear copper penny amber brew with a creamy white head that has good retention and thick lacing. Aroma of light white bread malt, some herbs and plenty of grapefruit zest with piney hops. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with strong citrus/pine flavors that over-powers any malt flavors. Finish is quite bitter, with a lingering grapefruit zest aftertaste that makes this more like an IPA than an American Pale Ale.
Hereford & Hops St. Edmunds Porter;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Porter;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Creamy, with 70% nitro. Dark, a bit of roast aroma. But not much left in the taste, a tad of roasted walnut maybe. No coffee nor chocolate. Thinner than I would like. Was not as drinkable
Hereford & Hops St. Edmunds Porter;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Porter;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Another treat that went well with my steak. Nice beige head sat atop the almost jet black beer. Nuts, coffee, and hops came together well with a creamy mouthfeel.
Hereford & Hops St. Edmunds Porter;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Porter;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;A delightful seasonal. Quite dark (black), lots of coffee, decent head, great finish.
Hereford & Hops St. Edmunds Porter;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Porter;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;"An outstanding offering from the folks at H&H. The main regret is that this is a stated seasonal and therefore not available year-round. Rich roasted coffee aroma. Dark brown, almost black body; tan, medium head with decent retention. As my sample was one of 4 served on H&H's outdoor patio in Wausau, WI on a hot, humid summer day, by the time I got to the porter, it had warmed considerably. It still was quite flavorful. I imagine even more enjoyable at slightly cooler than room temp."
Draught House Century Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Pretty solid beer. Dark, roasty, chocolately stout, if not a tad thin for as strong as it was. Slight bit of alcohol character but not dominating or overbearing. Enjoyable.
Draught House Century Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Draught House Pub & Brewery;(draught) jet black pour, light tan head that laces Very well. Nose of vanilla, bourbon, coffee, sweet chocolate. Delicious nose. Taste of coffee, bitter dark chocolate, vanilla and somewhat syrupy. Very thick medium body, creamy, bitter chocolate notes and sweet finish. Excellent!
Draught House Century Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Draught House Pub & Brewery;On tap at the Draught House. Pours neer black and came to me with very little head. Aromas is roasty, day old coffee and some smoke(?). Flavor is roasty, moderate hop bitter, fresh coffee and mild sweetness. Nice medium coffee (hops too) bitter ending. Medium to thick/full mouthfeel. Alcohol is well concealed. Not too complex, but a very drinkable semi-impy.
Draught House Century Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Draught at the Draught House- poured a solid and mean black color, thin brown head formed and tried it’s best to lace. Aroma of a roasted malt, smoke, and got a little earth for some reason. Hits the mouth with a high-medium body, malt was nicely roasted and full, coffee with a tiny note of sweetness in the middle, finish is lasting and acidic from hops.
Draught House Century Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Draught House Pub & Brewery;The beer pours black with a brown head. The aroma is roasted malt with some nice smoke. The flavor is roasted malt, smoke, coffee and citrus hops. The hops really come in strong at the end of the flavor. The alcohol is pretty well hidden. Creamy, medium-thick mouthfeel and low carbonation.
Draught House Century Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Pours mahogany dark brown with a 2 inch maple nut brown head before Amy pours it off to give you a full pint. The aroma is rich with coffee, spice, dark wood, and delicious anticipation. The flavor is full and powerful with dark rasted bareley malt flavor dominating. The head is an intricate weave of dense rich foam. The lacing is intricate and very heavy. The pleasure is near immeasureable. Just kiddding, but it is good. Texture is thick and characteristic of a stout. Finish is a little creamy, tart, and bitter. Did I mention this beer has a veryr tart and bittersweet finish.
Draught House Century Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Draught House Pub & Brewery;An imperial with a decent amount of complexity. The nitrogen produced fake head was pretty, but it gave the stout an undesired over-creaminess. Good overall, and it hides the alcohol well.
Draught House Century Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Draught House Pub & Brewery;"Completely opaque black color, tan head that had incredibly tiny bubbles and a smooth, spongy surface. You know how sometimes the smell or flavor of a beer brings to mind a phrase, like Abbaye de Floreffe Meilleure makes me think of ""dark bananas""? All I could think of in the smell was the phrase ""weak hops"". The flavor, however, was rather complex. I got: chocolate, licoriche, alcohol, grapes, and some whiskey toward the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit too smooth, almost slimy...plus, the effect on my palate wasn't nearly as ruinous as a stout should be. This beer had a lot of pros and cons and it was difficult to evaluate how I felt about it overall. The complexity of the flavor carried it despite its other shortcomings."
Draught House Century Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout - Imperial;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Decent imperial....needed a bit more effervescence. Good flavor but the flavors were not as distinguishable as in other good stouts (like the imperial across town at the Bitter End). I didnt like the nitro head either...gave the beer an annoying creaminess. Decent....period.
Breckenridge SummerBright Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);This is a backlog rating from 2007 from a bottle, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are pale wheat malts, lemony citrus, thin.
Breckenridge SummerBright Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);$1.99 bottle from World Market. Pours slightly hazy golden with a tiny white head. Aroma is slightly moldy hay, wheat, grass, cheap lager. Taste is a watery wheat/lemon/hay mixture. Flavor disappears quickly, which I suppose isn’t a bad thing.
Breckenridge SummerBright Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Poured from bottle...too much lemon...i guess it is refreshing...pretty lame brew.

Breckenridge SummerBright Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Pours a clear gold with no head. A strong malt and grain aroma. A malt and grain taste with some citrus. A dry malt and grain aftertaste.
Breckenridge SummerBright Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);It’s beer, but not a very good one. Too much lemon gets this beer off balance. Clear yellow color, poor smell, no palate.
Breckenridge SummerBright Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);On Tap at Tully’s. I thought this was better than an 18 - that’s Bud Light territory. It had a few redeeming qualities such as it’s appearance and it was drinkable and mostly inoffensive as most summer beers are. Why the unwritten beer rule that in the summer we have to drink low ABV watery stuff? I still want Imperial Stouts, Barleywines and DIPAs.
Breckenridge SummerBright Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Tasting flight at the taproom in Denver. A matte light gold with a crackery pale malt aroma. The body is rough and raspy. The taste is sweet, sugary with adjunct like malting. Not for me.
Breckenridge SummerBright Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Pours a hazy, light gold color. Half finger head, at most. No lacing. No retention. Nothing to say. Aroma is not much. You can smell the wheat in this, there’s no question about it. But there is some orange peel and that’s about it. Taste is watery. It tastes like a wheat beer, but not a great one. It’s mildly citrusy. Barely any hops, if any. I’ve had tap water that has more taste than this. Mouthfeel is very light and watery. Perhaps you could call it a light wheat beer. It’s a good summer beer. Light, refreshing. Overall, this is not so great. Is it a radler? Could be. Is it terrible? No. Is it amazing? No. Is it refreshing? Yes! So, it’s a great summer beer, but so is Bud Light. Honestly, I would take this over Bud Light, but only barely, maybe.
Breckenridge SummerBright Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle from Beer and Wine. Light golden body with fast-receding head. Nose is sweet, floral, honey. Taste is very light, quite dissapointing actually, of lemon, some wheat and hops. Not much to it. Unfortunately.
Malzinger Helles;St.Pölten, Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Malzinger Stadtbräu;Tangerine aroma. Hazy, golden colour, fair lace. Fruity and flowery. Little grapefruit in the finish. Didn't quite know how to rate this one. Had some homebrew character but still I liked it.

Hollande 1620 Lager Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);12oz bottle - Boy, you could really do much worse than this but Big Lots! practically gives this stuff way, it’s a good BBQ beer when the fire just wants to be quenched. Aroma is mildly skunky, decent yeasty-bread aroma mixed with apple juice. Light grass (really light), just a touch of sweet corn. Pretty unoffensive actually. Drinkable.
Hollande 1620 Lager Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Ok i bought atleast a 36 pack of theses they were on sale at foodsco aka kroger idk how much a 6pack but cheap honestly i like it better than Heineken can’t believe it was that cheap has a after bitter taste but for the price allot better than bud wiser/light and low end beers.. like most said has a grassy smell to it not bad at all. I would give this beer a 4.5 for the price and taste.
Hollande 1620 Lager Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);500ml can pours a pale golden color with a finger of white head that settles quickly leaving a few specks of lacing on the glass. Aroma is grassy with some cereal grains. Taste is malty sweet with a grassy hop bitterness with a light skunkiness. Light bodied with some mild carbonation. A typical macro style lager, but one of the better ones.
Hollande 1620 Lager Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);11.2 fl oz bottle. Totally clear pale yellow color, minimal head. Mildly skunky, yeasty aroma. A bit over carbonated. Light sour aftertaste. However, better than Heineken IMO, and can’t argue with the $4/6 price.
Hollande 1620 Lager Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);This beer is a typical beer from Holland. It doesn’t taste real spectacular. Use your money to buy a lottery ticket when you come across this beer.
Hollande 1620 Lager Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Purchased at a grocery store in eastern Tennessee because I had never seen it before. Pours a clear pale yellow color with fizzy white head. Skunky pungent saaz hop aroma with corny sweetness. Flavor sweet base, bit of a dry finish, grassy notes. Overall, decent typical euro lager, but nothing really unique.
Hollande 1620 Lager Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);A crisp pils aroma. The flavor is also dry and crisp but has some butter notes up front that really drag it down.
Hollande 1620 Lager Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);"Basically identical to Heineken, maybe a little better; it’s definitely better than the typical American macro lager. Very slight grassy/hay aroma and flavor. Nothing special and very forgettable."
Hollande 1620 Lager Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Pours a clean golden color with a cream-white head. Aroma is light and crisp with no discernible singularities. Flavor is crisp clean and light. Certainly not bad, just not much there. This is probably what bud light wants to taste light. Not great, but easy-drinking.
Hollande 1620 Lager Bier;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Clear, yellow, good head. A lot of skunk which is a shame - there’s plenty of malt flavor back there that might otherwise make this one an almost decent beer. Even the finish is nicely bitter. But oh - the skunk...

Waddenbier Blond (Wattenbier Hell);Bolsward, Netherlands;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Friese Bierbrouwerij;Bottle in Schierminnekoog. Actually enjoyed this much more than the `Spelt’ version. Lots of flavor, crisp and smoother. Not a great beer but nice micro one.
Waddenbier Blond (Wattenbier Hell);Bolsward, Netherlands;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Friese Bierbrouwerij;Hoppy and yeasty aroma. Smells rotten or chemical. Cloudy orange coloured, not much head. Taste is very flowery and hoppy. Sweet. Bitter in the end. Not really great.

Zhujiang 10°;Guangzhou, Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou Zhujiang Brewery Group Co. Ltd;As Pearl River 10P. 3.6%. Found in Guilin. Golden colour with no head and low carbonation. The aroma has lots of pears and some sulphur. Juicy Asian pear character, with decent body for its size. Sweetish finish. Ok swill.
Zhujiang 10°;Guangzhou, Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou Zhujiang Brewery Group Co. Ltd;Enjoyed illegally while strolling around the Shamian neighborhood of Guangzhou, China. Nevertheless, it still tasted kinda bad. It’s redeeming quality is that it wasn’t overly fizzy. Otherwise, it’s exactly the sort of rice-based, hop-free beer you’d expect. Maybe a touch sweet.

Zhujiang 10°;Guangzhou, Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou Zhujiang Brewery Group Co. Ltd;(04.08.06) 640 mL green bottle purchased at Deli shop next the White Swan Hotel, Guangzhou, China.. 10oP. 3.6% ABV. Bottled labeled as 9/05-0/08. Poured clear straw colored with large short lived white head. Sweetish skunk aroma. Light bodied that starts with light malt sweetness and corn flavor. Finished dry and clean. Watery and thin. No discernable hop presence. A typical generic Chinese lager. Nothing particularly memorable about this beer except that it was nearly tasteless. Sister beers Zhujiang 12 P and Pearl River 11 P were slightly better in the flavor department.
Zhujiang 10°;Guangzhou, Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou Zhujiang Brewery Group Co. Ltd;Can. Very pale, head comes and goes fast. This has a very weird latex and tangerine-ish quality that just doesn’t go with the underlying adjuncts. A rather awful effort.
Zhujiang 10°;Guangzhou, Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou Zhujiang Brewery Group Co. Ltd;(Bottle 64 cl) Very pale, very light, nice little head and rather high carbonation.

Zhujiang 10°;Guangzhou, Guangdong, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guangzhou Zhujiang Brewery Group Co. Ltd;Bottle. I think this must be the lightest coloured beer I’ve ever seen - like water with a dash of lemon in it. Incidently, lemon is found in the aroma, along with a sour skunkiness. Also, it seems to have a faint note of this coffee my grandmother used to drink, called ’soft java’. I rather liked the smell of the coffee, but it doesn’t really do anything for me in this case. Flavour is very thin. Has apple notes and a slight citrusy bitterness. A bit metallic. Not at all a good beer. Makes you wonder why this crap comes in 640 ml. bottles. I also have a Zhujiang 12* waiting for me... I must admit I’m not exactly trembling with excitement at this moment.

Wojak Pilsener;Kielce, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Browar Kielce (Kompania Piwowarska - SABMiller);(Bottled, BBE 03/2006, 4.1% ABV) Clear golden color with a smallish head leaving some lace behind. Mild, grassy-buttery, slightly stingy-hoppy aroma. Somewhat bitter and quite acidic, lemony and lightly malty flavor. Very faint, acidic finish with very little hop bite. Quite light-bodied, fizzy and very carbonated palate. Not among the most sophisticated pilseners, yet mostly drinkable. The acidic, light and fizzy palate is quite a turn-down, though.
Wojak Pilsener;Kielce, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Browar Kielce (Kompania Piwowarska - SABMiller);Ugh, this isn’t good. The average look (golden colour, bubbly disappearing head) is the best thing about ths one. Well, maybe also the fact that it doesn’t smell bad until drank. The taste is horrid - no signs of malt, hops or whatever, but extremely sour (not fruity, mind you). Just as if someone poured juice straight from a lemon of low quality. No aftertaste, fortunately. It looks like a beer but definitely doesn’t taste like one. Hardly drinkable, go for something else.

Tomos Watkin Merlins Stout (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Stout;Tomos Watkin;A Mes rate: Gravicask. I’ve said this before but I hate slating something when I am the first to enter it. Sadly there is not much else I can do. Nose is very bland with only some very faint barnyardy notes to detect. Mid brown colour that is fairly light for a stout. Tea in the flavour with hardly any of the roasty dark malt and coffeechoc character you would expect from a stout. Bitter finish wraps it up. Very plain and uninteresting stout.
Tomos Watkin Merlins Stout (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Stout;Tomos Watkin;Deep black in colour, with a light roast malt nose, and a complex rounded roast malt flavour with a pleasent linger.
Tomos Watkin Merlins Stout (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Stout;Tomos Watkin;Draught half pint at NERAX on 5/4/06. Rapidly fleeting light-tan head recedes to nothing, with no ring even. Medium clarity throughout a dark, milk-chocolate brown body, with dark auburn highlights on the edges. Faint, faint, faint nose is weakly chocolatey. Actually, I think I just made myself think I was smelling that because it’s a stout. I honestly couldnt smell much more than light yeast. OldGrowth was able to find some light roast and a hint of coffee, which I suppose I could find upon warming, but this had to be the most lacking aroma I’ve ever smelled. And my nose wasnt shot because we compared it to the Acorn Stout and that was beautifully aromatic and complex. Flavor was, unfortunately, almost equally as bland. Light touches of syrupy-textured water, very loose, with the barest hint of lean chocolate and a hint of dry graham crackers and yeast on the finish. No flaws though (on the meager plus side) and not oxidized, just needs more there. I little more primer would have gone a long way on this one.
Tomos Watkin Merlins Stout (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Stout;Tomos Watkin;Roasted nutty aroma a little sweetness too. Taste similar maybe a little molasses further into it, not very bitter.

Tomos Watkin Merlins Stout (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Stout;Tomos Watkin;Cayo Arms, Cardiff. Dark walnut brown with dirty cream head.

Tomos Watkin Cwrw Hâf (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tomos Watkin;It's all in the experience. Table of six next to us. One old fella said to his companion 'odd choice that, barbecue sauce on fish'. The response 'well it would be but this is chicken' was a delight. Lovely to see folk enjoying themselves. The halloumi and chips were excellent and this was the perfect accompaniment. Golden haze and light on the tongue. All in the shadow of the rolling hills. Lovely.
Tomos Watkin Cwrw Hâf (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tomos Watkin;Pours an almost clear yellow gold colour with a small thin white head. a malty and fruity hop aroma. Quite a sweet light malt taste and a sweet citrus fruitiness. Not much bitterness in a slightly dry finish.

Tomos Watkin Cwrw Hâf (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tomos Watkin;500ml bottle bought at Rhyl Pavillion. Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a thin white head. Aroma is hoppy and metallic. Smells more like a lager than an ale. Taste is hoppy again with very faint citrus notes and the overcarbonation of the beer makes it taste a bit dull. Probably okay on cask as a session beer but a bit bland.
Tomos Watkin Cwrw Hâf (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tomos Watkin;One of my favourite session beers. A great golden ale with a refreshing hoppy aroma. Great from the bottle too.
Tomos Watkin Cwrw Hâf (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tomos Watkin;Brown 500ml bottle best before end of Aug 09, drank late July 09. The cut price store near my house still turns up some weird beers, like this, but normally only once, so if miss um, you miss um for ever! Poured into a vase shaped ’Old Speckled Hen’ branded pint glass. Slight chill haze type look to it, hope I didn’t store it too cold before opening. The colour was a dirty orange or a dull old gold. There is some wheat in the brew, with the malted barley, which might explain the cloudiness. On top sat an off-white creamy head. Sweet Pea and hoppy aroma (Fuggles are used), almost like a summer flowergarden fragrance, but without the hay fever sneezing fear. A fairly rough taste and feel, almost ginger beer harsh at first. A grapefruity/citrusy flavour takes over after the initial shock of the rugged, turbulent first sips. The aroma is at total odds to the taste, both however are fine in their own right. Interesting and very enjoyable, glad I found it in my cheapo store down the road.
Tomos Watkin Cwrw Hâf (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tomos Watkin;Cask (GBBF2011, Thursday) Mid gold. Boring aroma, just a few hops. Nice mouthfeel, but not much flavour. A few minerals in the finish, which spoils its hoppiness a bit. A blandish beer.
Tomos Watkin Cwrw Hâf (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tomos Watkin;Cask at GBBF 2011, Wednesday. Clear golden - offwhite head. Fruity, wooden, toasted, nutty notes, dusty, light bitterness, a bit dull.

Tomos Watkin Dewi Sant (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tomos Watkin;Dewi is dark gold in colour with a sweet and fruity aroma. Flavours are fruity, too - with a sour, refreshing bite. Shame it is a bit dull - it needs some oomph.
Tomos Watkin OG / Owain Glyndwr (Cask);Swansea, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tomos Watkin;Oxford Beer Fest. Gravity. Beer of the festival. Top dog! Sweet. Bramble fruits. Inviting mouthfeel - caressing, soothing, seductive. Little tingles and sparkles of bitterness in among the velvet sky of soft enveloping malty sweetness. This is one hell of a gorgeous beer.

Hidden River Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;"""Aged in cold cellars"", or so says the label. Indeed, the six-pack was purchased at Albertsons. Poured a moderate in size foamy white head; not much for lacing. The colour was a clear copper/amber and a fair bit of carbonation was evident. Aroma was noticably hopped; I liked it. Taste was clean, fresh and hoppingly bitter. A nice beer even though the aftertaste maybe was a wee bit on the thin side."
Hidden River Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;This has got to be some kind of macro brewing mistake remarketed as a pale ale. Tastes like watered-down malt liquor. Smells a bit like dog poo. Shame on Old Fort Brewing.
Hidden River Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;"Smells okay and vaguely pale aley. Looks a bit pale for a APA with a small head. Tastes heavily astringent with very little hop flavor. Very bad when warms. Borderline undrinkable; a tremendous disappointment."
Hidden River Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;LIghtly golden color at least as far as pale ales go, this is very disappointing. Somewhat unbalanced for the style, with overwhelming maltiness and very little if any to speak of in the hops department. Showing through with just a hint of fading pine and nuttiness.
Hidden River Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Bottle: This is a terrible example of a pale ale. Did they forget to put the hops in? The color is typical dark gold with no head. The taste is malty and you can sense, if you try real hard, some hops. The body and feel are fine, it is just that you expect more bitterness from a pale ale. Next time I am staring at a six-pack of this and one of Deschutes Mirror Pond -- I am going swimming in the pond rather than the hidden river.
Hidden River Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Pours a nice golden amber color. Aromas of malts, hops, and a touch of pine. Flavor is pretty good considering this is an macro product brewed for Albertson’s.
Hidden River Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Very light in color. well, it is a pale ale. The tast was light as well. Almost no head to speak of.
Hidden River Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;If you like sweet and skunky, this is the beer for you. Definitely would NOT buy again.
Hidden River Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;I was seriously dissapointed after buyign a sixpack. The color and aroma were quite pleasing. Watery, pours thin dissapearing head. No carbonation, very thin and watery. Lemon, grassy hops - which weren’t bad. Dry aftertaste with a skunky, lagerish overtone in hte finish. This stuff is brewed for a store in Minnesota, and is readily available in Texas and New Mexico - but down here it costs as much as good IPA and APA’s. If someone offered me one, I’d drink it. However, I’m not buying this stuff again.
Hidden River Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;APA swill is what they should have called this one. a sweet straw aroma with a stale snpa taste....very metallic with weak hops taste.
Hidden River Amber;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;Tried this a few years back and wasn’t that impressed but recently found three bottles of it on the clearance shelf of my local liquor store for 50 cents each. That said, my opinion may be based off of old bottles. Poured a cloudy amber color with a very thin head. The cloudy part kind of concerned me but I didn’t see anything odd floating in it. The smell was that of malts and the taste was malts. A little too sweet for me with not much other than malt going for it. Not really my pick for a good brew even at 50 cents a bottle.
Hidden River Amber;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;"Pleasant, but light, malt aroma backed by a hint of grassy/floral hop. Nice amber color with a white head that did not stick. Twirling the glass evinces some temporary lacing. Sweet darkish malt flavor; almost chewy mouthfeel. Carbonation is on the edge of too much. The finish has a little hop, but not enough to balance out the malt. Leaves the mouth a bit tingly though, so there must be something besides malt."
Hidden River Amber;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;Somewhat fragrant floral hop aroma, with a taste that is quite thin and lightly malty. Just a bit of roasted caramel and toasted cereal maltiness. Finishes somewhat sticky and sweet.
Hidden River Amber;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;Thought this was an amber when I bought it. Color is light amber, rather thin looking. Malts dominate the taste, also present are hops and roasted tones. A bit sweet overall. A smooth finish is the best part of this beer.
Hidden River Amber;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;"Pretty bad stuff. Color is kind of light for an ""amber"" beer. Aroma is OK. The first taste is not bad, some malt, some hops, then this wierd aftertaste kicks in, kind of metallic? Also, noticed some diacetyl, which should not be detectable in a lager. Would never buy this stuff again."
Hidden River Amber;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;At first mild taste. The longer you drink the sweeter it gets. Aroma very misleading. Good aroma, flowery aroma at best. Overall very sweet, bottom line
Hidden River Amber;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;Pours a nice medium amber color. Nice roast aromas. Flavor has a roast grain flavor to it. Nice and smooth beer with a great finish.
Hidden River Amber;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;Pours a clear light amber. Has very little head. Has just a little woody taste. Not bad but not good.
Hidden River Amber;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;The label alone almost made me not want to try this beer. The aroma almost tricked me however into thinking it wouldn’t be as bad as I expected. But then it just tasted like yur usually overproduced lager with more sugar. Don’t like this much, it still in my fridge for whoever wants it but i dont think anyone does.
Hidden River Amber;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;"When you go for an amber ale, you’re definitely expecting something that is ""stern"" yet smooth on the palate. Hidden River Amber ale is neither of these. It’s smell is almost deceiving,... but if you smell closely, you’ll smell the sugar. And that’s what it tastes like... beer with sugar in it. It’s almost as though they let the beer ferment, and then put fruit juice in it. I must say that I am disappointed. I would not recommend this beer... not even to take to a ""beer bash"" type party. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I won’t willingly buy this again."
California Rollin Plum Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Custom Brewcrafters;2010 Autumn Festival of Ales. Not a good fruit beer. Like a flat plum. ( Now I have to type in extra garbage so that I’ll have the minimun characters for ratebeer to take my rating).

California Rollin Plum Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Custom Brewcrafters;[draft - 2004 Autumn Festival of Ales - Honeoye Falls, NY] Light aroma of sweet malts and plum mixed with grape. Slightly dry and sweet flavor of malts mixed with grape. Very flat and dry. With some more work, this beer could be really good.
California Rollin Plum Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Custom Brewcrafters;Flat. That being said, it tastes more like a plum drink than much else. Dont really get the beer connection with it. Just a mellow, even, plum taste that needs reworking if this is going to be a good beer.

Kaiser Pils (Germany);Neuhaus an der Pegnitz, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kaiser Bräu;From old tasting notes. Yellow gold color. Big bubble carbonation leads to a large white head. Strong grassy hop nose indicates a huge hop dosage. Dry and assertive. Long dry, bitter finish.

Vermont Pub Saison;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Vermont Pub & Brewery;This saison turned out pretty well. It has a touch of bubblegum or banana on the very front and finishes with a peppery flavor and lingering aroma. It is quite dry and effervescent.
Vermont Pub Saison;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Vermont Pub & Brewery;"Doesn't taste much like the Saison 1900 I had not too long ago; since many of this pub's brews don't seem too stylistically correct, I'll just assume that they're calling this undistinguished medium Belgian ale a ""saison"" to be cool. Very malty, somewhat smoky, fairly heavy-bodied, decent head. Drinkable, but not what I expected and not worth getting again."

Also the alcohol does give it a quite sweet touch.
De 3 Horne Besselaer;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;De 3 Horne;Bottle: Medium sized, vast, thick and slowly changing creamy off white foamy head on top of a murky dark purple colored beer. Looks good! Aromas of berries, cherries, malts, light dusty and some sweets. Flavours of malts, cream, red fruit like berries, some strawberry hints and light bitter and lighter sweet. Aftertaste is a mix of pils malts, berries and floral dust. Low carbo, soft very creamy mouthfeel, medium body and a creamy texture. Not as crispy as I expected, bit dull, there is still some taste and it’s not really unbalanced, hmmm...
De 3 Horne Besselaer;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;De 3 Horne;Bottle at home in London with Lyoli and Sofia. Pours a very hazy pink with a thick, white foam head. Sweet, fruity and brteady aroma. Mild sweet flavor, light tart fruits, some berries. Light to medium bodied with lively carbonation. Finish is kind of bland, modest fruits that are lightly tart, a bit of bready malt. OK but not exciting.
De 3 Horne Besselaer;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;De 3 Horne;Ok color, pretty average fruitbeer smell. Little bit flat taste, don’t really taste berries in it. Carbo is ok.
De 3 Horne Besselaer;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;De 3 Horne;Colour is pretty nice. Smells not too bad also, however it tastes quite a bit different than it smells - in a bad way. Not my beer.
De 3 Horne Besselaer;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;De 3 Horne;27th March 2008 This version has only redcurrants on the label. Sourish if aromatically fruity beer. A bit different and not quite what was expected.
De 3 Horne Besselaer;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;De 3 Horne;With each sip I digged this a little more after initially wishing i’d not opened the bottle. Tart acidic berries and earthy textures interlock to be pretty plesant. The 7% booze is a liitle sharp and spicy. Not too sweet or sappy a fruit beer , which I speculated it might be.
De 3 Horne Besselaer;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;De 3 Horne;Bottle. Cloudy brown/pale orangey reddish beer. The aroma is fruity, and the flavour is bitter notes with berry fruits coming through. Overall a drinkable fruity and mildly bitter beer.

Traverse Pearls Pale;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Traverse Brewing;Draught @ Traverse Brewing Company in Williamsburg, Michigan. Light gold color. Diacetyl filled flavor and aroma, like every single one of their beers, providing butter toffee flavors and aromas, along with an extremely light hop contribution, which seems to hint of celery, herbs and grass. A light hint of Pinot Grigio as well, though light, all blending with the diacetyl and skunk, creating something not good, at all.
Traverse Pearls Pale;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Traverse Brewing;Draft at Traverse Brewing. Small white head with fine-large sized bubbles that mostly diminished. Transparent, uncarbonated and a pale yellow hue. Malty, hoppy and skunky aroma. Malty and hoppy flavor. Smooth mouthfeel. Light bodied beer with good lacing.
Traverse Pearls Pale;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Traverse Brewing;This draft brew from the brewery poured a small head of fine to large sized white colored bubbles that left behind a fair lacing. The body was uncarbonated transparent and yellow in color. The aroma was awful with skunky vomit like notes and the mouth feel was mildly tingly and on the smooth side. The flavor contained notes of hops malts with mild floral notes that was definitely not per the style.
Traverse Pearls Pale;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Traverse Brewing;This is a really light (malt that is) and very light hop character. I found this a little too sweet for my taste. But, if you're near Traverse City or Petoskey, it's worth the seek. Say hi to Jack.
Traverse Pearls Pale;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Traverse Brewing;the owner of traverse brewing co. served me this one at the brewery then followed it up with an extensive tour of the facilities, he said he used galenas and williamettes, the beer was real light and not that hoppy, it reminded me a lot of founder's dry hopped
Traverse Pearls Pale;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Traverse Brewing;I don't usually like pale ales of any sort, but after trying the sampler of Traverse beers I was ready to settle in, have a few of these, and enjoy good beer and the hilarious stories of Valerie, the bartender. A good, solid malt to this well accented with unusual hops. I like it alot! PS - It's also known as Gringo Gold at the at the Red Mesa Grill in Boyne City, one of Northern Michigan's very best establishments.
Traverse Pearls Pale;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Traverse Brewing;This is made for a lively local Cajun food place, but is also available at the brewery taproom. If you do go to the taproom, i hope for your sake that Valerie is working. She is, without a doubt, the most friendly and ebullient bartender ever and just as delightfully, what she doesn't know about beer she is willing to learn on the spot or go charging back into the brewery to find out. Yes, she is married boys, so ease back and listen to the rating now: I thought at first this would be a transition blonde ale kind of thing, and the malt heads in that direction, but it does have a fine and subtle hop arrangement (Galeena and Willamette over the Cascades) that bails it out from mediocrity. The stuff grew on me as I drank and I ended up liking the gentle balance and swing of the brew.
Traverse Red Ale;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Traverse Brewing;Yikes. This is the only truly bad TBC beer (That shandy thing isn't beer IMO), and it's a dandy. Sour, brackish stuff that uses up all that ugly bitter energy right away, leaving a sweetish reddish mush in the second half of the glass. There may be some roasted malts in there (they seem to be what the brewery does best), but that's the most praise I can do.
Traverse Power Island Porter;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Porter;Traverse Brewing;This beer looks and smells quite inviting, but somehow the flavors do not quite seem to pull together for this reviewer. All in all, the smoky smell is what saves it for me. Worth a try.
Traverse Power Island Porter;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Porter;Traverse Brewing;pretty watery but nice and choclately, I have to admit my ratings of all the traverse beers may be a tad high because the guys at the brewery were just so cool
Traverse Power Island Porter;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Porter;Traverse Brewing;Like the stout, this one smells really good - but as for the flavor, look out! It is very metallic, like you're drinking it out of a steel can with traces of oil still in it.
Traverse Power Island Porter;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Porter;Traverse Brewing;The first thing to notice is the raging carbonation of this beast, lending to a strong intimation of cola in the flavor. The cola or root beer action is challenged by some roasty flavors, but they seem overmatched.

The nose is quite undetectable, with only the slightest nuiances of a light hopping present. The body only offers a touch more with light notes of grassy hops, heavy carbonation and delicate caramel. Finishes clean and is quite quaffable. This seems to be made for the masses and is quite approachable in that sense.

Minor diacetyl presence noticeable, more in the flavor than in the nose. A bit sweet up front with brown sugar malt flavors, but dries up reasonably well with some unremarkable herbal hop character. The hops have a bit of a dirty, earthy quality. Eliminating the diacetyl would improve this beer to a low average.

Pours a mostly transparent, cedar bark brown color with a healthy layer of foamy off-white head. Aromas of toasted hazelnut shells and overbaked french bread crust. Light bodied, crisply carbonated mouthfeel. A bit husky, with some mildly astringent grain huskiness and burned bread crusts. A bit thin on the palate, with a nutty, toasty quality making up more of the deep malt character; could really use some more mid-malt depth for body and to smooth out the rough edges a bit. Otherwise it’s relatively clean and straightforward brown ale."
Mackinaw Brewing The Bridge Nut Brown Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Mackinaw Brewing Company;Draft sampler at the brewpub. Poured a clear dark brown color with a medium off-white frothy head that diminished slowly with fair lacing. Medium toasted nutty malty aroma. Medium body. Medium toasted bittersweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of average duration.
Mackinaw Brewing The Bridge Nut Brown Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Mackinaw Brewing Company;I had this last week at the brewpub. This beer was definitely thin, but with a slight toasted malt flavor and nuttiness. Not real good, but drinkable.
Mackinaw Brewing The Bridge Nut Brown Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Mackinaw Brewing Company;A thin clear reddish brown beer with descent head. Toasty aroma with a hop background. Definite nutty flavor, with some hop character, good flavor but very thin mouthfeel. A very drinkable, flavorful brown for a warm spring afternoon.

North Peak Cask IPA;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;IPA;North Peak Brewing Company;This is in fact called their cask IPA and only served on cask, a good idea, and the best beer at this brewpub tonight. Some hoppy aroma, an average mouthfeel. Light orange colour with some lace dots, and a white head. Served close to room temperature, which is correct. Some grapefruit and a decent bitterness.
North Peak Cask IPA;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;IPA;North Peak Brewing Company;First Cask Ale, maybe that could explain the rating. Yet was served warm, flat, flavor was watered down.
North Peak Cask IPA;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;IPA;North Peak Brewing Company;Draft sampler at North Peak. Poured an hazy amber color with a moderate fizzy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Heavy sour citrus hop aroma. Medium smooth body with soft carbonation. Medium bitter flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Good smooth bitter drinkable brew.
North Peak Cask IPA;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;IPA;North Peak Brewing Company;"Tap at brewery. Pours tea brown with an aroma of sweet sugary hops. Flavor is floral hops with water. Palate is watery. Not bad; call it IPA light."
North Peak Cask IPA;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;IPA;North Peak Brewing Company;I found this to be typical IPA from the right coast (East that is) with a hop character lacking and mild malt, this is more typical of a pale ale. Though I found the beer quite refreshing.
North Peak Cask IPA;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;IPA;North Peak Brewing Company;About what you'd expect. Strong rise of citric hops raised almost, but not quite, to the level of insect repellant. Everything subdues and softened in a lovely way by the cask action. Microbrewed pale maltlessness.

Gulczas Piwo Jasne;Wólka Kosowska, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar Jablonowo;Straw color with a moderate off white head. Small ring of lace for each quaff. Sweet malt and floral hops that seem to add to the sweetness. Dry start with only a moderate amount of sweetness in the middle. Thin a a touch watery.

Jabłonowo Imperator (Super Mocne);Wólka Kosowska, Poland;Pale Lager - Strong;Browar Jablonowo;Pours golden with a white head. Aroma is diacetyl and caramel. Flavour is diacetyl and alcohol.
Jabłonowo Imperator (Super Mocne);Wólka Kosowska, Poland;Pale Lager - Strong;Browar Jablonowo;Can, 50cl. Pours a golden/yellow beer with a white head. The aroma is diacetyl, and nothing else. The flavor is diacetyl and alcohol. The palate leaves a burning feeling in the mouth from the alcohol. Overall this beer has more focus on high alcohol than good flavor. A really bad experience.
Jabłonowo Imperator (Super Mocne);Wólka Kosowska, Poland;Pale Lager - Strong;Browar Jablonowo;"Can.50cl. Beer sometimes undergoes a diacetyl rest, in which its temperature is raised slightly for two or three days after fermentation is complete, to allow the yeast to absorb the diacetyl it produced earlier in the fermentation cycle...(They did not do that). The makers of some wines, such as chardonnay, deliberately promote the production of diacetyl because of the feel and flavor it imparts. It is present in many California chardonnays known as ""Butter Bombs,"""
Jabłonowo Imperator (Super Mocne);Wólka Kosowska, Poland;Pale Lager - Strong;Browar Jablonowo;Small white rim over copper-amber beer. More caramel, with bready-chestnut flour aromas, sweet. Alcohol comes out in the aftertaste, rest is pretty decent at first, bready mainly. Certainly better than malt liquor, but nowhere in the class of German Bock. Fiery alcoholwarming, very slick and syrupy. Coarse, but tolerable. Many thanks to Stef C.! Drank under the name of Jablonowo Super Mocne
Bosman Volt;Warszawa, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Polska;What a thin and uninteresting beer... Small thin head on a very pale yellow body. Weak malty aroma. Flavor is malt and hops with a watery aftertaste. Boring and bad.

Konstancin Sokol Mocne;Konstancin - Jeziorna, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Konstancin (Browar Gontyniec);Bottled as Warszawiak Mocny. A dark golden beer with a huge white head. The aroma has notes of malt, alcohol, and brewing cereal. The flavor is very sweet with notes of malt and caramel as well as lighter notes of alcohol, that tickles the palate, leading to a dry alcoholic finish.
Konstancin Sokol Mocne;Konstancin - Jeziorna, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Konstancin (Browar Gontyniec);Warszawiak Mocny. At first - it is not flavorless eurobeer and it is nice. Not so strong, drinkable. More malty, some fruity tones. Not bad.

It was called Sokol and had a picture of a hawk on the label, just like the picture. Slightly malty and slightly salty. I thought it was brewed in Russia by a brewery called Amstar, but the language is so tortured.
Konstancin Sokol Mocne;Konstancin - Jeziorna, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Konstancin (Browar Gontyniec);It is not euro strong lager, its not good enough (hehe). Malt liq. from N-E Poland. Head had large bubbles, skunky aroma, average mouth feel...

Ithaca Anniversary Stout;Ithaca, New York, United States;Stout;Ithaca Beer Co.;Thick black color with a light brown head that quickly goes away. Light produces a deep dark red that pokes through. Strong coffee and licorice scent. Heavy and potend sweet malt scent. The coffee smell takes over. Hint of grape? Dry coffeeish taste, with some sweetness to counter the bitter. Minor fruit flavor, grape and maybe a bit of cherry. Thick mouth, foamy and remains on the tongue for a bit, but not for too long. Not overwhelming. Dry finish. A nice, easy drinkin’ stout. Solid and a bit darker than expected. A very enjoyable stout.

Ithaca Anniversary Stout;Ithaca, New York, United States;Stout;Ithaca Beer Co.;This is is a sparkling deep brown-black beer with a rocky, warm tan head that disappears after a few minutes. When held to the light, I can see about 2 cm into it. The aroma is moderately malty. The primary smell is mild roasted coffee with some herbs and citrus. I can detect the Ithaca yeast: dusty and earthy. The flavor exhibits a good balance between malt and hops. The aftertaste reveals carbonized sugar and semi-dark chocolate. The mouth feel is slightly alkaline. This actually has some body-- not as watery as some of the other offerings from Ithaca.
Ithaca Anniversary Stout;Ithaca, New York, United States;Stout;Ithaca Beer Co.;"12 oz. bottle via Lubiere. App.: reddish hues, dark brown; small, light tan head. Aroma: slightly skunky dark-roast coffee, a bit of molasses, vanilla, chocolate and licorice. Palate: a bit thin with fairly lively carbonation. Flav.: black coffee, slight sweetness and saltiness, a mildly bitter aftertaste, a hint of hops and a bit alcoholic. Not bad."
Ithaca Anniversary Stout;Ithaca, New York, United States;Stout;Ithaca Beer Co.;"12 oz bottle from variety pack. This also doesn’t say ""Anniversary Stout"" but just Finger Lakes Stout. I was prepared to be disappointed by the less than oil appearance... dark, but can still see some light through it. But the flavor is full and quite enjoyable, and like the other Ithaca brews, I underestimated this one. Hangs onto the tongue, but still that’s not always a bad thing. Not the stoutest stout I’ve had, but an enjoyable brew nonetheless."
Ithaca Anniversary Stout;Ithaca, New York, United States;Stout;Ithaca Beer Co.;Growler from the brewery. Pours a deep reddish black with a medium sized tan head. Sweet aroma of caramel and red wine, with perhaps a touch of molasses. Flavor is quite vinous with roasted coffee and a bit of chocolate which build in the finish. Minimal hops presense, and amazingly sessionable for a stout. Wish they bottled this, as I would like to experiment with cellaring this about a year, just to see what happened.
Ithaca Anniversary Stout;Ithaca, New York, United States;Stout;Ithaca Beer Co.;Thanks for the draft JB. DArk red in color with a sweet aroma. Toasted coffe and chocolate flavor. Not the best stout of the night.
Ithaca Anniversary Stout;Ithaca, New York, United States;Stout;Ithaca Beer Co.;Reddish brown color. Classic stout characteristics - coffee and chocolate aroma. Oily finish with some hops, seemed to go towards the dry stout end of the spectrum.
Ithaca Anniversary Stout;Ithaca, New York, United States;Stout;Ithaca Beer Co.;[draft at MacGregor’s - Henrietta, NY] Deep red pour with a creamy tan head. Nice lacing and red highlights. Nice and rich aroma of roasted malts mixed with coffee and the slightest hint of chocolate. Smooth and chocolaty taste at the beginning with a nice and roasty middle and a slightly bitter yet sweet finish. A little thin, but otherwise very good.

Redruth John Daveys Cornish Ale;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Redruth;The former Devenish brewery, established in 1792, recently ceased trading. It is a large facility that had been brewing well below capacity for many years, so the chances of it restarting in its existing form must be negligible. It's a shame that, latterly, at least, they were producing such mediocre beers. The appearance is the best element here (and that's only average - a pleasing red/copper hue. Soggy cardboard in the aroma. Malty flavours and a tinny finish. This beer will be no great loss. 500ml bottle (not bottle conditioned) from beersofeurope.co.uk
Redruth John Daveys Cornish Ale;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Redruth;Hmm, a metallic, petrol aroma starts this beer badly. Looks OK, though - nutty brown. Flavours are thin. metallic and nasty with an unpleasant chemical finish. In fact it was like drinking vomit. So, not too good, then.
Redruth John Daveys Cornish Ale;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Redruth;Just dug out some forgotten notes a very long time after having had this--thanks to SilkTork (having seen his rating) for jogging my memory about having had this. Purchased at Cornish pastie shop in Oxford covered market--I initially attributed some of the poor quality of this bottle to the heat of the shop (bottle was not stored in the refrigerator) though my experience matched that of other ratings found here so the storage is probably not primarily to blame. Deep reddish color, obvious carbonation, doesn't benefit from the soft palate often found in malty bitters. Metallic finish, quickly sapping any enjoyment from the sweet side. Poorly constructed.
Redruth John Daveys Cornish Ale;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Redruth;Dead beer in a bottle. Unpleasant product. Soap foam head with a dirty soap aroma. Slightly sharp mouthfeel from a harsh carbonation. Light to medium bodied. Sweetish malt with a nutty edge - the most pleasant aspect of this product. The hop finish is tinny, metallic, nasty.
Redruth John Daveys Cornish Ale;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Redruth;Bottled. Amber, cheery wood colour with a full, thick white head. Peanut butter aroma, creating a fat, oily expectation in the minds palate. Roasted malt imbedded or fussed in bitterness, resulting in 1 flavour rather then several interesting ones.

Dark and extremely malty sweet: It was a dark brown almost black colour (but the bar is very dark, so I could be out a few shades in my eyes): on top a full, deep tan covering that hung around for the whole glass and produced some heavy lacing.

Morland Independent IPA (Cask);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Originally brewed after it fought a takeover from Greene King, some think Morland's later, friendly merger with Greene King means that this beer will die a symbolic death. That would be a shame. It had a nice fluffy white head (even on a half pint), a good texture, and an enjoyable flavor of cherry and plum, over a relative lack of hops (not unlike Greene King's own un-IPA). (on tap, Seven Stars pub, Marsh Baldon)
Harboe Festival Ice;Skælskør, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harboes Bryggeri;Light golden with an OK head. Both aroma and flavour have notes of wet grain, or perhaps even more like mash. It’s a thin overall impression with sweetness - and it’s incredibly boring. 1755

Harboe Festival Ice;Skælskør, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harboes Bryggeri;"Bottle. Regular golden pilsner colour, but not quite as pale as for example Tuborg – a bit surprising compared to the style (discount summer cooler beer). No head. Not a lot of aroma; sweet, smells a bit of maize, even though it hasn’t been used (instead it has glucosesirup, which I suppose must be expected to smell sweet too). Light taste, watery. No real nuances. But as the label states it is for cooling in the summerheat. Fair to say, it keeps what it promises."
Harboe Festival Ice;Skælskør, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harboes Bryggeri;The aroma is sweet and malty - a very simple aroma. The color is light yellow and it has a beutiful head.

Smell: Roasted malts with a coffee-scented accent to them, low-grade chocolate, and light plums.

Good level of Czech hop aroma characteristics, along with sweet malt . A similar balance of hop and malt carries through to the flavour, but the hoppiness wins out in the finish with a dry bitterness lingering. Reminded me of Lammsbrau organic pils.

Head is almost non-existent, but there is a tiny amount of visible carbonation. Slightly hazy golden yellow color. Flavor is akin to your typical Pils with cereal-like maltiness, but without the bitterness and effervescent palate. Tiny amount of hop flavor in the finish, but the aftertaste leaves this behind in favor of more malt, albeit briefly. Good for quenching one's thirst; I hope that's all it was intended to do."

Barwa jasnego bursztynu, piwo jest przejrzyste. Zapach: lekko maślany i metaliczny to z wad; a poza tym wyraźnie czuć chmielem, nieco słodem - klasyka. W smaku pojawia się goryczka, która jakiś czas pozostaje na podniebieniu, ale poza zwyczajową kontrą słodową mamy jakiś dziwny mdły posmak, który nieco trąci i psuje doznania.

It is +15, women have begun to take off their furs, and I am thinking what interesting beers I can tell you about. While new reviews are being prepared, I will take some cans with German hieroglyphs from my pantry. 😁 So, pilsner from Kaiserdom. 👁 The color is light straw, transparent. The white head is fluffy, reluctantly slides along the walls of the glass. 👃 The smell is inexpressive, sweetish, malty. I would like more, of course. 👅 The taste hasn't also surprised me: malt, notes of honey, some herbs, light hop bitterness. 🏁 The finish is very weak, with sourness. What is it? 🔎 Resume: I can't say that this pilsner is decent. However, for such money, it will be good to quench thirst in the summer heat, but not more. Unworthy beer.

Sweetish taste of caramel, chocolate and some fruity aftertaste. Light body, average carbonation, a bit watery mouthfeel, dry and slightly roasty finish. Not so bad.
Kaiser Premium Dark (Austria);Wieselburg, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Wieselburger Brauerei (Brau Union);Rated from old notes. First impression was of a weak, almost watery beer lacking in aroma or nuance. Faintly skunky aftertaste. An undistinguished offering.

Kaiser Premium Dark (Austria);Wieselburg, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Wieselburger Brauerei (Brau Union);On tap at the World Beer House, Budapest. Typical Dunkel appearance, with a small, creamy white head. Malt extract and slightly coco aroma. Unexpected Stout notes - creamy with a hint of mild cheese, and even some vodka. Those stouty bits are prevalent to begin, then the beer lapses back towards a fizzy base. Quite a strong barley flavour in places - like something you might see in a Scotch Ale or Barley Wine. Anyway I liked this and found it interesting and coolly suppable.

New York Harbor Dark Porter;Staten Island, New York, United States;Porter;Yankee Brewing Company;Very fizzy with a big foamy head. Odd for a porter, and the overcarbonation mars the flavor because all you taste is fizz. A well-hopped porter that's otherwise typical of the style.

Kuhnhenn Classic American Lager;Warren, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kuhnhenn Brewing;From notes. On draft at an “unofficial” company outing to the Clinton Township Taproom on August 08. The pour is a clear darker golden orange with a thick cap of bright white head that lasts, slowly dissipating without a single trace of lace. The aroma is what you’d expect for this. It’s grainy and cereal dominated with a light sweetness and touch of hop. The flavor is definitely grainy with a light bitterness and the rice seems to balance it out. I am not a fan, but it does what it needs to well. The mouth feel is light and watery with a bright-ish carbonation and a lingeringly grainy cereal sweet finish. This is definitely something you might be able to convert a Budweiser drinker with. 6 4 6 3 13
Kuhnhenn Classic American Lager;Warren, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap @ Kuhnhenn: Pale to the levels of Taylor Swift & Kristen Stewart. Straw body, exceptional clarity. Bone white head, shabby lacing left on the glass. Aroma of heavy grains, moderately sweet corn husk, light citrus zest, bready malts, lightly earthy hops, & just a hint of perfume. Flavor personifies the aroma. Fresh barley, lightly toadsted grains, lemony citrus rind, earthy grass, & a slightly dirty hop bitterness that kisses the tongue lightly. Saaz? Balancing bready & doughy malt sweetness in the back-end alongside a very modest corn flavor. Aftertaste lingerings with grain & citrus zest. Spritzy carbonation almost, quite crisp. Maybe just a touch over carbonated. Not a world beater, but a decent pilsner in any case, & much better than Kuhnhenn’s Czech Lager in my opinion.

Kuhnhenn Loonie Kuhnie Pale Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kuhnhenn Brewing;From notes. On draft at an “unofficial” company outing to the Clinton Township Taproom on August 08. The pour is a darker golden orange yellow with a thick bubbly white head and a good lace as it falls apart. The aroma is nice. There is a decent hop presence and a light bitterness, but it’s pretty malty, and that’s not what I like in a pale. The pine resin comes through on the back end, but it’s outmatched. The flavor seems the malts a little more reserves, allowing the bitterness and the hops to shine through. There is a definite earthiness to it, but it’s not too shabby. The mouth feel is crisp and brightly carbonated with a lingeringly malty pine resin bitterness on the finish. One of the better ones of the day. 6 4 7 4 14

Vermeer;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij de Horste;"I love old beer, aka aged beer. Why? Usually because it tastes fanfuckingtastic, but I also would say that it’s the novelty of the matter, too. Even more amazing is the novelty is actual reality, especially when I sit with said aged beer in hand, pondering how age has changed her for the better, or for the worse. But I am rambling. Where was I? Ah yes, aged beer, specifically the Bottle Conditioned Traditional Dutch Ale Vermeer from the Brouwerij de Horste in Belgium. The bottle we shared at a recent tasting was many years old, and I must say, she was at the prime of her long proud life. I’d love to have a go at her again, but the beer is retired so I can’t buy a new bottle to age even though I want to. A crying shame, which makes the glass I savored even more special. Dirty oranges with a miniscule head which scatters rather quickly, lingering as a pathetically thin ringlet. She swirls nicely though, tufting up in proud regalia and tracing lace along her path. Exploding forth from her disturbed depths is a thick, rich nose of orange sherbet, nectarines, mango, kiwi, papaya, guava, and a background essence of green herbs and aloe. Apparently, the tropics have descended unto my glass when I wasn’t paying attention, bringing with them the heavy muggy atmosphere they enjoy so much. It’s alright though; I am a tiki bar beach bum after all. Licking greedy lips, my first quaff is as deep as her equally tropical and exotic depths which waste no time opening up to me. Sweet, pulpy, and fruity, guava and honey coats my lips before smothering all porous surfaces within my mouth. Grab the juicer because here come papaya, mango, cucumber, green pepper, and soft ripe bananas ready to be blended into a tropical smoothie paradise. A soothing presence of aloe permeates her whole palate while a touch of toasted meringue offers up gentle support from the background. Not overly complex, but very rich in palate, she satisfies with each subsequent quaff which I savor with time-honored reverence. Awesome. What was she like back when she was but a fresh babe right off the bottling line? I have no idea, but I can tell you that, years later, time has been generous with her blessings and I am equally blessed to have been able to share in it."

Vermeer;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij de Horste;Pours a light yellow color with a white head. Aroma is spicy, wheaty, and some hops. Flavor is malty, wheaty, spicy, some honey, and a light bitter finish.
Vermeer;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij de Horste;Bright, lightly hazy golden pour with a monster head. Crisp melon and barnyard funk dominate the aroma, rounded out by sweet candy sugar and noble hops. Full bodied and grainy palate. Very sweet with medium acidity, similar to the melon in the aroma. Flavors are more of the same, with a very yeasty and sweet/funk background component. Very pleasurable to drink.
Vermeer;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij de Horste;This Belgian Strong Ale pours a medium gold color from a 750ml bottle. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is malt, fruit, pepper and funk. Medium bodied Strong Ale. Malts are fruity and sweet, lots of pineapple, mango and apple. Hints of pepper and funk mix with some banana and clove as well. Lively carbonation. Nice smooth taste. An interesting beer, it is sort of a cross between a Belgian Strong Ale and Farmhouse ale. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet.
Vermeer;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij de Horste;Cloudy gold, medium head. Aroma is sweet pineapple candy and lightly spiced. Starts off really smooth, almost creamy. Flavors of apple, pineapple and mango are juggled nicely with the sweet and dry malts. Carbonation is light enough to notice and tough enough to somehow take away the sugary sweetness.
Vermeer;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij de Horste;Cloudy orange gold, with huge off white head. Bready and yeasty, with some fruit. Not a big great Belgian, but a more traditoinal farmhouse style. Exactly what I thought it would be.
North Fork Son of Frog;Deming, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;On tap at North Fork, pours a hazy copper with a small white head. Aroma brings out bready malts with a medium English quality and a touch of caramel. Flavour is along the same lines, with English bready malt and a decent amount of caramel. Well-balanced and very drinkable. Good stuff.
North Fork Son of Frog;Deming, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Draft - Biscuit and butter.  Dark gold with a decent beige head.  Butterscotch, light caramel and a long finish.  Classic English pale, not quite as rich and strong as described.
North Fork Son of Frog;Deming, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Draft, April Brews Day. Copper pour with a small white head. Light toasty, caramel malt aroma. Light sticky dried fruit flavors with lots of caramelly notes. Mildly bitter finish. This reminded me most of an ESB with a bit more malt than usual. This had a slight vegetal off note to it. Seems like it could have been a lot better, and I would like to try it again given the opportunity.
North Fork Son of Frog;Deming, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Copper color. Aroma of sweet candy, dried mango, raisin. Taste is sweet, root vegetable malts, minimal hops. Creamy texture. I really like this brewery, they have some very unique and tasty brews.
North Fork Son of Frog;Deming, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Great name! Dark copper-amber colour. Slightly bitter palate has a toasty malt accent. OK beer.
North Fork Son of Frog;Deming, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Dark amber beer, thin lace. Malty aroma. Flavour of crystal malts, raisin, lightly toasted with a touch of diacetyl. Malty flavour as well, a touch of fruitiness. Light bitterness on the finish. Okay, but lacking real character.
North Fork Son of Frog;Deming, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Nothing too truly remarkable as some of their beers can be. Very grainy and chewy with a good hop presence and balance, but just lacked the pizazz of their other beers.
North Fork Son of Frog;Deming, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - American;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;This a nice ale, so well balanced. Flaovur is sweet caramel & chocolate malts as well as roasted malt are working nicely together. Dark red in color with nice lasting head. I nice mouthfull.

North Fork Spotted Owl;Deming, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Draft - Lots of sweet caramel and some Woody notes. Clearish copper. Sweet caramel, some red berry sweetness with a touch of bitterness in the finish. Super well balanced and well done. Huge fan.
North Fork Spotted Owl;Deming, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;On tap at North Fork, pours a hazy orange amber with a tiny white head. Aroma brings out lots of big caramel malts upfront, followed by a little toffee and some dark fruitiness. Flavour is robust and intense, with loads of caramel upfront, followed by dark fruits and just enough hop resins. Noticeable alcohol on this, but it’s really well done. Sweet in the exact right way. Excellent.
North Fork Spotted Owl;Deming, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;750 ml Bottle w/ brew date of 3-11-2011. Mahogany colored in appearance with a circle of tan foam and bubbles. Strong notes of dark fruits, caramel, butterscotch and sherry dominate the aroma. The taste opens up with a moderate dose of brown sugar, date and currant flavors along with some toffee, yeast and black cherry around the edges. Medium-bodied with soft carbonation and more dark fruits and sugars in the finish. Relatively mellow and balanced in spite of the high ABV.
North Fork Spotted Owl;Deming, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;"PIcked this up on my way back from Mt Baker last week; I stopped for directions and walked out with 2 bottles $20 each. Despite the reviews; I was surprises on how good this beer was. It tastes like it was aged in bourbon barrels. I’ll wait for a couple years to break into the next 2012 Spotten Owl."
North Fork Spotted Owl;Deming, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;"Draft at the brewpub. Just like trying to get them to sell you a growler of this stuff (which they won’t), every pour comes with a careful explanation of how expensive this stuff is for them to make. That’s fine, and no doubt 100% true and accurate, but it’s comical how every time a customer asks for a Spotted Owl, this explanation comes trotting out before the tender even reaches for a glass. Still, great environment, very cool brewery, very much doing their own thing--the little personal quirks are part of the charm. On to the beer. You can tell just watching the beer slosh around in the glass that this’ll be a heavy one. Pours a murky medium brown with a dense and creamy tan head that doesn’t stick around for long. Huge sugary nose, very much like some sort of packaged breakfast pastry with lots of white sugar in it. Is there a Caramel Orange and Pine Pop-Tart? Yes? No? Regardless, this is what they smell like. Tingles in your nose holes. Creamy, sticky, fairly thick body. You can feel the grain fighting to break through the water and cling to your tongue and cheeks. It’s safe to say this beer is not over attenuated. If somebody handed me a snifter of this as their latest barleywine, I’d say ""great. So you left lots of residual sugar in there because it’s going on oak for a year and you want it to still have some body on the other side of the tunnel?"" It’s cool that they serve it fresh, and I certainly do have a sweet tooth, but wow--some wood on this not only would calm it down a lot, but seems like what it was built for. Caramel, oranges, sharp grapefruity bitterness, and some resiny pine on the finish. Lots of love went into this, and there are certainly no obvious QA shortcomings whatsoever, but it still feels kinda all over the map."

North Fork Spotted Owl;Deming, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Lots of malt in the nose, hugely sweet notes of raisins, plums, dates, pears, caramel, toffee, earthy notes, and just a hint of butter that actually works very well with this. Really nice aroma actually. Nice amber pour, bright with a fizzy white head. Straight up sweet malty in the English Style - lots of caramel and toffee, tons of fruits - dates, sweet plums, raisins. Lots going on here including a decent bitterness that takes away from the high booze that was expected with this one being 12%. Smooth full bodied beer with soft carbonation. A real treat, I enjoyed this quite a bit actually.
North Fork Spotted Owl;Deming, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;This rating applies to the 2003 vintage which I was fortunate enough to taste yesterday at the Brewery. I had tried Spotted Owl many times over the past six years, and it was always tasty, mellow and warming, if a bit on the sweet side for my palate, and I preferred the more assertive Hair of the Frog. However, something nearly miraculous has occurred after five years of aging this beauty. It has retained the fig/date/raisin profile, but the Chinook hops (which despite their high alpha profile, I’ve never found to be very evident in Spotted Owl) have blossomed into real prominence, and yet, at this point, they are more aromatic than harshly bitter, and give the ale an amazing depth of flavors such as dry sherry, and kumquat, as well as others I couldn’t quite pin down. At this point, I am reminded very strongly of a bottle of eight year old J.W. Lee’s Harvest Ale if it were skillfullyblended with their Calvados-aged version, except the fruitiness is a wonderful addition in the this brew that the Lee’s seems to lack. Many thanks,to Eric, for a truly delightful interlude!
North Fork Spotted Owl;Deming, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;At Hard Liver 2006. ’05 vintage.Clear amber color. Big malty sweet nose . Thick body. Nice medium strong sweet flavors of caramel figs dates. Another good one at the fest.
North Fork Spotted Owl;Deming, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Oh, this was a disgracefully tacky excuse for a barleywine. Tasted old, shroomy and very vegetal, with some herbal spiciness, vinous and ethanolic alcohol. Light fruitiness, and severely imbalanced, a trainwreck of a beer.
North Fork Avalanche Amber;Deming, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;The reason my friend herbstress gave this such a wonderful rating is due the the overt hoppiness this beer posesses, and if you look at her ratings, the hoppier the better, reguardless of what the style may be. This was tasty, the hops were nice, and I'd be lying if I said there was no real malt presence, but it was hard to find the full body of the malt through the IBUs. Unfortunately, the malt I did manage to weed out in the flavor was slightly bland and a bit coppery/metallic. Maybe I should try this after hiking the Skyline Divide (just kidding Angela).
North Fork Avalanche Amber;Deming, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Not the best amber but a great beer nonetheless-- especially after hiking Skyline Divide on your way back on Mt Baker Hwy
North Fork ESB;Deming, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;On tap at North Fork, pours a clear pale golden with a small white head. Aroma is almost non-existent, with biscuity malt maybe. Flavour is kind of stale, with English biscuity malt and a touch of diacetyl. Not very pleasant.
North Fork ESB;Deming, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Draft - Caramel and a touch of butterscotch with a hint of twig.  Clear dark gold with a rich white head.  Light grainy caramel and a touch of twig in the finish.  Not bad.
North Fork ESB;Deming, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;On nitro at the brewpub. Dear North Fork: you are awesome. You are one of the few brewpubs I tell my non-beer-geek friends to go out of the way to visit. When you put beer on nitro, please note this on the menu. That way, people will know what they are ordering. Thank you. Your friend, Tom. Poured a burnished dark copper with a dense, flat, doorstop of a nitro widget head. Spent several minutes on the table doing that falling bubble dance ’cause it had nitro in its pants. Toasty caramel and iced tea nose. I think I am in the Crystal Malt KKK (CMK?) now, because as soon as that stuff shows up, I have nothing but bigotry to offer it. Watery, powdery nitro body. This beer seriously needs to eat a sandwich. Frickin nitro. Toast, caramel, iced tea, and a bit of earth on the mid-palate. Iced tea and earth finish. Probably a pretty tasty and refreshing ESB if poured on CO2.
North Fork ESB;Deming, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Lightly sweet fruity aroma, some floral hops. Pours amber with a creamy white head from the nitro. Lightly toasty, sweet, and fruity flavors with a mild hop bite in the finish.
North Fork ESB;Deming, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;clear red-amber with long-lasting white head. a little flat int he mouth (nitro). A little skunky but in the positive way, honey-sh malt with distant smoke
North Fork ESB;Deming, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;On tap at the brewpub. Pours clear amber with a creamy white head that leaves sheets of lace, due to being a nitro pour. Light body, and a light, vacant taste. A bit of butterscotch on the dry finish.
North Fork ESB;Deming, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Pacific Northwest Vacation 2007 8/19/2007: North Fork ESB is an orangy-amber color. Its dense, off-white head is long-lasting and leaves thick, solid lacing very much like a beer induced with nitrogen might leave. The aroma is creamy and buttery. The flavor has vanilla, a butter toffee maltiness, and a mellow bitterness that is slightly citrusy and herbal. This ESB is nicely balanced overall and has a medium body with creamy and mellow texture. Draught sample at The North Fork Brewery - Pizzeria - Beer Shrine in Deming, Washington. Rating #8 for this beer...
North Fork ESB;Deming, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Draught at the brewpub. Clear nut brown. Grassy nose. Sweet with clean, hard mouthfeel and notes of ash. Spicy bitterness. The malt character is simplistic and way too hard to be pleasant.
North Fork ESB;Deming, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Hazy brick colour. Toasty, caramelly aroma and palate. Sligtht earthiness and phenols. Rather poorly developed flavour profile. Sort of fizzy, which isn’t normal in their beers. Not up to their usually high standards. As it seemingly wasn’t much when mjames visited and it is low season at North Fork, I wonder if this beer hasn’t been sitting around too long. I’ll give this another shot in winter.
North Fork ESB;Deming, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Draft at the brewery Murky brown color, some orange hues as well. Flavor is crisp and light, while the body is still a little thick. Hoppy, sweet lemons, starchy, and a little sour with a grain and husk flavor of corn cobs and hay. Not so good, but drinkable. The nose has some corn, but also some banana and grapes.
North Fork IPA;Deming, Washington, United States;IPA;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Tap at the brewery. Pours a murky medium amber with bright golden highlights. Dense creamy tan head that sticks around forever. Sweet caramel and pine nose. Creamy medium body, running into heavy grainy territory. Caramel and pine dominate the mid palate. Classic sturdy big body pnw ipa with simple and elegant flavor profile.
North Fork IPA;Deming, Washington, United States;IPA;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;On tap at North Fork, pours a clear golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out piney hops, some resin and bready malt. Flavour is along the same lines, with some piney and resinous hops, and biscuity malt to back. The hops aren’t particularly well-suited, but there are at least no off-notes. Decent IPA.
North Fork IPA;Deming, Washington, United States;IPA;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Draft - Light caramel and mellow peel.  Clearish gold with a decent white head.  Sweet caramel, nice peel notes and candy citrus.  A bit sweet but well balanced bitterness makes this a nice beer.
North Fork IPA;Deming, Washington, United States;IPA;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Decent, easy-to-quaff IPA. Snappy hops up front. Malt side offers bread dough, cookies and white cake. Slight yeast. Hint of butter. Floral and citrusy hops. Balanced bitterness.
North Fork IPA;Deming, Washington, United States;IPA;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;On tap. Clear copper gold with thin head. Low to medium carbonation. Hoppy aroma. Fairly simple but clean flavour with assertive bitter citric hops predominating. Likeable fresh IPA.
North Fork IPA;Deming, Washington, United States;IPA;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Brassy amber, ok head. Soft fresh milled grain nose intermingles with malt subtext and lightly fruity hops. Pretty restrained hoppiness for an IPA, perhaps more akin to an Amber or and English Pale Ale. Fresh graininess in the body with a finish of tannic sourness. Mild fruity hops.

North Fork Dry Stout;Deming, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;After a day of hiking at Mt. Baker I stopped by for a good pint of my favorite. The smell of roasted malts was wonderful and the creamy nitro white froth was inviting. It was smooth with a good chocolate flavored dry finish. I have drank a lot of tasty stouts and the North Fork never disappoints.
North Fork Dry Stout;Deming, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;"On nitro at the brewpub. There really isn’t much of anything I would change about this place, even if their lineup doesn’t climb much higher than the solid to very good level. But I would certainly ask them to note on their menu when they have a beer on nitro. Ordering a beer that sounds good and having it show up doing the nitro fadeway from top to bottom just doesn’t set a very pleasant expectation at the table. Well...provided you’ve grown to think there’s really never any call for nitro, as I have. Anyway, on to the beer. Pours nearly black and certainly opaque. Dense creamy dun-colored bubble-free hockey puck of a nitrogenous head. Chalky, ashy, slightly chocolatey nose, with that chocolate certainly of the baking chip variety. Watery, powdery nitro body. Sorry to be a broken record about the nitro thing. Alright, I’m not sorry. Chocolatey, slightly roasty mid-palate shot through with ash. Definitely thinking patent malt is one malt that can fight through the flavor-deadening scrim of a nitro pour, at least in whatever quantity they added it to this beer. They certainly have earned the right to call this a ""Dry"" stout. Ashy, chalky finish. I bet this beer is actually probably a nice dry stout poured on CO2. They probably love it out of the bright tank, and I bet a lot of the rest of us would too. I guess all too many people just love watching that nitro settle...maybe if I drive up here all the time and become a regular, I could get them to take the turbo off a keg sometime. Sounds like a lotta work for the sake of curiosity though."

North Fork Dry Stout;Deming, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;North Fork Brewery/Pizza/Beer Shrine;Pacific Northwest Vacation 2007 8/19/2007: North Fork Dry Stout has lots of darkly roasted malt and barley in the aroma and flavor. The flavor also has a hint of chocolate. The color of this beer is dark brown, but pretty much looks black in the glass. It has a lasting dense, creamy head that leaves adequate lacing. The body of the beer is medium-light and a touch watery, but smooth and mellow all at the same time. It kind of feels like skim milk or something on the palate. Overall this is a decent dry stout that would benefit from some additional body as well as some complexity to take the edge off of the near-burnt aroma and flavor.

Coastal Fog Pale Ale;Concord, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Coastal Fog Brewing;12oz bottle - A bit better than their IPA, but still not saying much.

Kaiserdom Prostel;Bamberg-Gaustadt, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kaiserdom Privatbrauerei;Bottle: Pours a pellucid yellow with light white head. Wow, this beer averages BELOW a 1? I can’t wait! It smells like malt after its spent and has been sitting in the sun for about 10 hours. Lots of husk, crust and rotten fruit notes. The flavor is....unpleasant. A combination of grain, chemical and sourdough. Ugh. Like 2nd runnings from a bad batch of homebrew that you intentionally forgot for a few hours.

I made the mistake of reading ahead and well...I just hope my expectations are not too high. Clea, small white head, nearly colorless. Lets hope the same is true for the flavor.

Unser Bier Amber;Basel, Switzerland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Unser Bier;Drinking this beer, in one bar, at the zoo, in Basel, at the end of the winter. In my point of view, it is a honorable amber beer, a typical product of the German school. The color is orange/brown and clear, average carbonation, thin and white foam. You get a side of bread, a bit metalic, toffee and sugar and you have a typical touch of perle hop, a bit tough but light and refreshing.

Horn Imperial Porteris;Kaunas, Lithuania;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);(Bottled@HBF 2005) Clear, dark brown cola color with a smallish, disappearing head. Slightly roasty, sourish aroma. Somewhat alcoholic, roasted-malty flavor with berries. Alcoholic, sweetish finish. Not very pleasant, not very imperial and not very porter. A semi-decent, alcoholic dunkel at most.
Horn Imperial Porteris;Kaunas, Lithuania;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);Sweet and licorice aroma, brown color with big head. Not so much of a porter in my mouth, good that style here in RB is bock. Very strong alcoholic aftertaste dominates, body is somehow thin. Some roasted flavor comes up in the end too, but nothing beats alcohol flavor. Expected more of this beer.
Horn Imperial Porteris;Kaunas, Lithuania;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);I can’t call this a Baltic Porter in its best dreams. Lovely mahogany colour, though. But this is all about grainy notes, spent coffee grounds, and most importantly a thin, lifeless body that feels like a 5% beer.

Horn Imperial Porteris;Kaunas, Lithuania;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);Nut brown. Licorice aroma. Full bodied, salty, notes of almond, lingering salty finish. Pleasant, but very confusing beer. Like a cross between a baltic porter, a vienna, and a belgian ale.

Sweet malts, but not overly, strong banana and bubblegum on the finish. A nice dunkel more than a German wheat.
Outer Banks Cara-Mellow Weizen;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Very nice tangy citrus and malty - yes some caramel flavors in addition to the typical wheat flavors. The caramel also adds a touch of sweetness. Nice aromas - some herbal
Outer Banks Hop Monster IPA;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Amber/copper in color. Sweet malt aroma, citrus, bread, some molasses, light toasted malts, and bubblegum that gets stronger as it warms. Has a nice bitter bite but is missing the hop flavor. Sweet malts, some citrus, light fruit, and that bubblegum again. It’s not a bad IPA, really, but that bubblegum got to me after a while and was a bit annoying. Decent, though.
Outer Banks Hop Monster IPA;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Outer Banks Brewing Station;"Brewed under ""Hip Hop IPA"". Copper-amber pour with a huge head and nice spiderlace. Very nice grapefruit and pine resin nose. Flavors of pine bitters, grapefruit and just a touch of sweet malt. The body feels a bit thin, not watery, but not enough to support the balance between flavor offerings and the lingering bitter peppery pine finish. Overall, a good IPA, but with a bit larger body, would be a contender for one of the best! Nice brew."
Outer Banks Hop Monster IPA;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Outer Banks Brewing Station;[draft - Outer Banks Brewing Station - Kill Devil Hills, NC] Poured a nice copper color with a decent sized white head. Strong hoppy and peppery aroma with a slight sweet and citrus flavor underneath. Very good hoppy taste at the beginning that mixes into a slightly citrus flavor and a nice hop and pepper finish. Reminds me of Victory Hop Devil. Very good IPA.
Outer Banks Hop Monster IPA;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Coppery red appearance with good head. Hoppy nose. Excellent malty flavor, with strong hop-grass-citrous aftertaste. Darker than I expect an IPA to be, but wonderful beer.
Outer Banks Hop Monster IPA;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Outer Banks Brewing Station;"Not currently called ""Hop Monster"" I don't believe, I just saw it as ""IPA."" A nice light golden color, a bit hazy, really quite appropriate for a traditional IPA. American versions of the style tend to be a bit too dark in appearance. In any case, suprisingly little aroma for what followed flavorwise. Malty, yet crisply balanced hops, fruity rather than bitter on the end. Very nice."
Outer Banks Hop Monster IPA;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Too light of a color for an IPA, very light straw almost golden in color, pretty decent head, well carbonated, loaded with hops, left a little too spicy of an aftertaste which hung around a little longer than needed, but not too bad of an IPA
Outer Banks Hop Monster IPA;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Outer Banks Brewing Station;"Hazy straw color. Strong hops - mostly Perle and Goldings - very little of the centenial (to my palate, anyway). Nowhere near being a hop ""Monster"" this was more of a hop ""Troll"" - more hops than Red Hook IPA, but les than Brooklyn's. Could have used some malt presence to help balance it out. Not bad, but needs some work."
Outer Banks Copperopolis;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Strong Ale - English;Outer Banks Brewing Station;"This is much like an ""IPA light"". An amber-copper color with a great head and huge spiderlace. Caramel, a touch of grapefruit, and a hint of pine resin to the nose. The flavors are exactly the same, in the same order. A well-hopped bitter back-palate finish combines with a syrupy mouthfeel to combine for a good overall brew. Again, less like an ESA and more like an ""IPA light""."
Outer Banks Copperopolis;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Strong Ale - English;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Your typical amber-ale. copper color, small head. medium malt body with some hints of caramel. the hop presence was decent, but the finish left a chalky taste in my mouth. not very memorable.
Weeping Radish Pilsener;Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;Possibly old.

Fancy Pants Pale Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);Draught (at a baseball game): The beer is a cloudy, golden color. Fair amount of head. Decent nose of hops and a little spiciness. Decent balance, with perhaps a tad too much hops for the style. Overall, not a bad beer at all!
Fancy Pants Pale Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);This was the cloudiest APA I've ever seen. It looked more like a wheat than an APA. At first, I thought it was going to be all yeasty, but it tasted ok. Mild floral hop aroma. Slighly tangy. Medium to light body - though carbonation was scarce. This was on tap at the NE Taproom in Reading.
Fancy Pants Pale Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);Had this at the Manayunk fest in Phila. A nothing special pale. Had worse, had better.
Fancy Pants Pale Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);Much too hoppy. Not a very complex brew. Similar to the Victory Prima Pils but much less complex. I did not find this beer too appealing.
Fancy Pants Pale Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);This beer pours into the glass an amber/deep gold color with some slight cloud. The head is a white/cream color. The aroma is of malt, caramel, hops and some spice. Was compared to a dark tea that was drank earlier in a way. The taste showed a molasses malt, hops, and spicy tea. Bitter and hops are at the end, but it is nice. Enjoyable.

Fancy Pants Blueberry Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);Smelled exactly like blueberries. The draft version had a short lasting head and left almost no lacing on the glass. There was a weak berry taste, not nearly what you'd expect from the smell. Rerate: After having this a couple more times, it's still good, the taste gets to be a little too much. Not nearly as bad as the Bar Harbor Blueberry I had though. I couldn't even finish a whole pint of that. This I can have at least two before I start to think about whether or not I want another blueberry or something else.
Fancy Pants Blueberry Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);Smells like blueberry pie-sweet & spicy. Dark amber clear w/off-white sm foamy lacing head. Med-hi fizz in med watery body. Taste is pretty good. Lightly hopped ale w/nice blueberry elements. Light spicy bitter-like pie. Spicy finish and weak berry bitter after. One of the better blueberry ales.
Fancy Pants Blueberry Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);Golden yellow with a slightly cloudy hue. Light head that evaporates quickly. Mild carbonation. Surprising delicious. Bluebery flavor is very present but not overbearing. A very unique beer that gets better as you drink the glass! I enjoyed this beer. Fruit but well balanced. Light, crisp, abundantly vibrant. Fresh and unique. I wanted another after I finished the first.
Fancy Pants Blueberry Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);It just isn''t my style and all though it was drinkable I don''t think I will ever have it again.
Fancy Pants Blueberry Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);The blueberry flavor went well with the hop variety used... very refreshing beer
Fancy Pants Blueberry Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);"I should preface this review by saying I am a big fan of ""fruit beers"". Biggest problem I had with this beer was the lingering aftertaste. The blueberry aroma was a great start, but the finish coated my tongue with blueberry. I think they use whole blueberries and not extract. I believe the acidity of the blueberries was the source of the lingering aftertaste."
Fancy Pants Blueberry Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);A nice beer. Blueberry in the nose but not so much in the flavor. I'm assuming extract was used as that's one of its characteristics. Otherwise pretty decent but I thought it was a little heavy on the bitterness for what it was. Id rather have an I.P.O.!
Fancy Pants Blueberry Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);A lot of blueberry in the nose & aroma, cloudy light copper in color, kept a decent head, not too much berry flavor in the beer that would make it overpowering but just enough to make it a very smooth blueberry brew
Nokian Kellari IV A;Nokia, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Nokian Panimo;Nice dark brown colour. Medium head. Not much aroma, some alcohol maybe. Faint chocolately flavour, slightly roasty. Light bodied.
Nokian Kellari IV A;Nokia, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Nokian Panimo;Mahogany coloured, rich head. Weird ginger aroma. Light bodied, dry, grassy. Only slight bitterness, but lingering aroamtic and salty finish. Not bad, but in bad need of more malt.

Tauras Kobra;Vilnius, Lithuania;Malt Liquor;Vilniaus Tauras (Royal Unibrew);An orange beer with next to no head. The aroma is very sweet with no complexity. The flavor is of an OK maltblend with only slight notes of the alcohol content and a good palate. A fine beer for a barley wine -but not my style.
Tauras Kobra;Vilnius, Lithuania;Malt Liquor;Vilniaus Tauras (Royal Unibrew);Bottled at the Danish Beerfestival 2003: Light golden. Quickly deminishing head. Not much to say. Some hops and load of alcahol in the nose and flavour. Me don't like. Drain pour.
Tauras Kobra;Vilnius, Lithuania;Malt Liquor;Vilniaus Tauras (Royal Unibrew);Color not bad. Aroma also. Strong. But the taste is terrible. Like motor oil.

Ragutis Fortas Dark;Kaunas, Lithuania;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);Mahogany coloured, beige head. Coffee and alcohol aroma. Medium body. Notes of licorice and coffee. Nice, but but the body doesn't carry all the alcohol.
Ottakringer Gold Fassl Pils;Wien, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ottakringer;Bottle at an airport lounge in VIE. Modest foam and very clear yellow body, vegetably hops on the nose but otherwise sweet. Flavour is mellow hops and pilsner malts. Understated but clean.

Vor einigen Jahren erfuhr sie eine Verjüngungkur und zusätzlich wurden einige Sorten hinzugefügt. Das Pils ist aber ein alter Hase und war stets ein edles Bier. Es wurde beim European Beer Star 2016 mit ""Gold"" prämiert und somit zum besten Bier in der Kategorie ""German-Style Pilsner"" gekürt. Ein Fakt, das viele bis heute nicht verstehen. Aber bleiben wir neutral. Das Bier überzeugt durch eine frische Bitterkeit, trotz der es aber süffig bleibt. Ein solides Pils, das man gut und gerne trinken kann."

Soproni Kinizsi;Sopron, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Hungária/Soprony Brewery;Bottled, 0.5 l (ABV 5.1%). Colour is clear gold with a bigger sized broad pored white head on it. Grainy nose. Easy aroma ruled by grain and sourish yeast, mouthfeel is slick, somewhat oily. Short to medium long, yeasty, bready finish. Almost no hops here...
Soproni Kinizsi;Sopron, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Hungária/Soprony Brewery;0.5 l bottle as Soproni Kinizsi, 5,1% ABV. Its huge upside that it has no bigger downside. One od the not-too-bad macro lagers out there. Definitely better than the original soproni.
Soproni Kinizsi;Sopron, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Hungária/Soprony Brewery;Had it back then. Bottle. Remember, it was a dissapointing one, i wouldn’t buy it again.
Soproni Kinizsi;Sopron, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Hungária/Soprony Brewery;Dear raters! Taste it again! It has a new design and a new everything. The beer is better than the avarage beers in Hungary. And you can buy it only if you have some fortune and around Sopron. So it has a golden color and a small white head. Some malt and caramel in the aroma with sourish yeast and a mild hop. Medium body with sweet malt and light-toasted caramel, lively carbonation, bottom-fermentation yeast. Medium bitterness in the finish. Not a big deal, but better than the avarage hungarian slipslops...
Soproni Kinizsi;Sopron, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Hungária/Soprony Brewery;bottled, 500 ml. Typical corn-flavoured Hungarian beer. A bit of roasted malt gives it some bitterness. ozujsko hasn’t seen much of Hungarian beers if he calls this one the worst :))

Redfish Wout Bier;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;On tap at Brouwer’s. Pours cloudy amber with a huge frothy white head. Aroma is pretty weak. A little bit of dusty belgian yeast and a VERY subtle sourness. Same with the taste- it was listed as a sour, but the sourness was barely perceptible. What was there was a little bit of nutty funk, some candi sugar, and maybe a little bit of banana. The mouthfeel was light and creamy- pretty nice actually.
Redfish Wout Bier;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;I am confused. Apparently it seems that if I add Elysian Wout Bier it will simply become an alias of this beer... Whatever. On tap at Elysian Capitol Hill. This is named for Peter Bouckaert’s son, so it must be the same thing. Anyways, yeasty spice on the nose with hints of clove and banana with a subtle lactic tartness in there as well. Pours hazy yellow gold with a thin head. The flavor is initially sweet and fruity, standard Belgian Ale-ish, subtle tart/sour aspects for the two strains of lactobacillus. Light effervescence, pleasant and drinkable, just nothing spectacular.
Redfish Wout Bier;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;Pours a cloudy white with a nice head and light lemonade aroma. Weak hefeweizen-esque taste with fruity notes, slightly sour. Creamy body with light carbonation. Bo-ring. On-tap at Elysian, and billed as an Elysian/New Belgium collaboration.
Redfish Wout Bier;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;Back on draft list at Elysian, which has a new collaboration with New Belgium. Very cloudy yellow hue with no head. granny smith apple aroma and taste.
Redfish Wout Bier;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;This beer is a hazy lightly golden color. My first smell I get notes of cherry, then some weird fruit aroma kicks in. There is definitely some exotic fruit aroma in this one. The taste has the same weird fruit in it, I really can't quite figure it out. The aftertaste is strongly of some funky exotic fruit. This beer is quite refreshing, it seems to be about like a Belgian Wit with some exotic fruit in it. This one is so weird that it becomes that much more interesting, definitely worth a try if you can get your hands on it.
Redfish Wout Bier;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;Very unique. Fruity aroma - orange peel, corriander (maybe), characteristic Belgian plum/pear esters, and light acetic sourness (vinegar-like). Hazy yellow orange in color, head was nonexistent. Flavor echoes the aroma, mild acetic sourness, decent malt flavor, and complex fruitiness. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, a quite enjoyable beer. Kind of a cross between a Flemish sour and a Belgian wit.
Redfish Wout Bier;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;"Draught @ Papago brewery Woutbier - This beer is collaboration between New Belgium's head brewer Peter Bouckaert and Oskar Blues head brewer Brian Lutz. Oskar Blues is the same great brewery that brings you that wonderful microbrew in a can; Dale's Pale Ale The beer is named in honor of Peter's son, Wout. (Although the original name of the recipe was Slijtersbier.) We label it as a Flemish Sour--Brian calls it a Belgian Ale--and others swear it’s a dobbel-wit. Regardless, you won't find much about it on the internet--it’s that rare. So after you have read the above, I’m just as confused after 3 samples and a big imperial mug of this beer, kind of taste like all the above. Color a hazy orange to amber color, the head almost non-existent as is the lace, what there is of it is an off white. Over ripe pineapple, wheat, yeast, sweet malt, crisp and fresh is the nose with the start malt sweet, top is skeletal in feel. Finish is crisply acidic, lemon lime tart, hops quite mild, very, very dry aftertaste, sure as hell a different breed of beer and I’ve tasted some strange concoctions in my life. Actually thin but drinkable and one that makes you think “What the Hell is this stuff I’m drinking”, which a treat these days with all the “clones” that pervade the liquor store shelves, I actually liked it I think?"
Redfish Wout Bier;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;Paleish yellow colour, with medium head. Nice mouthfeel, with lively carbonation.Mild citrus/fruity hop notes.Hard to clasify. Sort of Saison, sort of Lambic? Nice beer.
Redfish Wout Bier;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;Draft: Clear and light-golden with a weakish head.

Hawks Super Natural IPA;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;IPA;Hawks Brewing;Draught @ Bier Stein, EugeneHazy dull straw colour. Light earthy aroma. The flavour is husky grain and very herbal hops with hints of anise and nutmeg. There is a light lemony character as well. This is a fairly unique brew. Balanced and very dry in the finish as the malts disappear.
Hawks Super Natural IPA;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;IPA;Hawks Brewing;This beer was just loaded with malt complexity, and has some much need hoppiness, but somewhere in the middle they bypass each other and I do not feel this is the most balanced IPA I have ever had. Tangy, zesty mouthfeel, but it is just not coming together for me. This definitely has more of an English Pale Ale character for me, finish is somewhat buttery.
Hawks Super Natural IPA;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;IPA;Hawks Brewing;22oz bottle (my bottle read ’Natural’ vs. the ’Organic’ as pictured). Poured a medium golden color with a larger sized, slightly off white, head. Some floaters. Aromas of light spices, some citrus and had an earthiness to it. Tastes of stronger spices, some citrus, flowers and some malts (caramel). I’d put this on the low end of the bitterness scale.
Hawks Super Natural IPA;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;IPA;Hawks Brewing;Hazy golden color,small white head that faded quickly leaving nothing behind.The aroma was Citrusy with a mild malty side and a juicy fruit gum thing going on as well.The flavor was better then i was expecting.Mildly sweet with a nice citrus showing some maltiness and the hops are fairly well done.Over all not a bad brew at all but i think there are betetr versions of the style out there,but it would do in a pinch.
Hawks Super Natural IPA;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;IPA;Hawks Brewing;Pous a cloudy gold with a nice fluffy head. Some bubble gum and herbal flowers in the nose. Some juicy fruit in the flavor mix with a soft melange of hops, mlld bite of pine and flowers. A bit soft and watery. Drinkable, not great.
Hawks Super Natural IPA;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;IPA;Hawks Brewing;Thanks to Wohlfs for this PNW IPA! This pours a huge off-white head over a hazy light amber body. Light malt and hop aroma. The flavor follows what was hinted at in the aroma. Well done, well balanced, but certainly not an extremely hoppy or bitter IPA. Could use a bit more assertiveness for my palate.
Hawks Super Natural IPA;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;IPA;Hawks Brewing;(22 oz bottle: $3.95 at Belmont Station in Portland, OR) Drinking this beer with my buddy Cliff, we both thought the same thing when we first took a whiff of this beer: it smells very much like a stale lager. But if I swirl the beer, a grainy maltiness becomes much more apparent, as well as a modestly spicy hoppiness, but the hops in the nose is not nearly enough for an IPA. The aroma also slightly reminds me of chili peppers. If that’s not bad enough, the flavor is just bizarre. It’s actually quite sweet, and there’s a significantly floral flavor, like what I imagine eating rose petals might be like, and it’s moderately bitter and spicy. As it warms up a bit, mild graininess emerges in the flavor, but it still has this vague resemblance to a lager. Maybe that’s a psychological holdover from the initial aroma though. However, the sweet and floral nature remains dominant throughout the session. Medium bodied, never thinning even in the finish, but despite the bitterness, it doesn’t have a crisp finish. Dark golden in color, perhaps with an amberish tint. Very tall and tight off-white head shows solid retention, holding a full finger’s height for several minutes. It never fades below a thin, complete layer, and leaves a lot of spotty lacing on the glass. It’s not very good for an IPA, and actually, I’m not even that fond of the beer in general, but it sure looks pretty.
Hawks Super Natural IPA;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;IPA;Hawks Brewing;22 oz. bomber, shared by DarkElf - thanks! Hazy amber-orange color with a large off-white head and an abundance of tiny floaties. Mild aroma, intially smelled like a stale lager, as breathed and warmed, more sweet citrus and earthy hop notes became evident along with a distinct dustiness. Strange combination of flavors, lightly sweet, good hoppiness, a little atery, tart orange juice along with dusty and ashy notes. Medium body, smooth mouthfeel.
Hawks Super Natural IPA;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;IPA;Hawks Brewing;(22oz bottle) Cloudy amber body with a medium white head. Aroma is medium sweet, caramel, chocolate, some floral. Taste is medium sweet, floral, caramel, some chocolate, grapefruit (grapefruit in the finish). Light-medium body, a little light on carbonation. Seems more like an amber tan an IPA -- it has a bite but not a strong one.
Hawks Imperial Gold Malt Liquor;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Malt Liquor;Hawks Brewing;Poured dark golden in color with a small white quickly diminishing head. Chunkies everywhere floating around. Reminds me of that drink orbitz, but not quite that bad, and colorful. Aroma of sweet corn. Taste of corn meal, a bit yeasty, and a sweet malt base. Not as bad as I was expecting. Thanks Hopdog for sharing.
Hawks Imperial Gold Malt Liquor;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Malt Liquor;Hawks Brewing;I had this one sitting in the back of the cellar just aching to be opened for a ’special’ occasion. Glad to share it for Eric’s #2,700. Poured a medium golden color with a small sized white head. Lots of suspended floaters. Aromas of yeast, lighter corn, and caramel. Hmmm, not that bad for a Malt Liquor. Tastes of caramel, corn, grains, and vanilla. The corn was there, but not as nasty as I find it in most malt liquors. I drank my whole glass of this one!
Hawks Imperial Gold Malt Liquor;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Malt Liquor;Hawks Brewing;Poured a hazy amber color with a small, off white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of caramel malts, toasted dough, vanilla, and corn. Taste of more toffee, caramel, and corn, bit the alcohol was well hidden, and the usual nasty, metallic, corniness was not present... as it usually it is malt liquors.
Hawks Imperial Gold Malt Liquor;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Malt Liquor;Hawks Brewing;Thanks to hopdog for this one...last rating 7/16/06 we are bringing this one back from the dead! Pours a hazy golden orange with a bunch of small floaties and a medium creamy bubbly lightly lacing head. Aroma of caramel corn, alcohol, vanilla notes, touch of citrus, floral notes...for a malt liquor that is over two years old not horrible. Flavor was on the lighter side, some citrus, grainy notes, hints of corn, kind of dry and probably the best Malt Liquor I have ever had.
Hawks Imperial Gold Malt Liquor;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Malt Liquor;Hawks Brewing;Bottle: Had a malt aroma for the most part along with some bitterness. Cloudy orange body with white head that went flat. Had a citrus lemon bitterness to the flavor. Different than othe malt liquers this one was almost like a pilsner. Smooth and refreshing at leat after a 3hr flight.
Hawks Imperial Gold Malt Liquor;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Malt Liquor;Hawks Brewing;Bottle poured a cloudy orange with no head Aroma is corn, malt,hops and alcohol. Flavor is fruits and citrus with a warming alcohol finish. Not bad..got better as it warmed up, or maybe it was me warming up.
Hawks Imperial Gold Malt Liquor;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Malt Liquor;Hawks Brewing;Blind rating. Pours cloudy deep yellow with a patchy and edgy white head, spotty lacing. Aroma is hoppy, honeyed malt and yeast (dough) with floral notes. Heavily bitter and a burning acidity, alcohol notes, sourness at the end. Warm and fizzy, burpy and slightly dry palate.
Hawks Imperial Gold Malt Liquor;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Malt Liquor;Hawks Brewing;Hazy orange. Chewy texture with some alcohol burn. Malts were grainy and a little nutty. Hops were citric, flowery and bitter. Drying finish. Not a bad malt liquor.
Hawks Imperial Gold Malt Liquor;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Malt Liquor;Hawks Brewing;"Beer pours a clear, medium gold with a small, white, mostly and quickly diminishing head. The aroma is malty with heavy notes of husky toasted grain; heavy miscellaneous notes of honey and light notes of corn. The flavor is sharp and heavily bitter, lightly acidic with an average-length, heavily bitter moderately warm finish. The body is light, the texture is watery and the carbonation is average."
Hawks Imperial Gold Malt Liquor;Roseburg, Oregon, United States;Malt Liquor;Hawks Brewing;I will talke some corn in a bottle. This was really hard to finish a bottle of. I agree with some of the other raters. If you are looking for an alternative fuel source...look no further. I felt like I could breathe fire after drinking this. The flavor is really malty, malodextrin, just a bit of like pear fruitiness, but the alcohol is what killed me on this one.

Thouroutenaere ( ... - 2013);Alken, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken);When Louwaege stopped brewing, Alken-Maes not only adopted their Hapkin, but also this regional ale named after the inhabitants of the Western Flemish city of Torhout. This Alken-Maes version is stronger than the original Louwaege version and is still made for beer shop Verhelle each year. Off-white, milky head over a pure ’old gold’ coloured, clear beer. Sweaty grains in the nose, unripe peach, apple peel, tomato, walnuts, hay, raw potatoes, vanilla, ’jenever’. Rounded, supple palate with subdued peachy fruitiness, some caramelly and very lightly nutty malts, herbal hops and some noticeable, but not disturbing alcohol in the finish. Rather bland.

Thouroutenaere ( ... - 2013);Alken, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken);Bottle, 33 cl. Blond beer with medium white head, many bubbles. Taste is hoppy and light bitter, some fruitiness and orange peel noticeable. The strength however lies in the taste, where malts are combined with fruitiness and orange peel on the background, some nice sweetness of the foreground and a light hoppiness and bitterness in the finish. In the overall pallet however the beer lacks a bit depth. Nice beer overall, but certainly not that exceptional one.

Weel, as a hungarian, I am a bit sad, that one of the greatest hungarian brewery, the Pécsi Sörfőzde namet this crap ""Pannon"", wich refers in Hungarian and Latin to Hungary.

Pannon Gold;Pécs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pécsi Sörfözde;0.5l bottle bought at some SPAR store in Budapest. Poured a yellow body with a small whte head that went away relatively fast. Almost no aroma, maybe some sourish graininess. Extremely watery, sourish, metallic, dry near the end. Some cardboardy grainy maltiness which actually helps this mess a little. Probably used half a hop cone for the entire batch. In the end you end up being glad that this is so light. Not offensive and cold enough might pass for drinkable if you are extremely low on cash, thus not Pécsi’s worst moment, but not far.

Fuller's Honey Dew with Cranberry;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);First tasted this in Gabriels, Paisley in April 1997. Cask, handpump dispense. Pale orange amber in colour with a thin creamy white head. Sweet floral note of honey evident in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives a sweet shortbread biscuit base with refreshing clear honey flavours not cloying in the mouth. Dusty hop resins add a slight bitterness to the short aftertaste. The smooth finish has a warming alcoholic mead note which slips down a treat. One of the better honey style ales out there and a refreshing summer session ale. Well recommended.

Goose Eye Bronte Bitter;Bingley, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Goose Eye Brewery;First tasted this in Gabriels, Paisley in July 1999. Cask, handpump dispense. Dusty floral hops present in the short aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt delivers a weak digestive base with slight citric notes of fresh lemon rind. Decent smack of floral hop resins add to the building up of bitter flavours in the astringent aftertaste. Finish is dry hopped with citric notes of lemon and lime which fade fast. An ok session bitter but there are better out there.

Irma 13er Ren Guldøl;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;Bottle. Golden colour, short head. Grainy sweetish aroma. Flavour is bit sweet with a touch of malt under the grains. Even Irma wants their own pi**y beer.
Irma 13er Ren Guldøl;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;(Bottle 33 cl) Beautiful pilsener golden in the dark end of the spectre. Limited head.

Batemans Harvest Zest;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Batemans;Tasted in 2002. A dark, yellowy golden beer with a weak white head. The nose is of sweet roasted malt and toasted wheat with just a hint of lemon in the finish. The taste is of a wonderfully smooth hoppiness, the toasted wheat and malt are present again, as is the citrusy finish that lingers on the tongue. (Bottle).
Batemans Harvest Zest;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Batemans;Bottled, Pastuerised. Pale orange colour small head. Lemon zest with hops, smooth and drinkable but overall leaves you unimpressed.
Batemans Harvest Zest;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Batemans;Amber in appearance, pours with virually no head. Light, refreshing, zesty nose. Grapefruit give it a wonderful zesty taste that enhances the good flavour of this beer.
Batemans Harvest Zest;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Batemans;Another light and refreshing type of summer beer, this time with the addition of grapefruit zest. I enjoyed it, although its light appearance, and lack of any real depth of flavour makes for a easily forgetable drink. Not bad though.
Batemans Harvest Zest;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Batemans;Bottled. Gold colour, moderate head and condition with some lacing on the glass. Citrusy lemon nose, more citrus in the mouth along with a delicate pepperiness. Finish starts bitterly and becomes harsh and astringent at the end.

Charleston Wheat;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Carolina Beer Company;On draught at Palmetto Pub in the Charleston airport. Clear golden color with a thin white head and tiny trails of bubbles. Thin and spotty lacing. The aroma is lightly wheaty with a pinch of hops. Light-bodied and mildly carbonated with small amounts of wheat and citrus flavor. The finish is pretty bland. Decent, but nothing to write home about.
Charleston Wheat;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Carolina Beer Company;On tap at the brewery. Golden color with diminishing white head. The orange kick in the flavor makes this a very refreshing summer beer. Enjoyable.
Charleston Wheat;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Lemon grass dominates the flavor of this wheat. A little too light of a wheat beer for me.
Charleston Wheat;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Carolina Beer Company;This wheat ale pours a pale yellow color with an entirely diminishing white head. The aroma is not very good, it smells like wet cardboard and gym socks. It has a light body with low carboantion and a weak, watery mouthfeel. The flavor is barely sweet and wheaty, with only a faint hint of spices. The finish is weak and watery, with no additional flavors. Very uninteresting.
Charleston Wheat;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;Carolina Beer Company;Watered down flavorless beer. No sign of wheat anywhere, or anything else for that matter. Not enjoyable at all. Don't kid yourself, this isn't beer -- It is yellow tap water.

Pike Oatmeal Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Pike Brewing Company;One of my favourite oatmeal stouts. Very rich, thick flavour. Hugs the sides of the glass. Smells as good as it tastes. Faint scent/taste of coffee, lingers on the tongue for awhile. Wish it was available in California!
Pike Oatmeal Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Pike Brewing Company;Pours a brownish black with nearly no head. Barleywine-esque aroma, fancy molasses. Lovely toasty taste, again, molasses and a touch of bittering hops. Chewy, creamy body with decent carbonation. Niiiiice. Many thanks to G for the taste!
Pike Oatmeal Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Pike Brewing Company;Tap. Pours a dark brown with a medium tan head. Aroma of hot chocolate and coffee. Earthy, smoked coffee bean flavor. Licorice and chocolate. Astringent finish. Not my favorite style, but a lot for the tongue to discover with every sip. B
Pike Oatmeal Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Pike Brewing Company;Tap at brewery. Pours nice and black with a fading head. Aroma is slight cough syrup with sweet sugar. Flavor is peaty chocolate with a nice roasted finish. Palate is a bit thin, but it’ll do. Nice beer, but needs more thickness.
Pike Oatmeal Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Pike Brewing Company;Near black colour. Chocolatey, slightly roasty aroma. The flavour is oaty, chocolatey and roasty, in good balance. Complex, tasty, simple version of the style.
Pike Oatmeal Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Pike Brewing Company;Draught Black, small yellow-brown head. Dry, typical oatmeal nose with slight acidity and a dusty coffee aroma. Bit watery stout, licorice without the sweetness. Grainy, again oatmeal character. Watery texture, rather than prolonged dryness. A bit disappointing.
Pike Oatmeal Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Pike Brewing Company;This is not a terribly impressive version of this style, as with most of their beers. Just being mediocre, but they seem to have gone way down hill in more recent years. Sugary sweet creaminess, roasted coffee and a hint of oatmeal cookie dough malts.
Pike Oatmeal Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Pike Brewing Company;Draft. Nearly opaque red brown. Small brown head. Lactic sweetness and some roasted malt in the aroma. Salty, meaty smokiness dominates the flavor. Some sweetness and residual beef jerkey smokiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium and fairly smooth.
Pike Oatmeal Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Pike Brewing Company;On tap at the Brew Pub. Dark Brown, very little head. Served wayyyy too cold. This seemed almost frozen. Some good malt taste, but it was covered up by an astringent bitterness. Not a big fan...
Pike Oatmeal Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Pike Brewing Company;(Draft: Pike Pub & Brewery in Seattle, WA) Yeah, it’s an oatmeal stout, but not a terribly impressive one. It shows the usual roasty oatmeal maltiness, a fair amount of bitterness, and a slight sweetness, but the medium body just seems a bit watery for a style that should be nice and hearty. It’s also fairly dry, and I prefer my oatmeal stouts to have a bit more sweetness to it. Dry, roasty oatmeal nose also shows a bit of spiciness. Deep, dark brown in color, ruddy mahogany at the edges. Light tan head is again bubbly at the edges and settles to a wide ring. Many patches of foamy lace decorate the glass. It’s passable for an oatmeal stout, but not one I’d be inclined to order again if I saw it on the menu at another bar.

Stella Artois Light;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);"500 ml can from LCBO, served quite cool in a tulip glass. App.: Clear straw golden with a fair white froth. Aroma: Very light cereal and grain, sulphur tones, maybe a hint of fruitiness and grassy hops? Palate: Medium body and carbonation. Flav.: Some light cereal/grain, some light biscuit, very, very light fruitiness, little else; the finish is more like a vanish. This gives people the wrong idea of Belgians, much like Bud Light or Coors Light in North America. For shame!"
Stella Artois Light;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);This is terrible. It’s a slightly more viscous version of water. There is no taste, very little aroma of skunk and zero taste. Like zero! It felt as if I had paid $5 for a draught of water. So disappointed.

Jever Fun;Jever, Lower Saxony, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Friesisches Brauhaus zu Jever (Radeberger Gruppe);Bottle from an Edeka, with an American style roast beef sandwich. Light amber, short head. Spicy grain nose. Flavor is hoppy enough with earthy notes. But the weird grainy flavor behind it tastes like chewing on a mouthful of barley. Back to the sandwich.
Jever Fun;Jever, Lower Saxony, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Friesisches Brauhaus zu Jever (Radeberger Gruppe);330ml bottle from Beer Hawk. Pale golden colour with a small white head which does not last. Metallic, mineral aroma. The taste is dry with a metallic note. Not very good.

Carlssons Bruksöl 2.8%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Canned. A hazy light golden beer with a lazing white head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of citrus - and so is the flavor, while the body no wonder is thin. Not bad for a 2.8% ABV beer.
Carlssons Bruksöl 2.8%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;"(Can 50 cl) Courtesy of Ungstrup. Hazy, pale golden with a rough, white head. Lightly tart, citrusy and pineappleish nose. Fairly watery body with a vague tartness. No real bitterness - just a vague acidity as sometimes found in what’s called Swedish ""färsköl"". 180907"
Carlssons Bruksöl 2.8%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;50 cL can. Pours hazy yellow with white head. Aroma is fresh fruity, flavour is the same with a nice acidity to it. Ends refreshing fruity.
Carlssons Bruksöl 2.8%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Can Cloudy very light blond color. Sour apple vinegar aroma, sharp (well, if it was a Lambic or Berliner Weisse I would understand…). The mouthfeel is very light, almost watery, without hops and with a sharp citrusy sourness that is actually refreshing. I rate it as I would trust the quality of a Berliner Weisse, otherwise I should just give it a plain 0.5.
Carlssons Bruksöl 2.8%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Can. Very pale yellow colour. A discreet beer and a bit hard to find any particular aroma or flavour.
Carlssons Bruksöl 2.8%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Well it's rather nice looking. BUT a sour odeur from corn and an extremely watery palate.
Carlssons Bruksöl 2.8%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;"Not much expected from this beer. The usual boring story: very thin and watery and not much hops (I don't wanna be too cruel). I have doubts to calling it ""all malt""."
Carlssons Bruksöl 2.8%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;3.5 %. Nice beer. Had it from a can on a ski slope. It was quite powerful in spite of the alcohol content.
Carlssons Bruksöl 2.8%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Pale yellow with short-lived head. Vague fruity/grassy aroma, I actually since a a trace of hops. Very light bodied (read thin), watery finish. Reasonably dry, though, which saves it from being dismissed as crap.

ThunderBolt;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);It’s like...what do you say? India is another one of these countries where every beer basically tastes the same. This one has this odd alcohol singe to it though. I’d rather have a Kingfisher and that says a lot.
ThunderBolt;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);Lacking in taste.but it definitely hits you.appearence is ok aroma is also nice.......
ThunderBolt;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);The taste is not good. Sometimes the taste varies from state to state. Not a good one to drink.

ThunderBolt;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);Well Thunderbolt is not a regular beer with loads of fizz (like soda) and strong bitter aftertaste. It requires different mannerism to enjoy a Thunderbolt. The beer is rather pleasant to your taste buds and sinks in gradually. It is enjoyed best when chilled at a low temperature. The first sip would signify that it is not run of the mill beer. One needs some patience to actually allow the beer to show some amazing charm. Even with the kind of low levels of alcohol, it will give you subtle kick after couple of bottles and it is from here that you fall in love with this beer. So if you really want to enjoy this beer then have some patience and enjoy the delicate aftereffects.
ThunderBolt;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);Bottled 0,33L. Absent head and artificial orange color, insufficient fizzy aspect. Inconsistent aroma with notes of watery cereals and little other. Gaut, dampent and sweetish unpleasant taste and body.
ThunderBolt;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);Bottled, acquired and drunk in Jipru, India. Next to Kingfisher who has its own airline, this is the most marketed beer in India. Perhaps not as readily available as the marketing would suggest, I walk in several stores advertising it only to find blank faces when I enquired. Short on structure, body and flavour, but long on alcohol, shear brute force alcohol. Another India classic. [Glycerol included]
ThunderBolt;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);"0.33l bottle, Thunderbolt Lager Beer, 5%. Fot the italian market, but bought in a indian shop in Graz, run by some Sikh (or just some Indian that likes to wear the headgear), and his apprentice. I saw two very interesting things. A) The apprentice scrubbed the bottle vigorously with a dry rag after taking it out of the ""cooler"", and b) I bought it on the 19th of December of 2006, and it expired in 18.09.2006. Also, it was bottled on the 18.09.2005 (!). Haha... I got an even older bottle than ozujsko, who got his from the same shop a month befome. Ah, well... the things I do for Ratebeer... It poured a yellow colour with a medium sized fluffy head that went away very fast. The nose is reminiscent of a cheap sake, rice and alcohol. and lo! It does claim to contain rice. Surprise surprise. I hesitated... And then I took a reluctant sip. The taste is... well... not that offensive. Rice, apples, medicine, some sugary sweetness, alcohol, somewhat dry/salty. Even some weak weak hints of hop. Heh, I should probably change the style to, say, Ginjo. Not as abysmal as I thought it would be but stilly pretty damn crappy. And odd."
ThunderBolt;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);Bottled(330ml). -from some asian shop in Graz. Had this one before few days and best before end expired on October 18th 2006. Clear yellow coloured, airy head, malty nose. Watery, faint hoppy, salty and skunky with strong maize notes. I’ll try a fresher sample again.
Beaver tAle;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boyne River Brewing Company;Bottle (Beaver Island Brewing Co). I was in the NW Lower Penninsula and couldn’t find a decent craft beer in a party store to save my life, until I found Toski-Sands in Petoskey. Anyway, I picked this one up for the regional flare and was pleased for the mostpart. It was very smooth, sweet and citrusy. It felt more like an iced tea than an ale. My wife dug it, so only had the one.
Beaver tAle;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boyne River Brewing Company;"2004 bottle. Talk about unexpected. It smelled a bit light and dusty as noted before, lightly sour yeast, a bit of wateriness, no sweet notes at all. Pour is yellow-orange, dull and coppery, bottle conditioned with a big white head. Looks as good as most APA’s. Flavor is just weird. It tastes like a light gueuze. I can’t deny that that is what it made me think of. Alot like Lindeman’s Gueuze as far as the lightly sweet, uncomplex nature, but there was a dry, sour almost astringent character reminescent of Cantillon products. Anyways, I REALLY liked it. Very unique, and that’s a great thing when it comes to this style, so many APA’s are the boring same old hops and pale malt. 7/4/8/4/17 While it may have been ""unique"" to someone who just started drinking craft beer, I really cant justify an APA that tastes like lindemans gueuze And cantillon products at a 4.0. If the brewers see this and email me, ""yes we intended to make a wild pale ale"" back in 2004, I will immediately change my rating to a 5."
Beaver tAle;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boyne River Brewing Company;My bottle says Beaver Island Brewing Co. brewed by Traverse Brewing (which makes sense since Boyne River is closed) and I bought the bottle in Dearborn, MI. It was a clear orange until I dumped the yeast into it, which I didn't really mean to do. Weak, big bubble head that disappeared quickly. Dusty grain nose. A little sour for an APA with strong malts and flavors of lemon, apple and dust. Very little hop in the finish. I never have to drink it again.
Beaver tAle;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boyne River Brewing Company;Beaver Island is reachable only by ferry or plane from Charlevoix, Michigan. Isolated in northern lake Michigan, it is a lively place with a fascinating history and easily worth a good beer. This is a fairly standard APA, a decent dose of hops but not too much that you don't get a sense of malt backbone. It's on tap at the Shamrock, the only bar in Beaver Island's only town, St. James. A rare brew but one with not quite as much character as the island or the islanders.
Bell Lager;Port Bell, Kampala, Uganda;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Uganda Breweries (EABL - Diageo);Bottle. Pours clear pale yellow with large white head, a bit doughy malt aroma, high carbonation, sweetish malt taste, thin body, abrupt finish. Generic.

Redruth Cornish Rebellion;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redruth;Bottle. Barley malt aroma. Amber color with small head. Mild malty flavor - clean tasting without a great deal of bitterness.
Redruth Cornish Rebellion;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redruth;As the brewery has now closed, I thought I had better get as many of the beers as I could lay my hands on (which was three) even though their reputation is poor. This was the last of them and not much better than the previous two (Steam Lager and John Davey’s). Nice copper/tawny colour. Bready malt aroma, but with tell-tale cardboardy notes in the background. Malt and bitterness in the flavour, but marred by a distinct metallic edge that was also present in the other Redruth beers I tried. To be fair, that died away further down the glass, but, although it is marginally the best of the Redruth beers, it’s still not great. 500ml bottle (not bottle conditioned) from beersofeurope.co.uk.
Redruth Cornish Rebellion;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redruth;Corpse. From anyone else this would be a poor beer, but coming from Redruth I am impressed. This tastes like most run of the mill bottled bitters. Attractive autumn colour. Some malty aroma with a touch of brown sugar sprinkled over an open flame. Carbonation dies down fairly quickly, but still leaves a tingle. There's a bitterness, and there's some malt. It's acceptable, but not great.
Redruth Cornish Rebellion;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redruth;Bottled.Auburn with a fine white head. Well carbonated. Good hoppy aroma, with lovely malt accents. Good bitter structure and well balanced.
Redruth Cornish Rebellion;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redruth;Bottled, Pasteurised. Dark orange to brown colour, thin head. Fruity malts initially with a pleasant caramel, but again a boiled sweet / tea flavour dominates. Some bitterness in the ending notes and a little lemony hop.

Redruth Cornish Rebellion;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redruth;Bottled. Dark brown, aggressive carbonation. A Reasonably full bodied bitter, with a slightly unpleasant aftertaste.
Redruth Cornish Rebellion;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redruth;Deep amber ruby clear with a large foaming medium lasting pale beige head. Very faint oakey woody hops aroma becoming maltier when warmed. Medium smooth body. Light bitter hoppy start followed by a bigger sweeter slightly burnt malt and woody middle. Sweetness runs more to caramel in the finish. Overall it just lacked enough bitter for my tastes. I guess it was OK, but am unlikley to rush out and purchase again in the foreseeable future.
Redruth Cornish Rebellion;Redruth, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Redruth;Hoppy aroma especially for a bottled English ale, ferocious head on thickish russet body. Very malty taste but with slightly metallic twinge. Despite that I really liked it.
Schlafly English Mild;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Mild Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;On cask - and apparently this had been sitting a while before they put it on. Poured clear copper with vitually no head. ARoma has citrusy hops (orange-like) and light malt - not much here. Body is very light with no carbonation. Taste had light stale malt and the finish had light stale malt and hops. It was quite watery and had indistinct flavors. This is the worst thing I’ve had from the brewery. I will try this again fresh and rerate - it is confusing why they would have something this far past its prime available on tap.
Schlafly English Mild;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Mild Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap, after the Bottleworks tour. This was my first tasting post-tour, and I think it may have turned out to be the most memorable. It’s cool that Schlafly is doing an obsure little style like the mild (obscure for the US anyway), and based on my limited experience, I think this is a worthy attempt. Pale honey pour with a small cap of off-white head. Delicate perfumey aroma. Hard to tell if that is hops or yeast character, but it’s subtle and appealing. Flavor is subdued, but there is a pleasant maltiness and a snappy hop character. And while light on the palate, it’s not unsubstantial. While I love the American craftbrewing’s plunge into bigger and stronger versions of everything, it’s also great to see solid examples of session beer too. Good work Schlafly.
Schlafly English Mild;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Mild Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap at the Bottleworks. Clear with a dirty golden hue. Bread and apples in the nose. Gummy and light. Light malts, light hops, light on flavor. But still a nice breadiness to the profile.
Schlafly English Mild;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Mild Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Sampled on cask at the Tap Room, STL (Fourth of July weekend). Pours dark brown with a generous, frothy tan head. Aroma and flavor are accented by coffee, bitter chocolate and caramel. Some spicy hops and fruits are also in the mix, but are subtle. Full-bodied, lightly carbonated with a dry, clean finish. Very close to Schlafly’s Brown in malt profile. A must-try beer.

Schlafly English Mild;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Mild Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;When poured, this beer had a small sized white head with fine-large bubbles that was mostly diminishing.The body was clear and uncarbonated with a copper hue.The nose was lightly malty and some caramel along with a lightly sweet flavor.This beer lacked flavor in my opinion.The mouthfeel was smooth and watery and light bodied.
Schlafly English Mild;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Mild Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;This rating was from the Hop In The City event where brews from the previous year were sampled (5 oz) by the attendees from kegs. This brew poured a small head of large mostly diminishing white colored bubbles that left behind a transparent uncarbonated yellow orange colored body. The aroma was a typical mild malt hop one and the mouthfeel was smooth. The flavor was a medium mild hoppy one.
Schlafly English Mild;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Mild Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;At Hop in the City: Golden hue with some head. Aroma is malty and aromatic mellow hops. Hint of bubblegum and banana, earthy. Minor twangy and heavy malt taste with a bitter finish. Light to medium-bodied with a dry and woody mouthfeel. Overall good but not great, quaffable.
Schlafly English Mild;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Mild Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;"Gotta agree with Trap on this one. Tasted an awful lot like a toned down Pale instead of its own beer. If i have one problem with Schlafly its that they seem to ""create"" some styles based simply on toned down versions of their bigger beers."

Pelgrim Blond;Rotterdam-Delftshaven, Netherlands;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brouwerij De Pelgrim;Straight golden pour that wears its tall white head at length. Freshly extracted grainy, but even more bready maltiness is accompanied by honest leafy and mostly floral hops. Never complicated, but confident in its bitterness and clean all throughout. A charming entry beer that had the sad task of being my favourite of the lineup.

Riedenburger Pilsner;Riedenburg/Altmühltal, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Riedenburger Brauhaus;"Aroma - grassy and spiced hops. Appearance - the body is gold and unfiltered and effervescent. The head is 2"" and white, and slowly settles. Good lacing. Taste - has a more of malty quality than hoppy. The malt is grainy in nature, sort of cereal like. Hops are kind of grassy. Palate - light body, lean texture, average carbonation, and spiced hop finish."

Riedenburger Pilsner;Riedenburg/Altmühltal, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Riedenburger Brauhaus;I bought this bottle in a Bio supermarket in Paris. I drank it at home, preparing the meal of Christmas in Lausanne. In my opinion, it is an average pils with a pleasant yellow and troubled body. The carbonation is regular and the foam is thin. The taste is malty, small notes of apricot but the taste is dry and decent dosis of hop, a bit watery but it is overall well balanced and fresh is perfect with a bretzel.
Riedenburger Pilsner;Riedenburg/Altmühltal, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Riedenburger Brauhaus;During my week in Riedenburg from 03. - 07.10.2016 - Not as rough and bitter as many other Pilsner.

Aroma of roasted malts, earthy hops and nuts. Taste is malts, caramel, nuts with a moderate hoppy aftertaste without being bitter. Medium carbonation. Smooth and easy drinking. It's a decent Alt alright but just slightly above the average.
Lighthouse Black Smoke Stout;Manistee, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lighthouse Brewing Company (USA);The Lighthouse brewery is located in the fine and distinctly unfudgified northern Michigan town of Manistee. It's in a beautiful old brick building on the river and makes this big black, totally opaque roasted as all get out stout.
Lighthouse Victorian Porter;Manistee, Michigan, United States;Porter;Lighthouse Brewing Company (USA);As bitter as the Northern Lager is sweet, a very quirky porter with burnt and hop laden edges.
Lighthouse Sand Pail Ale;Manistee, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lighthouse Brewing Company (USA);I'm becoming corrupted. Not only am I starting to order pale ales, I'm starting to like American hoppy versions like this one. I've been around you all too long.
Lighthouse Sand Pail Ale;Manistee, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lighthouse Brewing Company (USA);Interesting cloudy weisslike appearance and a fine creamy mouthfeel. Otherwise it's your average APA - decent hops but a lame cracker crust malt action.
Lighthouse Cherry Porter;Manistee, Michigan, United States;Porter;Lighthouse Brewing Company (USA);Light and even tasteful use of cherries here in a beautiful dark porter with deep garnet highlights. The house porter is edgy and bitter and the cherries in this mainly serve to blunt the sharp porter edges. It does get syrupy as it warms, though. Not too many folks can make a cherry brew that doesn't, in my experience.
Lighthouse Northern Lager;Manistee, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lighthouse Brewing Company (USA);"This is really called ""North Country Lager"" - Sean got in too big a hurry to add the Lighthouse beers. In any event, it tastes to me a lot like his dad's maple syrup, which is boiled in a big iron kettle out in the woods and picks up some of the flavor from the iron and hardwood smoke."
Lighthouse Northern Lager;Manistee, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lighthouse Brewing Company (USA);Very sweet. And that is its main downfall. It has a pleasant enough nutty, smoky, almost brown ale flavour, but it's just too sweet and it syrups sadly as it goes.
Samuel Smiths Sovereign Bitter;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samuel Smith;The aroma is soft grain, has good smooth foam on a body that's too yellow for a bitter. Flavour is medium grain with soft hops. Excellent bitter smoothness. It's not bad, rather simple, needs more maltiness for that bitterness effect. Cask at The White Horse pub in SoHo, London.

Some grassy, privet leaf notes. Taste is sweet and leafy bitter in equal measure. Light body. Nitro pour like carbonation. Leafy bitterness to finish. Standard stuff.
Samuel Smiths Sovereign Bitter;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samuel Smith;Amber body. Aroma is malty and fruity, taste is the same with some caramel notes.

Nitro creamy, white head leaving spotty lacing behind. Clear amber coloured body. Subdued doughy aroma. Modest taste profile of grainy fruits. Distant bittersweet endnotes. Foamy in the mouth. Rather below par for a classic bitter. (Leeds 05.07.2017).
Samuel Smiths Sovereign Bitter;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samuel Smith;Keg at Nellies, White Horse Inn Beverley, Brexit ale Tour April 2017. - Mild and soft bitter in all its aspects, offering pleasant diluted lemon jelly, some orchard fruit pear drops on a thinly spread cereal&biscuit base. A halfpint down in a sweet nothing, it needs the surrounding culture and cachet of a great pub to come alive...
Samuel Smiths Sovereign Bitter;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samuel Smith;Aroma is pretty awful. Nice and smooth on the palate. Decent bitter taste. Would drink again but in no rush too.
Batemans Marie Celeste;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Batemans;Cask Handpump at the Crescent, Salford 06/07/2001 Light and bland beer. Unpleasant bitter finish.
Batemans Marie Celeste;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Batemans;Cask Conditioned at The Plough, Bodicote. Pale amber and hazy with no head (direct from cask). There is a certain cereal note, but not the spicy tangy flavour you would expect from this style. The beer is quite bitter with a sharp tinny flavour, this rounds off into a malty finish.
Batemans Marie Celeste;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Batemans;"Very wheaty aroma, though I'm starting to get an idea of what Hallertau hops do and I don't care for it. Amber color, little ring of head. Woody flavor. I don't know what to make of this beer. Perhaps it is a marketing ploy--it gets ""wheat"" on the pumpclip so you might associate it with a continental wheat but it doesn't get the advantages of those styles, leaving a semi-bitter cask ale of less interest. (on tap, Turf Tavern, Oxford)"
Batemans Marie Celeste;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Batemans;Much in the style of a typical English cask bitter, quite different from US and German examples. Has that English bitter hop in the finish with a touch of citrus throughout the palate. Satisfying malt and smooth roundness, very flavorful.
Batemans Marie Celeste;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Batemans;i didn't enjoy it that much, but quite refreshing wheat flavour, a bit soggy i thought at times, but OK, had it super warm in a pub in Winsdor, probably could have been more enjoyable at a slightly lower temp ( not to cool of coures), still i could drink it.
Goffs White Knight;Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goffs Brewery;Cask at 53 Degrees North, Buxton. Malty aroma, kind of ordinary but nice and clean. Clear golden color with small sized white head. Taste follows aroma, nothing new and spectacular but just perfectly balanced drinkable. Kind of floral, moderate bitterness, just light hint of caramel malt. Thin to medium body, soft carbonation, creamy. Great refreshing brew, higher drinkability then water!
Goffs White Knight;Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goffs Brewery;Cask at the Bootlegger, 03/08/19. Clear golden with a decent white cap.

Goffs White Knight;Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goffs Brewery;JDW Chequers Stourbridge Light golden, head is reasonable, retention acceptable. Has a very lager like taste, this isn’t strong on malt or hops but manages a superb balance. It’s not wishy washy because there’s enough beer flavour. Would taste even better kegged carbonated and cooled but right now, today, this is very good
Goffs White Knight;Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goffs Brewery;Cask at the counting house. Pours clear golden, nose is vegetive, floral, lemon, taste is sweet, grassy, hay.

Goffs White Knight;Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goffs Brewery;Not bad. Spice hint and apple. Mild bite on palate. Fair strength but not exceptional.
Three Needs Dunkelweizen;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Root beer appearance, with little head; fizzy. Nose decent: wheaty, lemony, with some good caramel malt and a bit of smoke; flavor rather malty but with some nice breadiness. Letdown is in the mouthfeel; artificial carbonation and very thin body lead to a finish that is less impressive as you get throught the pint. Better than the brewer's Hefe, but just ok."

Vermont Pub Ethan Alien Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Deep golden colour, slightly hazy. Aroma is great. Loaded with bright zesty/floral noble hops. Flavour is a bit watery though. Lightly crackery and a nice herbal hoppiness. Soft bitterness and a long lingering spicy finish. Comes across more pils than helles.
Vermont Pub Ethan Alien Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Clearish golden, direct pour covered by a superb small white cover with a very lacy, sticky white foam. Slightly vegetal, very grainy, sweetish lager with a toasty, cerealic palate. Very soft carbonation. Surprisingly filling palate that grows a good dryness, but never offers much hop aromas. Clean and satisfying offering, if maltier than anticipated.
Vermont Pub Ethan Alien Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Vermont Pub & Brewery;sampled at the brewpub. Aroma is grassy, earthy hops, and grains. Taste is light sweet malts, earthy dry hops, with a crisp finish. Not great, but very drinkable.

Vermont Pub Ethan Alien Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Clear blonde with a small off-white head. Smells nothing. Unmemorable taste of hay/straw with minimal hop finish. Its main goal is probably to satisfy the macro drinkers. It is much superior to the macro Pale Lagers but that’s not saying a lot. So there is an Alien Beer in Burlington, and like in cheap sci-fi movies it is virtually indiscernible from a normal beer.
Vermont Pub Ethan Alien Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Vermont Pub & Brewery;"July 23, 2005. 3 oz. sample at Vermont Pub & Brewery, Burlington, VT.

Sunny Beaches Indian Lager;Rojrachak, Raisen, Madhya Pradesh, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Som Distilleries & Breweries;This beer made me want to vomit, especially since that was the nose. I sipped it because I could not rate it without at least a tast. It was the same.
Sunny Beaches Indian Lager;Rojrachak, Raisen, Madhya Pradesh, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Som Distilleries & Breweries;I would have to say I respect this beer. It has a strong bready feel throughout. Very profound but cancelling hops & malts. I’ll never understand what was in the bottom of that bottle -- were they cow chips from the religious rites of the Ganges? [Did I DRINK any?!]
Sunny Beaches Indian Lager;Rojrachak, Raisen, Madhya Pradesh, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Som Distilleries & Breweries;Yellow Coloring. I Was Expecting The Worst From This Beer, But It Acutally Isn’t All That Bad. The Flavor Has Good Malt and Hops Balance to It...sweet and a Pinch Fruity....Very Decent For the Style.
Sunny Beaches Indian Lager;Rojrachak, Raisen, Madhya Pradesh, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Som Distilleries & Breweries;"Pale yellow, no head...rather lackluster appearance. Aroma is corny sweet and bland...nothing more to say... Taste is more of the same, it’s wet and passes easily past the lips, an okay beverage if your mouth is on fire, but not much of a beer at all. Somehow, I expected better, not sure why, but this is an avoidable dude. I could’ve gotten an old bottle? ""Perfect companion for curry"", promises the label, but I beg to differ. A tasty, not-too-bitter IPA would do the trick better. something with sufficient flavor to match the heat of spice. Just being moist doesn’t cut it. (Although, it’s got enough malt and body to make it a better choice than a Swiller Lite or a Crudweiser...)"
Sunny Beaches Indian Lager;Rojrachak, Raisen, Madhya Pradesh, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Som Distilleries & Breweries;Very yellow/golden color. Kind of a sweet aroma with a little citrus. Taste wasn’t nearly as bad as I feared. A little malt and hops, possibly some sweet grass as well. It didn’t reak of skunk or other trash that is present in most swill. I wouldn’t drink this by choice, but given a choice out of all the Pale Lagers I’ve had, this is probably towards the top.
Sunny Beaches Indian Lager;Rojrachak, Raisen, Madhya Pradesh, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Som Distilleries & Breweries;Bottle. Poured a small fizzy white head with fine sized bubbles that mostly diminished. Fast rising carbonation, transparent and a yellow hue. Malty and somewhat of a skunky nose. Malty flavor. Tingly mouthfeel. Light bodied beer with no lacing observed.
Sunny Beaches Indian Lager;Rojrachak, Raisen, Madhya Pradesh, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Som Distilleries & Breweries;This bottled brew poured a small sized head of mostly diminishing finely sized white colored bubbles that left behind a fair lacing. The body was transparent softly carbonated and yellow orange in color. The aroma was lagerish mixed with dirty socks. The mouth feel was mildly tingly with a mellow finish. The flavor contained notes of malt and mild dough with a little grass and sweet malt.
Sunny Beaches Indian Lager;Rojrachak, Raisen, Madhya Pradesh, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Som Distilleries & Breweries;Yes, I bought this beacuse of the funny, obviously western-inticing name and it was only $1.59 at Blue Max in Burnsville, Mn. Pleasantly surprised though. Light golden appearance, light white head that sticks around for a while. Yeasty, wort-like aroma that was not expected. Flavor has some candy sweetness to it with a bit of banana swimming around in the shadows. Also detect some nectarines in there, odd. Mouthfeel is decent, creamy to say the least. Probably the most complex Indian beer I have had to date.
Sunny Beaches Indian Lager;Rojrachak, Raisen, Madhya Pradesh, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Som Distilleries & Breweries;Clear yellow with nice head when poured in medium tulip glass. Nice sour apricot aroma. Malty and sweet, this stuff is REAL smooth. Label says Perfect With Curry, and I can see why. I would drink this again.

Jasper Murdocks Whistling Pig Red Ale;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;Light, drinkable, but unremarkable. Pretty smooth malty taste that is nicely balanced. Aroma is fairly weak & has a standard red pour. Ok for a hot summer day but otherwise forgettable.
Jasper Murdocks Whistling Pig Red Ale;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;Pours cloudy amber with white head. Aroma is caramel malt and floral hops. Flavor is caramel malt with fruit and mineral notes. Finishes citrus and floral. A bit over carbonated.

Jasper Murdocks Whistling Pig Red Ale;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;Split a 22oz bottle with some friends from work, one that picked it up while in Vermont. Poured a pretty amber-red color with a small wispy off-white head. Aroma was solid caramel malts. Hops don’t linger in this one - it’s mostly malt. A lot more enjoyable than I expected.
Jasper Murdocks Whistling Pig Red Ale;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;22oz bottle picked up at the brewpub in Norwich, VT. Pours a murky, deep amber colored body with a thin, beige head that dissipates quickly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is caramel with a light sweetness, some toast, and a somewhat dry earthy hop backing with some fruit notes. Flavor is similar. Lightly sweetened caramels with a touch of bread alongside a dry, toasty, earthy, light bitterness. Finishes with some fruit notes before leaving a medium length aftertaste. Medium-light, smooth body and a light-medium carbonation. Overall, this isn’t bad at all, but its fairly boring. Dry and easy drinking with a light caramel, toast, and earth. Eh...
Jasper Murdocks Whistling Pig Red Ale;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;On draft at the brew pub. Amber in color with a light red hue. Light white head. Not much on the nose. Light hops maybe a little caramel. Malty red ale taste.
Jasper Murdocks Whistling Pig Red Ale;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;On tap at the Norwich Inn Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights and thinnish off white head that says goodbye after the first sip. Smells of toffee and caramel with some earthy bitterness that barely cuts through the sweetness. Slightly fruity esters add a touch of complexity to the aroma. Taste is sweet and malty with toffee and caramel mixed with a hint of mineral water and earthy hops. Surprisingly dry finish for the medium bodied ale. Moderate carbonation level with a sweet sticky mouthfeel. Of the 4 I had at the Norwich this was probably my least favorite. It’s an ok English style ale but not really to my liking.
Jasper Murdocks Whistling Pig Red Ale;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;Bottle thanks to Jcwattsrugger. Pours reddish amber. Nose/taste of sweet malt, gummy bears, hops and resin. Very short dry finish. Medium body.

Jasper Murdocks Old Slipperyskin India Pale Ale;Norwich, Vermont, United States;IPA;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;This is a castly underrated beer, another victim to the craze of many raters for big over sized behemoths.

Taste: moderate hop character for an English IPA- floral hops a touch of citrus with a solid malt backbone. This was a pretty solid example of the style, although I am always partial to American IPA’s.
Jasper Murdocks Old Slipperyskin India Pale Ale;Norwich, Vermont, United States;IPA;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;Sampled on tap at the brewpub. Pours a cloudy amber color with a medium white head. Balanced aroma of hops and malt. The flavor also has a nice balance between the hops and malt but the hops, there’s also a mild spicy feeling and mild bitterness in the end. The body is medium with a creamy texture and gentle carbonation. This feels true to the English IPAs.

Jasper Murdocks Old Slipperyskin India Pale Ale;Norwich, Vermont, United States;IPA;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;My Bottom Line: Honeyed cereals and wooden hops coexist in this conservative and well-rounded English-style India Pale Ale. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam protects the hazy honeyed gold. -The nose is rather timid for the style. -Some tropical fruitiness is built by the union of the cereal sweetness and the chosen hops. -Effervescence felt a little too intense for my liking. -The dryish hop bitterness is quite decent.

Jasper Murdocks Stackpole Porter;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Porter;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;"My Bottom Line: Roasted molasses and blueberry fruitiness are balanced out by leafy hops in this dryish Porter.

Jasper Murdocks Stackpole Porter;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Porter;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;(22 oz bottle: Obtained 14-Dec-05 in trade with jjpm74, thanks John!) Bottled in October, 2005. Pours opaque and very dark brown in color with a bit of ruddiness at the extreme edges. Sizeable light tan head shows better than average retention, taking a good 5 to 7 minutes to settle to a filmy layer, eventually diminishing to a wide ring with some wisps scattered across the top. This is a very roasty, fairly bitter porter with only a slight sweetness to it and a mild yeastiness in the finish. Light hoppiness seems to be responsible for some of the bitterness, but I think the vast majority is just a product of the dark roasting. Stronger hints of chocolate emerge in the finish as the beer warms toward toward room temperature. Aromas of strong, dry roast and a bit of grain are less interesting than what the overall flavor presents. Medium bodied, probably right about where it should be for a standard porter. There’s a good deal of flavor in this porter, but with all the roast, it’s fairly one-dimensional. Still, a solid entry that competently delivers what is expected of a porter, but doesn’t do anything more than that.

Jasper Murdocks Second Wind Oatmeal Stout;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;My Bottom Line: Dark fruit run through the molasses’ sweetness as dark chocolate rises to segue into roasted malt dryness. This is yet another good quencher from Jasper Murdock’s.

Jasper Murdocks Fuggle & Barleycorn;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - English;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;On tap at the Norwich Inn, Pours a dark golden almost copper color with a fluffy off white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a fair bit of lace. Smells of earthy and floral hops with bready and toffee malts. Taste is malty sweet with hints of earthy hops to cut through the sugar. Butter and toffee are dominant in the flavor only slightly countered by the earth hops. Medium body and level of carbonation, slick sweet mouthfeel. Decent English Pale Ale, nothing extraordinary but certainly drinkable.
Jasper Murdocks Fuggle & Barleycorn;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - English;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;In short: An aggressive and harsh not-highly-drinkable English Pale Ale. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Clear orange-copper body topped by a little white ring of foam In long: Nose of woody hops and tree bark. Basic crisp slightly toasted malts, a little sugary sweet but without much caramel/honey flavour. Carbonation is aggressive and so it the taste. The bitterness is really harsh, not a flavourful or juicy bitterness. Just plain rough. The inherent spiciness (seemed to come from the hops) is too much. A strong mouth drying salty astringency. Some dry orange peels and a light orange peels presence. I like tasty beer but this was just harsh hopping, almost abrasive, and with no body to support it. A poorly put together brew. This is the only beer I had there that wasn’t boring, but to me a night of TV test pattern is less annoying than a Sex In The City marathon.

Aroma is of molasses, coffee, dark chocolate, following by the flavor that is all of the above plus rye bread, carmelized sugar and hops. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied; there is a clean finish to it. When I first drank it years ago, I thought the 7 percent brew was much heartier than I now considered it, which I attribute to years of drinking more assertive beers. Still one of my favorites."

Lake Placid 46er Pale Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;"Thanx George for the bottle. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy copper to orange color. There was a one finger white foamy head that had a decent lacing all around the glass in a messy sort of way. The smell started off with a biscuity/English maltiness (somewhat construed as ""soapiness"" to some but normal to the EPA drinker). Light caramel came in with a decent grainy/toastiness. The taste was bready and had a decent caramel running about it, slightly toasty and grainy, biscuity as well. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium with a decent sessionable quality to it. The carbonation was there, but nothing overbearing.

Lake Placid Barkeater Amber Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;Transfer from BA review on 8-4-12- Poured from bottle into pint glass Appearance – Pours a deep ruby almost brownish color with a two finger tan colored head. The head fades over a few minutes to give a light level of lacing. Smell – The smell is heaviest of roasted malt. Mixed with this aroma are lighter notes of toffee and some coffee. Taste – A sweeter roasted malt flavor meets the tongue. The sweetness is of toffee while the malt is of roasted barley. In the middle these flavors are met with mild dark fruit flavors. Toward the end some light pine hop notes enter the flavor and bitter it slightly with it helping to balance out some of the sweetness nicely. Mouthfeel- The body of the beer was creamier then I would have expected with a carbonation level that is quite average. The creamier body really suits the roasted flavors quite well while the carbonation creates just the right amount of tingle for the sweet flavors. Overall – Nothing too spectacular, but not a bad session amber.

Lake Placid Barkeater Amber Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;12 ounce bottle from Beer Of The (Every Other) Month Club. Rather dark ruby/amber hue, small tan head, nice sweet malty aroma with some earthy note, sweet malty taste with a little too much carbonation and a finish that has a nasty macro-type bite.

Freedom Pils;Alken, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken);Excellent beer to go with meals or social drinks. Its taste is rather neutral so you can drink a lot before feeling you have enough. Also very refreshing after a long summer working day. I always keep a pack of 24 in my garage. Just in case. A very good product.
Freedom Pils;Alken, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken);Commissioned standard lager with snow white, creamy, stable head and pale golden colour, cristal clear. Aroma of pale malts and pasteurization (cooked smell), faint flowery hops. Cooked grainy taste, vaguely sweetish but otherwise fairly neutral, with a brief and restrained hop bitterness in the tail. Watery mouthfeel. Bland as usual for the genre.
Campbells Scotch Ale;Leuven, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);"One of those old school Scotch ales in Belgium which are still effectively labelled as such, but I’m not sure this is still made since CTS is ’back in town’... This was a dark brown beer with ruby hue, off-white head and a rather thin body, grainy and a bit metallic and otherwise overwhelmed by candi sugar sweetness from beginning to end; corn is clearly applied here. Finish was a bit dry but not enough to prevent the sugary sweetness from cloying. Like so many other old school Belgian beers that are nearly forgotten, this was simple and thin, a bit boring perhaps, but in all more interesting than many other AB InBev products. Had an old fashioned feel to it, arousing the amateur of Belgian beer history in me."

Campbells Scotch Ale;Leuven, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Shared a 25 cl bottle from the local supermarket. It pours a brownish dark red colour with a thick and tan head. Aroma is fruity and hoppy. Flavour is sweet, bitter and sour at different times and at the same time. Nice!

Campbells Scotch Ale;Leuven, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);At De Lantaarn, Leuven. Poured a daaark red, almost blackish, with an off white head. Sweet malty nose, plums, creamy, sweet plum taste. Simple, kinda nice, but again, nothing too wild, nothing too special. Ok.
Campbells Scotch Ale;Leuven, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Bottle brought from Belgium by a colleague at work... Tasty beer - very mild on the scotch, which makes it easier to drink...
Campbells Scotch Ale;Leuven, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);This is a review of a brown 25cl bottle, best before 02 Oct 2008, drank on a cold and very wet Jan evening 2008, in Shropshire England. Poured into one of my Gordon’s thistle shaped glasses, well it is a Scotch Ale. It looks grand, a clear and deep ruby red body with a full light brown foaming head. The head soon however fell away. The aroma was of raisins and slightly burnt malty biscuits, very interesting. The flavours were interesting too, again raisins, but this time soaked in alcohol with plums (not a plumb weight), the malty biscuit smell is transfered into a sweeter burnt caramel taste. The beer is a little to carbonated for me and the alcohol tang fills the mouth in the aftertaste a little to much, otherwise it is fine. If the head had stayed and the beer wasn’t so ’fizzy’ I would have scored this really high. The alcohol doesn’t have enough body to work with, it isn’t watery but it just doesn’t sit right, good but not great.
Campbells Scotch Ale;Leuven, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Dark mahogany brown. Malt aroma, slightly metallic. Very rich, creamy malty flavour. Caramel sweetness. Alcohol balances the sweetness well.
Campbells Scotch Ale;Leuven, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);From Backlog head: Small, foamy , off white Colour: Dark brown Smell: malty, irony, skunky, grainy, sweet/bitter Taste: not that bad but just not my cup of tea ... better scotch ales out there. ..
Campbells Scotch Ale;Leuven, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);"250ml. Pours chestnut with a low, fine, unbudging beige head. Attractive, mushy aroma; fig and muscovado-sprinkled dried fruits; a sweet, saline note like cooked mussel meat; bittering herbs (fenugreek), battered sausage (pronounced). It’s probably all sugar-derived. Flavour is slick and fruity with peppery alcohol, ground Indian seeds, dessicated coconut, figgy notes- rich, drinkable and sneakingly complex. Can feel the alcohol on the tongue but not in the flavour. A minor beauty. And something of a surprise. If it’s one of the most disgusting beers you’ve ever had, drink more beers. A world of disappointment awaits."
Flensburger Frei;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Flensburger Brauerei;Bottle from Rewe - golden color, white head. taste is very bitter for a n/a, typical flens-like. not sweet at all, which is very unusual for a n/a pils. bit watery and some cardboard, but overall a very good n/a.

Flensburger Frei;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Flensburger Brauerei;Bland, a bit watery - not as bad as some n/a pilseners, but no equal for the best. The brand has a good reputation in Germany, but this effort doesn't really live up to it.
Flensburger Frei;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Flensburger Brauerei;Bottle from Beerhunter111. Clear golden colour, Medium carboantion, malty, rather dry and bitter. Some chemical hoppy bitterness in the finish.

Clear, golden yellow with a medium large, frothy, almost stable, white head. A bit sweetish, moderately grassy and minimally fruity aroma of fresh grass, grains and traces of citrus. Slightly bitter, moderately grassy, a bit fruity but also rather watery taste of grass, grains and hints of citrus, followed by a short, moderately bitter, rather dry and moderately grassy finish. Thin body, slightly effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Not bad!
Flensburger Frei;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Flensburger Brauerei;Deze alcoholarme pilsener heeft een hoppig aroma. De bitterheid van de hop komt goed terug in de smaak. Verder is er sprake van een neutrale smaak. Niet zo weeïg als de meeste alcoholvrije/-arme bieren. Heel goed te doen.
Flensburger Frei;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Flensburger Brauerei;Im Vergleich zu meinen Vortestern muss ich hier mal eine Lanze brechen: Hierbei handelt es sich um ein alkoholfreies Bier, daher muss die Herangehensweise auch eine andere sein. Schaumkrone recht grob, Farbe hellgelb. In der Nase malzig- getreidig. Geschmacklich malzaromatisch, getreidig, der Abgang lang und herb. Das Mundgefühl ist spritzig und etwas cremig. Für ein Alkoholfreies macht es echt eine gute Figur.

Buckhead Ahtanum Pale Ale;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);Edgy orange zest aroma. Deep orange-rust color with thin lacy head. Mellow, woody/nutty, with citruys hop zip. Medium-high hopping which hang on a bit. Piney in the finish. Warming.
Richbrau Red Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);"Sparkling garnet color. Head dissipated rather quickly. Soft and easy on the palate. Somewhat rich, but a little watery too. Only a slight bitterness in the finish. Nothing too interesting in the aroma department. Has a nice ""fuzzy"" softness in the finish which I liked; must be some of the yeast's contribution. Overall, not bad, but not too exciting either."
Maple Leaf Bulldog IPA;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;Frothy head with a hazy amber body. Herb-like vegetable aroma is present. Light bodied with a short moderately bitter middle, tempered by English-style malts. Not bad, but their bitter is better (and more bitter, I felt).
Maple Leaf Bulldog IPA;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;Draft. Very hoppy beer with a great bitterness and strong hop flavors. This is a good beer. After driving around New England and having too many awful IPA's (have other brewers even heard of hops??), this is one that actually has some hops to it
Maple Leaf Bulldog IPA;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;"July 02: On tap at the VT brewers' fest. Nice hoppy IPA, deep orange in color, lots of orange/grapefruit in the nose, good body with some malt balancing the bitterness. March 03: I must've been overly generous last Summer, or else I had this late in the day when my tastebuds were snapped. Oh, its not terrible, hell its above average from this swill-producing lair of drunk stoned smelly hippies whose vocabulary is built solidly around the words ""dude"" and ""bud""; but this is just a faintly floral, semi-hoppy, vaguely ""Englishy"" syrupy peppery out-of-balance and out-of-whack IPA. I marvel at how mediocre some brewpubs can be and still stay in business, but I guess when your typical customer gets out of his brand new Forester in his $300 North Face jacket, walks in so fried it takes him five minutes to work out the syllables ""g-i-v-e m-e a p-i-n-t o-f y-o-u-r l-i-g-h-t-e-s-t, b-r-o-t-h-e-r"" and forgets to get his platinum card back at the end of the night so you can bump the tip sky-high, well it don't take no genius to make money."
Maple Leaf Nut Brown Ale;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;The English get a bad rap lots of times. Lost so many wars, lost their Empire, had to be bailed out by the USA, bad food, bad teeth, etc etc. Well, this beer is currently called an ENGLISH Brown Ale, and personally I think I should write Tony Blair and have him sue these guys for libel or slander or whatever it would be. No Englishness here folks, and no nuttiness either, just a vaguely malty mess with a weird off citrusy quality that is the only (faint) interesting flavor component I got. It does look like maple syrup though. Whoop-te-do.
Maple Leaf Sadawga Springs Pale Ale;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;"Very pale amber, light head. Decent sweet apricot nose. Thin, watery, bland concoction. THIS is supposed to be a nice quaff after a day of skiing? On the basis of all the ski-town beer I've had, I gotta say the Ratebeerians who ski must be a very small minority in terms of their beer-drinking. The people in this ""brewpub"" were talking about this beer like it was the greatest thing since fiberglass, and with McNeills just a half hour away and mostly empty. What is it with people?"
Richbrau Hop Hog IPA;Richmond, Virginia, United States;IPA;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Oh, man, how I loved this beer! My hat goes off to Mike Banks for this creation. Nicely malted and generously hopped, I thought this beer had perfect balance. Hops were mouthwateringly aromatic, citric, floral, and very clean-tasting. Malt flavors were nice and rich with the perfect amount of sweetness to take the rough edge off the hop bite. This beer was wonderful! Quite possibly the best Richmond-brewed beer I've had.
Maple Leaf Harvest Wheat Beer;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;Sample. HB 51st NYC. Nice! Very nice. I am not into wheats but this one was very tastey. Light in color with a nice head. Light wheat and barley come out at the end. I like this beer!
Maple Leaf Harvest Wheat Beer;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;This wheat ale is cloudy golden in color with a slight white head, leaving behind minimal lacing. Slight banana in nose. Very smooth and articulated, but a bit bland.
Maple Leaf Harvest Wheat Beer;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;Acceptable but not extraordinary. Flavorful but lacking something...........
Maple Leaf Mad Cow Porter;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;Porter;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub: Blackish brown with a small tannish head. Chocolate aroma, smooth in the mouth, but a little too flat. Starts and ends sweet.
Maple Leaf Mad Cow Porter;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;Porter;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;Dark brown with ruby highlights and a small off-white head. Sweet malt aroma of chocolate and roasted malt. Flavors of chocolate and roasted malt with a tangy sweetness.
Maple Leaf Mad Cow Porter;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;Porter;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;Thin body, heavy on the roast in aroma and flavor, but not so much that it is a stout.
Maple Leaf Mad Cow Porter;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;Porter;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;"July 02: On tap at the Vermont Brewers' Fest. Lightish, dry robust porter. Ok body, not much aroma, rather undistinguished roastiness, little sweetness, boring. March 03 at the pub: seemed thinner, blander, very dry, somewhat (inappropriately I think) acidic at the finish. Some chocolate if you look for it. Often porters are the best beers at so-so brewpubs, I find; this is about as good as all of their other beers, which is to say not at all good but not terrible enough for me to go back to the place and burn it down either. At the rate I'm going though I'll find a brewpub that bad very soon."
Trout River Boneyard Barley Wine;Springfield, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trout River Brewing Company;Bottle. 99 cent discount rack. Let’s do this. Cloudy reddish-brown with a small head that fades to a ring. Aroma is pretty faint. Just caramel and stale hops. Tastes moderately sweet. Lots of caramel, some dark fruit, some stale hops, and light cocoa. Surprisingly not terrible.
Trout River Boneyard Barley Wine;Springfield, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trout River Brewing Company;bottle. Brown with small head. Strong and malty, but lacking any real hoppiness. Slightly sweet with caramel. Really could use some big hops. Doesn’t seem very boozy at all. Well hidden.
Trout River Boneyard Barley Wine;Springfield, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trout River Brewing Company;Pours a one finger khaki head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Clear deep amber/ruby color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Fruity caramel nose and flavor is sweet not so dark fruit and caramel. Not cloying. Higher ABV is hidden. $2.49 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT.
Trout River Boneyard Barley Wine;Springfield, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trout River Brewing Company;On tap at trout river. Medium dark brown. Srm of 15. No head. Smell I can't smell anything. Taste - big sweet taste. Brown sugar, cloves and spices actually pretty good. Overly sweet though. 50/50 carbonation. Smooth finish. Minor booziness. It's an alright beer.
Trout River Boneyard Barley Wine;Springfield, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trout River Brewing Company;A dark amber barley wine with a thin white head. In aroma, some grape fruit pulp and raisin, with butterscotch. In mouth, an astringent chalky sour malt, bilous hops, not good. On tap at Positive Pie Tap and Grill, April 6 2012.
Trout River Boneyard Barley Wine;Springfield, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trout River Brewing Company;The pour is a medium amber with red hues and a moderate, long -lasting head. Pretty good clarity for an unfiltered beer. On the nose upfront I get a subtle, mellow malt character with yeast and an unexpected kind of toffee or caramel accompaniment. Not boozy at all but also little in the way of hops. The body is medium to bold. The taste is entirely pleasant and not pungent like so many early Barleywines. This one has probably been sitting around for awhile before being sold so it has mellowed with age. An off-dry hopped ending. The ABV hits me in the end. I am glad I bought a six pack of it so I can enjoy it longer.
Trout River Boneyard Barley Wine;Springfield, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trout River Brewing Company;Pours mahogany into a snifter. Pancake head with good retention bubbles and recedes leaving scant sheets. Butter and candy corn aromas. Sweet flat candy corn upfront turning watery in the lasting butter finish. Huh?
Trout River Boneyard Barley Wine;Springfield, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trout River Brewing Company;Sample at Siptemberfest. Pours a slightly cloudy red/brown with a thin off white cap. Somewhat faint aroma of caramel, toffee and vanilla. Lacks the heavy sweet scent of molasses and brown sugar that one finds in better barley wines. Flavor, too, was on the light side although all the basic flavors were present. Dark fruit, caramel, toffee. Lighter than usual palate with a bitter finish.
Trout River Boneyard Barley Wine;Springfield, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trout River Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Medium amber pour with a light tan head. Very thin for a barleywine. Very sweet with almost no hops detected. Fruity with a hint of vanilla. Not really doing it for me.
Trout River Boneyard Barley Wine;Springfield, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trout River Brewing Company;12oz Bottle thanks to JohnGalt1 we had this right after the IMP Stout they also make. Pours out orange/amber topped with a white head. Aroma was pit fruit, caramel sweetness, light hops, and some rich malts. Taste was much as the aroma with the sweetness leading the way and a light bitterness on the end. Sad to say but the coolest thing about this also was the lable.
Trout River Trout Stream Cream Ale;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Cream Ale;Trout River Brewing Company;Tried at Burlington Brewfest. Light, wheatish, smooth drinking beer. Not too much of a finish in any direction. Pleasant but predictable.
Trout River Trout Stream Cream Ale;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Cream Ale;Trout River Brewing Company;"On tap at the Vermont Brewers' Fest. After the promise of Boneyard, the first beer I've really liked from these guys, I was all set to give them a 2nd chance. Sadly, not to be. Inoffensive, smooth and fresh tasting, more malty than most offerings I had at the fest, but nothing really exciting here. Why does anyone make a ""cream ale"" these days?"
Black River Oh Be Joyfull Brown Ale;Proctorsville, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Black River Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes, this was poured into a mug. The appearance was a semi-dark brown color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that dissipated at a decent pace. Sly lacing. The aroma had some roasty nuts, caramel and toffee malts, and a subtle crisp crackery tone. Light earthiness. The flavor tries to blend most of the prior mentioned aromas but somewhat stays separated with the sweetness, the roast and then adds an earthiness that seems to lack that want of a great blend. Moderate nutty to semi-tart aftertaste (not sure why it was tart). Quick sly sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a slight sessionability about it. Decent carbonation. Roastiness keeps the tartness tame on my tongue. Overall, interesting brown ale, was thinking if the tanks weren’t properly cleaned when this was brewed, that tartness leaves me scratching my beard.
Black River Oh Be Joyfull Brown Ale;Proctorsville, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Black River Brewing Company;"On tap at the Vermont Brewers' Fest. Time was I loved brown ales; now I rarely order them. This one was very smooth, winelike, just a bit of nuttiness on the nose, hoppier than usual, rather decent. Would've liked to get back to these guys' tent."
Trout River Golden Ale;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trout River Brewing Company;"On tap at the Vermont Brewers' Fest. This is more like the TR I know and loathe. Very fizzy (artificial-seeming) thin, watery, paper-tasting dull shitty stuff. These guys managed to have both the best and worst beers of the fest; congratulations!"
Shed Honey Wheat;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Sampled Summer 2003 - Mild citrus aroma. Hazy straw coloured with decent white head. Sweet with a mild lemony flavour at the end. Low carbonation. Not very exciting. Sampled at the brewpub.
Shed Honey Wheat;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Wheat Ale;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the Vermont Brewers' Fest. Very sweet, but dull and flat with little wheat character.
Rapscallion Blessing;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;(Draft @ Union Brewhouse, server described it as a Belgian) Served in a shaker. Medium-dark amber, a bit hazy. Very thin off-white head. Aroma of light spice, banana, clove. Medium-textured. No real lacing. Medium bitterness overlays a somewhat fruity and lightly spicey base. A little bitter and yeasty in the finish. Meh.
Rapscallion Blessing;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;Very hoppy beer. Aroma is floral hops and some banana. Taste is bitter hops with dry finish. Very nice. Rated 10/1/04
Rapscallion Blessing;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;on tap @ GIBF, one of the only ones here that I wanted to taste, nice ASA, should open up this brewery to the rest of the world more. Nice spice hop character and taste, not overbearing.
Rapscallion Blessing;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;Bottle. Orange-copper hazy pour with tan head. Aroma of fruit and hops. Taste of citrus and caramel. Nice finish.
Rapscallion Blessing;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;(Draft) Pours a lightly hazy copper body with medium beige head. Aroma of peach, caramel, breadiness, banana, and light orange peel. Flavor of citrus/grassy hops, bread, caramel, and some unidentifiable fruit and vegetable notes.
Rapscallion Blessing;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;Bottle. Dark copper color, cloudy. Nice Off white head, little if any lacing but small foam lingers throughout. Some floaters and sediment, in cold storage for about 6 months but did not mar the taste. Aroma of caramel-hops. Malty yeast and hops pallet with a dry caramel bitter sweet flavor, no lingering bitter after taste. Good all around flavor and full body. Like to find this again.
Rapscallion Blessing;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;12oz bottle. Poured a deeper and lightly hazy amberish color wtih a huge sized off white head. Aromas of fruitiness, caramel, dark fruits, and light yeast. Tastes of caramel, dart fruits, lightly tart cherries, and burnt brown sugar. Light alcohol in the finish.
Rapscallion Blessing;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;12oz bottle, with no obvious freshness date - just an obscure code. Pours a surprisingly rich dark copper that I wasn’t expecting. Floaty chunks could be seen in the bottle before opening, but not once poured. Aroma is spicy and rather nice, but not particularly hoppy. Initial taste is crisp and sparkly from carbonation, that quickly blends into a nicely rich full taste. There’s a nice little bit of spiciness to the taste that is nicely balanced with the hops, along with some fruitiness. I am very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this beer. I thought that this was like an IPA, but I got something quite different and pleasing instead. I wish more were made like this. This was delicious.
Rapscallion Blessing;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;Poured a murky brownish amber color wit a small off-white head. The aroma was fruity and sweet. Smelled a little aged. Some sweet pineapple, aplles and golden raisins. Some citrus hops as well. Sugary. The flavor is sweet with old fruits, brown sugar and light hops. Medium to full body. Soft carbonation.

Black River Defiance Pale Ale;Proctorsville, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - English;Black River Brewing Company;Copper color with a large tan head. Light bitter hop taste with some sort of crap malt thrown in. Ugghh. My 2.0 rating on this is generous.
Black River Stump Jumper Stout;Proctorsville, Vermont, United States;Stout;Black River Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes since the brewery no longer exists. This was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a thin white foamy head that dies off at a decent pace. Light stringy lace. The aroma feeds rugged roasty coffee beans, some light coffee grounds, and some burnt cocoa beans. Light toast. The flavor yields to the coffee beans and grounds, robust and rugged. Keeps a crisp thin roasty malty aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Mild carbonation and the roastiness beats at my tongue in a good way. Overall, good stout worthy of having again but, well, that’s not going to happen, oh well.

Lake Placid High Peaks Hefeweizen;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;Transfer from BA review on 8-4-12- Poured from bottle into weizen glass Appearance – Pours a hazy orange color with a huge white head. The head faded relatively fast at first, but then formed a very persistent one finger foam. This thick foam lasted for some time but eventually did fade to give a moderate amount of lacing. Smell – Aromas of pepper, yeast and lemon are the heaviest. Mixed with these are aromas of wheat as well as a light banana smell. Taste – The taste begins big of wheat and yeast. These flavors are soon meet with a lemon and sweet orange citrus flavor which overall sweeten the flavor. These flavors carry the taste to it’s middle, where they are then met with some yeast and pepper flavors. These flavors intensify and take the taste to the end. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the medium side with a carbonation level that is rather average. Overall – A pretty tasty hefeweizen. It has nice sweetness that melds well with the yeasty, wheaty, and citrus flavors.

Lake Placid Bruces Brown Bag Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;Decent nose, leaving one excited about what’s to come. Poured very dark with thick head, unusual for a brown. Immediate sugar on the mouth, and lots of it. This leads way to a stingging hopeyness that is quite out of place in a brown. Nutts do poke through, with even a shade of cocao after the palate adjusts to all the sugar and bitter. Not one of the better browns I’ve tasted. I hope it simply wasn’t ruined by dirty pipes...
Lake Placid Bruces Brown Bag Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;From a fresh growler. Roasty, mildly sweet chocolately aroma with some metallic notes and a bit of piney hoppiness in the nose. Moderately transparent amber/mahogany color with a nice frothy tan head. Mildly sweet, roasted chocolate start, turning significantly piney and hoppy to finish. These appear to be Cascades. This is not to style at all and way overhopped, but it is still a decent-drinking ale.

Sweet malty start, sugary. Middle lends to some nice roasted malt character and some decent bitterness. The sticky sweetness stays on the tongue as the bitterness dances away. Nice complexity. This is one of the nicest brown ales I have tasted; its too bad that Lake Placid doesn’t brew this more often. It is hard to believe that I am the first to rate."

Aroma is very faint, with maybe a tad bit of hops. Start is mild, then turning into a moderate hop flavor. The end is of yeast flavor. Palate is good. Had this out of a growler from the brewery.
Lake Placid Ectoberfest;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;This is a very interesting brew. I don't really feel that is a representative of the Oktoberfest/Marzen style. Pours a deep garnet red color with a small off white head that dissipates fast. Smells chocolaty, roasted malts. Reminds me of a porter, sort of. Very little carbonation, definately can taste the malts, mostly roasted and/or burnt. Very little body in the middle, and it finishes with chocolate, nutty taste. I wonder if they labeled this growler incorrectly. It is not a bad beer by any stretch, but it is not representative of the style.
Lake Placid Dr. Foggs Stout;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Stout;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;Growler into pint glass. Pours a deep, dark black with a light tan head that dissipates quickly.

Lake Placid Dr. Foggs Stout;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Stout;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;Black pouring liquid with medium tan head. Aroma is roasted chocolate maltiness.

Lake Placid Dr. Foggs Stout;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Stout;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;Growler. Pours an opaque black with a nice sized tan head, which is slowly resolving. Aroma is the typical choco-coffee bouquet. Start is the same flavor as the aroma, which ends with some bitterness. Mild hoppy flavor towards the end as well. Could use a tad bit more body. All in all, a very good effort by Lake Placid.

Nova Scotia Stout;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Stout;Haus der 131 Biere;0,33l Flasche. Rötlich mahargoni frabenes Bier, luftiger beiger Schaum. Es sieht nicht aus wie ein Stout und es riecht auch überhauptnicht wie ein Stout. Eher wie ein Altfränkisch. Antrunk nussig und malzig. Schnell weg und sehr enttäuschend. Es handelt sich hier weder um ein Stout, noch um ein kanadisches Bier. Es soll auf ein Rezept und eine Lizenz der geschlossenen Gasthausbrauerei Queen Molly Brewery aus Yarmouth, Nova Scotia zurück gehen. Für mich leider dubios. Die gibts schon seit dem Jahr 2000 nicht mehr. Das müsste auf dem Etikett genauer erklärt werden!
Nova Scotia Stout;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Stout;Haus der 131 Biere;Butelka 0,33l kolor ciemny jak woda zabarwiona ciemnym barwnikiem. Piana znikoma. Aromat kwaszonej kapusty, ścierki i ciasteczek. W smaku ścierka i karmel słodki.Z lagerami afrykańskimi i karaibskimi może konkurowac, piwo tak słabe, że aż wstyd, że z Niemiec.
Nova Scotia Stout;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Stout;Haus der 131 Biere;"Ein schwaches Bier. Zunächst enttäuschend, da es nicht in Kanada gebraut wird wie auf dem vorderen Etikett angegeben, sondern im Auftrag des Hauses der 131 Biere von der Brauerei Strubbe aus Belgien produziert wird. Schade! Beim Einschenken fällt auf, dass das Bier sehr stark mit Kohlensäure durchsetzt ist, ein mächtiger Schaum baut sich auf. Die Farbe ist sehr dunkles Braun. Optisch gleicht es einem Stout, jedoch ist die Schaumkrone etwas zu weiß. Die Nase habe ich als sehr unangenehm wahrgenommen. Riecht ziemlich süß, aber diese unangenehme Art von süß. Jedenfalls gar nicht nach Stout. Der erste Schluck war absolut überraschend. Es hat mit einem Stout wirklich GAR NICHTS zu tun. Im Antrunk eine sehr kurze aber intensive Süße, direkt danach breitet sich eine undefinierbare Säure auf der Zunge aus. Im Nachtrunk schmeckt es dann einfach nur noch leer, kaum Bittere vorhanden. Es ist insgesamt ein Bier welches man trinken kann, aber dann darf man es keinesfalls als Stout deklarieren. Wäre es ausgewogener und würden die Braumeister die Säure aus dem Bier kriegen wäre es ein leichtes, trinkbares ""Dunkelbier"". Aber so wird es wohl bei einem einmaligen ""Vergnügen"" bleiben."

Ar-Men Brune;Trégunc, France;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Britt (Brasserie de Bretagne);Bottle. An orange-golden beer with a creamy, beige head. Milky, dusty, slightly citrusy nose with bakers yeast in the back. Caramel and some hops in the mouth, quite tasteful even though it bears the same symptoms of infection as the aroma. Medium body, quite effervescent. Even though it is going bad, it is a quite nice beer, but nothing special. (081003)

First impression is slightly sourish, lactic, but mixed with quite a bit of coloured, but still sweet malts, even chocolat malt. Sweet taste, quite malty, bit of dull chocolate, but always with a little spike of lactic-like acidity. Not very well-bodied, bit thin. Quite disappointin, as most Brittany’s black beers are very distinctive, and really tasting of the black grain. This one doesn’t."

Green Mill Grand Marais Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;On tap. Apparently this is the last batch of Green Mill beer that will ever be brewed...Although the beers were never good, I find that a little bit sad. Pours a nice copper gold color with a thin head. Decent hop in the aroma, but I’m getting mostly caramel malts. The flavor is really sweet and malty in kind of a pleasant way, tastes almost like caramel, but the hops keep it from being to much. A bit thin bodied, as others have noted, but a pretty decent beer overall.
Green Mill Grand Marais Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Pretty well done. Fairly light in color, pretty good lacing. Pretty good, yet light hop presence in the nose. Malt character was not so great all the way through. Hops were more present in the taste (citrusy & a little sprucy). A touch of malt sweetness comes through in the finish, but still remains slightly dry. This beer is a bit restrained and watered down, but still pretty good.
Green Mill Grand Marais Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Draft @ Brewpub: Copper color, light white head and nice lacing. Nose of citrusy hop and light husky malt, decent cascade note. Dry flavor, ok pale ale, a bit lacking in body, but it’s refreshing to have a drinkable beer in the lineup.
Green Mill Grand Marais Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;On tap at the St Paul brewpub (sampler). Pale copper colour. There is a hint of hop here but it is very restrained. Also a dab of sweet malt. Light body. Drinkable but distinctly underpowered. Third beer of the sampler and a pattern was beginning to emerge.

Green Mill Grand Marais Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Pours a lightly hazed golden color, served with an inch of white foam. Good head retention, solid lacing. Mild light sweet malt in the aroma. On the light side, but with a tasty and quite dry toasted malt flavor. Floral hops throughout, providing just a hint of residual bitterness. Good carbonation, easy to drink.
Green Mill Grand Marais Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Amber color with no head. Just a bit of malt in the aroma. There seemed to be a respectfully solid malt base for a pale ale. On top of that was some hops and a general dried flower taste. Pretty good!
Green Mill Grand Marais Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Super solid coppery color with a thin white head, faded fast, no real lace qualities. Smell is soft and faint of malt and floral hops. Taste is very nice, pleasantly mild hoppy bite with great malt backing, a touch of sweetness, very smooth tone and easily bittered lending through to a nice smooth dry finish. One nice, very relaxing and refreshing brew, yummy. Has a good solid medium body and light sweetish bittering dry ending. Highly drinkable and easy on senses. A solid offering regularly available year round.

Green Mill Swamp Buck Oatmeal Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;"As my glass was being poured from the nitro-tap, the beer was a dull ugly murky brown. My better half looked at it and said, ""What’s this one called? Swamp muck?"" But of course, that was just the cascading from the nitro tap that made it look that way. By the time it finished cascading, it was a beautiful near-black color, with a good 1""+ head of soft creamy tan head. The foam left pretty good lacing throughout the glass. OK, so it looks good. On to business... Mild roasted malt in the aroma. Mild roasted malt in the flavor. It finished very dry, more like a dry Irish stout than a smooth oatmeal stout. It tasted pretty good, but nothing exceptional. Not quite medium body, but the nitro pour smoothness was nice."
Green Mill Swamp Buck Oatmeal Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;More a dry than a sweet stout. The beer is black. Very light smoke in the aroma. Flavor is almost non existent, like watered down Guinness.
Green Mill Swamp Buck Oatmeal Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;"The bartender said something curious when I ordered this one, perhaps because I’d just finished their lager. ""It’s thick!"" he cautioned, as if I’d just asked for a pint of plutonium. Buddy, I gargle Old Rasputin, and I pour Expedition on my corn flakes! I’ve known me some ""thick stouts"", and this...was not one. Appearance, perfect black, with a well retained, thick, creamy head. Nose: smooth and creamy, with no flavors really presenting themselves. Taste: smooth, not much from hops, and good with the malt, but nothing really stands out at all. Very drinkable, but unremarkable, passes through rather lightly. In short, a good Guinness Draught clone. Nothing wrong with that."

Green Mill Swamp Buck Oatmeal Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;"Deep black, mostly dissipating head. Great aroma--coffee, chocolate, nice!

Green Mill Gunflint Gold;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;On tap at the St Paul brewpub (sampler). Pale gold with a thin white head. Not much going on in the aroma department. Or the flavour. Dull and anodyne. Too bland to offend.

Douar Men Rohane Ambrée;Cléguérec, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Celtik (formerly: Douar Men);Reddish colour with a decent head. Taste was caramel and some Belgianish esters (apricot), overall fairly sweet. Good creamy body. Dry finish. Not bad.
Douar Men Rohane Ambrée;Cléguérec, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Celtik (formerly: Douar Men);"The beer I drank was called Celtika Ambrée. Same ABV - so I presume this is the same beer. If anyone knows better, please tell me. Clear chestnut red; off-white, slightly irregular head. Caramel, pie with nuts, bit of leather in the nose.

Black Bull;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);this is the only beer real men drink. cheap as fuck and strong. most rating on this miss the whole point of the beer in the frist place. i hate beer snobs, this is a review for real drinkers.
Black Bull;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Bottle, frighteningly large. The following is a compilation of a dozen peoples’ thoughts who shared this brew with me at my first (and perhaps last?) Malt Liquor Dexterity Games Tournament to celebrate my birthday. Keeping in mind that most of the participants are not regular beer raters, here we go: Medium golden, corn syrup and fusels, harsh and awful. I’d rather suck on an old insole, fuck you black bull, shits ahoy, perhaps a proper pairing with a putrescent prairie oyster, indescribable.
Black Bull;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Its good beer. Little sips and its alright. I drink ANYKIND of beer that said being 10% alcohol has a diffrent taste. Kinda strong in big sips. Its extra strong beer. I rarly bash companies wi8th shitty ratings because if im drinking it and enjoying it must be excellant. Cant stand red beer. Black Bull is economic adn enjoyable in small sips
Black Bull;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Pour is a nice yellow, tiny head and lacing. smell is a boozy wet sweet corn hit right in your face, and apples. The taste is slightly acidic, maybe some vinegar too. Very chemical tasting. Corn and funky alcohol mix in the palate for a weird bitterness
Black Bull;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Huge 40 oz @ Hotel. Clear golden colored beer with a soapy white head. Not very good retention. Grape drink, booze, and corn syrup nose. Yum... Lots of cereal grain and corn flakes. Flavor is pretty sweet and is obviously high boost. Grape juice, corn, and a bit of soap. Light apple on the tongue, too. Pretty syrupy mouthfeel. Not a malt liquor I’d revisit.
Black Bull;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Avoèye la grosse Black Bull toé. (Silver Creek Brewing?) Donnons-y une chance, surtout que je n’ai plus de nouveauté à mettre sous la dent. Donc, elle est dorée et une mousse soyeuse s’accroche au verre en se résorbant. Des arômes fruités et maltés en émanent. Au travers, des effluves qui semblent être de miel, s’immiscent, mais ensuite, on est incapable de les percevoir à nouveau. C’est plutôt sucré en bouche. Des saveurs de poivre éventé arrivent avant que le monstre alcoolisé se fasse goûter et nous fait sortir des vapeurs d’alcool par les narines. Le gosier chauffe à chaque gorgée et on a le cervelet bien amoché. 3 piastres pour presque 1 litre! Ça fait pas cher la brosse. (1304-221014)
Black Bull;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);"Oh yaaa babee! In fact, I had avoided this during my days in Montréal since there were so many other favourable brews to sample there, and once on a snowey day of ""janvier"" I had found an emptied vessel of this amongst the snow-bound playgrounds of ""le plateau"" en Montréal.... but somehow, years later, I’m a few thousand kilometres away in Yellowknife and I find this gargantuan alcoholic monster at the local liquor store. These are simply rare expériences few and far between to be experienced! So, it pours into a hotel waterglass and has a surprisingly reliable bleach-white head and golden body. The aroma is cider. Pure cider - indeed it’s probably a mix of fusel alcohol, but it’s in fact a great cider aroma and if one was not expecting anything else, Monsieur Bull de noir would deliver in the cider department. The flavour - oh wow. It’s tinniness with this horrible aftertaste of tin and water. How’mever, as far as a brew like this goes, it’s pretty darned good - the flavour is unintrusive, even appetizing with the cider notes, and it goes down easy. It gets several extra points for its lack of total awfulness and I’d dare say that if one is among the streets of Montréal with a few bucks in their hand hoping to get wasted, this would be a solid choice. For connoissseurs indeed it is not, but this will get you f****ed up proper without much fuss. And for that, I commend their brewers. In not too many words."
Black Bull;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Black bull from black iPa on black malt licka Friday! Gold pour with a small white head. Boozy malts and grapes. Lots of sweet kiro syrup. Grainy. A bit of sweet butter and corn bread. Light finish, medium carbontation. Drinks more like an 8% 7.5/10 swillz.
Black Bull;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);1.18L clear bottle with screw off cap. Bright yellow colour, surprisingly large white head with a bunch of lacing, when it settles it still retains a nice foamy layer. Nose has a bit of orange, rough grains, cardboard, some fusel notes, not as harsh as I was expecting. Taste is sweet, again orangey, lots of harsh grains. Dryish finish, papery, some grain, lingering alcohol. Body is medium, even carbonation. Definately loses it’s charm as it warms, this is to be consumed as cold as you can make it. A total mess overall, but honestly I’ve had way worse than this, in the style and otherwise. A shaker and a half of this brew went down pretty easy, but I might just have a drinking problem.
Black Bull;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);1.18L bottle pours a pale golden color with a small white head that leaves no lacing. Aroma is skunk and grassy hops. Taste is skunky with a light malty sweetness and terrible hop bitterness. One of the worst beers ever made imho.
Full Sail Son of Spot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;From Jan 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! This pours from 22oz bottle a clear medium gold with a nice 2 finger head of foam. The foam recedes slowly but is still a solid layer deep into the session and it has a nice display of lacing. The smell is very hoppy but I'm also getting a whiff of sweetness along with the hops. The taste is very bitter. Pucker City! No sign of the sweetness I noted in the smell at all but the hoppy goodness does tickle my palate nicely. I'm noting a lot of grapefruit and some floral...and boy, that makes for a heck of a bitter IPA. It has a medium mouthfeel to it and the carbonation is fairly high. It finishes with a nice grapefruit zest and the aftertaste lingers on for quite some time. I usually prefer an IPA to be more balanced but when I'm in a hop head mood, this one fits the bill. Thanks again, John!
Full Sail Son of Spot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;sweet malt followed by some pine and a dash of grapefruit. i liked this better than Sunspot, the supposedly bigger beer.
Full Sail Son of Spot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle. Orange tinted gold, slightly hat, cream colored medium head. Aroma is sweet caramel malt and piney hops. Sweet barleycorn malt with resin and grapefruit hop character. I’m guessing this has malted out a bit, but it could also be the Full Sail skilled laborers missed the mark on this one by a little. Not bad, just not what it could have been.
Full Sail Son of Spot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Another dip into the never ending series of middle of the road IPA’s from FS. Tastes great, easy on the pocketbook, good every so often...but not too often.
Full Sail Son of Spot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Full Sail Brewing Company--Sun of Spot--Incredibly Bright India Pale Ale--Brewmaster Reserve 2007 22 oz. Bottle. 6.00% ABV--90 IBU’s. (4.25 / 5.0) IPA--Mild lacy head. Clear bright amber color. Medium floral hop front. Smooth mild sweet earthy caramel grapefruit pine mild ester body. Clean balanced mild hot hop spice end. Back of the Throat flowery Hops. Sampled 7/1/2007.
Full Sail Son of Spot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Golden orange and clear but there was some sediment at the bottom of the bottle so I think the next glass may be a little murky. A short, sticky white head is lacing the glass and leaving a thin film atop the beer. Aroma is hard to nail down but there is some hop stickiness there. Taste is similar to the regular IPA but hoppier with a decently bitter finish and bitter lemon flavor, minimal malt breadiness. The carbonation is healthy and active so the mouthfeel is a little bubbly. This is a good IPA, they should change the recipe of the regular IPA to this. This is much better than the sunspot IPA I had at the beginning of the year. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 08-27-2007 16:44:08
Full Sail Son of Spot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;The Dan Journal #258. Tasted 4/6/09. Purchased sometime during the summer of 2007. Hazy with an orange amber hue. Bubbled ring of head. Aromas of orange, resinous hops and fruity esters. Slightly vegetal. Medium bodied with moderate astringency and sweet malty character. Cola malts, but short lived. Dry and bitter finish. The grapefruit hop note really shines in the middle of the palate. Touch candy sweetness, but the astringent bitterness overshadows. Hits the palate well. Good rolling flavors, even at this age!
Full Sail Son of Spot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;22 oz. bottle. Shared with Gabe. Pours a nice white head, of long duration, over a clear (SRM 15) body....nose is pine and grapefruit.....taste initially is toffee malts then balancing resin, citrus and bitter hops....mouth feel is medium, carbonation medium. It is no question an American IPA, but is on the lighter and more refined end of that large spectrum.
Full Sail Son of Spot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Pours amber with a white head that lingers. Smells of sweet oranges, caramel, wildflowers, earthy. Tastes of earth, spice, tea, pepper, some bitterness on the finish.
Full Sail Son of Spot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;A- Pours an opaque orange honey hue, head is white fluffy foam that is mostly dissipating, minimal lacing S- Nose is quite hoppy with a subtle citrus (mostly orange) character, big tones of tea take over midway, some floral, herb, and spices, as well as bready malts T- Initial taste is mildly bitter hops which give way to tones of tea and biscuit malts, some chalk, grass, and earth characteristics M- Light-bodied ale, watery texture, sharp carbonation D- Easy-to-drink IPA at 6%abv that is fairly light on the hops and is surprisingly tea-like, I kept getting the essence of a hoppy iced tea, while this is unique it doesn’t hold up to most other IPAs in terms of the style characteristics, this is definitely non-offensive but in a bad way

Holsten Edel;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);From a bottle, pours a straw colour with a frothy white head. Quite carbonated, malty and a bitter, dry aftertaste on the palate. Compared to the usual Holsten this beer gives you a bit more flavour.

Quite sweet and lacking enough hops for balance. Finishes with a light bitterness and light metallic aftertaste. Decent mouthfeel, with a medium body and lively carbonation. All in all pretty poor.

De 3 Horne Bananatana;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;De 3 Horne;Sampled @ GBBF Day 2. Hazy murky orange to light amber color, no head.

Dovgan Dunkel 11;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Pivzavod AO Bavaria (Sun-InBev);Bought in a supermarket in Nordhorn that has a specific counter for Russians. There is a large Russian population in Nordhorn. I'm not quite sure about the brewery. Malty, chocolate, sulphury, strong barnyard aroma. Sweet and very skunky. Hardly drinkable.

Ramstein Revelation Golden Lager;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;High Point Brewing Company;Shared by Alex on a Friday night tasting...Pours a bright neon yellow, definetly highlighted by the clear east end growler that it is in. Pours with a suprising amount of carbonation for a growler, very good retention...The aroma is super hoppy, you can really tell it was dry hopped, maybe a tab bit too much hops. Almost smells like a true pilsner and I get a distinct hint of marjiuania on the finish....The taste is too hoppy for me and has a weird bite to it, I guess that’s from the dryhopped and cask combo. Has some lemon to it... A pretty crisp drinker. An interesting combo here, worth trying but probably wouldn’t drink this very often.
Ramstein Revelation Golden Lager;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;High Point Brewing Company;Pours a hazy golden with a smaller white head. Aroma of cheerios, light grains and noble hops. Flavor the same...really well done.

Ramstein Revelation Golden Lager;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;High Point Brewing Company;Draft at Craft Ale House. Pours turbid gold with off-white head. Nose is pale malt, citrus, wheat, and hops. Tastes citric, hoppy, with solid pale malt in the bill, plus some finishing sweetness and florals. Decent complexity makes this one a solid offering. Ramstein has never, ever let me down.
Ramstein Revelation Golden Lager;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;High Point Brewing Company;on tap-pours a white head and yellow color with effervescence.

Aroma is loaded with fresh bready pils malts, doughy, lightly yeasty, with a nice hint of herbal and slightly spicy noble german hops. More bready malt flavor- pure pilsner malts, lightly sweet, hints of grain, and light noble hop bitterness. Smooth as hell, but doesnt seem as though it could be under 4%. Maybe it has increased for this new batch? Awesome helles.

Schulten Bräu Pilsener;North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aldi Europe (Nord / Süd / Hofer);(500ml can, 0.29EUR, Berlin) AROMA: quite light pils/grain notes, so light that it is soft and inoffensive APPEARANCE: relatively pale straw yellow, short lived white foam TASTE: light grain, some green herbs/grass and celery, lightly bitter, hints of toasted grain bread and bland cheese PALATE: quite light except for the shadow of pils in the background, good fizz and some astringency, tiny bit round in the middle, easy malt/hop bitterness that fades quickly, tiny residual feel OVERALL: definitely a lighter version of a Pils, i guess lacking in the quantity of malt/hops used. however, it is drinkable and doesn't make me crunch my nose or wince. below average but presentable.

Schulten Bräu Pilsener;North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Aldi Europe (Nord / Süd / Hofer);Jedno z lepszych piw - nie tylko w tej cenie. Zalewani szczochami musimy je docenić. Wszelkie Lechowe Tyskie z Żywca łącznie z Warką wymiękają. Jak widzę kolejkę po Żubra po 1.2 EU za puszkę to wymiękam. Shulten wchodzi jak złoto. Najlepsze na finiszu. Zgazowane w granicach normy - trochę czuć kłucie na gardzieli lecz idzie się przyzwyczaić. Za te 0,42 UE / 0,5L (cena przy kracie) chyba nie znajdziesz lepszego. HIT i tyle - ALDI to wie. Tyle powinno kosztować piwo. Dobre piwo. Kto nie wierzy niech się napije Harnasia.
Hidden River Black & Tan;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Cold Spring Brewery;Deep amber brew with hardly any cap formed but it almost all stayed for the duration and left some messy lacing on swirls. Nice blend of aromatic malts, caramel, coffee and quite sweet with some hop smell. This is a really drinkable beer - one that could be consumed in mass quantities. Taste could be better and less watery but is still flavourful with its yummy sweet malts with caramel notes, underlying coffee and somehting that I cannot place. With that said, this black and tan lacks any depth. Mouthfeel is really smooth...almost too smooth - velvety. A bit dry but a well balanced bitterness is quite noticable. Medium bodied. Leaves a toasted malt aftertaste. A good beer with good malt flavour. The bottle claims it is a blend of a stout and a bock...er...just because there is a hint of coffee?
Hidden River Black & Tan;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Cold Spring Brewery;9-29-07 bottle. Clear light brown color with average head. Watery and very bland taste. Quite flat. So watery and flavorless.
Hidden River Black & Tan;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Cold Spring Brewery;Old bottle, perhaps not fresh... Pour is very clear light copper...Not like a stout at all. Medium off white head. Smell is slight roast malt, metal. Taste is wow, terrible. Watery, very bland, pure shit. this beer is awful. fuckers...
Hidden River Black & Tan;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Cold Spring Brewery;Light mahogany pour with minimal head. Aroma is mostly malty with some undertones of nuts. Flavor is poor...quick burst of malt flavor up front and then turns into water...for a split second I thought someone had put a Bud Light in front of me. Picked these up solely due to a special in price, and I can understand why. In no way is this representative of a Stout...
Hidden River Black & Tan;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Cold Spring Brewery;355ml bottle. Sweet caramel and nutty aroma, pours with a deep bronze hue and reasonable head. Sweet honey, nutty and slighty woody flavours. Very smooth on the palate with a dry finish.
Hidden River Black & Tan;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Cold Spring Brewery;355ml brown bottle. Poured a deep amber colour, head was thick and tan. Aroma has honey malt and caramel. The beer has a sweet edge to it, a lot of caramel malt flavour, slight hop character, some floral notes. Syrupy body with little carbonation. More bock than stout in this mix.
Hidden River Black & Tan;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Cold Spring Brewery;Same deal as presario: this was in an international mixed pack from United Distributors. Definitely not a stout in any way. It pours a deep amber with an off-white head. Aroma is all caramel malt with a subtle earthy tone. Palate is much the same, with the earthy quality coming forward a little more, reminiscent of an English pale ale more than anything. Not a bad beer at all, but not a stout in my opinion.
Hidden River Black & Tan;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Cold Spring Brewery;A World of Beer selection all the way from Minnesota. One of 5 new beers in this pack. Copper with a lasting light head. Interesting nose with roasted scents with a traditional amber vanilla-caramel. It tastes like a little better than normal amber with thin butterscotch almost like sucking on a Werthers while drinking water. Not sure about the stout classification for this one. A bit of a metallic trace in the finish.
Hidden River Black & Tan;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Cold Spring Brewery;"..yes, this beer is on the lower end of ""stouts"" but u really have to give it a chance and you really have to drink this when u feel like it.I drank this with a slight non coldness..hated it...drank it at the end of a night with some winners(guinness+scaldis) ...hated it ....BUT, when i sat down at home, with a guinness glass and served this at the right temp and under the right circumstances...this was quite nice, has a nice tan head that laces adequatly..pleasing sweet coffee,honey (slight)hop smell...and a nice bitterness to go along with a pleasing sweetness, an average beer that deserves a chance...but don’t be expecting a guinness+harp B+T!!"
Hidden River Black & Tan;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Cold Spring Brewery;This was reminiscent of Amber Bock, with no discernable flavors of each style like you would expect from a black and tan. Slightly sweet in the sense that it was almost syrupy, with some background roastiness and caramel.
Heidelberg;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"Back in the day...when this stuff was brewed in the state of Washington it was one of the hoppier beers we could get. It also had the distinction of being sold in ""keg"" shaped bottles which were cool."
Heidelberg;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;This came in cool bottles, but it was mostly good for cheap drinking at parties
Heidelberg;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;This was another of the cheap beer I used to steal from daddys stash. He drank whatever was the cheapest that day. I remember this to be one of the better ones
Heidelberg;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Lots of great memories from this lager. 3 cases for ten dolars. The taste was a little watery but it looked and tasted like beer. Pretty good for a cheap beer. Good value.
Heidelberg;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Heidelberg, the cheap beer that never stops giving. Unfortunately, I live in Montana where Heidelberg is not sold, so I don’t have the luxury of drinking this beer on a consistent basis. However, when I do go to Idaho (where this beer is available) this is pretty much all I drink, everyday. This beer is especially good in hot weather in the middle of the summer. My brother, father, and I spent 2 1/2 days at a lake spot in Idaho this summer and went through six 12 packs (12 packs of cans are all they come in these days) of this excellent cheap beer, never coming close to dehydration in 100 degree weather (However I wouldn’t recommend going 2 1/2 days drinking nothing but beer). Throughout those 2 1/2 days I experienced a sweet taste that wasn’t too filling. This is a very drinkable beer that doesn’t have a bizarre numbing after taste to it. I could drink this beer every weekend of the year. However that won’t be the case because you cannot purchase it in Montana. All in all, I stand firmly in saying that this is one of the best cheap beers you will ever taste.
Heidelberg;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"Whew, haven’t voluntarily drunk a beer this bad since my wasted youth when this sort of stuff was known as ""Lawn mowing"" beer & Coors (if you could find it) passed as a microbrew. Still, for the former category, it was a decent chaser/thirst slaker. Says it was made from ""NW waters"", probably a label design holdover from the days it was brewed in the Sea-Tac area (didn’t drink it then but once or twice). I traded a can of e-Bud (see my other review today) I had just picked up (this time @ $12/case, its growing on me!) for 2 of these while doing another dock sale nearby. A fair trade, I’d say. Not much point in parsing my ratings except as a scientific excercise."
Heidelberg;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Ok had wondered about buying this ( as it only comes in 12 packs) for a while.I hardly see it, only in a few grocery stores, though I hear once it was a quite popular beer in the PNW. I am afraid its not a terribly good looking beer poured into a glas , pale cooking oil yellow colour, large white head that dissapears in an instant leaving little. Smell is mainly sweet maltiness..corny. Flavour is not that bad really..when very cold..its all malts of course, quite sweet,semi dry finish with some bitter aftertaste whic i doubt is hops. KInda thin and watery on the palate. Its drinkable in hot weather ,outdoors( i was camping)..but would not reach for this again
Heidelberg;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;This is crap. I was not at all suprised to find out Miller brews this, as it has a dominant rotting corn flavor just like MGD. I am ashamed that I bought a whole 12 pack of this!!
Heidelberg;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Nice fresh malty aroma,crips clean flavor with a malty overtone,good mouthfeel and throat feel.Very clean finish.Smoothe all the way.
Heidelberg;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"Decent, average American lager. Not much taste and slightly watery, so I''d say it is about comparable to Coors. This was a once-common Pacific Northwest regional brand originally brewed at the Heidelberg plant in Tacoma, Washington. After that brewery closed, Rainier in Seattle picked up the brand, but it became increasingly hard to find even in its native Northwest. With the Rainier brewery closing I''m not sure if it''s even being made anymore. Worth picking up if you run across it. A good ""thirst quencher"" beer."

Tetleys Festival Ale;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Bottle 19/04/2004 Amber mid brown coloured malty and sweet with a slightly dry bitter lasting finish.
Tetleys Festival Ale;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Highly carbonated which made it seem like drinking with a knife against your tongue.Reasonable appearance but any trace of flavour had been taken away by the effects of a blow torch. Why did they bother.
Tetleys Festival Ale;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Hoppy light aroma. Deep red hue, decent foamy white head. Rusty malt taste with hop finish. A thin second rate ale.
Tetleys Festival Ale;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Bottled, Pasteurised. Browny red with beige big head. Unfortunate overstewed flavours like trying to get the last drop from a teabag. Bitter but cooked malt. Not a good bitter.
Tetleys Festival Ale;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Kinda red colored. Big fat head like me. Not really lacy. Definative caramel aroma. Caramel taste with hints of butter or toffee. Not very complex and a bit off balance. Dry finish without a hoppy bite. Not as good as the English ale.

Dent Kamikaze;Dent, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dent Brewery;Served via cask dispense at the Sussex Arms, Twickenham Green(Feb ’12). Dispensed into a UK half pint jug to a clear amber/gold colour with a thin white head which soon subsided to a small pond on top - around the edge of the glass. On the nose, caramel a little yeast and some fruit aroma, but not particularly strong in any area. Taste wise more going for this beer than the smell! Sweet malt, caramel, bready, a little yeast and a bitter hoppy dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel was decent enough, low carbonation, medium to full in body. Overall - an OK beer but not something I’ll be looking to actively seek out again!
Dent Kamikaze;Dent, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dent Brewery;Aroma of fruit and bread. Deep gold-copper color with full beige head. Nice mouthfeel, dominant hops, notes of honey and orange.
Dent Kamikaze;Dent, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dent Brewery;12th Feb 2012: Sunday lunchtime session at The White Hart, Shifnal, Shropshire. Hand pulled pint. Light amber body with an off-white which started thin and got even thinner as the beer level sank down the glass. Mixed bag of aromas: all weak, hints of malty sweetness and fruit as well as hop citrus notes. The taste was also a mixture, thankfully stronger than the smells: Dried fruits, biscuit malts and a mini hop bitterness towards the end of each gulp. Not a world beater, but well worth trying if you ever see it
Fantôme Automne;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;750, corked and capped. Thanks, M! Pours a cloudy medium amber with a loose white head. Light caramel and a bit of vague grassiness and some light pencil shavings on the nose. Creamy medium body, soft carb, goes a bit watery in spots. Light caramel and pencil shavings mid palate. Earthy finish.

Fantôme Automne;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;Bottle at Scott’s Summer Saison tasting 2014. Pour is lightly hazy orange with a small white head and decent lacing. Dusty, funky, herbal, orange juice, bready and grainy aroma. Taste is tangy, orange juice, lemons, stone fruit, basil and herbs with a lightly tart finish. Medium body with soft carbonation. Decent stuff.
Fantôme Automne;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;Bottle @ Doodler. A little murky orange appearance with a thin tan head. Fairly spicy and herbal nose with some orange and citrus. Somewhat tart flavor with lemon juice, guava, and apricot. A little bready and funky. Interesting.
Fantôme Automne;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;The autumn version in the series of ’four season Fantômes’, with thick, stable, creamy, yellowish beige head and dark bronze colour with orange hue, hazy, but fully clouded after addition of the deposit. Spicy aroma of ginger, pepper, grapefruit, thyme, kiwi, sour cherries, earth, wood, dried leaves, bread, wine vinegar. Tingling fruitiness in the onset but only lightly sweetish, dry spicy middle, citrus freshness, lactic acidity, long bitter finish with cheesy hops and a yoghurt-like sourishness that cloys a bit. The beginning of the bottle also had a noticeable cork taste, which fortunately disappeared after adding more of the beer. Weird as ever, a kind of special saison, but not my favorite as far as this brewery is concerned.
Fantôme Automne;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;Bottled. Pours hazy amber with an average off-white head. Aroma of caramel, yeast, banana notes, citrus, peach, cloves and corriander and some funk too. Slightly sweet flavor that ends up dry a close to tart and with bitter notes. Medium bodied, watery to oily texture and soft carb. A very nice and complex Saison.
Fantôme Automne;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;Reviewed from notes. Received in a trade with jsquire, thanks a bunch for the great trade Jeff! No discernible vintage found on the bottle, but it has the old paper labels typically seen in the early to mid 2000’s. Pours a murky brown in color with a ring of soapy off-white head around the glass. Nose shows very little oxidation, more along the lines of malt, citrus, orange peel, and some slight metallic notes. Flavor is malty and somewhat cocoa-y, with a fairly pleasant tart, citric finish. Very well rounded flavor. Moderate mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a lingering acidity. Much better than I expected, quite a pleasant surprise on the day. You need to make this again Dany!
Fantôme Automne;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;The original is better! Similar taste and aroma with some metallic hints and special malts.
Fantôme Automne;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;750mL bottle, courtesy of julian, pours a dirty, cloudy amber / mahogany with a tiny beige head. Aroma seems a tad oxidized and very malty, with dry cherries, some tannic qualities, and a bit of red wine vinegar. Flavour of red wine vinegar, tobacco, and leather most dominantly, and some dry caramel or toffee a little later. The oxidized qualities certainly show as well but definitely don’t kill it. While this has certainly passed its prime, the leather and tobacco notes help save this. Doesn’t strike me a saison, more like a Belgian amber ale. Very interesting one.
Fantôme Automne;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;Bottle a couple years back. Hazy golden pour with huge and ultra fluffed out white head. Lacing was small to medium. Aromas of lemon rind, and other citrus dominant fruits. Other notes of belgian spice, vinegar, and light cocoa powder. Taste is similiar with a green apple and lemon flavor with honey, malt, and hop bitterness. Somewhat dry but worked well with the beer. Nice and woody. Will try again.
Vermont Pub Harts Bend McIntosh Amber;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Pub & Brewery;One of the best tasting ciders I've ever had. Crisp, strong apple taste and smell. Unlike most ciders though it maintains a nice amber color and you can drink more than one in a sitting. Last I heard it's only available in VT and PA because such a small quantity is made.
Abbotsford Invalid Stout;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);I love stout! This one is the decent that I have taste. Unlike from NZ, some stout there has an alcohol aftertaste. moderate to strong malt aroma. a very little alcohol may be noticeable. white head marks to the glass and keep stay on top. creamy dark brown to black. the rich flavor of toasted malt caramel chocolate coffee almond and notice of bitter aftertaste.
Abbotsford Invalid Stout;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Incredibly poor ratings given this is one of the very few remaining beers a major brewer has no need to keep brewing. It is a brew, though adjusted and cheapened as a product, that still has that subtle nuances and complexities that just taste of years gone by. Into its own middy at cellar temperature. Black as midnight with only a deepest, darkest brown showing in the very shallows. Satin shine to the tannish, tight foam atop that lasts and leaves a very fine lace. Aroma is dominated by toasted almond meal and Ovaltine™ drops with hits of marzipan, milk chocolate, Dutch cocoa powder, salted caramel and beef OXO™ cubes with an enveloping note of damp loam and rock moss - considerably complex. Creamy and full on the palate, soft in carbonation. Smoky version of the nose on the palate. Peppery, twiggy bark and charred wood meets the ’Hell’s Kitchen’ version of a great ganache of chocolate makes up the most. Long, long aftertaste of ashen malt, bitter Dutch cocoa, top-soil, roasted almonds and raw, milled peanuts. A true ’swish around your mouth and be perplexed by’ ale I’m always impressed by. Maybe it is a taste of home as I am Victorian through and through, but maybe it is just the fact they are still brewing this. Delicious!!! (37,5cL, BB 12/01/19, Lord Newry, Fitzroy North, Victoria)
Abbotsford Invalid Stout;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);330ml bottle from Gladstone Park Hotel, Melbourne. Black color with not much head to speak of. Malty aroma. Taste is vague roasted malt with coffee note but other wise thin palate. Meh.
Abbotsford Invalid Stout;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Awesome bouquet. Pours black with nice tan head. A touch thin though.

Abbotsford Invalid Stout;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Mild fruity aroma. Pours a lovely near black colour with a tan head that fades. Thinner on the palette than some stouts but pleasant none the less. Flavour is roasted malt, fruits and spices. Not my favourite stout but still a pleasure to drink.

Abbotsford Invalid Stout;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Stout;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);"375mL bottle. Reduced to Clear at local Woolworths Liquor Deep near-black body, thin film of tan foam sticks around. Moderate intensity aroma; cocoa, molasses, some woody hop and bready yeast. High carbonation, bit thin and watery for strength and style, dries out quite quickly. More cocoa on the body, bit of liquorice, flavour drops away to reveal a bit of yeasty ""CUB"" twang that lingers with a moderate bitterness. Disappointing; certainly not on par with other macrobrewed Aussie stouts."

Der Nachgeschmack ist leicht säuerlich, muffig-flach, ganz leicht herb-süßlich. --> eher enttäuschendes Märzen. Schade! --> 6/6/5/5

Uttendorf Premium;Uttendorf, Austria;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Privatbrauerei Vitzthum;0,33l gree glass bottle at home. BB 10.03.2016. very nice brown hazy color with a light redish touch, small off-white head. smells malty sweet, some caramel, dark fruits, light plums, some berry notes, a bit of honey, smells of light vegetables / very lightly skunky. there are light off notes on the smell, but still OKish. medium body, medium carbonation, slick mouthfeel. tastes tobacco, citric, caramel, light fruity, plums, a bit astringent towards the finish. finishes rather light and quite boring with tobacco and dark fruity notes. not a fan of this one, there are some light off-notes on the smell and the taste just fades away on the finish and does not drink very good at all. I guess the green glass bottle did not help to improve the beer.
Uttendorf Premium;Uttendorf, Austria;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Privatbrauerei Vitzthum;Bottle in DE. Pours well, keeps a small head on the 5 min test.

Georg-Braeu Hell;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauhaus Georgbraeu;Well-made draft beer with nice, continuous foam. Aroma is slightly characterized by yeast as well as light notes of caramel malt. The taste is unsurpassed fresh with a little taste of yeast, light caramel malt, straw and a pleasant balanced hoppiness. It has long aftertaste, but its biggest character is probably the freshness that reveals that it comes directly from the brewery and into the bar’s beer taps. Fantastic delicious and I would like to go far to taste again if I go to Berlin another time.

Georg-Braeu Dunkel;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Brauhaus Georgbraeu;This dark lager has volatile foam and a aroma of dark and crispy caramel malt. The taste is caramel followed by a pleasant hollow aftertaste in fine balance. Having just enjoyed an excellent Helles from the same brewery, this beer can easily seem a bit dull and anonymous, but it may be because there are great expectations when the Helles tops as it did for me. Had the order of the two beers been reversed, this beer might have received another attention from my side. The palate is good, the balance is fine, but it does not fully affect the same brewery’s fresh Helles.

Ellicottville Eville Amber Ale;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ellicottville Brewing;Tap at Governors Island Brew Fest, summer 2010. Pours amber-red with a medium, off-white head. Nicely balanced all around. Aroma holds some caramel malts and citrusy hops. Flavor begins sweet and malty before giving way to some citrus an earth bitterness. Light to medium in body with average carbonation. Finishes with a nice malt profile and some lingering hops. Nice.
Ellicottville Eville Amber Ale;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ellicottville Brewing;"Presentation: It was poured into a notched pint glass from the tap at the Ellicottville Brew Pub’s Fredonia Location. Appearance: The body had a good deep amber colored body (duh) with good clarity and some visible carbonation. It carries a small one finger head on top which is just off white in color. It hangs on till about the half way point and makes some nice lace rings near the top of the glass. Buy the end it manages only a thin film. Smell: There are decent citrus and piney hop notes with some hints of sweet malt underneath. Taste/Palate: It starts on a mildly sweet malty base with an equal balance of citrusy and mellow piney hops quickly moving in. The hops add a good balance of bitterness and then fade off quickly in the finish. It has an easy drinking soft medium body and smooth texture. Notes: This for me this was a good all around beer. It’s not a ""wow"" beer but it is one that I could drink a few of and be quite happy."

Ellicottville Black Jack Dry Stout;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Ellicottville Brewing;Draft at 'the beer market' with Patty. A very dark brown pour with a fluffy nitro head. Coffee and dark malt roast aromas. Flavor is much dark roasted malt with some coffee. Thin easy going body.
Ellicottville Black Jack Dry Stout;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Ellicottville Brewing;On tap at brewpub On a warm summer day this stout offered a change of pace with a fresh malty bill. It remains mostly unremarkable though with nothing to set it apart. If big stouts are your thing you probably have to go further south around the lake to Jamestown. Otherwise for hanging out by the water there are worse choices. Aroma / Appearance - The fluid black base rests under mocha head. Black coffee smells like cooling liquid at dawn after a full day (and night) of road tripping. It gets the feel right without much fanfare. Flavor / Palate - Smoke and mild sweetness slowly work their way across the palate. The bitterness eventually goes a bit too far with a texture of burnt toast. Overall the experience remains weak even for a light stout. I would probably still give it a shot again though if I visited either of the other two locations.
Ellicottville Black Jack Dry Stout;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Ellicottville Brewing;Transfer from BA review on 3-29-13- Served on nitro tap in a pint glass Appearance – The beer is served a cola brown bordering on black color. Upon serving there is a cascade of bubbles streaming through the brew producing a one finger cream colored head that has a decent level of retention, with it fading over about three minuets to leave a decent level of lace on the sides of the glass and a persistent small film on the top of the brew. Smell - The aroma is very light overall with just hints of lightly toasted malt and coffee as well as a bit of earthy hop. Taste-The taste begins with a roasted malt and light cocoa flavor. The taste is rather dry upfront with a bit of sweetness of a caramel taste coming through in the middle. The caramel is short lived however and fades again more toward the end. With the advent of some slightly bitter roasted coffee and more cocoa joining the roasted malt base, a dry and very lightly bittered flavor is left to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – Being a nitro, the body of the brew is on the creamier side with a carbonation level that is well… creamy from the nitro. The thicker feel from the nitro is nice of the roasted and dry flavors of the brew, but is overall rather normal for a dry Irish stout on nitro. Overall- Not a bad dry Irish stout, but nothing all that exceptional. It is very Guinness like in flavor only a little bit richer and more intense.
Ellicottville Black Jack Dry Stout;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Stout - Dry;Ellicottville Brewing;It was black as night, thick and opaque. The nitro tap creates a thick and very creamy dark tan head. This smooth tightly packed head lasts forever and coats the glass with lace as I drink. The aroma has a dark roasted/toasted malt character with notes bitter bakers chocolate, earthy minerals and light herbal hops. The easiest way to describe it is to call it Guinness’s bigger brother. It has a good medium body with nice roasted and toasted maltiness which briefly hints at some sweetness. There are flavor notes of bitter dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee with a mineral edge that seems to come with all nitro tapped beers. The hops also add some light herbal notes and pleasant bitter dryness. Its texture and carbonation are extremely smooth and velvety.

Fourth Street SueBee Honey Ale;Sioux City, Iowa, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fourth Street Brewing Company;Rated from memory of the beer back in 2003, and in memory of Sioux City’s pioneering brewpub. This was probably my first honey ale, and it still leaves a favorable memory. A bit of honey on the nose, from a fizzy head over a golden body. Tate was sweet, with a slight edge of honey, but not overwhelming. It had just a bit of dryness, enough to prevent the sugar excess I usually find in a golden ale. I had always hoped this would come back under a different name, but I guess SueBee corporate decided against lending their name to an alcoholic beer.
Fourth Street SueBee Honey Ale;Sioux City, Iowa, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fourth Street Brewing Company;In the bottle. Pours a translucent gold. White head which remains, but no lacing at all. Aroma strong of sweet honey. Very pronounced honey flavor. Good body, good taste. I can’t imagine someone not liking this ale. This is no braggot, but definitely as good as a commercial honey ale is going to get what with the sky-high price of honey right now. Might be worth a road trip to Sioux City to see if this stuff is on tap (maybe Schell does not keg it?).
Fourth Street SueBee Honey Ale;Sioux City, Iowa, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fourth Street Brewing Company;Small white head that maintains a good fizz up top, clear pale golden body. Aroma is light with sweet cookie/honey malt and light hops. Taste is slightly tart (maybe) followed by some sweet honey character. Mouthfeel is ok. Definitely not watery... but could be thicker. Nothing major sticks out, except for the pleasant sweetness. Pretty enjoyable overall.

The aroma was made up of honey and malty notes. The mouth feel was smooth somewhat thick and even from start to finish with a lasting honey aftertaste and a flavor of malted honey. A very interesting flavor to say the least. Much stronger than some honey lagers I have had.

Boundary Bay Amber;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boundary Bay Brewery;Poured into a nonic pint glass, the appearance was a mostly clear bronzed light amber color with a white foamy rocky head. Lots of foamy messy lace. The aroma starts off with sweet and roasty nuts. Crisp bitter grassy hops. The flavor blends for the most part between sweet and roasty. Bitterness carries underneath for balancing purposes. Lingering nutty malt aftertaste. Quick dry roasty nutty finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt just right. Overall, nicely done amber ale worthy of coming back to.

Nutty malt aroma makes this inviting. Non-sweet finish makes this different. Overall an enjoyable beer here.

Grimbergen Cuvée de l'Ermitage Union;Alken, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken);"Cuvée de l’Ermitage belongs to that gallery of classic 20th-century Belgian ales which are now a thing from a near-forgotten past, but it was the beer that basically supported the Union brewery from the fifties onwards, when individualistic ’specialty’ beers were not yet commonplace in this country. Alken-Maes took over in 1978 and eventually put it under their own Grimbergen range in a sweeter, brighter coloured and less strong version, but even that could not prevent it from going extinct and this classic Belgian kicked the bucket in 2010. I had this Union version back in the early nineties in young condition, must have been one of the very first beers I took a brief note of, so the name kind of fills me with nostalgia... It was a clear brownish-tinged bronze coloured beer with foamy head and smooth caramelly malt character with dried fruit and spicy notes, in the end developing a noteworthy toasted bitterness supported by hops; my palate not being educated yet at the time, I even remember finding it too bitter for my liking... This demonstrates how beer education is very strongly a matter of opening your mind and acquiring tastes, as I am convinced I would probably find it rather bland if I could taste it young and in exactly the same form now, a quarter of a century later. This rating is therefore not to be taken too literally, as it is hugely anachronistic, but I thought it would be interesting to have a piece of nostalgia among all those ratings, a tribute to one of the first idiosyncratic Belgians and a contemplation on how drastically the beer palate evolves among dedicated beer afficionados..."

Only The Best Mine Shaft Stout;Divide, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Only The Best Brewing;Had this beer on 4/24/2003. Aroma is like a Red Ale not a Stout. Color is a deep amber. Good carbonation and a thin head. Taste is light and roasted. Strting with a light body it goes down crisp. Finish is light with a roasted taste backed by a mild bitterness. In the end its not a bad beer but it sucks as a stout.
Only The Best Mine Shaft Stout;Divide, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Only The Best Brewing;"Clear and burgundy-brown; quickly fading head. Body was kind of light (more like a schwarzbier or even a dark lager), but it had a nice carbonation level. Big roasty and toasty aromas throughout. Notes of dark toast, nuts and chewy toffee. Decent bitterness and a little burntness at the end. Hops exude some grass and pine. Decent beer."
Only The Best Mine Shaft Stout;Divide, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Only The Best Brewing;Coffee, sour aroma. Slight roastedness. Very dark red color. Roasted taste, medium body.
Only The Best Mine Shaft Stout;Divide, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Only The Best Brewing;Brown. Aroma of dusky, hearty grains giving hints of roasted malts, chocolate and fruits. Thin and very light body. Excessivly fruity and quite odd. A short note of burnt malts and chocolate. An average beer.
Only The Best Mine Shaft Stout;Divide, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Only The Best Brewing;Head is initially small, fizzy, light brown, fully diminishing. Body is dark brown. Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, chocolate), with a light note of wet rocks. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Bland, but not terrible.
Only The Best Mine Shaft Stout;Divide, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Only The Best Brewing;Excessive foam on the pour. Slightly winey nose, mellowwing out to Belgian chocolate and a light roast. Sweet intensely chocolaty palate, creamy and easy drinking. Very little bitterness or roastiness. Remaianing chocolaty into the aftertaste.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Blueberry Ale;Tokyo, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Ishikawa Brewery;Reddish-purple color, slight head. Subtle hints of blueberry. A little on the sour side.
Ellicottville Weissbeer;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ellicottville Brewing;On tap @ Brewpub 7/08 - This beer was listed a Summer Wheat at 5.2% ABV. Hope its the same beer. Pours a hazy straw color with no head. Flavor and aroma is typical German Hefe (banana and spice). Light body. Nothing special, but a drinkable beer.
Ellicottville Weissbeer;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ellicottville Brewing;On tap @ EBC Brewing Ellicottville. Average hefe. Looks the part but taste seems off. Aromas are somewhat there( bananas clove lemony citrus, etc) but taste seems a bit off & not smooth enough.
Ellicottville Weissbeer;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ellicottville Brewing;draf @ buffalo brewfest. cloudy brown-yellow. nice citrus yeast aroma. light carbonation over wheat, citrus and banana with a pleasant light bitter. pretty spot on the style and the bitter was a nice addition. haven’t been super impressed by EBC in the past but this one’s got some depth. nice job.
Ellicottville Weissbeer;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ellicottville Brewing;"Says ""Ebel's"" on the label. Slightly hazy orange with a quickly fading head. Light and clean on the tongue. Nice clove aroma throughout. Malts were light and doughy, with a vanilla sweetness in the background. Light hops with very little bitterness. Had some nice tart things going on. Finished somewhat dry. Overall, not bad, but kind of held back."
Ellicottville Weissbeer;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ellicottville Brewing;not very impressed with this but i never am with weiss's. As far as taste goes this one seemed to lack a little somethin. I mean it was definately drinkable jus not my thing though
Ball Premium Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;"I’m rating this based on a sample I had at the Toronto Festival of Beer a few years ago. Normally, I don’t rate from memory (unless it’s only been a day or two), but in this case I don’t think it matters much. It was a pale yellow colour with a grainy, slightly skunky aroma and a bland, very lightly bittered flavour. Basically, Coors Light in a cooler looking package. I remember thinking ""wow, what a useless beer - I bet it won’t last"". A couple of years later, the brand disappeared."
Ball Premium Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Bottle. This stuff is awful. it's translucent light golden in appearance with no head. Corn aroma, skunky...flavour is so bland, almost like drinking water. I can't imagine why anyone would want to drink this stuff.
Ball Premium Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Toronto Festival of Beer - Read some of the other reviews and i think my initial assessment may reflect the fact that it was #11 in the day. Pretty lacklustre, but has more flavour than most light beers. (But thats not saying much)
Ball Premium Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;(Bottle) Quote from the label - How about having a Ball? Maybe not - the fact that these are in a clear bottle and I had to blow dust off the box before bringing it to the cash makes me nervious. Can a beer be both premium and light? Ah, the questions. Pours virtually no head and a pale straw body. Skunk aroma with slight grass. Flavours of water and uninspiration. Finishes with an unsatisfied customer…
Ball Premium Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Pathetic look. There was almost no head, pale straw. Lovely skunky aroma mixed with freshly harvested grass. Watery, unimpressive, no life, no character .
Ball Premium Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Grassy aroma, straw colour, incredibely short lived head. Little flavour, teeny bitterness, poor.
Ball Premium Light;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;I don't know what the deal with this is. someone gave me one at a party and told me it was sooooo good for a light beer and actually had a lot of flavour. I just don't get it. how can any brewery try to make a light beer come across as good? pale yellow, little to no head. very faint sweet aroma and flavour. thin. perhaps a little hoppier than most lights, but still crap. for people who don't like beer.

Lucky Lager Force 10;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Another victim of M.A.D no longer available in Ontario, harsh if you are not ready for it, but a good cheap buzz in it’s day... I miss it so much. was only 3.90 for a 40 oz in it’s day. Taste wise not so good but for it’s price at the time and a cheap buzz only Black bull beats it.
Lucky Lager Force 10;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Oh sweet lord this is rough. I reall’y don’t have time for this stuff. It’s really very chalk full of chemicals in the aroma, with lots of canned corn. Pours a deep yellow with a rice infused head. Very harsh, with notes of sweet veggies and lots of booze. Why is this being made?
Lucky Lager Force 10;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"No discernable malt or hops. Could easily be mistaken for a vodka and water mix. I didn’t detect any harsh off flavours either; the alcohol was able to take centre stage for better or worse."
Lucky Lager Force 10;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Terrible. Smells awful, Looks awful and tastes awful. I’d rather drink Coors or Bud than this again.

Lucky Lager Force 10;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Very overrated, I can't believe more than 10 beers can be worse than this stuff every sub-street bum must hate putting in his mouth, but does it anyway.

Lucky Lager Force 10;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);(1.183L Bottle) I bought this because needed something to rinse the pipes after the drano. Terrible stuff... the smell still haunts me.
Lucky Lager Force 10;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Corn and alcohol invade the nasal passage, golden, with a medium white head. Strong alcohol assaults the tongue, harsh in the mouth. Not the least bit pleasant.
McGregor;Melle, Belgium;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brouwerij Huyghe;"One of Huyghe’s strange hit-or-miss experiments, since 1993 but not sure if it’s still made; a ’whisky beer’, in the sense that it is made with whisky malts, resulting in a whisky-like orange blonde colour (with thin head) and a whisky-like smell paired with orange, vanilla and dried fruits, sweet profile, bit strange, unbalanced and artificial. I had worse from this brewery but then, my palate wasn’t by far as experienced as it is now when I tasted it (which was in 2002 at Trollekelder in Ghent). Not sure why it is listed as a smoked beer here..."
McGregor;Melle, Belgium;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brouwerij Huyghe;250mL bottle poured golden with white head and little lacing. Slight aroma of whisky and smoke. Tastes of caramel malt and earthy hops. Moderate carbonation and medium body. Quite a unique beer.
McGregor;Melle, Belgium;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brouwerij Huyghe;Nice amber color, a lot of chunky sediment and a weak head. The aroma is very malty, rather like the mesh, and the flavour is sweet, malty with notes of apricot, plum and citrus. I get no notes of smoke and I find it cloying in the long run.
McGregor;Melle, Belgium;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brouwerij Huyghe;"Bottle. Nice looking amber colour with a slim off-white head. Aroma of sweet malt and whiskey. Flavours are very sweet, vanilla, malts and light butterscotch. Medium bodied with a light finish. I have a sweet tooth; I quite like this."
McGregor;Melle, Belgium;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brouwerij Huyghe;Bottle 25 cl. Creamy white mostly lasting head. Fantastic orange colour. Powerfull malty and yeasty aroma. Lots of flavor, but there is something ih the finish that I dont like.
McGregor;Melle, Belgium;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brouwerij Huyghe;(Bottle 25 cl) Pretty much everything is unusual about this beer: the Scottish name, the small, clear glass bottle and the smoked malts. Incredibly pretty (whisky)golden colour with a small, white head. Medium body, smooth malty character with an oddly dry character. Unusual palate when this hits the buds. oaky, smoked notes. 100399
McGregor;Melle, Belgium;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brouwerij Huyghe;Just short of downright offensive, but pretty poor stuff. This certainly isn’t Bamberg style smoked, just uses lightly smoked whisky malt. It’s very creamy with lots of vanilla and a soft mouthfeel, to the point of flabbiness. Has a rather artificial feel to it. Drinkable, but desperately short of interest. No discernible hop presence whatsoever. Goes out with a whimper. Very peculiar. 250 ml bottle at the Joet London gathering, January 2005.
McGregor;Melle, Belgium;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brouwerij Huyghe;Insanely sweet vanilla caramel aroma. Flavour is too sweet and cloying. Some oaky smokey notes, but mostly just sickly toffee. Not my type of beer.
McGregor;Melle, Belgium;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brouwerij Huyghe;Bottle. Sweet coconut and vanilla in the aroma. Sweet whiskey malt on the palate, and a little sticky, some caramel and toffee and some slight peaty flavours, just way too sweet and sticky.
McGregor;Melle, Belgium;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brouwerij Huyghe;Bottle at Chris’ house. Amber. Vanilla aroma. Flavour is sweet, of vanilla and some butterskotch. I didn’t detect any smoke, nor did I think this was bad.
Uttendorf Weissbier Dunkel;Uttendorf, Austria;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Privatbrauerei Vitzthum;Tiefdunkle Farbe. Malzig, leicht röstig, süße und säuerliche Noten. Anders als die sehr intensive Farbe vermuten lässt, ist dies keine Geschmacksbombe und hat nicht wirklich viel Substanz. Dadurch aber schön süffig. Wäre noch süffiger mit etwas weniger Kohlensäure.

St Ghislain Brune Villers Spéciale;Silly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie de Silly;Brown 25cl bottle, best before 22 Aug 2007, drank 10 July 2007. Obtained while travelling through Belgium. Poured into one of my Corsendonk tulip glasses. Dirty, murky red-come-dark brown in colour with a scummy biege thin head. Aroma of sweet molasses, a kind of toffee, malty smell. The taste follows the aroma at first, sweet and malty. Then sour fruit flavours arrive as the beer warmed. The alcohol comes through in the mouthfeel, not the greatest beer to come from Silly, but not all bad. I will not be searching high and low for this beer, but if our paths cross again, I won’t run away.
St Ghislain Brune Villers Spéciale;Silly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie de Silly;Pours golden amber with no head. Sweet, malty aroma - unidimensional but pleasant. One of the smoothest beers I’ve had if not the most complex - very well done Belgian ale.

St Ghislain Brune Villers Spéciale;Silly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie de Silly;Bouteille 25cl. Cuivre, col beige. Belle petite surprise, bière maltée, caramel avec pas mal de fruits noirs. Je pense que la base d’origine pour cette recette doit être la scotch de Silly. Profile est épais et malté, pas de bons fruits noirs et une touche de réglisse. Alcool est réchauffant, malt confère un profile grillé, toffee, sucre brun avec sur la fin une pointe d’amertume. Earlier Rating: 7/9/2011 Total Score: 3.6 bouteille 25cl. Couleur cuivre, col beige. Arôme fruité sec, allant vers la date, figue, caramel et malt le tout restant bien présent et avec une bonne note de sucre candi. En bouche, je retrouve là le même caractère que au nez. Une bière qui est forte agréable et mélange parfaitement le caramel, le malt, sucre candi/brun avec la mélasse, fruits confits sucrés le tout terminant sur une très fine amertume mais qui conserve néanmoins une bonne présence fruitée. Possible que tout cela se soit rendu plus présent par l’age, mais une bière qui m’a convaincu.
St Ghislain Brune Villers Spéciale;Silly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie de Silly;Bottle @ Delirium, Brussels. Pours deep redish chestnut with a small, creamy, white head.

Flavour has pleasant fat maltiness, rather warming and vinious, plums, light chocolate, molasses and good port. Long dry and kinda oaky finish. Nice.
St Ghislain Brune Villers Spéciale;Silly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie de Silly;Bottle. Sweet prune and brown sugar malt aroma. Cloudy orange-brown color with large tan head.

Hale's Lunar Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Hale's Ales;Black as expected, this beer had a nice alcohol underlacing and definite smokiness with some resemblance, though not unpleasant, to a burnt tire. Drinking this beer conjured up the image of a camping lodge after a day spent ice fishing--and I see that Andrew196 had a similar result. This beer is certainly ripe for such an occasion--a crafty porter from the pacific northwest.

GLASSWARE: Man Skirt willibecker... another gift from Tom, courtesy of his annual beer fest.... this one pours a hearty orange-brown body, proudly displaying effervescence throughout the glass and culminating in a frothy, foamy half-finger white head--looks the part... cracker, caramel and violet at the forefront here... very sweet suggestions, a bit of phenol as well, which disparages the aroma a bit... oily, thick, and medicinal on the tongue... warming--and I usually don't buy beer that doesn't warn me of its ABV on the label--and at 5.7, this should be more agreeable...I could see this wearing down an afternoon that otherwise calls for a Fest... its flavor profile is indeed syrupy sweet (which seems to be what an American overdo lately), corny almost, with a reasonable cracker and caramel malt base that seems to win a little back from the overall lackluster experience.... definitely had better Lakefront products, but this is at best near the middle of the laundry list of marzens available...

Lakefront Oktoberfest;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lakefront Brewery;Rated on 10-01-2017. (Bottle - Best By 28 DEC 2017) The appearance is a medium sized frothy creamy head that mostly diminished, copper transparent body, lively, fast rising carbonation, and one ring of lacing. The aroma is fruity, malt, bready, light citrus hops, some toffee, and caramel. The flavor presents very light bitterness, some toffee, malt, caramel, bready, some fruitiness, and lightly sweet. The mouthfeel is light carbonation and clean. This beer is light bodied. This beer is very easy drinking, but does not uphold to its style. It also has a light malt finish and aftertaste that is not offensive. This beer is not one of the better ones for this style that I have drank/rated.

Siletz Paddle Me IPA;Siletz, Oregon, United States;IPA;Siletz Brewing and Public House;This beer obviously has a multiple personality disorder. Half of the people think it is normal, and the other think it’s a drain pour. I opened this bottle to a gusher, despite leaving it still and chilled for a week. When I poured the beer, it filled the tall pint glass with foam. Like 100% foam. Like, you can lift up the glass and look at the bottom and only see foam. After five minutes, an inch of cloudy, auburn beer has appeared, and the head has dropped an inch below the rim. The bottle sits in the sink and continues to foam out. Malty, yeasty, hoppy, stale aroma. I fear I got one of the bad batches. Flat, stale, bad. This beer, was hardly worth the wait. They should put warning labels on this beer. I hate to pour out a bomber of IPA, but this must be done. :-(

Siletz Paddle Me IPA;Siletz, Oregon, United States;IPA;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Wierd fruity, hoppy aroma. Very sweet, lemony tart malt backbone - very fruity, with almost a berry essence, with a big soapy component which kind of gives you the impression of Pine-Sol. Not sure what they are trying to do with drink but I suggest taking it back to the drawing board.

Amsterdam Explorator;Boekelo, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Strong;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);J'ai du tester au lycée, c'est sans doute bien pour se défoncer le cerveau sans comprendre ce qui nous arrive. La bière de clodo en somme.
Amsterdam Explorator;Boekelo, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Strong;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);The foam is very sporadic at this canned version of a Dutch beer. It has been purchased and brought home from France to me and I received it as a gift from a person who knows I like beers. The flavor is sweet and slightly floral. Furthermore, it is only very lightly hopped. I find it very synthetic sweet. Some canned beer can taste metallic and in this case I would rather have had the metallic taste with a little hopelessly malt and hop flavor. This artificially sweet drink is too similar to a bad energy drink mixed with equally bad beer. However, it can be drunk, but is totally away from any enjoyment
Amsterdam Explorator;Boekelo, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Strong;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);50cl can. Clear pale golden colour with white head. Malts in the aroma. Average carbonation and light watery body. Overall, drinkable.

A: Clear pale yellow color with a small white head which dissipates quickly leaving some lacings S: Smells caramel malt and honey with an alcoholic end T: Strong malt taste. (Too) Sweet beginning and quite bitter end. Alcohol can also be felt M: Medium to full body. Low carbonation. Balanced sweet-bitterness. Molasses sensation D: Heavy beer. Not big deal... [ BA Review @ 4/20/2010 ]
Amsterdam Explorator;Boekelo, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Strong;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Clear pale orange body with minimal white head on top. Nose has notes of malts and honey. Taste is overly sweet and malty. Carbonation is medium with lots of small soft bubbles. Taste is nothing special, easy to drink and plenty of alcohol.
Amsterdam Explorator;Boekelo, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Strong;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Tall can from a Kiwi Mart, Phnom Penh. Pours golden, a bit of head. Nose of sweet malt and glue. Flavour is like corn syrup with viscosity to match, no fusel alcohols so I guess it’s not that bad. Lasting sweet finish. One’s enough. Basically a smooth malt liquor.
Amsterdam Explorator;Boekelo, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Strong;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Very pale, golden body with quickly diminishing head. Looks like piss. Light malty, not as sweet as I expected. No hops whatsoever. Light bitter taste, very unimaginative bit agreeably not so bad. Drinks very easy, just very low quality malts and no character at all. So actually better than expected but a not a recommendation. (50cl can from Carrefour in Tours)
Amsterdam Explorator;Boekelo, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Strong;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);500 ml @ vPBF 2012. Pours a clear yellow colour with a small head. Aroma of grainy malts, overly ripe fruits and some butter. Flavour of sweet grainy malts, citrus, grassy hops and some butter. Medium bodied, slick mouthfeel and low carbonation. Alcohol comes through in the finish with some moderate maltiness. Not very good.
Amsterdam Explorator;Boekelo, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Strong;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);50 cl can @ vPBF, BBE 23.02.2013. Thanks Pat! Aroma is stale with some hay, grainy malt and hints of metal. Flavour has some solvent‐like alcohol, some grainy malt, corn and hints of honey. Dry feeling at the end. Bad.

Sternburg Export;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);(500ml bottle, 0.39 EUR, Berlin) AROMA: soft nose of bread dough, hint of hay and grain, not very hoppy APPEARANCE: medium stray yellow, head can be forced to a finger or two but quickly dies to minimal residue, clear TASTE: tad sweet but with a little bit of the euro lager/pils malt/hops. easy grain, touch spice, straight to the point ... a light tasting german lager PALATE: light, some fizz then soft creamy and smooth, easy finish OVERALL: i could see this as an intro beer to euro style lageer/pils for those who have only had american mass lagers. more flavor and body than the lesser lagers but not too big of a jump into the real-beer pool. a light, yet enjoyable, beer.
Sternburg Export;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Direkt ur flaska på Köpi, Berlin. Ljust gyllengul med vitt skum (ett andra dricka ur glas). Doft och smak av säd, hö, maltsötma och lättare gräsiga- och metalliska toner.

Sternburg Export;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Für ein Export recht würzig ohne bitter zu sein. Kräftig im Geschmack, keineswegs wässrig oder flau. Sehr ausgewogen im Geschmack.
Sternburg Export;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Konnte das Sterni Pils noch den Durchschittstrinker mit doch netten Aromen erfreuen, so ist das Export schon ein richtiges Vernichtungsbier, also ein Bier das man vernichtet, um sich zu vernichten. Es hat einen vollen Körper ohne Fehlaromen, aber auch ohne geschmackliche Freuden.
Sternburg Export;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);I'm from London and I love this beer. Probably one of my favourite. Not sure if because I was on holiday in Berlin when had it but ticks every box.
Sternburg Export;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Color amarillo, cristalina. Tres dedos de espuma con buena retención.

Sternburg Export;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sternburg-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);500ml bottle: BBE Mar 19. Poured into an old Schultheiss half-litre sleeve at home on 19th Aug 18. Very pale golden body, clean and clear, the head a white wispy affair. Grainy nose and taste, hops content giving a slight bitter and dryness, some metallic traces within the flavour, struggled to finish the bottle.

Ostravar Premium (12° Svetlé);Ostrava, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Ostravar (Staropramen - Molson Coors);Malt, herbs, some cardboard, crisp, medium carbonation. Not bad Czech pilsener. Another one.
Ostravar Premium (12° Svetlé);Ostrava, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Ostravar (Staropramen - Molson Coors);Thanks Motelpogo! :D Clear darker golden body, white head. Fruity, sweetish aroma mixing with herbal hoppiness. Generic but a'ight. Sweetish malty taste with a herbal hoppy touch. As simple as that, very little else, nothing much in the finish. Average, slightly unappealing finish, but generally clean and distinctly average, if on the slightly hoppier side of average.

Ostravar Premium (12° Svetlé);Ostrava, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Ostravar (Staropramen - Molson Coors);Bottle. I don't understand this beer's low score. Yes, it's a macropils and yet the only actually very good corporate rendition of a Bohemian Pils, apart from Urquell. Medium body, bready notes complimented by a light buttery hint and then come the hops - herbal, slightly tobacco-like and quite bitter. I can really find no fault in this.
Vranik Tmavé 10°;Ostrava, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovar Ostravar (Staropramen - Molson Coors);there's some nice coal-roasted almonds in there but not enough body.........

Koník Světlé 10°;Ostrava, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Ostravar (Staropramen - Molson Coors);Not bad beer for a national brewer! Quite bitter and hoppy with a balanced maltiness, very drinkable. (Bottle from Kiosk, Ostrava Svinov) - but I think you'd need a lot to make Ostrava look good, unless you like chemical factories, that is.

Classic beer label with a lot of gold medals and a signature in red by a Brewmaster. Pours clear yellow with a medium-sized white head. Settles as 0,5 cm thick layer of foam just covering the surface of the beer. Substantial Lacing. Aroma is sweetish, fruity and with some prominent sour, sharp notes. Sweet pale malts, grains. Fresh grass. Slightly skunky. Sharp, sour citrus. Light carbonation. Thin, oily, lightly tingling texture. Flavor is medium sweet followed by a medium strong bitterness. Aftertaste is bitter. Lingers for bit. Not fantastic - but it has a decent bitterness. ButI could do without the skunk.

Ich habe mir einmal die Zeit genommen das Bier näher zu betrachten (man bekommt es auch in normalen 0,5 l-Pfandflaschen). ""Nüchtern"" betrachtet hat man es hier mit einem Massenbier ohne besondern Geschmack, außer einem ekeligen Gefühl im Mund nachher.

The flavor contains molasses and caramelized malts with a dry finish and a dark chocolate taste that lingers. The only real downside to this beer is that it is thin, although it is still soft and smooth on the palate. Additional body would do wonders for taking this from being a good beer to one that is REALLY good! Draught sample at the Winthrop Brewing Company in Winthrop, Washington. Rating #5 for this beer...

Harveys Old Ale (Bottle);Lewes, East Sussex, England;Old Ale;Harveys Brewery;Bottle from brewery. Now I have rated this beer a few times before under the title XXX old ale, but I am reviweing here for the bottle properly because the cask version is quite different. This is a lower abv, much more watery and ultimately, less flavourful (and good). That said, the old ale even in the bottle is a delight to drink with some caramel, molasses, fireplace smell shining through the wateriness. The thinness is actually also something that makes it so gluggable and nice to have a beer with so much taste with such a low ABV (it is a step up from the nice alcohol free beer, Bill Brewer).

Feint sweet malty aroma. Slightly watery and oily mouthfeel but flavour is balanced really well.

Harveys Bonfire Boy (Cask);Lewes, East Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;Harveys Brewery;Dec 2018 - Cask handpull at the Royal Oak, Borough. As Harveys Bonfire Boy, 5.8%. Dispensed and presented in a suitably surly manner by a barman drinking his own pint at the same time. Dark brown with an amber hue, still with a foamy beige or light brown head which leaves thick and full lacing. Aroma is teacake, apricots and old carpet up front, yielding to toffee apple over time. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is full of rounded malt, yeast and spiced flavours. Spiced teacake and Jamaica Ginger Cake. Chewy full malts counterbalanced by a pleasant astringency, leaving a crystalised ginger and hot crossed bun linger. Huge malts without getting too sweet. Taste is so full and characterful. More enjoyable the more you drink. Lots of flavour for the abv. Very good indeed. It's rare for me to order the 'same again' these days, but I ordered a pint of this after being impressed by a half. I could, and would happily, put away a few pints of this in relaxed company of an eve. (7-4-9-4-16=4.0)

Lake Superior Sandstone Pale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;More adventures of Adam and Tim. Rode our snowmobiles all of the way from the Houghton area to here. This is where Tim had the novel idea of wanting to grow a beard. I said, sure go for it dude. Luckily, having this beer several times in both of our lives after he started growing his beard, his Irish heritage kicked in and well, yes, his beard was the color of this beard, pale orange/red. Tim kept his beard over the years. I saw a picture of him just last week and there’s some light strings of white, reminded me of the light lace that I saw in this beer. With a good balance between malt and hops in this beer, Tim himself became a good man later in life balancing his activities of snow mobiling, hunting, fishing, and beer drinking. Always keeping life’s priorities together.
Lake Superior Sandstone Pale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;tap at the brewpub - This brew has a citrus hop and mild malt aroma with a trace of caramel. The flavor is of mild to moderately bitter hops with a good balancing malt sweetness. It’s medium bodied and easy to drink with good lingering bitterness. It was definitely the best of the five beers they had on when I visited the brewpub.
Lake Superior Sandstone Pale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Drank from a growler fresh filled that day at the brewpub. I had planned on bringing this back to Minneapolis, but an afternoon spent in a canoe led my wife and I to drink the entire growler in one sitting. This is the perfect example of how one’s mood and atmosphere can influence how you perceive a beer. The beer wasn’t mind-blowing by any stretch, but sitting in our campsite on a warm July afternoon it couldn’t have been more perfect. A glowing gold/orange pour topped by a resilient bright white head. Aroma consisted of lightly fruity hops balanced by a nice herbal/grassy character. Dry bread crust malt profile. Flavor pretty much followed suit. Fairly dry on the tongue, and quite drinkable. No real flaws at all... just a well made pale ale that absolutely hit the spot that afternoon.
Lake Superior Sandstone Pale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Spent a good part of this past week stumbling around Grand Marais, Michigan, and of course hit the brew pub a couple of times. First night in I ordered a pint of the Sandstone Pale Ale, planning to work my way through the rest of the offerings – or at least a few of them. Several pints later I was still on the Sandstone – when you hook up with something this good it is hard to quit… Medium yellowish amber / cloudy pour in a pub style pint glass. (Might have been only 12 oz, not sure.) One finger of decent head that persisted for some time. Excellent aroma dominated with crisp hoppy goodness. Best word to describe this ale is “crisp” - subdued but discernable maltiness hits the tongue with a rich and complex hoppy finish dominated by aromatic and citrus hops. It is light in palate but lively carbonation gives it an excellent mouthfeel. No cloying, no sweet, just a solid malt backbone with a fantastic hops blend riding along on it. This is a truly world class pale ale.
Lake Superior Sandstone Pale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Aroma of sweet citrus hops-orange and lemon, along with an inviting pine scent that fits in with the surrounding environment. Full-flavored APA, but smooth enough to want to drink a growler or too.
Lake Superior Sandstone Pale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;On tap at the brewpub. Deeply clouded artificial orange soda pop apperance. Rim of greasy white. Blast of raw, unbridled Cascade glands. A heavy dose of West Coast destruction. More florally orange, then piney. Flavor is a rich sweet fruity full blast of tingle Amarillo/Cascade sweetness. Grapefruit and candied apples. A very raw and forward hop presentation. Pleasant. Palate is a tingle bite, with full long grassy draws. A quite drinkable version.
Lake Superior Sandstone Pale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;On tap at the brewpub/bar. Hazy orange body, medium off-white head. Vibrant nose of citrusy hops, including grapefruit and orange aromas, backed by a sweet maltiness. Bright hops flavors, crisp and fresh, with a strong citrus presence. Malts are subdued, bready and caramely. Bitter finish. A nice APA.
Lake Superior Sandstone Pale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;On tap in Grand Marais at the Saloon. Wow! I’ve been by it a hundred times and not tried it, because I was chasing brook trout(brookies). Great dry hops taste, in the middle with a fruitiness and the ending with the dry hoppy bitterness. Had a good medium head on it to..well the way I poured it. Really good pale ale. Good aroma to, piney, simi-citrusy. I took some home from the saloon....well worth it!
Lake Superior Sandstone Pale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Color is a very hazy deep yellow with a small thin white head of super tight foam leaving super tiny dots of lace with some webbyness closer to the bottom. Smell is a nice light citrusy/piney hop, very fresh and clean. Taste is more of the same with a pretty steady amount of hops, citrusy light and a bit astringent, but still pretty easy and smooth, has a good bite and bitterness. Feel is medium bodied and a bit gritty/grainy, bitterness sticks a bit in the end.

Lake Superior Hematite Stout;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;More Tim and Adam adventures. We were supposed to be practicing for the pond hockey tournament in St. Ignace. Once again, we found ourselves in Grand Marais. Some guys said that they were going to put a team together for the tournament and found some ice time in Munising, which wasn’t too far away. Well, we get to the rink and well, lo and behold Tim forgot his shin pads. Really, dude? Always gotta have your shin pads for hockey even if it is just pond hockey. The good thing about hematite is that it is a stone that is supposed to absorb negative energy and calms during times of stress. And so this beer was drank after practice that day, cause Tim borrowed someone else’s. Decent beer, to be honest.
Lake Superior Hematite Stout;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;On tap at brewery ..on our snowmobiles on our michigan trip... pitch black pour with no head...toasty nuts and coffe aroma...some mocha taste..good overall
Lake Superior Hematite Stout;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Draft Brewery 8/16/04-Pours dark brown almost black with a small head. Aroma of chocolate and roasted malt. Taste of the same but a bit thin for a stout. This medium bodied brew was not bad in flavor but just a bit thin.
Lake Superior Hematite Stout;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;tap at the brewpub - Pours dark brown with a lingering light tan head. The aroma is primarily of chocolate malt with some notes of maple and caramel. While it smells good, unfortunately the flavor is weak and watery with a thin body. It’s certainly drinkable, but it’s a letdown after the enjoyable aroma.
Lake Superior Hematite Stout;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Deep brown-black pour with a rim of tan. Distant roasted beast and coffee aroma. A thin jaunt of coffee roast, beef crust and light molasses. Some restrained sweetness balances with the dry roasted character. Caramelized. Some leaching sweetness stays the bitter roasted character, but it still smacks peculiarly. A mediocre stout without any particularly intriguing character. I’m beginning to think that based on current and past ratings that the quality of the brewing at this place has fallen drastically in the past few years. These beers weren’t flavorful or too thin, but they were a little dirty and the whole line up is hit or miss.
Lake Superior Hematite Stout;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;thought this tasted a little like band aides....oily, more of a sweet stout...roasty at the end...mouth feel off a bit
Lake Superior Hematite Stout;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;On tap at the brewpub/bar. Dark brown body, thin to medium off-white head. Nice, sweet chocolatey aroma with appropriate roastiness. Smooth, rather thin body, but velvety, with milk chocolate, roasted malts, and touches of sweet fruits. Quaffable and refreshing for a stout.
Lake Superior Hematite Stout;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Thin liquidy black color with light lacing of off-white ivory color, very thin head was produced, dissolving like a puff a smoke in the wind. Smell is roasted malts, dark and earthy a bit, hard to get in the nose anything really. Taste makes up for it, nice drying stout taste the way it should be. Darkly roasted malts mostly with a touch of nut and nutskins and a nice little hop twinge late. Fresh and soild. Pretty full bodied and slightly rich, smooth and nice drying quality thats really easy going. Very nice stout, quite satisfying and enjoyable.
Lake Superior Hematite Stout;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Stout;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Appropriate for a UP brew to be named for an iron bearing mineral, but I'd expect to see some reddish highlights given the name and this thing is as black as stouts come. Still, it does have a metallic tang to accompany its roasted complexities and while i find this bonus to be a bit unpleasant, it does lend more credence to the name.

Amber, almost gelatinous-looking with a raft of tiny dark suspended particles and an average white fizzy sticky head, even some lacing.

Canoe Dark Ale (formerly Beaver Brown Ale);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Canoe Brewpub;August 17th, 2012 - If memory serves me right, this was a draft from a local tap house, and one close to the water. The landscape was gorgeous, and not unlike a scene from Battlestar Galactica, combining a slow flowing waterway with the modern minimalism of concrete architecture and delicately repurposed buildings, saved from decay and violence-by-wrecking ball. And the beer to give this scene a little flair was Canoe Brewpub’s Dark Ale. A fresh puff of aroma hits the nose from the beer, and a quick sip as I take in the interior of the bar hits me with a sudsy and chalky touch of hot chocolate, with a long baker’s chocolate aftertaste. The balance between the dark cocoa sugars and the hops is well done, making this a nice, satisfying drink to take in after a long day of walking around Victoria.
Canoe Dark Ale (formerly Beaver Brown Ale);Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Canoe Brewpub;On draught at the brewpub. Translucent Very Dark Brown, beige head. Nose is coffee, earthy.

Lake Superior Log Slide Lager;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Draft Brewery 8/16/04-Pours golden with a decent size head. Aroma of hops, grains, and slight malt. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew goes down easy.
Lake Superior Log Slide Lager;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Well, first let me say that this brewery must be among the top ten most scenic in the world, located in Grand Marais on the shores of Lake Superior. Only the drive to Grand Teton Brewing rivals it in my experience. The location IS significant, because I have the feeling that even the basest macroswill would go down smooth in lovely in these environs. Anyway, this particular brew is beautiful in its own right, an astonishing, controlled power of Saaz working through a robust, buttery malt. It looks great, too, a lovely golden sunset color with grand head retention, even from a growler a day from its initial pour. I've had so many lackluster brewpub brews recently that finding this very fine one was a joy of joys.

Heavyweight Biere d´Art;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Heavyweight Brewing Company;750mL courtesy of MrChopin. Pours a muddy brune with a light tan head. Good retention and lace. Aroma is cream of wheat, little diacetyl, licorice, citrus fruits. Taste is spritzy, light citrus, moving to malty, buttery (not offensive diacetyl), licorice. I think this bottle has been very well kept because it is developing little off-character. Still not great.

Bluegrass Monks Pale Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Gold, nose has melon and berry, is sugary and light. Palate is simply spectacular on this one, gloriously soft and inviting, just rolls luxuriously around the mouth. A stunning mouthfeel. Flavor also good, some sugars are there with a bit of yeast, some lemon and mild fruit.

Taste is sweet, candy sugar, orange, coriander. Medium with below-average carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden.
Bluegrass Monks Pale Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;BBC beer, local brewpub here in Louisville, all I can say is that they need to try harder. Oldenberg brewer was better when they were open.Not may favorite they will have to do better to get my business, even though they do have a loyal local following, better than macro brews , but not as good as most.
Bluegrass Monks Pale Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;I new when the waitress brought to me the shameful looking, bodyless liquid this was gonna be unexciting. Served in a tall (sample) shot glass of all things. The aroma was decent with pale malt, spice, hint of caramel. Watery palate and overly dry. Flavors of grape skin and mineral water. A most one dimensional brew. This brewery consistently dishes out lackluster versions of, what could be, intriguing styles.
Lake Superior Rolling Wheat;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;As a lover of hugely citrusy wheats, this one failed to get my attention. It's also a little weak bodied. But it does have some feisty spice action, so it's not altogether a lost cause.
Lake Superior Rolling Wheat;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;My second growler of good Grand Marais stuff in as many nights, this wheat brew is gentle in almost everything: mild citrus, mild esters, medium to light body, gentle cloudy appearance with a great creamy head. But over all of this gentility rocks the big spicy, peppery close, something I admire, hence I like this beer. It's kind of like the Germans and the Belgians meet in football and the Belgian side provides the crusher at the end.
Bitter End Imperial Pale;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Golden color with a sweet floral, but mildly hoppy aroma. Soft caramel flavor which turns to a bitter hoppy finish. A decent IPA, but could use a little more balance.
Bitter End Imperial Pale;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;When freshly served and still cold, the hops are covered by a malty sweetness. The lower in the glass you go, the more hops you taste. Success.
Bitter End Imperial Pale;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Interesting beer...just as hoppy as the Armstrong, but has a nice sweet maltiness to mask it. The hops really came out as it warmed though....good beer!
Bitter End Imperial Pale;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Yes folks, ""Imperial Pale"". Perhaps they're going to make an India Stout next. This brewpub is getting bold with their seasonals, and this one is no exception. After drinking 5 beers, two of them an Arrogant Bastard and a La Trappe Dubbel, I could still enjoy the strong taste of this stuff despite my obliterated palate! Very floral and hoppy, reminiscient of US West-Coast IPAs. I can't really remember details of the flavor because I was so hammered, but I'll surely have it again in the next few weeks and update the rating."

Aber die vielsprachigen Aufdrucke (sogar auf Chinesisch) zeigen, dass das Bier viel exportiert wird.

Big Horn Maple Honey Brown;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Draught. Body is medium brown. Aroma is strong pancake syrup (wouldn't go so far as to say pure maple, more like Log Cabin or Aunt Jemima). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Aroma is, to my nose, entirely syrup...there's no resemblance to beer at all, hence the low-ball score there. And oddly enough, the flavor isn't syrupy sweet...it's actually pretty ordinarily sweet, but without a whole lot to balance. So although it's like sniffing pancake syrup, it's thankfully not quite like drinking it (I was envisioning the diner scene from Super Troopers). Don't get me wrong, maple hints in the nose would be pleasant, but there's really nothing else there.
Big Horn Barley Wine;Lakewood, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);(Westminster, CO, C.B. & Potts) Old Bacchus Barleywine: Huge, sugary nose. Rich, candy-like flavor. Reminded me of that conical, multi-colored (striped) sucker that I can''t remember the name of. Red ale undertones. Very rich and very sugary. I couldn''t taste the alcohol much at the top, but it was VERY evident toward the last sip. Hops show little presence.
Big Horn Barley Wine;Lakewood, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Dark colored, but with a reddish hue. This beer gives off and candy malt aroma and and a similar flavor. A fairly well balanced barley wine with a relatively moderate alcohol content for the style it seems.
Swan Stout;Canning Vale, Australia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Swan Brewery (Lion Nathan Co.);(375 ml any bottle shop in Perth, WA) Unerrated stout. Seriously good drop for the dollar, apparently brewed in South Australia. Rich sweet, roasty flavours, well worth the small funds needed to sample.
Swan Stout;Canning Vale, Australia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Swan Brewery (Lion Nathan Co.);"is this in fact southwark stout??? bottle says something about ""brewed in breweries in the swan group"" or something. anyway. similar to southwark this is a smooth, lagery, chocolatey sort of stout, sweet and round and coffeeish but not very complex. some marmaladiness. not much bitterness. OK. would improve with oysters i reckon."
Swan Stout;Canning Vale, Australia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Swan Brewery (Lion Nathan Co.);Dark brown with a sandy-soil head that didn’t last too long. Roasted malt and bready yeast aromas, but not much else. Thin palate, all roast malt and little else to describe. Maybe I drank it too cold???
Swan Stout;Canning Vale, Australia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Swan Brewery (Lion Nathan Co.);A lot of hesitation behind this one. I am sure that this was one of the original Australian stouts, brewed as ’Kalgoorlie’ or ’Hannan’s Stout around 100 years ago and seemingly similar to the Southwark offering (I love corporate Australia!). In the new century, big business obviously wheeled it’s ugly head, and seemed to have left this untouched. To early notes about Australian Stouts, this seemed to not faulter. Marmite, molasses and burnt sugars, and a decent waft of yeast dominated the aroma, and was, honestly, a little off putting!. Inside, it delivered rich dark chocolate up front, a creamy full bodied palate, with dry roasted grain in the long swallow and no sense of the alcohol. Molasses cane flavour seemed complimentary to the toasted and dry bitter malt, roasted grain and mocha flavours of this balanced and simple stout. Overall, I was surprised by this one. A good, honest Foreign Extra Stout. Understated!!!
Swan Stout;Canning Vale, Australia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Swan Brewery (Lion Nathan Co.);Surprisingly a bit like Southwark with the identical ABV. Not as good though I’m sorry to say, but there is a good character of burnt chocolate and heavy malts. There is a slight imbalance that it’s SA cousin doesn’t possess.

Swan Stout;Canning Vale, Australia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Swan Brewery (Lion Nathan Co.);Sampled AIBA 2004: Standard dark brown with good head. Flavour is almost completely burned malt with some alcohol in the finish.
Swan Stout;Canning Vale, Australia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Swan Brewery (Lion Nathan Co.);This eastern states brewed WA beer came out with a very pillowy light brown head which was long lasting and with good lacing.

Swan Stout;Canning Vale, Australia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Swan Brewery (Lion Nathan Co.);Opaque brown with a very large creamy texture rocky island lasting dark brown head. Light dark roasted grain and malt bitter aroma. Medium thin body, lacks the smoothess normally associated with a good stout. The flavour includes a chemical paint thinner something and medium bitter roast malt flavours. Weaker bitter sweet finish and soft sweetish asftertaste. Lacks balance and blending.

Rock Bottom Indianapolis Sugar Creek Pale;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Indianapolis;Identifiable at the festival only by its tap handle label and the brewer’s word, this Pale Ale had a light amber body with a huge white head. It had a quiet pale malty sweetness in the nose complemented by hop scents of oranges, tangerines, and a mild touch of pine. That pretty much describes the flavor, too.

Anywho, interesting muddy unfiltered brackish color where the taste and mouthfeel is quite pleasing and where apperance belies a good strike.

Jordan Ales Publicans Choice;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Very smooth and clean tasting. Rich dark umber brown, just about the darkest brown ale I've ever seen. Cool.
Jordan Ales Publicans Choice;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;my favorite of nut brown ales. really smooth and hoppy. great beer to have with a steak.
Jordan Ales Publicans Choice;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Hmmm...Very nutty. I''m not sure what to say because this beer is apparently unavailable to most parts of the world. Smooth finish, highly carbonated. Nice looking, dark red ale with good head retention.
Jordan Ales Publicans Choice;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Dubuque, IA? Mine states that it is brewed in Syracuse, NY. Anyway, I've been curious about this been ever since a large stack of it mysteriously appeared at my beer distributor one day, and quickly started vanishing week after week. This beer has a very complex, rich, nutty flavor, but the alcohol content is obviously high enough to still be noticable through all that richness. Even so, a great beer. [PS: Beware! I had one bottle in my six pack blow up on me like a science fair volcano. I had yummy brown ale all over my kitchen counter instead of in my stomach where it was supposed to be.] [PPS: Since this is VERY craft brewed, quality varies greatly from batch to batch. The second six pack I bought wasn't nearly as good as the first.]
Jordan Ales Publicans Choice;Syracuse, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;A very impressive, nutty brew from this unknown, rookie brewery. It’s contract brewed out of Syracuse, NY, by Middle Ages Brewing (it used to be brewed in Dubuque), but I was pleasantly surprised with its complexity and significant ’nut factor’. You can’t go wrong with this quality offering.

Grizzly Peak Mild;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Grizzly Peak Brewing Co.;A reddish ale that was a big surprise for me as well. This lightly hopped, low alcohol brew would make an excellent session ale. (especially if you could drink it from the cask!!) The malts were sweet, but not sticky and was just a bit thin.
Grizzly Peak Mild;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Grizzly Peak Brewing Co.;Tap cask conditioned. I had low expectations for this beer, but it turned out to be one of the best ones of the night. A beige head with some red fruits and pear flavor.

Grizzly Peak El Hefe;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Grizzly Peak Brewing Co.;tap at the brewpub - Wow, I’m so glad my sample from the brewpub wasn’t eggy and poopy like an unfortunate rater below. Pours very hazy straw colored with a dense, lasting head. The aroma is of citrus and clove. It has a sweet, summery flavor with banana, citrus and perhaps a touch of floral character. I actually liked this one. Maybe they’ve improved it.
Grizzly Peak El Hefe;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Grizzly Peak Brewing Co.;Definite clove. Not a ton of banana. Pretty fiddling for a hefeweizen. Not the best beer on the sampler.
Grizzly Peak El Hefe;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Grizzly Peak Brewing Co.;On tap at the brew pub as part of a sampler...Pours a cloudy light yellow, with a light white head...the aroma is super strong, a total clove bomb, way to much clove not enough of anything else.

Grizzly Peak El Hefe;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Grizzly Peak Brewing Co.;Draft… RBSG 2010… Murky yellow ale with a small, creamy, white head. Excellent retention.

Pours a well-hazed, sandy/golden/amber with a holding white head leaving sheets of lace. Way too much sulfur off the top when poured (next day) from growler to pint. Eggy. Poopy. Smelling salts. Lambic-like. Holding my breath, I can find moderate bananas above manure notes. Sour citrics. Rather thin. White grape. Very difficult to finish the growler once my wife gave up on it.

Ushers Summer Madness;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cask@The triple Crown, Richmond. This pub normally does a good pint, so i don’t think it had anything to do with condition, i just thought this was an bog standard, crap beer. Very thin, and i’d hardly call it a German Hefe!!!! This was a thin blond ale, with slight sour malts, very thin and extremely bpring, some lemon tang, but not much else.
Ushers Summer Madness;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Hand pulled at the Goat and Tricycle, Bournemouth. Purporting to be brewed with wheat, and flavoured with fruit and honey. Honey coloured actually, and smelling like a bramble bush. Fruity and sweet initially, fairly flat (wheaty?), dropping off into wateriness and eventually a dry malt hop flavour. Good start, less impressive finish.

Ushers Summer Madness;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Substantial cottage-cheese-like head, massively clinging to the glass as I drank it--fabulous!

Ushers Summer Madness;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);As far as I'm aware, wheat beers are pretty much an unknown in the UK and this turned up another surprise. Pretty smooth and fullish throughout but finishes with a nice citric bite that lingers well into the aftertaste.

Harpers Light;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Harpers Brewing Company;On tap at Harpers, listed simply as Harpers Ale. Quite bland, as the previous reviewer mentioned. Light, bready malt and very light earthy hops characterize the aroma and flavor of this straw-colored beer for the beer novice. It’s not unpleasant, but there’s simply not much here to comment on. This was tapped out on my previous visit so people must crave it.
Harpers Light;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Harpers Brewing Company;Tasted a little more like beer than water, but not much. Not much flavor, not much aroma. Very, very boring beer.
Harpers Spartan Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;Pour on tap at the brewery, clear golden orange pour with thin white head, aroma is grass, straw, some biscuit, touch of slight spice into a hint of lemon, orange peel as well. Taste was a mix of orange, lemon, some grass into some biscuit, slight yeast, finishing sweet.
Harpers Spartan Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;Draft at harpers. This was late in the night so I might be giving it too much credit.
Harpers Spartan Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;hazy light golden with small head. it’s inoffensive, but fairly bland other than a hint of sweetness and some wheat.
Harpers Spartan Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;Spartan Wheat is a very drinkable wheat beer and probably the best beer of the four mainstays at Harper’s Brewpub. It pours a rich orange color, usually cloudy and is pretty smooth. You gotta figure this is a college town so the ability to chug a beer is a big factor in every beer they make. But in general this beer will remind you of an oberon or rich wheat not very Hefe at all....a great summer ale.
Harpers Spartan Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Cloudy, light yellow straw color with small white head. Semi sweet wheat aroma with an interesting fruit aroma as it warmed. Sweet grain with citrus and lemon peel. Medium to light body, watery with light carbonation. Grainy and sweet.
Harpers Spartan Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;Was on tap half off night. Smelled good and tasted sweet with citrus. My favorite Harpers beer of the ones I have tasted. I liked it. Helped that the Spartans beat Purdue.
Harpers Spartan Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;Pours a hazy yellow color with a thin white head. Aroma of lemon. Boring flavor of lemon with a weird aftertaste. The body is light with a creamy texture and the carbonation is soft.
Harpers Spartan Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;On tap at Harpers. Bright orange-yellow body, thin off-white head. Light, sweet aroma with notes of wet hay. Bready and fruity, no banana or clove character. Sweeter than most American Wheats, and quite lemony (echoing other sentiments here). Thin-medium body, tight carbonation.
Harpers Spartan Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;Very light tasting wheat beer. Tasted more like lemonaide than a beer. Good for a casual beer drinker, but not for a seasoned taster. Boring beer.
Harpers Spartan Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;Slightly better than its dirty sister, Hapers Raspberry Wheat, but that isnt saying much. These guys should just close up shop and stick to serving Busch like every other bar in EL does. Terrible. It looks halfway decent, but once the scourge hits your tongue, you are taken aback. Nothing to it, unispired effort is all I have to say.
Harpers Raspberry Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpers Brewing Company;Draft at harpers. Super sweet aroma of artificial raspberries with the flavor to match. Sticky and weird.
Harpers Raspberry Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpers Brewing Company;light pink with minimal head. basically add some raspberry flavor to the otherwise flavor-lacking Spartan Wheat. pleasant enough, but unremarkable.
Harpers Raspberry Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpers Brewing Company;On tap t the BP milky grapefruit juice color with small, white, fizzy head. Raspberry syrup aroma, grainy. Flavor is sweet and syrupy with grain, some grapefruit and citrus flavors. Medium to light watery body with light carbontion. Super sweet and fake tasting, this is everything I dislike about fruit beers.
Harpers Raspberry Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpers Brewing Company;Was on tap half off night. Smelled like perfume and tasted like it as well, artificial tasting. Also tastes sweet, with no hints of beer flavor. Aftertaste was wierd not that good. Maybe an OK beer for some.
Harpers Raspberry Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpers Brewing Company;My impression is that this is what non-beer drinkers drink on half-off night at Harpers. Raspberry dominates the flavor in a way that makes the beer unenjoyable. I appreciate amazing beers, but still enjoy drinking lower quality beer. I can’t drink this one though. I’d rather drink 5 Busch Lights for the price of one Harper’s Raspberry Wheat.
Harpers Raspberry Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpers Brewing Company;i guess i liked this one a bit more than the others...cloudy-orange body with small white head..aroma of sweet raspberry and light wheat..flavor is the same with added bread and biscuit...somewhat artificial, but not bad overall
Harpers Raspberry Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpers Brewing Company;Hazy orange pour with a thin white head. Strong aroma and flavor of boring, artificial raspberries. The body is light and creamy. Boring.
Harpers Raspberry Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpers Brewing Company;Very sweet. Raspberry taste was the overwhelming taste. More of a candy beer, less of a wheat beer. It could have been better if the berry flavor were less dominating.
Harpers Raspberry Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpers Brewing Company;What do you get when you mix Busch with cherry Koolaid mix and a bunch of sugar? You get this beer. Has to be the nastiest beer Ive had. The soroiety sluts chug this stuff like nobodys business, that should tell you something. It really tastes and looks like Koolaid, just a bit more bitter.The restaurant is equally as bad. But then again, what place in EL has good food or beer?
Harpers Raspberry Wheat;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harpers Brewing Company;On tap at Harpers. Murky reddish-orange body, thin off-white head. Heavy, sticky, sweet raspberry syrup aroma that carried over to the flavor, which was dominated by too-sweet raspberries, overwhelming any expected wheat flavors. Medium-full bodied and dense, but not in a particularly enjoyable way. I’ve tried numerous raspberry-flavored beers, and they only seem to work in association with sour Belgian yeast strains. Good for a sip or two but that’s about it.
Harpers Hemp Ale;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Harpers Brewing Company;A fairly unremarkable brew. A faint citrus aroma which can also be detected initially in the flavor. The finish is a bit watered down.
Harpers Hemp Ale;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Harpers Brewing Company;Nice grey-yellow appearance, and a wacky, weird aroma - must be the hemp. But this ale tastes just like an American Standard. Nothing special - and I had such high hopes! :)
Harpers Hemp Ale;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Harpers Brewing Company;It's a little disconcerting getting that strong toasted edge in such a light colored brew, but I ended up liking this a lot. The nuttiness was a nice compliment to the orange citrus action. It might be a touch fizzy, but it's a solid summer brew. Only 18 IBUs.
Harpers Hemp Ale;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Harpers Brewing Company;Nice reddish glow to this one, with a nice lace following the beer to the bottom, which I reached too fast. It is a heavier hopped beer then I normally like, but it worked with this one. Of the four I've had at Harper's this was my favorite.
Oggis Black Mountain Pale Ale;San Clemente, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;Kinda cloudy, light cooper. Up-front grapefruit citrus fading to a tart sour apple aftertaste. A slight hint of malt in the background. One or two would be good with pizza, but not a quaffer. (Oggi's Carmel Mt. Ranch)
Harpers London Porter;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Porter;Harpers Brewing Company;Dark brown pour with a thin beige head. Decent aroma of coffee and black chocolate with a bitter finish. The body is light with a dry mouthfeel and moderate carbonation.
Harpers London Porter;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Porter;Harpers Brewing Company;"On draft at the brew pub. A ""big"" porter - more like a stout, lots of roasted malt, roasted aroma, roasted flavor. These guys should try serving this under nitrogen."
Harpers London Porter;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Porter;Harpers Brewing Company;Light head for a porter. Nice roastiness, like PsychProf I think the chocolate was subdued, but this was alright. A tasty porter.
Harpers London Porter;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Porter;Harpers Brewing Company;"I'll agree with Sean here on the ""muddied"" comment - also called London Porter at 27 IBUs. Fairly standard, good closing bitterness but a bit strange/chemically, not chocolate overloaded."
Harpers London Porter;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Porter;Harpers Brewing Company;"Called the ""London Porter"" when I had it on tap, claiming 27 IBUs. Unfortunately for this beer, I drank it on the same night I saw Natalie McMaster in concert at the Wharton Center. Natalie is, to my ears, the premier fiddle player in the universe, full of grace and energy and creativty. Her ability to blend genres and explode through styles is amazing - she can do a lot of things very well. This beer tries to do a lot of things - heavy chocolate malt, significant smoky element, alternating blasts of burnt coffee and sweet chocolate. It has a dazzling fresh aroma and a nice thick brown appearance, but what it all adds up to is muddied by all that is going on. The Natalie concert was amazing because she did so much and pulled it off - this beer is good, maybe very good, but not amazing becuase it doesn't have the concentrated ease of the Cape Breton fiddler."
Harpers Belgian Wit;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;"An ok beer. By far my favorite from Harper’s. Is overall pretty light in flavor; has some spices and floral notes but mostly citrus flavors."
Harpers Belgian Wit;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;On tap, yellow, yeasty and citrusy. A Hoegaarden-inspired beer that I would prefer to most others from Harper’s. Seems like it would make for a nice summer beer for sitting outside, but I’ve only seen it in the winter.
Harpers Belgian Wit;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;The pour reveals a cloudy yellow color with a thin white head. Boring aroma and flavor of citrus. The palate is light and creamy and the carbonation is moderate.
Harpers Belgian Wit;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;On tap at Harpers. Cloudy yellow-orange body, thin off-white head. Grassy, bready aroma with spice and a nice citrus bite. Surprisingly yeasty flavor profile, with nice perfumey notes and coriander, bready, grassy, yet with plenty of citrus (orange) bite. Light bitterness. Smooth and quaffable, a pleasant beer from this brewer.
Eurobräu Cannabis Red Power;Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Flavored - Other;Brauerei Ganter Freiburg;"Herbaceous and cereal smell. Round, malty and slightly toasted aroma. The 8% alcohol content is only noticeable except in the end, a good sign of quality in the production process. Taste tending to sweet with hints of caramel and fruit. Bitter balanced. Considering that it is a high alcoholic Bock the foam is persistent. For sure the best ""Cannabis"" beer in the market!"
Eurobräu Cannabis Red Power;Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Flavored - Other;Brauerei Ganter Freiburg;330ml bottle from a shop in Naples, drunk in the hotel. Pours clear with a frothy head that soon settled to the surface, heavy lacing and a persistent bead. Brilliant orange in colour - far too bright to be natural. Faint aroma of sour overripe fruit. In the mouth, sweetness is present from the first sip, sourness and medium bitterness kick in early with a strong spirit presence, and some murky citrus flavours. A sour and bitter finish fails to hide the excessive sugar. Overall, horrible and unnecessary.
Eurobräu Cannabis Red Power;Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Flavored - Other;Brauerei Ganter Freiburg;33cl Bottle @ Bodecall, Malaga, Spain.

Only beer in the fridge that would be a tick, I worried it might be a naff gimmick and it was.

Eurobräu Cannabis Red Power;Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Flavored - Other;Brauerei Ganter Freiburg;33 cl bottle, bad looking design, zero expectations. Gold color, clear, big stable white head, alcoholic smell. Aroma of sweet sugary pale malts, starch, cardboard, some strawy hops. Sweetish taste, folloewed by a metallic bitterness. There isn’t any trace of hemp whatsoever, even the label does not mention it as ingredient, so this is a plain strong lager. No good, boring.
Café du Centre Blonde;Champéry, Switzerland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Café du Centre;"Blond hazy ale. Very nice floreal and fruity hop aroma, but it loses fast its feature. Dry mouth, pleasant malt, a background note of roasted malt, not very impressive; quite simple palate. Beers of Switzerland"

Wisconsin Dells Porter;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;I’ve been chasing this one down for five years, and was lucky to have stopped at the brewpub while it was on draught. Pours an opaque dark brown colored brew with a creamy dark beige head that has some excellent retention and lacing. Aroma of toasted dark malt, some coffee essence, and some west coast citrusy hops. Taste is medium bodied, some extra carbonation with flavors of chocolate malt, coffee, grapefruit and a hint of lime zest. Finish is semi-dry with aftertastes of mild spicy/grassy hops, a hint of coffee and tasted black malt. An americanized porter with a character resembling a light Black IPA.
Wisconsin Dells Porter;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Tap. Very dark black pour with just a hint of brown highlights. Lathery white head. Aroma of roasted oats. Roast, chocolate, and a touch of hop on taste. Good brew.
Wisconsin Dells Porter;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;On tap on Jan 19, 2007. Dark color. Smell of malt, roasted coffee, and hints of chocolate. Taste of Sour apples??? Almost like a apple vinegar taste. Can also taste malt, hops, coffee and some coco. I wonder if there was something wrong with this beer?
Wisconsin Dells Porter;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Dark near opaque brown color with a smaller bone colored head. Roasted and crystal malt aromas. Touch of mocha in the nose as well. Smooth and relaxing brew. Just enough sweet malt to balance the black malt bitterness. A touch more hops would have been welcome, but picking at nits a bit.
Wisconsin Dells Porter;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Deep brown body with big brown head. Aroma is roasted, malty and light coffee.

Black Wolf Lomond Gold;Stirling, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Black Wolf Brewery;500ml bottle. Pours a blonde gold with a small off white head. Don’t get very much in the aroma apart from some sweet malts, light citrus and a bit of a floral tang. Light in the mouth with a bit of carbonation. First thing I got was like a German lager type taste. It is pretty sweet and floral with a touch of zesty citrus. It’s refreshing and pretty decent stuff, just a little too sweet for my liking.

Finish is smooth, creamy, soft carbonation with an excellent balanced aftertaste of light banana bread a yeast.
Wisconsin Dells Weissbier;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;I was suprised by this beer. Judging from the other rating this is an inconsistant batch. I tried this on tap at the brewpub in the Wisconsin Dells. My expectations were low, but I felt the brewers created a quality beer true to its stlyle. I am a big fan of Ayinger’s Brau Weisse, and honestly it would be difficult to tell the difference between this wheat beer, and that of Ayinger.

I don’t know if I got into an ""off"" batch of it, but the growler that I bought on the first day tasted pretty typical, but on the second day it had a very strong hop aroma and taste. I averaged the 2 tastings."

Palmetto Charleston Lager;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Palmetto Brewing Company;12 oz.bottle with no date code found Pilsner glass A: Very nice looking bright crystal clear medium yellow with an inch of fluffy head atop and bubbles busily rising. S: Malty, grainy smell without most of the skunk others have mentioned. Slight earthy hop note, so maybe that’s it. Not much smell overall but nothing bad. T: Crisp crackery malt taste with again a hit of earthiness. This actually is fairly reminiscent of a euro lager but not in a bad way. I do not taste corn. A little on the watery side but pretty good tasting. M: Light bodied to the point of being a bit watery but nice bubble scrub makes it refreshing and easy drinking. Very clean finishing as expected. O: This beer is overall pretty average but has good points. Nothing bad to report unless you’re sensitive to earthy (skunky) hints. Not worth seeking but I bought this in a gas station and it was an outstanding choice considering the limited options. Points taken for lack of date coding leave my overall rating below average.

Palmetto Charleston Lager;Charleston, South Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Palmetto Brewing Company;I wasn’t sure how this would go when I picked up a scent of Heinecken-ish skunkality upon sniffing. But I ended up really liking it. It *does* have a little bit of fresh skunk to it up front, but that morphs very nicely into a nice, grainy fullness.

Aroma- Has some grain and hops but does has a slight skunk aroma. Appearance- Pours an amber color with a large white head. Taste- Not very good to me, has a heavy grain flavor with an odd yeast aftertaste. Palate- A medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation This beer has a dry finish.

Websters Green Label Best;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);Cask (handpump) at the Litten Tree, Westminster, from old notes. I’d always been led to believe Litten Tree Best Bitter was a rebadge of Courage Best, but obviously not. Didn’t pay much attention to the ABV (I’m not sure it was even displayed). Apart from the standard copper colour, this is very poor fare. A dull and lifeless bitter with very little flavour and zero character. Very anaemic and watery. Not helped by being served in poor condition but wouldn’t have been much cop anyway. The best that can be said is that this was an unexpected tick.

Barnsley Bitter;Blackpool, Lancashire, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blackpool;First tasted this bitter at the Hogshead, Paisley in June 1999. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear copper in colour with a thin white head. Slight malt note in the nose, thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a rich digestive teabiscuit flavour like Tetleys. Slight hint of dry raisin fruit but this fades fast. Hop resins add a bitter edge to the aftertaste. The finish is bitter sweet. A decent session bitter.

Barnsley Bitter;Blackpool, Lancashire, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blackpool;Cask, Rose's, Woolwich. Gold colour with a stiff foam. Flavoursome with a good body and a lovely balance of sweet malt and citric hops. the hops progressively make themselves more noticable as drink proceeds, but the beer always remains sweet and juicy. More in the style of an American Pale Ale or a Golden Summer than a traditional bitter. Very tasty and refreshing sesion ale.

Bulldog Harvest Hefeweizen;Fresno, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Bulldog Brewing Company (CA);Quite tart - appearance was cloudy on the batch that I had a pour from. Pretty refreshing after hiking all day. Nice establishment in Fresno as well.
Bulldog Harvest Hefeweizen;Fresno, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Bulldog Brewing Company (CA);I expect an unfiltered wheat beer to be cloudy, but this one is completely transparent. If it were not for the description, I would say that it's filtered. The flavor was a little bland, but the feel was so sparkly and refreshing. Not my favorite wheat beer.
Bulldog Blonde;Fresno, California, United States;Cream Ale;Bulldog Brewing Company (CA);Smooth drinking, no bad aftertaste - little bit on the the light side for my taste. Good compliment to pizza though.

Fruity malt aroma accompanied by some lighter hops. Flavor is pretty bitter, light malt, not the greatest of balance. Palate is a little too dry and the body is lacking. Decent beer, though.
Pearl Street American Beauty;Buffalo, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pearl Street Grill & Brewery (NY);"not a great beer. Sligtly lagery for some reason. Noble/herbal hops.

Halve Maan Grof Geschut;Hulst, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Bierbrouwerij Vermeersen (previously known as de Halve Maan);"13-03-2019; bottle; at home (bought at an unknown location). The looks of the beer are nice. Very nice. The beer is very dark. The lovely dark chestnut with copper reddish brown glow is very appealing. On top no foam is formed at all. Non whatsoever. The beer looks syrupy, a bit thicker than usual. Looks very appealing though. Should be good. The aromas of the beer are also nice. Malts are sweet and syrupy. Lovely, rich, smooth and sweet. There are loads of caramel and toffee. Also a slight touch of liquorice. There are also nice touches of plum and dried fruits. Rich, and lovely. Tobacco and a touch of roast finish it completely. Hops play only a minor role with some herbal notes. The taste of the beer is lovely. Rich and full sweetness, bitter hops. The beer is very sweet, but the bitterness is capable of balancing the sweetness very well. The result is a well balanced beer. Noice. The palate is nice. Full body, silky smooth and slightly thick texture and low carbonation. The finish of the beer is very nice. It is filled with tobacco an plum, dried fruits and caramel + syrup. All in all, a very nice rich beer. I am pleased."

Bärnstensfärgad med en del skum, men sedan försvinner det helt - ser mycket tråkigt ut i glaset. Maltig och brödig doft med inslag av färskt gräs. Brödig smak, relativt söt och med inslag av citrus. Inte mycket till beska. Detta ska vara en 'premium' öl då den kostar ca 5-6 kronor mer än de flesta övriga öl från samma land eller stil. Ölen har 6 % ABV och det känner man i smaken, då alkoholen slår igenom smaken.

Den Blå Nykøbing;Faxe, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal Unibrew;Marielyst 21/10 2017. 33 cl bottle from Meny. Girl in Folk Dancer Costume smiling at me from the label. Looks like something from the fifties that somebody forgot to remove from the label. Pours clear golden yellow with white head. Settles as thin layer of foam barely covering the surface of the beer. Very moderate lacing. Aroma is of grains and straw but not too sweet. Sourish bitterness lurking in the background. Medium carbonation and watery palate. Flavor is medium sweet balanced by medium bitterness. A little bit rough. Aftertaste is bitter with a metallic tang of alcohol. Decent pale lager of the stronger variety. Not too sweet. Not subtle in any way but you can get a decent buzz in the good Company of the Folk Dancer Girl.

Den Blå Nykøbing;Faxe, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal Unibrew;This beer is in many ways a discount beer. Brew method with broad application of corn grits and syrup is a clear sign of this. But among the large selection of discount beer is this beer still one of the best when it comes to the crunch. The aroma reveals flower and a hint of hops. The foam is fairly stable and the taste sweet with touch of flower. Hop bitterness is carefully and it is an easy to drink beer, certainly best when it is well cooled. It is acceptable.

Šariš Premium 12%;Velký Šariš, Slovakia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Plzenský Prazdroj Slovensko (Asahi);Neben dem Zlatý Bažant ist das Šariš wohl eines der Bier, die man in der Slowakei am öftesten antrifft. Es handelt sich bei den 12% keineswegs um den Alkoholgehalt, sondern um die Stammwürze -wir haben es also mit einem stärkeren, vollmundigeren Hellen zu tun. Als solches steht es über dem Zehngrädigen und würzemäßig auch über den bekannten deutschen und österreichischen Hellen. Eigentlich ganz gut, aber nix spezielles. Die Brauerei gehört inzwischen zum größten Brauereikonglomerat AB InBev, weshalb ich lieber andere slowakische Biere bevorzuge.

Straubinger Weisse Original;Straubing, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Röhrl;Trocken hefig-herb malziger Start. Wie das helle Weizen scheint auch dieses einfach gestrickt und nicht unbedingt eine Aromenbombe zu sein, leicht erhöhte Karbonisierung, im Mittelteil etwas intensiver als zuvor. Dabei ist das Malz führend und bildet karamellige Hintergrundnoten, die Hefigkeit unterliegt weiterhin der allgemeinen Trockenheit. 8/9/8/9/8/8

Straubinger Weisse Original;Straubing, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Röhrl;Bernsteinfarbiges Traditionsweizen aus Straubing. Schaum und Farbe sind schön. Geruch ist hefig, grassig und erdig. Im Antrunk recht hernb und ohne Suesse. Der Körper ist ein Fortsatz des Einstiegs - dieses Bier ist ein herbes fast bitteres Weizen. Darunter leidet die Süffigkeit, auch wenn es durchaus ein Aha-Effekt gibt ob dieser Trockenheit des Geschmacks. Abgang ist gut graduell. Fazit: Ein Interessantes Weizen, was leider zu herb ist für mein Geschmack.

Bräunlinger Löwenbräu Weisser Leo;Bräunlingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Löwenbrauerei Bräunlingen;50cl MHD11/2018from source. - Spicy speciment of an oldschool regional Weizen variable to heavy batch change: canned white pepper in stewed stone fruit, yellow apple, gooseberry jam and minimal banana, less espressive wheat broth infrastructure. Spices include some exotic cinnamon, cardamom even. Traces of rainwater and minimal sulphurs undercutting the spiced fruit basket potential here. - The label design, like its closed Wirtschaft taproom, is due for a major overhaul.

Moderately sweet flavour with a tinge of bitterness, light to medium bodied with a lively carbonation.

Bitter End Highwater Summer Slammer;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;The lemonade of the beer world. Very light and refreshing, good for a 100 degree summer day.
Bitter End Highwater Summer Slammer;Austin, Texas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;They say that this is a golden ale...it is very light, not at all offensive, but definitely one of those refreshing summertime drinks. Had a decent taste, but a very boring, lager-like finish.
Bitter End Armstrong Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Tap. I missed it last time around, but this stuff is back in honor of Lance's attempt at a 5th title. Tastes like an IPA with a little extra malt thrown in there, but it somehow stays very balanced with a very crisp character. I could see this being a good seller; the clean crispness gives it good mass-appeal while the nice balance and hoppiness keeps it selling to us fanatics."
Bitter End Armstrong Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;One of bitter end's best. Wonderful balance of malt and hops. A little less malty than their imperial pale.
Bitter End Armstrong Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Excellent beer! Hazy orange color. As hoppy as a sierra nevada, but balanced extremely well....beautiful malty sweetness which accompanied the fresh hop taste.....one of the best pale ales I have ever tasted.
Artisans Brasseurs Brune de St. Quentin;Namur, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Les Artisans Brasseurs/Brasserie Mibrana;"Amber colour, poor head. Too light aroma (malt, wet paper). Light taste, with some roasted malt and sweetness; no character. Ordinary palate."
Lindens World Beat Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;Draught. Body is hazy medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (cookie), lightly hoppy (flowers). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.
Lindens World Beat Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;Nice, unfiltered, orange-gold appearance. Pleasant if unremarkable, some honey-sweetness in the finish conrasts nicely with a lemon slice. By the way, try the crawfish boil starter. And they made a good burger.
Lindens World Beat Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;Sweet fruitiness up front, almost candy-like. Actually made me think of Fruity Pebbles for some peculiar reason. Light in body. Light, dry, and somewhat watery finish.
Lindens Mosh Pit Wit;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;Cloudy yellow. Mild orange and lemon peel, typically how a wit should be. Rich texture, good Belgian type body and carbonation alongside the coriander. Strong flavor, semi-sweet citrus.
Lindens Mosh Pit Wit;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;Opaque yellow appearance, with a light head. Smells strongly of corriander. The initial flavor is slightly bitter with a strong corriander flavor, slightly sweet, excellent texture, citrusy. Good for a wit, but there is a strong initial flavor, followed by a lingering aftertaste of ginger and corriander, that seems a bit stale.
Lindens Mosh Pit Wit;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;Smells of corriander spiciness with a slight citrus punch. Coloration is typical of a wheat with a lovely cloudy unfiltered appearance. Flavor is sweet, spiced with coriander, and orangey zest. Palate is average for a witbier.
Lindens Mosh Pit Wit;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;Draught. Body is hazy medium yellow. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted grain, cookie), trace yeast (cobwebs), with notes of banana, orange, coriander, and honey. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Fabulous aroma, though just a tad too sweet.
Lindens Mosh Pit Wit;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;In contrast to the previous review I thought this Wit could use more coriander, more orange and a drier finish. Still, drinkable and fairly well balanced but not as thirst quenching as I would have liked.
Lindens Mosh Pit Wit;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;Sweet, aromatic, floral nose, not unlike a rose garden. Smooth and soft mouthfeel. Similar body. Very spicy, somewhat pungeant. Peppery. A little bitter in an atypical way. Too much coriander? Or am I just spice-challenged?
Thomas Kemper RUI Unfiltered Amber (Palomino Integrale);Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;On tap at Palomino Minneapolis. Pours a hazy dark amber with an eighth of an inch (at best) of foam. No head retention, no lacing. Mild tart fruit and malt in the aroma, but nothing noteworthy. Okay, but mild, so far... The beer is mild, but nicely balanced, of malt and hops. Sort of an odd character, it starts out a little roasted (yet it is pale), then a little sweet and fruity and malty, finishing a bit on the tart side. It is just a tad smokey in the finish and aftertaste, completely unexpected and intriguing. Flavors all over the place, but all in balance somehow. Medium body and moderately carbonated, and overall better than I expected.
Thomas Kemper RUI Unfiltered Amber (Palomino Integrale);Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;Draught, Palomino, Indianapolis. Clear amber body with essentially no head. Faint aroma of caramel, whole grains and nuts. A minor hop presence brings out a bit of earth and light pine. The body is smooth and enjoyable, at least for the style. Mostly sweet with the caramel and a light biscuit element taking the forefront. The light twinge of hop bitterness asserts itself enough to be noticed. Not the worst thing in the world, but not something that begs for return visits.
Thomas Kemper RUI Unfiltered Amber (Palomino Integrale);Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;Not impressed. It was only barely distinguishable as an amber, with a weak head and was a little to bitter for it’s own good.
Thomas Kemper RUI Unfiltered Amber (Palomino Integrale);Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;Cloudy ruby amber color thin tan head...smelled quite malty and a little dusty...sweet malty body with a dry hoppy finish...not bad, also quite easy to drink...
Thomas Kemper RUI Unfiltered Amber (Palomino Integrale);Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;On draught at the Palomino in Indianapolis: This beer is a dark amber color with a thin beige head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is kind of roasty and malty. Medium body with a nice combination of malt and hops in the flavor. The finish is lasting and lighty bitter. Better than expected.
Thomas Kemper RUI Unfiltered Amber (Palomino Integrale);Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;Sampled draught at The Flying Saucer, Addison, Texas.

Thomas Kemper RUI Unfiltered Amber (Palomino Integrale);Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;"Sparkling amber. Faint malt nose, faintly malty spiced taste. Seems strange an ""unfiltered"" would be sparkling"
Thomas Kemper RUI Unfiltered Amber (Palomino Integrale);Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;Mild aroma, but really comes to life in tasting. Nice bitter profile, balanced by a tangy sweetness. A little bit bubbly, but overall very solid. Thanks once again Legion242! (on tap, Flying Saucer, Addison, TX)
Thomas Kemper RUI Unfiltered Amber (Palomino Integrale);Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thomas Kemper Brewing Co.;Wonderful mouthfeel.

Sweet notes of soy and molasses and raisins and figs. Toffee and caramel also. Label says it’s been aged for one year prior to bottling and boy does it show! VERY smooth with no signs of heat.

Moku Moku Barley Wine;Nishiyubune, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Moku Moku Brewery;"My Bottom Line: Brown sugar, fruit jam, licorice and caramel gel atop this Barley Wine’s leafy hop finish. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam floats atop the cloudy ruby. -Malts also share biscuity corners. -Alcohol warmth eases each sip’s sweetness. -The flavor profile is balanced. -This is an easily approachable Barley Wine; not a sugar bomb too, which is pleasant.

Die Adelskronen-Reihe ist die Billig-Marke des Hauses Öttinger -als ob das Original-Ötti ein Qualitätsbier wäre, dass eine miese Billigversion nötig hätte... Das Trinken dieses Bieres aus einem Teku-Kelch definiert den Spruch ""Perlen vor die Säue werfen!"" fast neu. Da ich nicht viel erwartet habe, blieb die Enttäuschung aus. Zwischen der unendlichen Wässrigkeit kämpft sich verzweifelt ein Geschack nach Zitrone und Grapefruit hoch. Der Weizenbier-typische Bananen-Geschmack fehlt vollkommen. Ein Bier, das man ohne schlechtem Gewissen nach einer Kostprobe, dem Porzellangott (WC) opfern kann."

The one I bought from a fine food store in Wien had 5.2% ABV. Shining mahogany body with a filmy head. Poor in aroma, but it’s possible to shake up some smell of pale malt and grass.

I was expecting something special, with the nifty looking bottle and all. Nope. To me, this beer was much like a standard German lager or even a weak version of an Oktoberfest. Some malt in the nose, no strong flavors. Aftertaste was not bad, but not that good, either. Just an average beer for me."
Engel Frohe Weihnachten;Schwäbisch Gmünd, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener - Imperial;Engel Brauerei;Comes in a cool white clay/pottery 16oz (pint) that has a Santa Claus on it and a cool painted logo. This beer pours a dark brown color with a small tan head that dies off quickly and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is of a dark malt with an aroma that is strong with the smell of caramel and malts with some hops included as well. The flavor is more smooth than expected with strong hints of the malt with a center of caramel and it finishes up with some hops and the alcohol background. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit.

La Barberie Bitter Cream Ale;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Cream Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Lavender and vanilla join some toasty malts in the aroma. Amber brown body is topped by a short but dense, fine bubbled, off white (nitro?) head that coats the sides of the glass. Metallic otes are strong in the flavour and overpower the light toasted malts. Bitterness is fairly restrained. Some berry like fruitiness especially at the finish. Bland nitro smooth body with soft but uninspired carbonation. Sampled at Mondial 2006.
La Barberie Bitter Cream Ale;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Cream Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Sampled draught at the Mondial de la Bière in Montreal, 2006. Dark amber with a huge lasting head (I think this was served on nitro), nice looking and inviting at any rate....faintly soapy creamy vanilla, mushy grains in the nose, touch of caramelized malt....fairly bitter body, but its more mineralic/metallic than hoppy, and the body is very smooth in that nitro-milky way, which really doesn’t work well with the peppery harshness and spiciness that takes over at the finish. Ahhh another misfire from Barberie.
La Barberie Bitter Cream Ale;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Cream Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Nahhhhhh, not my cup of tea. Not realy bitter, more cream.

Shenandoah Witbier;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Nicely spicy, typical banana/pear fruitiness. Pretty milky pale yellow, kind of like milk combined with lemonade.
Shenandoah Witbier;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Looks like grapefruit juice. Sweet spicy aroma, with hint of banana. Flavorwise, there's a Belgian yeast element, banana up front, spicy, bitter on the tongue with grapefruit & something unpleasant at the end.
Dominion Maniacs;Dover, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Good god the alcohol. Not much on hops, but not supposed to be. Very light body. Where is the alcohol coming from? Noticeable belgian white flavors--spice wise. I like it just for the buzz. :)

Light wheat aroma, slightly fruity. Seems almost hefe in taste -- sweet malty, wheaty, easy going with decent spicy aftertaste.

South Street Hogwaller Kolsch (- 2014);Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;South Street Brewery;My struggle to appreciate Kolsch style beers continues. This one is copper coloured, clean and fresh, but I just didn’t find it (or the other Kolschs I’ve tried) very interesting. Might be nice to pour down your throat as a quaffer on a hot summer’s day (which seems to be what the style was designed for), but any search for nuances of flavour, or character, is in vain. On tap at the brewpub, Charlottesville.

Winthrop Grampa Clems Brown Ale;Winthrop, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Winthrop Brewing Company;Pacific Northwest Vacation 2007 8/21/2007: Winthrop Grampa Clems Brown Ale pours a clear ruby brown color. The molasses flavor is mildly sweet and has a hint of chocolate and caramelized malt/brown sugar. This beer finishes dry with a coffee-like flavor. It has a super mild level of carbonation and is smooth. This is a very good brown ale that tastes kind of like a Riesen chew! Draught sample at the Winthrop Brewing Company in Winthrop, Washington. Rating #6 for this beer...
Winthrop Grampa Clems Brown Ale;Winthrop, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Winthrop Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub. Light brown. Nothing impressive about this one...easy drinking. Not much in the way of hops or roast.
Winthrop Grampa Clems Brown Ale;Winthrop, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Winthrop Brewing Company;Hazy light brown colour. Slightly nutty aroma. With a remarkably light character, this one just sort of disappears on you. The sort of nondescript, pointless brown that does absolutely nothing for me.
Winthrop Grampa Clems Brown Ale;Winthrop, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Winthrop Brewing Company;Very mild brown. The malt profile is extremely mellow in all aspects and kind of hides beneath the modest hopping. The hops are fairly modest, it’s just that with such a mellow roasty caramel character, it sort of takes precedence. This is Mr.Rogers in a glass. Respectable, but very reserved and borderline boring.
Winthrop Grampa Clems Brown Ale;Winthrop, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Winthrop Brewing Company;6/17/03 II thought this was one of the best finds at the Kenmore, WA microbrewfest. Brown amber with a crips wash of head and a nice foresty malt aroma that translates nicely to a chocolate ice cream flavor with a molasses note. A top notch brown. 2-24-07 - I enyoed this brew this weekend and it’s great to see my ratings are consistent 3 1/2 years later. This beer is delightfully complex and roasty for a brown with an interesting brown sugar and chocolate ripple.

A really nice Bitter from a great brewery. Lot of malt aroma and taste from this lil’ doggy. Nuts, caramel, salty pretzels, toast and honey scents.

Pump House Special Old Bitter (S.O.B.);Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Pump House Brewery;341ml bottle. Pours a dark crimson/brown with a foamy off-white head that dissipates slowly, medium-strong retention. Aroma is mild toasted malt, hints of toffee, cocoa. Hop presence is significant, giving the bitter character, but the breadiness of the malt is what makes this beer. Well balanced, medium bodied ale that is easy to drink. Cheers.

Amber colored with some caramel malt aromas and flavors, coupled with some hops and slight fruit and spice. If this is considered a ""black and tan"" clone, then I have no problem deleting it."
Brandywine Blue Rocks Brew;Greenville, Delaware, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brandywine Brewing Company;This is a mix of their amber ale and lager (strange brew?). It came out as an orangeish amber with a malty nose. Weird resultant alcohol-heavy flavor. Didn't care for it.

La Barberie Blanche aux Agrumes;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Bière jaune trouble. Nez évident d’agrumes et d’épices. En bouche c’est très rafraîchissant avec c’est deux mêmes arômes. Peu d’amertume. Bière bien construite mais classique.
La Barberie Blanche aux Agrumes;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;"Bouteille sous le nom de ""Blanche"". Nez de levures fruitée légèrement sûr (agrumes, notes de limonade) et légèrement épicées (coriandre) et quelques notes de blé. Plutôt mince en bouche et assez pétillante avec une texture légèrement savonneuse. Goût de levures fruitées aux notes acides et sûres (agrume – citron, léger d’orange, rappelant vaguement une limonade douce) avec un léger goût de coriandre lors de l’entrée en bouche suivi d’un goût léger de malt (miel doux) et de blé et finalement un léger goût de levures accompagnées de petites notes herbeuses ainsi que de traces de gingembre. Post-goût moyen et un peu sec, légèrement amer de levures et de fruits (zeste citronné)."
La Barberie Blanche aux Agrumes;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Part of a sampler tray at the brewery. Low carbonation. Citrusy aftertaste. Average beer.
La Barberie Blanche aux Agrumes;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Completely cloudy yellow-orange with an average white head. Strong orange aroma. Orange and grassy taste. Orange taste is too dominant, almost feels like a breakfast juice. Peppery finish. Watery and oily body. I’m starting to feel as if the odds of Barberie brewing a good beer are about the same as the odds of meeting black people while yachting. 500ml bottle.
La Barberie Blanche aux Agrumes;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Bottle. Golden color with sediment and white head. Coriander and fruits (citrus) aroma. Taste of citrus and lemon. taste like a limonade. Bière de couleur doré avec des particules dans sa robe et un collet blanc. Odeur de coriandre er de fruits (agrumes). Au goût, c’est les agrumes et surtout le citron, on dirait une limonade.
La Barberie Blanche aux Agrumes;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;"Smallish white head, looking somewhat coarse because of the large bubbles. Body is a kind of muddy yellow. Aroma is interesting; kind of thin, and fruity, with strange notes of soap, tea, and something darker. Very powerful taste, with strong notes of what seems like grapefruit; very sour. There are promising things in the taste, but the grapefruit overwhelms it and makes it hard to come to terms with. Didn’t really enjoy this, but the aroma is nice. A beer to smell, but not to drink, I guess is the conclusion. (0.5l bottle in glass.) Looking up ""agrumes"" in a French dictionary I see that it means ""citrus fruit"". Yeah. That figures."
La Barberie Blanche aux Agrumes;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Nice dark gold cloudy body with good carbonation. Head is foamy, dense and lasting. Yeasty aroma with strong citrusy hints. After such a good strart, I’ve been quite disappointed by the taste. Mouthfeel is dominated by an unpleasant sourness and a lack of malty or hoppy flavors. It almost tastes like the mix of carbonated water and lemon juice I used to drink when I was training for marathon. There’s a lot of work to do on that one...
La Barberie Blanche aux Agrumes;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Average rating posted. Re-rate (02/06/04 7-4-8-2-14=3.5): Clean smelling lemon-grass aroma with notes of sulfur. Hazy opaque yellow body with thin white line of head. Lemon biscuit crunch with nice balancing bitterness to the finish. A bit undercarbonated. Feels thin. On tap at Mondial 2004). Original Rating (02/05/04 - 2-1-2-1-2=0.8): Sickly sweet aroma. Oranges and spice apparent but there is something funky here too. Clear bolnd colour with no head. Sour flavour with some oranges and limes. Thin body. No carbonation. Undrinkable. Bottle.
La Barberie Blanche aux Agrumes;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Gold and light haze... seems almost too dark and too clear to be a wit. Aromas of lemons, ginger, and pine. The dominant flavor is lemon as well, with some very potent spice notes... although not the corriander that you'd expect. Unbalanced, and lacks the subtlety and refreshment that I've come to associate with this style. I'm glad I tried it (thanks radiomgb), but it's a hard beer to like.
La Barberie Blanche aux Agrumes;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;hazy gold, fluffy and lacy white head. aroma of orange, lemons, lemongrass, pepper and coriander. very lemony with mild solvent notes int he flavour. not bad.
Micks Red;London, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);En fût il y a longtemps. Rousse, la version Labatt de la Molson Rickard’s Red. Disponible dans plusieurs restaurants. Un peu insipide, céréales, un peu de houblon. Un classique dans le temps.
Micks Red;London, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Originally rated February 2005. Poured an amber-red colour with a descent head. Aroma was very light with hints of fruits. The taste had a bit more presence, with malt, fruits and slight toffee all mixed together. Carbonation was heavy and mouthfeel was thin. This is Labatt’s answer to Molson’s Rickard’s Red. The two biggest Canadian macros attempt to red ales. I prefer Mick’s as it is at least refreshing, and Rickard’s gives me headaches.
Micks Red;London, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Labatt’s version of Rickard’s Red. Too bad it doesn’t come close. Pours a deep amber with a small thin white head. Aroma of caramel and malt. Taste is malty with some caramel notes. If you have a choice, go Rickard’s for a macro.
Micks Red;London, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);on tap in Niagara Falls, Canada. Great red beer. Wish I could find it in the states. USA beer is gross.
Micks Red;London, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);[405-20070707] Tap @ Le Bifteque (Toronto, ON). Yeasty grainy aroma has a hint of floral sweetness. Clear, bright red body with a medium-lasting bubbly white head. Grainy yeast flavour holds same hint of sweetness. Medium body is fairly smooth. Like Rickard’s only smoother and refreshing, best chilled.
Micks Red;London, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Refreshing, I needed a good Canadian beer, and this one reminds me my previous visit. It is like a Brittish ale but with the Canadian peculiar flavour. I like it and good foam.
Micks Red;London, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Not bad, not bad at all. Red pint as the name declares. Once again, another one of those ""drunk"" beers. From tap of a local pool/bar. I wasn’t as focused on the flavour, but I was happy that it was going down easy. Tasted like barley and burnt hops. Beats drinking a macro."
Micks Red;London, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Above average for this macrobrewery. Some pronounced bitterness and average malt character. Amberish with lasting white head. Not a bad drinkability, drying aftertaste.
Micks Red;London, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Druaght. Not much in the way of smell: a bit of malt and breadiness. Same goes for the flavour, which is multilayered (citrus, bread, caramel malts), none of which melds together in a synergistic way, nor are any of them particularly ""good."" Better than some macros, but still with that factory-made taste we all know and hate."
Micks Red;London, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Amber beer, thin off-white head. Aroma is decently malty, light caramel and a some herbal hop aroma. A bit industrial and grainy tasting. Still, it’s better than I expected... even still, it isn’t all that good.
Farmington River Mahogany Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Tap at Willimantic.

Farmington River Mahogany Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12oz bottle in a shaker. Pours copper with an off-white head. Aroma of nuts and cereal with a little floral hops. The flavor has a smooth maltiness with the nuts, caramel, cereal and dough notes. Not too bitter. A pretty good beer for this style.
Farmington River Mahogany Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;I’m not a big fan of bitter. I’ve found it a pretty boring beer style so far. Not a lot of aroma. Taste is thin and not very flavorful and it washes away quickly. I was expecting some hoppiness somewhere along the way but none presented itself.
Farmington River Mahogany Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle poured a clear amber with a small lingering amber head. Aromas of carmel, earthiness and a hint of fruittiness. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a dry finish. Flavors of carmel, earthiness and a hint of citrus with a crisp dry finish.
Farmington River Mahogany Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;A: snifter. pours a really nice opaque pale mahogany color. gorgeous dark khaki colored head with a typical/expected retention level. moderate lacing. S: some apple and caramel notes from the malts, with a nice solid hoppy addition. some light citrus brought in from the hops. T: very well-balanced. a little bittersweet, with more hops to me. I get some fruits, mostly apples, and some nutty notes, as well as a hint of butterscotch. very nice flavors from an ESB. M: full bodied, mild carbonation level. very complex palate for the style, bitters and sweetness invigorate the tongue. D: very nice brew, well worth getting and enjoying. would definitely drink again.
Farmington River Mahogany Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"(bottle) Reddish-brown body with a big, off-white head with peaks. Very aromatic - malt, hops, very floral, sugar/cotton candy, grass, wild berries. Medium body and soft with carbonation. Flavor has caramel malt and hops that are moderately bitter. Bitterness increases in the finish, but there is also a slightly metallic flavor that lingers in the aftertaste and detracts from what is otherwise very good; but even so, it doesn’t have a huge effect."
Farmington River Mahogany Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12 oz bottle from a coworker. Poured an intriguing amber color with orange upper edges and red lower edges with an average sized white head. Aroma of tea, chocolate, maple, saw dust, dirt. The body is fuller with average carbonation and a slightly chalky mouthfee. Flavor of earth, tea, and chocolate. Odd for the style but good enought to drink.
Farmington River Mahogany Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Big thanks to the lil’ beer doctor for this brew! Nice clean beery aroma. Hazy darker brew but not dark brown. Malty ale ish flavors with some bitterness in there. A kind personality with decent carbonation. Pearcing finish on the back of the throat. Evolves from mildy interesting to tongue sharp bitter. Nice rings of lacing. Has some mild oily bite like many IPA. Much more bitter than many other in this style.
Farmington River Mahogany Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Draft @ Monster B’s. Nice amber brown body with fizzy white head. Great session beer. Even hop/malt balance with a refreshing long lasting aftertaste. This beer is tough to find, but if you do find it, get it.

Bischofshof Prälat Pilsener;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Bischofshof;Overall a good example of modern German Pils: nice and clean, with moderate alcohol content and decent bitterness. This brewery makes a number of excellent products and their Pils is what you would expect from a full-bodied Bavarian lager.
Bischofshof Prälat Pilsener;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Bischofshof;Very Nice Pilsener. Good crisp and clean mouthfeel. Nice color. Good aroma. Very Very Good on a Hot day.

Bischofshof Prälat Pilsener;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Bischofshof;It’d be nice if we could land this beer a bit more frequently in the Bay Area. Aroma is grassy and a bit metallic (think a dirty nickel). Appearance was clear, yellow in color with a very nice head with good lacing. Mouthfeel was a little lazy as it didn’t have that feel a good pilsner has. Flavor had a definite hoppy character to it with a satisfying finish. Overall a decent German pils. I’d imagine this would be even better fresh.
Bischofshof Prälat Pilsener;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Bischofshof;On Tap, grassiness, some bread, very light color, almost a green tint to it in the light, easy drinking, very refreshing, abit of spice too, nice brew!
Bischofshof Prälat Pilsener;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Bischofshof;From a 500 ml. brown euro bottle with a freshness date on the back label, 01.01.05. This pilsener actually held up pretty well. Poured a clear yellowish golden with a foamy white that settled into a thin sudsy lacing. Aromas of sweet grains and biscuits, lemon honey, floral and spicy hops. Medium carbonation and a crisp, smooth pilsener light bodied mouthfeel. Delicious tasting, sweet honey breads, lemon grassy, peppery and spicy herbal hops and a dry grainy, spicy and lemon grassy finish, very good drinkability. On a hot midwestern summer day this is highly quaffable, I would like to find a fresher bottle of this, I have the feeling it is even more tasty when you get it before it’s freshness date has expired. Purchased at the Friar Tuck in Springfield, Illinois.
Bischofshof Prälat Pilsener;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Bischofshof;Nice pour, a lively golden body with a sustained creamy head that does some lasting lacing. The aroma is that of fresh bread artfully blended with a grassy bitterness. The nose follows into the mouth (?!), finishing on a mildly bitter note. Good stuff. Friar Tuck Wines, Sprirts, & Beverages, Peoria, IL
Bischofshof Prälat Pilsener;Regensburg, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Bischofshof;Lightly hazed light golden color. tall milky white head. Grassy hops with a pils malt backdrop. Had hoped for a more noble nose. Soft malt flavors abound. Very mild herbal hops and a nice light bite in the finish coupled with a light pale malt linger. The temperatures hit the 50s today and already I am looking forward to Pils season. If this is global warming, bring it on!

Town Hall Dunkleweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Growler: amber pour off white head. Bubblegum fruity ester and banana aroma. Sweet caramel and banana flavor with a bubble gum finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Town Hall Dunkleweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;16 oz. pour, on tap at the brewpub. Consumed on 1-21-09. Listed on the menu as being called “Dark German Wheat.” Aroma of banana, orange Jolly Ranchers, lemon, skittles, and butter. Floral, yeasty, and very refreshing and appetizing smell. Pours a hazy dark amber with a small amount of head. Malty, tangy, spicy taste features milk chocolate and clove. It’s not as flavorful as I would like. Light to medium body. Like many hefeweizens, the aroma is stronger than the flavor.
Town Hall Dunkleweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;At Town Hall, pint appears brown with a short lived head and little lace. The aroma is banana and some spice. The flavor is mostly malty, with the banana clove thing going on. The palate is cold, carbonated, and wet. This is good for washing down any food. Cold and wet.
Town Hall Dunkleweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Draft: dark brown, slightly sweet aroma, banana and clover taste, more of the clover than the banana, medium mouthfeel, this one was solid but it isn’t one I’d order again.
Town Hall Dunkleweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Decent dunkle, and a style I like to drink. On-tap at the brewpub. Cloudy medium brown. Hoppy, and that hit first, then sourness through to the finish. Decent malting to keep up the drinkability. Medium or better mouthfeel.A nice one that I would have again - nailed the style.
Town Hall Dunkleweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Shaker pint draft at the brewpub. Hazed brown orange pour with no head. Served really cold. Aroma of wheat, clove and some ripe banana fruit. A touch of earthiness. Taste is hefe - with a bit of roasted flavor to the back. Get the cloves, citrus and bananas. Nothing too big or overpowering. Nice enough Dunkel.
Town Hall Dunkleweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Murky brown mixed with crimson coloration, solid swath of creamy white caps the top. Sweetness in the nose, wheaty, whiffs of banana and spice. Soft and airy. Much fruit in the flavor, banana, some citrus and clove, some caramel from the malt, and it’s all very smooth and flavorful. Lush and lovely. Smooth and easy-drinking, refreshing, just enough wheat texture. Medium-bodied, with plentiful flavor. Yum, yum, bubblegum.
Town Hall Dunkleweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Growler from footbalm. Dark brown with small white head. The aroma was of bananas, clove, and yeast. The taste was the same with weird cigarette ash taste. After awhile it began to smell like cigarette smoke. Crazy. Eric warned me about this one........
Town Hall Dunkleweizen;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Creamy Dark Brown Color with Creamy White Head. Light Dark Malt Notes on the Nose...Very Subtle. Sweet Malt Notes...Followed by Bitter Hop Notes and a Wheat Aftertaste..The Malt Notes Give Off a Smokey Flavor...Some Chocolate and Spices..Notably Cloves.. Initially a Wet Mouthfeel...Moving Towards a Dry Wheat Aftertaste...
Town Hall Peach Lambic;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Lovely color of purest peach, adorned with a standard white, 1/4"" head. Aroma is sweetness itself, loaded with fruit and a hint of honey. Complexities abound, flavor is rich and suggestive of candies, liqeuers. Body is medium, texture is dazzling, yet delicate. Peach flavor resounds and reverberates, remaining on the palate at length. Ends a bit dryly, witha crisp and appropriate snap. Each returning sip rewards, a flash of fruit, a tart pucker, followed by a dry, rounding out that mellows and relieves. All is well and good in the world until I'm looking through an empty glass, and...""Barman, another ""Spontaneous Aviator"", please!"""
Town Hall Peach Lambic;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Suspicious in concept, only slightly better in practice. I think peach is too soft of a fruit flavor to work here. Aroma has an effervescence like cider, the peach is definitely noticeable in the flavor, slightly sour, but at least the peach in is control. Hazy, soft colors (dark in pub, but I think it was pink/grapefruit in color). I was told they brewed this a year ago and have been maturing it in casks.
Great Grains Blond Ox Beer;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;If I want vinegar, I’ll buy a bottle of vinegar at the grocery store. If I want beer, I don’t want vinegar. What you get with this is vinegar (and rotten vinegar, at that) disguised as a beer. This ox needs to be slaughtered and its tainted meat incinerated so that it cannot contaminate the rest of the beef supply.
Great Grains Blond Ox Beer;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;I agree with Lumpy that there are some vinegar strains, particularly in the aroma, but there was also a substantial caramel and fruit layer that I thought made it a passable/stomachable sipping beer. Nut brown color. The palate was low on carbonation but it had some malty smoothness. I sat with it as I watched the double-overtime NCAA second-round game between Wake Forest (#2 seed) and West Virginia (#7 seed)--a nice upset for the Mountaineers.
Great Grains Blond Ox Beer;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Bottle. A wheat? Are you sure? Ok...No head on a brown body. Holy flying vino-this isn’t beer it is malt vinegar. This tastes EXACTLY like watered down malt vinegar. Seriously. I dare you to try this swill and disagree. I think this bad boy is beyond its sell by date. Straight down the F’n drain.
Great Grains Blond Ox Beer;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Just as Andrew196 said, the head was totally insane. I poured a an inch of liquid and the entire glass filled with head. Tangerine-colored. If this is a wheat beer, the label says nothing about it. Tastes not unlike soda water with the slightest bit of flavoring added. Not wheaty. Thin.
Great Grains Blond Ox Beer;Dallas, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Very fizzy, ridiculous head! I poured about a quarter inch of beer into the pint and the head was at the top of the glass...no sludge either! Color was unfiltered orange...fizzed like a soda water. Citric hop taste, not bad, but not all that good either.

U.S. Border Red River Ale;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;U.S. Border Brewery Cantina;Dissipointing offering. While the other beers on tap that night were at least strong offerings, this one left me disapointed. It had a thick sweet malt aroma with caramel. The body wasn't too thin for the style but the flavor was boring. There just wasn't really anything to it.
U.S. Border Devils Hopyard IPA;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;IPA;U.S. Border Brewery Cantina;Nice copper colored brew with good hop aroma. Malt balances the hops though finish is slightly bitter.

Starts with mild hops and malt and finishes with a very pleasant but strong fruity hop bitterness. Now as POW as a lot of the other IPAs I've had recently. The hops have a nice meld with cilantro in the salsa.

Keesmann Weiße;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Keesmann;Tap at FOB, Rimini, Italy. Pours fairly hazy, golden, with fluffy white foam, fine. Aroma is fruity, banana, yeasty, cereal. Body is average, like carbonation. Taste is medium-high sweet. Final is average.

Keesmann Weiße;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Keesmann;(Flasche) Es hat eine hellgelbe Farbe, ist leicht trüb mit einer weißen Schaumkrone. Das Aroma ist sehr hefig, zitronig und leicht säuerlich mit einer leichen Süße im Hintergrund. Der Geschmack ist wie das Aroma, samtig und etwas weinartig im Rachenraum.
Keesmann Weiße;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei Keesmann;Misty orangish golden. Creamy collar of foam holds well. Dried pineapple, vanilla, flowers, bubblegum, lemon juice, clove, banana and some plasticlike phenolics on the nose. Fluffy and expansive carbonation. Thinnish body. Prominent puttylike yeast gives way to vibrant banana and an intrusive note of artificial vanilla taffy. Yeast soon takes on a chalkiness which, along with an emergence of acidic fruitiness, suppresses much of the ripeness and luster of the esters. Coarse acids are grating on the tongue and displace the fresher nuttiness and piecrust dimensions, leaving more of a wet baguette in its wake. Expressive clove imparts a peppery sass while a dose of airy phenols amplifies the high attenuation. Inadequate malt sugar allows the body-hindering green banana and lemon juice to run rampant. Well, the aroma here is nicely phenolic and pleasant enough, but flavorwise, specifically, it’s lacking malt heft which would help combat the unripe fruitiness. Decent overall, but not quite up to par with its Franconian peers, where high-quality weissbier isn’t that uncommon.

Burg Veluws Blond;Ermelo, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Burg Bieren;Bottle: Served in a shaker: Gusher: very big fluffy white foamy head on top of a hazy murky yellow colored beer. Aromas of grains, wheat, some glue, nail polish remover and some alcohol drenched fruit. Not an inviting aroma. Flavour is a bad mix of malts, glue, carbo gass, light bitter, dried hebs, some leaves, grains, some yeast, some wheat and card box... Aftertaste is a mix of malts, bitters, card board, some yeast and dry planty tones... Medium carbo, light watery light spice/sparkling mouthfeel, medium but weak bodied and a watery light dry sparked texture. Quite unbalanced and can’t finish the entire bottle... Not my cup of tea...

Taste is quite the same. Quite strong taste of roasted malts, bit sour yeast, vegetable again. Very weird, maybe it's because it's the smallest brewery in Holland. Initially, it's a pretty nice brew, but at the end the flavor gets a bit too strong or something, very odd.
Burg Winterbier;Ermelo, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Burg Bieren;2001 version: Bit of roasted malt and some apple in the aroma. Also roasted malt in the taste. Alcohol, apple and vinegar. Yeasty. Thin for such a strong beer. Amateuristic and disappointing. (5 3 4 2 7 2.1) 2003 version: almost opague. Sugary licorice aromna and flavor. Roasted malt, even a bit smoky. Cola. Bitter aftertaste. This beer has bettered considerably since 2001. Not great, but good enough.

Glacier Amber Ale;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Glacier Brewhouse;Tap. Pours clear Ameer, small off white head, good lacing. Aroma is very light, caramel, hint of metal, Bock notes, nutty, Noble hop. Flavor is light plus sweet, very light bitter. Medium body, soft mouthfeel.
Glacier Amber Ale;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Glacier Brewhouse;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a dark ruddy amber to brown color with a nice finger’s worth of white foamy head that dissipated at an even pace. Moderate glossy lacing. The aroma had some sweet and toasty bready to caramel malts. Mild toffee/butterscotch and then some grassy hops. The flavor keeps the malts to play with a nice sweet to toasty taste. Some nuts. Nuts, toast and caramel combine in the aftertaste and cleanly moves into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Mild carbonation. ABV felt fine. Overall, good amber ale that I could come back to if I could have again.

Not really a pilsner, but not bad."
Glacier Bohemian Pilsener;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Glacier Brewhouse;On tap @ the brewhouse. Golden in color with an average white head. Aroma of mildly spicy hops and a light bready scent. The flavor was sweet malt balanced with the bitter hops. Crisp refreshing mouth feel for this light bodied beer. Easy drinking, especially on a hot day.
Glacier Bohemian Pilsener;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Glacier Brewhouse;19-Jan-08 (Draft: Glacier Brewhouse in Anchorage, AK) I couldn’t remember if I had tried this on any of my past visits to Anchorage, so unfortunately, I ended up revisiting this one. As with my previous sample three years ago, this beer is sweet! Honey-like, bready and grainy, but very light on hop flavor and bitterness, and no spiciness. Likewise, the nose is sweet and bready. Medium in body. Without much hop character, the beer naturally lacks crispness and is neither clean nor refreshing on the palate. It is sparkling clear and golden in color with half an inch of white head that settles to a filmy layer and wide ring. Overall, like many Glacier Brewhouse beers, this one is far too sweet.24-Jul-05 (Draft: Glacier Brewhouse in Anchorage, AK) Once again, and this is my third visit, none of the darker or bigger beers on tap at Glacier Brewhouse. What gives? But at least they have a new beer for me to try. This pilsner is malty for sure, but oddly sweet, kind of a caramel or honey sweetness, I’m not sure, and it seems out of place here. Mild bitterness balances the beer in the finish. Again, the nose is malty, but I can’t seem to place the odd sweetness. Lighter body, and the finish isn’t all that crisp. Dark straw color, perfectly clear, with plenty of carbonation bubbles when first poured, though that really slacks off after a few minutes and looks still. White head pours to a half-inch in height, and though fading to a sheen, it still leaves a fairly dense curtain of lace behind. Not bad, but again, this is just your generic microbrew beer. All right, but not something I’d order again. (6, 3, 5, 3, 11 = 2.8)
Glacier Bohemian Pilsener;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Glacier Brewhouse;Upon recieving this beer, I went to take a small sniff to pick up some aroma. Thinking my nose was malfunctioning, I tried a bigger whiff. Still nothing. I took a few sniffs of air, a quick sniff of the shirt, then went in for the kill. Sniffing my beer like it was a line of cocaine, heads turned, dogs barked, glasses shattered, a new hurricane hit Florida. Turning my head towards my water, I mananged to smell more from my glacial tap water than from this beer. I still have to give it a 3 though rather than a 1 because at least it didn’t smell bad. The point being, I’ve never encountered a beer with so little aroma. On to the tasting... very pale gold, decent lacing on the poor. Taste was overall vegetably and very pilz like (maybe because they use saaz and nothing else). A tiny bit of bitterness in the aftertaste and a full, body, but really nothing great here.
Glacier Bohemian Pilsener;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Glacier Brewhouse;"From a growler, Anchorage, 7/5/05. Dark yellow and thick; sweet flower aroma that belied the unexpected doughy malt (very biscuity) character. Full-bodied with a light tartness in the finish."
Glacier Bohemian Pilsener;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Glacier Brewhouse;Orangey and slightly hazy. Malts had some curious flavors such as tree bark, grains, and earth. Maybe even a little husky as well. Had some musty, earthy yeast flavors. Hops were slightly perfumey and herbal, with a mild bitterness in the finish. Kind of light in body, but the flavors and aromas make it quite the wholesome Bohemian.
Glacier Bohemian Pilsener;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Glacier Brewhouse;Boy, what a beer! The only thing was the look was a little creamy for a pilsener. The taste, flow and lingering aftertaste was superb. Good Job!!
Suntory Jun Nama;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;Shared the can with caesar. Clear yellow coloured, practically no head. Very faint aroma, some hops perhaps. Very watery flavour, some weird hoppy flavour. Bad brew.
Suntory Jun Nama;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;Canned. A friend of mine brought this from his trip to Asia. The description on the can are in Japanese, so i’m actually guessing on this one, maybe it’s not the Jun Nama. But the only thing the can said was ’Suntory Beer’. Clear yellow color, hardly any head. Aroma of hop, bit skunky. Taste is plain bitter, not much else to say about.
Suntory Jun Nama;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;"This is called ""Jun Nama"". Typical clear and gold with a white head. a slight hop aroma but a bit of a smoldering wire scent. Like burnt dust. Sweet with a mild hop follow, rather plain."
Suntory Jun Nama;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;Can: Rather light in body and taste. Refreshing if ice cold on a scorching summer day
Suntory Jun Nama;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;Can in Kyoto, Japan. A white yellow color with minimal return. Not good...
Suntory Jun Nama;Osaka, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Suntory Liquors Limited;Tastes like a Miller Lite to me. Refreshing on a hot day when it's ice cold. Not Suntory's best but maybe their cheapest.
Hofmeister;Reading, Berkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Berkshire (Heineken UK);I wanted to just write utter filth but it told me there were few characters. But now after this short blurb I can happily say that this beer was in fact.........................utter filth.
Hofmeister;Reading, Berkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Berkshire (Heineken UK);Ahhh, fond memories of drinking this beer back in my student days before I realized what real beer was.. Even then it tasted bad!
Hofmeister;Reading, Berkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Berkshire (Heineken UK);A poor beer, that thankfully has been discontinued (I believe!). Made my friend sick on two separate occasions (he’ll never try it again).
Hofmeister;Reading, Berkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Berkshire (Heineken UK);1. Can 13/09/2003 Golden coloured and smooth with a slightly dry malt finish. 2. Can 14/09/2003 Clear golden with slightly sour fruit flavour. Dry malt finish.
Hofmeister;Reading, Berkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Berkshire (Heineken UK);Very light in colour, aroma and flavour. Quite thin and watery. Some notes of hops though. Quite good for a low alcohol lager.
Hofmeister;Reading, Berkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Berkshire (Heineken UK);An orange beer with a small head. The aroma is a slightly sour malt aroma. The flavor is sour and malty is if it has been brewed on brewing cereal. The flavor is boring and the body is thin (OK, it is only 3.2% ABV).
Hofmeister;Reading, Berkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Berkshire (Heineken UK);Anaemic yellow in colour. The aromas are...missing as are flavours. This is an absolute insult to beer. My blood is boiling (and probably tastes better). Don't follow the bear.
Hofmeister;Reading, Berkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Berkshire (Heineken UK);Keg. Pale yellow straw with white head. Thin imitation lager, lacking flavour or any positive points.
Hofmeister;Reading, Berkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Berkshire (Heineken UK);Can. Light straw yellow colour. Little or no head despite the carbonation. Thin everything and less of the other things you want in a beer.
Hofmeister;Reading, Berkshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Berkshire (Heineken UK);It really doesn't inspire me to give it any higher rating that the minimum allowed. Served cold, it's as thirst quenching as anything liquid I suppose, but if I was that thirsty, I would rather have a refreshing glass of cold water. An utter waste of space in any pub.
Holdens Summer Daze;Dudley, West Midlands, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Holdens Brewery;very clear dark yellow with a small head composed of odd size blurps of white, like adding milk to orange juice. bizarre aromas of asparagus and rotten mandarin which lead me to suspect that it wasn't in prime condition. flavourwise you get a shortlived peanutbutter blob, followed by Nothing At All, with a faint, apologetic spike of bitterness at the end like a rabbit poking its head out of a hole. a slight cheesiness pervades all (kraft singles, of course).
Highgate Saddlers Best Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);First tasted this at the Hogshead, Paisley in October 1997. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale amber in colour with a thin creamy white head. Slight malt note in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives a digestive biscuit base with a touch of caramel and tart pomegranate fruit. Hoppy resins give a dry bitterness to the short aftertaste. Slight hint of dry liquorice in the smooth malty finish. An ok session bitter.
Highgate Saddlers Best Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Cask conditioned at Cockney Pub, Århus Golden color.

Highgate Saddlers Best Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Cask Handpump at The Wellington, Birmingham (where it was selling for only £1.10/pint as they needed the pump for their forthcoming beer festival, but I tried not to let that fact affect the scores!). Amber with a short head and a perfumed scent. Caramel and bitter hops in the taste. Simple and good.

Highgate Saddlers Best Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);"Hand pulled at the City Tavern, Birmingham. Pale brown, light and airy with a fluffy head. Creamy mouthfeel generally. Reminds me of Rowntree jelly in a way; toffee light, very smooth. Pleasant session material."
Highgate Saddlers Best Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Cask Conditioned at The Bell, Banbury. Mid brownt to orange beer with fluffy head. A bit of a basic bitter, medium roasted malt, some fruit and then a boiled, not fresh bitterness. I found this to be an over processed beer for a cask, almost a carbonated bottled beer.
Highgate Special Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);[Keg at the City Tavern, Birmingham.] Amber with a thick dense cream head - caramel aroma - creamy texture but watery taste - tap water and cardboard finish.

Highgate Special Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Tasted 22/08/2006. Birthday beer with Tyrrell (followed by a particularly fresh Old 95). Packaged as Highgate Bitter and is 3%. 2L rigger/flagon/PET from Rumble’s, Wellington. Attractive copper, quite bright, with a airy off-white head that’s gone faster than it arrived. Prune and caramel on the nose - very typically English. Fizzy lightweight mouthfeel is pretty easy drinking, as you’d expect for 3%. Fairly dry flavour suggests caramel, brown sugar and a little stonefruit edge. A little light through the middle, with not much of a hop profile or bitterness. Seems a bit more like a pale mild than a bitter. Easy drinking but nothing special.
Highgate Special Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Light golden with a dense but short head. Took a long time to settle. Aroma and flavour fruity and average. Quite flat, nothing exciting on the palate.
Highgate Special Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Cask Conditioned, at The Market Porter, London.

Clean, clear bitterness with good, generous length on the palate.
Highgate Special Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Cask. Typical Birmingham bitter, sweet and not very biiter.

Highgate Special Bitter;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Draught at Hollyfields Sports and Social Club, Erdington, Birmingham. Bright amber, with a smooth, large nitro-keg head. Very toffee flavoured and refreshing. Light and easily gulpable, but the smoothness seems to work well. Sweet and enjoyable.
Josyu Forest Blessing of Venus;Takaimachi, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Shin Shin Company, Ltd.;Clear straw color with a tall white head. Decent lace. Aroma slightly spicy with definate noble hops. Sharp hops bitterness along with a nice malt backing. Finish is slightly malty with enough hops to cut through and leave you refreshed. Nice effort.
La Payenne Noire;Montbrun du Bocage, France;Stout;Ferme Brasserie du Bocage;The only one I had the chance to taste from this brewer. You have to get to the brewery if you want to purchase a beer. Stout of a dark colour (surprised ?), a fruity aroma and a good taste of rosted malt, coffee and chocolate. Palate is a little to light. I'd like to drink more often of this one...
Full Sail BikeSummerfest Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Probably is the amber. Medium brown color, medium head. A medium bodied ale. Malts are slightly roasted and somewhat sweet. Medium hopped, slightly spicy. Good balance. Nice flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer
Full Sail BikeSummerfest Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;This is a special event brew to celebrate the BikeSummer Festival, which is being held in Portland this year. This sure looks a lot like the Amber, creamy off-white head and amber coloring, with a nice malty nose. Very smooth front to back, and well balanced malt/hop flavor, but perhaps the only thing differing from the Amber is the label.

Chicago All Nighter;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Chicago Brewing Company;20th July 2014, part of a 9 glass tasting at the outlet inside the 4 Queens Casino. Not a lot going on in this clear pale coloured brew. Mild hop and light malt blended aroma. Semi-sweet with a mini-hop finish, bordering on bland.

La Binchoise Rose des Remparts;Binche, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie La Binchoise;Robe rose aux reflets bruns, mousse quasi absente. Nez sur la framboise, sur un fond acidulé. Bouche à l’attaque ronde et fruitée, bulle discrète, manque de fraîcheur et d’amertume. Une bière légèrement meilleure que la précédente mais pas qui n’a pas vraiment d’intérêt.
La Binchoise Rose des Remparts;Binche, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brasserie La Binchoise;Summer beer since 1992, seems to be a ’pils’ (standard pale lager) with added grenadine. Thin mouthfeel, unstable head, superficially sweet taste combining pale malt sweetness with sugary grenadine - and not too much else. By far the worst concoction I ever tasted from this brewery, but I do see why it has gained popularity among young consumers unaware of what actual beer tastes like.

Cambridge Wolfs Irish Red Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Cambridge Brewing Company;Cask: Aroma and flavor of this spice we sometimes put in cheese in Denmark. Can not remember the name of it, but I dislike it.

Cambridge Wolfs Irish Red Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Cambridge Brewing Company;Tap. Similar to their amber, except it looks redder, almost violet. Some burnt chocolate notes (as in the amber), but the mouthfeel was downright slimy. Yuck.
Cambridge Wolfs Irish Red Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Cambridge Brewing Company;great amber red color, fluffy white head. aroma of malt. pleasant malty taste that hasaa smoky peat character ends with a bitter hop finish. palate is overly creamy due to being pumped full of nitrogen. this would have been best had the brewers made it cask conditioned.
Butterfield San Joaquin Golden Ale;Fresno, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Butterfield Brewing Company;Bitter grapefruit aroma with a hops kick at the end. This beer had a very crisp feeling, but was not very substantial. Many Bud Lite drinkers order this beer when at the brewery.
Butterfield India Pale Ale;Fresno, California, United States;IPA;Butterfield Brewing Company;Tap @ Reno Festival. Dark golden color with a foamy white head. Citrus and grassy aroma with a hop flavor. Well balanced.
Butterfield India Pale Ale;Fresno, California, United States;IPA;Butterfield Brewing Company;"I can recognize that this beer is a great example of an American IPA. I am not a fan of this style, so I didn't really enjoy drinking it. There was a pleasant strong grapefruit aroma, but the taste was way way way too ""hoppy"" for me. Nice dark golden color."
Butterfield Irish Stout;Fresno, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Butterfield Brewing Company;A step above the Porter - slight smoky flavor - but not overpowering. Best of my visit to Butterfield.
Butterfield Irish Stout;Fresno, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Butterfield Brewing Company;Strong coffee and alcohol aroma and taste in this beer. Nice smokey flavors, but the alcohol taste kept interrupting. I was surprised because the ABV is not that high. Otherwise this heavy-bodied opaque black beer was worth trying.
Butterfield Hefeweizen;Fresno, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Butterfield Brewing Company;My favorite of Butterfield's beers. The color is a very pale hazy yellow. The aroma is sweet/banana/citrus, with a matching taste. The small bubbles filled the beer which left a crisp, refreshing feeling in my mouth.

Dark, clear amber pour with a finger of head that is mostly diminishing. Aromas of caramel, malt, and dough.

Twisted Pine Red Mountain Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Twisted Pine Brewing;12oz bottle pours clear deep ruby red with thin mocha head. The aroma has a pretty bold mix of sweet nuttiness, sweet dark fruity esters and some mildly rich maltiness. The taste comes to the plate with some roasted malts, nuttiness and sweet dark fruity esters mingling around one another. To midway a moderate level of spicy anise and chocolate malts murmur up and join in. Nice bold notes throughout that do their best to pull together but don’t get all the way there.

Twisted Pine Red Mountain Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Twisted Pine Brewing;Enjoyed on tap a the brewery’s tasting room. Left this to put out the fire from the chiles and bourbon, being a malt combination, but it seemed astringent a bit in its own right. Dark colour, drinkable, but nothing to write home about. Want a more complex and rich malt profile.

Twisted Pine Red Mountain Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Twisted Pine Brewing;12oz bottle. A little too much amber malt character to make me think Scottish Ale, this is pretty much an Amber or Red. Smooth, medium bodied, pretty clean and drinkable. Some vanilla-amber malt tastes, sugary and sweet. Easy drinking, OK.
Butterfield Bavarian Weisse;Fresno, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Butterfield Brewing Company;Dark golden-brown color. This beer had a very sweet banana aroma and taste with a nice malt flavor. The body was light considering it's dark color.

Hugos Hefeweizen;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hugos;Cloudy gold colour. Sweet banana aroma. Refreshing, wheaty body. Light banana flavour. It’s a bit light...overattenuated...but ends up sweet anyway, spritzy and with a bit of lime in the finish. Quite nice, I thought.
Hugos Hefeweizen;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hugos;At Hugos. Banana aroma. Vry cloudy yellow, nice pearling carbonation, low head. Light bodied - lacks distinction and chewyness. Candyish and somewhat flowery. At first I thought it was because it was served too cold, but even when it warms up it is far too lightfooted for my taste.
Hugos Hefeweizen;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hugos;Draft at the brewery Cloudy deep glowing yellow color. Flavor is a little hot alcohol, some coriander and more honey than I prefer. Spicy Belgian-like yeast, toasty and fluffy. Sweet lemons abound in the nose, and it’s a little weedy at times, with an unpleasent vegetable smell.
Hugos Hefeweizen;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hugos;Cloudy orange in appearance with a yeasty very banana aroma. Flavour is tons of banana with some citrus and a bit of spice, lots of flavour in this Hefeweizen. Bit of a fruity aftertaste with of course more banana.

Buckerfields Judge Begbies Dark Lager;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Swans Brewpub;Mahogany colored stalwart looking lager. This lager much more of a roasted aroma and taste than I expected. It was far more robust than other dark lagers I have sampled, but was solid just the same.

Twisted Pine Northstar Imperial Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter - Imperial;Twisted Pine Brewing;Une mousse kaki flotte sur un liquide complètement noir. Les parfums de cette concoction prennent quelques minutes pour se dévoiler. Café, fruits et cacao forment un trio solide. Les saveurs me plaisent bien. Le chocolat est concentré tandis que le café a un goût fruité. En bouche, j’apprécie le corps huileux et le doux pétillement. En finale, le chocolat laisse au fond de ma gorge une amertume et quelques notes vanillées. Une proposition intéressante et assez facile à boire.

Mild nose of blackberry, cookie dough and apple. Taste is a smooth blend of graham cracker, slightly tart blackberry, prune, caramel and dry cocoa.

Zeppelin;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"Van Steenberge version, tasted at ’t Waagstuk, one of the few places which serve this; apparently commemorates a bombardment of the Antwerp Stadswaag in the first World War. Thin but stable, creamy head; very dark ruby red colour. Caramelly aroma and taste, a bit nutty, some chocolate, marzipan, estery fruitiness, light coffee-like roasted bitterishness in the finish along with some rather unpleasant, but fortunately not too strong solvents."
Zeppelin;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Version by De Proef . Yet this is not a vintage ... ( best before 21-11-15 ) . Is this a new batch, by the proef again , or has it only changed this recently ??? Anyway . Pours clear , dark red/brown . Good white foam . Scent is metallic , dark and red fruits , bit sweet, bit bitter ( if you concentrate enough ) Taste is metallic, bitter, burnt malts ( burnt taste in general, which is not a nice thing , like burnt malts in an IMP stout . This tastes like actual burnt stuff ) . Way less fruity than the scent gives away, yet some aspects are there . A very small, almost sour touch . Not bad, per se , but a bit weird and not completely working . Pretty sure it’s not infection though . Too much gas . Doesn’t really work for me .

Titletown Dunkelweizen;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Titletown Brewing Company;"Opaque light brown; no head to speak of. Caramelly-sweet at first, wheat character only comes out in the nose and flavor as it warms. Little bitterness on the end, very smooth."
Titletown Dusseldorfer Altbier;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Titletown Brewing Company;A very good beer from the regular tap, and even better in the cask-conditioned version that has recently been available at Titletown's upstairs bar. Any beer aficionado who visits Green Bay should not miss visiting the 2nd floor at T-Town and checking out whatever brew is available on the hand-pull.
Titletown Dusseldorfer Altbier;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Titletown Brewing Company;"Very clear, dark-cider appearance. Caramel/butterscotch dominates, very malty but just enough bitterness and verve to cut through the sweetness and keep it from cloying; good body. One of Titletown's best."

New Holland Raspberry Porter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;Pours dark withslight head. Strong chocolate and sweet rasberry nose. Absolutely one of the best combinations of fruit and beer. This was like a wonderful dessert. Had this at MI Summer Festival. Would love to see NH bottle this. Fine, fine beer
New Holland Raspberry Porter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;"Quoth Jacob, ""I didn't hold back with the fruit,"" and man, that is one thing for sure! This thing is a wild marriage of rasberry and chocolate - a distinctly better fruit brew than most I've tried, but a decidedly dessert beer. As I'm not partial to that kind of thing, it doesn't get my highest marks, but I can see how this could become a cult fave."
New Holland Raspberry Porter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;Sweet raspberry aroma, with cofee undertones. Flavour is fruity sweet with a chocolate middle and a swet raspberry finish. It's good, but they need to tone down the razz and up the roast stout flavour.
New Holland Raspberry Porter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;toasty aroma with lots of raz. lingering coffee, some coco in the middle. its all pretty subtle except for the raz.
La Barberie Blonde Biologique;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Couleur jaune pâle. Trouble, avec un léger collet.

Point positif elle est bio!!!
La Barberie Blonde Biologique;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Bouteille 500 ml au restaurant La coureuse des grèves (saint-Jean-Port-Joli). Robe jaunâtre surmontée d’un collet blanc. Arôme de grains et de fruits. Moins désagréable que dans mon souvenir (peut-être le produit s’est-il amélioré?). Déception au goût cependant. Mince en bouche. Rafraichissante, sans plus.
La Barberie Blonde Biologique;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Bottle (500 ml). Shared by Yann, thanks! Clear yellow with a small white head and no lacing. Aroma is skunky and green with herbal notes and malt. Taste is skunky with herbal notes, cereals and fainted hops. Light to medium body. Watery. Weak. This one is more boring than bad, but there’s definitely something off in both the aroma and taste. Still drinkable, but not far from a drain pour.
La Barberie Blonde Biologique;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Pours a light yellow with a low white head that leaves some lacing. Aroma is vegetal and skunky. Taste is lightly malty and that’s about it. Not really tasty. Body is light, mouthfeel is watery. Bof...
La Barberie Blonde Biologique;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Une blonde très quelconque. Une couleur jaune générique, un léger col de mousse blanche, un petit nez de houblon, une entrée citronnée qui s’évanouit vers un néant assez notoire pour un produit Barberie. Ça se boit bien, c’est agréable... mais à ce prix-là, on se demande si on ne devrait pas aller vers des produits plus générique à meilleur prix...

La Barberie Blonde Biologique;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Bière d’un blonc pâle, translucide, dans laquelle la lie danse quelques secondes avant de retourner se reposer au fond : beaucoup de lie ! (j’ai malencontreusement laissée la bouteille à l’horizontale un peu avant de l’ouvrir.) Nez assez banal de houblons floraux, légèrement citronné. En bouche, je dois dire que je suis très déçu. Peu de goût. Très banal. Cela est correct, mais c’est simplement sec, franc, comme une Labatt 50... Disons que le prix plus élevé fait en sorte que cette bière est à éviter, sauf si vous avez de l’argent à gaspiller inutilement. Grande déception...
La Barberie Blonde Biologique;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Pour une blonde de micro-brasserie, elle est étonnamment neutre. Peu de saveurs, on relève un peu de fruité au nez et en bouche, fin de l’histoire. Sans être mauvaise (en fait, loin de là), elle manque de caractère et d’originalité, et on se demande si elle ne se différencie de ses sous-compétitrices de Molson et Labatt que par son étiquette bio­. Peut faire partie d’une entrée en matière pour les débutants en bières de micro.

The aroma is doughy with some hops. The appearance is deep gold with an amber hue and almost no head or carbonation. The flavor is very bagel like with cardboard and an astringent bitterness. The palate is thin with a metallic aftertaste. I really wish I could have had one fresh, it’s a pity that it’s retired.
Bagel Beer Plain Pilsner;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;Purchased at Cock and Bull Pub in Sarasota about 9 months ago, drank a few days later. It was past date for sure, but held up surprisingly well for a pilsner. Clear gold with a small off white head. Grainy, bready, earthy, a little bit of skunk. Noticed some definite bagel, actually. Balanced, light body, easy drinking.
Bagel Beer Plain Pilsner;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;Poured a medium, light hazy, golden color with virtually no had at all. Aromas of light citrus and light caramel. Tastes of the same. Bread in the aromas and tastes as well (I guess this is the bagel influence). Medium sweet. Not sure why the bottle has this labeled as a pilsner (it tasted nothing like one). Not sure what possessed me to buy this one (must be the gimmick of being brewed with real plain bagels - it worked on me).
Bagel Beer Plain Pilsner;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;Grainy-malty aroma. Lousy label on the 22 oz bomber. Toasted malt, red lager with some syrupy notes, not hoppy. I wouldn’t have categorized this as a pils at all -- more an American dark or a red lager. Medium body, with a somewhat unpleasant cling. Patchouli smell to the bottle.
Bagel Beer Plain Pilsner;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;"Light, yet clumpy white head with bubbly lacing. Light golden pour with a little bit of bubble action. Cheap clip-art looking label. Fresh, fruity aroma, slight whiff of nectarines. Full-bodied flavor with some sweet honey notes in the background. Slight taste of white grapes as well. Stays strong throughout the 22 oz bomber. Like the other ""bagel"" beers by this brewer I can’t detect any bagel flavor. Overall decent for a beer found in a health food store."
Bagel Beer Plain Pilsner;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, fully diminishing. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (grain, bread), lightly hoppy (flowers, grapefruit). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.
Bagel Beer Plain Pilsner;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;Bottle. Golden color with a foamy off-white head. A bread and dough aroma with a light malt. Medium body, dry, bread, not good. A bagel in the beer is a mistake.
Bagel Beer Plain Pilsner;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;Good body, low-to-moderate carbonation, full flavor, dry finish. I was impressed.
Bagel Beer Plain Pilsner;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;Good pilsner. Very easy to drink. good blend of the light low bitterness hops with malt that is not sweet or bready. nothing jumps out as special here but it is worth the time.
Bagel Beer Plain Pilsner;Gilroy, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Coast Range Brewing Company;It's a pretty decent beer as far as pilseners go. I tried but did not notice the bagel in it, maybe a little on the finish but otherwise a standard beer.
Bagel Beer Pumpernickel Porter;Gilroy, California, United States;Porter;Coast Range Brewing Company;Huge thanks to Joey for hooking me up with this a long time ago. Just getting around to popping it. This is a damn fine porter. Pours a rich and creamy brownish color with a deep purple hue. So dark that light does not penetrate it. Light head, with lots of moving bubbles. Aroma is nice, chocolate and rye bread. Flavor has both chocolate and rye, but much more: hints of toast, raisins, roasted malt, and even milk. Great balance on everything. Palate is exceptional, very rich and creamy. This beer is vastly underrated, and one of the best porter I have drank.
Bagel Beer Pumpernickel Porter;Gilroy, California, United States;Porter;Coast Range Brewing Company;Bomber, thanks to IBrew2or3! Pours a translucent dark brown with a lacy tan head. Sweet malty aroma with a touch of molasses. Medium-light body and medium carbonation. Lightly sweet roasty chocolate taste that eases into a bittersweet chocolate finish.
Bagel Beer Pumpernickel Porter;Gilroy, California, United States;Porter;Coast Range Brewing Company;This beer pours deep dark brown with lasting tan foam ring. The aroma is roasty and toasty with sweet dark fruity esters of prunes, dates and mild raisins. There is a faint burnt malt aroma hidden in there somewhere. The flavor has big yet smooth burnt maltiness. Then mild dark fruitiness joins in with prunes and dates. As the finish approaches the roasty malts increase in intensity along with a mild malt astringency. This retired beer has aged beautifully.
Bagel Beer Pumpernickel Porter;Gilroy, California, United States;Porter;Coast Range Brewing Company;22--wow, thanks IBrew2or3! Fantastic opportunity to taste a retired delight. Deep opaque mahogany with caramel highlights. Thin but relatively dense grayish head. Huge malty brown bread toasty nose. Nice medium body with soft carb. Light roast and very light bittersweet chocolate on the mid-palate. Long chocolatey finish.
Bagel Beer Pumpernickel Porter;Gilroy, California, United States;Porter;Coast Range Brewing Company;Poured a very dark brown to black color with a medium sized tan head. The aroma was sweet and roasty with milk chocolate and soy notes. The aroma was thick. The flavor was smooth and roasty. Semi-sweet with mild chocolate notes. Mildly bitter and semi-dry. Light side of a medium body.
Bagel Beer Pumpernickel Porter;Gilroy, California, United States;Porter;Coast Range Brewing Company;The aroma is quite lactic with heavily toasted malt, chocolate, and brown sugar. I’m not really feeling much pumpernickel here maybe a little rye. The appearance is dark brown with a tiny head. The flavor is acidic with all the elements from the aroma plus a tiny bit of pumpernickel but not nearly enough. The palate is thin with a bitter aftertaste. I am not in love with this beer but it’s an interesting novelty beer.
Bagel Beer Pumpernickel Porter;Gilroy, California, United States;Porter;Coast Range Brewing Company;Bottle shared with HogTownHarry & biegaman -- courtesy of HogTownHarry. Labelled ’Coast Range Bagel Beer Pumpernickel Porter’. Pours a very dark ruby-brown with a small diminishing creamy tan head. Aroma is roasty and yeah, you can smell toasted bagels along with nuts and cocoa -- nice! Flavour of roasted malt, coffee, light hops and some chocolate. Light to medium bodied. This is really good, it’s original and very easy to drink.
Bagel Beer Pumpernickel Porter;Gilroy, California, United States;Porter;Coast Range Brewing Company;Bottle (650ml). Shared with blankboy and biegaman, via trade with Degarth. Deep burnt mahogany colour, slightly hazy, average frothy off-white head. Nutty, carbonized malt aroma, like burnt toast with marmite on it, some bitter rye-like acidity in the finish. The taste is very roasty, baker’s chocolate bitterness seems to dominate for me, a little herbal grain character but not much alcohol presence at all - for something this malty, it has quite a bitter finish. Barely average body, slick, still and lightly astringent/acidic - not a long finish, not much aftertaste, just a unique, tasty and drinkable porter.
Bagel Beer Pumpernickel Porter;Gilroy, California, United States;Porter;Coast Range Brewing Company;Bottle from Degarth. This is a very interesting beer, and the closest to a kvass I’ve yet had. Aroma is light malted chocolate, lactic sweetness and a touch of roast. A bit of pumpernickel in the flavor complements some of the lactic component. Not really noticing any rye, but it is indeed bready. A solid beer, for sure.
Bagel Beer Pumpernickel Porter;Gilroy, California, United States;Porter;Coast Range Brewing Company;Pours midnight brown w/ a shallow, semi creamy froth that dissapears quickly. Aromas of roasted cocoa fill the air. Very nice! Medium nectar w/ residual effers that create a hard-water texture. Big roasty flavors w/ plenty of cocoa. Slight bagelesque nuance is quickly forgotten amidst this robust foreground. The finish is bittered perfectly. Not so dry and very enjoyable.
Northwest Brewwerks Hop Heaven IPA;Kirkland, Washington, United States;IPA;Northwest Brewwerks;This is northwest three skulls IPA. Bitter and hoppy. Good floral and citrus notes. Fluffy white head. Earthy grassy taste. Not bad
Northwest Brewwerks Hop Heaven IPA;Kirkland, Washington, United States;IPA;Northwest Brewwerks;Hoppy aroma, dark colored for an IPA - carmel. Bitter taste and finish not much favor, no noticeable malt sweetness. Average IPA.
Northwest Brewwerks Hop Heaven IPA;Kirkland, Washington, United States;IPA;Northwest Brewwerks;"Very nice aroma of rich hops and sweet fruitiness...Color a very pretty copper-red with moderate head---drizzly lace...Very full and well-rounded hop flavor leads the way, with light but steady sweet malt foundation that lends good anchorage to the body as well...finish is very pleasant reprise of the initial hop statement...This is hoppy and assertive enough to satisfy hop-heads, but without the sharp edges...a very good, ""civilized"" Northwest IPA."
Northwest Brewwerks Hop Heaven IPA;Kirkland, Washington, United States;IPA;Northwest Brewwerks;Very thick beer. Great hop flavor, head went quick, a true example of NW IPA.
Northwest Brewwerks Hop Heaven IPA;Kirkland, Washington, United States;IPA;Northwest Brewwerks;"Orange-amber with head pouring a tad too thick. True to its name, the aroma of this beer screamed ""hop heaven!"" The flavor had a nice hoppiness as well with a tangy edge. While there is a big taste up front, it fizzles somewhat and must be renewed with each sip. Surprisingly refined bitterness--a great Pacific Nortwest IPA and one of the best out there."
Angelic Trident Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Angelic Brewing Company;Cloudy gold with creamy edges yet clear of foam on the top. Nice banana smell but rudely interjected with an aroma of starch spray and water softener. Creamy palate feel. Heavy citric acidity up front, calmed by vanilla, cloves and crackled white pepper. Thinning finish with a touch of harshness and cornmeal.
Angelic Trident Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Angelic Brewing Company;Yellow color with off-white head. Fruit smell but, I didn’t pick anything any certain fruit. Good alcohol content but, covered by the smooth body.
Angelic Trident Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Angelic Brewing Company;Golden color with a smallish off white head. Aromas of bananas overpower the hints of malt and other fruit. Lots of alcohol and banana agian in the flavor. Additional tutti fruiti flavors. Seems more like a strong ale than a triple.
Angelic Trident Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Angelic Brewing Company;The most impressive beer of the sampler I had at Angelic on my 21st. A successful effort of duplicating the Belgian style. Definite alcoholic aroma, but well disguised in the rich amber body with a great candi sugar sweetness.
Angelic Trident Tripel;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Angelic Brewing Company;"Clear apple juice appearance, large but quick-dying head. Yeasty aroma with dates and nuts present; flavor very sweet and yeasty, thick body and low carbonation for a trippel; reasonably lasting/smooth finish. Pretty good attempt by this so-so brewpub."
Breaker Super Brew;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);Can from Best One, opposite Rochdale Train Station. Golden with a small frothy head. Strong tasting with a palatable crispness, but nothing significant in the taste department.
Breaker Super Brew;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);"75cl bottle. Just slightly hazy yellow liquid with small head. Nose : light aromas of malt and some orange/lemon background. Little honey. Sip ; low density with water texture. Strong bubbly carbonation like a soda. Sweet with fruity background, little dry on the end. Covers well the alcohol. Overall it’s quite all right. no less no more."
Breaker Super Brew;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);The Dogs! Best tasting superbrew I`ve had, far far better than that carlsberg muck. Can`t go wrong at 99p a can!
Breaker Super Brew;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);Brewed at the Coors brewery at Burton upon trent this is obviosly aimed at the `lets get smashed as quickly as possible market. Not quite as bad as I expected it is nevertheless a pretty poor beer whose sole aim in life is to pump as much alcohol as possible into someones mouth.The founders of the great breweries in Burton must be turning in their grave.
Breaker Super Brew;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);Can. Golden colour, poor head and slight over condition. Lemon zestiness initially in the nose soon overtaken by grain and alcohol. Sipping reveals some delicate maltiness, but get a good (?) mouthfull and its liquid peardrops laced with aftershave. Tingly headnumbing alcohol attack in the finish.
Breaker Super Brew;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);Nice rocky head but minimal aroma. Tastes like stale homebrew...with added sugar. No finish, which is surprising for a 9% brew. Hobo juice.

Fisser Ne Flierefluiter Westelse Tripel;Zammel, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Fisser;Rating from memory, this classic I drank a bunch of times at De Paas. Pours golden with white head, has typical Belgian yeast taste profile on top of grainy and light citrusy aroma. Just a very average tripel basically. Can hardly believe I have not rated this before.

Drank on 13/05/2018 in de Garre, Brugge.Amber body, white crown and on the sweet side. Yeasty aroma and initial taste, malts come into play mid-sip, some light fruity notes also. Interesting and different to most Abbey Tripel's I have had before.
Fisser Ne Flierefluiter Westelse Tripel;Zammel, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Fisser;"At 't Poatersgat, Bruges. Pours hazy golden with a big, frothy, white head that leaves some lacing. The aroma contains grain, malt, apple, cow fodder, barley and yeast. It tastes light malty sweet and light to medium hoppy/yeasty bitter; grainy, dry finish with lingering yeast. Medium body, slick texture, soft carbonation. Too grainy, yeasty... unconvincing."

Fisser Ne Flierefluiter Westelse Tripel;Zammel, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Fisser;Triple de 8,5 %, établie selon une vieille recette campinoise. Mon exemplaire était à 13 mois de sa date, pour 3 ans de validité préconisés. Couleur doré moyen, à la clarté brillante, mais avec de la matière en suspension malgré une carbonation correcte. Bulles fines, surtout en fontaine centrale, très nombreuses et vives. Mousse blanc cassé, épaisse, avec des cratères en haut, stable à 4 mm. Arômes de pain bis, blé, pointe de girofle, genièvre. 1ère bouche soyeuse à veloutée, à la belle entame malt/houblon/baies. Arrière-bouche dense, forte, longue, précise. 2ème à la remarquable texture, sur un bel ensemble, mais avec un petit déséquilibre dû à la présence des baies. Arrière-bouche avec une pointe d’acidité, qui confirme la bouche. 3ème qui reprend un très bon cap. Arrière-bouche avec des baies, écorce de bouleau, pointe d’acide. Longueur agréable, mais avec un fléchissement net de l’intensité. Jambes fines, longues, collantes en haut. Levure d’une ligne correcte, mais un peu faible. Alcool bien, il fait des efforts malis ne peut éviter la chute sur la longueur. Finale assez basique. CONCLUSION : cette bière avait quelques points valables à exploiter, mais n’a pas réussi à le faire. (5/2/4/3/7)

Maybe bad lines, maybe a bad batch? I shall have to try again and re-rate at a later date.

Frankenthaler Hefeweizen;Frankenthal, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Frankenthaler Brauhaus (Eichbaum);cheap hefeweizen. too much taste of alcohol and very little evidence of fruit. if other wheat beer taste like weetbix and banana in vanilla milk, this one just tastes of weetbix

Calenberger Altmarkt Pilsener;Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Gilde Brauerei (TCB Beverages);chunderously, chemically malty. i guess they just forgot to add the hops or maybe it was the hops guy's day off. i think i must have drunk more bad canned german beer than anyone else here. not that i'm bragging
Spar Bier;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria-St.Pauli-Brauerei (Carlsberg);a lot better than most budget brews. feinherbes indeed - enough hops to make it palatable and you can be pretty sure it's fresh

DuClaw Misfit Red;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;DuClaw Brewing Company;"A steady pour creates a amber tinged, tan colored head that sits on top of a concentrated amber, brown beer; when held up to the light the beer shows clear, and a deep amber hue.

There is a metallic, crystal malt flavor to the beer as well, especially in the finish. The beer is lightly sweet with a caramelized grain flavor, it has a light nuttiness to it and it has some hints of citrusy hop character. The beer finishes sort of flat and lifeless somehow.

DuClaw Kangaroo Love;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DuClaw Brewing Company;Location: Draft at the Fells Point Brew Pub, 9/6/09 Aroma: Typical corn, yeast lager aroma, just a touch of citrus Appearance: Really clear, pale yellow color Flavor: More of the same, corn, yeast, malts, barely a touch of hops Palate: Light body, somewhat watery Overall Impression: This is not the most exciting beer, for its boring appearance to its dull taste, they didn’t do much here to differentiate this beer from your typical boring lager. Maybe a good starter Craft for Macro beer fans? That’s the closest to a compliment I can think of for this one.
DuClaw Kangaroo Love;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DuClaw Brewing Company;Clear gold pour with lively carbonation. Corn aroma and flavor. Nice balance and refreshing, but something I probably wont try again.
DuClaw Kangaroo Love;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DuClaw Brewing Company;Draft at Bowie location. Came to the table a clear straw color with a skim of a tan head. Crisp aroma of corn along with a touch of citrus. Goes down very thin, light, and crisp. Some sweet maltiness upfront, but the taste is pretty much just dominated by corn throughout. A hint of citrus at the end. At least it smells and tastes fresh and clean.

Wow, maybe I got a lesser batch than the earlier raters - and my experience sure doesn't match the description at all! Maybe the server mixed up my sampler set as well... Anyway, what I drank as the Patriot Pale Ale was clear and yellow with little to no head. Aroma was faint at best, slightly hoppy but otherwise remarkable by its absence. Tasted more like a mass-produced lager than a pale ale, better as it warmed but still little real flavor. Watery mouthfeel with very light carbonation.

Full Sail Capsize Imperial Pilsner;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Full Sail Brewing Company;21st May 2018 Three Johns. Keg. Almost clear gold beer, small pale cream colour head. Smooth palate still has decent fine minerally carbonation. Sweet malts. Touch of bubblegum esters. Very sweet candy fruits underneath.

Full Sail Capsize Imperial Pilsner;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Full Sail Brewing Company;"Pours clear solar yellow with a thick and fairly persistent porcelain head. Aroma delivers crisp pear and fresh malt tones plus a hint of hops. Flavor continues the aroma while taking everything, especially the hops, up a notch. Normally I don’t think of pilsners - even Imperial ones - as bold, but this one is! Mouthfeel presents decent body and jazzy fizz. Capsize a glass - but if you get ""capsized,"" please call a ride."
Full Sail Capsize Imperial Pilsner;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Full Sail Brewing Company;Poured into a pilsener glass, the appearance was a hazy golden/yellow color with a fluffy white two fingered head that died off at a good pace. Stringy lacing. The aroma gave way to some citrus pith, floral qualities, and some earthy to grassy tones. The flavor had a fully crisp bitter hoppy taste pulling the citrus to the fresh leafiness and a touch of floral to resiny bitterness. Smooth balanced crisp sweet aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to almost medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation. Appropriate feeling ABV.

Grainy lager aroma erupts into a nice sharp taste, faint hoppy bite at the back end. Creamy, velvety smooth. Closer to a lager than a pils, but well done, so it doesn’t mstter.

Eylenbosch Gueuze;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);75cl bottle at Grote Dorst. 1988 vintage. It pours a clean rich golden color with a minimal bubbly white head. Aroma is funky and moldy, musty with strong basement and oxidation notes, some caramel sweetness and earthy tones. Taste is also moderately sweet upfront with clear signs of oxidation, caramel, basement mold, musty funk and light lemon. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Overall, nice to try a beer as old as myself
Eylenbosch Gueuze;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);75cl Bottle shared at DHVL. Clear amber with a small off white bubbly ring head. Aroma of big mouldy notes really showing the age, oxidization, caramel, apple, blue cheese, light band aid and light citric notes. Flavour is light to moderate sweet and sour. Light medium bodied with very soft carbonation. Intense.
Eylenbosch Gueuze;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Bottle at EPB1. Been a long time though. But since I’m not gonna encounter this again... APPEARANCE: clear blond beer, surprisingly still a small whitehead. NOSE: quite some horseblanket, quite fruity. TASTE: bit sweet, quite sour as well though. Not the geuze we know nowadays, but aged quite well!
Eylenbosch Gueuze;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);So, there’s a long time want ! Apparently - to set all dicussions to an end - there are 2 variations on this 1 entry. Eylenbosch made a sweetened geuze ( I hear that one is pretty bad ) , but they also made an Oude geuze ( unsweetened ) of course, without (proper) labels, there’s no way to tell if the owner doesnt know. Anyhow, at groote dorst (where this bottle was consumed ) the 1984 vintage 75 cl is the real deal and almost gone, while the bigger lasting stock of 37,5 cl is the sweetened geuze. This rating belongs for the 1984 vintage, 75 cl bottle of unsweetened geuze. Pours clear , good white head. Smell is bit bitter and earthy. Taste is pretty damn sour, still, for a 31 y old beer ! only slightly dusty which dissapeared by letting the beer breath. To the dry side, with some funk present. Maderia-like oxidation is extremely hidden, in contradiction to other beers I’ve had, not remotely this old. Great carbonation and MF, this baby did not water down. Very nice ! Glad I did ignore the comments about this being bad, and asked for the real deal !
Eylenbosch Gueuze;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Taste of the 1984 Oude Gueuze vintage thanks to kraddel. Aroma is sherry, honey, dried stone fruits, hint of funk. Light bodied, tart on the palate, dry finish. Taste is sour stone fruits, sherry, hint of honey.

Cherry red leaning towards amber with little in the way of a head. Nose is cherry skins, musty tones, damp wood, cherry stones, spice, funk. Taste comprises cherry drops, light oxidised streak, herbal, wood must, stale Bakewell tart, funk, dry rot. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, drying close with a light puckering ripple. Ok stuff.
Eylenbosch Kriek;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);1980’s bottle shared at RBSG. Thanks! The beer is a clear brown with a beige head of foam. Can’t believe it’s still carbonated! Sweet and fruity aroma. Some raisin and brown sugar notes. Medium body and lighter carbonation.
Eylenbosch Kriek;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Sampled at the RBSG Grand Tasting thanks to Bobby. I was told this bottle was from the 1980s. In my tasting glass was red in color with some pinkish foam. Nose is cherry. Medium body and good carbonation for a beer that old. Flavor very rich cherry. Very fruity finish. Tastes really good. Amazing a beer had held up this well.
Eylenbosch Kriek;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Pouring at the RBSG17 Grand Tasting. Pours a clear brown, no head. Big and oxidized. Old cough drops.

Eylenbosch Gueuze Festival;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Bottle, vintage 1980. Damaged cork. Light hazy deep brown liquid with minimal white head. Aroma of raw sugar, raisins, acetic acid, cork, butter, green apple and earth. Taste is dry and medium sour with notes of acetone, raisins, vinegar and butter. Medium bodied with no carbonation. Horrible, oxidized and flat.
Eylenbosch Gueuze Festival;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Best guess is early 80s as the label doesn’t have the bottle dating code bar as seen in the photo in this listing. I’ve heard mixed things about whether Festival was always a filtered gueuze, but given the complexity here, it comes across as though it was unfiltered. Dark golden orange body, just a thin layer of bubbles upon pouring. Super woody and musty nose with wet wood, springtime barn notes, earth, citrus, and moderate oxidation (nothing like a ton of older gueuzes that I’ve had the opportunity to have 50s Hanssens, 70s Eyelenbosch, 80s De Neve, etc). Medium bodied, gentle carbonation, lively acidity and tartness, lingering earthy/woody finish. Damn cool to try.
Eylenbosch Gueuze Festival;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Pre 84 Bottle, generously shared by Ryan. pours soft gold orange with no head. Aromas and flavors are as dusty as you can get with some earth honey, wet cedar, lemons, christmas, light barn, vtg piano and all kinds of complex woodiness. What a cool treat to try, thanks meh.

Eylenbosch Gueuze Festival;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);75 cl. bottle sampled @ Kraddel does 1K tasting. Procured by Kraddel. Cheers. Unknown Vintage – no indication of date on the bottle. Looks quite old – 1980s origin maybe? Cork is completely rotten through, blackened, crumbling apart entirely. Some filthy gunk on the bottle. I thought that all of the Eylenbosch beers were sweetened and pasteurized but this tasted like the real deal, wonderful surprise. Decanted the bottle – ridiculously murky overripe peach amber with a creamy white head. Surprised how much great carb. here. Nose is wow, so sour, incredible surprise, I am even getting acetone in the nose, big tart, vinegar, lots of fruits, musty,… Taste is big sourness, peaches, orange peel, vinegar, toffee, tart, light herbs, touch bitter herbs, lots of musty cellar in the best way imaginable, citrus, bitter barn, some citrus burn in the back of the throat. Thick very creamy body. Wonderful – wowza. This is a incredible geuze and beer. Far better than Sélection Lambic.
Eylenbosch Gueuze Festival;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);EPIC ! at my 1000th review tasting ! FUCKED UP CORK i pulled it out for 90 % ( in 15 pieces ) the rest kept stuck , with a hole in the middle wich we poured trough. it looked discusting. how old is this , even ? no sign of bottledate, anywhere.... looks orange, smells very sour. tastes very sour as well, combined with apples, and that ’dusty’ element ( this is at least 20 years old, so ... ) dont know what happened to the previous rated bottles ( were they even more fucked up ? ) cause this one was PHENOMENAL !
Eylenbosch Gueuze Festival;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Sampled at Clockwork’s 4K/5K/10K gathering 2013. Bottle pours a deep, hazy amber body with no head or lacing. Aroma is peach, light spice and faint weird cheese.

Eylenbosch Frater Ambrosius;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Sampled purchased from Kraddel. Thanks! 750 ml. bottle sampled. Bottle from 1970s – 1980s. Dark fox red, head quickly gone. Nose is dominated too much by mold, cellar, rotting cork ditch water, lemon,… Luckily you can ignore it,… Cellar & rotting cork are less present in taste , low ditch water, moldy lemon, fruity is largely lemon-like, faint vinegar, rather watery, fruit is low & vague,… Overal better than expected, it is a bit too watery, weak moldy lemon tasting, cellar, moldy corn has crept into it. Definetly too old, better than expected, there is still mild lambiek notes etc. in this one. Given that this was presumably finished, its surprisingly lambiek-like even if watery, moldy lemon etc. definitely worth more attention than their Kriek of Framboise.
Eylenbosch Frater Ambrosius;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Expected 70-80’s bottle. perfect label, so i guess stores pretty good. pours unclear peachy orange.

Eylenbosch Frater Ambrosius;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);"75cl at a secret spot, hidden deep in Flanders ;). Aroma and flavour is stunningly good. Pours amber with a lasting head. Smells like bliss : fruits, cherry, plums, grapes. Taste is wonderfully balanced; fruity, viscose sugary, although aged for 10 years this is even better than a more recent batch! Very delicate tone. Full bodied raspberry, old malts, evanescent.. Wonderful, what a rare discovery!"
Eylenbosch Frater Ambrosius;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Big thanks to tquest for that one! Bottle looks interesting. Not easy to open. Finally have the beer in the glass. Looks brownish, almost no head. Mild-sourish aroma. Starts mild, modest sourish, quite fruity like peaches and apricot. Finish less sourish, almost a bit sweet. Mild-sourish aftertaste, a bit moldy. Interesting!

Eylenbosch Frater Ambrosius;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Vintage bottle (believed circa 1986), consumed at GBBF, day 5 on 5 August 2006. Poured with a small head - some condition left. Plenty of fruit hanging on in there too. Sweetish and slightly tart. There are some oxidised papery/cardboard notes but it’s not held up too badly. Quite pleasant actually.
Eylenbosch Frater Ambrosius;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);A 1989 bottle at Heeren van Liedekercke, Denderleeuw, Belgium Hazy, amber body. Off-white fizzy head. Ok lace. Ok head after all those years. Aroma of liquor, raspberries, some tanines, a lot of white port and higher alcohols. Quite sweet aroma with some complexity. Doesn’t remind me of lambic anymore. Fruity, quite sweet flavour. Quite flat carbonation and a little bit watery. Not so intense, nor very complex. Still it is quite ok after about 20 years.
Eylenbosch Frater Ambrosius;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);A Mes rate: Another 1989 bottle from DHVL. Looks very much like a dark gueuze, pretty much no red at all. Nose is almost toasted but I guess that is mainly a sign of age. Also apparent is caramel, brown sugar and some chocolate notes. Flavour is stunningly good. Very delicate but with bags of character. Characteristic hit of dry sourness for the finish with a glorious wash of raspberry. I had this once before and it was nothing like as good. Once again Mr. J has cared for this bottle expertly well.
Eylenbosch Frater Ambrosius;Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);GBBF - Bottle 1986. Tobacco and cherry. Quite sweet. Like cough sweets. Fairly simple. Almost childish. OK.

Black Fort Premium Lager;Rojrachak, Raisen, Madhya Pradesh, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Som Distilleries & Breweries;Pale gold with no head at all (nearly completely flat). Despite this, the beer is solid. Its highly drinkable and tastes like a hybrid between a pale lager and a schwarzbier. Also, I kind of like flat beers.
Black Fort Premium Lager;Rojrachak, Raisen, Madhya Pradesh, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Som Distilleries & Breweries;Straw coloured, low head moderate condition.

Bière du Foudre (Lutry) Bière du Dahu;Paudex, Switzerland;Flavored - Fruit;Bière du Foudre;Very nice and original colour, like pink grapefruit, hazy, with a beautiful head and magnificent lace. Exceptional fruity aroma, muscatel grapes and some hop. Pleasant taste, with still some beer character, not completely hidden by the fruit (raspberries), which gives just an additional touch. The palate is strong, maybe just too much on the bitter side. A very nice surprise. Beers of Switzerland

Medium body with a somewhat syrupy entry, light to medium, blanketing and sharp carbonation and dryish finish. Not bad overall. Seems a little weak for 6.3%, but not that surprising for a Brown.

Rebellion Smuggler;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Hazyish mahogany with sticky head. Aroma hoppy and hearty. Taste citrusy and flowery, hoppier than a normal biter, but very good
Hardys & Hansons Kimberley Bitter;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Cask in The Acre, March, Cambridgeshire, England. Appearance is clear amber with a white head. Aroma is flowers and slightly astringent. Palate is light body and pleasant. Taste is sweet malt, caramel and orange. Finish is bitter but not too dry. Overall a very drinkable beer.
Hardys & Hansons Kimberley Bitter;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Cask at the Fleece Inn, Penwortham. Pours clear amber with a thin white head. Aromas of malt and sulphur. Taste is malt-sweet and chalky. Thin finish.
Hardys & Hansons Kimberley Bitter;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Draught (Woolpack, Chelmsford) Sweet fruity malty aroma. Smooth palate. Such a Greene-Kingy malty taste, but it really is a nice rich malty body. Good quaffer. Certainly on tip-top form.
Hardys & Hansons Kimberley Bitter;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Cask - light amber with a yellowish creamy head. Aroma of peaches, gooseberry, white wine. Taste of peaches, caramel and a hint of white wine with grass and gooseberry. Light roasty hint in the finish with a little bitterness. Medium body.
Hardys & Hansons Kimberley Bitter;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Cask at he wharf. Amber colour with small white head. Aroma sweet malts. Taste swet malts, not much bitterness. A bit boring.
Hardys & Hansons Kimberley Bitter;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Oh dear, I knew it couldn’t last. I have tried several new beers from Greene King recently and most had been almost acceptable, quite pleasant even. But then I have a pint of this. To describe it as brown water is an insult to dear old H2O. The old Kimberley brew used to be slightly sweet and quite distinctive. No doubt Greene King mouthed some platitudes at the time about matching flavours etc. when they summarily closed the Kimberley Brewery but several years on this thin tasteless bilge is a travesty of its revered ancestor. As a punishment for making such appalling beer, Rooney Anand should be made to stand in a corner and drink 10 pints of the bloody stuff. Terrible.
Hardys & Hansons Kimberley Bitter;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Cask at The Three Frogs (GK), Wokingham on 11 May. Poured a clear chestnut colour, with a sizeable, dense white head. Aroma of orange zest, chewy malt and Greene King yeast. Pretty sweet flavour, not too saccharine. Some brown sugar, lots of malt and a very small amount of grassy hop. Finish was toffee, cooked fruit and copper.
Hardys & Hansons Kimberley Bitter;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Hand-pulled pint in ’Jaspers’ during a CAMRA pub crawl around Shifnal, Shropshire on 14th Dec 13. Refreshing but fairly bland ’cooking bitter’ (as my father calls bog standard bitters): leaning towards orange from golden amber in colour with a thin white head. Slight aroma of light malts with a fruity hint. The taste was also of light malts and again with a mild fruit note or two: nothing powerful or strong though, this is an uncomplicated brew with few if any noticeable attributes worthy of mentioning.
Hardys & Hansons Kimberley Bitter;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Cask @ The Stapleton Tavern, Stroud Green. Marmalade orange, fairly sweet malts with a boring bitter finish.
Hardys & Hansons Kimberley Bitter;Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;"(Cask at ""The Baron of Beef"" in Cambridge, England). Aroma and taste of caramel malt and hops, the taste is also very sour and boring. Bad Bitter!"
Anker Bir Pilsener;Jakarta, Indonesia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;PT Delta (San Miguel);The hash indonesia official beer. Just a regular blond beer. Cheap but nothing special
Anker Bir Pilsener;Jakarta, Indonesia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;PT Delta (San Miguel);330ml bottle from Coco Supermarket, Ubud, Bali (Rp 19,900): A very clear and light looking beer that's golden amber coloured with a half centimetre, bubbly white head on top that has okay retention at least. It's light on the nose with more slunk than I'd have liked plus some basic corn and adjuncts without anything to grab your attention. It's a semi-sweet aroma with the corn and skunks carrying through to the taste and not a lot else showing. It's got a faint and basic bitterness to proceedings but the balance is all over the place and it's not particularly enjoyable sadly - really poor stuff and the worst so far in Indonesia.
Anker Bir Pilsener;Jakarta, Indonesia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;PT Delta (San Miguel);330ml can at 4.77%. Pours bright gold with a medium head. Aroma is corn and lemon. Taste has lemon to start with corn on the finish. Sweet finish. Not too bad.
Anker Bir Pilsener;Jakarta, Indonesia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;PT Delta (San Miguel);Bottle. Brewing cereal, light and airy. Bit of sweetcorn in the finish. Worked nicely for a hot humid Jakarta evening, but probably a major miss under any other scenario.
Anker Bir Pilsener;Jakarta, Indonesia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;PT Delta (San Miguel);330ml Flasche. Klar und golden mit minimaler Schaumkrone. Getreidig. Muffig. Leichter Körper. Mild.
Anker Bir Pilsener;Jakarta, Indonesia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;PT Delta (San Miguel);Can shared with JMD at HNB 04.02.18. Clear pale golden. Diminishing white head. Weak and sweet aroma, with hints of grass, lemon and wine gum. Medium sweet and artificial taste, with hints of lemon, sweet pilsner malt and wine gum.
Anker Bir Pilsener;Jakarta, Indonesia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;PT Delta (San Miguel);0,5 boks (gave fra Sigmund), delt med skibsrederen før tapping av Holmens Citra: klar gylden med kort skum. Svak aroma av kokt mais og citrus. Tynn, emmen smak av samme, og med en velsignet kort ettersmak.
Anker Bir Pilsener;Jakarta, Indonesia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;PT Delta (San Miguel);Same as with all Indonesian beers I know. Drinkable when served icecold, then, of course quite refreshing after a hot day. But on a global scale, these beers are below average Lagers and won't stand any test. Anker does not manage to stand out from its local peers as well.
Anker Bir Pilsener;Jakarta, Indonesia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;PT Delta (San Miguel);[backlog] 24-05-15 // from the bottle at Chill Out Bar, Gili Air, Indonesia. Icecold on a hot day, okay. Otherwise not.
Anker Bir Pilsener;Jakarta, Indonesia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;PT Delta (San Miguel);Bottle. This could be soda water in a blind taste test. maybe not bad when it is sweltering but don’t take this our of Bali.
Anker Stout;Jakarta, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;PT Delta (San Miguel);620ml bottle from Hero Supermarket, Yogyakarta, Java (Rp 45,000): Black in colour & opaque, this one is topped with a half centimetre head that's beige & bubbly but holds quite well. There was some bubbles on both the surface & through the body of the beer whilst head retention was good too. The nose is a dark & semi-sweet one with some faint alcohol notes & sugars, it had a hint of a foreign extra stout about it with some liquorice showing & a little lactose towards the end. The taste is a little more uneven with some roasted malts & nutty flavours to start followed by some toasted malts & earthy touches but nothing is too pronounced. The body is a medium one but it's quite sweet & oily with a smooth feel that's softly carbonated too but balanced & easy to drink. It seems a little stronger than the alcohol content suggested, with only a tiny bit of alcohol showing but it was enjoyable throughout & one of the better Indonesian beers I’ve tried too.
Anker Stout;Jakarta, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;PT Delta (San Miguel);330ml bottle. Pours very dark brown with a large head. Aroma is dusty roast, yeast, cola and cocoa. Taste has cocoa to start, cola on the finish with a beefy yeast aftertaste.
Anker Stout;Jakarta, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;PT Delta (San Miguel);Can 33 cl. Brown-black beer with noisy brown foam. Aroma: sweet, caramel, jam from berries, bread, fruit esters, sweetness and light sourness. Taste a bit simpler: caramelized, slightly roasted barley, bread crusts, jam, mild hop bitterness, drinkable.

Anker Stout;Jakarta, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;PT Delta (San Miguel);Puszka 330ml, dzięki Andrzej i Wojtek. Barwa ciemnobrązowa z rubinowymi błyskami, piana średnia szybko znika. Aromat bardzo przyjemny, owocowy rodzynki, figi, śliwki suszone i winne zapachy. W smaku to samo, półsłodkie wino, bardzo łagodny na podniebieniu, goryczka słaba. Zaskakująco dobre piwo choć raczej w kierunku barley wein.
Anker Stout;Jakarta, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;PT Delta (San Miguel);Bottle. This is a simple little stout with a bit of sweetness and some corn funk in the finish.
Anker Stout;Jakarta, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;PT Delta (San Miguel);bottle. black with brown dense head. aroma and taste of roasted malts, bread. light body, dry, carbonation medium to high.
Anker Stout;Jakarta, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;PT Delta (San Miguel);In Indonesia on vacation trying to sample as many new beers as I can. Not like the sweeter/milk stouts that we get in the US. This is a foreign extra...think Guinness. A lighter one @ 4.9%, but has a good chocolate malt flavor...actually a little better than expected. Aroma is slightly yeasty. Overall, very drinkable...prices are good here...and one I would sample again for sure.
Anker Stout;Jakarta, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;PT Delta (San Miguel);Flesje uit de supermarkt in Indonesië. Heel donkere kleur, plakkerige kraag die inzakt tot een randje. Ruikt naar koffie en gebrande mout. De smaak is minder, wat koffie en drop tonen met een wat zurige afdronk. Weinig body, wat waterig. Weer eens wat anders dan dat Bintang pils.
Anker Stout;Jakarta, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;PT Delta (San Miguel);well defiantly not the best stout i have had. probably closer to the worst. although its not offensive to drink it lacks body and flavour of better brewed stouts. but I’m in indonesia and ill take what i can get. and smile while I’m drinking it.
Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (Indonesian);Central Java, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Pt. Multi Bintang (Heineken);"330ml Bottle from Gilimart on Gili T, Lombok (Rp 45,000): Dark ruby to black with quite a large, thick looking head that was creamy but required quite an aggressive pour whilst head retention was good & the beer looked creamy; there was the odd bubble on the surface too. The nose was very light & hard to detect, with none of the expected sweetness showing but when it eventually opened up there was some faint malts & lactose showing alongside background sugars. Thankfully the taste was more pronounced with some sweet malts, milky flavours & a little sweetness too before some roasted & bitter malts seen things out. The body was smooth & softly carbonated with a background sweetness but it was too light & nowhere near as good as some of the other Guinness Foreign Extra beers I've tried from around the world over the years; it was at least a step up from the standard pale lagers the dominate the Indonesian beer seen at least though."
Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (Indonesian);Central Java, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Pt. Multi Bintang (Heineken);320ml can. Pours jet black with a small head. Aroma is oily roast, tar and liquorice. Taste is burnt and oily, with sour roast malt and liquorice.

Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (Indonesian);Central Java, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Pt. Multi Bintang (Heineken);Can. Very dark brown with light brown head. Good introduction to the stout style i guess. Roasted malt and syrup. Fairly low bitterness for the style ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (Indonesian);Central Java, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Pt. Multi Bintang (Heineken);Can. Nice simple version of the stylistic classic. A little lighter on the palette than the original.
Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (Indonesian);Central Java, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Pt. Multi Bintang (Heineken);Not much to find in Bali, but this and Anker Stout pretty much it for dark beer. I grabbed a couple singles forgetting that it’s not the same 7% foreign extra that we get here in the states. Couldn’t really find much difference between this and the regular Guinness Extra Stout that’s about 5% and change. Maybe a little lighter with less flavor actually, but still a decent stout.
Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (Indonesian);Central Java, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Pt. Multi Bintang (Heineken);Aroma: chocolate, toasted malts, caramel. Appearance: black, small, frothy, beige head. Taste: light bitter. Palate: coffee, toasted malts, sours coming up, dry finish. Overall: sub-standard interpretation of the FES, too sweet in aroma, to bitter in palate, yet if you are in Indonesia would surely prefer that over local lagers. Bottle from a friend (thanks Marco!).
Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (Indonesian);Central Java, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Pt. Multi Bintang (Heineken);"""The basis is an unfermented but hopped Guinness wort extract shipped from Dublin, which is added to local ingredients and brewed locally."" Now lets see, we’ll add a lot of rice and sugar and the not particularly palatable local water and brew it up! Result, a not very good imitation of Guinness. Since the general run of beer in Indonesia is of such poor quality (lucky to have any at all in the world’s most populous Muslim country) I would seek this out where it was available, mostly in Bali. Not so hot."
Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (Indonesian);Central Java, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Pt. Multi Bintang (Heineken);Butelka na lotnisku. Kolor ciemnobrązowy, piana jasnobrązowa, trwała. Aromaty palonego słodu i lekko wanilii, ziemiste.W smaku lekko kwaskowe, palony słód. Nagazowanie dobre, niezłe piwo jak na Indonezję.
Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (Indonesian);Central Java, Indonesia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Pt. Multi Bintang (Heineken);620ml bottle. Pours dark brown with a big creamy head which dissolves into big bubbles. Roasty aroma, but not intense. Slight bread taste, but not near as much as the original Guinness. Roasty bitterness. After 3 weeks of Bintang and Bali Hai, this is a relevation.
Dux de Lux Dux Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Dux Brewing Co.;On tap @Dux Live. Golden colour, with a small head. Malt and hop flavour, quite complex. Medium-strong bitterness
Dux de Lux Dux Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Dux Brewing Co.;Clean and light, this was not a bad brew, but very unoffensive to anyone. Easy drinking brew, but not much imagination.
Dux de Lux Dux Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Dux Brewing Co.;Bottled. A golden beer with a thin white head. The aroma has notes of malt and straw. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt and straw, leading to a lightly bitter finish.
Dux de Lux Dux Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Dux Brewing Co.;Aroma: slightly hoppy, hint of spruce, grass. Appearance: pale, hazy, frothy head, good lacing lasted the duration. Taste: no trace of sweetness or sour, heavy bitterness and hoppy. More of a pale ale than a lager. Palate: medium body with slightly creamy texture, no fizz and clean finish Overall: Very nice. Not at all complicated but still a definitive beer.
Dux de Lux Dux Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Dux Brewing Co.;Draft at Dux de Lux in Queenstown. This was the last DDL beer I tried, for a total of 8 between the two brewpubs. Pours clear gold with a small white head. Aroma and of straw, hops, citrus, grain, and corn. Malty, citrusy flavor. Pretty good for a lager, as I’ve found a lot of NZ lagers to be.
Dux de Lux Dux Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Dux Brewing Co.;Draught at Dux de Lux, Queenstown. Pours clear golden with a diminished white head. Smooth crisp malt flavour with citrus tones. Mild bitterness with a thin, crisp finish.
Dux de Lux Dux Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Dux Brewing Co.;Pours clear gold with a white head that diminishes quickly. Has a mildly ginger, orange nose. Grassy hops, some floral notes. Rather plain flavours... A nice hoppy bitterness, hints of straw malt and some ginger. Alcohol is surprisingly obvious... Boring, but nice and bitter.
Dux de Lux Dux Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Dux Brewing Co.;On tap 01.05.09 at the Dux de Lux in Christchurch. Clear gold with white head. Aroma is corn, and some bitter hops. Flavor is corn, malt, watery.
Dux de Lux Dux Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Dux Brewing Co.;Bottle, pours a crystal clear dark gold, some bubbles and a pillowy white head. A rather non-descript bready malt on the nose. An over-complicated palate for my mind - bready, sweet malt and dry metallic, hops compete. There is a floweryness thrown in their too. More flavoursome than most lagers dare, but I struggled to enjoy this.
Dux de Lux Dux Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Dux Brewing Co.;Good standard lager yellow, firm decent head. Flowery, slight dusty aroma. Nice fresh grainy flavours come through along with grassy hop notes. Nothing better ice cold on a sunny Sunday afternoon in the Dux courtyard.
Naked Aspen Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;From old tasting notes. Reddish brown color topped by a big rocky tan head. Mild toasted malt aroma. Bittersweet toasted malt flavor hints at cognac.
Naked Aspen Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;brown in color but not afraid to let a little reddish gleam through its doors..thin head of halo'd whiteness.. Aroma was unique for a brown..fruity maltiness with lingering chocolate chip cookie dough..yeasty.. cookie dough rolled with cherries..tartness..nuttiness..sherry-like..a unique brown..however, might be ordinary if labeled differently..starts to turn creamy but ends before it has the opportunity to.. the immature creaminess resembles metal
Fire Station 5 Pike Pole Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Fire Station 5 Brewing Company--Pike Pole Porter--2002 Release--12 oz. Bottle--5.50% ABV? (4.0 / 5.0) Porter--Clear dark obsidian black color. Light tan medium laced head. Roasted crusty mild hop front. Light sweet creamy smooth roasted dry light fruit body. Crusty smooth mild hop end. Tasty drinkable nice Porter. Sampled 7/15/200.
Fire Station 5 Pike Pole Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);smells very good, like roasted malt and coffee. it also looks quite tasty and is an opaque brownish black with little to no head. there isn’t really much of a taste, it actually tastes a little like its been watered down. there is, however, a slight bitterness and roasted quality to the flavor that can be tasted after a couple sips. its fairly bitter and nicely astringent at the end. i’m satisfied with this brew. B
Fire Station 5 Pike Pole Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle. Pours a clear amber brown with a small off-white head. Aroma of light roasted malt and caramel. Taste is the same as aroma. Medium thin mouthfeel with a mild amount of bitterness. Good.
Fire Station 5 Pike Pole Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Overall an un eventful porter. Lacking a bit of everything, but very drinkable.
Fire Station 5 Pike Pole Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle. Pours clear rubied brown with a thin and fading off-white head from an aggressive pour. It does produce a bit of lace. Light pine and roast notes in the nose. Light body and fine carbonation. A small dash of chocolate and some smoke in the taste. The texture goes a bit watery in the middle. Crisp and not too bitter finish. Seems a bit one-dimensional.
Fire Station 5 Pike Pole Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Dan Journal #2. Tasted 4/11/2006. This tasted bitter and past its prime, I hope! Sour edge that made this one a drain pour. But I’m willing to give a fresh one another shot.
Fire Station 5 Pike Pole Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Very nice, roasty aroma. Equally roasty front end with coffee notes. Finish is a bit weak with mild coffee flavor. An easy-to-drink porter that is no better than average in my opinion. However, it can regularly be had for less than $6 a six pack.
Fire Station 5 Pike Pole Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Silly name. Pours black with a large tan head that dissipates quickly. Faint chocolate and malt. Medium light body, notes of chocolate. Faint coffee and roast notes in the finish. I can’t rave about this beer nor damn it either.
Fire Station 5 Pike Pole Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12-oz. What a mindless name. You have to wonder whether they’ll come out with a staff stick stout if the same people are running the marketing department. Pours a deep opaque black with a huge, bubbly, moussy tan head. Looks gorgeous! Very light notes of chocolate and roast in the nose, but mostly dust. The attack is the closest to vacant I’ve found in a porter: light body, almost watery at times. Low carb. Subdued floavors. Granted, porters are the sessions of the stout world, but even moderation must be moderated. Mid-palate’s more of the same fermented sominex: slightest hints of roast and chocolate to go with the dust. No finish. I guess if this is a biblical beer, it’ll inherit the earth.
Fire Station 5 Pike Pole Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);poured from bottle. thick dark brown color with just a little bit of light coming through, tan head. aromas of malt and chocolate. thick palate with just the right amount of carbonation. complex charcaters in the flavor, with notes of coffee, chocolate, malts. and a slight sour after fast, finishes with a metallic flavor.
Wynkoop B3K Schwarzbier;Denver, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Nowhere near the best schwarzbier, probably even in Denver, but an admirable, tasty recipe. Perfect coloration and well balanced hops and malts. Tried for the first time at the brewery in 2010.
Wynkoop B3K Schwarzbier;Denver, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Backlog entry: Flight at the brewery in Denver. Decent beers, all average. Most on the lighter side but aligned with the style.
Wynkoop B3K Schwarzbier;Denver, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Draft at Wynkoop. Poured a dark brown cola color with a small tan head. Aroma was light roasted malt notes, light nutty notes. Light herbal and touch of earthy notes. Burnt chocolate.
Wynkoop B3K Schwarzbier;Denver, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wynkoop Brewing Company;right down the middle .. . dark amber brown .. good mouth feel .. roast and toast .. pretty good dark lager .. . . my stomach is in knots! why did i eat all that rope!?!
Wynkoop B3K Schwarzbier;Denver, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery, 11/21/2015. Dark malts and a bit of smoke on the aroma. Tastes similar with a clean, mild finish. Bready notes as well. Light-medium body. Solid.
Wynkoop B3K Schwarzbier;Denver, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Can. A- Roasty, malty, slightly tart. A- Black color, dark liquid, tan head. T- Sour, subtle cocoa, malty, dry. P- Medium body, average texture, average carbonation, sour finish. O- Pretty sure this one was slightly infected because the sourness came certainly unexpected. However, it wasn’t a bad sour, it actually was fair. Not good, but drinkable.
Wynkoop B3K Schwarzbier;Denver, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Nice dark beer. Not as he ey as a stout but still has that nice, caramel, coffee hints that I love
Wynkoop B3K Schwarzbier;Denver, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Pretty good example if a schwartzbier. Lager like good carbonation. Light roast malts and English type of hops. Very clean finish.
Wynkoop B3K Schwarzbier;Denver, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wynkoop Brewing Company;December 22nd, 2012 - Now here’s a beer worth the brewery visit by itself, and GABF judges agree. Dark and black on the body, and ringed with a halo of cream colored foam on top, there’s not much special happening just with looks. But a curious nose can immediately recognize that something good is lurking in that glass. Smoked peat, barbecue, and pulled pork blend to form a savory, salivary-inducing aroma. The taste is a bit stranger, somewhat carbonated and a thinner palate that seems at odds with the flavors, but the tastes are all there, borrowed from the aroma, and filled with the same meaty, meal-like tastes that make this stand out from the other Wynkoop tasters in line.
Wynkoop B3K Schwarzbier;Denver, Colorado, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Dark malt, slight roast aroma. Very light bodied and smooth across the tongue. Moderate roast taste that turns bitter.
Wynkoop Faens Grüt;Denver, Colorado, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;On Tap at the Wynkoop Brewery, Denver 29/09/2005 Mid brown coloured and slightly rich on the palate with a spicy aroma. Some dryness in a lasting finish.
Wynkoop Faens Grüt;Denver, Colorado, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Draft from the brew pub in Denver. Dark, ruby red hue. Off-white head. Strong rosemary and honey aroma. Sour and tart. Raspberry flavor. Defintely different, but still appreciated.
Wynkoop Faens Grüt;Denver, Colorado, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Draught. Pours mahagony with a medium frothy tan head. Peppery herbal rosemary aroma with hints of sage, cinnamon and caramel lightly roasted malts. Sour rosemary malt, fruity flavor with hop notes. Medium bodied and spicy palate.
Wynkoop Faens Grüt;Denver, Colorado, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;10.02.05 Hand pump at brewpub. Cloudy amber-brown with no head. Big aromas of juniper, mint, rye bread, sourdough. Big and spicy. Kind of a kitchen sink beer, it doesn’t seem like the brewer put a whole lot of thought into making this stuff, rather just wanted to use cool ingredients. Eucalyptus, mint. Oily palate. Some nuttiness. Weird and bad, but also good. I can’t decide.
Wynkoop Faens Grüt;Denver, Colorado, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Couleur orangée aux reflets rougeâtres, apparence brouillée et opaque. Mousse persistante composée de fines bulles. Arômes d’herbes, de shampooing, de camomille sous une faible présence terreuse et organique. Flaveurs très sûres (probablement non désirée ?) se dirigeant ensuite vers les légumes bouillis. Des saveurs synthtiques de racines rappelent certaines boissons gazeuses. Absolument détestable. En fût à la brasserie, Septembre 2005.
Wynkoop Faens Grüt;Denver, Colorado, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Tap at brewery. Pours a nice, smooth brown-amber. Aroma is a Vick’s coughdrop. Flavor is herbal and cough droppy, like a Ricola. Palate is watery. Sweet, but in a medicinal kind of way rather than a sugary-sweet way. Good for when you have a cold, I suppose, but I’m not sure about drinking this on a regular basis. Weird.
Wynkoop Faens Grüt;Denver, Colorado, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;"Draught at the brewpub. Sweet, fruity, malty and of course herbal aroma, the herbal ingredients quite apparent, along with suggestions of nutmeg and cinnamon, amber/red malts and a bright, sweet, apple-like fruitiness. Very unique, to be sure. Bright red color, clear, with a lasting, thick, foamy, tan head. Sweet, intensely herbal flavor, again plenty of green, leafy herbs, some ""weedy"" flavors evident alongside brown sugar and pumpkin(?). Peppery, tangy finish, some vague citrus. Smooth, lightly carbonated palate, medium body. Lingering blend of herbs (dill?) and some woodiness (bark) to be found late. What a strange creation. Unfortunately, it was a struggle to finish this."
Wynkoop Faens Grüt;Denver, Colorado, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Hazy reddish-orange, off-white head cover. Limited aromas, hitting the leafy and piney hoppiness and more intently some spicy anise or cumin tones. Light oxidation notes remind of pennies and apples while strong DMS ruin the rest. Acetic and dull. Not a very good beer, much less a good gruit.
Wynkoop Faens Grüt;Denver, Colorado, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Draught. Head is fully diminishing. Body is dark amber/red/purple. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted bread), with a strong note of rosemary. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. Whew, lots of rosemary in the nose, clobbering almost everything else. Surprisingly light on both body and flavor in the mouth.
Wynkoop Faens Grüt;Denver, Colorado, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Draught @ Wynkoop Brewing Company in Denver, Colorado. Bright ruby color with a wispy head of large bubbles. Herbal aroma, bursting with rosemary, Italian spices (oregano), wheat grass and lemon. Very spicy and herbal flavor, extremely peppery with Italian flavors (sausage, brat), gale and oregano. Almost spicy, as in hot! Clearly no balance between the malt and spice here, nothing but spice and I prefer a more balanced Gruit beer. See Jopen Koyt for an unbelievable example.
Bitter End Noble Weiss;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Hell yeah, this was awesome. Citrucy, tart, bananas. Had a slight sweetness to it. Thouroughly pleased
Bitter End Noble Weiss;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Pours a cloudy murky orange bronze with a thin white ring of foam. Heavy wheaty and yeasty aroma has some banana and citrus notes. Body starts semi-sweet and very filling toward a more tart citrus and sticky wheat finish. Perhaps too thick for a weiss without much accompanying sweetness. Could use some more drinkablility for a hefeweizen.
Bitter End Noble Weiss;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Wheat malt (M); floral hops (VL); TONS of banana! Smells like banana pudding even! Hazy peach body. Lightly sweet, moderately acidic flavor becomes a moderately sweet, lightly biter, moderately acidic finish. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. The bottom line is: above average...a tasty US micro hefe."
Bitter End Noble Weiss;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Beautiful cloudy yellow body. Snow white fluffy head. Good lacing. Great banana nose. Nice citrus meets banana flavor. This is a great weizen. Very quaffable.
Bitter End Noble Weiss;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Now this was good! Total turn around from the EZ Wheat! Weak head but some lacing. Spicy smell with typical cloudiness. Strong banana flavors with spicy overtones. One of their best!
Bitter End Noble Weiss;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Very good seasonal wheat beer from the Bitter End. Crisp, sweet, and smooth. Very tasty.
Bitter End Noble Weiss;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;One of the best brew pub hefes I have had. Very refrshing and crisp, lots of sweet, but not candylike, flavor. a summertime treat.
Bitter End Noble Weiss;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Small head, yellow, very cloudy. They really ""hefed"" the hell out of this one. Very sweet, strong banana-clove. Milky, smooth mouthfeel. Quite nice, another good seasonal offering from The Bitter End."
Tuborg Porter Double Stout;Copenhagen, Denmark;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Brewery;Vintage bottle @ Friends/Chef. Appearance: pours clear dark brown with low off-white soapy head and lacing. aroma/taste: barley, bread, caramel, light oxidized hops, chocolate, light alcohol, honey and light coffee. palette: medium roasted malty aroma, low carbonation, medium body, medium to notable sweetness, unbalanced by a light to medium bitterness, average duration and a watery texture. Overall: age beginning to show but still decent
Tuborg Porter Double Stout;Copenhagen, Denmark;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Brewery;Rating from memory, not so much the beer but the impact. Was in Copenhagen for a weekend with the now missus a long time ago, ordered 2 pints of this, I had one sip and thought it was one of the worse things I ever tasted and ordered something else, the missus stuck it out and the only bit of luck she had was the toilet and sink were in close proximity in the hotel room. Waste of a supposed ’romantic’ weekend. Lived in Copenhagen afterwards and it may have been the bar, dirty tourist s$%^hole.
Tuborg Porter Double Stout;Copenhagen, Denmark;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Brewery;Draught. Thick black colour with a nice creamy light brown long lasting head. Aroma of well roasted malts, bitter hops, caramel, chocolate, coffee, liquorice, which appears well in the flavour. Dry chocolate bitter finish. Long aftertaste. A great brew indeed!
Tuborg Porter Double Stout;Copenhagen, Denmark;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Brewery;very dark amber/red color, medium head, some, caramel, licorice and nuts, ingredients are clear.
Tuborg Porter Double Stout;Copenhagen, Denmark;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Brewery;(On tap) Almost pitch black, only a vague reddish glow. Beige coloured head leaving laces. Malty, roasted aroma. Medium body with pleasant notes of licorice and dark chocolate. Very burned malt leaving a strong bitterness. The alcohol is scaringly well hidden. 130106
Tuborg Porter Double Stout;Copenhagen, Denmark;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Brewery;Pours black/redish with a thin tan head. Fruity, dark chocolate nose. Sweet flavour with a roasty palate, and hints of burnt coffee. Too high co2. Slightly acidic in finish.
Tuborg Porter Double Stout;Copenhagen, Denmark;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Brewery;Draught. Dark brown coloured with a small beige head. Sweet aroma of liquorice, malts and muscavado sugar. Nice and complex flavour of liquorice, grain, dark chocolate, dried fruit, malts and dried fruit. Hoppy finish with notes of liquorice and chocolate. Tastes like a mixture of a good porter and a decent lager, luckily the porter flavours are dominating. It also tastes like the first porter I’ve had many years ago :-)
Tuborg Porter Double Stout;Copenhagen, Denmark;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Brewery;Draught. Black colour with a medium baige head. Light roasted malty chocolate liquorice aroma and taste, light sweet. Medium to full body and a light sweet dry finish.
Tuborg Porter Double Stout;Copenhagen, Denmark;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Brewery;"On tap from the bar in the ground floor of my building. Thick black, with creamy tan head. Slightly fruity aroma with hints of alcohol, but not much else going on in the nose (could be due to the low temperature at which this beer was poured). The flavor is brutal; with licorice, charcoal, caramel and a long bitter aftertaste. Too carbonated, but a creamy mouth feel evolves as the beer warms. An extremely assertive and nonetheless pretty balanced beer."
Tuborg Porter Double Stout;Copenhagen, Denmark;Porter - Baltic;Carlsberg Brewery;Draught at Arkade-baren, Copenhagen. Black as the night with a nice beige head. Aroma is not too heavy but has notes of roasted malt and liquorice. Flavor is quite full of roasted malt, liquorice, smoke and coffee. Nice balanced bitterness, also in the finish. A nice and flavorfull beer that is rarely available!
North Peak Wheat;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;North Peak Brewing Company;Stubby bottle at Mark and Christine’s on thanksgiving More like a wheat pale ale then a traditional wheat beer very subdued and watery meh
North Peak Wheat;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;North Peak Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a clear orangish gold with a sudsy head and weak aromas of oranges and dough, but with little intrigue. Flavor is pretty dominated by oranges and wheat, but a very clear wheat that leaves behind a crispness and makes way for a bitter aftertaste of citrus and herbs. Pretty nice stuff for a simple summer brew.
North Peak Wheat;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;North Peak Brewing Company;Stubby bottle, has an hazy orange and dark gold pour with a large white foamy head, head is foamy and stays around, there are lots of bubbles in this beer and the effervescence hangs around just like the head, the bottle did not have any sediment on the bottom but there is enough haziness to assume the beer is not filtered, light fruit aromas of lemon and orange, faint scent of field flowers from the hops?, light malt and grain, little sweetness on the nose, flavors of light toasted malt, wheat and citrus hops, gentle spices and little sweetness on the palate, medium hop bitterness, mouth feel is light with lots of carbonation, a nice beer.
North Peak Wheat;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;North Peak Brewing Company;Tap at brewery. Actually had the Toasted Wheat...I assume that is this, if not, my apologies. Opaque caramel color, almost muddy, definate taste of toasted wheat. A little thin as far as mouth feel, but not a bad beer.
North Peak Wheat;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;North Peak Brewing Company;"I’m a wheat beer head, but this one was just average. The banana and clove flavor was evident but not overwhelming. I also noted a slight ""dirty"" malt finish that I attribute to possibly the wheat germ factor. I’m not sure. This would be the only real minus for this beer. Not the best, but it is worth drinking."
North Peak Wheat;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;North Peak Brewing Company;I've had a few brewpub wheats like this, one in New Orleans and one in Ann Arbor. What I'm referring to is the thick banana powered cream that is so over the top it makes you wonder if you are drinking beer or a McDonalds banana shake. It needs some balance somewhere as it lurches esterily across the palate.
Šampion Svetlo;Vršac, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vršacka Pivara;Friends have spotted and I guess we now resurrect this shining beer from Vrsac. I found a case of the Sampion Svetlo at the kafana Zlatno Burence. Tried my first tonight and here is the report: 0.5l bottle. Very pale yellow, looks awful with a yellow foam head. Eggs, honey, sour cheeses or expiered milk. Pretty awful and weird notes /ideas that are coming up in this beer. Tart carbonation, I could see a headache coming after this. That said, well worth trying out for those who want to try all Serbia has to offer. This isnt a good one but you’ll be glad you tasted it once
Šampion Svetlo;Vršac, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vršacka Pivara;0,5 l bottle. Crappy lager, whose taste is composed of sweetish malty, butterscotch, bread and some weird soap/ acid aromas. Foul smell and aftertaste. One of the worse in Serbia.
Šampion Svetlo;Vršac, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vršacka Pivara;Canned(330ml). -below average Yugoslavian lager with not so specially good taste
Pilka Svijetlo Pivo;Mursko Središće, Croatia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovara i Pivnica Cimper;05/04 On tap at restaurant Pilka, Cakovec (former brewpub). Slightly murky golden body with medium white head. Aroma is dominated by sourness (unpasteurized), light flower and citrus hops and some malty fruits. Flavor nice, slightly bitter, sourish as well, but too light, watery. Finish is therefore short, although fine sweetish derived from hoppy bitterness. For all that goes down easily and it is a great summer thirst quencher.
Pilka Svijetlo Pivo;Mursko Središće, Croatia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovara i Pivnica Cimper;1l fliptop bottle courtesy of heavy, who brought it from Čakovec (a huge thanks for lugging it around!) Poured a lovely hazy honeyish orange-golden colour with a small, somewhat thick white head that went away fast. Light, soft, pleasant nose... grainy, somewhat yeasty, some fruitiness. The taste is nice but maybe a bit too light for its own good. A smooth if weak grainy, malty base, surrounded by a fence of one dimensional woody hoppy bitterness, with some pleasant lemony-fruity notes connecting the two. Some yeastiness pops up from time to time as well. Not a world beater but a nice, pleasant little beer. I could see myself going out to Pilka or Cimper and enjoying a few of these.
Pilka Svijetlo Pivo;Mursko Središće, Croatia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovara i Pivnica Cimper;Sampled draught at Pilka, Cakovec, Croatia. -honey non-transparent colour, little white quick-disappearing head, strong yeast aroma
Union Brezalkoholno Pivo;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pivovarna Union (Laško);Very very nice beer, i really can’t figure out why this beer is rated so low. One of the best 0,5% i’ve ever had. Nice beer-like taste.
Union Brezalkoholno Pivo;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pivovarna Union (Laško);"Aroma; fruits in the cooked vegetables, pale sweet malts, sweet leaves.

Union Brezalkoholno Pivo;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pivovarna Union (Laško);Bottiglia. L'intensità olfattiva è appena percepibile e l'esistenza olfattiva è sfuggente. Il cappello di schiuma resiste abbastanza. La grandezza delle bollicine è grossolana. Il liquido è di consistenza limpida. Poche bollicine medio-fini costituiscono la forma della frizzantezza costituiscono la forma del perlage. Il colore è giallo dorato brillante. Il corpo è scarno. L'amaro è assente.

Union Brezalkoholno Pivo;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pivovarna Union (Laško);Enjoyed: Poured from a bottle into English pint glass. Appearance: Clear golden colour, with medium but densely head. Aroma: Barley, grains. Palate: Watery, light body, soft carbonation. Taste: Water, sweet (corn), gentle bitterness. Overall impression: Refreshing and drinkable, quite good, one of the better non-alcoholic beer that I had.
Union Brezalkoholno Pivo;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pivovarna Union (Laško);Couleur dorée, aucune mousse. Nez malt d’orge. Gout leger malt d’orge, note acidulée et houblonnée, très aqueux avec mauvaise fin de bouche metallique.
Union Brezalkoholno Pivo;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pivovarna Union (Laško);Can 50cl shared by Calisky. A clear yollow beer with low head. Nose is on grain and barley sugar, touch of apple. Aroma is on grain, some bitterness, light apple / fruit notes, dusty hops flavor. Ok there is nothing outstanding here, but in the average of low alcohol.
Fancy Pants Pub Ale;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;Fancy Pants Brewing Co. (formerly Neversink Brewing);Not being a huge fan of milder session beers, I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this one. Typical of a session beer or a mild bitter, this mild ale featured an excellent balance of malt and hops - but in a toned down beverage. Immensely drinkable. All the great english flavors without the chalkiness from their water.
Dux de Lux Ginger Tom - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Dux Brewing Co.;#3 hoptoberfest at the volstead - a pretty weak and watery ginger beer. quaffable.
Dux de Lux Ginger Tom - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Dux Brewing Co.;Bottle clear golden amber color. Aroma of ginger, light citrus, blackbpepper. Sharp ginger and pepper in the taste. OK.
Dux de Lux Ginger Tom - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Dux Brewing Co.;From the archives of my notes: Pours a light straw - golden with a touch of haze, full on aromas of golden ginger and citrus. Same evident in flavours, prickly mouthfeel and loads of carbonation from bottle conditioning. An excellent palate cleanser or to accompany a curry. Have set aside a small supply of this (since long gone, but I might just go out and get some more considering what I wrote a year or two ago).
Dux de Lux Ginger Tom - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Dux Brewing Co.;Bottled. A hazy golden beer with a thin beige head. The aroma has strong notes of ginger combined with medium notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, and other spices. The flavor is sweet again with strong notes of ginger combined with medium notes of cinnamon, leading to a dry finish. The body is light.
Dux de Lux Ginger Tom - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Dux Brewing Co.;Draft at Dux De Lux in Christchurch. Pours slightly cloudy gold with almost no head. The ginger is absolutely aggressive on the nose and palate. It masks most other notes, but I did pick up on honey, citrus, malt, and sugar. Spicy, peppery, caustic mouthfeel from the heavy dose of ginger, and sticky from the other sweeteners. Very sweet overall, especially upon the finish.
Dux de Lux Ginger Tom - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Dux Brewing Co.;Is what it is, a ginger beer. Not necessarily in the traditional sense, as it’s a basic lager brewed with a buttload of ginger. Yummy though, for what it is. Honey sweetness I quite enjoyed!
Dux de Lux Ginger Tom - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Dux Brewing Co.;Draught at Dux de Lux, Queenstown. Another Kiwi alcoholic ginger beer...Pours golden with a white head that fell flat and disappeared. Aroma of ginger and lemon. The flavour is ginger, lemon and honey. Thin bodied, mild bitterness and a peppery finish.
Dux de Lux Ginger Tom - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Dux Brewing Co.;On tap 01.05.09 at the Dux de Lux in Christchurch. Clear orange gold, no head. Aroma is super ginger. Flavor is ginger with some malt. Not my cup of tea. Reminds me of a cider.
Dux de Lux Ginger Tom - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Dux Brewing Co.;Bottle, pours a clear light amber, but with no head. Looks like a ginger ale. Not surprisingly a ginger aroma, some sweetness, with a hint of the honey. The ginger and honey comes through in the taste, but there is a decent amount of malt on the palate that makes this more ’beer’ than ’ginger’. A spicy/peppery finish. I’m a big ginger ber fan (more of the non-alcoholic variety), and I’d happily drink this on a hot summer’s day.
Dux de Lux Ginger Tom - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Dux Brewing Co.;It doesn’t look or smell like much but I’m easy to please when it comes to ginger beer. This one has a nice bite (like my home made soft version) with the added bonus of a bit of booze. Not at all like the cheap stuff in big plastic bottles. The dux is always on my list if I go to Chch.
Dux de Lux Hereford Bitter;Christchurch, New Zealand;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Dux Brewing Co.;Bottled. A deep red beer with a thin tan head. The aroma has notes of malt and caramel as well as a touch of hops. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt, toffee, and hops, leading to a nicely bitter finish.
Dux de Lux Hereford Bitter;Christchurch, New Zealand;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Dux Brewing Co.;500 ml bottled Aroma: hint of coffee, chocolate malt and indistinct yeast. Appearance: Dark reddish brown hue, clear with frothy off-white head of very short duration and no lacing. Taste: thin (chocolate) and mildly bitter, no hint of sweetness and just slightly sour. Palate: medium bodied, slightly creamy, soft carbonation and short finish with a touch of bitterness. Not their best effort. I will try to find this on tap or simply drink it at room temperature and see what may be revealed.
Dux de Lux Hereford Bitter;Christchurch, New Zealand;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Dux Brewing Co.;Enjoyed this beer. Don’t understand the naming... but hey, nice drinking, mild bitterness, and good palate. And let’s face it, for a 4% beer, well done.
Dux de Lux Hereford Bitter;Christchurch, New Zealand;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Dux Brewing Co.;Chocolate milkshake head in colour,lager is dark red/brown aroma caramel and chocolate head back to fine cover,vanilla aroma flavour chocolate and caramel vanilla touch has some flair in the malt taste,bright flavours bitter decent sweetness as well at the finish a very pleasing tasting beer.
Dux de Lux Hereford Bitter;Christchurch, New Zealand;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Dux Brewing Co.;Not really a bitter, but a nice quaff-able dark lager. Sweet biscuit malt that finishes reasonably clean with a hint of sweetness reminiscent of more main stream kiwi draughts. No bitterness to speak of but a reasonable drink on a sunny day
Dux de Lux Hereford Bitter;Christchurch, New Zealand;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Dux Brewing Co.;Draft at Dux de Lux in Christchurch. Pours copper with a small off-white head. Hoppy aroma with citrus, malt, and caramel. Flavor is also hoppy, but also sweet malt and citrus. Light-medium boxy. Smooth, syrupy, and easy to drink. Not nearly as bitter as expected, and not very complex.
Dux de Lux Hereford Bitter;Christchurch, New Zealand;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Dux Brewing Co.;500ml bottle. Dark brown with ruby hue. Small, mostly diminishing, light brown head, good lacing. Roasted malt, toffee, caramel, chocolate, aromas with some nice mild hop aromas - citrus mostly, and raisin when the beer is warmer. Fairly sweet malty flavours, smooth medium bodied, mildly bitter finish ending up a bit chalky. I’m sure this tasted better when I had it on tap at the Dux de Lux in Christchurch a few years ago. Hopefully as my beer education improves I will figure out the Bitter v Dark Munich Lager v Schwarzbier mystery.
Dux de Lux Hereford Bitter;Christchurch, New Zealand;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Dux Brewing Co.;Draught at Dux de Lux, Queenstown. Pours reddish brown with a small tanned head. Toast and citrus. Smooth and bitter finish.
Dux de Lux Hereford Bitter;Christchurch, New Zealand;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Dux Brewing Co.;On tap 01.05.09 at the Dux de Lux in Christchurch. Hazy caramel, thin off white head. Aroma is floral and citrus hoppy. Flavor is bitter, earthy, light bodied.
Dux de Lux Hereford Bitter;Christchurch, New Zealand;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;The Dux Brewing Co.;Bottle, pours a dark ruby-tinted brown with a large beige head. A musty malt aroma. A sweetish roasted malt palate, which carries some bitter chocolate to the tongue at first, then becoming more fruity. The finish is tangy, but also a bit syrupy and a little short.
Monteiths Doppelbock;Greymouth, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Dark reddish-brown, rich caramel, coffee, chocolate, cigar ash, roasty, dry finish. Nice.
Monteiths Doppelbock;Greymouth, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);"Nice beer, but not to my usual taste. Dark red-brown colour. Low carbonation, not much head. Lots of malt and sugars in the mix. Can definitely taste the high alcohol content, which is a minus for me: I don;t like a beer that does me in before I can drink my fill :) Definitely a beer that does better when served closer to room temp (doesn’t suit too cold)"
Monteiths Doppelbock;Greymouth, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);8 May 2004 - Sweet spiritous malt aroma. Clear, nice dark red-brown but hardly any head and no lacing. Uncomplex mocha malt with a short taste. Bitter finish with a light flat mouthfeel.
Monteiths Doppelbock;Greymouth, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Very Malty aroma with dark back colour and little head. Bitter burnt malt flavour with smooth finish.
Monteiths Doppelbock;Greymouth, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Caramel like aroma, short but lasting light brown head, medium texture with light caramel flavours with a faint hint of coffee and warming alcohol.Good beer but not a session beer for me.
Monteiths Doppelbock;Greymouth, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Pretty disappointing. I don't understand how they can get such a nice, solid malt character in their Black, yet have it completely lacking in their Doppelbock. I think this is much closer to an English Strong/Old Ale (not a favourite style of mine) than a Doppelbock. Aroma is quite malty, but not the decocted/Munich malt aroma usually associated with a Bock. It's more caramelly and toffee-ey. Nothing particularly wrong, but not great. Clear brown colour with red highlights, with a weird looking yellow head (does this mean they're using roasted barley???) which doesn't last. Flavour is sweet and caramelly, with no apparent bitterness and a pretty sweet finish. Thick body, yet with prickly carbonation. Not my kind of beer, but I can see how people would like it.
Monteiths Doppelbock;Greymouth, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);a bit of a tough beer to bolt down outside the mcg, all because the cab driver wouldn't let us drink on the way. plenty of caramel and toffee in there but precious little soy sauce or fruitiness. a pretty bland doppelbock
Monteiths Doppelbock;Greymouth, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Nice malty aroma. Looks great dark ruby/brown but with nearly no head. Lovely doppelbock flavour with roasted notes & bitter aftertaste when too cold but blend well (not as noticeable) when at a decent temperature. Good mouthfeel, on the upper end of carbonation.
Monteiths Doppelbock;Greymouth, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Poured with no head. Big malty aroma and tons of malt in the flavour. Has a slight roasted bitterness at the end. There may even be a coffee undertone present as well. Geven my love of malty beers and this one's leanings on the malt spectrum, I should adore this. But something fails to click with this beer. On the high side of mediocre.
Monteiths Doppelbock;Greymouth, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Good deep red-brown colour, small vanishing head. Quite sweet,malty and syrupy. Has some hints of caramel/coffee with some evident alcohol in the finish. ok.

Cooks Lager;Avarua, Rarotonga, Cook Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cooks Lager Brewery;Backlog. Botteled. Gift from a friend. Not a stunning beer but some interesting tastes. Pours golden With a small white head. A sweet strange aftertaste.
Cooks Lager;Avarua, Rarotonga, Cook Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cooks Lager Brewery;Bottled gift from my daughter, braught back from Rarotonga. Pours clear golden with a small white head, enourmous amounts of small bubbles in the glass. Aroma of cooked vegetables, sweet corn and plastic. Taste is light sweet, before a citrussy sourness takes over. Fizzy carbonation. Acidic sour evil aftertaste, probably one of the worst beers i have ever tastedf.
Cooks Lager;Avarua, Rarotonga, Cook Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cooks Lager Brewery;Only brewery in the Cook Islands, actually walked by the brewery but didn’t go in cuz it looked really desolate... Mundane lager, not very crisp or enjoyable, but drinkable...
Cooks Lager;Avarua, Rarotonga, Cook Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cooks Lager Brewery;9th September 2006 Warning! Early amateur rating! Bottle in Raratonga. Sweetish start followed by a pronounced marmaladey finish. Brandyish flavours inbetween. Unusual and drinkable.
Cooks Lager;Avarua, Rarotonga, Cook Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cooks Lager Brewery;Bottle received as part of a Christmas present. Pours yellow/gold with a white head. Smells of dry malt, some appley notes, touches of pepper. Tastes dry with a decent malty character and a peppery finish. Refreshing enough as a summer sipper and light years ahead of the Sol.
Cooks Lager;Avarua, Rarotonga, Cook Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cooks Lager Brewery;Bottle - country tasting - Kobehavnske Oldage, May 2006. Pale gold colour. Dull malty character. For a fleeting moment I thought I got a faint whiff of citric hop. To that extent it was marginally better than the Flag from Mali that preceded this. Otherwise, pretty standard tropical pale lager, but fairly drinkable. Thanks to Per for sharing.
Cooks Lager;Avarua, Rarotonga, Cook Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cooks Lager Brewery;(Bottle 33 cl) Clear, deep golden with a rough, off-white head. Discreet aroma of lightly sweet malt. Medium body, sweet, bready - almost caramelish - notes. Some nuts in there as well. And Scotch?? Subdued bitterness. I believe this has gotten a bit old, but it’s actually still quite drinkable. Reminds me of Newcastle Brown.... Courtesy of Bov. 270207
Cooks Lager;Avarua, Rarotonga, Cook Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cooks Lager Brewery;"Bottled. Hazy golden in colour. Minor white head. The aroma is a blend of corn and malt. The flavour is sweet and you can taste corn and malt. it has a dry aftertaste. Thanks to ""oh6gdx"" and ""omhper"" for this one."
Cooks Lager;Avarua, Rarotonga, Cook Islands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cooks Lager Brewery;Bottled (Thanks omhper!). Golden colour, small white head. Aroma of maize and malts. flavour of malts, white bread and grassyness. Refreshing, but quite boring. Mouthdrying.
Gold Hei-Lager;Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia;Malt Liquor;La Brasserie de Tahiti (Heineken);Much headier than Hinano, even though it has a bit of that malt liquor taste.
Mt. Everest Malt Liquor;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Malt Liquor;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;Very pale yellow, kind of hazy. Big dense white head. (Yeah, I know you’re supposed to drink this kind of thing from a bottle sheathed in a paper bag, but hey, I’m a weirdo.) Aroma faint, slight grassy hops. Very sweet, light-bodied, kind of boring. Maybe with the ale yeast and all this would be better if not quite so cold.
Mt. Everest Malt Liquor;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Malt Liquor;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;Holy crap!! This is one 40 oz. I will not touch. The sweetness absolutely tore me up. I could't finish the entire 40. I left about half the bottle to just sit there. YUCK!
Mt. Everest Malt Liquor;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Malt Liquor;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;It tasted like a fruit roll up in a 40oz. version...........................
Mt. Everest Malt Liquor;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Malt Liquor;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;porus straw colored with little head. the flavor is accually pretty good for a malt liquor. no overpowering alcohol or funk, just smooth easy drinking with just a little hop bite. and it gets you buzzed
Mt. Everest Malt Liquor;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Malt Liquor;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;"An ""urban"" brew for the Midwest, Mount Everest demands that you scale it!"
Mt. Everest Malt Liquor;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Malt Liquor;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;This is about the best of the best when it comes to malt liquor. It's not quite as potent as O.E. but the flavor is worlds better. In fact this malt feels right at home in the 'hood or in the 'burbs and it still packs quite a kick - as a malt liquor should. Smooth but with a pleasant bite. Proper!
Schoenling Beer;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;This beer is popular at Cincinnati area parties, and it is pretty tasty for an American Standard - but it tends to leave a cabbage-like aftertaste if it gets old and warms up.
Schoenling Beer;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;Schoenling is tough to find but it is really a great beer. Golden, smooth with above average hop character and flavor. Definitely a step above the national brands in the American Standard category. They had this on tap at Reds games years ago but it's very rare these days.
Karsten Pils;Pančevo, Serbia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Efes Weifert Pivara (United Serbian Breweries);Bottled(500ml). -low bitterness, bad taste .................................
BJ's Rauch Bier;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Brass appearance similar to their red beer. Intense peppery, smoked aroma reminiscent of a pepper vodka I was sampled. Definitely redolent of barbeque in smell and taste. This was very unlike the smoked porter I rated. This rauch bier reminded me of smoked meats as it had a beer jerky smokiness to it that was well developed--but not suited for my palate--this definitely seems like a style that is an acquired taste. After awhile the beer seemed akin to smoked jerky left to soak in alcohol.
BJ's Whitewater Wit;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Straw colored, very hazy. Very nice citrus fruity yeasty aroma. Flavour not as bold as the aroma, a bit nutty and a bity of tinnyness.

BJ's Whitewater Wit;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;On tap at the Broadway pub in portland. Pours a hazy yellow with a tall silky smooth white head. The wheat and spice in the aroma was really overshadowed by a big lemon smell, sweet like candy lemon drops. Taste was light bodied, a big grassy but mild sweetness up front with a light hopping in the finish. This brew took it very light on the wheat, just a touch, and a light carbonation kept it very smooth.
BJ's Whitewater Wit;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Banana brown taupe color. This witbier had a sweet wheaty flavor and strong yeasty character with a mildly unpleasant offkey aftertaste.
BJ's Goliath;Huntington Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Goliath is a big burly beer. Closer to a barley wine than an Imperial Red to my palate. Lots of gooey caramel malts, but a hug whack of stark bittering hops as well. Not unlike Sierra Nevada's Celebration, it's walks the IPA line very closely. The alcohol here is aggressive and a little bit fuesel.
BJ's Goliath;Huntington Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;tap at Fort Wayne location - Pours amber with a one finger head.

BJ's Goliath;Huntington Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Strong and flavorful (full of flavor). If I ordered another beer from BJ’s, this might be the one I pick.
BJ's Goliath;Huntington Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Very very good. It did not at all strike me as a barley wine...More of a double IPA with a lot of malt. The hops on the nose were spicy and citrusy, and it was very balanced in terms of acidity, hops, and sweetness. It’s by far the best beer I’ve had at BJs (and I’ve tried most of them).

Lowenbrau Pils (UK);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Keg at the Feathers, Westminster (from old notes). Despite the Germanic styling and claimed connections with the famous brewery in Munich, this is nothing more than a bog standard UK brewed lager. Thin and fizzy, with little aroma or flavour. Virtually indistinguishable from the Fosters that one of my companions was drinking. I rather doubt that the draught version is 5.6% but there’s no indication of ABV on the font so its hard to be sure. Very bland stuff. I seem to recall Lowenbrau being a little better than other macro lager offerings but standards seem to have slipped.
Lowenbrau Pils (UK);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Can. Golden with a massive white foam. Aromas are metal and corn with some sweet caramel.

Lowenbrau Pils (UK);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Bottled, pasteurised. Gold straw with carbonated head. Dry lager with the one saving grace of a higher alcohol level, otherwise a low quality low flavoured thinness.
Lowenbrau Pils (UK);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Hey, remember when Lowenbrau was a real beer, one you could get excited about? This is better than a Bud, of course, but is now just another big company's version of a mass-market lager. Not on a par with the best Japanese mass-market lagers, like a Kirin Ichiban. My restaurant knew enough to serve it really cold, odd for the UK, but as it warmed up I realzed that the best thing about it was the refreshing coolness it started with. Great golden color too.
Lowenbrau Pils (UK);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);Standard pilsner best served cool to refresh the palate. Lacks the real quality aspects of a good pilsner.
Lowenbrau Pils (UK);Luton, Bedfordshire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Anheuser-Busch InBev UK (AB InBev);A half-decent pills, better than many of the other bottled lagers.

Stewart's Whacky Wheat Ale;Bear, Delaware, United States;Wheat Ale;Stewart's Brewing Company;Bland, bland, but manageable. It’s not terrible but there’s just no substance here by any means. I’m not a huge wheat fan & this is no exception. Boring!!

Stewart's Whacky Wheat Ale;Bear, Delaware, United States;Wheat Ale;Stewart's Brewing Company;Had it at the brewpub in Delaware. This beer was fair, no better.

Bomber purchased at BevMo in Escondido ($7.19 with 20% off). POURS on opaque dark brown (fairly black) with some lighter colored tinges at the very top, and with a half finger of light tan foam. AROMA of ashy campfire-smoked leather, hard roasted dark malts, roasted nuts, and mild chocolate and coffee. FLAVOR of sharp ashiness, burnt oak stump, black coffee (lower quality), bitter chocolate, and hints of dark fruit. Finishes mostly astringently ashy and burnt -- could benefit from a bit of sweetness. Perhaps I waited to long to open this one up and the smoked aspect took over? (511, 1146)"

Craftsman Scotch Isle Ale;Pasadena, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Craftsman Brewing Company;"Sampled on tap at Lucky Baldwin’s March 2007 This beer sits with a fairly hazy, murky, amber color in my glass, it is topped by a thin, wisp of a head that just dusts the top of the beer with a tan taint. The aroma is a mix of salt, caramel and a touch of toasted grain. I almost want to say that some peat was used here, but I’ll have to taste this beer to be sure. The taste is a touch sweet and has a reasonably full body for a lighter beer such as this. There definitely seems to be some peat smoked malt used in this recipe; it adds a salty, hearty hint of peat smoke, which really rounds out this beer. The peat is really at a nice level here. It is not overwhelming, fairly subtle, but definitely contributes to the flavor profile of this brew. Peat and sweet caramel malt notes mix in an interesting way in this beer; they really balance each other quite nicely. Salty peat is noticeable at some points, then fruity, caramel notes become noticeable and then back again to the other; back and forth these flavors mingle and play off each other. The fruit notes underneath the peat and malt are quite interesting; not particularly noticeable, but at times you get notes of prunes, berries and raisins. This is a really interesting beer, even if not a traditional interpretation (because of the peat smoked malt). This places the smoked peat character at the correct level, especially since peat can be overwhelming even in small amounts. Here it is noticeable but not in any way obtrusive or jarring."

Twisted Pine Blonde Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Twisted Pine Brewing;12 oz bottle pours golden with a white head . Aroma of malts, grains and citrus. Taste is malts . ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Twisted Pine Blonde Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Twisted Pine Brewing;Aroma is pale malts, a hint of sweetness and slightly perfumed. The flavor is malts, mild sweetness and citrus, a hint of caramel and a slightly tangy/tart finish.
Twisted Pine Blonde Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Twisted Pine Brewing;Sweet citrus aroma with hints of toffee and caramel. Lemony yellow in color with a fizzy soapy head. Sparkling, crisp and dry with a nice hops and citrus presence. Overall I thought this was really good. I was surprised, I expected a bland watery beer.
Twisted Pine Blonde Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Twisted Pine Brewing;August 11, 2011 - I’m not a big fan of blondes. Simple, shallow, and boring. I haven’t met a blonde I’ve been too excited about, and the Twisted Pine Blonde Ale is more of the same. At least one can say it’s pretty - a light yellow glow with curves and lines of orange, sort of a hazy look, and some attractive precipitation from the residual refrigerator chill. In the nose I catch some of Twisted Pine’s dedication to quality (even in the uphill battle against a style that just won’t play along), with ample banana and clove, and some corn lager aroma. White grapes and a dry champagne aroma keep this from smelling too much like a white or witbier. Light and fuzzy on the tongue, this blonde comes off as a little flat and undercarbonated. White grape juice flavors return in the taste, as well as the light corn tortilla taste, and a dry astringency. It’s hard to pick this up again when there are other attractive offerings from Twisted Pine, but I suppose the light and airy flavors have their place in a flavor line-up.
Twisted Pine Blonde Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Twisted Pine Brewing;Pale gold with a frothy, white head. The aroma is very faint with some light fruit. It has a light body with a crisp texture and lively carbonation. The taste is mildly bitter with a dry finish.
Twisted Pine Blonde Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Twisted Pine Brewing;Part of the problem with this beer sees to be false expectations. If this is a Koelsch, why call it a blonde. I was expecting something a bit citrusy with some spice, but what I got was a watery as hell bready session beer.
Twisted Pine Blonde Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Twisted Pine Brewing;Bottle- Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a decent head that fades to bits of lacing. Aroma or grain, bit of malt sweetness and trace of citrus. Flavor follows the aroma with grain and mild malt sweetness. Mild bitterness and a fairly clean finish. Seems a bit bland. Light body, with just a bit of crispness. Decent drinker, that goes down quite easy. Sort of a middle of the road for the style.
Twisted Pine Blonde Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Twisted Pine Brewing;Pours clear gold with a nice white head. Sweet bready aroma. Tate Kathe same but nicer. Very drinkable.

Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose.

Farmington River Blonde Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;not my fav style, but a nice drinkable beer, a little forgettable, didnt hate it didnt love it.
Farmington River Blonde Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Light haze on this. Maybe some wheat lending to the stable head. This has no aroma. Quite bland and light. Purely cereals with a light apple-y sweetness. Prickly and slightly soapy. Very week.
Farmington River Blonde Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle, thanks to Mei. Gold pour with some white head. Aroma is old cereal and corn, and a little sweetness. Flavor is the same with a little lemony citrus. It just seems like they purposely used bad ingredients.
Farmington River Blonde Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;February 2009 Beer of the Month Club Aroma: Citrus is the overpowering scent Appearance: Golden/orange hazy, very light white head Flavor: Light flavor, light finish, typical not very tasty aftertaste of a Blonde Palate: Light body, watery Overall Impression: Typical boring blonde, I can’t get excited for this style at all...

Aroma of cocoa, vanilla, roasted malts, and toffee. Taste is cocoa, sweet vanilla, and a little bitterness from the roasted malts. Medium body, solid stout.
Willimantic S.W.A.K. Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Willimantic Brewing Company;"on draft at brewery, NOOOOOOOOO that beautiful just stout is ruined! But a ""touch"" of vanilla, way too much vanilla, maybe im just too sensitive to it but this one was overwhelming vanilla that unfortunately sweetened the finish."
Willimantic S.W.A.K. Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Willimantic Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Pours a mostly black body with an off white head. Sweet with vanilla coffee beans, some lactose, and milk tones. A mild roast and light chocolate tone. Nice sweet stout.
Willimantic S.W.A.K. Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Willimantic Brewing Company;Tap at willi. Pours a deep dark brown almost black with a big beige head. Aroma is vanilla bean- good full chocolate roasty coffee, toast, and earthiness. Flavor is chocolate vanilla, roast, minty earthy hoppy northern brewer like hoppiness, smooth sweet- more vanilla- but nicely done- not artificial-like. Good.
Willimantic S.W.A.K. Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Willimantic Brewing Company;It figures I loose my notes on this one., but I had it only a few hours ago so here it goes. Pours black, with a brownish of white head. Aroma is primarily dominated by chocolate, with some coffee, and a touch of vanillla. As with the aroma the flavor is dominated by chocolate, with some hints of coffee and a slight vanilla taste. I can see where it may be too sweet for some,but for me it was delicous
Willimantic S.W.A.K. Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Willimantic Brewing Company;notes from 3/10/08: on tap at brewpub. Pours a dark brown. Aroma is of intense vanilla, maybe some roasts but not much more. Flavor is sweet of vanilla, cream and sugar. To be honest, this tasted like a light-bodied stout mixed with vanilla coke. I didn’t appreciate the one-sidedness of this brew, nor its soda-sweetness. I suppose that if you are looking for a DESSERT drink this could be the right play, but certainly not what I was expecting from a stout, sweet or otherwise.
Willimantic S.W.A.K. Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Black with a brown head. Sweet chocolate flavors, a touch of coffee and mellow vanilla. Excellent texture, silky smooth, just a shade thin. Bittersweet milk chocolate flavors, light vanilla and sweet coffee. Awesome stuff!
Willimantic S.W.A.K. Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Willimantic Brewing Company;From the tap at the brewery. Very very delicious with a thick dark brown color. The smell is of strong vanilla, but not much more. At first taste, there is a lot of vanilla flavor, but not too much. There is also hints of coffee and maple syrup.
Willimantic S.W.A.K. Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Willimantic Brewing Company;Poured from a 64oz growler, opaque black, small thick dark tan head. Aroma is strong dark coffee, sweet vanilla, milk chocolate, burnt grass, and toffee. Starts sweet, with caramel, toffee, chocolate and vanilla, followed by a mix of vanilla extract, dark roast coffee, and dark chocolate. Smoky roasty bitter coffee and sweet vanilla intermingle throughout the experience, and are very well balanced with each other. Finishes slightly dry, with lingering coffee and vanilla. Very nice beer, one of my favorite non-IPAs from Willimantic Brewing.
Willimantic S.W.A.K. Stout;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Willimantic Brewing Company;Pours brown with a tan head. Smells of vanilla, chocolate and earthy with some peppery splashes. Tastes of vanilla which almost smacks you in the face before giving way to some chocolatey undertones. A little over the top on the sweetness even for the style.

Willimantic Most Wanted IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a cloudy brown with a very small head. Aroma of resiny hops, grassy hops, and caramel malt. Flavor of nice caramel malts well-balanced with a bitter, hoppy finish. Solid IPA, although of course less emphasis on the hops vs. the malt. My favorite Willimantic offering so far. 7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)
Willimantic Most Wanted IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub. Aroma of nuts, molasses, citrus, pine, lots of lime and earth kicking in. Flavor quite balanced with moderate-big citrus bitterness and moderate-big nougat maltiness. Medium bodied, silky smooth mouthfeel, quite drinkable. Very unique for the style, which at first had me questioning it, but grew on me very much.
Willimantic Most Wanted IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Cask at the brewpub. Hazy orange brown body - dark for the style. Small off white head. Nose is candylike orange and earthy. A light woody note. Big malty flavors offset well by a spicy orange - very bitter, but soft, muted. A light pine is noticed. Whopper of a finish, bitter orange rind that attacks the sides of the tongue and won’t let go. Satiny body, slightly oily. Wow!
Willimantic Most Wanted IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;(Cask) Cloudy dark orange body with lots of yeast chunks, small white head with big bubbles. Orange and forest aroma. Filthy earthy hops abound. The rich yeasts are nearly a meal in themselves. Tasty dirty malts that felt like freshly ripped tree bark. Orange skins, citrus and some berries in hops oil. That is one dirty muddy ugly filthy mean IPA, inimitable, I loved it! Most Wanted IPA by glouglouburp, pint or glass, $5 + tip rewards if captured fresh.
Willimantic Most Wanted IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;"Any first impressions? -A frothy cask head stands over the murky amber/brown. -Rhubarb, pine needles, and faint strawberry fruitiness delightfully play with oranges. -The same iconoclastic fruitiness is found in the flavor profile, as bark and tree resins extract mild tartness, as well as bitterness. -The soft carbonation and well-extracted maltiness make this nourishing and quenching all at once. What if you dig deeper? -An earthy, yeasty presence is brought forth by the obvious flocculation, which could probably scare most macro drinkers. -The oily maltiness offers more body than flavor, and this doesn’t bother me one bit in this case. -This unusual personality is entrancing, and the cask format very fitting; these guys can’t brew a bad IPA. On cask at the brewpub."
Willimantic Most Wanted IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;@ Brewpub. Ok nose, sweet. citrusy orange. Hazy brownish orange color, small head with good lacing.

Willimantic Most Wanted IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Murky iced tea appearance. Tan head. Thick, rich, oily. Low carbonation. Sweet malts. Intense spruce and grapefruit rind hops. Outstandingly numbing.
Willimantic VEG IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;pint at willibrew, Finally get to try the VEG IPA. It does have a strong grapefruit flavor. Much more on the flavor than the aroma. Bitter finish, good mouthfeel and body, the right amount for a seriously hop forward IPA
Willimantic VEG IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Nice IPA from willibrew. A lot of citrus rind as well as a dank resiny pine hop as well. The malts are very mild with some white bread and biscuits. The finish is mildly bitter and pleasant. I like this.
Willimantic VEG IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap in a pint glass: Pours amber with a thin white head. Aroma is grapefruit, citrus, resin, and malt. Medium body, dry finish, easy to quaff. Taste is not what it was last year, they didn’t add enough hops or something. Lacking the serious citrus punch, mostly a mild pine hop taste. Still good, but not great like it was last year. Oh well. Still a solid IPA
Willimantic VEG IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Draft at the source. Clear gold color, bright white edge head. Aroma of grapefruit and pineapple. Taste is grapefruit, tropical fruit. Very nice.
Willimantic VEG IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Tap. Light caramel for the malt, heavy grapefruit and flowers for the hops, moderate soap for the yeast, with hints of date and pepper. Head is small, frothy, white with good but thin lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is hazy light amber/orange. Flavor starts lightly sweet and acidic, then finishes moderately acidic and heavily bitter. Palate is medium, oily with a lively carbonation and avery drying finish. Not a big malt presence in this IPA, but the way the flavor amplifies for each sip and the citrus-y hops really does it for me.
Willimantic VEG IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Growler shared by Miketd. Thanks Mike! Pours copper color with off white head. Aroma is a nice grapefruit, bitter, and flowery. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor follows the nose and has a perfect balance of bitterness, grapefruit appeal, some rind, and finishes semi dry. A touch of caramel and maybe some oxidation, but does not distract from the drinkability and enjoyment of this beverage. Thanks again Mike!
Willimantic VEG IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;(growler) Small beige head atop cloudy dark amber body. Aroma is medium sweet, orange, some grapefruit, light bread/caramel. Taste is medium sweet, orange/grapefruit, light caramel. Very flavorful, and solid bitterness, but doesn’t seem on the high end in IBUs. Medium body, some resin.
Willimantic VEG IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Pours copper with a thin white head. Smells of citrus and dry hops. Tastes citrussy and spicy with a slightly bitter finish.
Willimantic VEG IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;This beer was very drinkable but also snuck up on me and knocked me out. Pours from the growler a hazy orange, amber color with a soapy white head. Aroma is all citrus, orange and grapefruit mostly. Flavor was more of the same, flowers, citrus but also some nice malt anchoring the back. Finish is lasting bitterness and slightly thick on the tongue. I enjoyed drinking this.
Willimantic VEG IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Hazy yellow/amber with a white head. Wow, that’s a big nose - very citrusy, grapefruit and orange, some peach and sweet caramel. Some parfumey floral notes come out as it warms a bit. Big grapefruit zest bitter flavor, floral behind that. a bit of pine. All that, and the caramel malt behind it still will not go quietly - it’s sweetness backs the hop assault with aplomb. Mildly dry grapefruit and pine finish. Nice lace, medium bodied. Seems far bigger than it is. Amazing beer!
Gordon Biersch Premium Light;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);"""Tap. SF. From notes. Pretty much as expected. Passable straw yellow beer, hay, corn and light hops. Nothing to get excited about or be offended by. Hit the spot with a meal, but that’s about it."""
Gordon Biersch Premium Light;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Bottle: Pale straw, large fluffy white head, decent lacing, lively carbonation. &nbsp Pale malt nose, otherwise fairly non-descript. &nbsp Slightly sweetned grassy malts to start. &nbsp Tiz actually fairly clean, and even a bit thick. &nbsp Seems partially like a wheat ale. &nbsp Very slight touch of cereal and/or adjuncts at the finish, remaining slightly sweet. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate. &nbsp Better than expected.
Gordon Biersch Premium Light;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Bought as part of a Gordon Biersch pack. Horrid. We had trouble drinking it especially when you had the opportunity to drink the other ones. Very flat with no flavor. Do not try.
Gordon Biersch Premium Light;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);12oz bottle poured a clear yellow/gold color with a decent white head. Aroma was basic with some caramel breadiness. Taste was light bodied and easy drinking like a light lager should be. Nothing stands out to make it special, but still should have a higher rating than 11.
Gordon Biersch Premium Light;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);The body’s a light gold in color and it had a small fizzy head until seconds after the pour. The aroma is bready with some corn and a very faint floral hopping. Kinda sorta watery. Dead flavoring, just a bit of corn bread sweetness and a tinny bitterness. Still, better than the typical BMC. Belmont Party Supply, Dayton, OH
Gordon Biersch Premium Light;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);"Single bottle, $1.20 from Wine Vault, Columbus, OH. Shaker. Golden; dishsoap head becomes a small ring. Aroma just barely floral with a wee bit of malt and caramel. Flavor is kind of flat and exudes a cardboard vibe; just barely some bitterness. On the verge of watery. One of the better self-classified ""light"" beers I’ve had."
Gordon Biersch Premium Light;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);12 oz bottle. Pale yellow not much head. Aromas wrere classic PL and not much of that either. Flavors were light and watery. Not very exciting
Gordon Biersch Premium Light;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);(12 oz bottle, Bottled On 18-Sep-05: BevMo in La Jolla, CA) Yeah, a little old, but does a few months really matter with this beer? I’ve chilled it down to the point where ice crystals are beginning to form, but despite numbing my tongue, this beer still tastes unpleasant. Sweet honey and corn husks to start, but strong cardboard and wood dominating the finish. I don’t want to find out what this will taste like when the beer warms up a bit, so I’ll get this rating over with as quickly as possible. Sweet honey and soggy paper in the nose. Light bodied with average carbonation, but the cardboard gives this beer a stale mouthfeel. Medium-straw in color and slightly cloudy in appearance. Smallish, white head could be smaller than usual because I’ve chilled this thing down so much. But it fades to a small ring and leaves no lacing on the glass. I bought a sixer of this on mega-sale expecting to send some out as throwaway bonus beers to the ratings whores, but that wouldn’t be very nice of me. So not only is this a drain pour, it’s SIX drain pours! Probably better on tap, not that I plan to find out.
Gordon Biersch Premium Light;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Virtually no aroma and a quickly dissipating head. Very thin yellow body and too much carbonation.
Gordon Biersch Premium Light;San Jose, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Sampler. Very light beer. Almost water. Almost no head to speak of. Light malt flaver with no aroma to speak of really. Could call it a piss color. And end with a sour after taste.
