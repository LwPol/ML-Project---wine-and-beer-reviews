Tucks Gluteus Maximus;Portland                ,Oregon    ,United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Tuck's Brewery;2005’s: With a prominent alcohol nose                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,this beer poured beautifully and presented a gray                                                          ,concentrated two-finger head and a incisive chestnut hue. Pine and roasted malt were present in the finish as well as carmelly brown sugar gusto. This beer sat very well with me.

Big Horn Winter Solstice Ale;Lakewood         ,Washington,United States;Porter;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Very dark in color (mostly brown) with a light-tan head that was very nitro-esque (I forgot to ask). Creamy texture                                                                                                                                 ,too. Wonderful notes of freshly roasted coffee and spicy wood. Sweet chocolate base in the malts. Very mild,if any                                                                                                                                                                            ,spices in the beer. Mostly roasted and warming flavors/sensations. Decent beer,but alcohol overpowered the mild-mannered malts and hops.
Copper Tank Big O Stout;Austin                ,Texas     ,United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Copper Tank Brewing Co.;Tap. Near-opaque black w/mahogany at edges. Average head that dissipated quickly.

Lovejoys Folsom Prison Blueberry Porter;Austin,Texas     ,United States;Porter;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;"Had on tap at the brewpub in Austin. What were they thinking? I get the joke - this is supposd to be like the ""hooch"" that inmates make in their toilet. Well, other than not being blue, it is not far from it. Pours a dark ruby red with no real head or lacing. Aroma has some blueberry accents of course, not too natural-like. Flavor is very sweet and fruity and not in a good way, no porter-like qualities to this one. Mouthfeel - well, I was able to drink the whole point so it must have been all right. Bad experiment."
Lovejoys Folsom Prison Blueberry Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Tap...oh, my. The level of putridity of this beer is freakin' horrible! Minimal blueberry flavor of any kind. Absolutely nasty finish, that lingers unlike anything I've had before. Sick.
Lovejoys Oompah Fest of October Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;on tap at gabf. The promising name does not quite pay off when it comes to the palate, which is far thinner than most chocolate. It tastes like a collision between a chocolate milk truck and a light lager. The good part of the collision is the combination of milky chocolate and hops, the confusing part is the strangely thin palate and yoohoo aftertaste.
Lovejoys Oompah Fest of October Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Tap. Passable. Murky amber, curiously thick mouthfeel. Citric and hoppy flavors, especially toward the finish. Prominent orangs flavor.
Bitter End Monkadelic Belgian Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Tap at Bitter End. Murky yellow color with a white head. Aroma was fruity and yeasty. Tasted like some apple, sharp wheat, and some tropical fruit. Had a kin dof funkiness to the aftertaste that I was not fond of. Aside from that, this was not bad.
Bitter End Monkadelic Belgian Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Had on tap at the brewpub in Austin. Pours a bright translucent orange with a light white head, good lacing. Has a bit of a floral-like aroma with some strong yeasty notes.The flavor has some of the same qualities with some added bubble gum and candied sugar notes to add to the mix. Mouthfeel is fairly thick, does not distract with spritziness. An overall solid effort from the folks at BE.
Bitter End Monkadelic Belgian Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Slightly murky gold and orange color. Tart, spicy with wheat and hay flavors... creamy yeast flavors as well. Salty, like the vaporizer, with some light citrus and milk flavors. Strong, but not devastatingly good. Floral nose.
Bitter End Monkadelic Belgian Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Back on tap! It pours a cloudy orange with a nice creamy head and great lacing. Nice phenolic and spicy nose. Flavors of apple, malt, and a little banana at the end. Creamy texture. Gets better as it warm. Great beer.
Bitter End Monkadelic Belgian Pale Ale;Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Tap. Pale-amber. A certain bland tartness lingers in this beer from start to finish, kind of like granny smith apple extract with some young malts mixed in, and a hint of underripe bananas. Drinkable bit BE has better beers than this. An interesting experiment. Lingering and slightly sweet aftertaste, especially as it warms.
Bitter End Chewbocka;Austin, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;FYI - this is more a note for myself and/or a cautionary tale for others - be careful attempting to grasp the flavors of a beer like this once having sampled an excellent IPA just prior. Can you say clash? I think you can. I could taste the flavors in it, but they came across much like the St. Arnolds Bock does to me - a lager in ale clothing. This I believe to be a truer bock, but adulterated by none other than myself. I hope to be smarter about it if I’m given another chance.
Bitter End Chewbocka;Austin, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Tap. Dark brown, super-malted, choclatey. Seemingly about halfway in between a bock and dopplebock. I'd have loved this if only the mouthfeel were a bit firmer. Not the same malts characteristic of most BE brews - wisely so, it would clash with a bock style. I couldn't decide if I like this or not for a while, but in the end it gets a thumbs-up.

Aromas intensos de cítricos, de pomelo en la nariz, junto con algunos toques de resina de pino. Un montón de malta dulce, caramelo en la nariz.

Hay un poco de saltos cítricos persistentes en el final. el aroma de esta cerveza es genial y el alcohol está bien recóndito. Me alegro de que el sabor no sea tan amargo como se podría esperar de los aromas del lúpulo. Maravillosa cerveza.

Rock Bottom San Jose Blitzen Ale;Campbell, California, United States;Tripel;Rock Bottom Campbell (San Jose);Light orange pour with a white head. Very sugary aroma. Some banana, orange, apple, and pear fruitiness, too. Spice notes of clove and white pepper. A bit cidery and alcoholic. There’s a strong cider character to the flavor too. Lots of sugar and fruit. Banana, pear, and apple are prominent. Quite a bit of alcohol, particularly as it warms.
Rock Bottom San Jose Blitzen Ale;Campbell, California, United States;Tripel;Rock Bottom Campbell (San Jose);Growler from the brewbup. Hazy gold with a small head that doesn’t really last. I might need to pick up the bottle-conditioned swingtops that come out next week to remedy this... The aroma has a hint of honey-ish malty sweetness and candi sugar, with a nice belgian yeast profile that has a hint of bubblegum, some clove and cinnamon, apple, and pear, and a hint of spicy hops. The flavor is leaning toward sweet, with a yeasty spice and simple pale malt. There is also a touch of spicy hops with light bitterness, and some banana and pear. Medium bodied wit medium carbonation. The body is where I would hit this the most as far as style goes, being a little too heavy and not carbonated enough. The finish is a little sweeter than I would like, but is certainly not near the top of offenders as far as American brewpubs are concerned. A pretty good tripel, but a growler is not the best vessel for the style.
Rock Bottom San Jose Blitzen Ale;Campbell, California, United States;Tripel;Rock Bottom Campbell (San Jose);Poured from growler, thanks to SamGamgee. Pale golden with minimal white head. Nose of candy and fruit, mostly ripe pear and apple. Medium bodied, smooth tasting, overall a good American tripple.

Rock Bottom San Jose Blitzen Ale;Campbell, California, United States;Tripel;Rock Bottom Campbell (San Jose);Rock Botton- San Jose, CA: It actually looks like crystalized honey in the glass. Super wheaty aroma with banana overtones. Watery, but with a fruity, wheaty flavor. Not a lot of body to it though, unfortunately. VERY watery-- no, TOO watery. If I could have given Palate a zero I would have.

Three Coins Riva Witbier;Meegoda, Sri Lanka;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Millers Brewery;Moderately spicy aroma. Cloudy light yellow colour with little floaties, high carbonation and small head.

Has a sweet dark caramel and maple nose with nutty coffee roast.

Slightly roasted, slightly sugary aroma. Initial taste was of roasted malts, the finish brings the maple which is pleasant and not overpowering.

Gabriels Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Darkest brown color, pretty fresh bubbly head, light carbonation, appropriate. Roasts, medium body, easy drinker. Malty charcoal-y taste. Good profile, easy to like. Lacks a little complexity, still has a good bite.
Gabriels Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;On tap at Gabriel’s Gate in Buffalo. I never knew that they had a house beer, even if it is contract-brewed. Regardless, I was impressed with this. Poured a dark opaque brown. Smelled strongly of coffee and hazelnut....strong coffee scent. Flavor was similar, smooth and sweet throughout. Not much bitterness. I really enjoyed this, I wouldn’t mind drinking it all night.
Gabriels Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;2010 Autumn Festival of Ales. Nice brown pour. Nutty malty aroma. The flavor was of toasted nutty malts with a slight hop bite.

Gabriels Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;translucent dark brown with little/no head. thin body with chocolate/coffee notes, light malt and a mild bitter. nice tight carbonation. the light body makes it a decent session beer and a nice accompaniment to the wings. its nothing to write home about (the flavor isn’t horrible complex and the palate is slightly watery) but it beats the sierra and blue moon alternatives. i’ll definitely order another my next time in.

Nose is roasty with maybe a hint of malty-caramel in there. Start is very smoky/dusky tasting with a finish that has hints of chocolate and caramel. Smooth. The smokiness kills this beer.
De Hemel Nieuw Ligt Grand Cru;Nijmegen, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stadsbrouwerij De Hemel;Bottled, 330ml Vintage 2005 from The Cracked Kettle Bottle Shop, Amsterdam, Netherlands. Murky copper brown with hardly any head. Unfortunately this had lost condition during the ageing. Extremely booy in character, malt brandy, plummy alcohol, quite fiery. Heavy on the palate, nasal, some roastiness, nutty hints. A touch disappointing.
De Hemel Nieuw Ligt Grand Cru;Nijmegen, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stadsbrouwerij De Hemel;Bottle, 11 years past the BBD. Pours cloudy copper brown with very small off-white head. Clear aroma of Belgian yeast, malt and caramel, with fruity notes and touches of hops. Sweetish flavour of yeast and caramel malt, with dusty notes and touches of fruit and roast. Dusty and caramellish aftertaste with estery notes. A nice one.
De Hemel Nieuw Ligt Grand Cru;Nijmegen, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stadsbrouwerij De Hemel;Unquantified bottle at Gyhallmanti’s, bougt at de Bierbrigadier, Nijmegen. Appearance: reddish brown with almost no head. Aroma: brown sugar, grenadine, spice, maybe some bayleaf. Taste: high sweetness and medium bitterness. Notes of brown sugar, some spice, red fruits, grenadine. Palate: medium to full bodied, sticky oily texture and soft carbonation. Overall: not the typical barleywine. Very sugarry. This might indeed be better in 2020, because this is very sugarry atm. Not my favorite barleywine, for sure. Disappointed
De Hemel Nieuw Ligt Grand Cru;Nijmegen, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stadsbrouwerij De Hemel;Unquantified bottle split with SimonBlok vintage 2015. Pours a slight hazy amber red colour with a thin head. Aroma of flowers, sudocream, caramalt, slight herbs, slight spices. Taste is full sweet, light bitter with a moderate dry finish.

De Hemel Nieuw Ligt Grand Cru;Nijmegen, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stadsbrouwerij De Hemel;375 ml bottle (?) A long forgotten bottle from the cellar surfaced while packing away everything else. Despite its age this has held up surprisingly well. That said if you happen to be waiting for it to hit 15 or 20 years I would recommend cracking it open now. AROMA / APPEARANCE Sherry, caramel, and malt compete for attention in a warm mellow profile. The creamy caramel base pours with little head retention. FLAVOR / PALATE Sherry and caramel aspects stand out the most though the richness surely contains a little bit of something for everyone. The slow building finish takes a while to reach its peak. From there it merely becomes an enjoyable and laid back experience. If you're lucky enough to stumble across a vintage bottle treat yourself to a beer that can hold up to age.

De Hemel Nieuw Ligt Grand Cru;Nijmegen, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stadsbrouwerij De Hemel;Bottle from Bierkoning, thanks Eddan. Amber with a small head. Sweetish with malt, dried fruit, brandy, caramel and some warming alcohol. The body was full and the finish long.
De Hemel Nieuw Ligt Grand Cru;Nijmegen, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stadsbrouwerij De Hemel;"Bottle from 2012 (""around 2017 at its peak""). Nearly clear dark amber pour, with hardly any head, and some floating particles. Aroma is full, red fruits, raisin, porto. Taste also fruity, sugary, more than medium sweet, light soury. Fullbodied, alcoholic; very low carbo, oily mouthfeel. Of course this is a nice sensation, but actually I expected more richness (just like with the normal Nieuw Ligt); the sugary element also makes it flat."
De Hemel Nieuw Ligt Grand Cru;Nijmegen, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stadsbrouwerij De Hemel;On tap at the brewpub. Limpid copper body with a thick, lasting, off-white foamy head. Well balanced malty/hoppy aroma with barley sugar and woody hints. Alcohol is well hidden. Its good malty/hoppy taste carries fruity, woody, and spicy notes. Alcohol is still subtle. Ends with a moderately warming bittersweet finish. Enjoyable.

Fuglsang Jule Hvidtøl;Haderslev, Denmark;Traditional Ale - Other;Bryggeriet S.C. Fuglsang;Bottle. Looking quite goreous in the glass, with its dense two-finger light tan head over a next to black body. Some curtains. The aroma is more on the diacetyl side than on the ryebread and dark sugar side. Some caramel sauce in the back. It’s super sweet and sticky on the palate, soft and well carbonated. Dark sugar, caramel, blue plums and prunes, with some diacetyl hints. Well, there’s something good going on here, but it’s sure not a drink I could have a bottle on my own of. 140815

Big yellowish head that dissipates quickly. Smells is a little like yoghurt and wild strawberries and raisins - I am not sure that’s how it’s supposed to be. However, I cannot say it is unpleasant. In fact the smell reminds me of Sherry or Madeira wine. Taste is only lightly bitter, with a sour touch that seems to underline the fruity aroma. Caramel and toasted aroma from the malts is present as well, along with a slightly metallic taste. Light body, a little too thin maybe. Overall, it probably depends on my mood whether I like this beer or not. I remember ordering it again when I tried it the first time. This time, one bottle is definitely enough for me!

Pleasant enough with hints of chocolate, but lacks a crisp edge to clean it up, finishing with damp, mouldy leaves. [3.0] Dec, 2009 JDW, Rochester. Ooooo - very nice. Served a little warmer than has been the recent fashion, this is a creamy, sweet, full bodied and very tasty ale. The very open malt start soon transfers into a dusty and widespread hop finish. Very drinkable, with a lingering bitter finish. The start is more pleasant than the end. This promises much, but fails to deliver. [3.0]
Rectory Christmas Cheer;Streat, East Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rectory Ales;The idea of a brewery run by a man of god is interesting. One might expect the Christmas beer to be particularly carefully made. However, this was another respectable, but unexciting, malty bitter that was not very well balanced. To my mind, a session bitter should be an undemanding beer that you can sit in a pub drinking all night with your mates, without analysing it too much (or falling over). Such beers need more bite and less sweet malt than this one has. Whilst it would be OK for a pint or two, it would soon get too cloying for me. Cask, Pigs Ear Beer Fest, East London, December 2003.
Kraftbrau English X-mas Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - English;Kraftbrau Brewery;Came out today December 8, 2003. Sampled at the brewery. The beer was undercarbonated but I was warned that it needed to sit a couple of days to reach the appropriate level of carbonation so I wont rate against the beer for that. Nice ruby black color to the beer. I was surprised by how mellow this beer was for a winter brew. Chocolatey, very mild, dry, smooth, slight bitterness. Very mellow flavors. It coats your mouth, great mouthfeel. Attacks the sinuses. The alcohol content was a guess at the time so I don't know actual content. Very nice beer.

Pleasant refreshing aroma - citrus with hints of bread and grass. Light body, medium carbonation. Nice light malt with slight sweetness and bready hints. Some nice hoppy bitterness appears in mid palate and stays around for long finish. I usually find blondes lacking flavour but this is pretty tasty. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Copper Dragon Golden Pippin;Keighley, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Copper Dragon Brewery (prev Greyhawk);Pint at the Dun Cow, Durham. Very pale gold with a rising curtain of cloudy bubbles and a thin, frothy white head. Barely any aroma, but what little there is is striking mostly as hay. Very watery, faintly bitter hoppy flavour. Akin to a handful of hay in a glass of water.

Beer Engine Double Crossover;Exeter, Devon, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Beer Engine;A rather malty bitter. Mid amber colour and fairly full bodied. Quite acceptable, but nothing special. Not really to my taste – I prefer a healthier ration of bittering hops in my bitter. Cask, Pigs Ear Beer Fest, East London, December 2003
BJ's Pure Devotion Abbey Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Tripel;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;This beer was sampled at the San Diego Strong Ale Festival. It poured a cloudy orange color with a fairly thick, yet creamy tanned and peachy head. The aroma was definitely peachy with hints of wood, banana, and a slight hint of orange. The taste definitely hints at heavy belgian yeastiness and for whatever reason it has a vanilla/cinammon stick appeal to it. It was pretty light on the yeasties as I got into the beer. Definite banana lingered in the taste and aftertaste with the typical dry ending. I got some definite grapefruits in the ending there. It was lightly carbonated, which was a nice change for those usually heavily carbonated belgians. Overall this was very tasty!
BJ's Pure Devotion Abbey Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Tripel;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Medium brown color. Smallish head. Aroma is malty, bready, and spicy with a hint of banana and orange. A medium bodied abbey ale. Malts are fruity and sweet. Spicy and slightly sweet. Nice balance between sweet and spice. Very smooth taste. There is a touch of alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
BJ's Pure Devotion Abbey Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Tripel;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;big head on a cloudy orangish amber body..a lacy head indeed of tainted peachy white colors...yeasty aroma with banana bread and citrus tones..soft delicate tongue touches...soft flowery flavors of yeast and sweetness..like silky dude, silky.
BJ's Pure Devotion Abbey Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Tripel;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Had on tap at San Diego Strong Ale Festival, Pizza Port, Carlsbad on December 6, 2003 This Abbey Ale has a good head with a lot of carbonation. The beer has a cloudy brown/amber appearance and very good lacing to it. The aroma is of malt and spices and the flavor is very strong - similar to your standard tripel. Enjoyable, slight sweetness.
Rock Bottom San Diego Frostys Imperial Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rock Bottom San Diego;This beer was sampled at the San Diego Strong Ale Festival. I wasnt expecting all too much when i went up for this sample, and well, I got exactly what i expected. It pours a black and headless creature with a clean clear appearance. The aroma was pretty weak...i could gather some nice coffee and stout-like maltiness which is standard with any stout, but nothing that really stood out and grabbed me. The beer itself began and ended fairly weakly aside from that astringent throat burning alcohol, which is disappointing for a 9.2% ABV beer. I gathered a little woody taste mixed in with a brandy ageness to it. No carbonation to speak of...but this strange woody water flavor..very hard to describe. Like grabbing an off brand spiked mocha! Not really worth the ticket.
Rock Bottom San Diego Frostys Imperial Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rock Bottom San Diego;dark but letting in streaks of red..a foamy tan head lay atop...fruits & fudge aroma with big bourbon notes...big bourbon character with some cocoa flavors and heating alcohol...pretty thin and weak though with no real body...oh well.
Rock Bottom San Diego Frostys Imperial Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rock Bottom San Diego;Well, when i saw imperial stout, i tought this would be great, but it sucked. It tasted exactly like a mixture of brandy, VO, and water. This tastes more like a foul flavored oatmeal, than an imperial.
Rock Bottom San Diego Frostys Imperial Stout;San Diego, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rock Bottom San Diego;Had on tap at the San Diego Strong Ale Festival at Pizza Port, Carlsbad on December 6, 2003 Not too much to differentiate this stout from the basic stouts found elsewhere. Pours dark brown with no head. Aroma is of strong coffee, a bit of chocloate. Flavor is chocolate and coffee - slightly sweet, but just nothing to differentiate it from the other Imperials out there.
La Jolla Brewhouse Santa Costeleta Belgian Style Tripel;La Jolla, California, United States;Tripel;La Jolla Brewhouse;Strong Ale '03. Oh, I wanted to love this beer but couldn't quite pull the trigger. Straw yellow with yeatsy floral aroma on which sat a thin head. Sweet finish.
La Jolla Brewhouse Santa Costeleta Belgian Style Tripel;La Jolla, California, United States;Tripel;La Jolla Brewhouse;Light orange color. Small head. Aroma is orange, grape and other fruits.

Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
La Jolla Brewhouse Santa Costeleta Belgian Style Tripel;La Jolla, California, United States;Tripel;La Jolla Brewhouse;clear and golden with a white head...grapey hop aroma (where's the yeast, mr. trippel?)..Very white grapey aroma..spicy, almost yeasty flavor profile..almost like a blend of a CA pale ale & and a belgian blonde ale..clean, crisp, with a tad of white wine tartness...not as yeasty as a trippel usually is.
La Jolla Brewhouse Santa Costeleta Belgian Style Tripel;La Jolla, California, United States;Tripel;La Jolla Brewhouse;Had on tap at San Diego Strong Ale Festival at Pizza Port, Carlsbad on December 6, 2003 This was my first beer of the day and I just decided to try it because it was hand written on the list of beers, a late addition. The tripel poured with an amber color and no head or lacing. The aroma was weak, but could definitely smell some malts. The taste was good, a pleasant surprise with a malty, sweet flavoring, easy to drink, no real aftertaste. A watery complexity, but nothing that knocked my socks off. A fine entry for this new brewery.

La Jolla Brewhouse Gonzo Amber Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;La Jolla Brewhouse;"(Draft: Beach House Brewery in La Jolla, CA) Malty and sugary sweet, with very little hops and only a mild bitterness, so this is very much a sweet malt dominated beer; The first few sips are pretty decent, but then the sugary flavor really starts to wear on the palate, which ends up being slightly sticky; The nose is very mild, perhaps malty, but too light to really register; Amber in color; Huge, frothy tan head lasts a long time and leaves large patches of lacing; Would be a pretty good, enjoyable beer if it wasn’t so sugary sweet"
La Jolla Brewhouse Belgian Wheat;La Jolla, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Jolla Brewhouse;On-tap at the brewpub. Pours cloudy, straw yellow with a crisp white head.

La Jolla Brewhouse Belgian Wheat;La Jolla, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Jolla Brewhouse;On tap @ Hamilton’s where it was being called Lil’ Towhead. Pours opaque golden straw with lasting bright white head. The aroma is lemon tartness followed by mild bubble gum and faint malt sweetness. The taste begins sweet before mild lemon tartness and bubble gum well up and dominate the flavor all the way into the finish. The sweetness does show up from time to time threatening to over sweeten the experience but never really does. Nice hot weather brew.
La Jolla Brewhouse Belgian Wheat;La Jolla, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Jolla Brewhouse;On tap at brewery. Closer to a hefe than a witbier. Cloudy yellow with almost no head. Banana bread aroma and taste with a good bready finish and clove notes.
La Jolla Brewhouse Belgian Wheat;La Jolla, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Jolla Brewhouse;Draught at the Brewpub Hazy blonde color, spicy esters in the nose, lots of hops and lemon notes. Rounded wheat flavor, not too bad.
La Jolla Brewhouse Belgian Wheat;La Jolla, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Jolla Brewhouse;(Draft: Beach House Brewery in La Jolla, CA) This is a pretty awful beer. There’s very little in the way of aroma to this beer, only just a hint of spice. Likewise, the flavor is very light, but almost entirely spices like coriander. The spice is strongest and most dominant in the unpleasant finish where the spice is sharp, tangy and bitter like ginger. The body is damn light. Pale yellow in color and cloudy, and it has a somewhat olive grey hue to it. Pours with very little head, but just a small rim around the glass. Really, I have nothing positive to say about this beer. Needs more wheat flavor and a more refined touch with the spices.
La Jolla Brewhouse Brown Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Brown Ale;La Jolla Brewhouse;Draught at the brewpub. No suprises here. Everything seemed pretty typical for you run of the mill brown ale. Hazy brown color with off white head. Aroma and flavor are nutty and roasty, but not overly so. There is a touch of hop aroma. Dry and slightly bitter at the end.
La Jolla Brewhouse Brown Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Brown Ale;La Jolla Brewhouse;(Draft: La Jolla Brewhouse in La Jolla, CA) Lightly caramely, somewhat malty, a bit nutty with moderate roast. It’s not very sweet and hoppy bitterness is fairly mild as well. Nutty, lightly roasty nose. Dark auburn/brown color with some haze, but I can still see through the beer. Small off-white head diminishes to a ring. Overall, not really all that great a beer, but it’s not unpleasant either. It’s just a standard brown ale.
La Jolla Brewhouse Brown Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Brown Ale;La Jolla Brewhouse;Draught at the Brewpub: Mahogany color, nose of crisp hops and a bit of bark. IPAish in character, a bit bitter and sweet in the tail with some other caramel notes. The finish is dry and unbalanced. Just another ho-hum beer from this place. Oh, did I mention they have a hip-hop DJ at the moment?
La Jolla Brewhouse Brown Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Brown Ale;La Jolla Brewhouse;Draft at brewpub. Clear, dark brown with mahogany highlights and a tannish head - this is the best part of the brew. Somewhat nutty, roasty aroma. Decent roasty malt flavor, nice bitterness but a little harsh overall.

La Jolla Brewhouse Pale Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;La Jolla Brewhouse;On tap at the brewhouse. Clear yellow/amber pour, white head. Malt, grain, hops, some citrus and pine. To thin in my oppinion for a pale ale.
La Jolla Brewhouse Pale Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;La Jolla Brewhouse;On tap @ the La Jolla Brew House brewpub. Pours with a slight haze, ice cold, copper with above average carbonation creating a lasting – regenerating off white head and decent lacing. Mild aroma hinting at sweet malts and a vague hoppiness. Served too darn cold really. The taste has a very nice up front grapefruit hop bitterness that has faint off note due to the serving temperature. The malts build to something just noticeable toward the finish.

La Jolla Brewhouse Pale Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;La Jolla Brewhouse;28-Apr-06 (Draft: La Jolla Brewhouse in La Jolla, CA) The hops is fairly bitter, more piney than citrusy. Grainy malt base is fairly toasty but only mildly sweet. The dry, vegetal nose isn’t all that appealing to me. Medium-bodied, but the carbonation level is way too high -- it’s tough to drink this, but the loud belches are fun! Medium-dark amber in color and only slightly hazy. Average size head is off-white in color and settles to a wide ring. Some spiderweb lacing. Meh, not any more enjoyable than the first time I had it.07-Jul-04 (Draft: Beach House Brewery in La Jolla, CA) This medium bodied beer is a pretty bland hops-dominated west coast pale ale. It is hoppy, moderately bitter with some grapefruit, but unfortunately, also quite sweet. The mild nose is hoppy, sweet and moderately malty. Lazy light amber in color. Headless pour, but with a small off-white ring at the edge. (6, 3, 5, 3, 11 = 2.8)

Dent Wish Ewe Were Here;Dent, Cumbria, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Dent Brewery;"This appears to be one of the 12 monthly ""specials"" all brewed to 4.5% and also all sharing names that are awful puns on a sheepish theme (""BaaBaa of Seville"" is to my mind the most excruciating, but others push it close - check out the brewery website to see for yourself). Despite the terrible name, this is really quite a good beer. Another of those ubiquitous summer ales - pale in colour and refreshing. However, nothing really to set this one apart from others of the same ilk. Cask, Great British Beer Festival, August 2003."

21st Amendment Hendrik's Russian Imperial Espresso Stout;San Leandro, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;21st Amendment Brewery;Taken at the brewery tap on 5th Feb 2013: this 8.6% ABV version was on offer during ’Strong Beer Month’, so I thought it only right to try one (along with the other 8 beers and 1 cider). Black, going to dark, deep brown: the head a tanned foam. Coffee and dark chocolate taste and smell: not too ’in your face’, but very noticeable, even after a few ’heavy’ brews have been already been quaffed. Liquorice notes arrive once your senses take in the coffee and chocolate esters. Pleasant without blowing my socks off: neither rich nor creamy in the mouth, instead a mild hop bitterness takes over and that appears to thin out the body somewhat mid-mouthful. Interesting and different (for a visiting Brit).

Walking Man Knuckle Dragger;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Walking Man Brewing;Bronzed body with a decent, off-white head and some hop bubbles. A bit of an oxidated hop nose / steam beer aroma with some fruitiness. Oxidated body with some tannins. A bit of a cardboard finish.
Walking Man Knuckle Dragger;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Walking Man Brewing;Cask pint pour at special brews. Pours a dark copper color with a foam cask head. Very unique pale here, I’m my opinion. Sweet melon aroma. So much hop variety flavor. Soft, sweet fruit flavor with a bitter hop finish. Can’t quite describe what makes this so different, but I like what’s going on here. Solid stuff

Walking Man Knuckle Dragger;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Walking Man Brewing;First off, I am not an APA fan. They are essentially an IPA without the sweetness and backbone. Where’s the malt to balance out the massive hoppiness? Anyway, this beer has some fruity notes up front with a hint of malt...before the hops reach up and bitchslap you. All in all, for an APA, this is a pretty good offering.
Walking Man Knuckle Dragger;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Walking Man Brewing;"Had at the Walking Man Brewpub. Advertised ad ""aggressively hopped"" and the aroma complied. The rest of it was watery dishwater. Got slightly better as it warmed up."

Coastal Light Low Carb Lager;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);We Love this beer! We haven’t been able to buy it at Trader Joe’s. Where can we get it?
Coastal Light Low Carb Lager;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);"This beer is not the worst light i’ve had or the best. With that being said, i can begin to bash it. Fake aroma of corn and rice water. A fizzed head that dissolves quickly and leaves a somewhat gold beer behind. Fake flavor of rice and starchy corn. It does taste somewhat like a ""small beer"" but thats maybe cuz of the alcohol content. I do thank Firestone Walker for putting it out, beacuse not to many consider the light drinkers population."
Coastal Light Low Carb Lager;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Pale yellowy appearance, moderate carbonation, moderate head formation. Sweet malt and grain aroma, slightly grassy, mild hops. Very light in flavor, grainy, mild sweetness but dry. Aroma is a surprise, flavor is as crappy as you’d expect. Firestone’s a pretty good brewer, so I’m surprised they agreed to brew this, even without their name on it. Shouldn’t they be promoting good beer?
Coastal Light Low Carb Lager;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours a nice crisp looking gold color. Smells of hops, which was a surprise. Tastes kind of sweet with a sort of tea like aftertaste. Smooth and easy to drink alot better than Michelob Ultra, that’s not saying a whole lot but what do you want from this kind of fake beer.
Coastal Light Low Carb Lager;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Actually not that bad for a Low carb beer, to look at..typical macro yellow bubbly head. The smell is atrocious though..rotten potatoes and burnt grass..with some soap in the background. Thankfully the taste( lessness) was not as bad as the aroma, this is seltzer water with a splash of beer. Nasty on the palte..initially full of bubbles then a weird sticky nastiness in the back of the mouth. Like all low carb beers this is awful..a crime against hops and malt everywere.
Coastal Light Low Carb Lager;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle. Clear, yellow with a foamy white head - yech, looks a little too much like urine... Aroma is very mild, dominated by hops with a very light bready smell as well. Flavor is just plain bad, that is if you want to call it flavor - it's all bitter and astringent. This is what I imagine it might taste like if you took the water used for the 2nd rinsing of the fermenting tank of an SNPA or comparable, dry-hopped it, then fermented and bottled it again. Watery body and aggressive carbonation. Bleah...
Coastal Light Low Carb Lager;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);This beer is pretty much like every other low carb product i've tasted, just plain gross. It is slightly better then their pale ale, at least you can taste SOMETHING here. It pours very yellow with an almost nonexistant head. It's faint aroma is that of light malt, and it's flavor has a bit of an alcohol taste, and slightly salty. It's very fizzy like the pale ale, but a tad tastier. It's finish is short and metallic. I don't think i would drink this beer even if I was on a diet.
Coastal Light Low Carb Lager;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours clear yellow with a soapy white head. Little flavor at all. somewhat of a mettallic finish. drain pour
Coastal Light Low Carb Lager;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);The beer after departing the bottle is a transparent deep amber color with the head monstrous in size, semi-creamy in texture and the color a very light tan, lace is a thick patchy sheet upon the glass. Nose is all malt, lightly sweet and fresh, crisp, start is sweet, nicely malted, the top skeletal in feel to the palate. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hops pleasant and mild, the aftertaste quite dry, not as bad as I feared, not something I’ll ever drink again, but for those into “Light”, a decent beer.
Coastal Light Low Carb Lager;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle. A light yellow bordering on clear color with a big foamy white head. A dusty aroma with a light crisp (at least when it is cold) flavor. As it warms it faids into a cardboard musty flavor that shoud be left to those on a diet.
Coastal Light Pale Ale;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Thin boring grainy beer with some astringency. Grainy and overattenuated on the palate.
Coastal Light Pale Ale;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Abit more flavor than most low carb beers out there, but still bland. I would drink it though if I had too, just for the fact that it at least has a little flavor.
Coastal Light Pale Ale;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);The best low carb beer I’ve tasted. Much superior to Amstel Light orMiller Lite.
Coastal Light Pale Ale;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Awful and on tap. Watery yellow color. Unfinishable. What are they doing here? Astringency and sweet.
Coastal Light Pale Ale;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours amber in color. Aroma is hoppy and sweet. Slight hoppiness in the flavor. Basically tastes like a watered down APA. Much better than a macro low carb beer, but still it is fairly bland.
Coastal Light Pale Ale;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);My word , wonders never cease a low carb pale ale!..bought at Trader Joes. Pours a dark clear copper..with a huge frothy off white head, moderate carbonation. The aroma is very dull..some faint pils like hops and a sort of creamy smelling maltiness. taste is just plain nothing..slight hop..maybe a hint of malt sweetness..but its all buried by rampant carbonation. Not too good on the palte too watery and gassy. Its drinkable and it is probably the best low-carb beer I have had..but thats not saying much.
Coastal Light Pale Ale;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle. Pours clear amber-orange color with a moderate white head that left good lacing - so far so good. Aroma is faint at best, barely discernable malt and more robust hoppiness - reminds me more of a lager than a pale ale. Flavor is dry and weighted to the hops with a lingering bitter finish. Light body and good carbonation. Not bad, but not so good either. More than expected for a low-carb though.
Coastal Light Pale Ale;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Orange color. Small white foamy head. Aroma is slightly malty and touch citrusy. A light bodied “low carb” Pale Ale. Malts are mild and slightly nutty. Very little hop flavor, but what is there is, is slightly spicy. Lively carbonation and it does retain some beer like qualities but it is kind of thin and watery. If I was stuck drinking a low carb beer, I guess this one would be OK. Crisp and refreshing, with no obvious flavor defects. Mouthfeel is a touch thin. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Coastal Light Pale Ale;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);"Okay, so it's not the best Pale Ale I've ever had but it's definitely one I enjoyed. I think that because it's name has ""Low Carb"" in it, it gives off a negative connotation. However, I found it to be very smooth with great clairty/color. Pleasant aroma as well. I'd definitely have it again. By the way, for those Atkins followers, the carb count on this one is 5.4 per 12oz."
Coastal Light Pale Ale;Paso Robles, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);This beer didn't even come close to what I was expecting. I haven't tried any other low carb beers, so I was hoping this would be decent. My hopes were dashed. It is a liquidy amber color with a very faint smell of cereal, and the taste is like eating some shredded wheat with a little water. Blech!!

Phoenix Snowbound;Heywood, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Phoenix (Oak Brewing Co.);Perhaps drinking as the first snow of 2012 falls slides it a little. Standard yellow larger search, thinking head and whippy creamy mash nose. Hungry initial palate a slim Werthers vibe finishing an ineffectual hum. Nothing special, nothing too session unreasonable. (Cask, Bow Bar, Edinburgh (Winter Beer Festival))

Clear pale amber in colour with a thin white head. Slight hint of toffee in the short aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a weak digestive biscuit base with swee toffee notes present. Dry floral hops give a long bitter aftertaste with earthy notes. Finish is bitter sweet with malt just edging it. An ok session bitter but I would take T’Owd Tup any day!

Malt River Razz-Ma-Tazz Raspberry Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Malt River Brewing;This wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be. The raspberry flavor in it isn’t fake tasting, although it is a bit overwhelming.
Malt River Razz-Ma-Tazz Raspberry Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Malt River Brewing;Strong raspberry aroma, very pleasant. Golden color with white head. Taste suffers from pale lager blandness but has a nice raspberry character. Watery body.
Malt River Razz-Ma-Tazz Raspberry Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Malt River Brewing;Strong fruity flavor, of obvious rasperries due to the name. Has a fairly light body with a dry texture and a sweet finish.
Malt River Blonde Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Malt River Brewing;Has alot of cereal flavored thickness to it. Didn’t taste bad, but it wasn’t a great beer either.
Malt River Blonde Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Malt River Brewing;4 ounce sample. Banana citrus aroma with grassy notes and a bit of cereal in the nose. Hazy straw color with a small off-white head. Start is rather sour and slightly lactic. Fruity, cereal-like to finish. Just doesnt jive. Watery.
Malt River Blonde Ale;Latham, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Malt River Brewing;"Yellow appearance and a sour distasteful aroma. The beer itself had almost no taste at all. Reminded me of flavored sports water. What struck me the most was that most pale lagers I’ve had have more taste than this. What the hell were you guys thinking? ""Hey, let’s brew a beer with as few ingredients as possible!"" Jeez, friends don’t let friends brew drunk."
Watch City Zoks Baltic Porter;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Baltic;Watch City Brewing Co.;on tap-pours a tan head with black color. Aroma is dark malt. Taste is dark malt, roasty, licorice, alcohol. Full body. Nice. Occasional.
Watch City Zoks Baltic Porter;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Baltic;Watch City Brewing Co.;"Batch 2 draught, 4/21/06 at the brewpub in an oversized snifter. This batch is listed at 8.2% abv. Opaque or near opaque deep coal black body with a rocky, light-tan colored head that is fairly dense, but also very small and begins to fade to partial cover almost immediately. It is held there, with a ring to match, on the edge. Little to no lacing, unfortunately, probably due in part to the heavy black malt. Somewhat reserved, subtle nose nonetheless quickly expresses a broad range of dark malt character. As I see from Chris and Jeff’s ratings of the last batch, this one seems to be similar in that regard. Lightly singed wood, with debittered black malt dryness, burnt toast and some minor black pepper/cinnamon phenols. Vinousness is very controlled in the nose, only a light currant skin poignancy upon warming. Profound, crunchy black coffee, crusty brown bread and dark chocolate are all held together in a lightly lactic acid-meets-vanilla cream gracefulness that smooths out the roughness of the black malts and creates, overall, a very soft, chalky, dry aroma. However, as with Portsmouth’s recent Baltic Porter, I also find the black malts to be a little dull on the nose, holding back much of the sweetness and energy of the beer. I’d like to see some notes that Zywiec used to display (maple, toffee, creamy oats) as well as more dark fruits to really stretch the aroma and carry it farther. Plus, from a large snifter glass, fresh on draught, the aroma is not exactly strong. Moving to the flavor, I’m impressed with what Jeff calls a ""plastery"" yeast. That’s almost exactly how I would describe it (though I wouldnt have thought of nearly as good a way to describe it as that), with plenty of chalky smoothness on the palate, a strong sense of dry coffee, light anise and fresh cream all playing about in balance. The finish crackles with roast, cigars, brown bread, vanilla-flavored TUMS and short jabs of brightly flavored currants and dark grapes. I’m not kidding about the TUMS suggestion, it really feels as if there is Calcium in this thing, it’s got such a paste-like, chalky smoothness that soothes the palate. Perhaps a bit too heavy? It might serve to dull some of the brighter flavors; fruits, roast, hops, etc...What I don’t get from this batch is any strong toffee or nougat that Jeff reports from the last batch. In fact, it’s quite dry, with only some faint caramel and cream-like sugars. Though it did sweeten somewhat as it warmed. Carbonation is very low, alcohol is completely unapparent. The brewer said he didn’t think they would bottle any of this, and they arent selling it in growlers either, so get down to the brewery."
Watch City Zoks Baltic Porter;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Baltic;Watch City Brewing Co.;Bottle, from Brewpub. Good nose, Soy sauce, chocolate, peat, molasses, little birch or some kind of wood. Nice dark brownish black color. Little to no head. Bitter sweet flavors, Malty. Same as aromas, with licorace too. Thicker body, creamy oily mouthfeel, bitter sweet finish, leaves like a cocoa powder feeling on my tounge. Nice brew, I’m liking the Baltic porter catagory more and more.
Watch City Zoks Baltic Porter;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Baltic;Watch City Brewing Co.;"12/5/04. Poured out of 22 oz. bottle, shared with some random guy at the Pizza Port Strong Ale Fest in Carlsbad, CA 12/5/04. Holy shit. I just heard of this beer a couple days prior when TAR and cb rated it, and it escalated to the top of my ""must try"" list. Considering its relative anonymity, I NEVER would have guessed I’d have it rated by the end of the week. 2003 brew, thrown together in a 22 oz. bottling that looks like some sort of special favor-- sharpie scribbles with the name written over what seems to be a keg sticker. Dark brown in color with a rocky head and burgundy-brown edging. Decent retention but weak lacing on the rocky head. I’m sure the carbonation would have been better in its prime/on draft, but I’ll take it if I can get it. Not a huge detraction. Aroma has some cinnamon, light earthiness and a fantastic medley of all the medium-dark malt characters I can think of-- oft-neglected recollections like black truffle, earthy vanilla, touches of light licorice and peat, and dry dark malt. Flavor brings a light roastiness with a touch of wood, hints of smoke and light leather, and a return of many points of reference from the nose. Only mildly disappointing (in relative terms) because there’s not quite the layering of the aroma. Wonderfully subtle and delicate. Mouthfeel is fantastic-- lightly chalky and dry; long finish with fabulous cooling sensation throughout. The one big frustration was the lack of carbonation and the head, but it didn’t take anything away from the lovely cool mouthfeel. I’d imagine this beer is mind-blowing in its perfect form. Hell of a porter. Thanks, random guy!"
Watch City Zoks Baltic Porter;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Baltic;Watch City Brewing Co.;Creamy mocha aroma with a nutty backdrop. Assertive plum and woody notes that bring out a beautiful bittersweet chocolate nose. Vinous body filled with cardamom and cinnamon. Semidry roasted, peppery licorice finish. So so tasty.
Watch City Zoks Baltic Porter;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Baltic;Watch City Brewing Co.;2003 issue: Mahogany-cast ebony. Dull mocha foam ring of teeny-sized bubbles. Glorious aroma of cream-filled pastry, earthy roast, dried currants, vinous Port, and custard. Lightly oxidized with vanilla, nougat, smoke, and bittersweet chocolate hints. Trace cinnamon ester as well. Silky, oily body. Mellow carbonation. Remarkably polished and focused, upfront, showcasing a thick custard flavor alongside charred sugar and smoky undertones. Beefy body from the scant carbonation and the plastery yeast flavor and thickness. Well-masked alcohol. Teasing interplay of roasted grains, robust char dryness, and oxidation, which intensifies the char. Anise and cinnamon accompany a mild leathered fruit twang and black licorice tingle. Sumptuous center of chewy toffee and creamed nougat gives way to a rich roast and bittersweet chocolate profusion, which eternally lingers. This may be perfect if not for the notable air seepage, which has clearly lessened the carbonation and allowed oxidation to set in. Bottling-line issue? Stylish and highly authentic, nevertheless. Thx, michmike!
Watch City Zoks Baltic Porter;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Baltic;Watch City Brewing Co.;"22 oz bomber, bottled a couple of months ago. Pours a thick molasses color, with a minimal fine dark brown head. Strong, complex nose is by turns grapy, molasses/raisiny, anise-inflected. Very nice! Very sweet and decadently rich on the tongue, at first fruity (cherry-raisin-grape), somewhat caramelly with hints of vanilla in the middle, and then finishing with one of the most incredible bursts of chocolaty richness that I've ever experienced. On the level of Mackeson and Youngs Double Chocolate, that's how rich it is. Port wine notes throught, a slight dollop of herbal character, just a hint of finishing roastiness, and you have an absolutely phenomenal porter that verges into the sweeter side of Imperial stout-land. I don't mind the low carbonation much, but if it has a flaw that's it. Nitpicking; this is phenomenal stuff."

Watch City Zoks Baltic Porter;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Baltic;Watch City Brewing Co.;Winner of the Brewmasters Choice as best in show at the 2003 Boston homebrewers competition - brewed at WCBC by Paul Zocco. Pours a deep black from which no light can escape. The head is small and brown, and laces nicely. Aroma is huge, with dark roasted malts, some dark fruitiness, a hint of chocolate, and some anise. Flavor is equally large, coffee, dark fruits, cherry, some anice, and a good spicy finish. Body is as full as full can be, slight bits of alcohol came through in the end. A truly superb beer, I gotta get back to WC and get me another growler (or 2) of this stuff.

Spinning Dog Harvest Moon;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hereford Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Golden beer, maintaining decent condition in the glass. Tangerine/orange malt base. Good solid bitterness but perhaps not as complex or more importantly for a bitter, balanced, as some. Wholly drinkable in any case.

Mission Street Pale Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Unfortunately picked up a bottle that is 11 months old at TJs. Despite that, this is not a bad PA and I imagine fresh it is pretty good value. Aroma: other than some oxidation which translates to a stale aroma, there are is mild bready sweetness from the malts, and a subtle earthy hop aroma as well Appearance: Pours a hazy medium amber similar to say a Sierra PA. the head is minimal as is its retention and lacing almost non existent. Taste: very nice balance between the malts and the earthy hops and their bitterness. Palate: medium body, with semi rich texture, moderate carbonation and minimal astringency. Finishes short and dry with a faint but astringency on the palate

Mission Street Pale Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);If I were to rate by looks and smells alone, Mission Street Pale Ale would be damn near perfect. This Pale Ale has a golden-orange shade and a snow white head. Aroma contains grass, cannabis, and sweet malt. The big aroma makes the understated taste a surprising disappointment. Well, maybe disappointment is a bit harsh. Mission Street Pale Ale has little bitterness and would be unlikely to scare away hop shy individuals. While I admire the balance, I want more hops. Still, for the price, you could do a lot worse.
Mission Street Pale Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottle. Pale yellow with small foamy white head, floral hops aroma, high carbonation, floral hoppy taste, longish finish. Nice floral pale ale.

Neustadt Springs 10w30;Neustadt, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Neustadt Springs Brewery;This is the beer that the man with the straw hat (who lives around the corner) claims to be the finest beer in the province. Which is hard to accept, but to each her/his own. It’s a straight up malt bomb. Tastes like a beer nut milkshake. Sweet brown sugar with a bit of oatmeal. I agree with the reviewer a few entries below who says there’s no hops to be found. Ugh. This is going to slow down my drinking tonight, which is a drag. On the positive side, I bet this would make a great cooking beer (my ox-tail stew calls for a porter but I think this would do better).

Harrington's Brewers' Selection Doppelbock;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Golden amber colour with a reassuring carpet of off-white head. There’s a gentle sparkle as well. The aroma is lush and deep with plenty of ripe orchard stonefruit: stewed peaches, apricots and typical German maltiness. I suspect this Doppelbock is quite a different animal than its predecessor. There’s that lush, full bodied chewy maltiness amid a riot of sherbety mouthfeel and a definite sour twinge that adds another layer of appreciation to the beer. There’s a long finish and a strong appreciation from the imbiber..
Harrington's Brewers' Selection Doppelbock;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);330ml bottle.

There’s no great depth here, but it’s pleasant and well-balanced.

Kelburn Goldihops;Glasgow, Strathclyde, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kelburn Brewery;"Advertised as ""Golden, hoppy, clean on the palate and leaving a long lingering after-taste that will haunt you until you quest for more."" Yep haunted for sure. It tastes okay until you get the after taste. Little bit hoppy and someone says it tasted like paper (has anyone on here actually eaten paper since they were like 2?). So can’t confirm that but it’s the aftertaste that is haunting me. Some people might like it but it’s not for me. Next pint will be something different. Dirty orange is an accurate colour. Enjoy"

Kelburn Goldihops;Glasgow, Strathclyde, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kelburn Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Chequers, Oxford. Gold with white head. This proved to be quite a thin, watery beer, there is a damp, grainy cereal character, then a dullish floral note. Not really for me.
Kelburn Goldihops;Glasgow, Strathclyde, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kelburn Brewery;Cask. Watery, citrus. A horrible sulfur taste ruins it, on the nose too. Kelburn are normally good.

Tilburgs Kruikenbier;Berkel-Enschot, Netherlands;Tripel;La Trappe Trappist - Abdij O.L.V. Koningshoeven (Bavaria);Bottle: Nice vast off white foamy head. Hazy dark orange amber color. Smell fruits (orange and red fruit), sweet malts, hint of hops. Taste light fruity and hoppy with balanced bitterness and sweet dryness. Taste fruit, hops, bitter, light sweets and spices.

Felstar Hoppin Hen;Dunmow, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felstar;Bottle conditioned. Clear amber with some natural rising bubbles. Metallic aroma. Soft fizzy mouthfeel is not encouraging. The malts are there quite pleasantly, but they are in the background to the soft fizz which gets in the way of the flavour. Flat finish. Why are we Brits so bad at bottle conditioning our beers?
Rock Bottom La Jolla Old Curmudgeon Imperial Porter;La Jolla, California, United States;Porter - Imperial;Rock Bottom La Jolla;September 10th, 2012 - Rock Bottom La Jolla’s lighter beers have been roundly disappointing, but as I move down the color spectrum, I find something much more pleasant to sip when I reach the Old Curmudgeon Porter. The smell of oak chips, applewood and smoked bacon comprise the smell, altogether reminding me of my one trip to a Korean BBQ restaurant. There’s a note of cherry flavored pipe tobacco, too. Though the aroma is slow and low, the flavor is busy and tangy. The bitterness of fresh greens sprouts in the mid to aftertaste, and some very slight touches of unripe raspberry and blackberry give this palate something to have for dessert, but it’s not overly sweet. This is, by far, the best sampler I’ve had from Rock Bottom’s La Jolla satellite so far.
Rock Bottom La Jolla Old Curmudgeon Imperial Porter;La Jolla, California, United States;Porter - Imperial;Rock Bottom La Jolla;Cask at The Ritual Tavern. Pours quite black with a finger and a half of frothy tan head. Aroma of milk chocolate and cookie dough. Taste is earthy roasted malts, rich earthy coffee, and bittersweet chocolate.

The aroma has notes of big bittersweet chocolate, walnut, fig, anise, aromatic and herbal hops, and coffee. The taste is sweet, beefy, and a tad boozy too. Supported by twangy fruits and smoke upon the finish. The mouth feel is warming, oily, and lush. A nice complex brew that displays it’s PORTER roots.

Oggis Good Time Barley Wine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;Very nice big beer. Good amlt and hops balance with some residual sweetnes. Raisins and molasses with a somewhat herbal character. Caramel andtoasted almonds on a citrus hop background, Simcoe maybe.

Oggis Good Time Barley Wine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;This beer was had at the Oggi’s in Vista location. It pours a clear red and slight mahogany color with a moderate white creamy head and very good lacing on the glass. The nose is totally caramel and sweet malt with sugar candy, nuts and molasses being the other possible notes. The flavor is all heavy caramel and candy sugar with serious nutty and toasty qualities mixed in with a serious dose of carbonation. Some viscous caramel and syrupy sweetness in the finish...heavily cloying and one-dimensional in its sweetness. Pleasant because I enjoy sweets, but really nothing all too exciting because of that sweetness and lack of hoppy bitterness.
Oggis Good Time Barley Wine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;"(Draft: Oggi’s in Vista, CA) Mmm, a barleywine to sip and appreciate how well it’s made; The balanced flavor is malty and sweet like most barleywines, but also very bitter, especially in the finish, so the sweetness is balanced out; It’s kind of tealike too; Hoppy bitterness keeps the finish crisp and balanced, and prevents the sweetness of this beer from being cloying; The nose is very sweet, malty, quite hoppy and alcoholic, and as the beer warms up, a mild early and mushroom aroma develops; Medium brown in color; Large light tan head on the pour is big for a barleywine, but eventually settles to a sheen, leaving some patchy lacing"
Oggis Good Time Barley Wine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;Sampled draught at Oggi’s, Vista. Muddy brownish amber, creamy lasting head. The nose is caramel - loads of caramel! It is soft and sweet, very malty with beautifully balanced hop bitter finish. (And even more caramel...)

The flavor is sweet and full of caramel with a slight bitterness and a little alcohol. Full bodied, smooth and a touch dry.
Oggis Good Time Barley Wine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;4/26/04. On draft at Lucky Baldwin’s in Pasadena, CA 4/26/04. Pours a very dark brown, slightly murky with a reddish glow. Head is slight, tan-grey with a very thin, lingering sheath. Lacing is superb, ashen and sticky, somewhat blotchy. Aroma is surprisingly fruity for as dark as the beer is. I thought it was going to be dirty and twiggy. Almost vinous and woody. Hops are there, and slight caramel malts to go with sweet and light fruit. Initial taste is a creamy, luscious and vinous experience. Lovely hum of alcohol chases the swallow. Caramel malts, twiggy hop/malt interplay (there it is!), and a hop glow with apparent alcohol. Nice tease between sweet and dry, but it’s a tad bland and overly alcoholic. Medium-full, wonderful body. Finish is extremely bitter, dirty malt with lingering caramel and some bread. Very long and pleasant, forging a nice middle ground between kick-your-ass and soothing. A little bit too simple to be mind-blowing. It coats part of your mouth, but doesn’t take over your body and mind. Sticky on the lips, a slight taste of wax way down deep. Goes down very nice and smooth but punishes afterwards. Quite nice overall.
Oggis Good Time Barley Wine;San Clemente, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oggis Pizza and Brewing Company;Nice amber color with minimal head. Aroma of sweet malt. Excellent balance with a nice, warm finish.

Brillaint copper in colour, with a decent off-white head. Sweet, caramel aroma with a touch of fruit and some earthy hops.

Wolf Grandma's Christmas Reserve;Besthorpe, Norfolk, England;Brown Ale;Wolf Brewery;[500ml bottle from The Little Beer Shop, Blofield, Norfolk] Pours dark brown with a moderate but lasting beige head. Slightly too much carbonation for the style. Taste initially very bitter, with a syrupy sweetness behind. Coriander seed eventually comes through, but just adds a further layer of woody bitterness. Not totally unpleasant, but not a beer that makes me think of Christmas in anyway, and not something I’d choose to drink again.

Coopers Heritage;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;OLD NOTES JAN 25, 2004 Light malt aroma, some odd smells that don’t come through until the flavour of the beer itself. Pours golden with a creamy little head. I found the flavour very odd. At first it taste like sherbert! Soda kind of mouth feel to it and a bit of dough flavour. Really odd, and ultimately disappointing brew from Coopers.
Coopers Heritage;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;I’m just updating my records. Not up too Coopers usually good standards. A bit disappointing.
Coopers Heritage;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;25 Apr 2006 - Very light sweet hop aroma. Clear amber colour, reasonable head and lacing. Hoppy low malt flavour. Thin, simple hop finish and aftertaste.
Coopers Heritage;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;Hop malt aroma. Clear amber colour with poor head and lacing. Bitter hop malt flavour. Fizzy palate.
Coopers Heritage;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;By Coopers standards this is pretty bad. Over sweet and sugary. What is with the heritage bit... Very out of character for this brewer.
Coopers Heritage;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;Small white head, on a clear golden base. Strawy lagery aroma. Light malty taste, some POR too. Plain finish. Dont really see any point to this beer.
Coopers Heritage;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;An orange beer with a disappearing white head. The aroma is sweet with notes of straw and malt, while the flavor is a boring malty one, with a light hoppy end. Boring.
Coopers Heritage;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;Bottle. Hrm...this one is definitely hype over substance. Great looking bottle with white foil up the neck. Impressive name. The actual beer is not a patch on their bottle conditioned ales. Coppery amber in colour with small rocky off white head which does not really last. Stuff all in the aroma, some feint malt, very feint esters, nothing else. Taste is a bit buttery, a little fruity, but almost no balancing hop bitterness. Mouth is fizzy and watery...disappointing on the whole.
Coopers Heritage;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;Bottled. Light hazy yellow colour, some nice floral notes and nothing skunky or rough to speak of, but fairly uninspiring overall.
Coopers Heritage;Regency Park, South Australia, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coopers Brewery;375 ml bottle. Slightly hazy golden beer. A touch of peach/apricot aroma. Flavour of honey, peach and apple. Light floral hop character. Light acidity on the finish.
Paddys Amber Ale;Flemington, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Yeah, i hear the word ’amber’ and think that there is going to be a degree of blandless in the beer. JS has a good stable but their amber is the most ordinary of them all. The colour is as expected with a clean white head. The crystal malt flavour adds to the character of the beer but it really seems to be a bit of a lame attempt at doing something different. This brewery does some good beers so it would be worthwhile attempting something with a bit more grunt.
Paddys Amber Ale;Flemington, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Draught, at Paddy’s Brewpub, Flemington, Australia. Amber with a plastic (static) white head. This beer doesn’t seem real. As the boys have eluded to or stated outright, this style of beer usually just makes up the ranks of a breweries portfolio and very often isn’t given the love and care that all beers deserve. Paddy’s have dropped the ball on this one which is a shame. The gathering: duff, eczematic, motelpogo, Spiesy, Sully and late arrival Linc.
Paddys Amber Ale;Flemington, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);This seemed like a JS Amber knockoff to me and I really dislike JS Amber. Some kind of fruitiness of aroma, kind of tropical I guess. Tasted like it had a fair bit of amber malt in it but apparently contains none, some toasty malt, a fair bit of stone-fruit sourness and light bitterness. My least favourite of Paddy’s generally good beers.
Paddys Amber Ale;Flemington, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);nfob03. no big surprises. amber. some butterscotch and vanilla with a hint of grapefruit tang. decent enough
Paddys Amber Ale;Flemington, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);On tap at the Brisbane Festival of beers. Pretty much what i expected from an Aussie amber ale. Light, sweetish toffee and nuts flavour, with a lightly watery finish, pretty tame in every aspect, but drinkable i suppose.
Paddys Amber Ale;Flemington, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);every brewpub seems to think they have to have an irish red or an amber ale and it’s usually the worst beer. boring, crystal malt flavour, sweet, round, a bit bready and bland, with Goldings or something english hopswise. rer8: this time it had a strong chlorine taste that wasn’t the most appetising - the only dud at paddys.
Paddys Wheat Beer;Flemington, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);"Sampled from tap at the brewpub on July 11, 2013. As ""Paddy’s Wheat Unfiltered"". Hazy yellow color, white head. Sweet, malty, banana scent. Sweet, sugary, phenolic, bitter taste. Bitter, banana aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, medium bitterness."
Paddys Wheat Beer;Flemington, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Pours a hazy yellow with a white head. Aroma is wheaty, fruit, banana, yeast and some spice. Taste is light sweet of wheat leading to a fruity finish. Decent.
Paddys Wheat Beer;Flemington, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Draught @ the brewpub Wasn’t too sure if this was a Wheat beer or a Wit. Smells a bit like honey with a touch of lemon in the taste as well, cloves in and out as well. Still it was drinkable.
Paddys Wheat Beer;Flemington, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);The previous comments regarding the witbier/weizen meld seemed to ring true with my sample, as I was sure I could taste some orange and coriander. Either they are still using that mix or I am talking out of my arse (which are equally likely). Quite a well balanced flavour, and very more-ish and refreshing. Good depth of flavour although the finish is a bit short. However allround it’s a pretty decent beer.
Paddys Wheat Beer;Flemington, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Above-average Aussie wheat beer. Not a favourite style but this seemed pretty true to its benchmark. Bright gold with a skinny, lasting head. Qutie a creamy aroma (seems to be a house feature). Quite chewy wheat and clove notes. A swirl released some sourish banana. Soft banana flavours, clove - pretty much what you’d expect. Overall, very clean and a very fair attempt. (Draught at brewpub)
Paddys Wheat Beer;Flemington, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Draught at the brewpub. Clear pale yellow. Typical weizenbier banana aroma. Sweet and soft with some light toffee flavour. Nicely drinkable with well structure malt. I like it!
Paddys Wheat Beer;Flemington, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);With push coming to shove my least style of beer includes the wheat. A large generalisation I know but partly because I have a degree of wheat intolerance but more predominantly due the enjoyment of a more assertive style. So many so-called aussie wheats are poor substitutes for piss-poor lagers. This one unfortunately has more of the latter characters than some of the good Euro styles. Quite typically estery with pineapple and banana but just not a great one. I think, to be fair, that this was not tried in a reasonable order so that certain predecessors may have clouded my review
Paddys Wheat Beer;Flemington, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Draught, at Paddy’s Brewpub, Flemington, Australia. This beer looks all the world like a larger. Amber with a bright, persistent white head. Bubblegum aroma and flavour, with all the other classic notes…banana and glove. (I was in the Eczematic school of sniffing on this evening). The gathering: duff, eczematic, motelpogo, Spiesy, Sully and late arrival Linc.
Paddys Wheat Beer;Flemington, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);"hey, not a bad kristall. was expecting a watery ""american wheat"" since it's so clear, but then all the right stuff was going on in the flavour - plenty of bubblegum, clove and just the right amount of banana (not OTT like JS colonial) and a decent malty body."
Paddys Wheat Beer;Flemington, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Orange, banana, vanilla as mentioned by the others. Decent tasty hefe, I couldn't compare it to a traditional German draught version but it worked for me. Refreshing.
Paddys Chocolate Porter;Flemington, Australia;Porter;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);"Sampled from tap at the brewpub on July 11, 2013. As ""Paddy’s Porter"". Clear dark brown color, tan head. Sweet, roasted, ash, cocoa scent. A bit acidic, dry, light roasted taste. Roasted, dry, grainy aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, medium bitterness that is dry. Some dry chocolate taste too."
Paddys Chocolate Porter;Flemington, Australia;Porter;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Pours very dark with a beige head. Aroma is malt, chocolate, coffee and some roastiness. Taste is medium sweet of chocolate leading to a light roasty and hoppy finish. Good stuff.
Paddys Chocolate Porter;Flemington, Australia;Porter;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);draught at the brewpub. heavy on the chocolate, although i agree with whoever it was that said its more cocoa powder. very rich chocolate with a slightly bitter finish
Paddys Chocolate Porter;Flemington, Australia;Porter;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Draught at Paddy’s Brewpub, Sydney. Dark brown with smallish off white head. Aroma and flavour of chocolate (predominantly cocoa powder), nuts and a little roast. Thin medium bodied. Soft carbonation. Low bitterness. More chocolate in the finish.
Paddys Chocolate Porter;Flemington, Australia;Porter;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Draught at the brewpub The body looked like a decent porter although there wasn’t much of a head. Taste reminded me of a J.Squire porter in that you seem to get pencil shavings, also like a robust porter just a bit thin. If anything some rich Belgian chocolate in the taste, this beer shows promise but falls away.
Paddys Chocolate Porter;Flemington, Australia;Porter;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Deep dark brown color. Fudge brownies with a hint of cherries erupts from the nose. Mouth is sour, but that worked well for the beer. Brownies just lingered in my mouth long after I finished the beer. Nice. Re-rate - not enough body. Not as good as two years ago
Paddys Chocolate Porter;Flemington, Australia;Porter;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);RE-RATE. Draught at Paddys Pub. Let this warm up for a good hour prior to tasting. Arrvied deep, dark brown with an off-white, creamy head which lasted very well. Aroma was of coco powder and bitter chocolate with roasted malts, licorice and some dates. Flavor was of smooth roasted malts with creamy milk chocolate, coco powder, toffee with dry biscuity notes and licorice (mild) in the finish.
Paddys Chocolate Porter;Flemington, Australia;Porter;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);This one was a dark ruby red with a small head. Some nice chocolate on the aroma, but not that dominant. On tasting it’s quite creamy, like most of Paddy’s beers, and slightly sweet. Alcohol was surprisingly evident. Just a step behind the rest of their beers.
Paddys Chocolate Porter;Flemington, Australia;Porter;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Least favourite of the seven beers sampled with Bridge on the epic April 25 2006 trip to Flemington. I’m not a huge fan of thin, sweet beers. Which is not to say that this isn’t to style, just that it’s not to taste. This one was a teak colour with a short head - much thinner than the Export Stout, or indeed any of the other beers we sampled. Sweet Kahlua-like aroma of molten chocolate and milky coffee. Faint bitterness in the mix. Carbonation seemed to me to be too fizzy. Very sweet flavour mix with some faint chocolate (serving temp too low) and malt. This was the only disappointment of the day. (Draught at brewpub)
Paddys Chocolate Porter;Flemington, Australia;Porter;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Draught at the brewpub. Very dark brown. None surprising chocolatey malt aroma. Medium sweet with notes of coffee, but the chocolate dominates. Velvetty finish. The soft mouthfeel really brings out the flavours.
Paddys Scottish Ale;Flemington, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Overpowering. The fact I was rushing a schooner didn’t help matters! A little like xmas as a kid and stuffing too many licorice allsorts in your mouth. With cinammon.
Paddys Scottish Ale;Flemington, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);I expected more from this beer, considering it recieved a gold medal at the AIBA. Pale amber colour, sickly sweet, estery nose, a hint of peaches. Very sweet palate, thick and cloying, not easy to drink at all, one dimensional flavour of pale malt extract, a little fruity. Served too cold for the style, but I really wouldn’t have wanted to taste what was going on at at higher temperature. Dissappointing.
Paddys Scottish Ale;Flemington, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);there is a real doppelbock quality to this - it's smooth and chocolatey with faint oak and vanilla. a bit sticky, quite thick - like ice cream topping. good stuff
Paddys Scottish Ale;Flemington, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Great appearance. Deep brown with ruby edges. Good head retention and lacing and all that. Bockish at times, toffee/caramel, nuts. Lightly sticky, but dry and smooth for the most part, some light roast to finish off aswell. Nice soft, clean, tasty and good value at 3 dollars a schooner.
Paddys Scottish Ale;Flemington, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);nobbad getting a schooner of 6.5% scottish ale for $3. notwithstanding the bargain, this is a reasonable wee heavy thats not too heavy and doesnt have too much wee. simple, just lots and lots of sweet, clean, nutty malt. finish is dry-malty, and slightly minty. nice big malty mouthfeel. doesnt have much in the way of peat or anything, more like a doppelbock made with an ale yeast.
Paddys Stout;Flemington, Australia;Stout;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Hop malt spice aroma. Dark brown colour with great head and lacing. Roast malt chocolate flavour. Smooth palate. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Paddys Stout;Flemington, Australia;Stout;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);This has to be the best stout on tap in Sydney. Not a difficult achievement I suppose given that it is the only stout on tap in Sydney. This has a deep opaque darkness with a creamy caramel head. This has a very good roasted character with some burnt chocolate in it. Not highly hoppy as the bitterness comes from the malts.
Paddys Stout;Flemington, Australia;Stout;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Draught, at Paddy’s Brewpub, Flemington, Australia. Rich dark stout with a dark brown, scummy head. Lovely rich silky flavour. Very smooth drop. Best stout in Sydney on tap by some distance. Probably worth the journey to this back of nowhere pub on its own. The gathering: duff, eczematic, motelpogo, Spiesy, Sully and late arrival Linc.
Paddys Stout;Flemington, Australia;Stout;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Proper stout, thick roasty flavours, a little alcoholic warmth, oiliness and mild anglo hops.
Paddys Stout;Flemington, Australia;Stout;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Good stuff. Nice rich roasty, oily, tarry, chocolatey and burnt. Some sweet toffee. Pretty good as far as Aussie stouts go, can't complain.
Paddys Stout;Flemington, Australia;Stout;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);Really reminded me of Coopers Stout. Loads of tarry flavours, with more chocolate and probably equally as much coffee. Aroma reminded me of the time we wanted to make Irish Carbombs but only had Erin Cream and Coopers Stout, quite alcoholic and liquery but with those roasty things going on. Flavour is quite headily alcoholic, but backed up by loads of roastiness. Nice, but would be vastly improved with less alcohol/varnish flavour.
Paddys Stout;Flemington, Australia;Stout;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);right up there as australian stouts go. black as the inside of a polar bear. burnt toffee aroma with traces of fish sauce. quite chewy with some vanilla and dried dog food. was served a bit too cold but we are in australia
Paddys Stout;Flemington, Australia;Stout;Paddys Pub and Brewery (Australia);"definitely an australian style stout, like coopers, sheaf, carbine - heavy on the chocolate malt but low on the hops, with a nice oily texture. black as the inside of one of gusler's ""Cows"" holy ""DOOLy"" batman i like the ""TAN HEAD"" as well. rich, sweet and full bodied, with toasty tingle only showing up at the finish, with no roasted bitterness at all. like it."
Saint Sebastiaan The Novice Light;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;I noticed a nice fresh aroma of biscuit and a light beachy aroma. Flavor on the palate was minimal with no distracting flavors, and very light citrusy hop aspects. Thinnest head of all of the St. S beers.
Saint Sebastiaan The Novice Light;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Remember now they are making an effort to introduce beer to a wider audience up in this area of hard to find good brews. Yes it’s a light. Nice flavor & texture. Some fruity essence on the nose with a clear amber color & a crisp taste. Well done ... but, it’s a light! :-)
Saint Sebastiaan The Novice Light;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Pretty fruity taste to this, some banana even, this is probably the best light lager I’ve ever had. Even though it’s a light beer how can you diss this.
Saint Sebastiaan The Novice Light;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Light hop aroma and a tinge of sweet malts, but not much else. Transparent pale yellow with a dime thin white head. Watery fore leads into a hop cereal grain and malt finish. Not a bad little lager, but not anything that will make you rethink the style either..
Saint Sebastiaan The Novice Light;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Clear pale straw body with small white head. Aroma is medium sweet, honey, light spice. Taste is moderately sweet, honey, some grassy, minimally bitter. Light-medium body, some crispness. No surprises here -- as the name suggests, a beer for the masses. Still, certainly drinkable.
Saint Sebastiaan The Novice Light;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;I have trouble coming up with a lot to say about light beers. Typical of the style, watery, with the flavor being almost imperceptable. Having said that, what taste was there was still better than the macrobrewed light beers.
Saint Sebastiaan The Novice Light;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Perhaps the palest looking beer I have ever seen. Looks almost like a glass of water with one drop of yellow food coloring with a thin white head. Very subtle somewhat tart, malty aroma. Body is very thin and watery, but has some grainy malt character to it. Drinkable, yes, better than the typical BMC light beers, most likely, but nothing great.
Saint Sebastiaan The Novice Light;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Draft at Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery in Spring Hill, FL. Thedm, Matta and I had a wonderful supper and sampled the beers here at this fine establishment. This beer had a small sized white head that was creamy and smooth and contained fine sized bubbles that mostly dissipated. The body was uncarbonated and transparent with a pale yellow hue. The nose was malty as was the flavor of this beer. The mouthfeel was smooth, watery and thin. This was a light bodied beer with good lacing.
Saint Sebastiaan The Novice Light;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 90. This draft brew was sampled at the brewery in Spring Hill Florida with Matta and was served to us by Jim Leen, the brewer, and Serge Van Limbergen, the owner. This brew poured a medium sized head of foamy finely sized white colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a softly carbonated transparent very light weak yellow colored body and agood lace. The mouthfeel was tinglyand bubbly while the aroma was that of a medium malt hop. The flavor was that of a very mild malt hop.
Saint Sebastiaan The Novice Light;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Let me begin by saying that the microbrewery is Absolutely Amazing! I was lucky enough to enjoy these beers with some visitors to Florida, TheDM and Hotstuff, very nice company. The owners and brew-masters of St. Sebastiaan, Leen, and her husband Serge were very kind and exceptionally knowledgeable people as well. Thanks to all! 6oz sample: The Novice Light’s name describes it well. The body was a lucid yellow gold, totally transparent, small white, quickly diminishing head…. In the nose I picked up on a touch of lemon zest and a pinch of saltiness…. The flavor was rather lackluster, again a bit of lemon, slight hint of yeast, mostly just reminiscent of seltzer water…. This beer reminded me of swallowing a mouth full of salt water when swimming in the Gulf.
Saint Sebastiaan Spring Hill Blond;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Sweet and sweet with a pleasing aroma of citrus and spices, but very subdued. Slightly cloudy with a strong white head. Aroma was the best part of this beer, but the body was solid and not as sweet as the aroma promised. Lacked the lactic sourness I was expecting as the backflavor.
Saint Sebastiaan Spring Hill Blond;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Anoter good one after my novice sample, pretty much the same going on I thought but more alcohol to give it more of a bite, great fruity banana like flavor, cloudy yellow nice fluffy head, good beer.
Saint Sebastiaan Spring Hill Blond;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Sweet spun sugar and malt aroma with a little bit of spice. Cloudy Yellow. Fluffy white head that fades fast. Mild spice and ample yeastiness with maybe a tinge of apple fruitines. Not the most flavorful beer, but has an incredible mouthfeel for this style that I found very enjoyable.
Saint Sebastiaan Spring Hill Blond;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Creamy white head atop clear pale straw body. Aroma is medium sweet, cardemom, curacao. Taste is medium sweet, cardemom, some herbal, light curacao. Light-medium body, some creaminess. Easy drinking beer.
Saint Sebastiaan Spring Hill Blond;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;What an unlikely place to find such a nice brewery. I hope it makes it in the long run....but who in the heck visits Spring Hill? Oh well. This ale was not too shabby. I agree with BeanDip. It is very similar to DT both in appearance and aroma. I think the flavor is where it comes up a bit short. It’s good, but a bit too weak. I liken it to a DT light or Duvel light if such ales existed. All in all, this spicy, clovey, coriander-laced brew is a good drink.
Saint Sebastiaan Spring Hill Blond;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Draft: Pours a hazy clouded yellow with a thin white head. Very mild Belgian malt and yeast aroma. Body has a light sweetness and good palate, but could be fuller in flavor. Overall a very drinkable, but somewhat bland beer.

This brew poured a small head of finely sized white colored mostly diminishing bubbles that left behind a uncarbonated hazy yellow colored body. It had a nice floral aroma and asmooth initial mouthfeel with a floral hop finish. The flavor was nice and complex, as a good Belgian Ale should be, with a mild coriander and light floral flavor.
Saint Sebastiaan Spring Hill Blond;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;"Well this was not my intended #300 rating. I had intended to chill a special bottle of Fullers Vintage 2000, however due to the great company; TheDM & Hotstuff, this beer will work just fine for #300. I must again mention that this is a surreal Belgian Microbrewery, you must visit when you make you way into Florida. 6oz Sampler: This beer poured a cloudy lemon colored body, a short white head accompanied it, leaving behind a decent ring of lace. The nose was reminiscent of a Belgian Witbier. An aroma and flavor of lemon and orange zests, notes of coriander and clove stand out… suggestions of other spices, oily crisp finish, Nothing overly exciting in a 6oz sampler but I suspect a tulip glass, as they are typically served in, would far better display this beer."
Saint Sebastiaan 1731 Dark;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Chestnut brown - almost opaque. Taupe head that covers with a thick collar. Cola and dried prune on the aroma. Medium to full bready mouthfeel. Finish is rather short.
Saint Sebastiaan 1731 Dark;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;The best of their offerings. But I still feel that it is lighter and less assertive than others in it’s class. Rich aromas of burnt sugar, curacao orange and raisens, but a thinner body, less malt and hop bitterness than it should have had. head fell quickly and didn’t lace the glass at all. Suffers the most from St. S’s too cold servings. At 50 degrees this would be a much better beer than it is at 38 degrees.
Saint Sebastiaan 1731 Dark;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;"Not quite up there with their Belgian brethern peers. Could it be the FL swamp water? ;-) Best of the sampled lot IMHO. Medium of body, flavor & alcohol content meaning not as much yeast in the aroma or palate, solidly built yet not too heavy and not quite as big. Overall an enjoyable ale at a unique place."
Saint Sebastiaan 1731 Dark;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;First thing that came to mind, very roasty, nutty, chocolatey, and caramel, good beer best of the 4 I had, dark brown with slight red tint to it, tan head.
Saint Sebastiaan 1731 Dark;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Brown Sugar baby! This beer smells like warm brown sugar and spices. Smell is excellent. One of the best smelling beers you can buy in Florida I’ll wager. Dark mahagonay color with a firm two finger thick tan head. Sweet brown sugar and all spice flavors with a nice malt and yeast backbone. An excellent beer that suffers only a thin palate, but is otherwise exemplary.
Saint Sebastiaan 1731 Dark;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Clear, dark red-brown body with creamy tan head. Aroma is moderately sweet, candi sugar, caramel, raisin, anise. Taste is moderately sweet, candi sugar, anise, caramel, raisin, faint herbal, finishes a bit astringent. Watery light-medium body.
Saint Sebastiaan 1731 Dark;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;I wanted to like this one more, but just couldn’t. It’s like they didn’t take it far enough...that’s the best way I can explain it. The aroma was ok, nothing to get crazy about. The flavor, mouthfeel were both very thin. Lacking in complexity? I’d say so. I like the suggestion of one the other raters who said this might benefit from some bottle conditioning. I think that would be a good experiment. If you’re ever on Rt 19 heading south into Spring Hill you really should stop by this place.
Saint Sebastiaan 1731 Dark;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;This dark colored beer had a slight malt scent. Roasted malt, with a bit of chocolate in the taste. Fairly simple, but good.
Saint Sebastiaan 1731 Dark;Spring Hill, Florida, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Saint Sebastiaan Belgian Microbrewery;Draft: Pours a dark murky brown with a thin light tan head. Soft, weak chocolate malty aroma with a touch of bready Belgian yeast. Body is semi-sweet and smooth with earthy malt flavor coming through towards the end. Finishes crisp and bready. Has some moderate complexity and balance, but would probably be better served bottle conditioned.

Alameda Papa's Old Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Alameda Brewing Co.;22oz bomber purchased at a Grocery Outlet for like $4.39. I was hoping for a British style Old Ale. I feel like I got an ASA or a strong amber. Is this an American Ale yeast?Its too clean, a cola flavor. Some light herbal hoppiness. Light fruitiness. But really not an old ale, I guess in PDX they don’t like British style beers. About 4oz of a bomber is all I need, the rest gets dumper.
Alameda Papa's Old Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Alameda Brewing Co.;"Nitro at C Bar Portland. ""Nitro"" pour is deep chestnut with spitty bubbles on top. Light licorice, maple, and fresh pine aromas. Water, blueberry, Honeycomb cereal, and tar may not be the most complimentary deScriptors for the flavors I’m getting, but that’s what I’m putting down. Thin body and lesser carbonation make for a merely mediocre drop."
Alameda Papa's Old Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Alameda Brewing Co.;Pours a half finger of head on a dark brown body. The aroma is faint chocolate, a little cinnamon and milk. The taste is roasted malt, chocolate and a mild bitter finish. Great balance. The texture is smooth. Enjoyable.
Alameda Papa's Old Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Alameda Brewing Co.;Keg at the brewpub, PDX, 11/11/14. Mahogany brown topped with a moderate beige swirl and edgeing. Nose is spice, tarte fruit notes, toffee. Taste comprises brown sugar, dark fruit rinds, sweet notes, earthy, spice, toffee. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close. Ok.
Alameda Papa's Old Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Alameda Brewing Co.;22oz bottle in a tulip. Pours deep brown with a beige head. Aroma of caramel and chocolate malts, some spices, dough, hints of hops, and some light off-notes. Flavor the same with sort of a weird blend. Average to smoother texture. Not great.
Alameda Papa's Old Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Alameda Brewing Co.;A bit of molasses flavor in this. Its a hardy beer, thick, distinct, but not my favorite.
Alameda Papa's Old Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Alameda Brewing Co.;22oz bottle pours a murky brown with a ring of beige head. Nose has a lot of soggy toast, brown sugar, mildly gristy, a little dried leaves, some roasted carrot. Flavot has a little Chinese barley tea, malty, bread crust, some brown sugar. Fairly clean finish. Drinks like it’s 4%.
Alameda Papa's Old Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Alameda Brewing Co.;Bitter beer, coffee hints. A nice beer. Liked it, good winter taste. Also chocolate hints. Rich beer.
Alameda Papa's Old Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Alameda Brewing Co.;"described as an old ale/winter warmer, it looked the part...then things went south. multiple simultaneous drainpours. maybe infected, who knows. it was waxed in a 750, nice presentation. shitty beer. tart aroma and flavor on top of a malty base that just didn’t fit. a few sips in i’d had enough. Too bad...the only other Alameda brew i’ve had was an awesome impy stout."""
Alameda Papa's Old Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Old Ale;Alameda Brewing Co.;Tap at alameda brewpub Portland, OR. Nitroed. Very subtle aroma, but I detect notes of caramel and chocolate malt. Pours dark copper colored with a creamy, off-white head and good lacing. Rich, creamy mouthfeel with notes of caramel and some chocolate. Finishes smooth and clean. Good. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bear Republic Triple J Malt Liquor;Healdsburg, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Acetyl alcohol nose with lots of phenols. Almost moldy on the palate with more alcohol and phenols. Dirty and hot finish.
Bear Republic Triple J Malt Liquor;Healdsburg, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Bear Republic Brewing Company;tap@brewery. not sure why they’d name a beer after an australian radio station. piney aroma, a pretty hefty kero burn in the finish which reminded me of the time i drank some lamp oil that i was told was lemongrass liqueur. despite those bad memories i enjoyed it
Bear Republic Triple J Malt Liquor;Healdsburg, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Tap@Bear Reublic Brewpub. Well, for a malt liquor its very decent. Lots of alcohol in the nose and palate, but balanced by a good amount of hops, a hoppy malt liquor.
Bear Republic Triple J Malt Liquor;Healdsburg, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Bear Republic Brewing Company;This malt liquor pours with a deep golden body topped by a thin head with little lacing. The aroma is sweet and hoppy with slight malty notes and a nice grapefruit note. The flavor is slightly sweet, grapefruity and hoppy with piney notes and a sweet maltiness. Medium to full boddied, smooth and slighlty dry.
Bear Republic Triple J Malt Liquor;Healdsburg, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Now this is THE malt liqour of the microbrews. Pours a medium amber with a nice little white head. Fairly hoppy for a malt liqour, but that's what makes it stand out. I would actually drink a 40 of this if I could a bottle of the stuff.
Bear Republic Triple J Malt Liquor;Healdsburg, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Bear Republic Brewing Company;"Having tried two ""high-end"" malts in 2 days (the other being pizza ports brown bag malt) I have to say this is second to pizza port's as far as malts go. Pours a vibrant gold color with a nice creamy off-white head. Aroma is very mild with some cookie notes. Flavor is almost too sweet with some candy notes evident. Body is extremely syrupy. I'd have to say this reminded me more of a malt liquor than did pizza ports version, so I guess it's closer to style but not quite as good of beer overall. But not bad either."
Bear Republic Triple J Malt Liquor;Healdsburg, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Draught. Body is dark yellow. Aroma is moderately malty (cookie, cereal), moderately hoppy (grapefruit), with a note of alcohol. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter, slightly husky. Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. Throw some corn in a high-alc APA and call it a malt liquor...um...sure, fine.
Bear Republic Triple J Malt Liquor;Healdsburg, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Some corn, but not really DMS-like. A little buttery though. Very smooth and thickish, with a corn-syrup sweetness that was a bit much at times. Big hop bitterness helped out a little. Overall, much more drinkable than most other malt liquors I've had.
Bear Republic Triple J Malt Liquor;Healdsburg, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub. Medium gold. Oddly hoppy aroma, almost like straight hop pellets. Tast is also one of pure hops, with an almost greenish quality. But it isn't bitter, thanks to the sugar addition. Unique beer. When this gets enough samples, it will undoubtedly be the number 1 malt liquor on the site.
Bear Republic Triple J Malt Liquor;Healdsburg, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Gold pour with small, thin head. Sweet maltiness aroma along with nice floral hops. Alsohol bite and chewy hops in the finish.

Edwin Tucker's Empress Russian Porter;Newton Abbot, Devon, England;Porter - Imperial;Teignworthy Brewery;Bottle from Tucker’s Maltings, Newton Abbot, Devon. 2010 vintage. Cap comes off with barely a breath. Completely still and lifeless in the glass, as expected, and reminiscent of sump oil with a hint of brown in the shallows. So, so bountiful, thick and rich is the aroma. Sweet treacle and molasses, tawny port, kecap manis, Bovril™, Amarula™ liqueur and vanillin nuances tickle the nose into play. Oily and still in mouthfeel with a lean body and soft, powdery finish. Alcohol is vinous but restrained. Aftertaste is port-like, fruity and savoury with a hint of oak and charred wood. Mid-palate gleams with hints of Worcestershire sauce, bitter, dark chocolate, kecap manis and molasses with a light astringency and tartness on the swallow. Quite mouthfilling with a peppery spice melding it all together. Very much a slow-sipper and showing its age in style. A lovely English Imperial. Impressed! (33cL, no date stamp)
Shirataki Sake;Niigata-ken, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Shirataki Sake USA;Had this at Tonys Sushi in nyc. This was an excellent sake, very floral in nose and taste. Extremely smooth and clean.
Shirataki Sake;Niigata-ken, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Shirataki Sake USA;300ml bottle, $11. Very floral, fragrant nose, with hints of light fruits (kiwi, muscat grape, banana) and a calm violet. Likely the most fragrant sake I’ve had. Flowery taste is light on koji with a strong, thick finish. Dry. I definitely find some alcohol burn in this, as opposed to Austin Powers.
Shirataki Sake;Niigata-ken, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Shirataki Sake USA;"300mL Bottle @ Sakura, Eagle, ID: Crystal clear color. Nose is floral with notes of puffed corn, kiwi fruit, faint clean koji and light plum. The flavor is very clean, just a tiny hint of alcohol, light mineral and a distant citric acid tingle on the back of your throat. Banana, mellon; very clean. I’m surprised that this is a junmai. Neutral, semi-sweet but nearly dry mouthfeel. The tail is pleasant with a decent amount of umami and shows more of the junmai qualities of this sake."
Shirataki Sake;Niigata-ken, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Shirataki Sake USA;This sake has two big things going for it: it's totally clear, which is quite unusual for a mere Junmai Regular. Second, there is virtually no alcohol burn whatsoever, which is pretty unusual for ANY sake. Now to its downsides (come on, you knew they had to exist, otherwise it'd be a Daiginjo, right): there's very little aroma, but what is there is cotton candyish. More importantly, there isn't much of a flavor, except a light, smooth, simple drinkability. Slightly sweet with no puckering dryness. A delicate drinkability. Very nice - a real surprise! Tasting it side-by-side with the yellowish Kamoizumi Daiginjo, I have to say the cheaper Shirataki takes the cake! It must be the fact that Shirataki is from Niigata Prefecture. Every fantastic sake I sample seems to be from Niigata or Nada.
Edenton Horniblows Tavern American Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Edenton Brewing Company;23-Jun-06 (12 oz bottle: Obtained 25-Mar-06 in trade with Jonathan3584, thanks Jonathan!) Yet another mildly infected beer from Edenton. Funk and gentle tartness are obvious, but not overwhelming, but I don’t expect any funky tartness in my American pale ales. Behind the tartness and funk is a modest, dusty hoppiness, but it’s in the background and isn’t the first thing you notice. If this were supposed to be some funky farmhouse style, I might be tempted to be more lenient, but the flavor is not all that enjoyable and lacks character, and as a pale ale, it’s obviously infected. The funk is far more apparent in the nose, and because it definitely has the farmhouse character, I’m enjoying the smelly aroma. Aside from being overly carbonated, there’s also a strong dusty mouthfeel to this beer, and the sourness at least makes the palate somewhat clean. Dark orange-amber in color with small particles suspended in the beer and plenty of carbonation bubbles of all sizes rising at different speeds through the beer. Off-white head is of average size and settles to a film and ring while leaving a few small patches of lace on the glass. Despite the infection, this isn’t awful, but it’s still a drain pour anyway. I’m just not in the mood, and beside, the mistake-driven aroma is much more enjoyable than the flavor. Definitely a retry when I get around to it.

Edenton Horniblows Tavern American Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Edenton Brewing Company;This bottle was found at a local retailer for a lowly 99 cents, so I tried it! Upon opening it presented big caramel on the nose and a healthy dose of yeast with the hops lingering to the back. It poured a bright copper with a firm off white head. It was difficult to keep the sediment in the bottle, but it is too be expected with bottle conditioned beers. There is a rather germanic quality to the way the malt hits your palate, but the carbonation reminds me of some of the fizzier examples from Belgium. It finishes with a dryness you would not expect from a beer with this much malt sweetness, a very welcome surprise. I will be returning to the store later this week to buy the rest of the bottles.

Edenton Horniblows Tavern American Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Edenton Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours amber, off white head. Aroma is caramel, vanilla, hops, and malt. Flavor is malt, caramel, pine, and slight hops. Too sweet.
Edenton Horniblows Tavern American Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Edenton Brewing Company;Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a cloudy orange-copper color with a small tan head. The aroma is sour, nutty and lightly fruity. The flavor is sour nut, light grapefruit and floral hops. The finish is dry and bitter.
Southampton Yorkshire Pub Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southampton Publick House;On nitro tap at SPH. Pours a clear orange with a thick white nitro-y head. Aroma of bready malts, floral hops, tangy citrus. Flavor of pale malts, bread, doughy malts, light fruits. Smooth drinking. The nitro doesn’t really add to this beer (and probably takes away...) but I still enjoyed it. 7/4/7/4/14 [3.6/5]
Southampton Yorkshire Pub Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southampton Publick House;On draft at the brewpub. Pours a semi clear golden honey with a frosty medium sized white head. Aroma of barley, light honey and hops. Taste of barley, watery hops, grass notes and a touch of honey. Mild hoppy aftertaste.
Southampton Yorkshire Pub Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southampton Publick House;Tap @ SPH. Pours a creamy gold with a lingering creamy head - took a while to settle, as English ales are wont to do. Aroma was some light malt, grain, and nutty notes, but it wasn’t very strong. Taste is a creamy smooth combination of malt, a bit of grain, and a clean finish that reminded me of nuts. It’s a fantastic session ale and a good representation of the style.
Southampton Yorkshire Pub Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southampton Publick House;"Nitro at Waterfront Ale House. Copper color with a creamy off-white head, leaving speckled lacing. Grainy malt aroma with some red apple peel and floral scents. Caramel malt flavor with a slight hop backing; some fruity notes in the body. Creamy nitro palate. Nicely balanced session ale, but at the same time very standard and unexciting. The nitro might be ruining any of the subtler flavors."
Southampton Yorkshire Pub Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southampton Publick House;On tap at the SPH. Pours a clear golden amber with a thin, very creamy white head. Superb lacing down the entire glass. Very light aroma of fresh bread. The flavor is thankfully more pronounced than the aroma with fresh bread, malt and hops all in proper proportion. Super smooth mouthfeel with just enough bitterness and a nice crisp finish. Really good stuff.
Southampton Yorkshire Pub Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southampton Publick House;Body is a deep ruby amber with a tightly-packed, thick creamy head. Not much aroma. Flavor is smooth and crisp, with just enough hops to keep it interesting and a perfect complement of bready malts to balance it out. Palate is a bit thin and creamy. Finish is dry, bitter and sweet. This stuff just begs to be quaffed.
Southampton Yorkshire Pub Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southampton Publick House;Cask @ Brazen Head. Light golden in color with a little white head. Grainy, bready aroma. Hoppy malty flavor. Taste is well balanced. Finish is nutty and dry. Smooth tasting. Full bodied. Very drinkable. Nice.
Southampton Yorkshire Pub Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southampton Publick House;"Cask @ Brazen Head. Light gold in color with a small head (understandable for gravity feed) but still a 1/2"" of white foam. Aroma is a heady bread dough. Taste is perfectly balanced between the light bitterness and the sweet grains used. The thing I find most amazing about this real ale, is the ability to maintain consistant throughout the pint. Some nuttiness and a bit of dryness as well. Really smooth and my favorite at the fest."
Southampton Yorkshire Pub Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southampton Publick House;Cask: yeasty and full of minerals, dry and refreshing. Nice, but a little bit too light IMHO. Nicely balanced.
Southampton Yorkshire Pub Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Southampton Publick House;Cask at Long Island Real Ale Festival - very dry, biscuity aroma, almost smells of fresh bread - quite full-bodied for a bitter, or a beer for such a low abv - crisp, citrusy hops combine with a bready malt backbone to make this a wonderfully drinkable ale - a great session beer from a great brewery.
Edenton Uncle Nuts Nut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Edenton Brewing Company;From old notes. ++ + Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a flat brown color with a small foamy beige head. The aroma was faintly malty with a touch of malt. The flavor was a bit sour and tangy with hints of malt, bread and nut. Short finish. Light to medium body. Blah.
Edenton Uncle Nuts Nut Brown Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Edenton Brewing Company;Had this one years ago and it holds a special place in my heart as it was one of the first craft beers that I had. A buddy bough it with a fake along with some other stuff and it was a downward spiral. Remember it having a nutty character, lightly bready and sweet.
Edenton King Davids Red;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Edenton Brewing Company;"Deep hazy red coloured body with a strong copper tint and a nice oily tan head that tops the beer. Aroma of fresh cascade hops, caramel malt, nuts and some raisins. Medium-bodied; Strong hops up front in the taste followed by a nice chunk of malt along with some toffee and nuttiness in the back. Aftertaste shows the hop bitterness packed with some of the nutty maltiness. Overall - a good beer. Full of complexity from look to aftertaste...great for the style which I usually dislike. Overall, definitely worth trying if you can find it - plus it makes me look forward to the other beers from this brewery.

Edenton King Davids Red;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Edenton Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy, reddish-orange. Nice head, doesn’t last long, but leaves a nice lace. Nose of malt but sour - not sure what that is. Taste is nice and malty but with a hop bite, but not like a pale ale. A bit more harsh than I expected.
Edenton King Davids Red;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Edenton Brewing Company;Nice aroma, but the flavor did not live up to it. Malt and hop balance and flavor are excellent, but it seems like theres a little musty soapiness in the flavor that throws it off a bit.

Edenton King Davids Red;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Edenton Brewing Company;Super-cloudy with a small head - a little on the soapy side.

Edenton Joseph Hewes Revolutionary Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Edenton Brewing Company;Hmph. You’d think a beer named after a historical figure would have more character, or would at least be palatable. This is mostly ass, I must say. Gold and mildly hazy on the pour, with a ripe yeasty aroma that promises good things. But this one is either way past its prime or just, well, ass.
Edenton Joseph Hewes Revolutionary Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Edenton Brewing Company;"The first time I cracked one of these open it sucked frankly. However, i was looking in one of the remaining bottles and realized that there was some sediment in there that i dumped in last time. So, round two. Pours a thick golden brew. Definitely some chacater to it, sort of hazy. not bad. The head is hard to get if you pour carefully enough not to stir up that stuff. Thin and white, not bad. The aroma is sort of ill begotten. Sort of sour (bad), some hop bite, mainly just this funky smell. Unfortunately the taste suffers the same fate. Just weird. The palate has an interesting twang to it, but not enough to be like ""wow, thats good"". The finish is just there, nothing to be said about it. Overall it just tastes weird. Not complex, just like it went bad (maybe/hopefully it has)."
Edenton Joseph Hewes Revolutionary Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Edenton Brewing Company;Trade from Ross. Glugs out of the bottle and still no head.

Edenton Joseph Hewes Revolutionary Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Edenton Brewing Company;Bottle from ross - murky golden with no head at all - musty, earthy aroma, and a slight quality that seems like yeast at first, but starts to seem more like a bacterial sourness after a few sniffs - mild fruity flavor, with a decent hop combination - light bready, cask-ale-like yeastiness - watery finish, though - I think that if I had this on cask it would be a lot more enjoyable.

Edenton Helles Angel;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Edenton Brewing Company;12 oz bottle for $3 from D’s in Regent Square. On the front it says pale golden lager but this does not describe the unfiltered glory contained within. This stuff pours like a quality unfiltered wheat beer, with gunk on the bottom and all. What a swirling light brownish show. Beautiful attractive sweet aroma. The girl on the front is definitely german and she looks like my wife. The aroma of this is hardtack candy sweet, like sweet fruity candy canes. Wow, has a really good flavor impact. This lends itself to a slight bitterness on the finish of each swig. However, it does not build, it is mild and controlled. Unlike many beers, who’s aroma does not match the flavor, this does. I really like this brew, a brew that I was not particularly interested in buying! Never judge a book by it’s cover. Almost as good as Lowenbrau, possibly better because of the appearance. Would not hesitate to buy again. Way better than Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold and Victory V Lager.
Edenton Helles Angel;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Edenton Brewing Company;bottle. Pale golden, with a thick white head. Malty aroma with wheat and orange zest. Fairly sweet, bready, yeasty, with mild hops. Malty finish. Refreshing, but otherwise nothing special.

Edenton Helles Angel;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Edenton Brewing Company;A hazy golden pour with a white foamy head.. A bannana paper aroma with a hint of malt. A slightly bitter off flavor. A weak and fizzy palate. Not a great beer but a drinker for sure.
Edenton Helles Angel;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Edenton Brewing Company;A cloudy yellow appearance with a white head. A lemon and hay aroma.

Kingston Autumn Strong Ale;Kingston, Ontario, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Kingston Brewing Co.;Cask. Opens with fairly bright fruity tones. Lingers on in a decent body. As a full pint it is cumbersome. I get the feeling these extract-brewed KBC beers are all a little unconvincing, lacking some ’oomph’ in the finish and I suppose naturalness.
Kingston Autumn Strong Ale;Kingston, Ontario, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Kingston Brewing Co.;Cask. Very dark brown, with a great fluffy beige head and decent lacing on the glass. Mild aroma is a touch muted, of sweet dark malt, very light toasty notes and mild alcohol notes. Surpisingly bitter, sweet dark malt middle with a finish that is decidedly on the bitter side with a very light acidic note. Creamy light palate, served just a touch too warm even for cask. Not quite sure what to make of this one, pleasant but a touch bland at the same time.

Clear, golden with a medium large, frothy, almost stable, white head. Faint, slightly sweetish and a bit grassy-spicy aroma of grains and some straw. Slightly sweetish, moderately bitter, gently grassy-spicy and a little fruity-floral taste of grains, some straw and a touch of lemon peel, followed by a short, gently bitter, quite grassy-spicy finish. Almost medium-bodied, smooth, slightly creamy and gently effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Nice, classic Pils, not as aromatic as their ""Übersee"" variant though."
Störtebeker Pilsener-Bier;Stralsund, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Störtebeker Braumanufaktur;Easy drinking, light beer with nice bitterness. Colour is a bit to light, but taste is pleasing.
Störtebeker Pilsener-Bier;Stralsund, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Störtebeker Braumanufaktur;The bottle looks exciting and so does the beer but the taste is not living up to that expectation. For me it was just a middle of the road pilsener.
Störtebeker Pilsener-Bier;Stralsund, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Störtebeker Braumanufaktur;Review based on the BJCP2015 guidelines (style 5D). Bottle 50 cl - Batch L2351835 (BBF 23.05.2019). AROMA: medium-low green-like hop aroma, followed by a medium-low grainy and slightly sweet malt background. APPEARANCE: gold color and translucent. medium-low white head with average retention. TASTE: medium-low grainy malt flavour with very low herbal hop presence. medium bitterness with a relatively dry and slightly bitter finish. PALATE: medium-light body with medium to medium-high carbonation. OVERALL: an ok german pils with more hop presence on the aroma than the flavour maybe because its nearing its shelf life best-before date.
Titletown Todd and Bills Excellent IPA;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Titletown Brewing Company;Light golden color with a small white head. Smells like Murphy's Oil Soap. Not exactly a bad think, but interesting nonetheless. Flavors actually follow with a sweet pale malt and orange bitterness.
Titletown Toasted Oats and Molasses Brown Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Titletown Brewing Company;Chestnut color with a small dark cream colored head. Rich fruitcake aroma with vanilla and brown sugar undertones. Dark dark malt flavors. Nothing real complex. Warming sweet finish.
Titletown Winter Warmer;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Titletown Brewing Company;Another fantastic offering from Dave and Bill. The beers a clear but dark mahogany colour. Some barely noticeable sediment floating around. Aroma is rich and nutty. Toffee and spices abundant. Flavour is smooth and easy going down. Very faint alcohol near the finish, but otherwise plenty rich nutty sweetness all throughout.
Titletown Winter Warmer;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Titletown Brewing Company;On tap at Titletown. Pours a rich ruddy color with thin off white head. Aroma is of dark fruit, clove, cinnamon and light banana. Taste is much the same but the clove is over the top and ruins it a bit. Alcohol. Is well hidem but the balance is way off with the cinnamon. This one was 7% .
Titletown Winter Warmer;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Titletown Brewing Company;Nice to see this one returned after six years and still a weizenbock. On draught at the Titletown brewpub in downtown Green Bay, WI. Pours a hazy brownish amber colored brew with a thick off-white head that slowly dissipates to a thin ring and film top. Aroma of banana esters, some Hefe yeast, cloves, caramel malt and a hint of vanilla. Taste is full bodied, soft carbonation with flavors of toasted banana, toffee, caramel malt, vanilla and yeast. Finish is semi-sweet with a lingering banana/yeast aftertaste. The 2009 version is 7.0% ABV compared to the classic 2003 12% version.
Titletown Winter Warmer;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Titletown Brewing Company;"Amber, light-clear; small yellowish rim. Buttery nose, caramel. Sweet, and an extra taste - well, I know there's palm sugar in this, but I definitely seem to get coeur de palmier/palmheart. Extremely well-bodied and yet dangerously drinkable. Amazing - it's not overly sweet, and yet it's a perfect sugar-aromated winter warmer."
Titletown Winter Warmer;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Titletown Brewing Company;Slightly hazed honey color with a smallish white head. Orange blossom and honey malt aroma. Floral perfumy flavors that lead to a warming finish. Not a lot of depth but just light and warming.
Bumthang Red Panda Weissbier (Weiss Beer);Jakka, Bhutan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bumthang Brewery;Typical wheat beer scent and appearance. Mild flavour which does not linger. OK.
Bumthang Red Panda Weissbier (Weiss Beer);Jakka, Bhutan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bumthang Brewery;On draft in Thimphu. Pours a cloudy gold with an off white head. Aroma of clove. Flavors are white bread and chili. One of the tastier beers in Bhutan.
Bumthang Red Panda Weissbier (Weiss Beer);Jakka, Bhutan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bumthang Brewery;Bottle - Soft wheat grains. Cloudy yellow with a decent white head. Soft wheat, touch of manure and a soft finish. Very light and soft.
Bumthang Red Panda Weissbier (Weiss Beer);Jakka, Bhutan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bumthang Brewery;650ml bottle @ the office. Pours a cloudy yellow colour with a small white head. Nose hints of citrus towards a phenolic nature with some cheesy notes. Flavour definitely presents phenols and some banana. Nothing great, nothing special.
Bumthang Red Panda Weissbier (Weiss Beer);Jakka, Bhutan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bumthang Brewery;650ml bottle at Brian’s office. Pours a hazy blond with a white head. Aroma is phenolic, some plastic, and some flowery notes. Same taste. Bad.
Bumthang Red Panda Weissbier (Weiss Beer);Jakka, Bhutan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bumthang Brewery;650mL bottle, pours a cloudy yellowish blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out some phenols, metallic notes, a little cheese, and clove. Flavour is fairly metallic and phenolic, with lots of plastic, some metallic notes, a touch of banana and clove. Lots of off-notes going on here, though it’s inoffensive. Not good.
Bumthang Red Panda Weissbier (Weiss Beer);Jakka, Bhutan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bumthang Brewery;My Bottom Line: Bananas and light cloves ride this Weissbier’s creamy feel, leading to wooden, herbal hops and their impression of dryness. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam covers the cloudy hay blond. -All the right notes are hit for the style. -Carbonation is a tad lower than average for the style though. -Drinkability is quite high. Bottle and on tap at a cheese shop next to the brewery.
Bumthang Red Panda Weissbier (Weiss Beer);Jakka, Bhutan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bumthang Brewery;Draft at this cute café near the brewery, which sadly was closed. Hazy, sort of a dull tan colour. Thin head. Aroma is a fair bit of banana and apple. Thinnish for a Weissbier, with a finish that could be dry or could be tart, but ends up being neither. Still, a clean weissbier.
Bumthang Red Panda Weissbier (Weiss Beer);Jakka, Bhutan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bumthang Brewery;Bottle shared at Cotteridge convention 05/03/2016. Thanks to Scopey. A translucent yellow / straw coloured pour with a fine white head. Aroma is peppery, doughy malts, earthy straw. Flavour is composed of banana and doughy wheat. Palate is thin, tangy, chalky with highish carbonation. Not a fan.
Bumthang Red Panda Weissbier (Weiss Beer);Jakka, Bhutan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bumthang Brewery;Bottle split at CC2, 05/03/16, thanks to Scopester. Hazed golden yellow with a moderate off White covering.Nose is yeast esters, light peppery spice, grain husk. Taste comprises bitter lemon, yeasty vibe, straw, clove, spice. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close. A touch harsh and unrefined but makes a change from the usual pale lager obscure country tick !
Gwatkin Kingston Black Cider;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Gwatkin Cider (inc Abbey Dore Ales);Not exactly a precise review, just a valutation based on my personal taste.
Gwatkin Kingston Black Cider;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Gwatkin Cider (inc Abbey Dore Ales);Pours clear blonde, no real head. Smell is dry, intense apples. taste is sweet-ish, very dry. full mouthfeel. This dry of ciders is not what I prefer, but this particular one is OK, still. very low carbonation. Not bad.

Gwatkin Kingston Black Cider;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Gwatkin Cider (inc Abbey Dore Ales);Puuh. Das ist wieder mal etwas so Spezielles, das so heftig nach Stroh und vergorenem Apfel zieht, so dass es für einen teils echt schwierig ist, mehr als einen Schluck auf einmal zu nehmen. Nein, Moment - eigentlich habe ich mich gezwungen, es zu stürzen, denn dieses essigaffine Aromen mit der ganzen Muffigkeit war mehr als speziell. Äpfelchen ? Puuh...
Gwatkin Kingston Black Cider;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Gwatkin Cider (inc Abbey Dore Ales);Bottle from minutemat - many thanks! The cider has got a deep hazy orange-amber colour with a medium body and low carbonation. Aroma of tart apples and oak. Taste of tart, green apples, citric, acid, fields and tress. Harsh finish with some watery and thin feeling. Refreshing.
Gwatkin Kingston Black Cider;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Gwatkin Cider (inc Abbey Dore Ales);500ml bottle. Orangey golden colour, short-lived fizzy white foam head and aroma of sourish apple, vanilla, barnyard. Taste is tangy apple, with woody oak, barnyard, earthy notes, bittersweet with lots of tannin. Mouth puckering, slightly oily mouthfeel, medium bodied, low carbonation, sour dry tannic finish. Quite drinkable.
Gwatkin Kingston Black Cider;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Gwatkin Cider (inc Abbey Dore Ales);500ml bottle at home on a sunny Autumn afternoon. Typically rich taste from Gwatkin, even for a Kingston Black, with a familiarly sharp nuclear sour tang that shoots to the back of the throat and zings you repeatedly as you make a valiant attempt to swallow. Never been a fan of Gwatkin and this one definitely does not do this apple justice.
Barker Give Us A Kuss Oatmeal Stout;Fredonia, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Barker Brew Company;Pours opaque black with a 2cm light brown head. Sweet lacing!

Barker Transgressional Amber;Fredonia, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Barker Brew Company;Pours a transparent amber with tiny white head thats quickly dissipating. Robust aroma--like pine needles. Start is very tangy with pine and citrus flavors. Very tangy and complex. Hops in the finish. Another great brew! Had this on tap at the brewpub.

Bear Creek Hibernation Winter Ale;Redmond, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Bear Creek Brewing Company;22oz bottle. Slightly murky brown sugar and caramel colored with a tan toasty head. The nose offers an assortment of bready Christmas-like aromas: nutmeg is strongest, but caramel, graham cracker and cinnamon are present, as is a sweet thick apple and pear scent. Flavor is pretty much spot on with the aroma: some apples and cinnamon, heavy nutmeg, light honey as well. Texture is moderately thick, smooth and syrupy, heavy on the tongue, finishing with a nice, even woody aged character. I liked this one quite well.
Bear Creek Hibernation Winter Ale;Redmond, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Bear Creek Brewing Company;"I really want to like this brewery... Pours a mahogany with a decent head and some nice lacing. Aroma is very spicy, as in lots of spices; nutmeg, cloves...with malt and...apples? Gotta keep reminding myself of the style and not compare this to other standard Winter styles. Flavor is interesting. Definately spicy, as in it’s almost like drinking mulled cider with a beer kicker. Very fruity, also, as in apples, bananas, some raisins and dates. Palate is full, for sure. The spices don’t wash down quite as I would like so it’s almost cloying. Overall... You know, I gotta admit, it grows on you a bit. I hated the first few sips but it’s really not bad at all - given the style listed here."
Bear Creek Hibernation Winter Ale;Redmond, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Smells mostly of fruit and cloves with some roasted malts, although not al-together pleasing due to its thin nature. The cloves, nutmeg, or whatever other holiday spices are in there carry over into the flavor, but fails to hold up respectfully against the malt. Too much of a good thing here, good holiday spirit, just decorated to the point where it becomes tacky. Over all, the cloves and spices are strong enough that it ruins the solidity of the beer.
Bear Creek Hibernation Winter Ale;Redmond, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Spicy, musky aroma. Light copper color. Taste is all cloves and spices. Came off very minty, to the point that it was a little overdone. Almost toothpaste-like in taste. I see what they were trying to do with this, I just think it went a little too far.
Bear Creek Hibernation Winter Ale;Redmond, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Bottle pours a deep red caramel, medium foamy sand colored head, minor bits floating about, with fairly attractive lacing.   Huge amounts of orange peel and clove in the aroma.   Hints of holiday spices, nutmeg and cinnamon are also present.   Heavily spiced, with spice, spice, and MORE spice.   A bit overdone me thinks.   Other than that, lots and lots of orange peel.   Decent body and mouthfeel, but its really hard to tell whats underneath this one.   Spices are nice, but its a tad overspiced.   Finishes, you guessed it, spicy!
Bear Creek Hibernation Winter Ale;Redmond, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Wooo mama, this one suprised me. Deep deep brown color. A full nose of apples, cinammon and a hint of cloves. The inital sip set me back. FULL BODIED and sweet. A heavy beer to say the least. Apple, caramel flavours dance across the tounge, leading to a hearty malty sweet finish. A DEFINETE Winter beer. Not overly complex, but no the less damn solid.
Bear Creek Hibernation Winter Ale;Redmond, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Dark murky brown color. Cinnamon, brown sugar, and bananas in the nose. Heavy on sweet flavors that include, cinnamon, bananas, and candy. Somewhat light to medium bodied with an oily texture on the palate. No carbonation. A short and sweetly flavored finish.
Bear Creek Hibernation Winter Ale;Redmond, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Bear Creek Brewing Company;"Dark and thick, this cinnamon, cherry, sweet drink calls to mind an ""old-fashioned"" -- the whiskey drink. While it is not my favorite style (sorry I don't know how to classify the style), I have enjoyed this beer immensely. It is definitely worth a try if your out for something dark and sweet. Also, it has a similar flavor to the ""Twin Creeks Ale"", also produced by Bear Creek."

Winthrop Goat Wall Oat Stout;Winthrop, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Winthrop Brewing Company;Pacific Northwest Vacation 2007 8/21/2007: Winthrop Goat Wall Oat Stout pours a murky chocolate brown color with a lasting, creamy, tan-colored head. The roasted malt aroma also smells a lot like coffee with a bit of creamer added. The flavor is like oatmeal with chocolate chunks in it. The dry and roasty finish has a coffee-like flavor to it. This beer has a medium-light to medium body and is a bit watery here and there, but somehow it is still smooth and creamy. This is a pretty solid oatmeal stout. Draught sample at the Winthrop Brewing Company in Winthrop, Washington. Rating #3 for this beer...
Winthrop Goat Wall Oat Stout;Winthrop, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Winthrop Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Great roasted malt aroma. Pretty good oatmeal stout. Smooth with plenty of taste.
Winthrop Goat Wall Oat Stout;Winthrop, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Winthrop Brewing Company;"This beer is still a mystery to me - it's nowhere to be seen on the Winthrop site, but I had a pint of this during Oktoberfest in Leavenworth, WA (I have the stolen menu from ""Visconti's"" sitting right in front of me) so until I find eveidence suggesting otherwise, I'm rating this beer. Seeing as though it was brewed deep within the woods it may seem only natural, but this was extremely resiny with this notes of pine. Along with all that grassiness I must admit there was a little intrusive bitterness as well, almost like cold espresso or VERY dark chocolate. If anything, I think this could use a little down time, some aging and some serious mellowing."

There is nothing distinct in the aroma. The flavor has a good balance of hops and malt, but nothing really sticks out. This beer has a medium body and an average palate. The verdict: Boring. Draught sample at The Boundary Bay Brewery & Bistro in Bellingham, Washington. Rating #7 for this beer...
Boundary Bay Traverse Red Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Boundary Bay Brewery;Pours as a hazy dark amber/red. Coppery taste, very strong hops. If you don’t like beers with a lot of flavor, stay away. Fortunately, I do, and this was no exception. Just the right amount of bite and a sweet finish. A little bit too hoppy at times (even for me) but nonetheless a solid effort.
Boundary Bay Traverse Red Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Boundary Bay Brewery;"GCBF. Nice pour, great colour. I love red beers. Aroma was very hoppy, almost eye-watering. Loose head that disappeared quickly and laced not at all on my poor, abused taster glass. Mouthfeel was a slight bit oily, but fresh. A nice malt profile was struggling to show it’s lovely taste, but was hammered down by a monster hoppiness....it could have been nice, but the ""mungy"" taste that I associate with high alpha varieties made me want a bit of a chaser. This is a decent beer on the cusp of greatness. But the hop profile wrecked it for me. Not too hoppy...don’t get me wrong. Just not a great hop blend."
Boundary Bay Traverse Red Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Boundary Bay Brewery;Hazy dark amber colour with a rich, caramel head. Fresh pale and chocolate malt aroma. Earthy, chocolate malt flavour with foresty hops. Kind of mild in the bitterness department for using such a high alpha (Warrior) hop. Way too middle of the road.
Boundary Bay Traverse Red Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Boundary Bay Brewery;Tap at GCBF. Cloudy reddish-amber beer with thin tan head. Fresh grassy hop aroma, with some bready malts backing up the hops. Flavour is quite herbal, grassy/hay aroma with a touch of pine resin. Nice brew.

Nice earthy malt nose with light hops.Sweet start,earthy and sweet malt profile, good hop bitterness with a lasting finish.Complex, with great body. Both the hops and the malt linger in the finish. Wonderful Stuff!!! A must try
Boundary Bay Traverse Red Ale;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Boundary Bay Brewery;This isn't a very big change from the original red other than the fact the hopped the hell out of the thing which is good in its own right, but the low malt levels of the original is what really needed work on, not the hoppiness.
Brasserie de la Côte L'écume du Léman;Vullierens, Switzerland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie de la Côte;I bought this bottle at the produit du terroir. I drank it at home during this hot day. This beer is special, you have some contrast with the taste. When you pour the beer you don’t have foam, the body is yellow-orange and troubled. You can smell the malt and there is a side of roggen beer, there is a note of plum and apricot, the final note is burnt and it is sour and watery, presence of piece of yeast. I drank this beer again at the Tulip party, at Morges. I could say that I was again a disappointed about this beer. The taste is unbalanced, tart and sour, lack of aromas, not enough coriander and orange peel, tasteof gases and copper at the final, not a success.

Saint-Omer Eastenders ESP Strong Brew;Saint Omer, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Saint-Omer;Can. A pathetic attempt to copy Carlsberg Special Brew. Even at 9.2% there is little mouthfeel. The alcohol is also surprisingly well hidden, felt more in the gentle warmth inside your body and a giddy high in the head, than in the flavour. A fairly decent malty aroma. Not a bad beer - and apparantly very cheap - but nothing world class. I wouldn't say no to another though!
Saint-Omer Eastenders ESP Export;Saint Omer, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint-Omer;Just out of information this beer has never been made by St Omer especially the one in the can up untill end of 2010 ESP history first brewed in bottles under a different coloured label andwas made in Belgium by Wieze near Gent then was brewed by a small brewery owner great guy called oliver and forget the name but it was something like evan malmaison the brewery is no longer there but it was in the north of france then due to production problems GBM in roubaix france brewed it in bottles this is whent the white boxes came with the same as the can the first cans was actually made by Karlsbrew in france in saverne who also did the bottles ( cans actually done in thier german brewery) this is also when the ESP 9.2 was born and was made both in cans and bottles and the cases was a darker yellow Just so you know who i am i am the son of Dave West the man who started this beer and had alot to do with the concept of the beer marketing and also delt with the breweries not the company went bankcrup in 2010 so not sure if st omer bought out the rights of this beer but im sure if they did they would have taken out the word Eastenders on it as that was our trading name in calais where we was the only ones who sold this beer
Saint-Omer Eastenders ESP Export;Saint Omer, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint-Omer;(25cl stubbie) There are some excellent French beers, like 3Monts & Jenlaine. this is soulless lager. Ok , but annoying when it obscures real stuff.
Saint-Omer Eastenders ESP Export;Saint Omer, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint-Omer;Bottle, 25cl, presumably from Calais. E.S.P seems like your standard cheap French stubby - gold, clear colour with a hoppy, freshly cut grass aroma. Clean, crisp and refreshing taste, with a slight hoppiness, though generally shortlived flavour. Slight bitterness catches you in the finish, though again not for long. Not the best, but definitely preferable to a standard Macrobrew....
Saint-Omer Eastenders ESP Export;Saint Omer, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Saint-Omer;Can. Eastenders is a supermarket store in Calais which sells cheap beer and fags to boatloads of Brits. Only 1% of the customers are French. The ESP name - which stands for either Eastenders Strong Pils or Extra Sex Please (Dave West, the supermarket owner has claimed both!) - was the cause of a court case with Fuller's who felt that ESP was a little too close to ESB. I doubt if many people would become confused between an ale in a bottle and a cheap lager in a can, but the court thought they might and agreed with Fuller's, so preventing Dave West from selling the beer on British soil. Anyway, it's a typical lager product from the Saint Omer brewery. Nothing nasty about it - clean and palatable, though lacking any character or real flavour. I was given a couple of cans by a customer - Eastenders is really not my type of shop!
John Harvards Manchester Crazy Cascadian Ale;Manchester, Connecticut, United States;IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Manchester;"Draught: An interesting beer. It starts with a fairly potent aroma of piney hops. It pours a hazy copper color. There is the tight, white head that you get with nitro beers. I don't know if it ""settled"", as it was probably poured a few minutes prior to it getting to my table. There was a fairly up-front taste of the hops. There was a creaminess that you don't usually associate with an IPA. An interesting and good take on an IPA."
Ohyama (Big Mountain) Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;Tsuruoka-shi, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Tokubetsu;Kato Kahachiro Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Another awesome bottle at the Sushi Bar thanks to Jen and Jordan. Pours a light yellow color, clear. A sweet nose, no heat really, grainy. The flavor was similarly less fruity and more dry paper and grains, some rose petals. Nice. Very cool, not much alcohol showing.
Ohyama (Big Mountain) Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;Tsuruoka-shi, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Tokubetsu;Kato Kahachiro Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottle ($9) from my local gas-station. Pours crystal clear and pure with some legs. Aroma is sweet koji and nutty almond with vanilla and light florals. Taste is medium to sweet, with koji and umami, very neutral flavored, albeit balanced. Like drinking thick, somewhat sweet water. A hint of coconut pulp. Syrupy, but not super complex.
Ohyama (Big Mountain) Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;Tsuruoka-shi, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Tokubetsu;Kato Kahachiro Shuzo Co., Ltd.;300ml bottle at Tonys Sushi in nyc. Very clear. This was somewhat floral. Light taste and had slight alcohol note.
Ohyama (Big Mountain) Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;Tsuruoka-shi, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Tokubetsu;Kato Kahachiro Shuzo Co., Ltd.;slightly yellow body. Light aroma of rice, koji, and fruits. Apricot in the body with rice and strong koji flavor. Fruits on the finish.
Ohyama (Big Mountain) Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;Tsuruoka-shi, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Tokubetsu;Kato Kahachiro Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Almost totally clear, with just the tiniest hint of yellow color. Aroma is both floral and fruity, honeydew with a tang of green apple peel. Flavor echoes the aroma but it has a very rich flavor, with almost a creaminess to it. A bit sweeter and more acidity than most sakes I have tried so far, but they balance nicely.
Ohyama (Big Mountain) Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;Tsuruoka-shi, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Tokubetsu;Kato Kahachiro Shuzo Co., Ltd.;I got a clear color from my bottle, fairly watery appearance on the legs though. Nose of light koji & melon, apricot & peach. Full bodied taste with a little umami, light sting of alcohol on the palate, seems a bit sweet due to the florals but in the finish it definately is dry. I found it fairly balanced all considering with some delicate but simple tendencies. I had this 300ml bottle at Sakura in Boise along with some maguro sashimi. Yum!
Ohyama (Big Mountain) Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;Tsuruoka-shi, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Tokubetsu;Kato Kahachiro Shuzo Co., Ltd.;With a sake meter value (nihonshu-do) of +8, this is a rather dry sake with a hint of yellowish color in the glass. Slightly rich and just a tad buttery, there is a faint trail of sweetness in the finish. With its acidity right in the middle of the spectrum, Ohyama doesn't come across as heavy on the palate. Its fatal flaw is that its aroma is almost solely of alcohol, an unforgivable sin for a Japanese tokubetsu junmaishu.
Hitorimusume (Only Daughter) Junmai Nigori Sake;IBARAKA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Yamanaka Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Ugly pour. Light nose of melon and plum. Tastes of fleshy plum, some melon, grainy texture. Dirty rice. Dishwater. Lime. Floaties galore. Not great palate. I really not impressive.
Hitorimusume (Only Daughter) Junmai Nigori Sake;IBARAKA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Yamanaka Shuzo Co., Ltd.;This bottled Sake from a bottle shop poured a head of no head bubbles that were fully diminished and left behind a uncarbonated hazy white colored body and no lacing. The nice aroma was rice floral and polished rice. The mildly vinous mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a lingering vinous aftertaste. The nice flavor contained notes of polished rice rice mildly vinous and alcohol. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.
Hitorimusume (Only Daughter) Junmai Nigori Sake;IBARAKA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Yamanaka Shuzo Co., Ltd.;720mL Bottle: Paid about $22 for this. Pours a weird flat and dull frosted powerade color, no particles, yet still unfiltered, doesn’t really settle too much. The nose is fairly fruity with a touch of alcohol and some melon, plum flower and light dry koji grain. The mouthfeel initially has a strong acidic punch, followed by a dry dusty finish. The flavor has a light touch of alcohol and a glimpse of umami, but doesn’t quite impress you enough before the dryness takes over. The zesty snappy acidicty is the main deterant here for me. Dry acidic nigori? What’s the point, eh? It’s an odd one, but we’ll see how much of this 720 I can drink in one sitting...
Hitorimusume (Only Daughter) Junmai Nigori Sake;IBARAKA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Yamanaka Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Light floral aroma with a scent of paper. This Nigori is unimpressive, but at least it's better than the awful Hakusan Nigori garbage selling for $4.99 at my local sake purveyor. The taste is mild and dry with hints of bitterness. Not necessarily all that light, this is a thicker, semi-creamy Nigori not for lovers of ultra-rich Nigori. Most are creamier than this one. So-so.
Tsukinokatsura Junmai Tokubetsu Nigori Sake;Kyoto, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Masuda Tokubei Shoten (Tsukinokatsura);Bought a 180ml portion in a Kyoto liquor store. Sparkling nigori sake, relatively dry, great umami & rice flavor from this unfiltered drink. Alcohol is present in the flavor, but klar, it's 17%. Highly recommendable.
Tsukinokatsura Junmai Tokubetsu Nigori Sake;Kyoto, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Masuda Tokubei Shoten (Tsukinokatsura);300 ml bottle from Takimoto. CO2 released upon opening. Very thick, ricy nose, koji, some spice. Very full. Deeply cloudy, white and milky. Lovely fruity flavor surprises me. Orange and lemon, plum, rice, vanilla yogurt, slightlynfunky. Very creamy, with spritzy carbonation too. Quite lemony and really very nice. Hope I don’t get a huge load of gunk at the bottom!
Tsukinokatsura Junmai Tokubetsu Nigori Sake;Kyoto, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Masuda Tokubei Shoten (Tsukinokatsura);A true rarity in the world of sake - carbonation! There are only two others I know of besides the Tsukinokatsura. The aroma is of alcohol and parchment. The taste is, well, you’d better brace yourself, because it’s the weirdest thing you could ever expect from a sake. The first oddity is the fizziness (which is just totally incongruous with sake and comes as a surprise even you’re expecting it). Next, there’s a bracing alcohol slap and a creamy texture with little butteriness. The astringency is quite high, leaving much mouth-puckering. It’s flaw is a failure to adequately hide its 17% abv, but I enjoyed the rarity of this sparkling nigori.
Tsukinokatsura Junmai Tokubetsu Nigori Sake;Kyoto, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Masuda Tokubei Shoten (Tsukinokatsura);Wow! Bright, beautiful white cloudyness with teeming action in the glass -- whorls of clouds like a little universe in your palm. Some mildly effervescent sour pears and babyfood cracked fresh from grandma's mason jars. joyous! More alcohlic and lemon citric as it warms. Thanks a bunch, Scott! This was very special.
Free State Holiday Ale 2003;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Scottish Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Lovely, if slightly thin, scottish ale. Subtle estery dark fruit, extremely malty body and lasting finish. Head diminished quickly. I wanted and expected more spice and a fuller taste from the holiday ale. Very drinkable, I believe crack was used as an adjunct to create longing as part of the palate.
Free State Holiday Ale 2003;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Scottish Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Sweetly malty aroma, dark, vinous and fruity, with some brown sugar and toffee, light banana esters, slight roastiness and chocolate. Deep, dark red color, clear, with a slight but creamy head and sparse lacing. Flavor profile is almost entirely malty, sweet and dark, with notes of raisin, banana, cinnamon apple, toffee, licorice and vanilla. Very lightly spicy and somewhat syrupy finish, overall bitterness is negligible. Silky smooth mouthfeel, low effervescence, gently warming and medium-full body. Drinkable. Reminiscent of elements found in other beers such as McEwan's Scotch Ale and Old Peculier.

Malty, toasty nose with notes of dark bread, roasted grain, wort and a touch of brown sugar. Malty, slightly roasted taste with dark bread, raisins, dried fruit and wort. Short finish with low bitterness. Thin body, not overly sweet. A decent low alcohol Christmas lager, but not very exciting.
Spendrups Julbrygd 3.5%;Grängesberg, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Spendrups Bryggeri;Can enjoyed with hanniku on the boat (from Hemköp in T-Centralen). Amber colour, huge beige head. Aroma is caramel malts, vegetables and some mild hints of metal. Flavour is rubber, caramel malts and paper. A bit boring.
Snipes Mountain Coyote Moon;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;There was heavy, thick sediment in the bottle. It pours a very foamy head with half the glass full of head. The aroma is dirt, chocolate and nuts. The taste is sour. The texture is super fizzy. I may be a bad bottle. I will try to find another to compare.
Snipes Mountain Coyote Moon;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;(Draught) Pours a dark brown body with a medium beige head. Aroma of mustiness, toasted grain, caramel, and cocoa. Flavor of roasted malt, nuts, light raisins, chocolate, and grain.
Snipes Mountain Coyote Moon;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;On tap at GABF (listed as a Mild Ale and competing in said category). Pours with a hazed brown body with a tan head. Aromas are bready, nutty, grassy and a bit grainy. Flavors are grainy, toffee, caramel, nutty and bready. Medium bubbles. Decent sessionable malty beer.

Snipes Mountain Coyote Moon;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;On tap at Tap House in Seattle. Dark amber in color. Aroma was pretty light, with some brown malt and fruit. Flavor was very fruity with a bit of caramel and nuts. A touch of flowers in the end. Not a huge fan.
Snipes Mountain Coyote Moon;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;Very dark brown pour from TapHouse Grill in Seattle, this rather heavy, nutty brown ale starts well but finishes slightly less wonderfully than one expects but sitll a very good brown ale.

Snipes Mountain Coyote Moon;Sunnyside, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Snipes Mountain Microbrewery;Bottle. Poured deep brown with thick tan head. Aroma of malt, caramel and sugar.

Camerons Winter Tipple;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Camerons Brewery (UK);Tasted this in The Esquire House, Glasgow (JDW) in November 2003. Cask, handpump dispense. Ruby black in colour with a thick creamy white head. Strong roast grain notes in the lingering aroma. Creamy texture to the smooth mouthfeel and good lacing throughout. Dark malt complex gives a maltloaf base with dark berry fruit and bitter chocolate. Hint of fresh hop flowers in the short bitter aftertaste but this fades quickly as fruity dessicated raisins rally to the finish. A really good session old ale in style and worth seeking out.
Camerons Winter Tipple;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Camerons Brewery (UK);Cask Handpump at the Penny Black, Northwich (JDW) 30/12/2003 Dark and rich on the palate. Some sour fruit flavour and sweetness. Roast bitter finish.
Camerons Winter Tipple;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Camerons Brewery (UK);Cask Fresh @ JDW's The Full House, Hemel Hempstead. A former cinema. Wonderous deepest glowing ruby with an attractive frothy head. Chocolate, coffee and vanilla flavours. Sweetness and bitterness well balanced - finishing with an initial sweet fruit kick followed by a lingering roasty bitterness. A splendid drop - quality flavours throughout. [3.9] And again... Cask Fresh @ JDW's Sir julian Huxley, Surrey. A former supermarket. Only a week since I had this in Hemel, but I'd forgotten I had it! A dark beer. Though there are dark malt flavours these are quite light - a touch of plum in the middle and some chocolate in the finish. The finish is the darkest part of this brew - the front is light with a gentle touch of fruit. This is almost like a standard bitter with some dark malt thrown in for colour and a deeper flavour. Nice.
Camerons Winter Tipple;Hartlepool, Durham, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Camerons Brewery (UK);Draught, at the Cittie of York,e, London. Thin, anaemic looking, golden body with no head. Spot the difference between this and the regular Ayingerberau. This one is just for those that want to get pissed marginally quicker.
Adnams Old Ale;Southwold, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Adnams;Cask at Waterloo Tap. Vague caramel and veg aroma. Dark cola brown. Frothy beige head. Light sweet. Some low key bitterness on the periphery. Malty chocolate and fruit. Light-medium bodied. Slick. Average carbonation. Long finish. Nice enough if a couple of pints could get sickly.
Adnams Old Ale;Southwold, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Adnams;Cask at The Moon Under Water (JDW), Watford in 2013. Brown colour with an offwhite head. Aroma of brown sugar, toffee and banana. Flavour is super malt heavy, fairly sweet, but not saccharine.

Adnams Old Ale;Southwold, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Adnams;Half pint, cask ale at Piccadilly Tap. Shared with Finn. Stable off-white head to a coal black body. Spotty lacing down the glass. Malty nose, a bit creamy and mid-sweet. Mild caramel malts to the taste character, hints of bread. Mid-sweet malty tail. Just alright without greater excitements. (Manchester 05.02.2019).

Adnams Old Ale;Southwold, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Adnams;Cask, at The Wharf. A clear, brown beer with little to none carbonation or head. Dried fruits chocolate and toffee on the nose. There's bready hints in the flavor, with the same toffee, dark dried fruits and chocolate found in the aroma. It's medium bodied and soft, far from effervescent, and with a lasting finish where also some bitterness show up. Decent, boring. 180224
Adnams Old Ale;Southwold, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Adnams;(Cask by gravity at White Horse, Parson's Green, London, 25 Nov 2017) Dark reddish brown colour with brief, beige head.

Aroma is nutty and caramel malt with some berry fruits on the tongue. Taste is medium bitter with light sweetness before and light sourness to finish. Palate is light to medium bodied, texture is oily, carbonation soft to average, finish is meekly sour. I think we need an Old Ale month to promote the style and a discount for the under 30s to make em try it!
Adnams Old Ale;Southwold, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Adnams;Pours a reddish brown colour with a small beige head. Aroma is malty with some vine fruit and an earthy nuttiness. A malty taste, dry in the mouth with a nutty flavour and more dryness in a fruity finish. One pint is enough for me.
Archers Marley's Ghost;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Strong Ale - English;Evan Evans Brewery;Cask conditioned, aged 8 years at The Royal Oak, Wantage. Burnished orange amber with white head. How this cask had survived so long is anyone’s guess, but what a beer, full, fruity, Christmas pudding flavours with all the spices. Rich on the palate, but with still a lingering sweetness to develop further. A real treat, if only Archers had stuck to beers of this quality they would still have been around.
Archers Marley's Ghost;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Strong Ale - English;Evan Evans Brewery;Cask, The Crown Xmas Fest, Nuneaton. Dusty red amber with a slender halo. Peach, dried apricot and sticky sultana aroma. Wood and mazipan presence with good hop bitterness to balance. Husky pale malts, medicinal cherry hints, Peach Soothers. Tropical and stone fruits. Drinkable, lean and good at the strength.
Archers Marley's Ghost;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Strong Ale - English;Evan Evans Brewery;Cask (gravity) @ The National Winter Ales Festival 2008, Manchester, UK. Clear medium to dark yellow / golden color with a small, fizzy, fair lacing, fully diminishing, off-white to white head. Aroma is light to moderate malty, roasted, fruity, light alcohol. Flavor is moderate to light heavy sweet and bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is flat. (170108)
Archers Marley's Ghost;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Strong Ale - English;Evan Evans Brewery;A Mes rate: Gravicask at Manc Winter Fest. Rich dark golden brown with a slight white rim. Aroma of marzipan, angel cake, fruity banana notes (yes Fin) and some really sweet alcohol. Flavour follows on nicely. There is plenty going on here. The banana turns more pineapple and there is a lovely warm alcoholic finish. British beers with this much alcohol can often taste like paint stripper but this is really well done.
Archers Marley's Ghost;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Strong Ale - English;Evan Evans Brewery;[i] Cask at The National Winter Ales Festival, Manchester 18-01-07 [/i] A warm almost orange coloured beer with good clarity. Was quite surprised to see an Archers beer at this strength as more used to seeing a 1001 different versions of something around 4% from them, still back to the beer in question. There was a bloody good depth of flavour to this beer, ok so the alcohol wasn’t always that subtle but there was an awful lot else going on, I found plenty of tasty tangy fruits in there along with a surprising banana element amongst some other tropical stuff, and occasionally too much sweetness nonetheless I rather enjoyed this and would look out for again quite happily.
Archers Marley's Ghost;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Strong Ale - English;Evan Evans Brewery;Handpump at the Turf in Oxford. Pours a deep gold with a lasting white head. Aroma is sweet with a fair amount of spicy hops, earthiness and alcohol. Body is med. with fair CO2. The flavor is rather one-dimensional. Fair amounts of alcohol and earthy hops yet rather flabby. Sweetness becomes a bit cloying after a while. Could use a fair amount more bitterness to balance all the sweetness.
Archers Marley's Ghost;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Strong Ale - English;Evan Evans Brewery;"Cask handpump at the Swan in the Rushes, Loughborough. Dark golden colour with a slim white creamy head, good lacing. Sweet, malty and fruity. Full bodied and surprisingly drinkable; as in, I was surprised at how easily several pints were downed."
Archers Marley's Ghost;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Strong Ale - English;Evan Evans Brewery;Cask conditioned - handpump - OG’s Wellingborough. Darker than pale golden. This is a good strong English Winter beer. Not complex and not a hop monster, but beautiful sweet fruity malts and full bodied strong alcohol. A sipper rather than a guzzler but very enjoyable.
Archers Marley's Ghost;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Strong Ale - English;Evan Evans Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Beer House, Manchester 17/01/2004 Amber golden coloured and hoppy with some alcohol. Very fruity with some dryness and bitterness in the malt finish.
Archers Marley's Ghost;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Strong Ale - English;Evan Evans Brewery;Gravity cask @ Hants Bowman Dundridge. In some respects much like an average bitter. But as I drank sweet almondy alcohol aromas begin to unfold. A delicious and drinkable stong ale that creeps up on you.
Duckstein Classic Pils;Perth, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Duckstein Brewery;Tasted 1/4/2016. Draught at Duckstein, Henley Brook. Poured a clear pale golden amber with a thin white foamy head that diminished slowly and laced poorly. Carbonation low with medium sized bubbles that gave a slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Aroma subtly of grain and a hint of hops. Taste subtly of malt followed by a very subtle hops bitterness. Light body. Crisp, clean and refreshing with a very slight bitterness on the finish. OK.
Duckstein Classic Pils;Perth, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Duckstein Brewery;Vom Hahn im Sarotti-Kaffee getrunken. Sieht im Glas wie ein ordentliches Pils aus. Wer nicht gerade Fan von Industriebieren ist, sollte es besser nicht trinken.
Duckstein Classic Pils;Perth, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Duckstein Brewery;On tap down in Dusborough. Not bad but not great. Just an easy going, quaffable pilsner without too much going on. Inoffensive
Duckstein Classic Pils;Perth, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Duckstein Brewery;Tasted at a tapas bar in Aachen, Germany, on tap. Light, clear straw-yellow colored with a thin white head that settles quickly. Straightforward malt aroma. Odd, off-putting flavor of metal and mold. Not sure if this batch traveled well. Thin bodied. This one does not live up to the style, not complex, off-flavors.
Duckstein Classic Pils;Perth, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Duckstein Brewery;Sampler tray at their new location in Margaret River region. Slightly hazy lemon yellow with a clingy white whispy head. Floral perfumey hop aroma, clean pale malts with a lovely floral hop accent, lemony tart biter finish. Very nice.
Duckstein Classic Pils;Perth, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Duckstein Brewery;Tasted on Draught at the brewery/restaurant. Woo, reading Ol_Juntan’s review I hope they have improved the recipe, or my judgement must be poor!! The Pils’ I tasted over the weekend was a decent hop driven quencher, that had a very clean palate and didn’t share the other beers general woody/nutty flavours. Pours a crystal clear pale straw with a short dense, soapy white head. Leafy and grassy, bitter hop nose, with only a hint of grain. Hops follow into the mouth with a generous bittering bite. Grassy sides and a little malt and sweet honey upfront, low lemon notes and husky grains mid palate. Quite clean throughout, with reasonable balance, light bodied and crisply refreshing. This was the last beer I tasted for the day and it turned out to be the best. Quite nice!!
Duckstein Classic Pils;Perth, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Duckstein Brewery;Hoppy brew!!! Pleasantly smooth compared to most German beers I have had. $3.00 Canadian for a pint. Not bad! Cheers, HW
Duckstein Classic Pils;Perth, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Duckstein Brewery;This is the first one of these I tried on tap at brewery: PGC with a medium small shortish lasting white head. Medium woody grassy floral hop aroma with disappointing hint of corny adjuncts! Medium thin body. Flavour is medium intenisty classic sharp hoppy bitter - with a very faint hint of a chemical adjunct. It certainly tastes much better than the aroma. Finish is dry but on the stalish side of the bitter. Larger than life size animated Chuckee-Cheese Ompah puppets and speaker playing loudly in my ear does not impress. At least they turned down the music when we asked them and the German Style Biergarten food was very good!
Duckstein Classic Pils;Perth, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Duckstein Brewery;Pale golden colour with an initial pleasant hoppy bite. Short head with a slightly oily taste at mid palate with some sweetness coming through late. Enjoyed this one the most out of the three I tried in this little microbrewery/restaurant.
Duckstein Kristall Weizen;Perth, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Duckstein Brewery;Golden colour with a short lasting head. Banana aroma follows through to the taste followed by slightly oily texture. Not a full flavoured beer but pleasant one for a summer's day in the swan valley.
Golden Valley Dundee Porter;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Porter;Golden Valley Brewery;It’s a by-the-books Porter with not enough alcohol in. Boost it up and I’ll drink another.
Golden Valley Dundee Porter;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Porter;Golden Valley Brewery;Black pour light white taupe Head. Nose is lack luster. Taste is pretty thin, and sadly not the bbest st porter.
Golden Valley Dundee Porter;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Porter;Golden Valley Brewery;Keg @ Golden Valley. Deep brown pour with red highlights. Small khaki head. Aroma of milk chocolate and roasted grain. Flavor skews sweet. Chocolate syrup. Just a touch nutty. Bitter, earthy finish. Smooth and easy drinking. Nothing flashy, but this is totally solid.
Golden Valley Dundee Porter;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Porter;Golden Valley Brewery;On tap at golden Valley brewing. Pours out a dark brown with some amber highlights topped with a small tan head. Nose is light roast malts some coffee and a touch of sweetness. Taste is more of the light roast malts some coffee and milk chocolate sweetness.
Golden Valley Dundee Porter;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Porter;Golden Valley Brewery;On tap at Golden Valley, pours a deep dark mahogany with a small beige head. Aroma has notes of oats, light powdery cocoa, and toasted bread. Flavour is along the same lines, with dry cocoa and oats. Not a robust porter in my books, but it’s clean. Decent but weak.
Golden Valley Dundee Porter;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Porter;Golden Valley Brewery;Draft - Roast and lots of toasty notes. Deep brown with a light brown head. Lots of nice toasty notes, some chocolate and bitterness. Solid.
Golden Valley Dundee Porter;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Porter;Golden Valley Brewery;Bottle 1 pt 6 fl oz on June 27, 2015. From a FredMeyers in Portland, Oregon. Dark brown to black color, teal head. Sweet, ash scent. Light roasted taste, also ash. Light roasted aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel, medium low bitterness.
Golden Valley Dundee Porter;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Porter;Golden Valley Brewery;Keg at the Beaverton brewpub, 11/11/14. Dark mahogany brown with a decent tan covering. Nose is light roast, hint of coffee, cocoa rub, dark malts, toffee. Taste comprises rich roast, light coffee, chocolate, sweet licks. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close. Ok porter.

Golden Valley Dundee Porter;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Porter;Golden Valley Brewery;On tap at the Beaverton location. Pours a deep black color with a medium tan head. A nice nose of cocoa and earthy malt. The flavor is sweet cocoa, chocolates, some light metallic bite.
Duckstein Murphys Stout;Perth, Australia;Stout;Duckstein Brewery;Black in colour with a good size light brown head that didn't last too long. Straightforward light coffee aromas, good lacing and some sweet flavours and also some chocolate.
Seabright Mt. Walker Winter Warmer;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Seabright Brewery;Pours a hazy golden hue with a halo of an off-white head. Nice lacing. Aromas of hops, brown sugar, and very floral. Medium bodied with foral flavors, with a sweetness of honey and even a little oatmeal.
Seabright Mt. Walker Winter Warmer;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Seabright Brewery;12/4/04. On draft at Pizza Port Strong Ale Fest ’04 in Carlsbad, CA 12/4/04. Poured a hazy tan with a thin, off-white head. Decent, low and sticky lacing. Lightly sweet hops and a bit of a golden orange, yeasty glow. What else? No really, what else?? Medium body with some sweetness in there, but not much going on. Bite of alcohol and sort of a dry prick on the finish, but still really not that impressive. Very little character beyond the orange yeastiness and the alcohol. I tried to like this beer, and I’m usually a whore for the big beers with big flavor, but I found very little of interest in this one. Not offensive in taste or touch, but sort of offensive to my beer sensibilities that it can contain so much and offer so little.
Seabright Mt. Walker Winter Warmer;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Seabright Brewery;(Draft: 2004 Strong Ale Festival, Pizza Port in Carlsbad, CA. Day 2, Beer 2) Malty flavor, fairly sweet, moderately fruity, and good hops bitterness for nice balance. The bitterness is pretty strong in the finish for a winter warmer though. Medium body with average viscosity. Sweet, malty nose for sure, and that’s about it in terms of aromas. Medium golden color, cloudy in appearance. Off-white head is smallish on the pour and fades to a sheen.
Seabright Mt. Walker Winter Warmer;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Seabright Brewery;light golden orange with a halo atop..somewhat aged malt aroma with a bit of orange...thick, sweet orange flavors, somewhat dry..Very refreshing and hoppy to be called a winter warmer...A good double IPA though i think.,
Seabright Mt. Walker Winter Warmer;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Seabright Brewery;Light orange color. Small head. Aroma is orange, fruity and sweet. A medium bodied strong ale. Malts are sweet and orangey. Hops are slightly spicy. Nice winter beer, highlighted flavors are orange, vanilla, allspice and nutmeg. I’m just guessing on the spices, I can never figure out what they put in winter beers. Very smooth. Nicely balanced. Hides the 11.7% alcohol very well. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Great Waters Hooligan IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;"I was a bit puzzled by this brew, as it was first presented to me, for as the cascase rippled it appeared to be cast in a a hazy golden hue, not how I prefer to see an IPA. When it settled, the color seemed a surer bronze, and the top was blessed with a milky froth. Aroma: mild, yielding rather little, initially, faint peach, perhaps. Coulda used more in this department. Taste: hops are rather quiet on the palate, but tasty. Bitterness unfolds, and soon a certain sourness appears from time to time, if I’m not going crazy. Under the hops, it’s smooth and creamy. Nicely drinkable, with fruitiness subsisting throught, and I find myself liking it more as I drink. Had in the company of fellow BAs before Winterfest ’04, and we all agreed it was a nice English-style rendition, but still not the sort of IPA that gets me excited. There’s a tagline under it’s name on the board that reads: ""Release your inner wanker."" Man, you really don’t want to encourage me to that, guys, I can’t be held responsible for the after-math!"
Great Waters Hooligan IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;"Cask sample. Quite smoky, fruity and bitter all at once; apple-cherry-nose, unfiltered cloudy honey-color...fruit and sweetness till the dry, oaky finish. Very nice."
Great Waters Hooligan IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Cask. Cloudy golden color with a fairly tall, but bubbly head. Great citrus aroma and taste with some hops, but not overly abundant. Very much a thirst quencher and a session beer.
Great Waters Hooligan IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Sampled at 2004 St. Paul Winterfest. Cask Version. Cloudy amber in color. Dishwater soap head, mostly dissipating. Sweet, faintly hoppy aroma with fruity peach notes. A little off in the aroma. Tastes somewhat amateurish.
Great Waters Hooligan IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Great fruit aroma. Light brown. Lightly hopped. Served on cask at room temp, just a little bit too warm. Some fruit and lots of hops in the aroma.
Great Waters Hooligan IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;On cask: Nice dark golden orangy yellow color, somewhat hazy, lighter corn-like hue at the edges, tall one inch head of fluffy thick off-whiteness that just sits there, barely moving throughout the whole sitting, lacing in ocean foamed thickness and sticking in unusual flame-like shapes. Smell has a nice mild citrusy hop aroma thats seemingly mellow but present with some grassy notes and light breadish malting in the back. Taste is mildly hoppy with citrus and fresh grass, thats light and calm with a nice feel of bitterness, an English Style IPA all the way, thats more like an American pale but calmer. Super smooth with a little toasted breadish malt backing, but the hops perform a nice trick of easy bitterness and smoothness lending mellow citrus and grassyness. Not a major hop monster in any regards but with enough flavor, character, and bittering that makes you keep going. A super clear and lightly fluffy textured feel that fits right in for a cask-conditioned English IPA. Very quaffable stuff. A lighter side of an IPA thats rarely seen these days and pulled off so well. This ones a keeper in my book and could have continued drinking this all night long no prob.
Great Waters Pain in the Abbey Belgian Dubbel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Great Waters Brewing;"Pour is a reddish tinted cola color, very nice looking in the glass. About a 1"" or 1.5"" deep tan head. The head did not stick around for long, and left minimal traces of lace. Big sniff - unfortunately not what I was hoping for. I caught a very faint whiff of something rather unpleasant, something like a burnt rubber odor. It was only on the very first sniff, I could not detect it on subsequent sniffs, even when I poured a second glass. Further sniffs provide only very faint malt and some alcohol. Not very Belgian. The taste is only OK at first, a bit underwhelming, though. Alcohol is prevalent, with a little bit of roastiness. No candi sweetness, no sweet maltiness, no hops at all (the last comment isn’t a knock). No yeastiness (that is a knock). After it warmed up a bit more, there was a hint of black tea, and a little bit of raisin. I would have liked these to be bolder. The mouthfeel was thinner and more alcoholic than I wanted, and also very light on the carbonation."
Great Waters Pain in the Abbey Belgian Dubbel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Great Waters Brewing;Caveat, before we begin: cleverness is good and all, but I have a hard time with the naming of this beer. Apparently, there were problems in the brewing process, and it was a pain in the a--, ah, ha, ha! But I’ll say it now, and I’ll say it again. Why name a something that should be thoroughly pleasant, beer, after something totally un-, i.e., pain? But, the beer. Appearance, a bright garnet hue, with little head. Well, I saw some on others, but it left my glass before it got to me. Aroma: full of fruit, cherries, and berries, vinous and sweet. Taste: sharp and alcoholic, and full of sweetness, fruit aplenty. Very full in body, tasty finish, almost barleywine-like. Wish I knew the ABV here, for I could feel it sneaking up to me. Major flaw, though, was a lack of complexity, missing were earthier, darker, chocolate-y flavors that I enjoy in my favorite dubbels, if that’s really what they were trying to do. I liked it okay, but it didn’t thrill me much. Nice try. [ edit your review ]
Great Waters Pain in the Abbey Belgian Dubbel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Great Waters Brewing;Had this one on cask at Great Waters on 2/13/2004 (I assume this is the same as the Pain in the Abbey, which was also offered as a pushed beer). Not very Belgian in my opinion, but it was a cask ale served in a snifter with a nice head. The aroma was too hoppy for a Dubbel, and the flavor too. The body was a bit watery. I felt that it lacked much of the Belgian yeastiness. Overall, it was OK.
Great Waters Pain in the Abbey Belgian Dubbel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Great Waters Brewing;Aroma of malt. red brown. no head, but there was a lace on the glass. Malt and alcohol in the aroma. A good attempt.
Great Waters Pain in the Abbey Belgian Dubbel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Great Waters Brewing;On-tap:Served way too cold and in a small 10oz heavy tulip glass - Plummy reddish tone in color with a gem like glow, fluffy thick tan head about a finger high leaves lot of thin sheets of lace after subsiding to a slight haze after a while. Smell is light but complex of malty sweetness with some raisin, plum and starfruit, has a touch of hops and yeasty spicyness thats a bit like pepper, but hints more towards cinnamon or paprika. As it warms it picks up small phenolic notes. Taste has a nice start upfront of sweetly rendered malts lending dark fruityness of raisin, plum, and starfruit, but that is short lived as it falls thin quite quickly with the midway hitting some yeasty spices and very light hops then drys a bit in the finsih with some very light spice and cocoa maybe. Feel is a bit bland for a dubble, has a nice start will a solid carbonation and slight fullness, but as it is now it falls flat very quickly ending with an empty palate and mouth. It may need a bit more maturation as we discussed while drinking many of them, so its drinkability was good, but its character in flavor length and body needs some work.
Buffalo Bills Orange Blossom Cream Ale;Hayward, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Buffalo Bills Brewery;"Interesting beer. It actually does taste like orange cream soda...or an orange shandy. Seen this around and wanted to try, but not something I would do regularly. Decent for the summer season. Pale-ish yellow to light orange appearance. Aroma has some orange peel to it. Lots of citrus in the flavor...the balance is right for the style. Wondering how they get the ""cream"" in to this one?"
Buffalo Bills Orange Blossom Cream Ale;Hayward, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Buffalo Bills Brewery;DATE: July 20, 2017... OCCASION: orange cream ale showdown, after sampling Czig Meister’s own take... GLASSWARE: Howard’s Pub pint... pours a pale gold body with active, steady bubbles that build a snow-white creaminess that drifts... sharp, pitched orange citrus, almost to an astringent quality... tough to detect other scents, besides ginger, honey, and apple... fizzy, mellow, sippable, but with a lingering malt effect... cream soda buzz combines with a zesty orange peel to dominate the profile... slightly sour, with strong orange and clementine, this is some dish water with a vibrant finish.... this just doesn’t present as a beer, so I feel it difficult to rate this much higher than the parts themselves...
Buffalo Bills Orange Blossom Cream Ale;Hayward, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Buffalo Bills Brewery;Pours the color of apple juice with strong aromas of marmalade. Immediate hit of oranges on the tongue - too much. Somewhat dry finish.
Buffalo Bills Orange Blossom Cream Ale;Hayward, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Buffalo Bills Brewery;Bottle from World Market in Redwood City, CA. Aroma is Bath & Body Works soap, Orange Blossoms, scented candles, some honey. Taste is vanilla, floral, vanilla floral lotion. To be completely fair, I knew I would hate this beer from the get-go (not a fan of Orange Blossoms or Cream Ales) but this was worse than I expected. Hopefully better suited for freshening the scent of my kitchen sink drain.
Buffalo Bills Orange Blossom Cream Ale;Hayward, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Buffalo Bills Brewery;12oz bottle poured into a Flute at 42°. Color is a light hazy gold with light carbonation and a thin head. Aroma is great smells like a orange cream sickles. It has a light body with a smooth mouth feel. Flavor is orange with a mild sweetness then just a hint of hop spice and just enough bitterness to counter the sweet. After taste is dry with flavors of the aroma hanging on. Overall it’s a very tasty brew, I think they really hit what they were going for.
Buffalo Bills Orange Blossom Cream Ale;Hayward, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Buffalo Bills Brewery;Old rating. Bottle from Old Town. Sickeningly sweet orange aroma that reeks of medicine and over the top florals. Thin and watery mouthfeel. Light to medium body. Not really very creamy. Not a very well-balanced beer.
Buffalo Bills Orange Blossom Cream Ale;Hayward, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Buffalo Bills Brewery;Interesting tidbit to start, the bottle was threaded but the cap was not...interesting. Here’s the rest. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance looked fine. Hazy burnt orange color with a big foamy white and bubbly head. Once it dissipated, there’s no lacing. The smell had the orange and some off-soapy / wants-to-be cream-colored aroma. The taste was sweet through the orange. Soapiness becomes stronger and makes the beer harder to put down. Soapy aftertaste with no finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a good sessionability about it. The carbonation seemed appropriately styled and it didn’t seem bad to me. Overall, the palate was the best thing about it but normally I don’t go after beers just how they feel on the palate, so I will most likely not have this again.
Buffalo Bills Orange Blossom Cream Ale;Hayward, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Buffalo Bills Brewery;Pours yellow with very small white head that dissolved instantly. Fruit, floral and grain aroma. Cream, orange, floral, honey and diacetyl flavors. Light body and moderate carbonation. Floral finish.
Buffalo Bills Orange Blossom Cream Ale;Hayward, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Buffalo Bills Brewery;Poured from a bottle. Short lived bubbly head, sadly no lacing. Aroma is orange all right, but the lack of creaminess (as expected with no lacing) made this a disappointment. Medicinal taste, more like syrup than creamsickle.
Buffalo Bills Orange Blossom Cream Ale;Hayward, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Buffalo Bills Brewery;"""i like the honey ok, otherwise this is just another thin, boring beer. heavy on the flavoring, low on the complexity. not exciting at all, but not much was expected."""
Jacobins Framboise Max;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is a pink color with a large pink tinged head. sweet before the finish. The aroma is a very sweet fruit base. The taste mirrors the aroma and has a slight beer flavor in the finish. A thoroughly enjoyable lambic.
Jacobins Framboise Max;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);It’s alright. A lambic so what do you expect. It kind of tastes like a carbonated raspberry wine. With almost no alcohol.
Jacobins Framboise Max;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Bottle (best before aug 2014) @ home. Purple colour with no head. Smells raspberry, fruity, nice. Tastes sourish, raspberry, fruity, pretty nice. Medium body, soft to medium carbo. I can drink this. Doesn’t taste old, maybe it got even better.
Jacobins Framboise Max;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);250ml bottle. Pours dark pink with an off-white head. Sweet raspberry jam flavour. Taste is sour raspberries. Simple but enjoyable.
Jacobins Framboise Max;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);33 cl bottle. 3.5% alv. Ruby pour. Smell is sugary tart raspberry. Flavor is tart and sweet, candied raspberry flavor, not too much of a sweetener note. Was expecting suck-age but its not terrible.
Jacobins Framboise Max;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Een complexloos goed frambozenbiertje voor te drinken op hete zomerdagen. Lekker verfrissend
Jacobins Framboise Max;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);This fruit beer has a sweet and sour taste of raspberries with a clear raspberry aroma
Jacobins Framboise Max;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Hard to rate.. It's a contrived, commercial, sweet raspberry treat. Huge nose of sweet raspberries... Followed by a big, sweet, tart mouthful of raspberries on the palate. Candied, tart raspberries just about defines everything about this beer pop. Hard to not like, though hard to take seriously as well. It's just fun, fruity and delicious. --- tasted while on a long journey to understand the world around me...
Jacobins Framboise Max;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Bottle. Red colour with a pink head. Sweet raspberry aroma. Flavour is very fruity. More like an alcopop than a beer. Quite good as an alcohol juice.
Jacobins Framboise Max;Bellegem, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Omer Vander Ghinste (Bockor);Raspberry nose. Pale pink head fast disappearing. Clear ruby color. Sourish raspberry taste. Nice.

Melchers Rembrandt Masterpiece Beer;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Can from Stewarts Cellars August 2013. Pale and thin looking in the glass and flavour was very much non existent with some wet straw and grain coming through.

Melchers Rembrandt Masterpiece Beer;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Pours a pale golden color. Very unenjoyable taste with a metallic aftertaste.
Melchers Rembrandt Masterpiece Beer;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);(Bottle). Miserable beer with metallic taste. Thin watery flavor of grainy malt and grassy hops.
Melchers Rembrandt Masterpiece Beer;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Masterpiece. A misnomer if ever there was one. Mind you, calling it Melcher’s Rubbish Dutch Lager may not be the best USP in terms of marketing but it does have the added bonus of representing the Dutch habit of being forthright at the expense of being likeable. So anyway, clear, gold and sparkling in the glass with a persistent fluffy white head. It is good looking even if it isn’t good smelling. Aromas of grain and standard Eurolager that is evocative of the future flavour when it comes back up along with plastic pizza and too many other pints of fizzy Eurolager. The flavour is clean if a little pasticky. I have had better pints and worse ones, but this sits in the lower end of taste. Fortunately my expectations weren’t too high.
Melchers Rembrandt Masterpiece Beer;Leuven, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);"Medium gold and bright with a towering two inches of foam that raises up and out the glass and holds on well. Aroma of next day boiled eggs, fermented cabbage, dried mown grass, haybales and sawdust. Flat, flaccid, soapy and slick in mouthfeel. Light in body but with all that going on it was hard to swallow. Mint and lemon zest underneath; wishy washy malt and corn-like adjuncts perplex the mid-palate. Just wrong in the finish, acrid and chemical with nothing going for it positively. I couldn’t finish this, but geez it looked good in the glass. (50cL, Labelled Melcher’s Dutch Gold Lager Beer, BB 16/09/13, The Beer Store Morley)"
Ironbark Aussie Pils;Caversham, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ironbark Brewery;Very ordinary offering. This is not a good advert for craft beer. Did not help that it was served in plastic! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Ironbark Aussie Pils;Caversham, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ironbark Brewery;Unusual sweet fruit aroma followed by stale malt. Overprimed froathy head with murky yellow colour. Fruit sour flavour with malt and hops. Flat palate.
Ironbark Aussie Pils;Caversham, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ironbark Brewery;Sampled at the brewery. Pale blonde, white cap. Biscuity pale malts, clean and grainy, medium bitter hop finish. Decent.
Ironbark Aussie Pils;Caversham, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ironbark Brewery;Re-rate: Graeme has finally struck gold. The head brewer of Ironbark’s unsure of his new ’squeaky-clean’ dry Pilsner, yet I could easily say this doesn’t come better. I was on Brown’s when my wife got me to sniff a glass of this over an America Wheat they also brew. Thinking she got me I commented on this ones fresh cracked pepper tickle, a herbal side, a dry, typically ’Pilsner-malt’ powderiness and subtle fresh kilned grain character. The Wheat beer didn’t fair so well, but to my now interested colleagues I had to down my wife’s Pilsner and give comment. It tasted great. Clean, no soap, no starch, no dank liquor or broth of cooked vegetables. Just dry, grainy malts, a light sourness in back where the malt and hops integrate ensuing some very well defined Zatec hop notes that add that peculiar but much appreciated spicy, vine clipping edge. It peaks, it drops off, it does all sorts of lovely stuff. It is a friend of my wifes. It is a beer that has too many ’it’s’. Great Summer sessions to come. Cheers!! Finally got down to taste this one only to find my hangover from the long weekend and the inescapable heat of Labour day took the joy out of the occasion. On draught and into a frosty schooner. Bright medium gold body with a persisting half inch head of foam that managed a little legs. Couldn’t pick up much aroma as I think my brain had stopped receiving signals. Lemon rind and a light bite of grassy hops maybe, late into drinking. In the mouth it felt as good as chilled water after a sting in the desert. Light in body and a little soapy in feel but the finish was crisp and showing some tight grassy and spicy hops with a little bitterness to quench the thirst. Malt seems a little untidy with some pasty, buttery flavours but it doesn’t harm it that much as it crossed the tongue in record speed, and had I felt a little better it may have been replaced by several more schooners full. A good thirst quencher, or even a great start for a day of tastings as the brewery/restaurant now looks a treat! 4,4,6,2,12
Ironbark Aussie Pils;Caversham, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ironbark Brewery;The third stop in the bluevegie welcome to WA journey. Luckily these beers are the small 7oz one that are throwdowns at $2 a pop. Both for the reasons that we were at the end of the enjoyment and evaluation spectrum and that this was the, ah, least best of the three breweries. I sensed a bit of disorganisation here and not a great understanding of what was on offer. There is a clear extract character here and not a lot of hops to jump around about. They need some direction here or it could be a retired brewery one day in the future.
Ironbark Aussie Pils;Caversham, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ironbark Brewery;Nice soft texture but no real hop bite, medium pale gold colour short head and no lacing. Inoffensive beer.

Ironbark Ironbock;Caversham, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ironbark Brewery;Visited the brewery in the Swan Valley, did a few tastings, then left with a carton of their mixed offerings. Overall, a very worthwhile venture! A range of styles that are mostly quite well done, and at least worth a taste. This ironbock was probably my favourite. It pours a slightly hazy orange amber with a small but lasting tan head. Rich caramel aroma with some definite apricots in there too. The palate is well rounded with genttle fruit notes complimenting the toasty malt. A very nice beer.
Ironbark Ironbock;Caversham, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ironbark Brewery;Yeah great name. A real blokes beer for the blokes that don’t want no sheila’s beer. Looks good as do a lot of the beers of this style but a cloying sweetness in the nose and extract tang on first taste. Damn and bugger. By this time the tastebuds were somewhat shot but there was enough here to unimpress. Again, sincere thanks to Gary and Jenny for a great day.
Ironbark Ironbock;Caversham, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ironbark Brewery;Complete re-rate on this one as the beer has changed and vastly improved over the years. On draught at the brewhouse, and cloned exactly from the bottle. Pours a deep chestnut brown, slight haze to it and very lightly carbonated. Head formed quite firmly, a dull beige, rocky and frothy, and drabbed fine lacework down the glass. Aroma has savoury fruit, wood and sticky toffee. Biscuity sweet upfront in the mouth. Woody and lightly nutty as it moves along showcasing some complex darker malts belying it’s modest ABV. Finish has a savoury fruit edge, nice malted roundness and just a puff of smoke that lingers in the mouth. Nice depth, light in body and extremely sessionable. Picked up Silver in its division at the AIBA, a fact I found out after re-rating it. This was a plain good, solid, well made quaffer. Very nice indeed.
Ironbark Ironbock;Caversham, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Ironbark Brewery;Tawny brown colour with a short but lasting head. Very malty-almost chocolately in taste but not much else.
Ironbark Federation Wheat;Caversham, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Ironbark Brewery;One of Ironbark’s original offerings, and oddly one I haven’t tried (having lived within walking distance for a few years). Tasted from the bottle and poured into a weissbier glass. Clear medium gold body with a lot of carbonation raising up to a big fluffy head that grew a good inch out the rim. The head remained for the length and left legs of bubbles down the glass. Grainy, sour-dough and wheat nose with a hint of tangy lemon. Quite spritzy in the mouth, light bodied and generally doughy in mouth-feel. Strong wheat grain flavours, tangy and sweet, with no real wheat beer esters or phenols, it almost tasted like a wheat biscuit. Finished quite crisp despite it’s unusual flavour and feel in the mouth. Overall, it wasn’t too bad a drop, unique, but easily quaffable. (33cL, 4.2% ABV)
Ironbark Federation Wheat;Caversham, Australia;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Ironbark Brewery;Pale yellow hue with a lasting small head. Taste of cloves and coriander that finishes dry crisp and lightly hopped.
Ironbark Munich Lager;Caversham, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ironbark Brewery;"Visited the brewery in the Swan Valley, did a few tastings, then left with a carton of their mixed offerings. Overall, a very worthwhile venture! A range of styles that are mostly quite well done, and at least worth a taste. This is more of what I have come to expect from a lager (compared to the surprising Rousies Red). Golden amber with a foamy head that laces its way to the bottom. All malt aroma (nothing soapy or metallic here-- very nice) and a full malty palate as well. Well balanced and delicious. This is what the majority of macro-brewed ""Premium"" lagers should be striving for."
Ironbark Munich Lager;Caversham, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ironbark Brewery;Tasted on Draught and in the bottle. This one, personally, is the best beer available from this small brewery. Pours a slightly hazy light amber with a lasting fluffy white head that left rings down the glass. Aroma and taste are malt driven and hint at citric fruits. The palate is dominated by sweet and lightly toasted malt, dry chaffey grains and a light grapefruit zest that balances it all out. Finishes of with a short dry malty swallow. This beer is a great Summer thirst quencher, making for a pleasant change from the Macro-brewed lagers.
Ironbark Munich Lager;Caversham, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ironbark Brewery;Burnt amber colour with a short head. Most of the taste is at the front of the palate(malty) nothing in the middle then if you are looking for it you can find the peppery aftertaste.

Gale's Robins Revenge;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;NOt really exciting, although I thought it was from the same brewery, Robinsons. Perhaps this is the last beer I have from GAles, since it may be disappearing. A little bitter. BUt just good.
Gale's Robins Revenge;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;I love finding old notes. Had this at the Green Man last December and found it to be another typical ale of its kind, meaning that the palate was getting a bit jaded by this point. Nevertheless it is a good coppery colour and reasonable ead from the cask. Fruity nose and equally fruity flavour on the palate and good hop presence.
Gale's Robins Revenge;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;Jan, 2005 Britannia, Chatham. A malty red ale with some damp autumn leaves and a roasty bitterness at the back. Vague chocolate notes. Flavoursome Celtic Ale, but doesn’t quite pull it off in the finish. [2.9] Dec, 2005JDW, Leytonstone.

Gale's Robins Revenge;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;Cask conditioned - handpump - Eykyn Arms Gayton Northants. Unfortunately served with an inappropriate sparkler. A mid brown beer with a ruby hue and a creamy head which I ket pass before drinking. The aromas are berries and a little bit of pear (which I think was a result of bad keeping). The taste is quite fruity with strawberries noted. A tasty Wintery beer which would do better in a better establishment.
Gale's Robins Revenge;Horndean, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gales;Cask Conditioned at The Blinking Owl, North Newington, Oxon. Chestnut coloured with white frothy head.

Short hoppy finish. 2.7 Re Rate at The Woolpack, Banbury Much better this time, flavours that carry more than the beers low ABV, richly malted and fruity. Just go’s to show, its often where you drink the beer

La Mare au Diable Rousse des Cantons;Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;La Mare au Diable;In short: Messy fruity-cereal mix. Part ok, part bad, but not boring. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Cloudy copper body with a medium beige head In long: Lots of toasted cereals without much the caramelised part of it. A little roasted three bark in the malts. The out-of-left-field fruity yeast is distracting my palate away. Brewed with hops saving mode in full effect. An overall impression of Kellogg’s Raisin Bran. Not sure what to make of it, kind of feels like a Belgian-Irish cross that got the worst of both words. How can a place keep doing business serving beers like that? Oh wait, the pub was totally empty on a Saturday night. Justice!

Malty flavor as well, but with the same fruity and slightly metallic touch found in the aroma. Caramel and bread as well. Medium body, and a fruity finish with bread, toffee amd a metallic note in the background. There isn’t anything wrong with this one, except it’s boring. It is quite weak on aroma and flavor, unoffensive and easy to drink. (080426)
Wessex Craft Brewers Jockstrap;Coleford, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Branded Drinks / Integrated Bottling Solutions;Dark amber with a moderate head. It’s like all the beers from IBS are built in the same boring way with a few small variations. This one has a malty aroma and flavour with weak notes of fruit and a moderate bitter finish.

Slightly rich on the palate. Crisp full malt finish with a hint of bitterness.
Badger Gobbledy Goose;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask Conditioned at The Bell, Banbury. Brown Amber beer with thinnish head. This is a sweetish malty beer, an attempt to deliver a winter warmer which in my opinion misses the mark. Little subtelty of flavours, mainly an alcoholic sweetness. There is a boiled hoppy finish.
Badger Gobbledy Goose;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Nice mid-amber appearance. Very subdued aroma, although the hevay cold I am suffering from might not have helped. I will give it the benefit of the doubt in that respect, otheriwse it would lose a point. Pleasnt malty edge on the palate, but a pronounced bitterness develops and dominates the finish. Slight metallic tang lingers. A Silk Tork says, quite restrained, especially for a winter beer, and consequently, as the brewery suggests, much more quaffable than one might expect. I quite liked this, but nothing exceptional. Obviously doing the Wetherspoons rounds at the moment. Handpump, Lord Moon of the Mall, London SW1, December 2003.
Badger Gobbledy Goose;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask Conditioned, Masque Haut, London.

Badger Gobbledy Goose;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);Cask Fresh @ JDW Golden Lion, Rochester. Dark amber colour - quite murky like a brown ale. A darkly malty beer with dark tangy hops, but all in a restrained manner. Some slight raisin and toffee flavours. Flavours are slightly murky but give an acceptable overall impression. A black tea aroma.

Dorset Steam;Dorchester, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dorset Brewing Co. (dbc Ales);Cask handpull at Crosse Keys, JDW, London. Deep chestnut colour with sparsebeige head. Oddly malty but metallic beer. Malt in mouth is good and bitterness on end, some choc and grainyness. Feels like a dark malt beer, but the mouthfeel feels light whilst the end is grainy/dry with some caramalised red fruit. Genuinely odd.
Dorset Steam;Dorchester, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dorset Brewing Co. (dbc Ales);JDW, Holborn Mmmm. This is a very tasty and fresh malty beer with enough hops to provide interest, balance and a further depth of attraction, leading into a lingering finish. The combination of sweetness and bitterness playing around the fruit is quite delightful. A very enjoyable drop.

Elgoods Fenman Pale Ale;Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Elgoods Brewery;My great-grandfather was a proud Fenman, hailing from the town of March in Cambridgeshire. Brown with a small white head. Taste is malty and grainy, almost like a mild. There’s some bitterness. The beer struggles to deliver its flavour and only just succeeds.
Elgoods Fenman Pale Ale;Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Elgoods Brewery;A light, amber, brown beer with a light, white head. A subtle wheaty nose, with hops and some fruit. The taste is light, with hops and wheat being the main elements, there is a slight maltiness in the finish. The aftertaste is quite long, and slightly dry.

Elgoods Fenman Pale Ale;Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Elgoods Brewery;Don't know if this was a skunky bottle or if it's just bad beer....Not bad looking but skunky metallic aroma with some light caramel thrown in. Thin mouthfeel of mild malts and maybe the caramel again....lingers when you don't want it to. Nice of radiomgb to share this one he got from a friend in England but it disappointed us both.
Elgoods Fenman Pale Ale;Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Elgoods Brewery;Clear copper in colour. Aroma was slightly metallic, some skunkiness, mild fruitness and caramel. Flavour was of very mild caramel, a touch of malt, very thin body and a coating mouthfeel. Finishes with a medium metallic bitterness.
Elgoods Fenman Pale Ale;Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Elgoods Brewery;Bottled, Pasteurised. Light brown with small head. Thin metallic malt beer with little character. Shame as I bought 4 bottles because it was cheap, now I know why.
Ryburn Best Mild;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Mild Ale;Ryburn Brewery;"Cask at Babington Arms (JDW) Mild Festival. Has some of that syrupy fruit flavour present in Luddite; dark with a deep brown tinge, dry palate with a smack of roastiness to it. Above average."
Ryburn Best Mild;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Mild Ale;Ryburn Brewery;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Rugby BF. This very dark if not black beer has a lovely roasty chocolate aroma and an excellent roastiness to the taste too. An excellent beer which packs such flavour for its low ABV
Ryburn Best Mild;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Mild Ale;Ryburn Brewery;Gravity @ The Contemptible Beer Bashing Festival. I don't remember the argument that Spiesy mentions, but I do remember the girl... O, yes - I remember the dark eyed girl! Beer notes: Dry and roasty - tastes like a weak stout or a dry mild. Some vanilla in the nose. Vanishing finish. Acceptable, but not impressive.
Ryburn Best Mild;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Mild Ale;Ryburn Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Battersea Beer Festival, 2004. I’m gone a minute, just a minute, only to return to a debate about this beer. Silk is really starting to fire up. So much so that he has forgotten what a mild tastes like. He’s thinking this beer is stout or some other thing. Chris_o still has things together, whilst I, I’m positively fresh, having only just arrived at the festival. I’m not sure where ST’s head was at this time but this beer is definitely a standard mild. Dark like a regular mild. Deep malt notes like a mild. Thin bodied palate like a mild. Its just a decent mild. This period leads onto a massive debate about who on the site has drunk the most milds. See Golcar - Dark Mild.
Ryburn Best Mild;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Mild Ale;Ryburn Brewery;Very dark and completely opaque. Burnt toffee/treacle on the nose & palate. Quite chewy for a mild. Dryish finish, with some sweetness. Very pleasant. Handpump, The Speaker, London SW1, September 2003.

Poured a clear, clean golden colour with a thin and fading white head. Strange eggy smell at first, then a fruitier ester took over. Citrus hints emerged too. The eggy aroma did the beer no favours and it almost ruined the tasting for me, luckily I soldered on and the beer improved a bit. Hop led brew with not much malt action to talk about.

Soggy caramel, old plum and cardboard aroma, betraying a decent enough macro Alt. Taste is quite fruity, must be on account of that added wheat, instead of alt-dry and woody. Old Raisinbread, flat fruity caramels, a tiny hop edge, with a again a distinct liquorice/Süßholz note in the finish.
Niederrhein Alt;Korschenbroich, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Privatbrauerei Bolten;Clear ruby brown, small light brown foam head. quite some carbonation. Aroma is small caramel, some cereal. Small roasted taste, not too sweet, little herby. (Velp 201411)

Columbus Brewing Santa's Little Helper;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Columbus Brewing Company;If it weren't for the aroma, this beer would have rated much higher. The golden amber color has no head. Overpowering spice hop aroma almost smells skunked. If you can get past that, the light body is clean and refreshing. No bitterness follows the slightly spicy flavor. Some caramel and a warm plum taste. Finishes well.
Columbus Brewing Santa's Little Helper;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Columbus Brewing Company;On draught at the brewpub. Pours a clear light amber color with a thin off-white head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is lightly spiced with a faint hops presence as well. The body is on the light side, and nothing really stands out in the flavor. Some hops, some spice, and some malt but none in enough quantity to make this a really good beer. The finish is short and lightly bitter. I know they can do better than this.

John Harvards Black Mountain Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Aroma reminded me of Guinness. Black body of course. Flavor is more than Guinness though - more coffee and a little more roast in there. Solid stuff. Avoided the watery feeling of Guinness.
John Harvards Black Mountain Stout;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Had this as part of the sampler at the Wayne, Pa location. Didn't like this one that much. Was to bitter for my taste. Did have a slight roasty taste to it.

Rock Bottom King of Prussia Czars Nightmare;King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rock Bottom King of Prussia;Darker brown with a sweet, chocolatey, roasty aroma.

Rock Bottom King of Prussia Czars Nightmare;King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rock Bottom King of Prussia;On tap at the King of Prussia location. Poured a dark black with a creamy lacing tan head, great looking stout. This years version came in at 7.7% and I believe they have a new brewer on hand. Aroma of roasted malts, cocoa, coffee and slight hops. Flavor of roasted malts, chocolate, ligth coffee, nice and smooth with a really nice bitter finish. Would be interested to see how this would hold up to some age. It also seems like some other years were a little higer in the abv. Was on the low end for that this year.
Rock Bottom King of Prussia Czars Nightmare;King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rock Bottom King of Prussia;This is a solid Impy stout. Aroma of roasty malt, with the mandatory chocoff and anise. Tastes chocoffy, with licorice. A tad thin, but good complexity.

Stonefly Imperial Star Destroyer Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stonefly Brewery;On tap at GTMW 2012. Dark brown with a beige crown. Aroma of dark roasted malts, light coffee, chocolate and a bit of sweet malt. Taste is a bit amiss with chocolate, overly roasted malts, acidic coffee and finishes up with a bit of roasted malt bitterness. Doesn’t feel 9.5%.
Stonefly Imperial Star Destroyer Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stonefly Brewery;8/11/12. GTMW. Black pour, maybe a very dark brown, with a small tan head. Light ashy aroma with touches of chocolate, coffee, and a hint of fruitiness. Surprisingly weak, watery flavor for a beer of such style and ABV, but it shows a touch of ash, roasted coffee, and chocolate. Meh.
Stonefly Imperial Star Destroyer Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stonefly Brewery;Decent, fruity as well as roasty. It is probably the est thing this brewpub has to offer.
Stonefly Imperial Star Destroyer Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stonefly Brewery;Pours to a black body with a thin tan head. Oily looking. The aroma is chocolate, burnt wood, creosote, and some vanilla. The flavor has some green apples creeping in that signify flaws and it was really distracting. Some burnt black malts and chocolate too. Average palate for the style. If it wasn’t for the overwhelming green apples, this would probably be good. Not worth $6/glass.
Stonefly Imperial Star Destroyer Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stonefly Brewery;On draught during Great Taste of Midwest 2009 in Madison, Wisconsin. Pours a near opaque dark brown brew with a thick tan head that slowly dissipates. Aroma of roasted dark malt, some coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of burnt wood. Taste is medium to full bodied, smooth texture with flavors of toasted dark malt, some coffee, wood, some flowery hops and a touch of chocolate. Finish is a little gritty with a toasted dark malt and coffee aftertaste. Alcohol is well hidden.
Stonefly Imperial Star Destroyer Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stonefly Brewery;On tap at the Wisconsin Micro-Brewer’s Beer Fest. Poured black with a loose-bubbled tan head. The aroma picked up well-roasted coffee and dark chocolate with hints of molasses and tobacco rolling in later.. somewhat muddled. The flavor found more coffee and lots of black patent malts on the well-roasted core with dry, older oak accents.. deep, but it never really established an identity.. dry finish picked up some smoke. Dry and scratchy on the palate.. medium-plus bodied.. warm enough without being abrasive.. OK feel. I was hoping for a little more out of this one.
Stonefly Imperial Star Destroyer Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stonefly Brewery;Jet black with a taller dense tan head. Sweet roasted malt with hints of peat and English hops. A waft of B.O., wait that is from the pseudo-quasi eatsider that came in with a gyro. Wood and light peat mingle with some sweet roasted malts. A real cross between a traditional English imperial stout and Baltic porter.
Stonefly Imperial Star Destroyer Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stonefly Brewery;Lovely and confident appearance in the goblet, and served at 55 degrees, so we’re off to a good start. Thick and opaque with a dark khaki brown head - possibly the darkest head I’ve ever seen. Deep, dark, slowly cascading lace. Reserved aroma of Mexican coffee and something all too familiar with how a campfire smells the morning after a heavy dew (that burnt twigs and spent charcoal character.) Other faint wafts reveal a smoker’s leather jacket and a little bit of bubblegum. Hit’s the palate and it’s some slippery shit. Roasty, burnt and dry. Bittering is on the underbelly and if I waited around for any other amped malt contributions, I’d die of old age. An unseen rebel nemesis keeps the flavor at bay. Unsalted pretzels shoved in the broiler meet a burnt, sugar-free Oreo pie crust. Syrupy, sliding melodrama. Chocolate torte-like in the sense of imparting an arid feeling after each sip. That, and some singed, generic pecans purchased from Aldi. Dark chocolate, confectionary style, no sweetening. Roastiness flails rapidly to keep this one from going under. Bitter, gritty, dry afterlife.
Stonefly Imperial Star Destroyer Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stonefly Brewery;"Sampled as ""Imperial Star Destroyer Stout"". Black body, thin tan head. Dry roasty aroma with coffee bean highlights and a touch of fruity smoke. Well balanced flavor - dry roast and sweetness (berry and dry chocolate). Lingering tangy berry and dry finish. A well put-together IS. The bartender said it was 10% but it sure doesn’t taste like it."
Stonefly Imperial Star Destroyer Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Stonefly Brewery;WOW, one of the best beers I have had in a long time! There are so many flavors in this beer, yet they go so well together! I taste Chocolate, Coffee, and a fruity taste! Man, what a good beer!
Stonefly Four Wolves English Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Stonefly Brewery;Shaker pint pour at the Brew Pub in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Pour is a light haze orange, with a smallish light tan head. Aroma is sweet malt, some cereal grains. Pretty faint nose.

Stonefly Four Wolves English Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Stonefly Brewery;I recently sampled this brew, and it was might tastey. The newest of Stoneflys beers.

Stonefly Four Wolves English Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Stonefly Brewery;Draught sample at Beer Barons tasting. Cloudy yellow with thin white head. Aroma of grassy and herbal hops and light sweet malt. Taste is of grassy and floral hops, lemon and light sweet malts with and aftertaste of grass. Mild bitterness and a shade bland.

Pours a clear light copper amber brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that dissipates nearly clean. Aroma of caramel malt, some light pear and apple fruitiness with a touch of herbal spices. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with flavors of caramel malt, some toffee and more dry herbal spices. Finish is somewhat dry with a mild herbal aftertaste is lingers after the finish. Interesting and different.
Stonefly Four Wolves English Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Stonefly Brewery;A nice, though not overwhelmingly grand, beer. The nose is somewhat more understated than I would like to encounter, being a bit of caramel and a floral/herbal mix. The taste is butterscotch mingling with floral hops.
Stonefly Four Wolves English Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Stonefly Brewery;"On tap at Stonefly as ""Four Wolves English Ale"". Poured clear bright golden with a slight orange tint… light, creamy white head and thoroughly-coating lacing. The aroma found dry lighter fruits and English toffee.. pleasant and sweet, but weak. In the flavor department, sharp lemon and sour herbal notes take over and leave a tacky, ugly flavor on the finish.. sweet bready notes and toffee at the core, but they’re pushed back. Light-bodied with a creamy middle on the palate.. again the sharpness jumps up at the back, and this doesn’t end well."
Stonefly Four Wolves English Ale;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Stonefly Brewery;I've heard about this bar for a while, but never made wy way there until today. Damn, what was I waiting for! The beer is great, and the music kicks a$$ too. Why haven't more people rated these beers? Maybe because of the location? All I know is the Riverwest area is 2 for 2 in great breweries given to the world (Lakefront also got its start in Riverwest, hence Riverwest Stein).
Koantjes Bier Maldegem;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Proefbrouwerij;Old bottle from De Bierloods. Golden colour, white foam. Nose of citrus, dust, caramel and chemical off flabours. Unbalanced. Too old obviously.
Koantjes Bier Maldegem;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Proefbrouwerij;Commissioned by the Confrérie van Rietje Koane of Maldegem. Dense, moussy, pale yellowish head, orangey amber colour, clean but hazy after adding deposit. So far so good, but then there’s the smell: a strong shampoo-like solvent odour, dominating the otherwise okay aromas of apple, apricot, honey and yeast. Light sweetish taste with medium carbonation, nutty malts, orange peel, quickly turning into a wry, chemically bitter, dryish and utterly unpleasant taste. I do not know what went wrong here but this was clearly a failure.
Koantjes Bier Maldegem;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Proefbrouwerij;Bottled. A golden beer with a thick lasting white head. and good lacing. A sweet candy sugar like aroma with yeasty notes and lemony hops. The taste is the same. Proper Belgian yeast and Saazy floral hop flavours with a bit of pepper. A good Belgian strong.

Koantjes Bier Maldegem;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Proefbrouwerij;The colour was milky. The aroma was dominated by yogurt. The flavour had notes of vegetables to it. It was a rather disgusting brew.

Yeasty aroma with tones of orange, sourness and sweetness. Sweet malty flavour with hints of yeast, ends up light but someway nothing speciel. Sour finish.
Koantjes Bier Maldegem;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Proefbrouwerij;(Bottle 33 cl) Amber golden with floating, stale impurities and a creamy, white head. Fruity, sourish aroma. Malty body with notes of yeast. Seemingly a battle is going on in this beer between the malty sweetness and a weird tartness. Neither seems to win, making this rather unbalanced and flawed. 291205
Dubuisson Scaldis/Bush Prestige;Pipaix, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dubuisson;Piana obfita, ale gruba, szybko opada do chmurki. Barwa bursztynowa z pływającymi drobinkami. W zapachu wyraźne nuty dębiny, świeżego drewna, delikatnej waniliny, do tego oczywiście suszone morele, rodzynki, miód. W smaku dość słodkie, owocowe, głównie susz, miód, wanilina, lekko pikantna przyprawowość, nieduża, migdałowo głogowa goryczka, rozgrzewający, lekko burbonowy finisz. Wysycenie dość wysokie, nieco lepkie, nieco oleiste w odbiorze. Generalnie fajne, fajna beczka, ale brakuje swoistej lekkości białego wina, winogron. Do poziomu genialnego Struise T.H.R.E.E. trochę brakuje.

Dubuisson Scaldis/Bush Prestige;Pipaix, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dubuisson;Très joli travail réalisé ici par la brasserie Dubuisson à partir de la scaldis ambrée qui au passage a gagné 1 % pour atteindre les 13 % Mais si celui-ci est chaleureux et puissant, il en est pour autant très bien intégré sans que les 13 % soient agressifs. Pas de sucrosité trop importante non plus pour un équilibre qui est très bien pensé et réalisé. Côté arômes la refermentation et le passage en fût donne un résultat surprenant quand on connaît la scaldis ambrée mais que je trouve très abouti et qui pourrait s'apparenter en une fusion entre bière belge forte et barley wine. Ainsi au nez ce sont arômes de fruits confits, d'ananas, d'orange, de miel, de vin oxydé, de miel, de cognac et de fut de chêne qui s'expriment avec la force et le caractère de L'alcool et cette tension dans les arômes caractéristique de bières belges fortes. On retrouve ensuite ce cocktail complexe tout au long de la dégustation, et ce dès l'attaque qui présente également un léger poivre et une petite pointe d'acidité (provenant très certainement de la maturation en fut) conférant une petite fraîcheur opportune. En deuxième bouche le poivre se fait un peu plus présent, toujours avec cette base d'une belle complexité et avec un alcool qui prend plus d'ampleur allant crescendo. L'arrière bouche est d'ailleurs davantage tourné vers un alcool aux accents de cognac et donnant du caractère à l'ensemble. Le final, très long donne également la part belle à cet alcool chaleureux. N'oublions pas le visuel avec un ambré légèrement voilé et nappé d'une fine couche de mousse. Une bière qui se déguste lentement et qui se partage.

Il Vicino Irish Red;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Tasted as Canteen Irish Red at GABF 2018 in a sampler glass, it poured a mostly-clear reddish amber with off-white foam and lace. Nice appearance and pretty good malty, nutty aroma, but poor flavour. Mushy, oxidized, lacking any crisp, grainy traits. No stylistic toasty/roasty grain bitterness. Medium body and bland aftertaste. A missed opportunity. Nice looking booth and artwork, too bad the beer wasn't as good as the presentation.
Il Vicino Irish Red;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);"on tap at the brewpub; beautiful red color; nice aroma of caramel malt and hops; a well balanced beer; nice caramel malt background with a good deal of bitter hops; fairly light bodied"
Il Vicino Irish Red;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Tap @ Brewery. Agree with the low scores on this beer. Pours a rusty red with little to no head or lasting lace. Caramel malt comes through on the aroma but in a weak, non-griping way. The palate confirms the lack of grip and finish. Hops are in there but supporting a losing cause. Overall, suggest they dump this beer of change recipes.
Il Vicino Irish Red;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Draft at the source. Hazy ambr color, white head. Aroma of burnt caramel. Taste is similar.

Aroma of light honey, delicate fruitiness, and a very subtle nutty character. Flavor is wheaty, fruity, and moderately sweet like a combination of shredded wheat, Trix, and honey. Also has a lemony note and a light grassy finish. Some mild bitterness lingers just enough to keep the sweetness from becoming cloying, making this an extremely easy drinking beer.

Il Vicino Dark and Lusty Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);On tap at brewery. This is a solid stout, this close to being something special and just falling short. Minimal head sets the tone, normal roast grain aroma and taste, and a texture that’s just shy of velvety. Good, tasty and robust.
Il Vicino Dark and Lusty Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);"Sampled August 2014 A steady pour into my growler produces a dark brown colored head that sits on top of a pitch black beer. The aroma smells of deeply roasted malts, dark cold coffee, burnt whole grain toast, burnt molasses, and as it warms a roasted, concentrated prune like note. Dry, roasted, burnt, and bitter up front, the beer has some decent body to it without being overly heavy, but due to the burnt character it dries out significantly. The beer has a burnt tartness to it that accentuates a roasted plum like fruitiness, or at least a hint of fruitiness. The dark, roasted malt character thoroughly dominates the flavor profile of this beer; chewy, burnt whole grain toast, slightly acrid / bitter charcoal, burnt chocolate This is quite a tasty Stout, though it is a bit simplistically focused on the ample roast character."

Il Vicino Dark and Lusty Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Dark brown. Some haze. Low caramel head. Rich and roasty aroma is straightforward stoutiness, maybe a little bit nutty. Creamy front, with a touch of roast acidity late. Mellow roast, toast and nut character.

Thanks Dave - Pours black with a short tan head that laces a little on the way down. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, some nuts, and a little bit of vanilla. Flavor is quite roasty. Chocolate malts, some nut flavor, coffee, a little molasses. On the palate this has a somewhat watery mouthfeel but is quite a delicious mouthfeel. Oily with not much carbonation. I got no alcohol that I could detect in this one. A very nice stout. I enjoyed it and am happy that I got to try this one!

I am assuming this is the same beer. This pilsner pours a light gold color from the tap. Medium sized white foamy head. Aroma is cereal and grainy, slightly spicy. Medium to light bodied pilsner. The malts are cereal and grainy. The hops are floral and spicy. Good carbonation. Nice balance. Crisp and clean. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly spicy.
Il Vicino Pils;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Tap at one of the satellites. This looked and tasted like Bud Light. I don’t even want to describe the notes because of it.
Il Vicino Pils;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Deep straw color and minimal carbonation in the body. Thin head. Mild, fresh grassiness in the nose plus some buttery diacetyl that blends decently with the light malts. Light flavor with some citrus, pepper, and medium bitterness in the crisp finish. A fair pilsener.
Il Vicino Oatmeal Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Draft at the source. Very dark maroon color, small tan edge head. Aroma of bitter cocoa. Taste is dark milk chocolate. Tasty stuff, my favorite of the night at Vicino.
Il Vicino Oatmeal Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Jet black, not much lacing or head. A little thin on the body, hits roasty, coffee, some oats and hops, but had a rather bland finish. Good beer overall though.

Dark and thin bodied, slightly oily palate.
Il Vicino Oatmeal Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);On tap pours pitch black with a light brown head. Aromas of oats, and chocolate. Creamy in texture, a great texture for a stout that is not NO2. Roasty but not too much. Really a fair amount of hops for the style. A really sustaining drink. Very nice.
Il Vicino Oatmeal Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Pours dark brown with a thin head. Not much aroma to speak of. Thinly malty and light coffee notes. A bit of a dud.
Il Vicino Oatmeal Stout;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Stout;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);(Called Elmo's Oatmeal Stout). Rating is based on a growler purchased from the tap room in Albuquerque. Dark muddy brown/black with chestnut edges and a vanishing sudsy dust-colored head. Nice aroma of licorice, dark chocolate, and black coffee. Flavor is like a mixture of chocolate covered nuts and chocolate covered berries with a touch of smoke and a nice roasty finish. Body seems a little thin and watery. This is a good stout overall.
Millys Tavern Pumpkin Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Other;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;"From the 650 ml. bottle. This has been renamed ""Grumpy Pumpkin Ale."" The pour is a decent looking amber-orange with a quick lasting white head. Toasted bread notes lead the way on the nose and not pumpkin as one should expect. It’s more yam-like. Smooth and creamy and in the medium range. The pumpkin-yam character is very subdued considering it is a pumpkin ale. I get more of a toasted bread character. Mild bitterness."
Millys Tavern Pumpkin Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Other;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Draft at the source. Hazy golden color, small white head. Aroma of nutmeg, cinnamon, gourd. Taste is more gourd than spice. Subtle and balanced, not too spice-heavy.
Millys Tavern Pumpkin Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Other;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Tap at Milly’s in Manchester, NH. Served as a sampler size in a flight, and the glass was rimmed with sugar. Good pumpkin aroma and flavor, with cinnamon/nutmeg spices. Palate was moderate. Fun brew.
Millys Tavern Pumpkin Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Other;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Draft at the pub. They will serve it with or without sugar around the rim. I got the sugar. Nice pumpkin spice nose. The sugar adds to the pumpkin pie likeness, “cinnamon and spice”. Good drinkability goes down REAL easy. Pumpkin is light and not over the top. Carbonation adds a nice tingle in the mouthfeel. With or without the sugar it’s a nice brew. Well crafted.
Millys Tavern Pumpkin Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Other;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Interestingly enough, this was served on tap with a sugared rim. I promptly wiped away all the sugar... Clear orange amber with a small white head. Aroma is sweet caramel and biscuit malt with toast, vegetables, pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Flavor is quite sweet- caramel and biscuit come through again with brown sugar, Christmas spice, and pumpkin. Palate is medium bodied with a clean finish and average effervescence.
Millys Tavern Pumpkin Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Other;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;"On tap and brought a growler home. Pours a hazy yellow/orange color with a 1/2"" white head. Nose is subtle pumpkin. A nice mellow pumpkin flavor without all the extra spice that some pumpkin brews have. Served with the rim of the glass dipped in a brown sugar/sugar mix which added a hint of sweetness. They also give you some to take home when you order a growler. Hands down the best pumpkin ale I’ve had so far."
Millys Tavern Pumpkin Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Other;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Interesting that the color is light pumpkin. I’m happy that there are only subtle hints of pumpkin after the cherry junk I just had. Who would think I would enjoy pumpkin? Plus it was free. Thanks LyndaNova

Orange, hazy color, with a medium white head, sprinkled with brown sugar on top. Aroma is spicy, and malty. Flavor is just like pumpkin pie, and very spicy. Delicious, and I may even start spinkling brown sugar on all my pumpkin brews.
Millys Tavern Pumpkin Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Other;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Not a big fan of this style, though is one one of the better ones.The only drawback is the bartenders rim the glass with sugar and spice, though I think I might be one those 1% that doesn’t like it as all the other cattle bellied up to the bar seem to lick it up like candy.The pumpkin flavor is subdued but present,spices are faint at best.The one things this beer holds onto is that fact that it’s still a beer and not just a vehicle for a squash.

Bièropholie Bock Émissaire;Quebec, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Bièropholie;Nice caramel coloured head. Looks like a coke but darker. Super malt scent. Caramel and chocolat. Deep strong malt taste, caramel still strong. Aftertaste lingers a bit too long. Roasted smoke.
Bièropholie Bock Émissaire;Quebec, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Bièropholie;Originally rated March 2006. Bought at the Dépanneur de la Rive in Cap-Rouge, Quebec. Written 2005 on the label. Pours a dark brown colour with a big tanned head. Medium retention with some nice little streak lace. Good layer of cream and bubble stay on top of the brew. Reddish highlights come of the brew. The nose is of molasse, nuts and roasted malt. Semi-syrupy mouthfeel and full-bodied. Smooth start with the flavours, with roasted malts and going to a slight bitter finish of hop. Good balance of both in the aftertaste with the molasse. Quite nice.
Bièropholie Bock Émissaire;Quebec, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Bièropholie;Ha Ha Ha! Just found a place where they still have plenty of 6-packs of the 2005 vintage and I paid 8,99$ for one of them. Threatening my 1 month old boy or my wife’s life could be the only way I might say where I got it. I never tasted that beer before so I cannot say what 4 years of aging has done to it. I also bought a 6-pack of Mackroken Flower, vintage 2005, same price (the owners are ignorants... I like that!)... And before I opened a Mac, that I last had 6 months ago, the aroma and the taste of the Bock Emissaire reminded me immediatly of that Mac Scotch ale. I opened a Mac before finishing the Bock to compare. There are similarities but Mac is far more to my liking. The Bock, now. Very, very sweet aroma (ripe dates) and stronger than Mac, quite-dark brown color, also very sweet caramelized malt taste, spicy subtilities, little low carbonation. I think that the hop bitterness is a little discreet, maybe tampered by time, I don’t know, this beer is pretty complex and hard to describe, but the overall result is nevertheless now quite enjoyable. I will buy some more at this price. Better Sherlock fast ’cause I’m laughing a lot right now... Ha Ha Ha... (My selfishness is only a fake-attitude.)
Bièropholie Bock Émissaire;Quebec, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Bièropholie;"Big thanks to Glouglouburp for giving me this brew as an extra! Enjoyed while watching The Love Guru last night (horribly awful movie and not in a funny way). ***2005 Vintage*** The name of the beer is a play on words of the french expression ""bouc emissaire"" meaning scapegoat. Poured from a 341ml. bottle. Aromal: Boozy, leather, malty & toasted caramel. Stong aroma, a little pungent. Appearance: Dark brow body with definite amber/red tinges. Rusty colored and copper. Fairly good head retention considering the age. Tan head that clings to the glass. Flavor: Lighter than i thought. Malty feel with some caramel/toffee. A toasted feel around the edges of the mouth. Ends with a touch of bitterness. Palate: A little thin and muted, probably due to age. Smooth, malt is well balanced. A bit of nut and leather in there. Clean finish and a little (bitter?)sweet. Dry fruit and a slight coffee presence. Overall: Drinks fairly well. I would have another one. A pretty straightforward beer that still has some legs on it though age is starting to show. Taste is good though and i am looking forward to the new batch coming soon."
Bièropholie Bock Émissaire;Quebec, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Bièropholie;2005 vintage bottle. Poured clear, deep reddish-brown with a lovely initial cap of tan head. The aroma had a rich, aged soy and molasses character, nicely toasted with dark fruits laced through there.. deep and inviting, and much more powerful than expected. The flavor held the same impressive malt bill, but it didn’t come together as well.. charred molasses and maple at the core with some spicy, medicinal character on the edges.. muddled on the finish. Medium-bodied with low carbonation on the palate.. emptier on the back half of the drink.. bit rough at the end. Overall quite nice.

Bièropholie IPA;Quebec, Canada;IPA;Bièropholie;01-30-2008, as IPA #2 Appearance: Pours a hazy copper with a tinge of ruby with a 2 finger head. Smell: Dry hops aroma, aromatic with mild bitterness.

Bièropholie IPA;Quebec, Canada;IPA;Bièropholie;Vintage bottle. Still relatively clear amber coloured beer with a thick white head and quite carbonated. Slightly acidic aroma of mainly hops. It has a nice hop flavour with quite some bitterness. Could not find a best before date but it is at least 5-6 years old.
Bièropholie IPA;Quebec, Canada;IPA;Bièropholie;Originally rated December 2005. Purchased at the Dépanneur de la Rive in Cap-Rouge, Quebec. Pours a hazy caramel-amber colour with a tanned creamy head. Retention is quite long and lacing all around glass is great. The aromas are of caramel and molasse with hop in the background. The taste starts bitter, but gets more bitter in the finish to come back down to the starting point in the aftertaste. Coffee and notes of nuts lingers also in the aftertaste. Nice and smooth. Also in the flavours is burnt wood, oranges and butterscotch. A very nice complex brew.
Bièropholie IPA;Quebec, Canada;IPA;Bièropholie;Bottle- A slightly hazed orangey amber with a nice creamy foam. Zesty nose of citrus and fruit, piney hops, perfume. Tastes sweet, of caramel malts, grapefruit and lemony hops, a bit bready with cookie dough. Creamy and hoppy finish. Good stuff.
Bièropholie IPA;Quebec, Canada;IPA;Bièropholie;Bottle. Not quite sure how old this is, but it is quite old. Appearance is deep brown with thin head. Aroma: first impression was minty, fresh citrus a bit of herbs, eucalyptus freshness. Then we found some fresh vegetable and fruit aromas plums, beets, carrots and tomatoes. Taste is slightly roasted, cocoa powder and brown sugar. Watery at first but with a persistent finale, not too enjoyable. This beer is well past it’s prime.
Bièropholie IPA;Quebec, Canada;IPA;Bièropholie;Bottle from Bonisoir in Montreal. Pours a deep hazy brown with a fairly hefty tanned head. Loads of malt, bordering on barley wine aromas, with touches of plum and fruit. First impressions are that there is something odd going on here, as this is darker than pretty much any IPA I’ve seen, and comes out smelling like something full of malt, and not too heavy on the hops. Medium to thick body (especially for an IPA), and very malty, but not overly sweet. Finishes with a good amount of bitterness. I really have no idea what to make of this… it’s not really an IPA in my book (and blind I’d never peg it as one). More like a hoppy brown ale. Marginally drinkable (though I dumped about half of the bottle), but I certainly wouldn’t repeat this one.
Bièropholie IPA;Quebec, Canada;IPA;Bièropholie;341ml bottle 2.99$ at Grand Duc. Poured dark amber-mahogany. One half inch creamy head. Aroma is quite sweet, faint hops, hints of maple syrup (??). Taste is quite sweet, caramel, hops.enjoyable bitterness. Not quite crisp as I like my IPAs so far. Nonetheless a really nice beer, quite drinkable and well made. Rating #104
Bièropholie IPA;Quebec, Canada;IPA;Bièropholie;"341 mL bottle. A little dark for the style, and quite hazy. Nice foamy head, though. Aroma has loads of sweet caramel malt and light C-hops. Somehow, it smells creamy. The flavour is big, with caramel and piney hops from start to finish. Feels thin, but tastes full. It is better cold; it becomes a little too sweet when it warms. Excellent IPA."
Bièropholie IPA;Quebec, Canada;IPA;Bièropholie;"ANGLAIS: To me, it is Québec best IPA. This is so smooth and caramelised, with a delightful thick texture and a power bitter long lasting finish.

Bièropholie brassent, à mon avis, les meilleures IPA au Québec: celle-ci, la Cascade et la Golding. Des trois, c’est cette IPA que je préfère. Arôme intense, particulièrement agréable, goût puissant de malt caramélisé, où la domination de l’amertume du délicieux houblonnage amènent les fans de bières ""avec arrière-gout"" dans un autre monde, et la texture est onctueuse. C’est vraiment une excellente bière. Et cet arrière-gout qui persiste... Wow ! Ajout: Le vieillissement sied mal à cette bière; à bon entendeur..."
Tring Mother Haggys;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tring Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Smithfield Hotel, Manchester 09/08/2001 Golden coloured with fruity and pale aromas. Hoppy finish.
Tring Mother Haggys;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tring Brewery;A soft, light golden summer ale. Not as aromatic, and with more malty hints, than some in this style, but none the worse for that - they don't all have to have an overpowering blast of Cascade hops to succeed. Assuming that Tring Brewery has set out to produce an easy to drink and refreshing beer that appeals to a wide range of tastes, it has achieved that very effectively. A good quaffing ale, admittedly without a lot of complexity or subtlety. The Speaker, London SW1, August 2003.

Muted aroma of orange peel and caramel. Candy-like sweetness tempered by a basic hop bitterness. A nice balance. Long finish decent mouthfeel for a low ABV bitter. Pleasant bittersweet aftertaste.

Vale Best Bitter;Brill, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Vale Brewery;"The brewery claim this to be a new recipe and it is, to be honest a great improvement on the old one; much more hoppy and with a more balanced palate than the old version. Now called Vale Best IPA and although it won’t please the IPA Nazis, I quite enjoyed it. For comparison, I am leaving my old rate below. Mid-amber and very thin with little more flavour than that provided by the bittering hops. Short faintly bitter finish. Slight aroma of English hops is its only saving grace. Quite a poor example of the genre."

Spilker XPO Espresso Stout;Cortland, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Dry;Spilker Ales;Pour is dark brownish blak with a thin khaki head...smell is nice roastiness with hints of cocoa and vanilla...thin and watery mouthfeel with quite a bit of carbonation...hints of bitter coffee and vanilla in the finish...not so much a dry stout but more a sweet stout...this would be quite enjoyable if it had a thicker body...
Spilker XPO Espresso Stout;Cortland, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Dry;Spilker Ales;Pours very dark with tan colored head. Very bland, weak aroma. No significant flavors expected of good stouts. Seems like a lager with black food coloring. Stay away. Thanks for the state rating, Bu11zeye.
Spilker XPO Espresso Stout;Cortland, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Dry;Spilker Ales;Black with a good sized tan head. Aroma is similar to guinness. Has a weak milk smell complimented by a slightly stronger coffee aroma. The initial taste is bubbly on the palate which quickly changes to a more chalky feel. Taste is roasted coffee with some chocolate notes and a mildly bitter aftertaste.
Spilker XPO Espresso Stout;Cortland, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Dry;Spilker Ales;(32 oz. bottle with plastic twist-off cap) Pours a deep brown body with a small tan head. Sweet malt aroma with a hint of green chilies (agree with Nuffield). Somewhat thin palate for a stout. Absolutely no coffee flavor, which I will knock it down points for flavor and overall impression.
Spilker XPO Espresso Stout;Cortland, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Dry;Spilker Ales;Bu11zeye brought back a big bottle (with the twist off cap) from his homestate of Nebraska, and I wanted to do his state proud, but I couldn’t. An aroma of ginger beer, fajitas, and green chili. Nut brown color. Moderate palate. But worst of all was the lack of coffee in the flavor--where was it? I just couldn’t find the coffee here. Big thanks for the effort, Bu11zeye.
Spilker XPO Espresso Stout;Cortland, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Dry;Spilker Ales;"Sampled from a monstrous 32 oz. jug. ""1 Quart Stout"" I like the sound of that. Color is solid black, with reddish edges, and a small, swiftly diminishing head. Aroma is redolent with notes of espresso...ah, that’s the stuff! I’ve got my nose deep into it, to withdraw every aromatic morsel into my snoot. On the palate, bracing bitterness, but very mellow soon afterwards. Perhaps a bit overcarbonated, and lacking in the texture I like to find in stouts. There’s a lingering tinniness in the flavor, and it finishes rather weakly. Doesn’t compare well to Bell’s Java Stout, but then, in my book, few things do. Overall, a fairly average stout, with beautiful coffee aromatics."
Spilker XPO Espresso Stout;Cortland, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Dry;Spilker Ales;Beauty of a looker, here ... solid black with cascading tan head. Woodsy aroma ... subtle coffee flavors with definite smoke tones. Bit light bodied, but decent ... would go great with barbeque.
Spilker XPO Espresso Stout;Cortland, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Dry;Spilker Ales;When I can't find Spilker Monkeywrench Brown Ale, I'll settle for this one. Very strong coffee aroma and taste. Could bebefit from a little more O.G., but body is not something that Sam Spilker puts into his brews.
Spilker XPO Espresso Stout;Cortland, Nebraska, United States;Stout - Dry;Spilker Ales;Hum, twist off cap? Deep brown hue with fizzy head. The aroma hinted of roasted malt, nutty, mocha, light molasses, vanilla, aromatic hops, and pine. The taste was bitter upfront thanks in large part to the bittering hops used in this brew. A sweet mocha and citrus undertone was detected. The finish was very smoky and dry, bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel was thin, fizzy, and lively. Again this brew appears to be overcarbonated. This is just an average dry stout, needs more body and better mouthfeel. Okay to try once.

SLO Triple Eye Double IPA;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;SLO Brew;This beer was sampled at the San Diego Strong Ale Festival. There really wasnt a way to top the Barrel Aged Speedway at this point, so i was just looking for something to wake my taste buds up from the heaven they were experiencing, and this was it. It poured an orange/amber hue with a slightly thick white head which dissipated within 30 seconds. The aroma was filled with hoppiness and oranges. The taste was surprisingly malty, but once again very orangey and hoppy. A bitter clovey front following by a dry hopped citrusy finish rounds this beer out. Some malts right in the finish... nicely executed.
SLO Triple Eye Double IPA;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;SLO Brew;A very nice Ipa with the perfect balance of hops and malts. A Very nice brew... my favorite so far far from the brewery ce.

Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is bitter.
75th Street Imperial Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Imperial;75th Street Brewery;On at the brewpub. Pours a near clear dark brown with a deep wooden brown head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has strong roasted malts with hints of bitter chocolate and coffee. Flavor has more of a rich dark grain note with bitter chocolate and a touch of bitter roast.
75th Street Imperial Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Imperial;75th Street Brewery;Tap at the brewpub. The body was black with a light brown orange head. The aroma was milk chocolate with some coffee and low roast. There was also some dog. The taste was coffee with some stronger roast than the smell indicated. There was also sweetness with dark chocolate and walnuts.
75th Street Imperial Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Imperial;75th Street Brewery;brewpub. The beer poured a dark, nearly opaque brown color with an average-sized, creamy, medium-brown, mostly diminishing head. The aroma was heavily malty with notes of roasted grain and chocolate, moderately yeasty. The finish has a bit a smoky tone and some bitters as well. The feel is a bit sticky and warming but also metallic on the finish. This beer was good but didnt live up to other imp stouts.
75th Street Imperial Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Imperial;75th Street Brewery;"On tap at Mountain Sun in Boulder: Very dark brown; patchy head. Fizzy carbonation in a lightish body. Light elements of chalky cocoa, light roast, creamed-coffee sweetness, some alcohol fruitiness, and some bitter chocolate. Mild bitterness (grassy). Didn’t seem like 12 percent; if so, it was hidden very well. No major offenses, but not a lot going on, especially for an imperial."
75th Street Imperial Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Imperial;75th Street Brewery;Had this on draught at Mountain Sun, Boulder. The beer poured a dark, nearly opaque brown color with an average-sized, creamy, medium-brown, mostly diminishing head. The aroma was heavily malty with notes of roasted grain and chocolate, moderately yeasty with a note of soap, and miscellaneous traces of brine / green olives, and a light helping of something that smells like pungent fresh rosemary or bay—kind of like a cheap cologne. The flavor was lightly sweet, lightly acidic and lightly bitter with an average-length, lightly acidic, moderately bitter finish. The body was medium-to full, the texture was velvety and the carbonation was so soft it was nearly flat. I didn’t care for this one that much—it wasn’t very engaging in the nose or the mouth.
75th Street Imperial Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Imperial;75th Street Brewery;Draught, Mountain Sun. Head is mostly lasting. Body is black. Aroma is lightly malty (roasted grain), trace hops (resin), with a light note of rosemary. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Surprisingly uninteresting, though the alcohol seems to be hidden well (if indeed it is still 12%). Not labeled as a whisky/oaked stout.
75th Street Imperial Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Imperial;75th Street Brewery;Served in a snifter. Poured midnight black. Very dense. Full brown head. Aroma has notes of dark chocolate, tobacco, grape juice, and vanilla. Mocha, bitter dark chocolate, burnt marshmallow flavors abound. Full bodied, slick mouth feel, with lingering alcohol. One of 75th’s best efforts.
75th Street Imperial Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Imperial;75th Street Brewery;GABF 2005, Whiskey Imperial Stout (should this get it’s own entry?): Deep brown hued with a small head. The aroma has a twangy cherry and grape quality with chocolate, carmel, vanilla, and light smoky esters. The taste has lactic notes over a bittersweet malt and fruity nature. The finish has a bit a smoky tone and some bitters as well. The feel is a bit sticky and warming but also metallic on the finish. Good but I am somehwat underwhelmed. I was looking forward to this after having the IIPA.
75th Street Imperial Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Imperial;75th Street Brewery;Whiskey version. Very light nose - sweet butterscotch, putrid grains and steamed vegetables. Bland, simple - thick, yes - but fairly empty and leaving your mouth with a tinny finish. No thanks.

Very weak aroma some raosted malt and a tiny bourbon smell. Palate is ok coating and mildly carbonated. Flavor is a sweet front w/ whiskey lightly n the finish and a nice roasted malt. Good flavor but too small for an IS.

No visable carbonation. Lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and toffee malt character in the nose. Tons of spicey, fruit cake-ish flavor. Sweet up front, with a strong bitter finish. Coats the tongue, with a lingering alcohol burn. Pretty typical holiday offering.
75th Street Christmas Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;75th Street Brewery;Served with two cinnamon sticks floating amongst the foam. Malty, sweet, spicy aroma, of course some lingering cinnamon (which was likely used in the recipe as well), nutmeg and allspice, apple and pear fruitiness, toffee and perhaps a trace of herbal hop. Bright red-orange color, clear, with a white, subsiding head. Spicy, malty, sweet and mildly roasty flavor, becoming fruity and a bit more hop-flavored, with a nutty, tangy, spicy finish. Mild bitterness. Medium bodied, slightly fizzy palate. Not spectacular, but properly festive, I suppose.
Barley and Hops Winter Warmer (2003);Frederick, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - English;Barley and Hops Grill and Microbrewery;Pale amber color with almost no head. Smells and tastes mostly of baking spices. Smooth and pleasant. A nice enough beer, but a little on the light side for a winter offering. Like most of Barley and Hops's offerings, this could use a stronger flavor.
Barley and Hops Winter Warmer (2003);Frederick, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - English;Barley and Hops Grill and Microbrewery;Full bodied with a nice batch of spices, esp cinnamon and nutmeg. For such a strong beer, the alcohol is subdued and unobtrusive. A little lacking in overall flavor and complexity. Very dry aftertaste.
Barley and Hops Winter Warmer (2003);Frederick, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - English;Barley and Hops Grill and Microbrewery;Cloudy amber ale with no head.

Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Short, astringent, bitter finish. Great offering!
Mountain Sun 8 Ball Stout;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Growler. This is a nice sweet stout with good thick malty flavour. Nothing super special but good.
Mountain Sun 8 Ball Stout;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Draught. Body is dark brown to black. Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, caramel, chocolate), lightly hoppy (herbs, resin), with notes of vanilla and smoke. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety/creamy texture, lively carbonation. A nice stout almost as enjoyable as the Java Porter, but for me the hop aroma as it warms reveals that resinous PNW style that starts to ruin it for me. Still, very good and one of their best stouts, IMHO.
Li Berwette di Noyè;Ambly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Monon;Commissioned Christmas beer with yellowish white head and dark chestnut colour, misty. Fruity and spicy, liquorice, dried citrus peel touch, sourish accent and roasted bitterish finish. Quite good, actually.

Li Berwette di Noyè;Ambly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Monon;I don’t remember seeing ’di Noye’ on the label, but the colour matched this one 330ml bottle (One Pint, Helsinki) Cloudy dark brown, small tight persistent head. Sharp sour and spicy aroma. Massive spicy and sour taste. Tingly sourness and carbonation on the tongue. Final taste is more like coffee - rich burnt or roasted malts. With yeast, it’s softer, less sour, and nuttier. Some dark berries hidden in the bitterness and sourness.
Li Berwette di Noyè;Ambly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Monon;"From Ambly, Belgium 290398 Bottled (label says 33 cl but thiis bottle is 70!) Dark Reddish colour to match the season Sour at front but with time a hint of caramel sweetnes Spices og some cinnamon but especially a developing ""red berries"" flavor - strawberry This should have been as a barbeciue starter - though the dryness should be more balanced - but may be a suppliment to fat nordic Xmas lunch/meals"
Li Berwette di Noyè;Ambly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Monon;"33cl. bottle: A bit of a gusher. Dark brewed tea color under a massive beige cloud. Unstable head breaks down quite quickly. Big banana aromas fill your nostrils while spices seem to tickle your nose hairs. A small amount of cherry joins the action every now and then. Then all of a sudden the banana disappears letting cinnamon, cocoa powder and sweet caramel come forward. Upon tasting you are first hit with a tartness that you can’t yet place and then comes roast, distracting you from figuring out that tartness. Then lemon juice and orange peel jump forward saying ""ha.. it was me that you were looking for!"" Cocoa powder tries to grab your attention but the lemon and orange, in combination with the high CO2, keep it at bay till the finish where the cocoa and a touch of cinnamon and a touch of tin fight there way to the surface."
Li Berwette di Noyè;Ambly, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Saint-Monon;A Mes rate: Draught at Kerstfest, Essen. Dark cloudy brown with no head. Amazing hit of coca cola in the aroma with notes of yeast, citrus and malt but... OMG coca cola with knobs on!!!

Sucre, caramel et cendres sont intimidés par la vive puissance de l’alcool. Boisée style chêne, sucrée et toujours très alcoolique en bouche, une part de houblon à tendance floral est aussi présente. Impression vineuse, corps semi mince, grand réchauffement occasionné par l’alcool. Intriguant mais pas très bien équilibrée pour l’instant.
Rio Salado Oak Aged Redzilla;Tempe, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Orangey deep ruby-copper. Very light fading off-white head. Caramel and tree bark nose match the oak barrel in an abvious big arms alcohol showdown. Chocolatey, dry and woody. The carbonation is very light, oily slick palate, medium bodied. The aftertaste is long with alcoholic licorice nuances, vinous oakiness through the dry hops is vegetal in nature. I dug the aroma a bit more frankly, but this is interesting certainly. Thanks you cquiroga.
Rio Salado Oak Aged Redzilla;Tempe, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Thick, boozy, caramle aroma with woody vanilla prominent. Opaque amber-brown with low, off-white head that recedes to ring. Thick chewy, nutty malts, strong marzipan sweetness, alcohol, woody notes and fair finishing bitterness with lasting citrus aftertaste. Full body with moderate carbonation. Hand-bottled from a growler and enjoyed with bibi, beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, Olivier_MTL and Rastacouere.
Rio Salado Oak Aged Redzilla;Tempe, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Dark red pour with a ring of offwhite lace. Aroma of oak, strong alcohol and caramel. Flavor of oak,malt, caramel and strong alcohol. Light to medium body, creamy texture, soft carbonation. The alcohol is way to dominant, it feels boozey.
Rio Salado Oak Aged Redzilla;Tempe, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rio Salado Brewing Company;The Lure: Shining barrel weaponry at first scares the nostrils. Upon closer look though, portentous sweetness resides beneath the hot alcohol and barrel identity, as caramel and maple syrup run rampant, and I admit, quite seductively. Citrusy hops are somewhat overwhelmed by the purgative activity above, and remain low key. A little too boozy to be excellent imho. The Festivities: Slow-moving caramel malt and almond-y sweetness don’t get along with the nearby fruit salad. Citrusy hops are perhaps emulated by the tart fruitiness, and thus never show their true identity. Body feels somewhat tired with the low carbonation, and inefficient blend of flavors. Transcendence: A torch’s fire brings light when needed, but burns if mishandled.
Rio Salado Oak Aged Redzilla;Tempe, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rio Salado Brewing Company;Draft: Blurry crimson. Dirty-white head collapses to a tight ring. Buttery malt, vanillin, and perfumey whiskey aromas. Miniscule alcohol detected. Low carbonation, but washy and fuzzy. Lush frame of bready malt quells the immediate tannic acidity and alcohol which buckle the cheeks. Quite soft and almondy. Soured-fruit acidity soon follows to override the woody tannins. Assertive oak-derived vanillin with a butter-toffee kiss. Overly buttery, though, with meaty, diacetyl-laden malt notes. Oversweet, buttery finish of sticky toffee pudding and husky malts. Nice job concealing the alcohol, but this wreaks of diacetyl and uncleanliness, and the husky malts only compound this.
Rio Salado Oak Aged Redzilla;Tempe, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rio Salado Brewing Company;On tap at papago. Seamed to be all about the alcohol at first. Alcohol aroma and taste. Dark amber color body with thin head tha disipated quickly. At the end of beer had a roasted, burnt wood taste that wasn’t bad. A decent beer.
Rio Salado Oak Aged Redzilla;Tempe, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Rio Salado Brewing Company;I originally tried to taste this one at the Strong Ale Festival at Pizza Port in Carlsbad, but it hadn’t made it there when I tried to order it. I was glad to get a hold of this sample - bottled thanks to TAR. Poured a dark and cloudy red color with a small off white head. Aromas of stronger toffee, butterscotch, oak, and lighter vanilla. Tastes of caramel, toffee, and vanilla. Medium sweet. Goes down easy and smooth with a light alcohol burn in the end.

Buckeye Aquarium;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Buckeye Brewing Company;Julie sips and immediately says yuck overall a nice respective iOS and I am enjoying it
Buckeye Aquarium;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Buckeye Brewing Company;Tried on tap a while back. An O.K. rasp lambic. Somewhat thin in flavor. Also there seemed to be a disconnect between the malt and fruit. They taste distinct from one another in this brew seeming to somehow compete, not collaborate.
Buckeye Aquarium;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Buckeye Brewing Company;"Dark ruby amber w/a lasting just off white head. Raspberry and wet horses, and also a little catty! Perfect! There is also a noticeable sourness in the nose when chilled, but fades to a slight malty aroma as it warms. Raspberry, lightly tart and lactic, but not overly sour; malt and hop balance the tartness and co exist very well together, and has a horsey flavor as well as in the aroma from the bacterial yeast used. Lighter bodied and highly carbonated with an acidic bite on the tongue, but smooth otherwise. I don't generally like lambics, however, as lambics go, this is a very good representation of the style. In my experience they are a little more sour, but this is a great version from one of our local micros."
Buckeye Aquarium;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Buckeye Brewing Company;draft, Belgian fest, Buckeye Brewing 12-13-03. Raspberry stays for a short second, then gets somewhat tart, no sourness. On the watery side. Alcfron and I sampled this at the same time and of course we discussed it. I give Garin credit for attempting such a project.
Buckeye Aquarium;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Buckeye Brewing Company;"Deep red body, mostly clear. Raspberry up front - just for a second, then it's all about the tartness. Finished very dry, lots of tannins (grape peel), with a lingering ""wildness"" at the back of my throat. The only two shortcomings of this were it was thin and missing the sourness of better lambics. Garin's apparently got a lot of this - it'll be interesting to see how it develops with more aging."
Frankenmarkter Hefeweisse;Frankenmarkt, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bräu am Berg Starzinger;Sampled from bottle as ’Bräu am Berg Weizen’ at Biercult Vöcklabruck. Golden-orange, hazy body, with a big, fluffy, lacing, white head. Aroma of yeast, banana, orange, bread, vanilla, spices. Taste follows this pretty much. Medium, oily mouthfeel, with an average carbonation. Finishes a bit soft, yeasty, fruity, bready, sweet. OK. Average Weizen, a bit light and quite flat. Drinks fresh though, but there are much better ones from Austria.
Frankenmarkter Hefeweisse;Frankenmarkt, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bräu am Berg Starzinger;Bottled at Aldstadt Grill, Salzburg. Cloudy golden, rich creamy head. Fruity nose with light banana. Mid-sweet, mildly malty and mildly estery. Soem dough and a whiff of smoke together with salt. Restrained an mild in every way.
Frankenmarkter Hefeweisse;Frankenmarkt, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bräu am Berg Starzinger;Hazy pale yellow, small/mid-sized head. Wheaty, very slightly yeasty, with some very shy fruity hints. Quite watery, I wish the flavours were much much more intensive, I can hardly taste anything. What I can taste is good, just rather shy.
Frankenmarkter Hefeweisse;Frankenmarkt, Austria;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bräu am Berg Starzinger;Golden to light orange color, snall head. Citrus peel aroma. Taste is fruity, light sour and sweet, citrus notes. Light bitter aftertaste.
Dix Winter Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Dix BBQ & Brewery;Dark brown colour. Aroma of coffee, raisin, fruitcake. Thin, slightly coffeeish body. Slight tartness in the finish.
Dix Winter Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Dix BBQ & Brewery;Pitch black with a thin dark brown head. Faint aroma of caramel, dark chocolate and a touch of coffee. Flavour shows caramel sweetness up front, and a long bitter and roasty finish. Not really bad, but with an ABV as high as this, it needs way more complexity. As it warms, there is a bit of an alcoholic taste. The roastiness never seems harsh, but the body was a bit thin. The brewpub alternates between calling this an Imperial stout and a winter stout. It is definitely the latter and not the former.
Dix Winter Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Dix BBQ & Brewery;Black colour with lingering dark head. mild malt nose. good raost malt taste but a little to thin.
Dix Winter Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout;Dix BBQ & Brewery;Black with lasting tan head. Light roasted nose.Good roasted malt flavor with decent body
Mountain Sun Uber Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Draught. Body is hazy medium amber. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted bread, caramel, cookie), lightly hoppy (flowers, resin). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. Kind of like a bock in ale's clothing.
Three Floyds Ol Dread;Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On draft at DLD 2006. Pours a clear orange vistalite with a small off white head. Aroma of bourbon, pine, citrus and vanilla. Taste of bourbon, vanilla, pine, citrus and hops. Very nice, but slightly below the regular Dreadnaught.
Three Floyds Ol Dread;Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;this is a bourbon aged dreadnaught .a great idea maybe a little to much bourbon but i like it and it was strong.CHEERS to the guys for doing this
Three Floyds Ol Dread;Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;hated this. but i’m not a bourbon fan, and this was heavily bourbon flavored. my friend, on the other hand, liked it a lot more than normal dreadnaught. anyways, it doesn’t taste a lot like dreadnaught to me, but i will admit it was very hoppy. the Broo Doo is a better dreadnaught analog
Three Floyds Ol Dread;Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On again, off again, it feels as though I’ve rated this a dozen times already!!! This was luxurious, silky, creamy with aromas of leather, pine oils, vanilla, oak, alcohol. It was the beer of the year!!! One of the most beautiful beers ever poured into my glass. I scurried out of the brewery with a whole jug one time. Huge alcohol lurked underneath the vanilla-bourbon barrel wickedness. Hops like piney streaks along the sides of the glass waiting to grab you and pull you in. Damn, this was one hell of a beer!
Three Floyds Ol Dread;Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Poured a dark gold with an off white head and nice lacing. Strong bourbon hop aroma. Taste of bourbon, vanilla, and bitter hops as well with a creamy mouthfeel. This was really good, but I prefer regular Dreadnaught.
Three Floyds Ol Dread;Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;This is a mutation of Dreadnaught that has been aged in bourbon barrells. Very big mouthfeel, with Dreadnaught's accompanying sweetness. However, the bourbon character is ever-present. Mellowed with age? Perhaps...but not too much. Definitely not a session beer, but unique.
Three Floyds Ol Dread;Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Had this at 3F on 12/27/03. A small sized tan head with fine-large sized bubbles that mostly diminished. The body was cloudy with soft carbonation and a yellow hue. The nose was moderately hoppy and also of bourbon. The flavor was sweet, bourbon and some hop notes. This was a full bodied beer in my opinion and not one that I truly enjoyed.
Three Floyds Ol Dread;Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Mostly sweet aroma with some bourbon notes. Cloudy cider appearance. Caramely sweet flavor with some spicy hop notes. The extreme sweetness cuts way down on the hops and whatever else this beer used to taste like.
Three Floyds Ol Dread;Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;cask at RBSG 2003-year old aged dreadnaught-im going to keep this basic because i lost my notes from the summer get together. Basically, the hops are mellowed out and the malts are brougth up in the front. wonderful!
Three Floyds Ol Dread;Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;RBSG 2003: Nice head atop a brownish yellow body. Big malty notes with caramel. Light bourbon flavor. An excellent beer.
Shugborough Ale;Shugborough, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Shugborough (Titanic);Golden brown appearance which started off tasting quite dry, although a bitter edge soon appeared.Lots of other flavours lingered making for a quite comlex and interesting beer.
Shugborough Ale;Shugborough, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Shugborough (Titanic);Reddish brown coloured. Fruity aroma. Fruity flavour with hoppy notes and a rather bitter and dry finish. Quite tasty and well balanced.
Shugborough Ale;Shugborough, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Shugborough (Titanic);Bottle Conditioned. Dark brown with no head. Bought directly at Shugborough but obviously off. Sour tart and skunked, horrid.
Shugborough Ale;Shugborough, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Shugborough (Titanic);Bottle conditioned? Tart toffee notes when you first open the bottle, dark red brown colour with no head. Has a slight woody tang and plenty of raisin and winey notes, like a dry spicy fruit cake with a lipcoating oiliness and sweet finish. Reminded me of a aged blended beer like a flanders brown, but with not quite enough character.
Shugborough Ale;Shugborough, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Shugborough (Titanic);Best before Nov 04. This beer had a small sized head with fine sized bubbles that was mostly lasting. The body was carbonated, hazy with a brown hue. The nose consisted of malt and caramel with a bitter and malty flavor. The mouthfeel was somewhat bitter with some hops notes. This was a medium bodied beer with no lacing.
Shugborough Ale;Shugborough, Staffordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Shugborough (Titanic);Thanks to my friend Martin from England for sending me this fine ale. The bottle was marked best before Nov04. It poured a very small head of clear transparent bubbles that lasted a long time. The second pour showed the bubbles to be a brown color. The body was hazy carbonated and brown in color. The aroma was nicely malted and had mild caramel overtones. It formed a poor lace. The mouthfeel was bitter at the start, biting, hoppy and yet smoothened in the finish. It has a English bitter hop flavor with some brown malt notes. We had this beer with a pizza dinner and it went wonderully with it. Thanks again Martin! Congratulations too! It rated a 4!!!
Glen Ellyn Serenity Now Saison;Glen Ellyn, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Glen Ellyn Sports Brew;Draught: Huge yellow orange straw - thin film of white is persistent on top. Large orange, leathery aroma that has a fairly interesting animal hair component and some wild earthiness. Well rounded and semi-funky at times with flavours of iron, sunflowers, whole dry hop cones, and sour wine. The body and palate were on the thin side, but these other interesting notes made up for it. What an attempt for a sparkling clean brewery in the Chicago suburbs!
Glen Ellyn Serenity Now Saison;Glen Ellyn, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Glen Ellyn Sports Brew;Hazy amber with a fluffy off-white head. Fairly funky spicy hop nose. Citrus, a little pine and some sweetness. Somewhat thin body. Starts off soft and sweet with fruits and spice. A strong bitterness comes across in the lingering finish. It was pleasant to find a place where people will try to make a saison, not the best ever, but refreshing nonetheless.
Newport Beach Olde #7 Cherry Porter;Newport Beach, California, United States;Porter;Newport Beach Brewing Company;A fantastic find. A dark brown body with flashes of red coming through. A pink head. A wonderful aroma of chocolate, cherries, molasses, vanilla, oak and a touch of coffee. Smooth and full in the mouth. The flavor was superb and the length of aging was perfect. The vanilla, whiskey, oak and other flavors were present but not over the top. It was not too intense to drink, just very flavor and smooth. A fantastic find on my trip out west.

Potton Shambles Bitter;Sandy, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Potton Brewery;Rating from bottle collection/historic notes. Supermarket purchase.

An ok bitter.
Potton Shambles Bitter;Sandy, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Potton Brewery;500ml Bottle: BBD end of July 2014, poured into an Abbot Ale glass tankard at home on 28th May, some two months before it’s life ends. Obtained from a ’Wye Vale’ garden centre some time ago. Clear mid-amber body with a full and lasting off-white head. Malts lead the way in both the aroma and taste. Light, semi-sweet molasses in the nose push out any hop aromas while in the mouth the malts give a mild caramel and toffee flavouring that hides the hoppy bitter underbelly until the finish where a mini bitterness comes to the fore. I really enjoyed my pint (well 500ml then, not the correct 568ml).
Potton Shambles Bitter;Sandy, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Potton Brewery;Appearance: Clear copper with thin ivory head which was quick to disappear. Aroma: Caramel/toffee, slight pear note, biscuit, hay and grassy. Taste: Low sweetness, low/medium bitterness and sourness. Watery. Palate: Thick smooth texture, light body, astringent, low carbonation, abrupt dry malty and smoky finish. Comments: Did not seem to be balanced and was insipid. Ended up tipping it down the sink.

Clear pale amber in colour with a thin creamy white head. Floral hops in the short aroma. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing.

De Hemel Rooie Tiep Top;Nijmegen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Stadsbrouwerij De Hemel;Bottle, 1000 ml, bought at the brewery and poured into a tulip glass at home. ABV 8% Mostly clear body, deep orange copper in colour, with a small white head. Okay retention. Light lacing left around the glass. Aroma is not that pleasant at first, but after letting it breathe for a while and after a swirl of the glass too, aromas of bread appear, some fruity nuances too. Nothing great still, but better than before. Lots of malts and hints of alcohol, this one smells more like an imperial -or just strong- lager than a tripel or a belgian ale. Taste is more like the style. Yeast notes. Very obvious alcohol, lots of malts and sugar. Some light fruity notes with hints of apricot. It’s the kind of taste that always tells me that if I have too many - or much in this case- of this beer I’ll have a headache the next day. Medium thin body, carbonation towards the low side. Overall not impressed by this. Certainly didn’t worth the money.
De Hemel Rooie Tiep Top;Nijmegen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Stadsbrouwerij De Hemel;On tap at Drie Dorstige Herten. Hazy deep golden colour, white head.

Boulder Beer Randy Red;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Boulder Beer Company;Draft: Clear and medium amber. Light-bodied with a lively carbonation. Very sweet malts -- a little too soft, chewy and candy-like. Grassy, herbal hops were struggling to keep up and balance things out. Only a mild bitterness in the finish. Overall, it was drinkable, but I wasn't very impressed.

Madison Vermont Special Porter (VSP);Bennington, Vermont, United States;Porter;Madison Brewing Company & Pub;This is one dark porter. Had it on tap at the brewery. Little/no tan head. The maple syrup, though a nice vermont touch is overwhelming and ruined what could be an ok porter.
Madison Vermont Special Porter (VSP);Bennington, Vermont, United States;Porter;Madison Brewing Company & Pub;Not great. Pours a somewhat dark brown, but thin too. Aroma is sweet and toasty. Flavor is roasted malt and a tiny bit of english hops maybe. Very watery and lackluster.
Madison Vermont Special Porter (VSP);Bennington, Vermont, United States;Porter;Madison Brewing Company & Pub;"Deep dark brown coloured body with a super thin light brown head. Aroma of chocolate with some maltiness and not much else. Light-bodied; Strong chocolate and roasted malt flavours with some other light sweetness throughout. Aftertaste shows some bitterness, although the sweentess really comes through. Overall, not a horrible porter - on par with other brewpubs. I sampled this beer on draught from the brewpub in Bennington, Vermont on 23-October-2005."
Madison Vermont Special Porter (VSP);Bennington, Vermont, United States;Porter;Madison Brewing Company & Pub;My stepfather brought back a growler from this brewery and said it was their porter. I’m guessing it was this one. (it’s one day old) Black pour with a large head and good lacing and retention. Aroma is big time chocolate with an almost ashy characteristic I’m having trouble describing. I almost want to say smokey, but this is not smoked. Also there is quite a bit of caramel here. A hint of spicy hops in the finish, but still fairly sweet. Definite English feel here. Enjoyable porter, something different than the American ones.

"Steamworks Pilsener ""Vitamin P""";Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);"Draft at Alibi Room, Vancouver. Kind of surprised to see the lower ratings on this one; thought it a rather nice pils. Pours a golden color with little head. Faintly yeasty aroma, maybe just a touch of apple in there as well.

Oliver Hot Monkey Love;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oliver Brewing Co.;On tap 4 oz. sample at Maryland Microbrewery Festival at Union Mills Homestead in Westminster, MD on Sept. 29, 2012. I gather from other tasters that previous years' batches were mulch better than the 2012. Murky rusty brown with minimal head and fair lacing. Aroma of brown sugar, prunes, figs and caramel. Taste of alcohol, caramelized brown sugar and light hops. Very full body and medium/light carbonation. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Oliver Hot Monkey Love;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oliver Brewing Co.;Shared at my tasting on May 29, 2010. Thanks Brad & Scott! Hot Monkey Love (quite a name, eh?) pours a brown color with adequate head and lacing. The aroma smells like a strong brown ale, with some caramels and dark fruits, as well as alcohol present in the nose. The taste is pretty decent. I found the 11% abv to be very present, though not distracting. The overall flavors were not as big and bold as I expected and hoped. The mouthfeel was a bit thin, in my opinion. I would have preferred perhaps more malt and a fuller body. Overall, a pretty good beer, but not something I could consume too much of.
Oliver Hot Monkey Love;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oliver Brewing Co.;"Tap. Pours dark, nutty brown with average, frothy off-white head; short retention and some lacing. Aroma is figs, brown sugar, caramel and cookie malt, light floral hops, and faint spice.

Oliver Hot Monkey Love;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oliver Brewing Co.;On cask at the 2009 SPBW Real Ale Fest 10/17/09: Pours a transparent dark copper mahogany with an airy light tan head. Aroma of semi-sweet toasty dark caramel and light fruity esters with a toasty grainy maltiness. Starts with decent fullness and caramel maltiness with some resiny bittering hops before a drier, slightly warming finish. Needs more body and complexity for the style.
Oliver Hot Monkey Love;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oliver Brewing Co.;Wow, power packed with fire and flavor. Great, cnadied, sweet and wonderful maltiness. On second thought, maybe a little strong.
Oliver Hot Monkey Love;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Oliver Brewing Co.;Draft pre Father Day O’s game - This batch is 12%, not the advertised 9.5%. Good call Hopscotch. Chestnut brown and amber, thin creamy light tan head. As it warmed, the aromas played out with hints of musty caramel, dried cherry, and brown sugar, with lighter notes of sourness and melon. This was very well bittered throughout, but the sweet molasses, dark fruit, and caramel notes combine with the alcohol to provide decent balance. Medium to full bodied, light carbonation, bittersweet finish. The Wharf Rat is really starting to do things right these days. Good stuff...
Newport Beach Santas Lil Helper;Newport Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Newport Beach Brewing Company;"13-Apr-06 (Draft: O’Brien’s in San Diego, CA) Okay, I’ll throw out two words to describe the flavor of this batch. Sweet!! Spicy!! Good heavens, holiday spices abound and they are used in a very heavy-handed manner. Some bubblegum, citrus peel and a Belgian yeast character toward the finish, alcohol too, but this beer is so sweet and spicy, all the other flavors seem impossible to pick out. And the beer smells like spice cake too. Medium-full body, mostly from the residual sugar it seems. Moderately carbonated but still fairly cloying. Dark amber in color, fairly clear appearance. Small, light-tan head settles to a thin ring. Just way too overdone to be enjoyable.04-Dec-04 (Draft: 2004 Strong Ale Festival, Pizza Port in Carlsbad, CA. Day 2, Beer 1) The flavor is spicy (nutmeg), sweet, caramely and moderately bitter. The spice dominates and it’s not especially pleasant or enjoyable to me. Spice, nutmeg, light bubble gum in the nose. Medium body. The spice is tangy on the palate. Light amber color. Light tan head is small and is quickly a sheen. No lacing at all. This one is just ""okay"". (7, 3, 6, 3, 13 = 3.2)"

Creamish crisp malty Pils nose, slight lemon zest when it warms up. Very cooling, almost minty initial taste. Strokes of crispbread or nachos strachy malt in middle and a linger bringing the cool mint back into play with a herby, peppermint vibe. This doesn’t actually taste like mint, but everything up to that margin. Not as refreshing as I’d expected but not as flat a linger as I’d worried. Bottle, Provenance Wines, Edinburgh

Chateau Kamiya Pilsener;Ushiku-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Chateau Kamiya (Ushiku Beer);"My Bottom Line: Lightly toasted honeyed sugars dominate this Pilsener’s wooden, spicy hops in this full-bodied example. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the misty pale blond. -The nose does not foreshadow any crispness ; and the mouthfeel confirms that impression. -This is way too shy on the hop front. -The malt toastiness is harmonious with the wooden hop character.

Clear. Relatively rich, fragrant aroma of malt and hops; fruity, a bit buttery, very good hops. Hop-centered flavor. Malt is no slouch, but the hops are very good and the malt is simple and clean in the background. A bit fruity as well, with just a touch of citrus. Dry finish of malt and hops, not very bitter and very clean, though not “dry” and tasteless. Light, crisp beer with decent flavor and great balance. Very good overall, though not amazingly interesting. Aroma is better than taste."

Chateau Kamiya Helles;Ushiku-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Chateau Kamiya (Ushiku Beer);"My Bottom Line: This sweetish Helles’s loose bubbling and sticky honeyed cereals move into a bready second half where citrusy hop subtleties attempt to add character. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam covers the cloudy honey gold. -Hops also contribute geraniol here and there. -The flavor profile is forgettable and does not display any of the finesse usually associated with top notch examples of the style. -We were told this was a batch hopped with Cascade instead of the usual noble hop of choice. But there seemed to be other issues at hand in this batch ; was this even lagered the usual 4-5 weeks they had told us about in the brewery tour ? On tap at the brewery restaurant."

Town Hall Centennial Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Clear brilliant golden in color with a small off-white head and good lacing. Excellent hoppy aroma of citrus and pine, with just a hint of sweet malt behind it, almost west coast style. The flavor is also very nice and hoppy. Man I love me some Centennial hops. Grapefruit and pine needle flavors with very slight pale malt sweetness backing it up. Fairly light body, which improves the drinkability, and good crispness. Another big winner from Town Hall. These guys have impressed me.
Town Hall Centennial Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;10oz pour while waiting for Czar Jack growlers. Clear golden pour, very little head, very little lacing. Aroma is all about the hops. Pretty standard aroma, can tell its Centennial for sure! Also a bit a sweet caramel malt. Flavor is much the same. A very solid, easy drinking pale ale, with nice hop highlights without edging into the IPA land.
Town Hall Centennial Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Sampled on tap at the brewpub (Minneapolis, MN). Pours a nice glowing golden amber hue, a nice moderate frothy offwhite head, laces ok. Aromas are a nice bite of citrusy hops, lemon and grapefruit. Simple, lighter, with some fresh vibrance. Initial is lighter, soapy and melon hops, grapefruit, lemon. A decent hopping, with decent bitterness, clean and soapy, with citrus, dry, soapy. Hops are fresh, lemon and melon slant is different, with a high drinkability and good dry and bitter finish. Nice hop profile, a tasty fruity melange without getting cloying, solid bitterness
Town Hall Centennial Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Draft. Poured intoa pint glass a golden yellow color with surpsinglly very little head. What head their is a slight coaster or white that clings to the glass. Very orange fruit forward aroma with a sweet note as well. Medium/light mouthfeel. Slightly sweet, bready start with an orange flavored hop flavor. Lingering bitterness but nothing to crazy. Pretty easy drinking. My only grip is the lack of head and lacing.
Town Hall Centennial Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;RBSG 07. Clear copper, small head. Fruity, juicy, citrus, resiny aroma, very fresh. Same flavor. All hops here. Bittersweet. Medium to medium/light body, balanced. From notes.
Town Hall Centennial Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"On cask. Poured a nice slightly hazy, golden color with a beautiful head that only cask can deliver. Smell was citrusy and piney, with a soft biscuit note hidden in there too; even though the smell wasn’t real strong, it was still very nice. Taste is certainly hoppy, but there is an almost perfectly balanced malt backbone to it. Hints of sweet malt hidden behind a generous amount of hops in just the way Town Hall knows how to do it. Low carbonation levels and a medium body make the mouthfeel almost creamy smooth. Just amazing drinkability, I wanted to sit and drink this all day, but sadly I didn’t have enough time. Make a point to try this one when it’s available."
Town Hall Centennial Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On tap at the brewpub on 6/22/07: Pours a transparent deep bronze with a full-lacing clingy white head. Aroma of big fresh citrusy hops and lightly sweet pale malt. Body starts with good light malty sweetness, nicely balanced with an assertive grapefruity piny hoppy balance. Very smooth, crisp and flavorful toward a slightly drier, lingering bittersweet finish. A very nice APA.
Town Hall Centennial Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours a hazy orange amber, it remains hazy even after the cask pull cascading is long gone. Topped by a good inch and a half of thick creamy white foam. Great head retention. Fantastic thick paint-like, count-the-rings lacing throughout the pint. Perhaps the best lacing I have ever seen. Mild hop aroma, lightly citrus. No indication of what’s to come... I love the flavor - bold hops that are pine, floral, and citrus. These dominate the flavor, but there is an easily discernable malt backbone that is lightly sweet, and even a hair astingently smoky. A delicious grapefruit pithy bitterness shows up in the finish and lingers a good long time in the aftertaste. Medium body, very fresh and flavorful, with absolutely perfect soft carbonation.
Town Hall Centennial Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours a yellow/orange with a nice creamy white head. Nice citric aroma and taste is the same with a nice persistant bitterness throughout. Nice mouthfeel. Another nice solid beer from Town Hall.

Pigs Eye Lean;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pigs Eye Brewing Company;Pours a golden color with a very small head. The aroma is chemically and sweet with some sweet corn... sort of sweet all around. The flavor is fruity with some of the chemical and corn but not as dominant as it was in the aroma, there’s even a mild hop bite! Hands down the worst beer I had on Saturday.... come on Pig’s Eye I know you can do better.
Pigs Eye Lean;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pigs Eye Brewing Company;Sampled at the 2009 Great Nebraska Beer Festival. Pours pale yellow with a thin white head.

Pigs Eye Lean;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pigs Eye Brewing Company;Ah, Shawshank Redemption. Great movie, I can’t get enough. Every couple months I toss it in the DVD player. It has a great cast, soundtrack, storyline and scenery. It also has some great quotes, some I use from time to time. Pigs Eye lean reminds me of when Andy Dufresne escaped from Prison – he crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side. After being wrongly imprisoned he spent years plotting his escape knowing he’d have to crawl to freedom through 500 yards of shit smelling foulness I can’t even imagine. Or maybe I just don’t want to. 500 yards. That’s the length of five football fields. Just shy of half a mile. But if the river were filled with Pigs Eye lean, I’m pretty sure he would have just done his time. Straw yellow, medium white head. Aroma is nasty (see above) with stale grains, corn and light apple complete with the worms. Taste of stale malt, stewed vegetables and bad apples. Astringent and awful and worthy of my first ever 0.5 rating!
Pigs Eye Lean;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pigs Eye Brewing Company;Can poured a clear pale yellow with a small lingering white head. Aromas of straw and light corn. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a watery finish. Flavors of light corn and a hint of straw with a crisp clean watery finish.
Pigs Eye Lean;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pigs Eye Brewing Company;Not the worst you can do. Really not impressive, but for a Pale Lager you can’t expect much beyond a typical pale lager...
Pigs Eye Lean;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pigs Eye Brewing Company;Golden in color with a white head. Clean, crisp brew. I thought this was a good beer but I wouldn’t go out of my way to drink it.
Pigs Eye Lean;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pigs Eye Brewing Company;Sampled at ABR 07 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Pours a clear golden straw brew with a fast dissolving white head that dissipates clean. Aroma of light multi-grain malt, some corn malt character and some grassy hops. Taste? What taste? Just barely some corn malt and that’s it. Finish is clean cut with no bitterness or any aftertaste flavor. At least the low-carb dieters will be happy with this brew.
Pigs Eye Lean;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pigs Eye Brewing Company;ABR 2007. UWatery grain nose with a little bit of honey in an otherwise light grainy body.

Blue Cat Ichabods Pumpkin Ale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Blue Cat Brew Pub;On tap,flight sample:Soapy aroma soapy taste,something very off in this.Light bodied,strange flavor abnormal from pumpkins.One of the worst pumpkins ive had. Tastes like its dryhopped with mold then dish detergent thrown on it. Maybe its just artificial pumpkin flavor.
Blue Cat Ichabods Pumpkin Ale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Blue Cat Brew Pub;On tap at the brew pub. (2008) I enjoyed this because it was light and not overspiced like some pumpkin seasonals.
Blue Cat Ichabods Pumpkin Ale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Blue Cat Brew Pub;tap. totally unimpressed. orange-brown in color with very little sudsy head. I could smell the spice somewhat, ginger and pumpkin being the most recognizable. very thin and watery. honestly tasted like watered-down pumpkin pie. I would pass on this for a seasonal ale.
Blue Cat Ichabods Pumpkin Ale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Blue Cat Brew Pub;on tap at the brewpub. sweet aroma of pumpkin spices, cinnamon and maybe some ginger. flavor is much the same, but this beer is thinner than water! if it’d had some body, it would make for a nice seasonal brew, but its just too thin.
Blue Cat Ichabods Pumpkin Ale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Draught at the brewpub. Clear golden-orange color that didn’t really draw me in. Head was paper thin and white, but did last longer than average. It didn’t leave any lace on the glass, however. Aroma was not overwhelming with notes of cinnamon doughnut and light pumpkin pie. Dry on the tongue with strong flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg accented by a touch of root beer. There was also a fleeting malty cereal grain aftertaste. So so.
Blue Cat Ichabods Pumpkin Ale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Blue Cat Brew Pub;I’m assuming this is the correct brew,.Light amber color,no head to speak of.The aroma is mild and weak with maybe a hint of pumpkin some light spice and a light malty side.The flavor came much the same as the aroma,light malt some faint hints of spice and little more then that.Over all a pretty weak example for the season.
Archers Robin Red Breast;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask condition, handpull, Simple Simon’s, Canterbury. Mahogany colour, lasting bubbly beige head. Not a huge aroma. Bit watery in mouth, with syrupy red fruit malt. Not a huge amount of hop, it’s just a bit of red syrup in water. Dull, dull, dull.
Archers Robin Red Breast;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask conditioned - handpump - Malt Shovel Northampton. A copper coloured beer with a sharp lemon hop aroma. The taste is crisp and clean, again with citric hops noted. The beer was a bit colder than the other cask ales I had this session and it seemed to serve it well. Even the smell was on the cold side but it all worked. A refreshing drink.
Archers Robin Red Breast;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Conditioned at The George & Dragon, Shutford, Oxon. Golden brown colour with thinnish head. Whilst other British brewers raise their ABV's for winte brews, Archers appear to have gone for a light little confection here. Light malting and an overlaid hoppy tanginess, easily dinkable and totally safe, is this what we want from Winter beers?
Archers Robin Red Breast;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Presumably yet another occasional/seasonal beer from Archers - is there no limit to the number they can churn out? I have often found that Archers bitters have rather more residual sweetness in the finish than I like, so I feared for the worst with this one, which, judging by the name, is a winter beer. I was, however, pleasantly surprised. The aroma is clean and, as Silk Tork says, had citric tones, but was rather restrained. There was a reasonable balance on the palate but, again, nothing very assertive and things tended to peter out towards the finish. For some reason, though, I found this beer rather more satisfying than those comments would suggest. A very pleasant, if not too demanding, bitter. Handpump, Head of Steam, Euston, London NW1, December 2003.
Archers Robin Red Breast;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);"Cask Fresh @ Wenlock. Trad bitter colour. Marris Otter, but very nicely made. Citric hops. Nice. Fades as drink progresses, the hops making less of an impression while some of the blander, fatty, oily qualities of the Marris Otter malt make themselves known. A friend I was with wrote ""Warms your willy"" on my notebook while I was feeding the meter. I'm not quite sure what he meant."
Blue Cat Finnegans Irish Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Draft at Blue Cat. Poured a dark brown, almost black color with a small, tan head. Aroma was roasted malts, some light sweetness. Very light chocolate, some coffee. Probably would be improved if it were on nitro to be perfectly honest. Mild sweetness, a touch thin.
Blue Cat Finnegans Irish Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Sampled at the brewpub. Black with a tan head. This is roasty and sweet. Something almost lactic but not quite. Some earth. Also something kind of sour, unplesant, too.
Blue Cat Finnegans Irish Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Blue Cat Brew Pub;On tap at the brewpub, Rock Island. Better than the amber/ESB/whatever I had, this was a nicely roasty dry stout that could have used more heft in the body. But the mouthfeel was pleasantly chalky and the flavors were appropriately bitter, going well with the meat on my plate.

Blue Cat Finnegans Irish Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Handbottled: Pours nearly opaque with a lasting creamy tan head and left very good lace upon the pint glass. The aroma has notes of milk chocolate, coffee, walnut, hint of smoke and paper, and just a dash of spice. The taste pretty much follows suit with heavy roasted and sweet malt tones but has a nice addition of smoke and bitterness on the finish. The most impressive thing with this beer is the mouth feel which is fuller than most in the style, creamy and smooth with a light bitter bite. It is quite the lovely drinking stout. When judgement versus the genre it is above average and something I would seek out again.
Blue Cat Finnegans Irish Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Growler from the brewpub. Dark pour with a tan head. strong aroma of coffee and maybe some chocolate, but mainly coffee. Too much coffee in the flavor for my tastes.

Blue Cat Finnegans Irish Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Blue Cat Brew Pub;22oz hand bottled by Duane! - Thanks! - Pours black with a nice frothy tan head that stays pretty well.

Blue Cat Finnegans Irish Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Blue Cat Brew Pub;On tap at StoutFest. Poured dark brown with a very nice initial cap of caramel head. Aroms found dry chocolate and darker fruity notes, mild coffee, and some musty notes creeping in as it warmed a bit. Flavor had a very enjoyable undercurrent of molasses and other dark sugars.. dark chocolate, plums, and raisins all represent. Medium-bodied with a decent flow.. odd molassessey finish. Solid.

Pours dark brown with light beige head. The aroma is kind of roasty with some smoke notes, lots of toffee, bitter chocolate, some vanilla, and toast. The flavor is bitter chocolate, some toffee, woody hops, and an ashy and slightly smoky finish. Not bad."
Blue Cat Scottish Terrier;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Pours a clear medium brown with a thin, creamy, light tan head that has poor retention. Aroma is burnt sugar, earth, a touch of smoke, light woody hops and a touch of black tea. Flavor is sweet toast, faint peat smoke, a touch of wood and light caramel, overall, pretty weak flavor. Palate is thin and a bit dry with a light carbonation. Not bad, but thin and lacking depth in the flavor profile department.
Blue Cat Scottish Terrier;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Draft at the brewpub. Advertised as 7.3% AbV. Poured a clear dark brown color with orange highlights. head was khaki, one finger high, and reduced over a few minutes to a thin film. there was a bit of lace left on the glass at the end. Smelled of milk chocolate with hints of peated malt, sassafras, and anise. There was also an occasional whiff of what reminded me of adhesive tape. Dry on the tongue with a slightly acidic finish. Tasted of chocolate and peated malt. Not bad.
Blue Cat Scottish Terrier;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Blue Cat Brew Pub;tap at the brewpub. after drinking a Stone Smoked Porter last night, I could not find the smoke in this one! don’t get me wrong, I thought this was a decent scotch ale, good malt flavor and all. I just never found the smoke.
Blue Cat Scottish Terrier;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Blue Cat Brew Pub;The bartender thought I wouldn’t like it because I was a girl. Did I therefore feel compelled to like it? I don’t think so. I really did think it was very good, sublte smoke and peat, with rich malt and a smooth round flavor.
Blue Cat Scottish Terrier;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Blue Cat Brew Pub;"On tap at the brewpub. Dark brown in color. Pours with a strong rich dark head. Smoke aroma is pronounced. Taste is very smooth. Smoke flavor is developed, but not aggressively overpowering as many smoked beers are. Also unusual is that this is an ale, not a lager. They still call it a rauchbier. In fact, here is the official commercial description: ""Scotch Terrier Rauchbier- Brewed annually for the Celtic Highland Games of the Quad Cities with peated malt, giving it a smoky, earthy taste. This is the best beer that Blue Cat pours."

Blue Cat Anniversary Ale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Draft at the brewpub. I guess they make the same style for every anniversary? This one was made for their 13th. Advertised as 6.2% ABV and 19 IBU’s. It poured a hazy orange brown color. Head was white, thick and foamy with good retention and lacing. Smelled of malty cereal grain, light brown sugar, and subdued sprucy hops. Initial flavor was a burst of fresh cereal grain and malty caramel. Unfortunately my taste buds soon became numb to these flavors and they were replaced by a resiny-grape candy note. As I try more and more of this brewpub’s beers, I notice this strange flavor in many of their offerings.
Blue Cat Anniversary Ale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Produced for their 12th anniversary. The body is a dark pleasing copper with a white head. The aroma had walnuts and some oranges. The taste was toasty with smoked almonds and some dry oak in the finish. A very smooth and slick body make this a great sesion beer. A decent rendition of the style.

Brewsters Lanigans Irish Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Appearance: clear medium amber with one fat finger of light beige head, good retention and lacing. (4/5) Aroma: caramel and toffee malts, light smoke, nutty. (5/10) Taste: moderate-high sweet, moderate bitter. (4/10) Palate: medium body tending to watery, moderate carbonation, malty slightly metallic finish. (2/5) “Lanigan’s Irish Ale”, huh? Sounds about as authentic as “Tipsy McStagger”. A fairly uninspiring interpretation of a stye that I find unexciting at best. Thinnish and malty, without much to recommend it. (10/20)
Brewsters Lanigans Irish Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Pours a clear deep copper with reddish hues and a small white ring of lace. Aroma of caramel, toffee, toasty malts and some fruity esthers. Flavor is caramel, toffee sweet maltiness, nutty and some mild roast character and a dry finish with some mild hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and water like reducing the full effect of the sweet grains and a low carbonation. Overall the beer is nice to drink but needs a fuller body and the fruitiness in the aroma needs to be cleaned up.
Brewsters Lanigans Irish Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;On tap at Brewsters Castledowns. 4.7%. Clear, dark amber pour with a decent tan head, good retention. Aroma is roast malts, almonds. Taste is more malt, nutty, and a hint of toffee. Creamy mouthfeel, with a hoppy note in a smoothish finish. Definitely worth another.

Brewsters Lanigans Irish Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Clear reddish brown pour with small off white head.

Brewsters Lanigans Irish Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Faintly aromatic, reddish brown in colour. Some sweetness, but again, like a lot of these Brewsters beers, it tastes nutty, tinny and watered down.
Mercury Genuine Draught Cider;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Apple Cider;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);A classic cider with a refreshing taste. Great for the rainy days at home. Every Tasmanian will agree this is a staple in all the pubs in the cider range. On tap on every Pub in Hobart. Great taste and is up there in my top 3 favorite ciders
Mercury Genuine Draught Cider;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Apple Cider;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Sampled at Cacade in Hobart. Yellow body. Sweet. A pretty basic cider. Acceptable.
Mercury Genuine Draught Cider;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Apple Cider;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);750ml bottle into shaker. Granny smith aroma but faint. Pale, pale yellow/green appearance, medium carbonation, zero head. Zingy in the mouth, mild toffee-apple taste gives way to a light tartness. Easy drinking, does the job in summer.
Mercury Genuine Draught Cider;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Apple Cider;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);375ml bottle, 5.2%, from Dan Murphy’s, Hurstville, Sydney, NSW. Clear pale yellow gold colour, white foam head that quickly dissipates away and aroma of mellow apple. Taste is apple, fruity, bittersweet. Medium bodied, low to medium carbonation, dry slightly tannic finish. Quite OK.

Mercury Genuine Draught Cider;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Apple Cider;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);"375 ml bottle bought at CitySuper in New Town Plaza, Shatin. Clear pale golden colour; No head and only a bliss of pop-like thin white foam which fades in 5 seconds; No lacing with initially small and fizzy carbonation; Slightly tart aroma of apple fresh, apple skin, light yoghurt, hint of sugar and light sparkling wine; Mid to light sweet, and strong tart taste of dry sparkling white wine, apple mesh, booze, light tannic, sugar, and hard carbo; Light body, watery palate; Mouth feel is tart-driven, apple mesh or concentrate in hard-carbo sparkling wine body followed by dollops of syrup which is quite strange but neither cloying nor unpleasant. Not much tannic nor woody taste. Alcohol taste is a bit harsh, a bit scrumpy-like but still localized. Blurrping finish; Slightly dry after taste, very easy to mouth. Comments: An over-carbonated macro cider, not much astringency or wood but has some genuine apple character, and the tartness is strong and dominative. Middle of the road, good for easy drinking."
Mercury Genuine Draught Cider;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Apple Cider;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);My poison don't knock it. I have been a cider monkey all my life.

Mercury Genuine Draught Cider;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Apple Cider;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle @ Home A remarkably good cider considering it is mass produced, and inexpensive. It delivers everything you’d expect of a pleasant cider, but not much more. Definitely worth a drink.
Mercury Genuine Draught Cider;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Apple Cider;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);375ml bottle. Pale and light looking , the colour of champagne. Sweet crisp apple aroma with a nice sweet apple flavour that cleanses the palate.

Lean body, fizzy carbonation. Slightly off dry palate, doesn’t carry much apple flavour, more white vinous twang than anything. Finishes with a faint acidity, bit of a skunky aftertaste. Not great."
Mercury Special Dry Cider;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Apple Cider;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Best cider i’ve had anywhere in the world. That clear energising taste stays with you, a delight in all ways except availability in Sydney is sometimes problematic. In Tassie they have it running from the bubblers!
Mercury Special Dry Cider;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Apple Cider;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);"375ml bottle. Pours a very pale straw yellow, with a faint greenish tinge; it’s far from the best-looking cider I’ve seen. The nose has dried apples with a hint of cane sugar sitting over a nutty backdrop. Tart green apples start it off, mingling with a touch of lemon and then leading into a sweeter apple finish. The palate, oddly, is a little less dry than Mercury Draught, being slightly too far to the sticky side of things. Whilst nowhere near the excellent standard of Draught, this is not a bad cider, and for an Australian macro, it is excellent."
Mercury Special Dry Cider;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Apple Cider;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);375ml bottle. Very clear with moderate carbonation. Light in colour with a faint apple aroma and dry and airy in the mouth. Cleansing aftertaste.

Bulmer Australia Strongbow Classic Dry;Campbelltown, NSW, Australia;Apple Cider;Bulmer Australia (AB Inbev);330ml bottle. Passable, although far from the best cider around. It lacks much bittersweetness, instead there is a mostly sweet flavour, with a slight background tartness. Drink it if it’s offered to you, but don’t buy it yourself.
Bulmer Australia Strongbow Classic Dry;Campbelltown, NSW, Australia;Apple Cider;Bulmer Australia (AB Inbev);Very pale yellow in colour. A little, but not much better than Bulmers Strongbow Sweet. It’s not quite so overbearingly sweet and it is dryer. Not great though. - 330ml green glass bottle.
Bulmer Australia Strongbow Classic Dry;Campbelltown, NSW, Australia;Apple Cider;Bulmer Australia (AB Inbev);Straw yellow/gold. A bit on the sweet side to call dry.Rather fizzy and no more interesting than a bottle of sparkling apple juice from the milk bar.

Bulmer Australia Strongbow Classic Dry;Campbelltown, NSW, Australia;Apple Cider;Bulmer Australia (AB Inbev);The last of the Strongbow lot and I’d guessed it to be the worst of them, but alas I’d have to say this was a hairs width above the rest. Poured into a tallboy glass, clear palest lemony yellow with large bubbles clinging firmly to the glass, taking a good shake and swirl for them to rise. No head past a ring of said bubbles as they slowly rose. Sulphurous?, mineral-like? and very sharp, biting, soft pulped apple nose with an underlying chemical note reminiscent of chlorine? (?= unusual for a cider, unusual for anything beverage-wise). Initially there was nothing but citric and carbonic acid in the mouth, puckering and tart without any flavour to point the blame at. Apples are in there but well hidden, with a very light note of sweetness keeping it from being too dry, and a very feint stale, bruised apple note that lingers in the mouth after each swallow. Allowed it to sit for a few minutes as the carbonation was starting to p!$s me off, and it did actually wane to reveal a little more fresh apple flavours and some solid acidity. It was otherwise not that bad, went down with the ease of a glass of riesling, so I can’t say it was too offensive. It just wasn’t that good a cider!!! (375mL, 5.0%, 18/05/07)
Nordik Wolf Light;Falkenberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Sverige;Had the privilege of drinking the original Nordic Wolf and not the light. It was a great tasting beer with just the right amount of alcohol kick. Things were. Brew different back in 84-86.

Bondi Red Natural Ale;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Nice flavor & aftertaste in this ale. Crisp & pleasant. Good going down. Nice head & defintie keeper!
Bondi Red Natural Ale;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);"Not so much a microbrew as a marketing exercise. The ’Bondi’ brand will mean it should sell moderately well to tourists and novelty-seekers. Best bits: preservative-free; reasonably inviting aroma with some herbal and tobacco notes. Worst bits: thin body; abrupt finish; and as Mullet observes, it’s not red. Better than the same brewer’s Blonde but only marginally."
Bondi Red Natural Ale;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);The Bondi Beer Company is a new brewery from Bondi (Sydney), who in short don’t make a great beer. It was a darkish amber colour with a bit of a hazy appearance. The aroma and flavours weren’t great, nothing really stood out, except one large fault, the levels of diacetyl were way too high, one could drink it, but by the end it was getting hard. Maybe they will improve with time, who knows. Considering that they plan it to be a direct competitor to James squires amber ale I think they have a long way to go.
Bondi Red Natural Ale;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Very orangey colour that doesn't appeal. The head lasts for a short time leaving the glass looking a bit flat and muddy. A bit of vegetable in the nose but not a lot of anything else. The taste is poor and the wheat probably detracts from the body of the beer but who really cares? It is a thin and flavourless beer. I wish, I really wish, that we could have some brewers actually thinking about the essential ingredients of beers, and follow up with a real attempt at breweing something with character. I am getting tired of paying $4 for crap.
Bondi Red Natural Ale;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Smells dodgy - canned tomatoes, rust. Much more flavour than the Blonde - caramel, a hint of chilli flavour (seriously) but not the heat and just-perceptible bitterness. Oh yeah, this beer ain't red. It's light amber at best.
Bondi Red Natural Ale;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);soapy, sweet and honeyish, indistinguishable from the blond except for a slightly more orange colour and a label that congratulates you for liking beer with character. microbrewing at its most insipid - obviously brewed competently but with no attempt at any sort of flavour.
Bondi Red Natural Ale;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);it's good to see bluetongue are finally up and brewing because when i went to the brewery they were only serving stuff from queens wharf brewery. anyway this was bland and thin and all one would expect from gimmicy aussie beer
Bondi Red Natural Ale;Cameron Park (Hunter Valley),NSW, Australia;Red Ale - Irish;Bluetongue Brewery (SABMiller);Not really red in colour, lightish amber, same label as the Blonde (surf dude), only with a red border. Pretty much tastes like the blonde, with a hint of toasty nuttyness and a touch of honey, but really not enough flavour to keep me interested. Clean, watery and pretty boring.

If this was dry, I’d like it as an amber but it will disappoint mist hopheads. I will say the fermentation is nice and clean so it’s skillfully brewed but the recipe is just not all that great.

Its flavor was initially that of mild hops but the hops come out in the finish making the flavor flow from one extreme to another. A very interesting beer I thought. The owner said he didn't know the ABV of the brew and didn't care what it was. All he cared about was ""Did you like it""?"
Tindall Best Bitter;Bungay, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tindall Ales;Bottle Conditioned.

Charlie and Jakes Oktoberfest;Melbourne, Florida, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Charlie & Jakes Brewery & BBQ;Draft at Charlie and Jakes in Melbourne, FL. Where's the cranberry aroma and flavor?? This beer had a small sized white head that contained fine sized bubbles that mostly dissipated. The body was uncarbonated and cloudy with a yellow hue. The nose was lightly malty and I cannnot comment on the flavor because I could not detect any. The mouthfeel was watery and thin making this a light bodied beer. This beer did however have a good lacing to it.

Bear Republic Rye Pale Ale;Healdsburg, California, United States;Pale Ale - Rye;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Tap at Rattle N Hum. Pale amber gold pour. The nose is a bit hoppy with a little bit of orange peel and a whiff of light citrus as well. Fruity and a bit chewy but the rye malt is very well-hidden. Softly hoppy on the aroma but the bitterness is actually quite assertive. As it warms up there is a little bit of diacetyl – which I don’t recall ever seeing in a Bear Republic beer. A touch of light spice on the finish. It’s okay – but it’s not great.

Pale golden, aroma is vaguely sweet in a honey/cookie kind of way, but that’s about it. Cookie-ish pale malt, not really very wheaty to be honest, and no yeast character that makes a hefe truly a hefe. This is just a wheat beer, and a pretty lackluster one at that.

Mudshark Up River Lager;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mudshark Brewing Company;Surprisingly light for a craft beer, white head, looks almost like any mainstream light beer except maybe thicker foam. Grainy and malty with subtle bitter hops. The winning trait here is zero metallic, skunk or funk normally found in big brewers' light beers. Not a lot of craft drinkers are going to love this, but Lake Havasu City gets above 115 degrees frequently in summer, and if you are out on the water, as the name implies, it's hard to drink anything but a light beer like this, and its nice to have one available without turning to Golden or St. Louis. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Streets of New York Pilsner;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Streets of New York Brewery;Small 2 ounce sample at the brewpub--see my place rating for you to realize why. Fruity, floral, citric hops in the nose. Smells more like American hops than European hops. Pale blonde body with absolutely no head. ’Nuff said. Floral, herbal hoppiness to start with mild roastiness and mild dry bitter hops (saaz?). Light on the palate. Underly flavorable. This beer is just a mess.
Streets of New York Pilsner;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Streets of New York Brewery;This beer is a brilliantly clear, straw-gold color. It is topped by a pale, wispy white head. The aroma has a spicy hop note up front with hints of herbs and lemon. The taste is dry and spicy up front and is quite light on the palate. The finish has a nice dry, sharp bitterness to it. I taste notes of lightly toasted grain, spicy hops, and a woody herbal note. This is a decent Pilsner, not much oomph to it, but it is easily quaffable and refreshing. All flavors are equally evident and in a comparative balance to one another.

Streets of New York Russian Imperial Stout;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Streets of New York Brewery;Draft (nitro): Prune with crimson highlights. Creamy beige foam quickly dies. Weak aroma of medicine, show polish, cocoa, and red grapes. Grainy texture and watery. Onset of soured fruit acidity and vinegar smothers the potential malt richness that wishes to permeate. Dash of mocha and caramel provides brief sweetness followed by some smoky phenolics, but the proceeding sips are challenging, showing nothing but harsh acidity and minerally grit, which worsens the acidity and overemphasizes the firm black malt bite. Does soften a bit toward the muted finish, but not nearly enough as waxed red grapes continue to stifle the chocolaty richness, displaying a muted blend of caramel, vanilla, and a mere suggestion of bittersweet chocolate. Not that this ever showed an ounce of potential, but the fact that it was served to me ice-cold in a tall/nose-inhibiting glass, and, of all things…on nitro!! Good grief this is abysmal stuff.

Leek Strawberry Sunset;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);"Criminally overpriced bottle from Fosse Asda. Sounds more like a shade of Dulux. This bottle is actually just ’Leek Strawberry’. Burnished with some floaties at the bottom of the bottle and a fine white slick. Smells like a strawberry mini milk lolly; lactic, sweetened, a bit synthetic, with lightly dung-spattered, yoghurty edges. Synthetic strawberry taste with hints of lime creams. Quite a nasty fake sweetener aftertaste- just a crumb of beer-related malt huskiness. Drinkable, and no worse than the majority of fruit juice and sweetener-ladled beerpops of Belgium."

New Albanian Turbo Hog;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Malt Liquor;New Albanian Brewing Company;On tap at GTMW 2012 This was billed as a malt liquor in the GTMW program. Given the way the people were pouring it I think the goal was the same as with any malt liquor - get hammered as soon as possible. I worked my way through a few sips but it was too heavy to tackle more than about two ounces before moving on to the next booth. Aroma / Appearance - The creamy and cloudy orange base was murky. The nose was both sweet and boozy. For a malt liquor it was actually kind of complex. Instead of pure ethanol the hops had a chance to compete for attention. Flavor / Palate - The first sip was completely different. Pure ethanol hit the palate hard and with a mission. Sticking with a mildly cloying nature it stripped away any remnants of previous samples. It might be a good example of the style but there is a reason I have only rated a handful.

Toasty malt and honey aroma and flavour. Sweet, but not overly sweet with nice subtle genuine honey flavour balanced by yummy toastiness.

Old Credit Holiday Honey;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Old Credit Brewing;Dark amber colour, no head to speak of. Aroma is not very pronounced, and undistinguished, bit of malt and honey. Flavour is sweetish with malt and a tangy sort of aftertaste and finish that I attributed to the honey but I am not really sure. Pleasant but unexceptional.
Old Credit Holiday Honey;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Old Credit Brewing;Pours a bubbly copper-ruby with thin, dissipating head. Aromas of honey - a very floral honey at that.

Broken Tooth Alpenglow Amber;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Broken Tooth Brewing Company;Poured into a nonic pint glass, the appearance was an amber color with a sly finger’s worth of white foamy head. Clingy messy lace. The aroma had a light roastiness with some piney hops and a firm caramel malt backbone. Light cracker and biscuits. The flavor was sweet with the malt bill up front, cracker and caramel fully there. Malts linger into the aftertaste and into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Good carbonation and the ABV felt good. Overall, good amber ale worthy of having again.

This brew poured a large head of foamy finely sized luight brown colored long lasting bubbles that left behind a poor lace and a transparent light brown colored uncarbonated body. The aroma was mild and lightly hopped and the mouthfeel was initially smooth with a caramel malt hop finish with a slight tingle. It had a mild caramel malt hop flavor.
Tampa Bay Stobers Wedding Celebration Ale;Tampa, Florida, United States;IPA;Tampa Bay Brewing Co.;Around the same as the elephant ipa. It reminded me a lot of the SN cleebration ale, probably because of the title, but didnt live up to the assertiveness. It was good, pretty standard IPA. Solid beer from this place i have to admit.
Tampa Bay Stobers Wedding Celebration Ale;Tampa, Florida, United States;IPA;Tampa Bay Brewing Co.;Draft at Tampa Ba Brewing. A small sized off-white head with fine-small sized bubbles that mostly dissipated. The body was uncarbonated and transparent with an orange hue. The nose was moderately hoppy with a bitter and hoppy aftertaste. The palate was hoppy and this was a light bodied beer in my opinion with excellent lacing.

This draft brew was sampled at the brewery in Tampa Florida and was served to us by Jim McCann the brewer and Vicky Owen the owner. This brew poured a small head of foamy finely sized mostly lasting bubbles that left behind an uncarbonated transparent golden brown colored body and a good lacing. The aroma was very mild and malty if anything at all. The mouthfeel was smooth with a mild hop bite in the finish. It also had a medium strength hop flavor that was evry full-bodied and lingered well into the hoppy finish.
Green Flash Anniversary Strong Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Green Flash Brewing Company;June 19th, 2013 - Green Flash’s American Strong Ale is less a burly, red, crimson ale and more of a sweet and strawberry scented sipper. The nose gets some spice with cinnamon and caramel, but the flavor is shockingly sweet, leading the charge with basketfuls of strawberries and cherries. The palate is medium weight and medium carbonated, which attenuates some of the sugar shock a little but, but this syrupy colored brew is definitely a surprisingly sweet drink.

Green Flash Anniversary Strong Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Green Flash Brewing Company;Sample at Belmont Station. Pours a dark brownish-amber color with a medium foamy light beige head that diminishes steadily. Partial rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of malt, vanilla and hops.

Rogue Brewer;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Rogue Ales;Draft at the 2006 Washington Cask Beer Festival. First Black IPA I ever had I’m almost positive (besides maybe Stone’s Self-Righteous back then). Remember smelling that beautiful mixture of sweet roast, burnt milk, and piney hop goodness. Was a bit flat of course being on cask, but still stood out that night.
Rogue Brewer;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Rogue Ales;A very strong, and great tasting Black IPA. Rogue really does an excellent job with every beer they make. They are quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries ever.
Rogue Brewer;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Rogue Ales;Rated on 7-19-2008 (Flip-top bottle) This beer forms a medium sized beige head with a short retention, hazy reddish brown body, good amount of lacing, and fast rising carbonation. The Aroma is chocolate malt, sweet and very hoppy. The Taste is chocolate malt, alcohol, hops, and harsh tasting. This beer has a short dry finish. The Palate is tingly and this beer is medium bodied. Overall, this is a beer that I cannot drink a lot of at any one time due to the somewhat harsh taste. I do recommend trying it.
Rogue Brewer;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Rogue Ales;"Rogue Ales - Brewer’s on the Bay. From notes. A winter warmer strong ale. Hopped over the top! (106.9 IBU).

Rogue Brewer;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Rogue Ales;THIS IS IN THE COMMEMORATIVE, SWING-TOP BOTTLE. 2008. STRONG ALE... NOT BLACK IPA. Drank to honor the passing of my own dog. R.I.P, Jet (2/18/2001-9/17/2011). Dark, opaque and caramel. Toffee, raisins and plum in the nose. Dark sugar and dark fruit. Substantial mouthfeel.More caramel, toffee and black (?) coffee. Slight bitter finish with residual sweetnesson lips. Something mildly stout-like. A little nutty. Paired with Port Chester and Hudson Red Cheese from American Cheese in West Sayville, NY.
Rogue Brewer;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Rogue Ales;Hops and chocolate aroma, dark brown, off white head. Tastes of hops, malt and chocolate. Good balance, medium bodied, bitter and crisp. Beginning is malty , middle is more on the chocolate, finishes orange, earthy and bitter. Tasty beer, would drink again.
Rogue Brewer;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Rogue Ales;Don’t know what happened to my review...a 2 year old bottle consumed about 2 months ago. Kind of resembles an American Strong Ale or Barley Wine more than a Black IPA at this point. There’s a lingering pine hop quality to it but it mostly sits against a background of sweet caramel malts. This was pretty good and actually much better than the Old Crusty that I had recently which was of similar age.
Rogue Brewer;Newport, Oregon, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Rogue Ales;Pours dark brown with a tan head. Smells of caramel, resiny, earthy. Tastes bitter and caramelly with some sweet cloying notes on the finish.

Johansson's Heavy Hand Barleywine;Westminster, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Johansson's Dining House;Beer is a reddish color several shades lighter than one would expect of a barleywine. Aroma was sweet. Taste was pleasant and slightly fruity, but weak for a barleywine. All in all, a pretty decent imperial.
Johansson's Heavy Hand Barleywine;Westminster, Maryland, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Johansson's Dining House;A single-dimensional beer. More of an imperial IPA than a barleywine, with plenty of hops and alcohol nose, but lacking in the complexity expected of a barleywine.

Humpty Dumpty Little Sharpie;Reedham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Humpty Dumpty Brewery;Cask - The Wig & Pen, Norwich. A great bitter, this. Poured a clear golden amber with a lasting, lacing frothy white head. Archetypal bitter characteristics across the board but with a great house yeast complexity that made it for me. Light to medium body, soft on the palate with a medium length and intensity finish. Not high impact but when good condition, this is the sort of beer I could easily session time and time again.
Humpty Dumpty Little Sharpie;Reedham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Humpty Dumpty Brewery;Clear yellow, sweet citrus flavour. Flavour follows suit, a bit of hop and some sourness but it’s a touch sickly to be properly drinkable.
DB Export Super Dry;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Bottle in Sydney. Backlog rating from bottle collection and historic scoring. No tasting notes kept, just rating.
DB Export Super Dry;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);OLD NOTES AUG 9, 2004 An ’import’ you can get over here. Reminds me a bit of Tooheys Extra Dry, not that that’s a good thing. Dry light malt flavour, goes down like water, a bit skunkish when it gets warm.
DB Export Super Dry;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Bottled. Pale golden colour, moderate head and few honey notes. Fairly dry finish, but not so much as Toohey’s Extra Dry or Carlton Dry - a tad sweeter too, and much less (though still some) wet carboard action.
DB Export Super Dry;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);"Pale golden, clear, medium head. I wouldn’t go so far as calling this ""foul"", but it is pretty boring-- the same as all corn-adjunct, over-processed pale lagers on the market, only with the edition of a very dry finish. I wouldn’t choose to drink it again if an alternative were available, but I wouldn’t turn it down if the beerfridge was empty on a Friday night. This is my standard review for all ""two-star-or-less"" piss."
DB Export Super Dry;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Clear golden colour with a compact white mainly lasting head. Light doughy malt aroma. Bland taste, dry, malt and not much else.
DB Export Super Dry;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Geez this is dry. Would strip paint. Sucks in your face with each gulp. Not much else though/
DB Export Super Dry;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;DB Breweries (Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);Typical lager colour with almost no head that disappears quickly. Flavour starts awfully sweet (corn?). Finish is not particularly dry and has negligible bitterness. Well, you just have to rate everything that's new.
Starr Hill Big Daddy Old Ale;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Old Ale;Starr Hill Brewery;Cask. Very dark red, almost to stout level, with a surprisingly lively head for a cask beer. Aroma faintly of malt. Malty flavors, subtle, balanced. Notes of molasses, toffee, cocoa, and at the end a very faint roastiness. Beautifully done. I hadn't had a beer that surprised me in quite some time, and this one really made me take notice. Some could complaint that the medium body is too light for an old ale, but I thought it worked perfectly for the approach the brewer took.
Starr Hill Big Daddy Old Ale;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Old Ale;Starr Hill Brewery;Dark, deep red. Nose is restrained, some caramel, quite malty, some chocolate. Very malty flavor, lots of toffee, cocoa sweetness. Bit of scotchiness. Finishes dry and strong. Nice palate, smooth and creamy.
Starr Hill Big Daddy Old Ale;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Old Ale;Starr Hill Brewery;Dark brown body with a creamy tan head. Big lucious chocolate aroma. The flavor lives up to the stage set by the aroma, tons of malty rich caramel and choclate flavors. A decent amount of roasted flavor settles in about midway through. The aftertaste is more sweetness leaning towards a candy flavor. Body is creamy and full. Very nice beer overall. The brewer is quite the character to boot.
Starr Hill Big Daddy Old Ale;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Old Ale;Starr Hill Brewery;Dark brown with creamy beige head, nice lacing. Aroma is rich chocolate, some scotch. Taste is a big malt daddy -- caramel, scotch, chocolate, some maple, butter. Medium-full body.
Shenandoah Robust Rye Porter;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Porter;Shenandoah Brewing Company;This bottle came out of a sampler 6pk and was only identified on the label as a porter, not as a ’robust rye porter’. And since there is nothing else listed, either here or on the Shenandoah website, here I shall rate. Cap nearly blew off, there was so much pressure. The head, tan and rocky, took forever to settle. Cardboard aroma, thin mouthfeel, taste was rather flavorless, metallic finish, way too much carbonation. Not far removed from a drainpour.
Shenandoah Robust Rye Porter;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Porter;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Probably the worst Porter I have ever had. Deep, dark pour with a thin head. Roasty aroma. Some kind of chocolate I believe. But very bad taste. Could be a bad bottle or batch, but it was rancid. Just like jmuhops says, an insult to the palate.
Shenandoah Robust Rye Porter;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Porter;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Pours black with ruby edges and a smallish head with large bubbles. Roasty aroma--I swear I smell something akin to Natty Light in there, too. First sip is an assault on the tongue and an insult to the palate--like rancid milk. It calms down after that into what may be considered a mildly enjoyable brew. Mouthfeel is spot on, for what it’s worth.
Shenandoah Robust Rye Porter;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Porter;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Dark, nose is smoky, some tobacco. Lots of woody smokiness in the flavor, excellent roasts follow up and finishes with a lovely sweetness. Some darn good stuff, one of the better porters I've had.
Shenandoah Robust Rye Porter;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Porter;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Dark opaque body. The head is creamy and tan. Sweet chocolate aroma. The flavor is more complex, choclate, a hint of sourness, rye, bitter roasted malt, slightly smoky, and biscuit. Medium full body with a medium dry finish from the rye. An outstanding porter.
Shenandoah Robust Rye Porter;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Porter;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Dark brown with creamy beige head. Aroma is mild sweet, some sour milk. Taste is chocolate, some rye, some roasty/smoky. Medium-full body.

Moon River Moon Dance Pale Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Moon River Brewing Company;draught at the brew pub. Copper with moderate head but a lot of nice lace. Faint hops/malt aroma. Flavor of biscuit malt with lovely hops finish. True to style.
Moon River Moon Dance Pale Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Moon River Brewing Company;2005 GCBC. Nitro. Copper gold pour with creamy dense nitro head. light caramel malty aromas with some earthy woody hops in it. Similar flavors, with some citrusy lemon notes. Decent.
Moon River Moon Dance Pale Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Moon River Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub in Savannah, Ga. Pours a pleasant dark orange with a creamy, soft white head and decent lacing. Sweet, clean, floral and fruity aroma. Flavor has a delicate, sublte bitterness that at first blush is peppery - but mellows off to a very soft citrusy sweetness - not grapefruity though. Good example of the English Pale Ale Style. Mouthfeel is thick enough and it finisihes strong. Excellent session material.
Moon River Moon Dance Pale Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Moon River Brewing Company;2005 GCBC. Nitro pour with a nice cascade effect. Hazy amber color and off-white head. Dirty-earthy hop aroma with caramel underneath. Little hop and little malt leaving little to the flavor.
Moon River Moon Dance Pale Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Moon River Brewing Company;Sampled at GCBC 2005. Pours dark orangish with a typical nitro foamy off-white head. Aroma is quite good for a nitro pour with flowery, spicy Golding hops. Taste is almost all hops, with a little crystal malt for balance. Mouthfeel thin-bodied with smooth carbonation. Still, tastes a bit raw and grainy. Not a big fan of this.
Moon River Moon Dance Pale Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Moon River Brewing Company;This was nitro conditioned but dispensed in plain CO2 at the Georgia Craft Brew Challenge. Had the appearance and flavors effects of typical nitro dispensed beers. That being, said, this was quite the impressive pale ale. Slightly hazed copper, perfect creamy, cream-colored head. Really neat cascading from the nitrogen as well. The aroma is nice with a very bright mandarin orange hop aroma. The nitro dulled the flavor and I think I’d prefer the beer on cask or just from a normal tap, but this is a solid beer nonetheless.
Moon River Moon Dance Pale Ale;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Moon River Brewing Company;Draft, shaker. Clear, medium tan-amber hue with a small, frothy white head. Huge assault of floral (to the point of almost being citric) hops. Lightly caramel and toasted white bread malt. Simple and straight forward but pleasing in its cleanliness. Moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter flavor. Lighty sweet, moderately bitter finish. Very clean flavor as well. Medium body, water (almost creamy) texture, moderate carbonation.
Moon River Mai-bock;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Moon River Brewing Company;Some things never cease to amaze me. This maibock incarnation has a pale golden peach hue with sparkling carbonation and a frothy, white draft head. A leafy green salad is placed in front of me. Plum and mango chunks give the salad heft. Walnut crumbles are sprinkled about for texture. A drizzling of peppered extra virgin olive oil brings it all together. Entirely true to the aroma, spicy fruitiness abounds. Acidity is soft allowing the lavishly creamy sweet flavors to take lead during the entire experience. Oily, yet slick, this beer glides effortlessly with the perfect touch carbonation. 12 oz shaker, draft.
Platek American Pale Ale;Richmond, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;J.W. Platek Brewing Company;"On tap. Pours a cloudy and lovely caramel-amber. Big puffy white head forms on pour and proves to have good staying power, leaving big clumps of lace on the inside of the glass with each gulp. Aroma is a bit faint but reveals sweet malt and piney, citrusy hops that combine to simulate bitter orange. Flavor is similar, with a dry bitter hop kick starting things off; then the sweet malt and citrus come online to temper the bitterness a bit. While there is a definite hop presence, this is not an ambitiously bitter beer. Finishes with a solid mouthfeel and medium-thick palate and a pleasant dry citrus aftertaste. Too many breweries overkill this style; I prefer a more subtle approach and Platek delivers without being watery or boring. Well done."
Platek American Pale Ale;Richmond, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;J.W. Platek Brewing Company;This beer was a dark yellow, with a quickly dissipating head. A fairly thin malt was detected that was adequate, but it was upstaged by the grassy hop rush. A little off balance, but drinkable.
Platek DunkelWeizen;Richmond, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;J.W. Platek Brewing Company;Arrives dark caramel brown and murky looking with a thick white head and very foamy and served with a lemon garnish. Aroma has a definite wheat presence with a lot of banana and also heavy of clove. Flavor is very strong of banana up front moving into a clove spiciness which carries throughout the rest of the tasting. Lemon garnish does add a bit of a citrus flavor to it. Beer is thicker and carries a very unique ending of a thick lemon spice taste and citrus feeling. Overall a very well done dunkel.
Platek Belgian Strong Ale;Richmond, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;J.W. Platek Brewing Company;On tap. Pours a murky deep amber with bubbly white head that leaves decent lacing with each sip. Aroma is of clove, banana, a bit of citrus, rich sugary malt and grassy, clover-y hops. Flavor is heavy on the banana and clove which combine to produce a sort of bubble-gum flavor that is fairly common to the style. Grassy hops, rich sugary malt and light lemony citrus show up as well, and a dose of alcohol keeps it all nice and toasty. Tingly palate as it slides down the back of the throat with ease. Best beer in the house, narrowly edging out the pale ale.
Platek Brown Ale;Richmond, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;J.W. Platek Brewing Company;Had this from the tap. Arrived a dark brown color with a thick semi-heavy head with a slight cloudy look to it and a low/med carbonation. Aroma is very light caramel malt with some grapefruit citrus too it. Pretty pronounced grapefruit citrus up front with some grassy hops flavor mixing with the light caramel malt presence. This had no really distinct flavor to it other than the grapefruit and was missing the nutty tones usually found in this style. Overall a beer to only try once as there is not much there to enjoy.
Platek Brown Ale;Richmond, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;J.W. Platek Brewing Company;On tap. Pours a nearly opaque chestnut-brown with hints of red on the edges. Thinnish mocha-colored head forms on pour and fairly quickly settles to a whispe and a ring, the latter of which leaves nice bits of lace as the glass empties. Aroma reveals a surprisingly sweet malt profile with dried grain and medium hop bitterness also showing. Flavor also showed a sweet touch with caramel, toffee molasses and a dash of dried cherries tempering the otherwise toasty dryness and moderate hop bitterness. Medium mouthfeel with a slightly thin palate, especially for a beer with such a sweet flavor profile. Quite a charming little brown.
Platek Brown Ale;Richmond, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;J.W. Platek Brewing Company;This one had little head and was the expected near opaque color. The aroma was of slight caramel and peat, with a taste of malt to match. The malt was consistent throughout, with just enough bittering hops to keep it from being unbalanced. Not a real exciting brew.
Platek Stout;Richmond, Illinois, United States;Stout;J.W. Platek Brewing Company;Poured from my growler a very dark brown/black color with thick tan head. Aroma is strong and mixed with chocolate, toffee, caramel and coffee. Beer’s aroma is awesome. Flavor starts off with a lot of roasted malt notes, quickly moving into a light chocolate sweetness and coffee bitterness, some dark fruit presence and quite a sweet syrup flavor at the end (warming only brings this out more). Overall the aroma of the beer is the best part and the body of the beer does require a bit more but not a bad beer at all.
Platek Stout;Richmond, Illinois, United States;Stout;J.W. Platek Brewing Company;On tap. Pours a respectably opaque chestnut-brown-black with a thin bubbly head that leaves modest lacing. One consistent feature of this establishment’s beers is a subdued aroma, and here we have no exception. A deep inhale finally reveals roast-grain bitterness, a touch of malt sweetness and not much else. The flavor proves to be considerably more complex, featuring the requisite roast-grain dry bitterness, a judicious dose of semi-sweet chocolate malt, a hint of molasses, earthy hops, and a wholesome, lightly sweet crunchy/earthy/grainy quality. Definitely leans more toward the sweet than dry end of the spectrum for a stout -- if someone told me this is an oatmeal stout, I’d believe ’’em. Palate is tingly but a little on the thin side. If I had to rate this beer on flavor alone, it would have received a substantially higher score.
Platek Stout;Richmond, Illinois, United States;Stout;J.W. Platek Brewing Company;This one had no head as expected and was opaquely black. The aroma was of licorice and coffee. The taste was a wonderful surprise of an initial malt balance of roast malt, slight bread, slight licorice, and a hint of coffee. Hops were not noticable as expected. This is how I like stout to be. Others might like another blend.
Murauer Bock;Murau, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Murau;Tap. Amber with a low off-white head. Faint raisin, artificial caramel, light corn syrup.

Malty aroma, with some sweet caramel notes present, some grains. Taste is quite sweet and malty, very mild grassy notes and mild bitterness. Light, but a bit too sweet. Some alcohol also detectable, not too pleasant.

OKish, the corn notes on the smell are kinda weird, taste is rather sweet and overall boring.
Murauer Bock;Murau, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Murau;Bottle 10 month after BB. Golden body with white head. Aroma is not really strong some caramel. Taste is also not very strong maybe some biscuits and some grains. Aftertaste is boring with some metallic taste.

Ottakringer Dunkles;Wien, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Ottakringer;Dieses Bier wurde aus dem Portfolio genommen, um dem Goldfassl Dunkel Platz zu machen. Bis es 2019 wieder ohne den Goldfassl-Zusatz geliefert wurde. Es ist im großen und ganzen gleich geblieben. Es kommt mir etwas sanfter und süffiger vor als das Goldfassl Dunkel, das ist aber sehr subjektiv.

Ottakringer Dunkles;Wien, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Ottakringer;Geschmacklich total interessant. Der Antrunk ist süffig-malzig-säuerlich. Im Hauptteil wird es vollmundig-malzig mit vielen schönen Röstmalzaromen. Der Nachgeschmack ist wie stark gebackene Brotkruste - langanhaltend und stark röstmalzig. Dabei behält es seinen leicht säuerlichen Unterton. Für meinen Geschmack ist es richtig schön rund - einfach ideal. Test vom 19.3.2008, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 12,14,14,15,12,14 - 13,85

Locher Naturperle;Appenzell, Switzerland;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Locher Appenzeller Bier;Ein klassisches Lager, das in die Richtung Zwickel geht, aber dafür doch zu herb ist. Dabei ist es sehr angenehm zu trinken, da es süffiger ist als das klassische Lager.
Locher Naturperle;Appenzell, Switzerland;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Locher Appenzeller Bier;Tap. Ah, a Keller of the rather bland type. The unfilteredness works, but it is a bit too much on the yeasty side. The yeast actually almost gives a Belgian touch to it. Not in harmony. Still okay, but nothing more.

Locher Naturperle;Appenzell, Switzerland;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Locher Appenzeller Bier;500ml bottle from Drinks of the World, Basel, Switzerland (3.00 CHF): This was something a little different from an ordinary pale lager with a fresh & yeasty taste complimented by some nice citrus flavours & a lot of malts. Very easy to drink, more so than I’d imagined & definitely a nice change up from what I’m used to. I wouldn’t mind having again but probably only if I find myself back in Switzerland at some point.

Blackwater IPA;Davis, West Virginia, United States;IPA;Blackwater Brewing Company;On draft at Blackwater Brewing Company. Poured clear, dark gold. Thin and lacking malts. Lacking the hop profile I was anticipating as well. Sessionable.
Blackwater IPA;Davis, West Virginia, United States;IPA;Blackwater Brewing Company;At first look it is not a great beer, it resembles some of those tasteless yellow lagers that I try to avoid. The first taste isn’t much better. But to be honest, it got better as I got closer to the bottom of the glass. Although not a great beer, I would recommend this beer above the others at this brewery.
Blackwater IPA;Davis, West Virginia, United States;IPA;Blackwater Brewing Company;On tap, from the source: Deep yellow color with minimal head. Medium malts and virtualy no hops. Not much I in this PA. Not much PA either. Carbonation is low. Flavor is a bit bitter but later developes. Like all the beers I’ve tried from Blackwater Brewing Co., the first sip taste really off, but for some crazy reason by mid-glass it tastes quite good and begins to fit the style. Regardless, I find this to be on the low end of IPA’s.

Pours a clear amber color with a small white head. The aroma has mild sweetness, caramel, light fruits and some earthy notes.

Taste is caramel malt with medium hop bittering in a nice balance - it seems to me that it could qualify as a small IPA. A good drinking brew, easily North End’s best offering. Well done.
North End Roedys Red;Parkersburg, West Virginia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;North End Tavern & Brewery;Approximately 3 ounce sample pour (in a plastic oversized shot glass) at the brewpub in Parkersburg, West Virginia. The pour is a light haze golden ruby with a small off white head. The aroma is caramel malt, lightly sweet and delicate floral hops. The taste is nice, the malt is caramel, naturally sweet, and the transition to the floral hops is smooth. The hops carry the finish, drying it out nicely. The palate is medium bodied, with a nice carbonation level and the clean dry finish. Nice one, certainly my favorite beer I tried at North End.

John O Gaunt Duke of Lancaster;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John O Gaunt;Bottle Conditioned. Bought in Bottles, London. Best Before Feb 2004. A light brown with a slight haze and some fine bubbles rising. Some yeast went into the pour. Pleasant woody malt aroma with a touch of brown sugar. Thinnish body with some harshness. Doesn't call attention to itself. Rest of the yeast tipped in. Some fruit flavours come through, slightly on the citric side. There's not a lot happening here, and the thin, slightly harsh mouthfeel is not endearing. A poor effort really.

Great Dane Octoppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at Downtown location. Pours a deep bronze with offwhite head. Nose is somewhat sweet and caramely, some light hop notes. Taste is pretty much as advertised, a mix of toasty Marzen & robust and sweet dopelbock. A bit on the hoppy side for style as well. Alcohol comes through but isn’t too overwhelming. An interesting beer for sure.
Great Dane Octoppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;(Tap) Pours a clear amber with little head. Interesting beer, but it seemed like there was too much going on to get a good feel for the beer in the sampler that I tried. Some muddled caramel/spice notes are there at the beginning. The one thing that was prevalent in the brew was the alcohol. The alcohol is not disguised at all. It actually tasted like the ABV is closer to 12-15%. This is nice and warming, but overwhelming given the fact there is no real direction in the beer.
Great Dane Octoppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Poured a clear medium orange with a creamy beige head. Fairly nice lacing. Aroma of rich caramel malts, fall-type spices, and some noble hoppage. Caramel was more predominant as this warmed. Flavor was similar to the aroma at first, but the balance was out-of-whack about halfway through, and a lot of weirdness came through... alcohol and some barnyard elements showed up, and the finish got a bit too much of the booze factor (along with nice spices and sweet caramel). Started out smooth on the palate, and kind of blew up and lost its balance at the end. Pretty good, with some definite rough edges.
Great Dane Octoppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap now. The beer pours to a clean orange/amber body with a thick orangish head that disapates to a thin, lasting film. The flavor is strange but good. I may be crazy, but this is what I got from this beer: pumpkin, toasted grain, almost a train-wreck of a beer. Vienna malts? Bock components. Pumpkin bread, butter, and barleywine. Hay. The flavor has some characteristics of a Biere de Garde. The aroma is light and hard to determine. I rarely get a strong aroma from their beers. Points docked for that. The palate has a lingering feel. Lively carbonation. Light creamyness and grainy. This was one confusing beer.
Great Dane Octoppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"Tap at downtown location. Very pretty golden orange color; a slight but pervasive head. Big aromatic caramel/honey aroma. Taste is hop bitter at first, then fast warming from alcohol and a long malt finish. Alcohol is too high for any appreciable mouthfeel. Very dry compared to Capital’s Autumnal Fire (the only other like style I’ve had)."
Great Dane Octoppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;At the brewery. A nice turn on their octoberfest. Clear medium honey color, light head. Sweet caramel flavor with nice alcohol punch. Very good overall.
Great Dane Octoppelbock;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Tap @ Benno's -West Allis, WI. Clear dark amber with a dense off white head. Heavy malt and alcohol aromas. Flavors match aromas. Nice caramel and malt flavors , but the alcohol kicks in fast, hard and warming. A decent warming brew but lacks balance.
Hoppers Royal Bohemian Pilsner;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Solid beer with very good balance between hops and malts.

Hoppers Royal Bohemian Pilsner;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;While not a huge pils fan, it’s easy to see why this one is a crowd fav.

Hoppers Royal Bohemian Pilsner;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Draft - beautiful beer, nice creamy white head.

Perfect beer to be drinking on a nice hot Florida day.
Hoppers Royal Bohemian Pilsner;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;. I’ll start by saying that Lagers have never been my thing. Hazed golden yellow, creamy white head. Nose was a bit bready, sweet honey like, dirty, with maybe a hint of earthiness. Balanced, but nothing standing out but maybe some sweetness. Medium bodied, fizzy carbonation, sweet honeyish finish. Go for it though if your a Pils fan......
Hoppers Royal Bohemian Pilsner;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Draft at the Linebaugh location... Lightly hazy, yellow lager with a small, creamy, white head. Smells like sweat and clover honey. The flavor is balanced well , but kind of funky. Canned corn. First sweet, then bitter, then sweet again. Medium-bodied and creamy with lively carbonation. Lengthy, bitter, but mostly sweet finish. Left my palate with a weird, lightly sweet, corny glaze. Not my thing, but neither is the style.

Hoppers Tampa Red;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;"Draft... Deep, clear amber ale with a small white head. The floral, malty nose is full of caramel, butter and toffee. Balanced by just the right amount of hops to keep it clean and not cloyingly sweet. Medium-bodied and creamy with fizzy carbonation. Finishes a touch sweet and a touch dry. A great ""session beer"" that doesn’t taste like a ""session beer."" Great stuff!"

They did better this time...hops are definitely in this aroma...piney and citric. Flavor is more of the same, not very complex, but still tasty. Medium bodied...bitter in the end. Not bad.
Hoppers Phat Cat IPA;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;IPA;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;TheDM and Hotstuff vacation brew 100. This draft brew was sampled at the East Lake Road Hoppers Tampa Florida. This brew poured a small head of finely sized white colored long lasting bubbles that left behind a good lacing and a hazy yellow colored uncarbonated body. Thea roma was odd for an IPA, there was none???? It had a flat mouthfeel with no bite no flavor and was just plain off. I noted that it was not a good example of an IPA and definately not per style.
Hoppers Fischers Hefe-Weizen;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Pours a cloudy hefe-yellow with a big fluffy white head. It looks the part. Aroma is some clovy spice, light fruits...banana I suppose. Flavor is decent, not up to the promises of the nose, but ok nonetheless. Flavor is light...some maltiness, a little hops, a definite yeastiness, but comes up short of being great on all counts. A nice hefe, a little too thin, and not up there with the best. I’d still order it again.
Hoppers Fischers Hefe-Weizen;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;I still dig a good Hefe every now and then. Draft - Very hazy gold, fluffy white head. Nose was light clove and banana, but with more bubblegum and lemon type notes dominating. The flavor somewhat mirrored the aroma with decent balance and touch of sweetness. Needed more of the typical German yeast character profile for me to love it. Medium bodied, fizzy carbonation, smooth lightly spiced finish. Still a nice session ale on a sunny warm day...
Hoppers Fischers Hefe-Weizen;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;"Draft at the Linebaugh location... Murky, light yellow ale with a small, creamy, white head. Great retention and ink-blot, cement-like lacing. The aroma is of sweat and leather; none of the traditional fruit and spices of a hefe-weizen. The fruit and spices do show up in the flavor, though. A hint of banana and a whisper of clove. It’s a bit on the sweet side for my taste. Medium-bodied and silky with moderate carbonation. Short, lightly sweet, spicy finish."
Hoppers Fischers Hefe-Weizen;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Draft at Hoppers in Tampa, FL. A large sized white head that was creamy and smooth with fine sized bubbles that were long lasting. The body was cloudy with a lot of fast rising carbonation and a yellow hue. The nose was that of banana and clove with a sweet and banana taste. The mouthfeel was smooth, watery and thin making this a light bodied German Hefeweizen with sparse lacing.

This draft brew was sampled at the East Lake Road Hoppers Tampa Florida.

Hoppers Helms Dunkler Bock;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;On tap...pours hazy brown, small whitish head. Malts in your nose, eyes, ears.....etc. Flavor is malty too...not much else going on. Yep, some hops in the balancing act, but they don’t get along very well. Probably my least favorite.
Hoppers Helms Dunkler Bock;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Odd (dopple?) bock. It was dark brown with a white head. Malty, but too much hops for the style. The malts lacked a certain kick (roastyness?) I expect in the dopplebocks. Wasn’t bad, though.
Hoppers Helms Dunkler Bock;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Draft at Hoppers in Tampa, FL. The taste of this beer was off for the style. The head was small and ivory with fine sized bubbles that quickly dissipated. The body was uncarbonated and somewhat murky with a brown hue. The nose was very malty and the flavor was malty as well, but something just wasn't right with the flavoring. The mouthfeel was smooth and this was a light-medium bodied beer with sparse lacing.

This draft brew was sampled at the East Lake Road Hoppers Tampa Florida. This brew poured a small head of off-white colored finely sized bubbles that left behind a hazy brown colored body with no visible carbonation and a fair lace. The aroma was nice with strong matly notes and the mouthfeel was tingly bubbly and smooth with a lingering bubbly feeling. It had a brown malt flavor that was different from other bocks I have had. It was bolder and hoppier with a weird hard to call flavor.
Hoppers Donner Pale Ale;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Draft at Hoppers in Tampa, FL. A medium sized white head that was creamy and smooth and contained fine-small sized bubbles that quickly dissipated. The body was softly carbonated and transparent with a yellow hue.

Hoppers Flying Gator Ale;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Strong Ale - English;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Draft...This beer rocks!... Crystal clear copper ale with a small, creamy, off-white head. Terrific retention. The aroma is mostly of sweat and malt. It’s also vineous and caramelly. Very malty-sweet flavor, but not cloyingly so. Lots of other cool flavors... toffee, brown sugar and caramel popcorn with a whisper of milk chocolate. Full-bodied and ultra creamy with lively carbonation. Lengthy, malty-sweet finish. World class brew!
Hoppers Flying Gator Ale;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Strong Ale - English;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;I had this the other night and it is basically a different beer than it used to be. Much bigger beer with more malt and hop presence and a nice flavor range that reminds me of some of a big west coast version of an English ale.
Hoppers Flying Gator Ale;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Strong Ale - English;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;"On tap...strange, I’ve got some friends who love this stuff. I’m not getting it. What I had last week wasn’t as weak as the samples tried by hotstuff and thedm, but I’d have to agree with their assessment of the ""taste loss"". This beer fought the battle but lost. Color is ok, translucent yellow-brownish...could be dishwater hued. Mouthfeel was ok too, but the flavor/aromas were just too hard to find let alone enjoy. Some malts, but that’s about it. I’d be interested to hear what others think."
Hoppers Flying Gator Ale;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Strong Ale - English;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Draft at Hoppers in Tampa, FL. I was not able to detect any aroma with this beer at all. Weird. It formed a large sized off-white head with fine sized bubbles that quickly dissipated. The body was uncarbonated and transparent with a yellow-orange hue. The flavor was malty and some caramel notes. The mouthfeel was fairly smooth and this was a medium bodied beer with a fair amount of lacing.

Maine Coast Jordan Pond IPA;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;IPA;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;On tap in Jack Russells Brewpub. Light copper colour with a frothy head. Good hoppy aroma, possibly a little floral. flavour has a nice bitter hop to it. Crisp finish. lovely.
Maine Coast Jordan Pond IPA;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;IPA;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;"Any first impressions? -A sheet of foam is worried by the heavily-sedimented dull orange it is supposed to reign upon. -A wooden, citrusy C-hop perfume soars, well-developed and appealing. -A resinous hop flavor sticks to the palate. -The sweet cereal offers but bloated maltiness, and the low carbonation cannot rouse any other flavors. What if you dig deeper? -Orangey fruitiness manages to diversify the flavor profile. -The tea-like, leafy hop bitterness is surprisingly restrained for the high level of hop flavor found. -The malty end of the flavor spectrum is rather narrow. -This is an okay IPA if you like relatively proud flavors, but one with construction weaknesses if you care to look for them. Bottle; no date."
Maine Coast Jordan Pond IPA;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;IPA;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Bottle exploded when i opened it-i assume this means too much sugar in the bottle? anyway, didnt get a chance to taste much as i lost more than half by opening (and it was in the cellar for a month) second best label ive ever seen (next to precipice pale ale) but from what i tasted of it, it was very metallic and not overly hoppy--really wanted something good out of this-hopefully they revise their methods by the time i go up there this summer
Maine Coast Jordan Pond IPA;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;IPA;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Pours a white, two-finger head that goes slowly and leaves some lace. Hazy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Starts and finishes hoppy, the hops are not overbearing but still a fairly typical IPA. $1.83 for a 12oz bottle from Maine Coast Brewery Bar Harbor, Me.
Maine Coast Jordan Pond IPA;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;IPA;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;The color an unclouded mahogany with a spumous light tan head that is portly in size, as it slow disappears into the sunset the lace forms a tight sealing sheet upon the glass. A tiny hint of the hop flower noted along with the sweet malt freshness that I find quite appealing, fresh, crisp and clean, start is lightly sweet, decently malted with a middling top. Finish is delicately acidic, the hops unassuming in their spiciness, once again a fine drinking beer that would make a great daily sample, a “Big Thang” in my book.
Ybor Gold Wheat Ale;Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Wheat Ale;Florida Beer Company;Entering in old ratings, poured a golden color, aromas of light wheat and bubble gum, flavors follow suit, ok wheat overall.
Ybor Gold Wheat Ale;Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Wheat Ale;Florida Beer Company;Bottle. Grainy sour tasting, with notes of burnt bread and faint hops. Blah
Ybor Gold Wheat Ale;Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Wheat Ale;Florida Beer Company;Gold pour with watery white head and lace. Wheat and sour malt on the nose. Wheaty perfume taste. Fizzy and a tad thin. Not much but drinkable.

Has an outstanding biscuit aroma. Very malty sweet with a good hop balance. It finishes bready and doughy. This is a very competent beer.
Ybor Gold Wheat Ale;Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States;Wheat Ale;Florida Beer Company;12oz bottle. Clear, deep yellow\gold color. Aroma of bananas. Flavor is way to light to really taste any thing. Boring.

Pours a light gold color with a white head. Aroma is light with wheat and hops. Taste is average, just another wheat beer that I still can’t find a taste for. Wheat is for bread.

Nose of skunky wheat, cereal grains and sweet malts. Flavor is very close to the aroma, more skunky wheat and sweet malts. Sticky mouthfeel, light bodied. Finish is very short and watery. Bleh.

Hoppers Wild Berry Lambic;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;The aroma is fruity and funky like a lambic should be. The appearance is red and tan with a thin head. The palate is smooth. Overall I like it. On draft at Lagerhaus Palm Harbor.
Hoppers Wild Berry Lambic;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Draft at Lagerhaus in Palm Harbor. Poured murky reddish brown in color with a thin ring of pink bubbles. Aroma is generally sweet with berries with no sign of wild yeasts. The taste is mostly of blueberries, raspberries, and pretty sweet. The high abv made this a slow drinker. The carbonation and probably the high abv was prickly on the tongue. They listed this at 14% on the menu and it certainly was warming. A fruit beer, yes. A lambic, no.
Hoppers Wild Berry Lambic;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;On tap at Lagerhause in Palm Harbor FL. Pours hazy brown with amber tint and initial weak off white to tan head that vanishes quickly. Strong aroma of multiple berry varieties like sweet blueberries, marionberries, and hints of tarter raspberries all mixed together. Also has a sugary sweet sense in the back of the aroma. The taste begins with a bit of a viscous mouth feel pulling in sweet and tart fruitiness and then it sort of evens out and blends together staying fruity sweet with raspberries, tarter raspberries, sweet blueberries and cut with more tart raspberries. It seem to dry out into the finish creating a refreshing taste. There is no sense of the ABV at all.
Hoppers Wild Berry Lambic;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Had this at the Oldsmar Lagerhaus. Talked with the brewer, he said this was brewed in October 2004. He also said this was almost 16%, which seems not to be the case. Pretty good beer, although it’s technically not a lambic I don’t think. Dark red pour, small off white head. No retention or lacing. Nose of assorted frozen berries, fruit jams and sugars. Flavor profile is raspberry, blueberry, strawberry and some balsamic vinegar. Too sweet in the end to be a lambic, probably should be a fruit beer. Medium bodied, very heavy on the palate and drinks quite nicely. Long finish, sweet berries and sugars.
Hoppers Wild Berry Lambic;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Doesn’t really taste like a Lambic to me. Tasted like a fizzy pale ale with fruit extracts in it. One of their least compelling offerings.
Hoppers Wild Berry Lambic;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Pours from the tap with a small white head on a light reddish ale. Nose is always a kicker...alcohol, red berries, citrusy hops, and just plain sweetness. Flavor follows suit, but more tart/sour than the aroma leads you to believe. Well carbonated, fruitiness (more berries and citrus overtones) are present toward the dry finish. Never had a lambic like this one. Tasty.
Hoppers Wild Berry Lambic;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Draft - another unique creation from crazy Franz. Vibrant red and pinkish shadow, whitish pink head. Nose of fresh rasberries, some cherry, small hint of alcohol. Flavor was pure berry with a small hint of citrus. Alcohol was mildy detectable. Overall a well, unique beer.
Hoppers Wild Berry Lambic;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Draft - Swampy reds and pinks, bubblegum pink fizzy head. Just an awesome nose of fresh berry, some earth, and a slight hint of alcohol. Flavor was berry-licious, tart, a touch of sweetness, with again only a hint of 11% ever noticed. This one will creep up on you quick. Medium bodied, fizzy carbonation, dry fruity finish. A well done brew by wacky guy Franz.
Hoppers Wild Berry Lambic;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;Draft at the Linebaugh location... This beer rocks!... Murky, strawberry-colored ale with a small, fizzy, white head. Decent retention and polka dot lacing. The aroma is woodsy with notes of sweat and strawberries. The flavor matches the aroma, but is very tart with a soft kiss of alcohol. Medium-bodied with lively carbonation. Lengthy, fruity, tart, dry finish. I’m surprised that this beer isn’t overly sweet with the high ABV. Very tart and tangy. Nice job Franz!
Hoppers Wild Berry Lambic;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;(Brooker Creek) Hazed Koolaid red body with white head. Aroma is sweet, berry, some alcohol.

Water Street Black Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Water Street Brewery;Keg at the Water Street location. Dark brown, thin tan head, poor retention. Aroma of roast and chocolate. Taste is roast, chocolate. Thin. This one had some promise.... Until I tasted it.
Water Street Black Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Water Street Brewery;Un-Muzzling Olde Muzzlehatch Ratings, #84. 20 ounce draught at the brewpub, August 2008. Not quite opaque jet with little head, mostly diminishing...nose grainy and light, with just a bit of dark roasted malts in evidence...unfortunately the body feels adjuncty, vegetal and is more reminiscent of a pale lager than anything else, though there is a bit of roasty bitterness at the finish that keeps it from total failure...also a bit thin. Not impressed. Also not sure why I only had the one beer on this my only visit to this brewpub, unless it was that it was smoky (ah, I remember the pre-smoking ban days...). That was likely it - that and, driving by myself, I wanted to save most of my drinking stamina for Delafield’s other, better brewpub.
Water Street Black Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Water Street Brewery;Tasted on tap at Water Street Brewery. Black color with a faint tan head. A nice malt aroma with a rich, smooth malty taste. A seasonal beer, and My favorite beer at this brewpub. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Water Street Black Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Water Street Brewery;Not that bad of a beer. Waaaay to chocolatey and roasty for the style, it is more of just an american brown lager or something stupid like that.
Water Street Black Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Water Street Brewery;Sampled on draught at the 2010 Wisconsin Craft Beer Festival in Chilton, WI. Pours a clear cola brown colored brew with an average sized off-white head that slowly dissipates to a thin ring and spotty lacing. Aroma of caramel and chocolate malt, a hint of coffee and a touch of leather. Taste is light to medium bodied with flavors of dark multi-grain malt, some grassy hops and a touch of roasted nuts. Finish is semi-dry, some metallic texture and then a roasted nutty aftertaste.
Water Street Black Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Water Street Brewery;On tap. Brownish amber color, flat with no head. Aroma is of sweet and toasted malts. Flavor is thin and overly caramel for the style. Light dry/bitter finish. Next...

Water Street Black Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Water Street Brewery;On tap at the Delafield location. Poured deep brown with a well-retained, creamy beige head. The aroma picked up soft chocolate and bready notes upfront with a little earth and faint floral hoppage around.. quite enjoyable. The flavor found toasty chocolate, coffee, and lesser molasses surrounded by earthy accents.. hints of smoke on the back.. tasty and well-balanced. Light-bodied with great use of malts in here.. higher carbonation moved it well across the palate.. dry and well-balanced. This was a great surprise!

Bayern Schwarzbier;Missoula, Montana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bayern Brewing;Draft. Nearly black. Soft lace. I can't find any aroma. Flavors are muted, but watery coffee is strongest.
Bayern Schwarzbier;Missoula, Montana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bayern Brewing;Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a very deep brown nearly black color with a tiny fizzy tan colored head. The head fades very fast leaving almost no lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is heaviest lightly toasted malt smell along with some cola and caramel smells. Along with these aromas are some lighter earthy and herbal smells, creating a decently roasty and somewhat sweeter smell overall. Taste – The taste begins with a rather sweeter flavor of some caramel and molasses as well as a little bit of a roasted malt flavor. The roasted flavors grow slightly more intense in nature as the taste advances to the middle with the caramel and molasses growing slightly stronger as well. At this point a little bit of a earthy and herbal hop taste work their way onto the tongue, leaving one with a moderately roasted and decently sweetened flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel- The body of the brew is on the thinner to medium side, with a carbonation level that is on the average to slightly lower side. For the lighter abv. and the sweeter tastes the feel is quite nice, making for a rather easy drinking brew. Overall – A rather decently big flavored brew at a lower abv. of only 4.8 %. A tasty one to try if you get a chance.

Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft.
Alpine Beer Company Captain Stout;Alpine, California, United States;Stout;Alpine Beer Company (CA);June 6th, 2015 - Alpine's got some serious chops but their Captain Stout is another tasty ale on the darker end of the spectrum. That probably means it's ignored by San Diego's drinking community but it deserves the same wide distribution. The aroma has a light malty and toasty character, and is quite dry with a light red grape note. The palate is dry and foamy, and smooth on the finish, though desiccates the palate. It's a little light quaffing the head with each sip, delivering ghirardelli chocolate, though even darker and drier than the dark chocolate. The dry finish is inviting, and before I know it, the stout is gone. January 10th, 2015 - Concluding our line of samplers tonight at Alpine Beer company is the Captain Stout, a nice and heavy brew with enough heft to run down what remains of the last few beers and claim its taste bud territory. While the aroma is very heavy on the chocolate malt, it also features beef jerky and the savory-sweet mixture of a good black bean sauce. The taste is more true to a standard stout profile, with a soft mouthfeel, and accented with a flecks of pepper notes to give it more nuance.

Town Hall Holiday Cheery Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"To quote from the brewer:""An Irish dry stout with doses of two different cherries. Red Tart cherries and dark sweet cherries were added to the fermenters to create the roasty delicate cherry taste. Only real fruit was used to make this beer, so the cherry flavor is actual."" Deep dark, practically black color, with rubyish tinges 'round the sides, crowned with a prodigious, creamy, fluffy head of chestnutty foam. Aroma: roasty, slightly bitter, espressoish, earthy, dry, with a hint of the cherries, but only if you know what you're looking for. Quite nice. Taste: Bittersweetness greets us right away, with the bright cherry flavor which rides comfortably in the mouth, and rolls along the palate, happily bumping up against the tastebuds. Body is medium, not too full, texture is just enough. And the cherry sweetness is always in your company, just right, not too sweet, not too tart. Probably the best fruit-flavored stout I've had...except when I think back on their Cabernet Stout from this fall...man, there's no stopping Town Hall! This was another nice accomplishment from Mr. Hoops, just enough stout, just enough cherry. Cheers!"
Town Hall Holiday Cheery Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On-Cask: Very deep mahogany brown with a glowing patchwork of ruby/brown at the edges. Medium ivory head of velvety smoothness, nice and tightly whipped looking. Foamed collar always present. Aroma is nice and sweet with a great roastyness behind. Has a twinge of woodyness with soft underlays of sweet cherry and semi-sweet chocolate. Taste is nice and mild with favorable sweetness in the roastyness and a softened cherryness with a nudge of tartness to it. There's a bit of woody tones to it that add some depth in the sweetness along with very light chcoclate, but all the flavors blend well together. Its not all that thick and doesn't seem necessary either as its firm full body and smooth creamy feel lend for a nice notion of drinking and flavor. Very nice sweet mild character with just the right amount of tartness and matches up with a easy clean finish. Nice calm texture too. A real winner for the snowtimes. One of the better cherry brews I've had without alot of that cherry sweet/sourness that seems to overwhelm, this has none of that really. Calming cherry character throughout. On-cask this was Good stuff!

Aromas of sugary caramel maltiness are all over the place. Taste was the same, but some light grapefruity hops were present.

Schloßbrauerei Fattigau Ritter Trunk;Oberkotzau-Fattigau, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Schloßbrauerei Stelzer Fattigau;500mL bottle from State Line, a dusty old number probably rescued from somewhere else, best before 26 09 17 but I'm going to give it a go ... for science. Nose with mild caramel but much stronger, darker roast, sort of a burned and scorched crust, nutty, melanoidin. Pour ends up a dusky light brown in the glass but it's clear ruby under direct light, head is large and creamy pale tan. Taste medium-strong sweet, barely any tang, low bitterness, this one is unapologetically malt-forward and fat with the sweet good stuff. Touch buttery, with mild red berry deep in the background, hint of cherry, really enjoyable complexity on the edges. Fullish body but not heavy, very repeatable and drinkable, clean, still fresh! Silky-smooth and gorgeously delicious, feel like I hit the jackpot with these finds. Süffig, indeed. [2019.07.01: 3.9]

Ap: Deep amber and clear; medium-small tan head with good retention, settling into a chubby wafer of foam. T: Caramel and toast, moderate-light sweetness; some grass and hay, with peppery hop flavor and a medium-low bitterness; a little chocolate and pomegranate; moves from base malt to caramel to sweet, earthy fruits; a little bit of waxy sherry in the background. P: Medium-light body with medium-high carbonation; somewhat creamy, finishing medium-dry. O: An enjoyable dunkel; lacks some focus, but does bring a slight degree of complexity across with the transforming malt/ester character; overall fairly clean and malt-forward."

Darker iced tea color. Nice tan head. Smells like mildly sweet malt & yeast. Yes a dunk but the alky shows thru a little. Not as civilized as other dunkels from the old country. Decent co2, a little misbehaved. Although never in yer face, with that dunkel thing going on, it never lets you know this is crafted the old country way. A little difficult to get used to. The domestic samples of Anderson Valley El Steinber Dark Lager, Weeping Radish Black Radish Dark Lager or even Penn Dark are better than this. So much more enjoyable. Must be the freshness, or is it the transportation? But hey, this is one beautifully made label on this bot.

Alpine Beer Company Willy Vanilly;Alpine, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Nothing good here. “Wheat ale” seems to be cover for a light, flavorless American-style blonde beer with nothing to offer but a moderate swath of vanilla on the back end. Tastes like a severely watered-down cream soda. Slight pilsnerish malts and a tiny bit of bread on the fade, but otherwise a vanilla spritzer. Hard pass.

Alpine Beer Company Willy Vanilly;Alpine, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Pale yellow, slight haze. Smells a little metallic. Odd nutty feel, perhaps some vanilla. Not impressed, but hey, I don't like filberts. Like many beers that attempt the nut thang. At only 5.5%, its still a little boozy.
Alpine Beer Company Willy Vanilly;Alpine, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Alpine Beer Company (CA);January 10th, 2015 - Alpine’s Willy Vanilly gets away from the hoppy theme of the first three tasters, getting to something that is much further away from a traditional brew. Gone are the hops and even the malts, instead mimicking a fancy soda with a bit of booze in the background. The aroma is immediately evocative of a cream soda with a graham cracker or two dipped in for a campfire accent, which seems to be a theme which keeps going through the flavor. Cream soda appears here again, and the graham cracker smell has evolved into full on s’mores, making this a sweet treat. It doesn’t taste much like a traditional beer, and I sort of wished I had saved it for last, but it is a curious product, and would work well for group members who don’t especially like beer as a genre.

Flying Goose Isle Of Pines Barley Wine;New London, New Hampshire, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Goose Brew Pub;"""Served in a Pilsner glass, I asked that I was able to have the 2009 and 2011 Isle of Pines (both on tap) served to me at the same time to compare to two tastes and the affects of 24 months of aging on a Barleywine that hasn’t left the brewery. This review is for the 2011 IoP Barleywine --- A - Dark amber color with a very thin head less than one finger. It was poured into a Pilsner glass which I found a bit odd. S - Brown sugar and honey entered my nose quickly and stayed with me. I could have sworn there was an oakiness to this beer but maybe I’m mistaken. T - Very beautiful taste for a medium bodied beer. As with most barley wines, the flavor feels thin until you swallow and then an eruption of tastes happen. I picked up watermelon hints that paired well with the sugary taste M - Very little carbonation, insanely dry with a champagne feel. An unobtrusive beer for a bowl of clam chowder or chili. O - I’d love to have this beer again. Just thinking about it is making me hungry. --- The 2009 IoP was similar to the 2011 but aging did a few things to it. If you can get to Flying Goose before the 2009 runs out (it’s on limited pour right now), do it. The 2009 was much darker and very cloudy, the brown sugar was more pronounced and other flavors were more muted and, of course, the carbonation was distant and fleeting from the mouthfeel. I preferred the 2009 to 2011 and I’d give it a 4.5 on Taste, Mouthfeel and Smell."""
Flying Goose Isle Of Pines Barley Wine;New London, New Hampshire, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Goose Brew Pub;On cask at The Flying Goose. Served in, what appeared to be, a 12 oz water glass. I know they can’t serve it in a 16 oz. pint glass, but I was expecting a snifter or a tulip. Pours a muddy reddish brown with a small beige cap. No lace. I marked it off a point because it just wasn’t very attractive. The aroma was sweet and pleasant, caramel malt, dark fruit, citrus and some earthy notes. Soft, warming palate with almost no carbonation. A little on the thin side. Flavor pretty much follows the aroma tit for tat. Perhaps a little more hop in the taste than is present in the aroma. Very pleasant brew to sip on while looking out the window at Mt. Sunapee.
Flying Goose Isle Of Pines Barley Wine;New London, New Hampshire, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Goose Brew Pub;2009 version. A dark reddish amber ale with a very thin off white head. In aroma, perfumey sweet strawberries, lightly hopped, vinous, muscat wine.

Flying Goose Isle Of Pines Barley Wine;New London, New Hampshire, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Goose Brew Pub;Nice complex amber-orange color with a reddish-brown haze. Generous off-white head procures ample lacing. Gentle citrus hops are the first to catch the attention. They throne above a sufficient earthy and grapey maltiness, leading the aromatics with citrusy, mostly pineapple flavours. Pleasant palate, very very fruity, citrusy, earthy. Tasty stuff for sure and well balanced at that. Definitely not mindbending, but this is indeed pretty good stuff if not worth driving hundreds of miles. Medium body, slightly creamy texture, moderately carbonated. Well contained alcohol. Probably my favourite out of the 17 beers available at Flying Goose that day.

Flying Goose Isle Of Pines Barley Wine;New London, New Hampshire, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flying Goose Brew Pub;"Sample at the brewpub. Great minds think alike I guess, as my review is almost identical with the preceding. Clear dark syrupy amber. Alcoholic malty sweet raisin caramel vanilla nose, outstanding though could be stronger. Enormously fruity body, maybe the fruitiest I've had in a barleywine: oranges, strawberries, cherry-vanilla. Little acid, smooth, late bitterness is well-integrated; thick full body is just a little too syrupy; a bit of pepperyness in the final moments. An outstanding young barleywine from this promising young brewer, a totally unpretentious guy who I chatted with for a few minutes at the end of my session. This guy's going places, I hope!"

Eindhovens Tripel;Schijndel, Netherlands;Tripel;Bierbrouwerij Sint Servattumus;Bottle: Had this one put away for a long while (preservability date: december 2007): Very nice vast white foamy head on top of a hazy orange beer. Smell honey, malts, grains, spices, corn and some fruit. Taste honey, red and yellow fruit, yeast, spices, hops, malts, bitter, light sweet, liquor, hint of warmth (alcohol), pretty well balanced. Aftertaste of red fruit, bitter and grass. Medium carbo, soft tingly mouthfeel, medium body.
Eindhovens Tripel;Schijndel, Netherlands;Tripel;Bierbrouwerij Sint Servattumus;Bottle: Poured a rusty copper with out a head. The aroma was sour and skunky fruit. Taste was oxidated, flat with a bit of caramel. I believe this bottle to be infected, but the best by date was Nov 08.
Eindhovens Tripel;Schijndel, Netherlands;Tripel;Bierbrouwerij Sint Servattumus;Bottled, alc. 8% (BB 10/2005) Hazy orange, decent off-white creamy head. Sweet lemony yeasty nose (strawberry, lime). Very acidy in the start. Citrusy bitter with added sugar which makes this unfortunately to sweet.
Eindhovens Tripel;Schijndel, Netherlands;Tripel;Bierbrouwerij Sint Servattumus;Dusty, somewhat acidic aroma with apple. Fat, buttery flavor, acidic with apple. A hint of vinegar, dusty, orange. A hint of sweet wood. Amateuristically brewed beer, far away from perfection.
Eindhovens Tripel;Schijndel, Netherlands;Tripel;Bierbrouwerij Sint Servattumus;This beer has a dark yellow body - hue apperance and a fine white scum collar. I have drunk the beer from the bottle and it had a medium carbonic acid. The initial flavor taste is bitter.
Jasper Murdocks Oh Be Joyful;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Mild Ale;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;Pours golden with white head. Aroma is biscuit malt and herbal hop. Flavor is sweet malt with some biscuit malt flavors and herbal hop finish.
Jasper Murdocks Oh Be Joyful;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Mild Ale;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;Pale yellow. Almost no head. Apple and low hopped lager aroma taste is tough. Corn, rice, honey, some hard candies
Jasper Murdocks Oh Be Joyful;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Mild Ale;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;22oz bottle picked up at the brewpub in Norwich, VT. Pours a crystal clear, pale yellow colored body with a thin, fizzy, off-white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a light lacing. Aroma is light and crisp citrus notes with some florals, grass, and grainy pale malts. A touch of bread and a few fruity yeast esters. Flavor is thinner, grainy pale malts with a light grassy citrus hopping. A few floral notes towards the end as this finishes clean, dry, and somewhat crisp with a very light bitterness. Medium length aftertaste following a light body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, a fairly simple, light, and crisp mild ale. Not a whole lot going on, but a light grassy citrus and thinner grainy malt backing keeps this decent enough. Eh...
Jasper Murdocks Oh Be Joyful;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Mild Ale;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;On draft at the brewery. Light brownish color with a white head. Light hops.m light nuttiness. Drinkable.
Jasper Murdocks Oh Be Joyful;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Mild Ale;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;on tap-pours a few bubbles and cloudy orange color. Aroma is soft orange, medium malt. Taste is soft orange/floral hops, medium malt. Soft/minimal carbonation. Easy.
Jasper Murdocks Oh Be Joyful;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Mild Ale;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;"From a bottle; mild in every way, but quite pleasant. Bready and a touch of sweetness. I don’t know what else to write."
Jasper Murdocks Oh Be Joyful;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Mild Ale;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;Cask (handpump) at NERAX North, Haverhill MA, 7 November 2009 @ 4.7%. Very murky orange colour. No condition. Fruity but estery aroma - slightly gluey. Better flavour. Cleaner fruit. Light, sweetish mouthfeel. Not great condition. Marked for re-rate when the opportunity arises. Didn’t realise this was supposed to be a mild, but the festival programme described it as an English Pale Ale (which seems nearer the mark) so perhaps the recipe has been changed.
Jasper Murdocks Oh Be Joyful;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Mild Ale;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;Finally... I’ve missed this one for two years now, but finally I get a chance to rate it. Tap at the Inn. Pale amber beer with a thin white head. Lovely aroma with pale UK malts, sweet berryish esters and a touch of Fuggles-like woody/spicy hops. Very soft bitterness on the back that just plays off of the fruity yeast and crisp clean malts. Tasty balanced brew.
Jasper Murdocks Oh Be Joyful;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Mild Ale;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;Sampled at 08 vt brewers fest. Pours a light amber with a thin white head. Aroma of light malts, caramel and a touch of hops. Flavor is similar to aroma with a smooth and round finish
Jasper Murdocks Oh Be Joyful;Norwich, Vermont, United States;Mild Ale;Jasper Murdock's Alehouse At The Norwich Inn;My Bottom Line: Biscuity pale maltiness builds a most comfortable body within which delicate fruity hops dally, creating tangerine honey allusions. This poundable Blonde Ale offers the purest delight that is well-extracted base maltiness. Further Personal Perceptions: -A slim veil of foam covers the hazy bronzed golden. -The aroma is not its best feature, sadly. -A second pint of this one is hard to avoid. -As for most of their beers that day, the head dies a tad too quickly. -Supporting hop bitterness is light and cannot quite achieve balance. This is a malt lover’s quencher. On tap at the brewpub.

Drinkable and mellow with unspecified tropical and floral hop; mandarins in jelly, peppery hints; underlying honey and biscuits sodden with Southern Comfort. Not bad."
Chelsea Hoppy Holiday Ale;Bronx, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Drought. Hazy, rich orange-yellow, with whitish foamy head, slight hops aroma, low carbonation, sweetish hoppy taste, long finish. Good but not special.
Chelsea Hoppy Holiday Ale;Bronx, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Tap at the brew pub, Chelsea Pier - 01/03/12. Listed at the brewpub as 9%ABV and titled ’Hoppy Holidays’. Mid brown verging on dirty orange in colour with a small to medium white head. Hoppy citrus nose with sweet malt and caramel background notes. Again taste is citrus but not mega hoppy, get a little biscuit and caramel and grassy notes. Medium bodied and easy drinking for it’s strength.
Chelsea Hoppy Holiday Ale;Bronx, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Dark brown body, creamy white head. Aroma has nice clear balance of cookies and fruity hoppiness. Flavour has caramelly malt touch and same balanced hop bite. Creamy and smooth palate. Quite nice.

Chelsea Hoppy Holiday Ale;Bronx, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Tap at Pony last night with Paul and Streets. Pours dark amber/brown with a full, thick, off-white head (no bubbles). I was expecting a lot of vegetable, earth, spice, etc. but this was really just a balanced and refreshing ale with a good level of hop bitterness and no pungent aftertaste. There was some spice and the mouthfeel was thicker, which is what I’d expect from a holiday beer, but it was almost more like an IPA or a pale ale in terms of flavor. Some reviews say 7%, RB says 8.4%, and the Pony chalkboard listed it at 9.2% last night ... in any case, it hides the high abv very well. Good beer. EDIT: I now see this is classified as a pale ale, so that makes sense...
Chelsea Hoppy Holiday Ale;Bronx, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;tap at barcade - nice citrusy, floral hopping, sweet caramel. candy. nice smooth palate. tasty
Chelsea Hoppy Holiday Ale;Bronx, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Tap @ Barcade. Clear brown with some off white head.

Chelsea Hoppy Holiday Ale;Bronx, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Tap at Blind Tiger as Hoppy Holidays ale 9.2%. So I dont know which entry to use for this one? Pours a deep amber, clear, nice head. Aroma is green, grassy, hoppy, caramel malts, toast, light sharpness, light burnt note, citrus and orange. Flavor is more citrus,, caramel malts, toast, biscuit, molasses, earth, and a pretty clean bitter finish. Pretty nice and very easy drinking despite the high alcohol and makes it stand apart from all the other high abv beers that were hard to drink last night.
Nelson Bays Draught Ale;Tahunanui, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Nelson Bays Brewery;Beers in this style are typically damned with faint praise... if they warrant any praise at all. NZ Draughts are usually sweet, brown and lacking any form of character, but this one has a bit more too it. This almost leans more toward its style descriptor as a Vienna with sweet biscuitiness and deeper amber colour.
Nelson Bays Draught Ale;Tahunanui, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Nelson Bays Brewery;The head is ok, the body orange-gold. It smells bit malty, airy. The taste is watery, mild, malty, bit creamy, grain

Harrington's Hercules Strong Dark Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pretty decent stuff. Sweet toffee/caramel malts, some sweet maple syrup/mollasses. A shot of alcohol at the end, but it actually adds to the flavour. Gives it a bit of body, warming finish. Quite nice.
Harrington's Hercules Strong Dark Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);starts off pretty anonymous but there's a warming alcohol bite in the finish. some molasses and plum reasonable
Harrington's Hercules Strong Dark Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Not very exciting, bronze, medium white head, alcohol in the aroma and also predominant in the flavour, toffee and roast barley flavours are a saving grace.
Harrington's Hercules Strong Dark Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I kept expecting Harringtons beers to be good for some reason and none of em were, particularly, although this is on the way to good-ness. it's an ale but has more in common with a big malty bock. rich and malty in aroma and flavour, with not much else apart from some warming, sweet alcohol. simple, but tasty.
Harrington's Hercules Strong Dark Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Big choclate.coffee aroma. Dark brown in colour, big head, mild spicey flavour. Coffee tatse lost in too much hops.
Martinborough Martins Lager;Martinborough, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);330ml bottle from the local Martinborough store. Fair gold colour, huge bursting/gushing head again. May well be another well aged sample. Lemonwood & buttery nose. Interesting palate - spicy with moderate malt throughout. & yes, belgian-like too. Well chilled for best effect probably.
Martinborough Martins Lager;Martinborough, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);bottle, brewtopia, melbourne. golden with a hint of green. light grassy aroma, reasonably bitter, pretty decent quencher
Martinborough Martins Lager;Martinborough, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);Tasted 23/08/2005. 330ml, bottle conditioned. Golden, hazy, and volcanic carbonation unbelievably firey! This took the steadiest hand in the world to pour the entire 330ml into a a full english pint glass. Huge white, rocky, head is very Duvel-like. Nose is quite yeasty, slightly sulphurish, a little spicey, with light underlying malt perfume and a lemony hop influence. Again it comes across quite belgian. The hops and a slightly sulphurous flavour dominate with a long astringent finish. Overly carbonated nature makes it a little unpleasant on the palate. There’s much potential in this recipe, with a bit of refinement and a longer lagering it might be a real winner - an earthy, bottle-conditioned, lager.
Martinborough Martins Lager;Martinborough, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);Bottled, thanks Linc! Hazy golden with extremely rich head. Soft and sweet with lemony nose. Solidly malty and well hopped with salty finish.
Martinborough Martins Lager;Martinborough, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);Hazy dark straw colour, big creamy head, little aroma, bitter hoppy tatse. Nice interpretation of Englisgh style beer.
Martinborough The Square Ale;Martinborough, New Zealand;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);"(Bottle 33 cl) Reading the latest ratings of this got me scared almost shitless. But the beer proved not to be that explosive. It did give a loud ""BANG"" when I unscrewed the cap though. Then it poured slightly cloudy with a gigantic and very lively shaving foam style off-white head that dissipated rather slowly. Aroma of malt and caramel - perhaps a little overripe fruit. There’s a vague, underlying acidity before a dry finish. Fearing the worst this turned out to be a rather drinkable if unspectacular Amber Ale. 180208"
Martinborough The Square Ale;Martinborough, New Zealand;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);330ml bottle purchased from the local store in Martinborough. Exploded from the bottle after having it at least a month in the fridge. Black floaties, rotton cider smell. Tipped it out
Martinborough The Square Ale;Martinborough, New Zealand;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);"Retasted 01/02/2006. Gusher. Dusty aroma, with a hint of orange. Severe pedicoccus problems. Gets a point for not exploding and cutting me but that is about it. Tasted 15/10/2005. A stubbie, with brunch, at Jono’s after a nice ride around the bays. Bright, copper colour. Thin, off-white, head that disappears. Some mild apple esters and caramel-like malt on the nose, little in the way of hops. Thin, mild, unintersting, ""NZ brown"" flavour. Didn’t really grab me and say ""Have another one, go on!"". I didn’t note if this was bottle-conditioned but I assume it is, given that all the others are. Reasonably well made but certainly my least favourite from this brewery, it’s all a bit nothingy. Re-tasted 28/02/2006: 330ml bottle at Great India. Definitely bottle conditioned. Had ten minutes to air and warm before I sampled it this time but there was little improvement. I think a reasonable homebrewer could make an ale like this with a kit."
Martinborough The Square Ale;Martinborough, New Zealand;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);Bottled, thanks Linc! Hazy copper colour, small head. Toffee aroma. Sweetish and light bodied with clean, fizzy mouthfeel and fairly low bitterness. Too light and neutral.

Martinborough Tora Dark;Martinborough, New Zealand;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);330ml bottle from my brother that I bought for him ages ago...!! I was fearful as to how this had aged but I was pleasantly surprised. Coke like with ruby hues. Nice head. Roasty dominant coffee / cocoa palate. Reasonable body a nice drop given it’s age.
Martinborough Tora Dark;Martinborough, New Zealand;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);Dark, coffee tasting beer with loads of roasty flavours. A little bit of butter on the palate too. Decent.

Dark brown with reddish hints and a thick tan head that holds up pretty well. Nice pungent aroma of vanilla, chocolate and liquorice is very tempting. Medium-light weight delivers a smooth roasty malt flavour with a dry finish. Good coffee-like oily bitterness on the palate. Pleasant.
Martinborough Tora Dark;Martinborough, New Zealand;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Martinborough Brewing Co. (Retired);Initial taste is moderately bitter with a mild aftertaste of Coffee. Medium body. A great beer on a hot day!

Coeur d'Alene Vanilla Bourbon Stout;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Draft at Moscow alehouse. Same name, but different city (Spokane) and abv (5.3). Move if necessary. Dark brown pour, creamy brown head. Vanilla, coffee, milk chocolate, sour copper coated in plastic. I hope something is off with this. Roast bitter coffee finish, medium body, smooth texture.
Coeur d'Alene Vanilla Bourbon Stout;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;I really like this beer and was upset when they closed the CdA brewery. I recently had it in Spokane on tap and thought the taste was still great. A bit heavy to have more than one, especially with food. The Steamplant offers it more often than the CdA facility did. The hint of vanilla and bourbon combine for a great finish to this stout.
Coeur d'Alene Vanilla Bourbon Stout;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub in Coeur d’Alene in August 2009. Couldn’t put this review in with the rest of my backlog earlier, as this place was listed as closed for a period of time. I’ll start off by saying that this was one of the worst beers that I’ve ever had, and probably the worst that doesn’t come in an aluminum can and have the color of urine. The color is a deep black. No head. No lacing. No legs. There is nothing going for this--it looks like still, thin mud. This was probably also the best aspect of the beer, as it only irritated me rather than making want to vomit. The nose and taste are both just disgustingly awful and each aging component of the beer deserves its own F. The vanilla was ridiculously overpowering and tasted like they dumped an ounce of vanilla extract into my pint prior to serving it. The bourbon component was equally horrendous was just overpowering amounts of booze. This seriously smelled more bourbony than bourbon. The two did not combine well, either. Everything about this beer was harsh and boozy. This was downright awful and I could barely stand to keep my nose within a foot of it, let alone drink that much. I tried to go back to it as it warmed, but it was just so, so, so bad. I am not exaggerating when I say that I literally threw up a bit in my mouth after trying this. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 11-30-2010
Coeur d'Alene Vanilla Bourbon Stout;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Draught and cask at the brewpub (Spokane, WA location). Near black, small head creamier from cask. Burnt vanilla aroma. Dryish with clean simple mouthfeel. The cask version has a woody tartness which seem unfitting, but the lowe carnonation also enhances the mouthfeel. Coffee and vanilla are obvious. Medium bitterness.
Coeur d'Alene Vanilla Bourbon Stout;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;On tap at Brewforia in Meridian,ID. Black with a smal tan head that dissipated quickly. Up front vanilla and oak aroma. Roasted flavors and again plenty of vanilla. Not so much Bourbon but quite woody. Plenty of carbonation and as I warms up a bit it will improve in general. A somewhat thin pallate and a strange chalky feel as well. Lingering soft Bourbn and vanilla trailer.
Coeur d'Alene Vanilla Bourbon Stout;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;5 oz sample at brewpub. Solid black, medium size light tan head.

Coeur d'Alene Vanilla Bourbon Stout;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Tap @ Alehouse: Near black with a thin brown head. Aroma is pure sweet vanilla with a light amount of bourbon. Taste is a blend of vanilla, light char, espresso, and chocolate. Very minimal bourbon presence, really quite the right amount in this case. Slightly thin in the body. Still damn good.
Coeur d'Alene Vanilla Bourbon Stout;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Stout - Imperial;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Opaque, near black color with a thin lid of tan bubbles. Great aroma of bourbon vanilla. Some dark chocolate and roasted malt also in the nose. Flavors start with a sweet caramel and lead into roasted malt and dark chocolate. Middle fills with mild bourbon and and vanilla. Finish is roasty and a touch thin.

Pours pitch black with a nice tan head that lasted the entire pint. Aroma was very nice! Big vanilla up front with hints of bourbon and chocolate. Flavor is vanilla and bourbon up front with hints of chocolate and oak in the finish. This was the brew I enjoyed the most out of the CDL beers I tried this evening.
Ramapo Valley Smoked Lager;Hilburn, New York, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Looks like a good, darker lager with a crystal clear, light copper body. Smells mildly smokey and even a little of honey. Mild flavor, and very smooth. The smoke comes out a little more in the flavor, but it's not too over-bearing like the Stone Smoked Porter. Slightly sweet. A decent lager.
Ramapo Valley Smoked Lager;Hilburn, New York, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Ramapo Valley Brewery;"Light copper in color, with a decent lacing, medium carbonation - not much smoke in the aroma - some sweet, bready smells - flavor hardly has any smoke either, but it is noticable behind everything else - tastes like a Vienna style lager, quite a bit of malty sweetness, a touch of caramel - moderate hop presense to round it out - subdued in the ""smoked"" department, but quite a good lager."
Grand Teton Illuminator Doppelbock;Victor, Idaho, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Tap: brown with thin tan head. Aroma is malty sweet with grain and toffee. Flavor is sweet with caramel, toffee, grain, some green apple and a touch of soy sauce. Palate is thick, sticky and sweet with a dash of salt. I liked the flavor, somewhat malty sweet for me, but I could drink more.
Grand Teton Illuminator Doppelbock;Victor, Idaho, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Pours a brownish almost root beer colored. Sweet caramel/malt aromas. Smooth malty flavor with a nice hop bite.
Grand Teton Illuminator Doppelbock;Victor, Idaho, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;On tap at Boonville Beer Fest. An interesting (and good) doppelbock. Amber color with an off-white head. Aroma of caramel malt, oak, tea, dark fruits, and a little alcohol. Flavor is very malty with brown sugar, toffee, apple and other fruits, and a nice hop bite at the end that you rarely get with this style. Smooth, fairly full palate.
Grand Teton Illuminator Doppelbock;Victor, Idaho, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Aroma: smells of apple juice, carmel malts, finger nail polish remover, spices, old wood, plums and other dark fruits, and rubbing alcohol.

Grand Teton Illuminator Doppelbock;Victor, Idaho, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Truly beautiful 1L bottle, the Cellar Reserve. Clear, red-brown appearance with a dead head--burns off really fast. Alcohol-malt aroma, somewhat nutty. Flat and syrupy palate. Long caramel finish with a bit of honey in the flavor. Not my favorite dopplebock--it needs more life in multiple dimensions (aroma and palate).
Grand Teton Illuminator Doppelbock;Victor, Idaho, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Distributed in a one liter bottle with melted red wax over a flip-top cap. Takes some work to open the bottle, but is cool nonetheless. Pours a dark amber-brown color with virtually no head. Has an strong alcohol aroma. Has caramel and alcohol flavor.
Grand Teton Illuminator Doppelbock;Victor, Idaho, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Thanks to Jordan and Mike for the bottle! Brown and red appearance with close to no head. Dark cherries and wood with alcohol in the aroma. Light and smooth carbonation, wet and watery but not thin. Apples, musty wood, almonds and butter flavors. Quite good.
Grand Teton Illuminator Doppelbock;Victor, Idaho, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Dark red/ruby color with light head and similar lacing. Aroma is moderately hoppy, slightly fruity, but none of the essential bock qualities that I look for. The flavor is pretty well balanced with a moderate sweetness and a good amount of hops, even more so than is usual present in a bock. The finish is ultra smooth though. I really enjoyed this one. As much as it didn't seem like much of a doppelbock, it was still a terrific beer.
Grand Teton Illuminator Doppelbock;Victor, Idaho, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;In the light, it's a very nice ruby hue. Out of it, it appears a bit more brown. I got very little head on this pour. Sweet malts in the nose, a bit of spice and some small hop like characteristics. The flavor is bursting with malts, some breads. Almost a candy like flavor, along the lines of red licorice or bubblegum. Full bodied, and a molasses like palate. Very nice doppelbock.
Odell Harvest Hemp Lager;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Odell Brewing Company;Odell's Harvest Hemp Lager was available at the brewery on one of their rotating pilot taps. I think it was around 6.? % ABV. The description said that it was orignally intended to be an Oktoberfest, but it was late and they used darker malts. I got this from the brewery yesterday in a growler and didn't get a chance to try it until today, so it may not have been as fresh as possible. It poured a dark brown with ruby highlights, and had almost no head and very little carbonation (maybe due to being a day old?). It had a nice aroma of roasted malts with a touch of sweet chocolate. It's taste was exactly what you would expect from the smell...a sweetish roasted malty taste (that became more pronounced as it warmed), with a little bitter aftertaste that was not really hoppy though. It tasted a little watery, but was very drinkable nonetheless. Overall, it reminded me a lot of a slightly weak porter, not very lagery at all. I would definitely drink this again, and can hopefully try it fresher next time.

Fire Station 5 Fire Drill ESB;Portland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Murky orange pour with a non descript white head. Very mild hop presence and some alright malt flavor. Mediocrity.
Fire Station 5 Fire Drill ESB;Portland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Always interesting to see what kind of beers you run into when you help someone move - Seen a lot of this on store shelves, first try: Sweet and bitter - true to its name i suppose. Very thin bodied. Not much hop flavor and the malt was not really interesting. Ok overall but very boring.
Fire Station 5 Fire Drill ESB;Portland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"A very drinkable ""session’ beer, but lacking in robust flavor or bitterness. Pours amber with small head and very filtered. A mass produced beer that is OK."
Fire Station 5 Fire Drill ESB;Portland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);[12oz Bottle] Deep amber color with a hoppy aroms and al ight head. This was a surpisingly nice EBS had some flavor but the finish was missing. This is way mass produced and had too many flaws to be a great beer. Metal flavor and a very heavy yeast flavor also.
Fire Station 5 Fire Drill ESB;Portland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);poured from bottle. Orange color, white head which diminished quickly. Aroma of faint hops and slight fruit. Hoppy, well carbonated palate. Flavor of hops and fruit, maybe citrus. Finishes clean but leaves a little metallic after bite.
Fire Station 5 Fire Drill ESB;Portland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Light fruity aroma. reddish amber. Decent hops up front but quickly overpowered by metalic taste, finishes light and somewhat sour. Probably won’t buy again.
Fire Station 5 Fire Drill ESB;Portland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This is so far from an ESB. This tastes more like an amber ale, the malt character way overpowers anything else, and leaves very little if anything to be bitter, except for a slight bit of hoppiness in the finish.
Fire Station 5 Fire Drill ESB;Portland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours a medium amber color. Aromas of hops and some sweet malt. Flavor not as pleasant as the nose. Nice hop bitterness at the finish.
Haägen Premium Gold;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Very average. Bitter in a bad way, chemical taste prevails. Doesn’t take long before the main taste is backwash, as there’s not much other flavour to push out of the way.
Haägen Premium Gold;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);The only saving grace of this beer is the ABV, but this should not be a reason to buy it. Not very smooth at all and quite cloyingly sweet.
Haägen Premium Gold;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);"330 ml. bottle, served in a lager glass. Standard golden colour with a frothy white head and a few bubbles. Nice ""bite"" and a little potato-like after-taste. Good New Zealand made six-percenter."
Haägen Premium Gold;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);Tasted 25/05/2005. 330ml bottle at Neil Miller’s Cellar-Vate tasting. Pale yellow. White head thats a touch lacey. A little bit skunky on the nose and sweeter than I’d expect. Some chemical and vegetable notes detected in the flavour. At least its not overly carbonated. Rates quite well on Roger Wilson’s price/alcohol ratio but is not too flash otherwise. Avoid, unless you are cheap.
Haägen Premium Gold;Papakura, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Independent Breweries NZ (Boundary Road);straw colour, small white head, sweet maly aroma, sweet malty water basicly. Has a kick though at6%

Shenandoah Chicha SummerFest;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Shenandoah Brewing Company;"Super hazy golden colour with a thin fast-dying white head. Aroma of lemons, yeast, wheat, coriander seed and curacao. Light-bodied; Very carbonated; Odd complexity in the taste-Starts out very spicey with nutmeg, cloves and coriander seed all prevalent. Next comes the sweetness of curacao, brown sugar and sweet peaches. Finally, the taste is topped by the tartness of sour lemons. The most complex wheat i've ever tasted! Aftertaste (way afterwards) is a nice combination of all the three aformentioned stages in the taste...lasting long, especially for a wheat! I bought this twelve ounce bottle at Shenandoah Brewing Company in Alexandria, Virginia and sampled it on 21-December-2003."
Asda British Bitter;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Asda (Wal Mart);Not bitter at all: clear metallic taste, finish is grainy and watery. Cheap and nasty.
Youngers Kestrel Pilsner Lager;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);Aroma is malt, alcohol, and peppery hops. Flavor is malt, alcohol, and a peppery bitter finish.
Youngers Kestrel Pilsner Lager;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);Is this a drink or is it a way of life for the poor unemployeds that rely on this bilge to get them through the day. Back in the day, this once sent me over the edge and into a cell. Tee hee, makes me chuckle to look back! So bad is it is nearly good. Nearly.
Youngers Kestrel Pilsner Lager;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);"A legendarily bad UK lager. Weaker than water with no apparent taste evident. This is the opposite of Tennants Super and Special Brew. When I was a young whipper snapper at University and a bit of an all round bad boy, I used to get drunk on this stuff, though it did take about a hundred cans. You could say it was a ""Kestrel for a Knave"" in those days, and those were the days!!!"
Youngers Kestrel Pilsner Lager;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);Canned. Very pale straw color and rather respectable thick head. Aroma of freshness and hops (it is brewed with Zatec ones). Light and slightly hoppy palate, amazingly drinkable.
Mighty Oak Triple Dick;Maldon, Essex, England;Porter;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Purple black coloured body with a tan scum thinly clinging to the top of the glass. Absolutely divine. Masses and masses of aroma leaping off this beer. Coffee and aniseed blanket the chocolate and black malt flavours. Silky smooth palate. Full and round. Very enjoyable indeed, thought that I had better make a session of it yesterday. Just have to love Christmas in the cold. All the best beers come to town.

Fruity taste, malty, a bit dry finish. Surprisingly drinkable in the end. Funny style this Kolsch. Have to admit that a majority of the examples I had were weak, thin and light on flavor. This is still those things, but at least on the positive end of the spectrum.

Ortliebs Winter Wheat;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ortliebs Brewery & Grille at Sunnybrook Ballroom;This beer is a little too light in flavor, mass, and finish for me. It is gold in color, with decent hoppiness and overtones of citrus, honey, and wheat. Not very complex, but fairly well balanced. Women seem to crave it. Summer wheat might be a better name for this one.

Sjarelke Donker;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Dubbel;De Proefbrouwerij;"Een voor mij totaal onbekend bier, gedronken in de Demervallei. Dit Belgisch bier zou niet meer in België op de markt komen (?!), en enkel nog verkopen in het buitenland (USA?) onder de naam ""Innocentus"". Dit was dan ook de Innocentus versie, strak label. Van kleur is hij zwart, beperkte schuimkraag. Afdronk is heel zacht, lang uitgerekt, warm. Mout, licht kruidig. Stevige nasmaak, met hint van karamel en chocolade. Is dat een bittere touch op het einde? Alleszins, heel aangenaam, lekker bier, spijtig dat de neus niet meer op voorgrond komt. Mooie verrassing!"

Pumphouse Wassail;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draught. Body is medium orange brown.

Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, syrupy texture, lively carbonation. Oddly, not much bitterness, spice or otherwise, comes out in the finish, making this rather too sweet to drink much of. Smells nice though.
Pumphouse Wassail;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draft - If holiday spices are your thing, then you would like this beer. Smells great, tastes a little less intense than the smell, but not much. As far as spiced ales go, this one is pretty good. I would not want more than one though.
Pumphouse Wassail;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Nice allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg nose, but they didn't carry thru to well into the flavor, different, but not exciting

CooperSmiths Existential Porter;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Porter;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;"From Jun 2007 This pours a very dark brown bordering on pitch black with a very small head of foam. The smell I'm getting is of roasted malt but it's very light on the nose. The taste is very complex. I'm getting some roasted malt but I'm also getting some sweetness and that's followed by some fruitiness, mainly plum and raisin, and a bit of citrus in the background. Very tasty and very easy drinking. Wow. I can't keep my glass on the table for very long....I just want to and have to take another sip. The finish isn't even slightly bitter in the least; I just get more of that dark fruit goodness and it has a very smooth mouthfeel. I think this is a fine example of an American Porter and anyone that visits Coopersmiths in FT Collins should *not* miss trying it. I love it!"
CooperSmiths Existential Porter;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Porter;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;A pretty good porter, but slightly unbalanced. Hop forward and somewhat watery at the end. Tried at the brewery with the parents in 2013.

CooperSmiths Existential Porter;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Porter;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Had this on-tap at the brewery. Beer poured a clear, very dark, nearly opaque brown color with a small, creamy, lasting tan head. The aromas contain notes of dark chocolate, lightly smokey peat and coffee. The flavor is initially quite salty and slightly sweet but mostly bland with a very short, smokey finish. Unlike any other porter I’ve had yet, and a little off-putting. The palate was medium-to-thick with a velvety texture and soft carbonation.
Library Dubliners Stout;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Stout;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;At the brewpub in August of 2007, as part of the sampler. This was the best of the five I tried but that may be damning with faint praise. A very nice dark pour and a somewhat tan head. A roasted coffee aroma with hints of malt and chocolate. The flavor matched the aroma but was slightly watered.

Library Dubliners Stout;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Stout;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;A nicely flavored stout. Roasty malts and bitter hops balance nicely.

Lots of well roasted coffee notes throughout and a hint of dark chocolate.

Library Odwyers Irish Ale;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;on tap-pours a white head that laces and yellow color. Aroma is sweet malt. Taste is sweet malt, light body.
Library Odwyers Irish Ale;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;Irish Ale?!? . . . there is no such beer style. As a result, every Irish ale is open to the interpretation of the brewer doing the brewing. Most consider it an amber ale utilizing British hops. That being said, this ale misses the mark. It tastes like ’old, stale’ hops were using in the brewing as evidenced by a ’cheezy’ hop flavor.
Library Odwyers Irish Ale;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;Pours a reddish amber and is kind of reticent in stlye, this could be a lot better beer. It is not that bad, but just kind of rserved in style. Nutty caramel nose, with some roasted chocolate flavors. Very drinkable, but turns kind of watery in the finish.

Library Odwyers Irish Ale;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;"Didn’t detect the off-flavors mjames did; they must’ve fixed that problem. Medium amber and clear with a creamy head. Nice and foamy texture. HUGE caramel sweetness exudes throughout. A decent amount of bitterness almost balances things out, but the heavy sweetness definitely prevails. Malt flavors were really tasty ... nice malt bill. However, sweetness became a bit much for me."
Library Odwyers Irish Ale;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Library Sports Grille & Brewery;Medium orange. Contains a very bad malty-vegetable and cardboard flavor. Smooth body, but just awful flavor with a similar aroma.
Altitude Mistletoe IPA;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;IPA;Altitude Chophouse and Brewery;Clear dark orange. A big burnt wood and cinnamon flavor. An OK IPA, but missing a needed hop punch. Rich ans syrupy.
Altitude Winter Bock;Laramie, Wyoming, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Altitude Chophouse and Brewery;Served too cold. Has a soft cloudy red/amber hue. A robust peach, nut, and wood flavor. Quite good, very soft and subtle flavor and mouthfeel. Aroma of dark fruit and some light wheat. Very nice.

Dark, but that’s where the consistency with ""dunkel weizen"" ends .... this is chalky, smoky, sweet. No real wheaty consistency, no real body.

Roosters Brewing Holiday Rosemary Porter;Locations in Ogden and Layton, Utah, United States;Flavored - Other;Roosters Brewing Co.

Rosemary is really light in the aroma; In the flavor, it’s subdued by the caramel malt, coming out more in the finish. A little stronger at a warmer temperature, but still less Rosemary than I remember in the past--which is probably a good thing."

Roosters Brewing Holiday Rosemary Porter;Locations in Ogden and Layton, Utah, United States;Flavored - Other;Roosters Brewing Co. (US);Calling this a porter is a stretch, as it is exploding with so much rosemary, there is not any room left for anything else. Dark glowing purple with a huge tan foamy head. Nose is a beautifully nice roasted potpourri and ginger and spices. Flavor is pretty much the same, like chewing on flower petals.

Süßlicher Mittelteil, der an keinen Bierstil so richtig erinnert. Der Nachgeschmack ist vorerst auch süß. Dieser kippe dann aber und lässt eine herbe Seite hervorkommen, die allerdings auch nicht wirklich ausgeprägt ist. Besonders im Antrunk lässt sich sie Fülle eines Weizenbieres erahnen, nicht ungelungen! Test vom 7.5.2007, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 6,8,10,9,6,9 - 8,55

Moon River Super Fest;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Moon River Brewing Company;New Favorite. Light but still has a body. Crisp and bite. Flavor but not overpowering.
Moon River Super Fest;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Moon River Brewing Company;Lightly hazy, deep golden ale with a small, creamy, white head. The nose is fruity and malty with notes of alcohol, orange, pear, apricot and cantaloupe with a hint of English toffee and caramel. The flavor is of honey dew and cantaloupe with lots of alcohol, bitter hops and caramel. Full-bodied with an alcoholic mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Short, lightly tart, alcoholic finish. Very good stuff, although the alcohol is a bit overbearing.
Moon River Super Fest;Savannah, Georgia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Moon River Brewing Company;"Tight, creamy, white head diminishes to a crown on a deep amber body. Caramel, nutty malt (H); citric hops (L); no real ester presence. Heavily sweet throughout with a lightly bitter finish. Cloying sweetness. Medium-heavy body, creamy texture, soft carbonation. The bottom line is: tastes like they tripled the malt bill without adjusting the hops."

Nez sûr de levures fruitéess (agrumes, surtout de citron, traces de pêche trop mûres) et léger de grains de malt. Plutôt mince en bouche. Goût sûr et aux notes acides de levures fruitées (surtout agrumes, léger de pommes vertes cidreuses) lors de l’entrée en bouche suivi d’un goût de grains de malt sucrés avec des traces de caramel.

Les Frères Houblon Bière Rousse;Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Les Frères Houblon;Originally rated November 2006. Bought in a convenient store in the Saguenay region. The numbers for the date of bottling are there, but nothing is notched off... what a waste of info. Pours a murky orange-beige-brown colour with a tanned foamy head that stays a while. Good lacing all-around and a coating tops the brew. Sediments on the light-colour side are at the bottom of the glass. That’s about all I have good to say about this one. The rest is like most of their other brews, seems infected. Sour lemony nose with some hop. Sour taste too with whatever hop they are using. Some acceptable red apple flavour comes out of this and mild coffee, late in the aftertaste.
Les Frères Houblon Bière Rousse;Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Les Frères Houblon;Bière totalement opaque à la couleur de dattes et coiffée d’un léger col chamoix. Des arômes de pâte à pain, de caramel avec des notes étranges (pour une amber ale) de cerises confites et d’alcool. Légèrement amère avec un peu de sucre résiduel rappelant le miel. De corps moyen à l’effervescence légère elle est de texture huileuse. Elle laisse une fin raisonnablement arômatique et légèrement sucrée.
Les Frères Houblon Bière Rousse;Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Les Frères Houblon;500mL bottle from Mache Jovi in Gatineau. Pours a muddy brown with a huge beige head (this one was a gusher). The aroma is extremely faint, sharp floral aspects but not in a hoppy way, fizz, basically nothing. Flavour is equally empty. Mild sweet indistinct malts, extremely fizzy palate, boring, seriously, seriously boring. Totally void of any redeeming qualities, other than being drinkable, but mostly because water tends to be pretty drinkable. English Pale Ale almost seems like a sarcastic joke of a classification, granted, ’Bad Home Brewed Attempt at Nothing’ isn’t really a style. There’s really nothing to give points to here.
Les Frères Houblon Bière Rousse;Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Les Frères Houblon;Very muddy red body with a thick frothy head Faint aroma of sugar, metal and raw malt. Flavour is light caramel, roasted malt, herbs, brown sugar and raw cereals with a thin to medium body and agressive carbonation. Malty,not much hops. I swore not to drink anything from this brewery again, so I’m pleasantly surprised by this one. It’s not anything special, but my expectations where really really low. I might give them another chance sometime...
Les Frères Houblon Bière Rousse;Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Les Frères Houblon;Bouteille de 500 ml. La bière est de couleur cuivrée et possède un col de mousse modeste. Au nez on découvre des arômes de caramel, de gâteau aux fruits, de levure et de noix. En bouche le corps est moyen avec une effervescence faible-moyenne. On goûte des saveurs de caramel, de fruits rouges, de grain légèrement grillé, de levure et d’épices. Une subtile présence d’alcool est aussi perceptible.

Les Frères Houblon Bière Rousse;Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Les Frères Houblon;Bottle: Poured a light clear brown color ale with a huge off-white foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of caramel malt is lightly sweet. Taste is mostly dominated by some lightly sweet caramel malt with some light notes of some weird ester some chemical or infected. Body is about average with some great carbonation. I have not had a beer from this brewery in years and this definitely better then expected but still not totally great.
Les Frères Houblon Bière Rousse;Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Les Frères Houblon;Contrairement au commentaire. Je l’ai beaucoup apprécié comme presque toutes les bières de cette brasserie. Goût un peu dur mais agréable après accomodation de la bouche.
Keltic Lager;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Clear, pale straw w/ a quickly dissipating white head. Sweet aroma of honey & canned corn w/ notes of nail polish remover. Light, watery feel. Sweet, bland flavour.
Keltic Lager;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;She’s been sitting in my fridge for just over 2 months, so it is just cold enough to drink. Pale gold, huge white quick dissipating head. Aroma is a bit sappy with a little pine hop, corn syrup remains. Fairly clean but very boring as far as anything deriving of flavour or palate. I only sample as very cold so I’m sure when it warmed up this beer is as bad as I imagined. Has a fried chicken flair to it. Pretty lousy. Probably the ugliest marketing i’ve seen on a can. Looks really cheap, tastes only kinda cheap. Pale lagers.....why?
Keltic Lager;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Corn and rice nose, straw, pours a tiny white head. Tastes of corn with adjuncts. Thin. Whew! Thank You OKBeer and jerc.
Keltic Lager;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Sample at DougShoemaker’s 2005 December gathering - cans courtesy of jerc and OKBeer (via mr_kimchee). Pale yellow with a pillowy white head. Not much aroma, but there is a definate hint of the high-gravity corn alcohol that this stuff was probably watered down from. Flavour is similar - bland, with a surprisingly harsh finish. Another shitty macro wannabe, whoop-dee-doo.
Keltic Lager;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;A slight improvement over most macros. LIght yellow colour with some foamy head. Metallic corn taste and smell. A whiff of citrus. Cannot finish ’er. Very sweet and watery. A whimsical gift from Bob and Jeremy C.
Keltic Lager;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Can at ’December at DougShoemaker’s 2005’ -- courtesy of OKBeer & jerc. Pours a clear bubbly light gold with a medium sized white head. Very mild aroma (it’s practically scentless!) of sweet grain and not much else. The flavour, what little there is, is crap -- all sweet grain. Watery and bland, there’s just no reason to drink this.

Keltic Lager;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;"Again, I take offense to brewers everywhere who bastardize the Irish culture to make shitty beers. Especially when they spell the name of the greatest football team (and fans) to ever grace a pitch with a K instead of a C. There, I’ve said it. Can at Doug’s, Christmas ’05, courtesy of our East Coast buddy OKBeer and out traveling student Ontario rating champion Jerc, who were kind enough to send us stuff without even being there. Light yellow, medium white head. No taste, no aroma, there is a faint hint that this was indeed made with malt and yeast. Boring and inoffensive. To quote Mr. Kimchee ""Someone dropped some toast in some water"". Perfect."
Keltic Lager;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Can. Very pale yellow body, with a big white head on first pour. Sweet floral aroma, muted grains. Not entirely pleasant bittereness in the flavour, which is otherwise a generic sweetness. Finish and aftertaste are acerbic in a strange manner. Average to thin palate. Mostly inoffensive, quite boring.
Keltic Lager;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Can from OKBeer and jerc. Ugly pale yellow. Pretty much an empty beer, faint possible malt flavor, some citrus. Thin, watery body. Nope, not very good.
Portsmouth Bluebeery;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portsmouth Brewery;Thanks Doug! Poured my portion into a nonic pint glass, the appearance was a ruddy semi-dark brown color with some sly blue hues to the edge of the glass. Finger’s worth of white foamy head dissipated at a nice pace. Sly lacing. The aroma centers around the blueberry with a sly sweet crust like a pie sliding in underneath. The flavor yields the same sort of fruity blueberry sweetness, subtle tartness from it. Sly sweet to tart blueberry aftertaste with finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Gentle smoothness coming from a low carbonation. Overall, nice refreshing blueberry ale, good for the Summer months, probably only have again then.
Portsmouth Bluebeery;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portsmouth Brewery;Pours murky blue tinged brown into a snifter. White head quickly recedes to mottle surface. Mild blueberry aromas. Dry with sweet blueberry upfront turning to a hint of cobbler and earthy skin and seeds in the medium length finish.
Portsmouth Bluebeery;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portsmouth Brewery;Decent but not great. Not much blueberry in the aroma. mostly malt and caramel. Same with the flavor. Just a faint blueberry essence.
Portsmouth Bluebeery;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portsmouth Brewery;Location: Draft at the Brewpub, 7/12/13 Aroma: A nice mix of bready and caramel malts, grassy hops, and, of course, blueberry Appearance: It pours a ruby-orange color, with a small head and some light lacing Flavor: The taste is much the same, the blueberry is present, not fake, and doesn’t overpower Palate: It has a light but not watery feel to it, it is clean and easy drinking Overall Impression: Overall, this is a tasty blueberry beer. Anytime you are in Maine/NH in the summer you see a lot of blueberry beers. Some of them have all the fake blueberry flavor and nothing else, some of them have a nice, fresh blueberry feel that doesn’t overpower everything else. I prefer the later category. This one is one of those.
Portsmouth Bluebeery;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portsmouth Brewery;On draft at Portsmouth Brewery. Pours a clear amber with red highlights. Nose is blueberry extract, lots of sweetness, and a bit of caramel. Flavor is similar- blueberry extract, some malts. Light to medium in body and not really my style.
Portsmouth Bluebeery;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portsmouth Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Reddish purple brown pour with a small white head.

Portsmouth Bluebeery;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portsmouth Brewery;Berry colored pour. Fruity/ berry aroma. Decent blueberry flavor, seems genuine. A nice summer fruit beer
Portsmouth Bluebeery;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portsmouth Brewery;Tod gave us a nice tour yesterday. This one is brewed with real blueberries, no artificial flavors or additives. No over- powering berry smell, like some other blueberry ales I’ve had. This is what I would call high end for it’s style. Very good summer drinker!
Portsmouth Bluebeery;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portsmouth Brewery;Reddish brown pour, Really a Fantastic looking beer. Served with blueberries. Malty aroma with some subtle blueberry notes. Flavor was pleasant, not overly sweet or syrupy. The base beer was caramel malty and the blueberry complimented this nicely. A nicely done blueberry ale.
Portsmouth Bluebeery;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Portsmouth Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Clear reddish amber with a white head, served in a shaker with a dozen or so blueberries tossed in. Fresh, sweet blueberry nose and flavor, light sweet caramel. Far better than I expect from a beer like this.
Keltic Light;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Why make this? Bordering on colourless. Thick white head. Light pale malt aroma. No real hop aroma, thin body with a touch of noble hop flavour that is gone the second you go looking for it.
Keltic Light;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;The color is very pale and transluscent, it looks a lot like water. Very weak aroma and flavor of malt. Light body, watery texture, prickly carbonation.
Keltic Light;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Standard light lager. Lightly fruity aroma. Very pale gold colour with a thin diminishing white head. Mostly bland, slight sourness. Light bodied and watery.
Keltic Light;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Light Keltic Lager, this is clean and well-made, but far too light to be of interest to the hardcore beer geek. The biscuit and honey notes are still here, but the fruitiness is gone, replaced with wetness.
McCeols Irish Red;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Ok so I found one of these in the cellar. Likely 9 months old. Not a fair review since it’s way outdated but it’s just plain nasty, nuff said.
McCeols Irish Red;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Can. Dark copper with a medium frothy white head. The aroma is metallic and grainy with slight hints of DMS. Bland flavour profile - vegetal and doughy substance but quite watery otherwise. Uninteresting.
McCeols Irish Red;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;[155-20061221] 355mL. Smells like rancid butter mixed with an interesting floral honey characteristic. Deep yellow light orange body with no bubbles and a creamy white head. Same horrible floral flavour as in aroma. Light body. Can’t really get past the floral horror. (Tick.)
McCeols Irish Red;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Can shared with HogTownHarry, GregClow, jerc & mabel -- courtesy of jerc. Pours a clear amber-gold with an average size white head. Aroma of diactyl, garbage and old diapers -- just friggin’ awful. Flavour of watery garbage and diactyl. Light bodied. A ridiculously offensive beer.
McCeols Irish Red;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Bottle shared with HogTownHarry, blankboy, jerc & mabel - courtesy of jerc. Pale reddish-amber with a slightly unnatural looking off-white head. Aroma - oh, sweet Jesus, that’s rank! Like the sewage from Halifax Harbour mixed with cheap corn syrup. Flavour - thankfully not as bad as that aroma, but still no great shakes - thin malt with a cloying artificial tasting honey note, and a stale aftertaste. Oh, this is not good...
McCeols Irish Red;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;"Can (355ml). Shared with blankboy, GregClow, jerc and mabel, I forget who provided this ""treat"". Poured amber-gold with a frothy, cheap-looking white head. Mercifully light aroma of plastic, sugary grain, cardboard and an attempt at honey that I described as ""industrial honey"" ... and poo. Tasted sweet, grainy and stale - not as bad as the aroma, but lord, not good. Watery, stale, with an ugly aftertaste. Sorry to say it, but this is cheap, papery and worthless."
McCeols Irish Red;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Can. Sweet merciful crap that smells weird! Amber red body with a creamy off white head (3+). Filthy, rancid white wine aroma, notes of sea breeze, vegetal character and plastic. Watery dilute fruity white wine notes in the flavour, thin notes of honey and light grain. Thin bodied. I brought a six pack of this back from Nova Scotia since I never made it out to the brewpub. Needless to say I have five of these available if someone wants the rating.
McCeols Irish Red;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;355 mL can. Golden brown with small fizzy liht tan head with small whisps of lace. Aroma is sweet, slightly overripe fruit with some sour traces,mild grassy hoppy notes. Smooth drinking beer with a slightly crisp finsh, flavor is pretty uninteresting. overall.
McCeols Irish Red;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Deep golden colour, thick creamy head. A bit of fruit, caramel, and toasted malt aroma. Light yeasty fruitiness (cherry/berry). Warms to bring out even more of the cherry character. Nice decently sweet maltiness. A bit thin-bodied but definitely the best I tasted there.

McCeols Honey Brown;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Brown Ale;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Dark brown beer with a thin off-white head. Low aroma, some honey, a bit buttery. Some caramel but no real malt complexity (how did they get it so dark, without dark malts). Flavour is a bit toffeeish and diacetyl-laden. Pretty poor.
McCeols Honey Brown;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Brown Ale;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Coppery brown color with a ring of white lace. Mild aroma and flavor of malt and honey.
McCeols Honey Brown;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Brown Ale;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Light brown colour with a slight off-white head. Light caramel aroma and flavour with a touch of earthiness. Light bodied and somewhat watery.
McCeols Honey Brown;Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada;Brown Ale;Keltic Brewing Company Ltd.;Half the beers are named after the brewery, and the other half are named after the pub. McCeol's Honey Brown is the most interesting of them, with a lovely chestnut colour and a flavour that is sweetish, but not cloying. Rather, it has a well-developed light toffee profile that I quite enjoyed. The lightness is not surprising given the location, but I hope that they attempt something bigger and bolder down the road because the brewer seems to have quality technical skills.
Portsmouth Blitzen Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Other;Portsmouth Brewery;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a mostly dark amber/tan sort of color with a finger’s worth of quickly dieing white/off white head. Lace just slides into the beer. The aroma had some sweet wheat, light clove, nuts, nutmeg and then a sharp spruciness. The flavor tried to blend the sweet to the spice but ends up layering itself as it warms - sweet sometimes, spicy other times. Warming sweet wheaty/clove-like aftertaste and riding on into the finish. The feel had a contrast between the spicy harshness to the sweet smoothness as it didn’t seem to really want to meld together, once again like in the taste, yes, it’s separated. Sits between light and medium bodied. Overall, odd beer, not sure what else to say.
Portsmouth Blitzen Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Other;Portsmouth Brewery;Draught snifter at the brewpub, 12/27/2005. Deep amber-tan colored body, with some nut brown highlights and a small, poorly retained beige head, little to no lacing left behind. Mostly clear body. Aroma brings forth remnants of wheat, clove, alcohol, nuts, crystal malts and other spices (nutmeg perhaps). Rather sharp/poignant it seems to need a good dose of soothingly sweet malt to take the edge off. And the flavor is just the same. Hard candies (orange, apple, plum) with more clove and cinnamon and a warming sensation that grows quite acute by the finish. Hops are mostly bitter, lightly floral in flavor and quite drying, exacerbating the sharp alcohol and dry spices. Chewy wheat-like qualities seem at odds with the hard, papery crystal malts and light toasted graininess. The body is only medium, for all the flavors going on, both harsh and sweet, and the texture is lightly chewy at times, while warming gives it a bit of wateriness.
Portsmouth Blitzen Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Flavored - Other;Portsmouth Brewery;On tap at the brewpub: Berry candy and piney hops ooze a festive wooden sap...Citrus fruit latch on to cinnamon spiciness and important fruity caramel sweetness...Roasted malt bitterness roams in the back, but agrees with most present...An original pint of sweet and perfumy spiciness, but too sweet to be a quaffer...

Ambery brown colour with small off-white head. Aroma is sweetish malts along with some fruity and floral notes. Quite nutty and mildly spicy as well.

Youngs John Youngs Christmas Ale;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Young's;Bottle. Dark amber with a nice head. Both aroma and flavour has notes of malt, fruit, pumpkin and the most dominating is the aroma hops in this otherwise rather light and dry ale. The finish has a nice bitterness.

Sibirskaya Korona Rubinovoe;Omsk, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Omsk (AB InBev-Efes);Bottled. Amber colour, rich head. Dusty raisin aroma. Sweet and boldly malty with some syrup. Low bitterness. Simple but effective.
Sibirskaya Korona Rubinovoe;Omsk, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Omsk (AB InBev-Efes);Not much in the way of aroma. This feature was obviously not a priority. Orange/brown in color with an off-white, average-sized head that is somewhat lasting. Good lace. The relatively high 5.8% ABV is apparent. Roasted malt and molasses notes are also prevalent. Somewhat harsh aftertaste. Caramelly. Not bad. A little unrefined and has some of that characteristic Russian harshness. Still, I would choose this over most of the plethora of bland Russian lagers.
Baumgartner Stiftungsbier;Schärding, Austria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brauerei Josef Baumgartner AG;getrunken im November 2014 EIgentlich sollte dies ein Premium-BIer dieser Brauerei sein - erinnert aber eher an ein normales Märzen.

Golden, clear body, with a big, frothy, lacing, white head. Aroma of grains, old grass, cardboard, herbs, malt sweetness. Tastes of cardboard, grains, old grass, corn, some herbs, sweetness. Medium, a bit creamy mouthfeel, with a modedate carbonation. Finishes medium bitter, with cardboard, grains, grass. Boring and flat, with unpleasant cardboard notes. Not the worst Pale Lager I’ve had, but still quite far from an enjoyable beer.
Baumgartner Stiftungsbier;Schärding, Austria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brauerei Josef Baumgartner AG;bottle, Interspar Linz. Clear pale golden yellow, medium-sized white head. Malty nose. Malty, slightly fruity flavours with a touch of grain, pleasantly hoppy in the finish.

Trader Todds Adventure Beer Red;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;Aroma is faint but has a slight sour malt scent with tones of alcohol. Color is a light orange/brown with good carbonation and a thin head. Taste is watery and sour. Starting with a light/medium body it goes down thin with a slight fizzy feel. Finish comes on with a sour malt flavor that seems a bit washed out and watery. On the end it leaves you with a mild bitterness and slight metallic taste.
Trader Todds Adventure Beer Red;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;Had at the bar. It was better than expected. Copper color. Malt flavor, but not too sweet. A nice drinking little beer and by far the best beer in the place, mainly because they only had the Ogre Light, Corona, and Amstel Light, and probably some BMC junk.
Trader Todds Adventure Beer Red;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;It’s crap. It pours a pale, clear brownish-orange and has almost no head. It stinks - a mixture of old caramel and a cleanser. It tastes like stale candy and has no discernable hopping. This is nasty crap. Lunar Brewing Company, Villa Park, IL
Trader Todds Adventure Beer Red;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;Light red body with a fairly large white head. Aroma is cherries and a little bit of malt. The taste is sweet with tangerines and some cinnamon spice in the finish. Plenty of carbonation in the mouthfeel. This actually isn’t bad, but could ue a litle more body and a little less sweetness.
Trader Todds Adventure Beer Red;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;Had this one bottled. Beautiful deep red color. Very thin head that dissipated quite rapidly into a orangy film on the glass, very little nose, malty and somewhat bitter for a red, tasted remarkably similar to Rock Bottom’s red. Unremarkable.
Trader Todds Adventure Beer Red;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;Pour is definatly red with a head that says bye-bye quickly. Aroma is hard to detect and I can’t realy place it. Flavor is malty and bitter with no real qualities. Pretty poor.
Trader Todds Adventure Beer Red;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;copper color, head consists of a few bubbles around the edge of the glass. aroma has some lightly fruity malts. flavor is not much different, but has a serious cardboard quality to it. definitely wouldn’t buy this again.
Trader Todds Adventure Beer Red;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;You have every reason not to drink this beer, it is a stupid gimick, afterall. The release had the actor that played Ogre in Revenge of the Nerds doing in-store promotion! I didn’t bother pouring it in a glass. The body was much heavier than expected, I thought it was going to be an American Standard, but seemed to be a malty Dunkel. I was shocked to find some malty flavors and even some toastiness. Hint of dryness at the finish. Ok, so it’s not that bad!
Trader Todds Adventure Beer Red;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;"Bottle; More coppery than red, produced a fading head and no lace. The aroma is malty caramel and toast, pumpernickel bread, aromatic hops, light citrus, and metallic. The taste is straight foreward sweet malt with a minor bitter aftertaste. Does have a twangy finish which is the only thing that saves this from becoming a boring drainpour. The feel is fizzy, dry and metallic. Below average just another common attempt at the style."
Trader Todds Adventure Beer Red;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Minhas Craft Brewery;Draught at Trader Todd’s on Sheffield: transparent red. No head, but that doesn’t happen much when you are at a bar (most beer for your money I guess). . .I think this was a pretty fresh sample as there was a decent hop profile with some dry bitterness. I can’t say that this is a great beer but it was better than the alternative at every other bar. . .
Trader Todds Ogre Beer Lyte;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;I stopped at Sunsigner in Champaign, IL to get some Victory Storm King. I orded this one while waiting for my wife to eat. Like all light beers, this is watery. Unlike most light beers, it does not have tons of adjunct flavor. Caramel and malt stands out in the flavor. Although I have not had one in a while, this reminds me of a weaker version of Sam Adams light. This is a tolerable beer for being a light beer, but if you are going to watch your calories, drink a guinness.
Trader Todds Ogre Beer Lyte;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;"Bottled. Okay, so what it is is a light beer. The bottle says 115 calories. I will suggest that as a ""light,"" it’s pretty okay. A slightly toffee color instead of the usual pale straw. Nonexistent head, and a slightly hoppy smell. Not much in the taste, but it lacks the tin can taste of most lights, and is easier on the usual iron taste of most Huber beers. Fizzy, at least, but the finish gets kind of corny and watery. Had some promise in that it at least shows enough color to scare away most Division Street boyos. Found this single bottle on a shelf at United Liquors in Frankfort."
Trader Todds Ogre Beer Lyte;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;This was just not very good at all... Pour was a pale golden color with no head. The little bit of aroma there was was remniscent of stale candy. Light and flat mouthfeel. Slightly metallic flavor with little else in there. Watery finish.
Trader Todds Ogre Beer Lyte;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Had at the bar after a Cubs win. How can you not go to Ogres bar and not have his beer? Plus, the only other choices were the red, which I had, and BMC + Corona and Amstel Light. It was light in aroma, flavor, and color. Not bad for what it is. It seemed to have more flavor than a BMC light. It went well with the wings.
Trader Todds Ogre Beer Lyte;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Damn Todd, when’d you get a mullet? corn-y and some other indesipherable farm like flavors. like a stronger flavored bud light
Trader Todds Ogre Beer Lyte;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;damn, this is an interesting brew especially since the label rules, mulet style. bland amber look, mod head and it tastes like a dirt flavored amber, not a fan except for the mullet.
Trader Todds Ogre Beer Lyte;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Luckily I got one free can of this lastest nasty bit of contract brewing by the Huber folk. Headless pale gold and reaking of stale caramel corn, this fortunately had little flavor. Soft bodied, bereft of finish.
Trader Todds Ogre Beer Lyte;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Bottle. Practically no head when poured. No aroma at all, which I guess is better than a bad aroma. Golden clear color. Flat tasting. Tastes like a Miller Lite served in a glass of ice. Cool that it has Ogre on the label, but that novelty is the only reason to purchase.
Trader Todds Ogre Beer Lyte;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Nice golden color with decent lace and a lasting ring of head. That’s where the niceness ends. Seriously. Tthis beer blows. Sickly sweet, syrupy, sluggish palate. Drain pour.
Trader Todds Ogre Beer Lyte;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;A farily dark golden color. A decent amount of carbonation. A trace of a thin white head Aroma is a malty hint of grass and some carrots. Taste has metallic notes and celery. Not much else going on here. I can see why I got the individual bottle for $1.
Staffordshire Double Sunset;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Cask at The Green Dragon, Leek (JDW) 5% ABV. A clear golden colour with a medium white head. Aroma of grainy malts, yeast and subtle medicine notes. Taste of grainy malts, yeast, slight medicinal notes and subtle grass. Light bodied and soft carbonation. A dry, medicinal, slight band aid finish. This is got to be infected! They wouldn’t brew it like this?
Staffordshire Double Sunset;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Bottle from Asda, Telford. Golden with no head. Has a hoppy-sweetness to it, this is possibly the citrus within the ale as stated on the bottle, but the citrus itself is not overly obvious. What is more obvious is its bitterness, but this is also only mid-bitterness at best.
Staffordshire Double Sunset;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Clear golden, white head. Tangy aroma but not in a good way. Taste is a bit of citrus and some caramel. Inoffensive almost to the point of actually becoming offensive. Sherbety aftertaste. Meh.
Staffordshire Double Sunset;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Rating 3,900. 500ml bottle at 5%. Pours dark orange with a small head. Aroma is bready dried fruits. Taste has dried fruits throughout with a bready finish.
Staffordshire Double Sunset;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Cask at Johny’s Micro Bar, Burslem. Pours golden amber with an off white head. A malty low hop car crash of a beer.

Staffordshire Double Sunset;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Pours golden with little carbonation.

Staffordshire Double Sunset;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Bottle from Bier Huis. Pours golden with single finger white head. Aroma of hops, sweat, fruits, citrus. Taste of initial malts, bready, biscuity, then touches of fruit, light hops, tangy too. Not great.
Hauenstein Beer;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;Pint can pours a pale straw yellow with a large white head. Grassy hops malt and yeast aroma. Sweet malt taste with lager yeast and a hint of hops. A cheap drinkable lager perfect for art-a-whirl!
Hauenstein Beer;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;Pours a nice pale golden with one of the worst heads I’ve ever seen on a beer ever. We’re talking like where you get a cask ale and it shows up with a bunch of loose big bubbles on top.. .although the loose big bubbles on this one stick around… weird, just weird. The aroma is pleasant enough, grainy, a touch fruity, with some light sweetness and corniness. Decidedly not great, but inviting enough. Flavor is pretty quintessential pale lager, to the point where I really have to tip my hat to it. Really nicely balanced between grainy malt, mild corny adjuncts, and a pleasant hop bitterness and grassy flavor… all while keeping a mild but never overbearing sweetness… The palate is a touch flat, but not terribly thin, and the lower carbonation doesn’t seem to be too much trouble in the way of flavor and perception of the beer generally. What can I say? I would say that I would happily drink a few of these in an evening, but the truth is that I have, numerous evenings. It does’t hold the place in my heart that Point Special does, but it’s a damn good alternative to many pale lagers that are far more famous.
Hauenstein Beer;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;16 oz. can pours a pale yellow with small white head. Aroma is slighly grainy. Taste is a little on the sweet side with a bitter, slighly metallic finish. Body is light but not as watery as I expected. When I grew up not too far from New Ulm, MN, this was usually the cheapest beer to be had. I’m glad that Schell’s revived this old brand (a former competitor?). An average cheap lager, which still serves its purpose.

Hauenstein Beer;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;My dad bought this all the time because he found out I hated it and gave me a headache.

Hauenstein Beer;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;Can… Clear, light yellow lager with a small, fizzy, white head. The aroma is of piss, light pepper and a touch of skunky hops. Light to medium-bodied with tingly carbonation. Canned corn sweetness and very low bitterness. Thin and watery. No real balance. Watery, sweet corn finish.
Hauenstein Beer;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;Bottle, thanks to akevitt for sharing. Pours a very light pale yellow body with a thin white head. Light aroma of malt and not much else. Flavor is the same with a light corn sweetness. Light on the palate and very drinkable.

Leek Chopin;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);Bottle Conditioned. BBE July 2004. Initially a fairly fresh tasting and fragrant Golden Ale in a bottle. But all too soon the taste becomes a little too sharp throwing the whole thing off balance. A 4.3% Golden Ale in a bottle is perhaps just a bit too adventurous.
Leek Chopin;Leek, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Staffordshire Brewery (prev Leek);"Aromas are more spicy than malty (but the bottle says ""malty""). Reddish gold in colour but too pale to be malty, surely. Flavours are burnt something or other with a very dry finish. Where are the malts? Bah, Chop Sticks."
Archers Winter Warmer;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Porter;Evan Evans Brewery;"Slug and Lettuce, Leicester, 02/01/14. Aroma mellow and chocolate-lactic with berry and orange hints. Pale ruby with a firm cream collar draping the pot. Gentle smoked, slightly grilled meaty flavour with suggestions of hazelnut, praline, strawberry esters; peppercorn, a chew of date. Finishes with a mildly souring tang of redcurrant and oaky vinous touches. Low, generous condition. Complex, full and tasty."
Archers Winter Warmer;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Porter;Evan Evans Brewery;Cask @ Slug & Lettuce Leicester. Chestnut colour. Nutty malty beer with a dry hoppy taste with a little spice to it. I quite liked this. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Archers Winter Warmer;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Porter;Evan Evans Brewery;Cask conditioned at Far From the Madding Crowd, Oxford. Chestnut with white head. There is a dry nuttiness to this, hazelnut, chocolate malts, but is a little on the thin side, no real carry through for a winter warmer. Bordering on a bitter, but just remains under the Porter classification.
Archers Winter Warmer;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Porter;Evan Evans Brewery;Pale black beer with a coffee hopped aroma and a dryly hopped flavour. Overall a basic ale.
Lednicki Miód;Bielsko Biala, Poland;Mead;TiM (Nectar Polska);Pour is ruddy amber color...smell is strongly sweet with some faint hints of pepper...some alcohol too...thick chewy mouthfeel...nice and lightly sweet with hints of pepper...nice...
Lednicki Miód;Bielsko Biala, Poland;Mead;TiM (Nectar Polska);Pours clear bronze with no head. The aroma has roasted honey, slick abv warmth and some rubbing alcohol. Medium / full velvety smooth body. The taste starts with smooth nectarine and honey along with some white grapes. The finish is sharper and has more of a vineous flavor with light warmth. This is an enjoyable mead that goes down exceptionally easy for the high alcohol content. Recommended.
Lednicki Miód;Bielsko Biala, Poland;Mead;TiM (Nectar Polska);Seems thicker than other meads that I’ve had thus far. Nice, deep golden amber body. The aroma’s honey sweet with wood, nuts, and apples blended in. Same with the flavor, although the alocohol presence is more pronounced. Sticky sweet finish. Not too shabby. Binny’s Beverage Depot, Orland Park, IL
Lednicki Miód;Bielsko Biala, Poland;Mead;TiM (Nectar Polska);Sampled at Polish Fest in Milwaukee. The mead pours to a pancake syrup colored body. The aroma is interesting. I swear it smells like port wine mixed with sweet honey. The flavor is sweet port wine-ish with hints of oak and honey. The palate is sweet, sticky, interesting.
Lednicki Miód;Bielsko Biala, Poland;Mead;TiM (Nectar Polska);Uncorking releases a pleasant scent of apples before a deep copper/whisky colored pour. Alcohol features prominently as brandy in the aroma with additional Bit O’ Honey and wooden notes. Flavor is somewhat harsh, with peaty bitterness in accompaniment to the alcohol... yet it is enriched with the fruity sweetness of honey-apple. Lightly syruped in body but thinner than I would truly enjoy. Mildly burning to the gullet further showcasing some rough edges. A bit unrefined, but still well worth the price. Binnys Beverage Depot/DiCarlo’s Armanetti, Willowbrook, IL 60527
Lednicki Miód;Bielsko Biala, Poland;Mead;TiM (Nectar Polska);Fort Wayne Mead Tasting. This bottled mead poured a small almost non-existent head of clear fine to large sized bubbles that left behind a dark brown transparent uncarbonated body. The aroma was very nice with a strong malt caramel honey note. The flavor was also very strong with honey and other unnoted flavors that were well balanced and made the mead very good over all. An excellent mead that is well recommended.
Lednicki Miód;Bielsko Biala, Poland;Mead;TiM (Nectar Polska);Dark reddish brown. Nose is sweet with honey and floral notes and a little whiff of cognac. Medium bodied and definitely quite sweet. Some fruity notes, cherry maybe and a hint of spice. A solid Polish mead.
Lednicki Miód;Bielsko Biala, Poland;Mead;TiM (Nectar Polska);At the Ft. Wayne Mead tasting. Thanks to hotstuff and thedm for sharing several meads. This Lednicki is a delicious liquid. Still out of the bottle with a redish amber color. Nose of floral honey, leather and decaying wood. Honey mouthfeel with stone fruit sweetness, and a sherry alcohol sense to it. Definitely my favorite of the night, but still not as good as the Apis Jadwiga.
Lednicki Miód;Bielsko Biala, Poland;Mead;TiM (Nectar Polska);Fort Wayne Mead Tasting. The final mead of the nite. Red in color with no head but that was expected. A wonderful vanilla and honey aroma. Honey taste with hints of vanilla and fruits. Wow, this was really tasty. Them Polish people sure do make a mean mead.
Lednicki Miód;Bielsko Biala, Poland;Mead;TiM (Nectar Polska);750ml. bottle at Fort Wayne Mead Tasting last night. No head poured, transparent, uncarbonated, and an orange hue. Aroma was sweet, slight honey note, and alcohol. Sweet, honey flavor. Delicious! Vinuous mouthfeel, yet smooth. A very good mead IMO and well worth trying.
Lompoc Holiday Cheer;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Lompoc Brewing;Tap @ Lompoc’s Side Bar... Poured deep, almost black with a tan head that retained nicely. Aroma had roast, cocoa powder, and toffee. Big time malty, chocolate, vanilla and even a bit of fruits and yeast flavor before a chard, oaky finish.
Lompoc Holiday Cheer;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Lompoc Brewing;Not a traditional winter ale, because its a porter! Quite good. Vanilla is present in the body. Strong notes of malt, for a smooth drink.
Lompoc Holiday Cheer;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Lompoc Brewing;Drat at the NW location in Portland... Soft black with nice white head. Aromas of chocolate and a large amount of vanilla. smooth/ not too over carbonated. a masterpiece of a porter.
Lompoc Holiday Cheer;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Lompoc Brewing;Draft at the brewpub. Sort of a cherry, berry, roasted malt aroma. Color is brownish mahogony, with a beige, lacing head. Medium body and carbonation. Flavor is smooth roasted malt, with a nearly kiwi or strawberry aspect.
Lompoc Holiday Cheer;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Lompoc Brewing;At Hedge House in Portland--8.3% 2007 batch--Deep, dark opaque black-mahogany with a lavish thin and rocky beige head that dissipated. Great creamy lace curtain. Faint coffee and vanilla nose. Rich vanilla creamy crisp mouth feel with waves of chocolate.
Lompoc Holiday Cheer;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Lompoc Brewing;Draught at restaurant. Dark orange with tan head. Not reminiscent of porters I’m used to. Hoppy aroma. Creamy body with much hoppiness. This is really more like a winter ale than a porter. It’s a good winter ale.
Lompoc Holiday Cheer;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Lompoc Brewing;Dark orange and brown with a medium sized tan head. Has a soft creamy spiced aroma of nutmeg, pine, apple cider and plums. Big malt presence, with lots of dark cherries and plums in the flavor.
Mia and Pias Holiday Mint Stout;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;"Sampled @ New Old Lompoc, December 2003 - Just beneath pitch black. Nice creamy brown head. Big sugary chocolate mint nose. Smells pretty good, very ""Holiday""-like. Smell like a nice dark mint chocolate candy, not artificial or detatched at all. Creamy and thick, with rich dark chocolate flavors and only a mild mint presence, which is nice. Sweet and smoky finish with bourbon like alcohol present. This stuff is goooood."
Paddys Pub Frost Biter;Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Paddys Pub & Rosies Restaurant;Dark ruby tinged amber with a moderate off white head (3+). Sweet malty aroma with fruity notes (raspberry? blackberry?) and mild hints of alcohol. Dry malty flavour with mild notes of caramel and dark malt, dry touch of alcohol in the finish. Average palate. Pleasant but not much to distinguish it.
Paddys Pub Frost Biter;Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Paddys Pub & Rosies Restaurant;Tawny amber with an earthy, carmelly, fruitcakey aroma. Sweet palate with caramelly flavour initially. Gives way to an English hop signature.
Silver City Fat Scotch Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Silver City Brewery;As I drank this beer and the sip moved from the top of my tongue to the back of my mouth, layer upon layer of malty flavor unfolded. It was a mind blowing experience.
Silver City Fat Scotch Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Silver City Brewery;09-Jun-13 (1-liter swing-top bottle: $5.79 at Bottleworks in Seattle, WA) Okay, this bottle of Fat Bastard has been cellaring for several years and it's certainly on its downward slope, but the essence is still here. It's richly malty, toasty, moderately sweet, and very caramely with lots of toffee, some cola and prune, a hint of smoky earth, and no bitterness. The malty aromas are sweet and caramely, but also darker in character than the flavor with more molasses, prune, cola, and maple syrup. As expected for the style, it's full bodied and very sweet, becoming cloying after awhile. Carbonation is light-medium, and there's a touch of acidity in the background. Clear, medium-dark brown in color with mahogany edges. The tan head only pours to a quarter inch before settling to a thin ring. Overall, a pretty classic Scotch Ale from an American brewery, but yeah, I should have gotten to this beer sooner. Still good though.
Silver City Fat Scotch Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Silver City Brewery;Draft at the Seattle Taproom at SeaTac airport. Nose is vanilla caramels, honey, and a hint of floral. Hazy amber brown with a small beige head. Flavor is lightly sweet and malty with only the slightest hint of bitter. Awesome to find something this tasty at an airport.
Silver City Fat Scotch Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Silver City Brewery;Strong with sweet brown sugar flavors. Pours amber with a light head. Bitter after taste.
Silver City Fat Scotch Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Silver City Brewery;Aromas are fairly traditional for a Scotch ale dark malt a hint of roast barest hint of peat a little toffee and molasses. Flavors are like nose with a bit of metallic peat is hard to find and sweet dominates. Body is okay with a bit of chalk okay carbonation. Finishes all right.
Silver City Fat Scotch Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Silver City Brewery;Pours a dark brown with thick tan head. Smokey, rich caramel, and bitter flavors.
Silver City Fat Scotch Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Silver City Brewery;Dark fruit and malt smell. Pours a deep, deep red. Strongly caramel in flavor. Tasty, but very sweet. Compared to other scotch ales, it tastes a bit light on the bittering, though I agree that the smoky peatiness is obvious.
Silver City Fat Scotch Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Silver City Brewery;Keg tap at the Junkyard, Nottingham. Light brown and quite translucent with a film of khaki head. Toast, molasses, hazelnut in the aroma. Taste is sweet, very nutty, slightly smoky, with a gentle leafy hop bitterness providing some dryness to the finish. More hazelnut and touches of prune and coffee in the aftertaste. Great example of the style.
Silver City Fat Scotch Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Silver City Brewery;"Tap at the Junkyard. Pours dark chestnut with ruby lights and tan halo lace. Aroma is richly malted dark fruits burnt toffee and a hint of peat. Taste is medium to full sweet with a bitter background. Palate is medium bodied +, sticky texture, light carbonation, and a caramel swirl of a finish. Very nice indeed. Wonder why they dropped the""bastard"" in the name?"
Silver City Fat Scotch Ale;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Silver City Brewery;Had this at taproom in seattle airport. With sweetness from caramelized flavor, and maltiness. I have less experience in scotch ales, but this tastes like middle of belgian red ales and stouts.

Brasseurs de Lorraine Loroyse Biere Blonde;Pont-a-Mousson, France;Tripel;Les Brasseurs de Lorraine;Bottle from Bottle Barn in Santa Rosa, CA. Pours clear copper with a slight white head. Caramel aroma. Med + body. Flavor is lightly sweet caramel, a touch of yeast and some pale stone fruits. It's mildly bitter to go with the caramel. Not the usual Tripel I'd say, but the taste is decent.

Brasseurs de Lorraine Loroyse Biere Blonde;Pont-a-Mousson, France;Tripel;Les Brasseurs de Lorraine;Delicious beer! Very well put together. It does have a sweet flavor to it.

A signaler une médaille d’or ""best of France"" au WBA. Couleur doré un peu ambré, à la clarté nette. Bulles très fines, à montée lente. Mousse beige clair, soyeuse, stable à 2 mm. Arômes d’un malt pils, balle de blé, avoine, pointe de coriandre, prune blanche et même mirabelle (nous sommes en Lorraine !!). 1ère bouche très souple, soyeuse, sur un malt pils, et une pointe de cerise bigarreau. Arrière-bouche avec une amertume très simple mais sympathique. 2ème à la grande douceur, mais qui va jusqu’au manque de personnalité... Arrière-bouche qui s’efface très vite. 3ème qui tombe encore d’un cran .. Elle me fait penser à une vieille pils luxembourgeoise. Arrière-bouche soft.

Alcool qui ne fait pas son niveau, et ne soutient aucunement la longueur. Finale effacée.

St Peters Brewery Cinnamon Girl;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Other;St Peters Brewery (Australia);I’m just updating my records.Given to me as a gift. Not a big fan...........
St Peters Brewery Cinnamon Girl;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Other;St Peters Brewery (Australia);It’s a mystery to me that this total misfire is still in production nine years after its first dismal reviews here. Time has done nothing to improve it. Mud-brown with a thin head. Smells like a basic pale ale - perhaps a pinch of cinnamon but you have to draw pretty deep to find it. Thin, fizzy body. The base ale is skinny, with sweet commercial lemonade notes. But it’s the grabby, astringent finish that kills it. It’s like gargling a solution of cinnamon and lemonade. You could achieve the same effect by buying any cheap industrial lager and sprinkling it with way too much cinnamon. Truly dreadful. (640ml bottle that was a gift from the father-in-law and mostly went down the drain.)
St Peters Brewery Cinnamon Girl;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Other;St Peters Brewery (Australia);draught at paddys beerfest. Pours a murky copper/brown, with a small beige head. aroma is chocolate and light cinnamon. Flavours of chocolate, caramel and a light cinnamon aftertaste. decent and drinkable, looking at the bottle ratings there may be a significant difference between bottle and draught.
St Peters Brewery Cinnamon Girl;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Other;St Peters Brewery (Australia);Bottle. Murky brown with a huge dense head. Subtle aromas of cinnamon and a little malt sweetness. Would have loved a huge cinnamon hit here. Flavours are all over the place. Some malt sweetness, a little cinnamon and some other spices I cant place. Not agreat beer.
St Peters Brewery Cinnamon Girl;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Other;St Peters Brewery (Australia);"Bottle - Yet again half of the bottle fizzed over the lip of the bottle and ran down the sink, not a bad thing. Pours a hazy light brown, with a head that initially over flowed a 425ml shaker which was less than 1/10th full of beer! Raw mash aroma, with a very mild hint of cinnamon; interstingly there was a stronger smell of cinamon on my hands from the overflow off the bottle. Not much flavour to talk about,maybe a bit of malt,but the only thing that I really got was a metallic tinge for an aftertaste."
St Peters Brewery Cinnamon Girl;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Other;St Peters Brewery (Australia);"Bottle (640ml) 5%. I first saw this stuff down Camperdown cellars but was unable to buy as it hadn’t been entered into the system yet. I was “unlucky” enough to purchase it from Plonk cellars (Canberra), I would have been better off spending my money on pale larger as it would have been a better investment. Poured a muddy chocolate brown with a huge rocky, off-white head, which grew with time after the initial pour; after a minute or 2 it settled into a small creamy head which was average lasting. Aroma had very strong sulfuric notes (similar to the green star), with notes of all spice (certainly not cinnamon), acidic notes and some sweet bready malts hiding beneath. Flavor was a real mess I was shocked that a beer could taste worse than the Green Star, but St Peters really outdid themselves on this one; virtually no bitterness, strange sour/acidic notes, some all spice, strong notes of burnt plastic and a metallic finish. Light bodied with lively carbonation, dry mouthfeel, watery texture and a bad finish. Truly one of the worst beers I have tried and not only is it awful but it’s a complete rip-off of the Spiced ale range from St Peters in England."
St Peters Brewery Cinnamon Girl;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Other;St Peters Brewery (Australia);motel says it all better than i could hope to. bit of a mess. garam masala more than cinnamon, too much India in the pale ale.
St Peters Brewery Cinnamon Girl;Sydney, Australia;Flavored - Other;St Peters Brewery (Australia);a few people at the nags complained that this was undrinkable. i could see their point. it didn't taste much of cinnamon or of girl, tasted more like a failed batch of pale ale that the brewer decided to shove a few spices in and hope to cover up the mess. murky brown, acidity that shouldn't be there, hint of ginger overwhelmed by compost

Kingston Lager;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);"Bottle no thanks to Daniel Warren Rowland. I don’t really know his middle name so I made one up. This beer sucks. No doubt about it. Clear straw color, no head. Aroma is skunked with metallic grains. Flavor is just as shitty. Ugh. I drank a quarter of this and then made fun of my friends; because they still had yet to drink their portion. Suckers...."
Kingston Lager;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);355mL bottle into a rocks glass in Jamaica, mon. Well, this smells like the funky skunky... and not in a good way, mon - no jammin’. Tastes like skunky monkey, sweet bread, and burnt hair. Super high carbonation. Terrible.
Kingston Lager;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);"Thanks Dad..... now say that phrase as sarcastically as possible - like Bart and Lisa Simpson would. What a shit ass beer! Just stunk right from the pour. This will be flushed immediately. The beauty of this total crap beer is that I know it’s fresh cause my parents just brought it back from Jamaica. This is what it smells and tastes like fresh (and I can only imagine how brutal this is not fresh): Aroma: stank ass stank stank, skunk and then pee... and I’ll have to specify here and say that it can be no other than skunk pee or the pee of a bloated skunk corpse on the side of the road that has just been popped by the tires on a tractor. Maybe this more closely resembles the odor of the perfume that a dirty, meth addicted prostitute would ""freshen"" up with. Chemicals and, well, I just can’t describe this smell as it is putrid and has absolutely no resemblance to a beer. The taste is hardly beer either with dust, very slight sweetness - what the hell did they brew this mess with? Molted dreadlocks? It’s horrible! It is, however, more drinkable than smellable - yes, smellable. I just invented that word. Brutally foamy, thin and a - wait!! what is this? a... a..... a malty finish? Can it be? Kill these people for producing this ghastly disaster."
Kingston Lager;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Not much to this- a typical thin bodied, slightly grainy and watery Carribean beer with little real nose or flavor, except for the lime squeezed into it. However, I was drinking this at a little outside bar in Ocho Rios last week, while enjoying a nice cigar. This no doubt affected my perception of this beer somewhat....how could anything be too bad at that point?
Kingston Lager;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);WOW this was bad. Bottle from Jamica brought back by father. Aroma is cornish sweet and grainy, hints of some kind of chiomically bitterness. Taste is a similar big mess of a thing and the carbonation is incredible, quite hard to drink actually.
Kingston Lager;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);10.14oz bottle I really don’t have much to say about this lager. It poured a golden body…. The nose had sweet malty notes of honey, rosewater, and some tart rotten lemon. It was just a boring Caribbean lager, almost like drinking a Coors Original.
Kingston Lager;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);"I'll echo Oakes' comment - this has rather limited appeal. Almost all of these ""American Standard"" beers are starting to taste the same to me."
Kingston Lager;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Smells slightly skinky without being offensive. Almost has that familiar cheap lager aroma. Nothing wrong with the appearance, light fold with thin white film head. Carribean or cheap-hop flavour. Raw and thin at the same time. Bad vegetable flavour and sour finish.
Kingston Lager;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Desnoes and Geddes (Diageo PLC);Golden colour with a mostly diminishing white frothy head. Grassy aroma. Virtually tasteless, with a very light hint of a bitter finish. Despite looking very carbonated, mouthfeel is very soft, almost like it melts in your mouth. Or like it was never there.
Bertrams Savage India Pale Ale;Salmon, Idaho, United States;IPA;Bertrams Brewery and Restaurant;Sampled at the brewpub in Salmon, Idaho. In the tasting glass, a golden amber with an off-white head and good lacing rings. Nose of citrus and pine. Medium body. Flavor is mild for an IPA and I thought it was a pale ale until I read the description. Finishes with moderate bitterness. The difference between American Pale Ale is pretty subtle these days but if you toss in a lot of hops it seems OK to me to call your beer an IPA if you want to. Easy drinking and enjoyable and that is what counts.
Bertrams Savage India Pale Ale;Salmon, Idaho, United States;IPA;Bertrams Brewery and Restaurant;Grint from brewery. Medium amber, small foamy head. Aroma is caramel and soap. Tadste too is almost dank, but sweet, the bitter. Kind of weird.
Bertrams Savage India Pale Ale;Salmon, Idaho, United States;IPA;Bertrams Brewery and Restaurant;Growler pours out a copper golden topped with a white head. Nose is nice light pine citrus hops. Taste is more of the nice light pine citrus hops and a cereal malt.
Bertrams Savage India Pale Ale;Salmon, Idaho, United States;IPA;Bertrams Brewery and Restaurant;Tap @ BP. Copper color with a thin ring of sandy head. Not much in the nose, sort of grassy with a faint floral hop presence. Up front the taste is sweet, with bready malt and a light citrus hop. Some floral hops in the tail helps the finish bring a little bite, but it’s a pretty tame IPA.

Pours a slight hazy reddish amber brew with a thick and heavy off-white head that has excellent retention. Aroma of citrus peel, some orange zest and light caramel malt. Taste is smooth, thick and chewy with a bitter orange and caramel malt flavor. Finish is slightly sweet with a good balance of malt and bitter aftertaste.

Bull & Bush Man-Man Double IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;July 3rd, 2015 - The beer names here at Bull and Bush are starting to get to me, now that I'm moving on to the Man Man. A nice auburn and brunette beer, the thimble it comes in doesn't allow any head to develop. But a well placed nostril detects strawberry and cream on the nose, alongside some cherry pie. The flavor manifests these aromas with some strength and off-flavors, including cough medicine, but also the more appealing port. The aftertaste is delicious in contrast, with deep cherry flavors including maraschino, honey and a heavy alcohol burn. For those of you who have enjoyed Queen Anne's cherries, there's a lot of similarities here.
Bull & Bush Man-Man Double IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;Tap@ bull. Clear light amber color with ivory foam.  Bready, nutty, citrus, light buttery aromas. Sweet grainy pale malt base brew with citrus, pine hoppage---buttery finish___
Bull & Bush Man-Man Double IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;Hazy dark amber with a thin foamy head. Nose is amazing with notes of sticky toffee, earthy nuts, and piney hop resin with a light bubblegum tone. Like a toffee beery blow pop. Flavor is rich and malty and complex and nutty and boozy and just...right. Lots of pecan and toffee tones with a lovely backing sweetness. Subtle bitter tones with a little grassy hop cone flavor. Nice warm booziness to bring back the boozy toffee nuttiness. So dang lovely.
Bull & Bush Man-Man Double IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, brewed again in honor of their 42nd Anniversary. Pour is deep amber with a small cream-colored head and decent lacing. Sweet malty, lightly caramelly, grapefruit, orange peel, somewhat spicy, a hint of alcohol, and bready aroma. Taste is big bitter fruit peels, grapefruit heavy hops, sweet caramel, toasted bread, spicy hops, earthy, and cracker with a medium bitter finish. Sticky mouthfeel with high carbonation. Not a bad beer, but definitely not what you would expect from a DIPA, but the alcohol is hidden very well.
Bull & Bush Man-Man Double IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;On tap at the bull and bush, Dark brown and off-color for a DIPA. The smell is some hops but again deviates from the style. The flavor was strong sweet fruityness and it really doesn’t fit the style. The one thing this beer has going for it is that it really does taste like a double man beer, just not a double IPA. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 05-18-2008 22:09:24
Bull & Bush Man-Man Double IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;served at the brewpub in a goblet. feeling rather like a night at the round table with the british facade. Dark brown redish clear hue. Tan off white head and a slightly hoppy nose to follow. Pretty nice in the mouth feels like theres a pretty decent abv here, slight ember. A bit sweet caramel flavors and hoppy rose buds nicely rounded and good.

Bull & Bush Man-Man Double IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;"Draft in a tulip at the brewpub, 9/11/06: Midnight red with an eruption of tan foam; not much of an aroma, surprisingly, because this is soup-thick with a warming richness, almost like an eisbock more than an IPA. Doesn’t hold a candle to Great Divide’s Titan, but this is good."
Bull & Bush Man-Man Double IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;MMmmm, this was almost candy sweet! Lots of flavor, huge amounts of hops and a rich double sweet and tasty malt profile. Lots of rich citrus and grapefruit, and a lip numbing bit of fresh pine needles. Lots of pie crust maltiness, that just melts and matches perfectly with the hops. This is a huge beer to be that well balanced, but it is. This is one of the best of this style that I have ever tried.
Bull & Bush Man-Man Double IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;I had this at the Bull & Bush Pub, what a great place! It was super dark amber with a tiny tan head and it smelled of hops and burnt caramel (and feet). The flavor was of malt and major hops. I don’t know if I’m ready for a beer this big. I better stick with the Man Beer.

Actually reminded me of the Jolly Pumpkin offerings I had, most closely Oro de Calabaza.

McNeill's Scotch Ale;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;McNeill's Brewery;"Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a ruddy burnt orange to amber color with a fairly quick dissipating head. Mild lace. The aroma had some quickly leaving smoke and peat. Caramel malts and some burnt toast. Slight ash. The flavor has the ash up front and then the burnt toast. Smoke and peat are somewhat there. Burnt toast aftertaste. Burnt malty finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body and has an okay sessionability about it. Mild carbonation is felt. Overall, better than last beer but pretty much an ""up and down"" sort of beer. This one struggles to stay ahead with the forerunners of it’s style."

Tindall Mild;Bungay, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Tindall Ales;Rare mild tick at the Fat Cat, Norwich. This version weighs in at 3.7%. It pours darkest brown with a tiny off-white head. The aroma is earthy, gravel, wood, dirt, molasses and damp leaves. The taste is rustic, bitter - sweet, molasses, dark fruits, malt loaf, earth, leather, charred wood and spice. Finish is dry and earthy. Light + body and soft carbonation. Has a sort of rustic charm to it. Decent mild.

Tindall Mild;Bungay, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Tindall Ales;Bottled. Brown with absolutely no conditioning or head at all. True enough mild aroma but the flavour is a perhaps a little thin, even for a mild. Nice if you quaff it though, so perhaps ok after all. Short to moderate bitter finish.

Tindall Alltime;Bungay, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tindall Ales;A chestnut coloured beer with a reddish tint. Very little carbonation - almost completely flat. Soft malt aroma, with a hint of tropical fruit (melon?) in the background. Much the same on the palate, with the fruity, slightly resinous, hops coming through on the finish. My main problem with this beer was the mouthfeel. Dull, a bit thin and sweet. No noticeable bitterness and not a lot of presence. It doesn’t have enough bite for a hoppy bitter or sufficient weight for a malty one. Consequently, it falls a little uncomfortably between two stools. 500ml bottle from Memorable Cheeses, Ipswich.
Tindall Alltime;Bungay, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tindall Ales;Quite a flat pouring brown beer with a light roasted aroma and a general carmel hopped flavour. Overall quite a plain bitter.

Willoughby Wenceslas Christmas Ale;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Willoughby Brewing Co.;Aroma of mixed spices, I’m able to pick out the cinnamon and clove. Pours a clear red with a nice off white head. Slightly sweet taste, very malt forward. The spices come together quickly after the first taste and linger on the palate for a while. A nice addition to the other Ohio Christmas spiced ales.

Willoughby Wenceslas Christmas Ale;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Willoughby Brewing Co.;Willoughby Brewing Company .: Wenceslas Christmas Ale :. Pint Tap APPEARANCE: A deep dark ruby red, nearly black without serious light behind it. Thick off white head with really nice clinging lacing. AROMA: Malty notes with hints of orange and spice, a sweet smell. FLAVOR: This beer starts off with a solid malt backbone that quickly gives way to hints of orange, some honey sweetness and finishes off with noticeable spice, mostly cinnamon and some nutmeg. PALATE: A medium bodied beer unbelievably smooth and clean with a spicy almost dry finish. Very flavorful and just a touch sweet, with a well hidden alcohol heat. NOTES: I could pound growlers of this, but the 7.0% ABV would surely catch up quick. There is so little alcohol heat, what I did pick up was mild and only really showed once the beer started to warm up a bit. I think that this beer really opens up with a little warmth.
Willoughby Wenceslas Christmas Ale;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Willoughby Brewing Co.;"On tap at brewpub **Summary** - With Willoughby back to their normal lineup of beers the pickings were very slim. If this trend of few interesting taps keeps up I can see myself driving up there less. This was the most interesting option and a halfway decent beer by the time I got to the end of the pint. **Aroma / Appearance** - There was not much headspace available as the glass came filled almost to the brim. The liquid inside was a deep maroon and fluid. Spiced plum, dark malts, cherry, and tea leaf melded into a clean blend of experiences that was almost like spiced cider. **Flavor / Palate** - Medicinal taste ruin what I was hoping would be a nice time. Cherry pie and dark chocolate are the most obvious aspects. The ABV is hidden well; this goes down very smoothly. Decent but not amazing this is a solid alternative from a respectable brewpub."
Willoughby Wenceslas Christmas Ale;Willoughby, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Willoughby Brewing Co.;Very pretty deep brown body. The head was there when I go the beer, I blinked and it was gone. Very festive aromoa, I could definately smell nutmeg and clove. This a pretty well bodied beer. the nose has enough hop to keep you interested with the clove and other flavors to let you know it is for this time of year. then finish is a little thinner then the I had expected. Not much after taste.
Ellicott Mills Oz Wit;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Ellicott Mills Brewing;Amber, orange appearance with a small head. Fruity, spicy aroma. Medium-bodied flavor from the wheat and rye ingredients. Fruits and spices dominate the taste up front but disappear in the finish. Mild, smooth aftertaste.
Ellicott Mills Oz Wit;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Ellicott Mills Brewing;Drinking this beer I'm convinced the brewer could put out a nice witbeer if he tried, but I'm not sold on the Australian attempt. The beer has a nice fruity taste, with a creamy mouthfeel. The aftertaste is crisp and watery, and the hops just don't taste right. I'm not sure if it's psychological or not, but it has an aftertaste of cheap pils... A letdown after the wonderful initial bite.
Ellicott Mills Oz Wit;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Ellicott Mills Brewing;Well, I'd never heard of an Australian style wit beer before, so I decided to give this a shot. The appearance is, frankly, not too inviting. A murky dark yellow color with a decent, but sickly colored, head. The scent, however, was very enticing. The aroma was sweet, spicey, and surprisingly woody. The beer was smooth on the tongue with hints of corrander and citrus flavors blending well with the expected wheat elements. Australian hopps were very noticeable. Overall, a very drinkable offering.
Stoddards Holiday Scotch Ale;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Stoddards Brewhouse;Tap. A dark ruby color with a sweet vanilla and toasted malt flavor. Hints of brandy throughout.

City Steam White Rabbit;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;City Steam Brewery;On tap @ City Steam. Pours hazy straw yellow with a small, white head. Nose is candied citrus, orange peel, very slight spice. Very syrupy sweet. Flavor is similar: sugar explosion: sugary sweetness in citrus, orange peel, and banana. Not much spice in the flavor, but cloyingly sweet. Soft carbonation and a medium body combine in this nice summer beer. I like sweetness, but this was almost too much for me.
City Steam White Rabbit;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;City Steam Brewery;Tap @ the pub. Light yellow color with a huge white head. Wheaty lemon notes with just a hint of spice. Wheaty citrus flavor. Light body.
City Steam White Rabbit;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;City Steam Brewery;On tap at City Steam. Pours a super light yellow with a small white head. Aroma of light spices, clove, and ginger. Flavor is pretty spicy, with lots of garlic and grassy hops, some old fish. Weak-bodied with no malt backbone behind the heavy spices. Not a good beer.
City Steam White Rabbit;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;City Steam Brewery;Tap. Aroma quite spicy, gingery, sprucy, grassy. Very little there in the flavor, only thing mildly interesting continues to be the spice aspect, but it is much more subdued than in the aroma. Not much here.
City Steam White Rabbit;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;City Steam Brewery;Cloudy yellow, 1cm white head. Wheaty, tart aroma with a fair dose of crushed coriander seeds. Sweet and almost crusty in its wheatiness. Desserty witbier. High carbonation, light-bodied. Straightforward orangey notions. Soft, but not very refreshing at all. And frankly what is the point of a wheat beer if it does not refreshes its drinker.
City Steam White Rabbit;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;City Steam Brewery;In short: An average generic banana/coriander witbier. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Cloudy yellow body with a small white head In long: A lot of coriander on the nose. Taste is coriander and bananas nose to nose. Wet hay/straw body. Some honey. Salty/minerals finish dry the mouth. A bit too much coriander and bananas for the long run. Nothing wrong with the beer but it was boring me. Generic and forgettable. One witbier makes you grimace And one witbier makes you smile And the ones that City Steam serves you Don’t do anything at all
City Steam White Rabbit;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;City Steam Brewery;My Bottom Line: Coriander seeds aplenty dominate this proper Witbier, as honeyed bananas provide further enjoyment. Very drinkable, perfumy, and well-structured, this is a textbook example of this estival style. Further Personal Perceptions: -A slice of foam decorates the cloudy whitish yellow. -Doughy yeast accompanies the orangey fruitiness. -The coriander seeds are ubiquitous and may bother those who are not especially fond of their fruity spiciness. -This was not a memorable Witbier by any means, but I thought it served its purpose admirably. On tap at the brewpub.
City Steam White Rabbit;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;City Steam Brewery;Tap at the source - Lightly hazed gold, creamy white head. Nose held soft notes of orarnge zest and corriander, with underlying notes of banana and yeast as it hit room temp. Very well balanced flavors of citrus and spice that tangle with light yeasty notes late. Light to medium bodied, soft carbonation, spiced finish. Well done summer thirst quencher...
City Steam White Rabbit;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;City Steam Brewery;A very nice beer with an appearance typical of witbiers. This was my first one on draft at the pub and the malty-orange-wheat base was somewhat rich for a basic witbier (not quite like a tripel, but better than a wit). Finished with a nice spicey (coriander?) hoppiness. Would enjoy trying this one again.

City Steam Paris Porter;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Porter;City Steam Brewery;Light brown in color with a thin off white head.Aroma is of chocolate ,nuts,fruit and roasted malts.

City Steam Belle Dock #4;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;City Steam Brewery;Draught in a snifter: This one poured a dark, cloudy mahogany color. There was pretty much no head on it at all. The aroma contained malt sweetness, as well a some fruitiness. Maybe a int of an unknown spice. The taste was sweet, but mellowed: not harsh like some Barleywines can be. There was also a hint of oakiness to the taste. Also, a bit of an alcohol taste coming through, but it didn't detract from it one bit. Very good!
City Steam Belle Dock #4;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;City Steam Brewery;Has a dark red/ruby color and a sweet malt smell. Taste was also of sweet malts and finished very smooth with little bitterness. Overall one of the best barley wines I have tried.

Walkabout St. Outback Stout;Central Point, Oregon, United States;Stout;Walkabout Brewing;Draft at the Horse Brass Pub in Portland. Black as night. Smoky and sweet chocolate and tobacco in the nose, with some cherries and a strong coffee presence. Very rich and creamy, with an overpowering coffee flavor, just too much really. A big, hearty, black-as-death stout with an awesome sweet flavor, but too much coffee.

Tarnea Bière du Tarn;Aucamville, France;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Les Frères Brasseurs;Pale ale with almost no head. The aroma is slightly hoppy, fruity and metalic. Taste is very faint. Watery. Seems like a faint version of Tolosa. It reminds me of cheap mexican beer. I hate to say this, but this beer is really uninteresting.
Kopparbergs Special Brew Super X-Strong 10.0%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Malt Liquor;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Den här ölen måste vara kall. Den ska ligga i kylskåpet vid 4 grader i flera timmar innan man dricker den. Den hinner oftast bli ljummen innan man har druckit upp den. Då kommer spritsmaken. Sen tar det väldigt lång tid tills fyllan slår igång. Jag rekommenderar alla att dricka någon annan öl istället.
Kopparbergs Special Brew Super X-Strong 10.0%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Malt Liquor;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;"Wo gekauft: ------------------------------- Gekauft habe ich das Bier in Schweden in einem sogenannten Systembolaget. Ausschließlich dort kann man alkoholische Getränke >3,5%vol kaufen. Dose: -------------------------------- Die Dose ist blau-Gold gehalten und fällt mit einem großen roten Druck des Alkoholgehaltes (10%) auf. Die Fronttexte sind auf Englisch - es soll wohl die breite Masse damit angelockt werden (vor allem Touristen). Oben wird ein Golfspieler (?) dargestellt, warum auch immer. Sie wirkt etwas ""Comichaft"" und allgemein soll es wohl die Jugend animieren dieses Bier zu kaufen. Ich hoffe letzten Endes geht es nicht nur um den Alkoholgehalt. Nichtsdestotrotz gefällt mir das Design, die Farben zeigen direkt, dass es sich um ein schwedisches Bier handelt und wenn man ein Starkbier sucht, wird man ohne lange zu suchen, fündig. Aussehen: ------------------------------- Das Bier ist nicht, wie so oft bei Starkbieren, bräunlich/rötlich oder bernsteinfarbig, sondern gelb oder sogar hellgelb und die Krone ist nicht grob, aber auch nicht komplett feinporig und hält nicht all zu lang. Ich persönlich hätte mir ein etwas goldfarbiges Bier gewünscht. Geruch: ------------------------------- Das Bier riecht direkt penetrant süßlich, karamellartig, aber auch malzig. Wie so oft bei Starkbiersorten. Dennoch nicht unangenehm. Geschmack: ------------------------------- Das Bier schmeckt sehr süßlich und malzig wie der Geruch. Leider zieht sich vom Anfang bis zum Ende des Geschmacks ein herber Alkohol (schnapsartiger) bitterer Geschmack durch das Bier, der auch nicht so schnell wieder aus dem Gaumen verschwindet. Das können andere Starkbiersorten mit gleichem oder sogar höheren Alkoholgehalt besser. Fazit: ----------------------------- Letztendlich ist das Bier für jeden etwas, der sich schnell mit Bier betrinken möchte. Geschmacklich keine Explosion und mit wenig tiefe und einer Schmapsnote (sehr bitter), aber für Starkbier noch ein annehmbarer Geschmack. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Kopparbergs Special Brew Super X-Strong 10.0%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Malt Liquor;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;"Design der Dose: Klassisch, relativ schlicht gehalten - allerdings nichts besonderes. Preis: Circa 20 schwedische Kronen (2 €) - gekauft in Schweden. Geschmack: Die typische Starkbiernote überwiegt, allerdings ist dieses Starkbier untypisch süß. Geschmacklich nicht herausragend, eher schlecht. Das „Faxe Strong"" schmeckt mir persönlich besser, da es nicht die vorhandene Süße des hier beschriebenen Bieres aufweist. Preis/-Leistung: Für schwedische Verhältnisse aus der preislichen Sicht gut, allerdings eher, wenn man sich für schwedische Verhältnisse verhältnismäßig günstig alkoholisieren möchte. Aus deutscher Sicht weniger gut, da es deutlich schmackhaftere Alternativen, welche sich in einer ähnlichen Preiskategorie wie das getestete Bier,befinden (wie z.B. das Carlsberg Elephant Strong, Faxe Strong). Alles in Allem trinkbar, aber absolut kein Highlight. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"

Kopparbergs Special Brew Super X-Strong 10.0%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Malt Liquor;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;808s n FartRates review #16, courtesy of either anders37 or PennSPete Seriously though, can I get a cred check in on this 1? Pours a pale yellow with some decent head on it. The aroma is yeasty and a little bit lemony, it’s got some play dough and a surprisingly low level of booziness. Weirdly not awful. The flavor is decidedly hi-boost although it has a lemony character that does offer some pleasantry. The beer has a yeasty character and some sweet creamed corn. Certainly on par with the likes of Axe Head, one of the better double digit malts I’ve had 4 real.

Kopparbergs Special Brew Super X-Strong 10.0%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Malt Liquor;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Can shared in the presidential suite on RBSG malt liquor night, a.k.a. ladies’ night. I think Anders brought this to prove that Swedes can brew malt liquors with the best of them. And guess what? They can. This bad boy looks like a fizzy pale American malt liquor, and brings the corny, boozy, sugary notes to match. Also some straw and cereal, maybe some apple. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet mouthfeel. Not as highly carbonated as its US counterparts, but it’s a legit malt liquor.
Kopparbergs Special Brew Super X-Strong 10.0%;Kopparberg, Sweden;Malt Liquor;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Can @ Presidential Suite. Clear golden straw pour with a short lived white head.

Co-op Gold Low Alcohol Beer;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Random can of beer found in my parents fridge at the cabin, lucky me. Crystal clear dark gold with a sick looking film floating on top. Stinky crap corn aroma with a whole lot of ick combined with dark wet barn. First sip wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. Tons of empty corn bread flavors, strange I just randomly smelt chocolate powder. Watery empty taste slightly sweet no real hop presence. This beer makes me unhappy. Why would anyone subject them self to this beer that doesn’t even have the side effect of making you more attractive, witty, and a all around more enjoyable person.
Co-op Gold Low Alcohol Beer;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Not bad for a blonde, nice flavor and has quite a secondary bite. Definitely lets you know it a Canadian product (it has TASTE). Impressive. I’m adding it to my importing list.

Tucks India Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Tuck's Brewery;On tap at the Tuck’s brewery. This was a good well rounded IPA. Pours a medium orange with a nice white head. Aroma of citrus hops. Taste seems to go right to hops, malts are very subtle. This brew finishes with a bigger bitter hop finish, crisp and lightly dry. Nice grapefruit finish
Tucks India Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Tuck's Brewery;Not a bad beer, but not the breweries best offering. Hops are there mainly in the bitter taste. Beer is full bodied and barely sweet. Not bad.
Tucks India Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Tuck's Brewery;Clear amber with a big frothy white head. Syrupy taste of bad vegetables and malts. Not good at all.

This is even lighter than Monk in the Trunk, less flavor, mouthfeel not as smooth. Not bad, just was hoping on more for $2 on the 12 oz. sample. Would not call this craft. Ok for the summer season though.

Herkimer Doppelbock;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;On draught at the Herkimer brewpub in uptown Minneapolis, MN. Pours a semi-clear brownish amber colored brew with a thin off-white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma of caramel malt, brown sugar, a hint of yeast and some light chocolate. Taste is medium bodied, with flavors of roasted caramel malt, toffee, a hint of brown sugar and some alcohol character. Finish is semi-sweet with some caramel and alcohol aftertaste that quickly disappears. Definitely a winter beer for Minnesota’s frigid Decembers.

Herkimer Doppelbock;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;Snifter. 10 ounce, 12, 8? They didn’t tell me... Dark mahogany hue, slim ring of head, soon disappeared. Muted caramel malt aroma, nutty notes, with a trickle of maple. Good...-ish. Sweet and slick in the taste, toasted caramel is king, drying at the end. A bit grainy in the mouthfeel, but over-archingly candy-ish. Well-textured, medium-bodied, tasty, but very mellow for the style. A good doppel, but not very good. Almost smooth, lays languidly on the tongue, imparting flavor, but not sticking hard enough on the palate. Could use more depth, some greater heft in the body...definitely could be chewier, rather than sliding flavor softly on the tongue. But for a middle-of-the-road doppel, thumbs up.

Herkimer Doppelbock;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;Pours a nice dark brown, with plenty of copper and ruby colors when held up to the light, and topped by just under an inch of tan foam. The head leaves a thick ring aroung the edges of the glass, but otherwise reduces to a thin film. Not much lacing. The aroma is quite mild chocolate malt. Flavorful beer, starting out quite heady with sweet chocolate and caramel malt. About midsip, some drier flavors take over - notably a drier semi-sweet chocolate and a lightly toasted raisin bread character. I prefer doppels on the dry side, so the transition was most welcome to me. A hint of lightly spiced hop bitterness comes through in the finish, and blends with a bit of raisin for a pleasantly tart fruity aftertaste. Mellow carbonation, medium body, quite smooth and drinkable
Herkimer Doppelbock;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;I sampled this at Winterfest 07. This was by far the worst brew I had for the night. Normally I am a fan of doppelbocks, but this one was just plain awful. It tasted like stale cardboard, with an alcoholic burn to go with it. How they call this a doppel I don’t know. I tried the Pilsner and it was actually pretty decent. This, by contrast, was almost undrinkable.
Herkimer Doppelbock;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;Brown, syrupy, no head, tiny carbonation, skunk flavor, no hops or dynamics, alcohol after-burn. Not a good beer, slightly offensive. I will not try this again. Had on tap at brewpub.

Very pale, clear gold, with just a bit of head dying down to a thin cover...rather weak grainy aroma, reasonably fresh but dull...excellent malt usage in the body though, bit of honey, on the whole a little too sweet and drying only a little at the finish, but the biscuit malts are well judged and it’s in the end a solid if unremarkable affair.

Aroma is toasted malty and light grainy. Light butterish. Toasted malty and mild grainy to cornish. Bitter, herbal and dry. Grassy finish.

Herkimer A57S Kölsch;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;On tap @ Herkimer. Slightly hazy, light yellow appearance with a smallish white head. Light pale malty nose with a crisp scent. Crisp, pale malty, unexciting beer. Decent Kölsch.
Herkimer A57S Kölsch;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;A light beer all around. No yeast in the flavor or aroma. Very little flavor at all, some processed grain. It can see they are going for a summertime refresher, and it is great they do the lager styles, but this one doesn’t have much to it. Moderate carbonation. Add just a little more flavor and aroma to this.

Light and crisp with no head, vivible carbonation or foam. Aroma of light horse grain. Tastes like light wheat malt with water. Light fizz in the mouthfeel. Otherwise boring, but kinda good overall, you go figure.
Herkimer A57S Kölsch;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;On draught at the brewery in uptown Minneapolis, MN. Pours a clear golden pale brew with a thin white head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring and some spotty lacing. Aroma of golden grain malt, some cream ale character with additional scents of floral hops and bread dough. Taste is light to medium bodied, a tad watery but more malt than bitter character. Finish is semi-dry, a tad metallic with some light lemon zest and golden grain aftertaste.
Herkimer A57S Kölsch;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Pours light gold with a thin bright white head. Very clean aroma... just a hint of malt and grass. A bit nutty in the flavor profile. Hint of lemony hops on the finish. As with most of the Herk’s beers, it’s unspectacular, but entirely refreshing and true to style.
Davenports Top Brew De Luxe;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Strong Ale - English;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);50 cl bottle.

Davenports Top Brew De Luxe;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Strong Ale - English;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);"Bottle from Arden Wines. Orange amber with a fine, clingy skim of foam. Bananas and cream aroma building with cherry stone and acetone. Bittersweet and almond-sodden; alcohol not immediately obvious; madeira cake and candy departing with a surprising, flash-cooked hop astringency. Suggestions of Apple turnover, egg custard and Allsorts. Cake dunked in Special Brew. Pretty evil."

Davenports Top Brew De Luxe;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Strong Ale - English;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Bottled, 500ml from York Beer & Wine. Orange amber with white head. Initially quite thin on the palate, with a metallic type malty body, sharp, carbonated. Some biscuity malt and earthy hop notes do emerge from the pasteurisation and it finishes quite gently.

Mews Brew #69;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);On tap at Mews - Wakefield, RI. Blech, what a sloppy mess. Aroma is minimal to sickly. Pours a dingy golden with no head. Flavor is a mangled malt profile that mostly gives a strong artificial banana flavor from the wretched Magic Hat yeast. Dirty. Overly sweet too. Nothing particularly crisp or dry about this, just estery and under-attenuated.

Mews Brew #69;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);08.11.04 On tap at Mews. Looked the color of pale lagers around the world, pale golden with small head. Somewhat hazed, some lacing. Aromas are grainy, raw, and fresh. Flavors follow suit, but in a watered down cereal sort of way. Another brewpub product for the masses and I suppose I could drink ten of em if called for.
Mews Brew #69;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);On tap--not sure if this recipe has changed or not. Appearance is a pale straw that is rather hazy and a big white head. Couldn't get much in the way for aroma cause the bar was so smokey. I taste a distinct fruitness to this beer. I definitely tasted some pineapple with maybe some hints of apricot too. Nice hops in the rear with a decent bitter finish. Unfortunately, I cannot give this a more accurate rating due to my inability to get an aroma on this bad boy.
Mews Brew #69;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);I wasn't really sure how to classify this, but ale seems close enough. It looks like a light lager, straw gold color. Not much in the way of aroma. Flavor was pretty nice, started off malty and mild then a nice floral hoppiness kicked in at the finish. Not bad.

Cottage Santa's Steaming Ale;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Strong Ale - English;Cottage Brewing;Hand pulled pint into a UK sleeve at the excellent ‘Maypole’, Cambridge late Nov 2011. Dark brown with hints of ruby red when caught by the light: on top I had a wispy covering and collar of off-white foam. The head let the look down a little, but what was there at the start held on until the end of the pint. Malty aroma with some dried prunes, nuts and brown toast like smells. The taste was very malty, roasted, toasted malts again with prunes and nuts in the mix. OK without being startling or fantastic. The 5.5% ABV sat nicely within the mouthfeel, semi-rich but not creamy in body, lacked a punch or that sparkle to set it apart from other Christmas offering from the UK.
Cottage Santa's Steaming Ale;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Strong Ale - English;Cottage Brewing;Cask-conditioned at the Staple Hill Oak (JDW), Bristol 6/12/09.

Cropton Rudolph's Revenge (4.6%);Cropton, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Great Yorkshire Brewery (prev Cropton);Huge light tan head. Deep red body with small particles in it. Aroma is spicy wooden acidity. Taste is deep acidic salty metallic vomit-like. This is seriously infected. Yuck, yuck, YUCK! Not just undrinkable, but unsippable, even.

Schlägl Doppel Bock;Aigen-Schlägl, Austria;Bock - Doppelbock;Stiftsbrauerei Schlägl;I bought this bottle at Beer Lovers in Vienna and I drank it yesterday at home with the family. In my point of view, it is a good doppel bock, we could say that it is a dry doppel bock, comparing with the Bavarian sisters. The color is a light copper, thin and white foam regular carbonation, a bit sparkling. The taste is malty, caramel, some hop, plums and cloves but there is a side of dryness at the mouth and not smocked, a bit watery. If I compare with the Andecks doppel bock, this one is easy to drink even the high rate of alcool.
Schlägl Doppel Bock;Aigen-Schlägl, Austria;Bock - Doppelbock;Stiftsbrauerei Schlägl;On tap at Tribaun. Pour is dark caramel. Aroma is burnt caramel and flavour is more of the same. It’s super sweet, but there’s the roasted malts so strongly at the end. Also quite a bit of brandy and raisin. I like it. I feel like this would be incredible if I liked this style of beer. As it is, a little too sweet for me.
Schlägl Doppel Bock;Aigen-Schlägl, Austria;Bock - Doppelbock;Stiftsbrauerei Schlägl;Bottle, 330 ml, courtesy of and shared with JFK10000. Pours golden, no head. Malty, caramel, some fruity notes, but mostly sweet. Too sweet for me. Medium bodied.
Schlägl Doppel Bock;Aigen-Schlägl, Austria;Bock - Doppelbock;Stiftsbrauerei Schlägl;Dark golden color with a moderately sized off-white head with great lace. Pale malts with herbal noble hops aromas. Solid, but not striking aroma (6+). Quite sweet, with pale malt, simple syrup and a hint of light fruit. Middle runs into a little balancing hops which are more on the floral side so they don’t tame the sweetness much. From the color to the flavors this is more a hellesbock. A bit too sweet and actually approaching a strong euro to malt liquor at time. Tame a little more of the sweetness and I would really like this one. 5/10

Silver City Whoop Pass Double IPA;Bremerton, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Silver City Brewery;"01-Feb-07 (22-oz bottle: $4.29 at Bottleworks in Seattle, WA) I know this is supposed to be an Imperial IPA, and even though this particular bottle has seen a year or so in my cellar, just a single sip leaves me with the strong impression that this was never one a big, meaty interpretation of the style we get all the time here in California. Right now, this is drinking like a regular IPA. Indistinct piney hops show a slight citrusy element and the bitterness level is low to medium. I expected the hops to have lost a step, but this is pretty mild considering where a 1-year-old beer of this style should be. Malts are sweet and somewhat caramely, but there isn't a lick of earthiness, further proof to me that this was never a really malty brew either. The alcohol is so well hidden in this beer, I can't believe it's 9%, and the fact that I'm not catching the slightest buzz from a bomber of Double IPA, now I'm really suspicious! The medium body is lighter than most Imperial IPAs and the mouthfeel is quite dry despite the sweetness of the malt. Not a whole lot going on in the nose, just some vague hoppiness and a sweet, but mild maltiness for balance. The beer pours with a modest, off-white to light-tan head that disperses quickly, leaving a thin film scattered across the top of the amber-colored beer. Overall, there really isn't much that speaks ""Imperial IPA"" to me. It's enjoyable and nicely balanced, but very easy to drink and not especially interesting. If this were truly a great Imperial IPA with bold flavor, full body and distinct aromatics, there is no way in my mind all that would fade so significantly into what has kept my palate wet tonight."

Jamaica Stout;Kingston, Jamaica;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Razz Breweries Jamaica Ltd;Flavor grew on me a bit so raised it a couple points. Balance isn't the best for a foreign extra. A little too sweet, then a little too bitter, and doesn't blend together that well. Once past all of that I can enjoy the chocolate/caramel malts. Aroma is semi-skunky and soy-saucey. Appearance is dark black with mocha head...probably the best trait here. Rather go for a Lion, Dragon Stout, Guinness Foreign Extra, or some kind of domestic sweet stout in this style.

Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, light char, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Foreign stout style. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on even with the low carbonation. A very enjoyable offering."

Sangano Ambrée;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Traditional Ale - Other;Brasserie Du Bocq;Bottle. [thank you, Hildigöltur] Pours very murky amber with a big, very fizzy, beige head. Aroma is sweet, milky chocolate, malt, some oxidation. Highish carbonation, fair mouthfeel. Flavour is sweet, caramel, light oranges, some palm-oil, pineapple, red apple, mild oxidation. Some palmnut in the finish along with milky chocolate. Still not particularly good.

Sangano Ambrée;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Traditional Ale - Other;Brasserie Du Bocq;An amber beer with a huge off-white head. The aroma is extremely sweet combined with notes of lamp oil - weird. The flavor has its primary notes from cardboard and wood. Definately not my beer.

John Harvards Frostbite Lager;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap at brewhouse. Poured dark brown in appearance with a little head. Smell is cocoa with a coffee and caramel scent as well. The flavor is fruity and malty with a soft smoked presence. Crisp and dry.
John Harvards Frostbite Lager;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);had this in framingham massachusetts on tap. Not a very nutty and toasty dunkel, perhaps a bad batch.
John Harvards Frostbite Lager;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap in Framingham. Dark brown with reddish tints, medium off-white head. Mostly malt in the aroma, but sweet and roasted hints as well. Medium body, not the level of roast and smoke I like in the dunkel style, more sweet and bland if anything. Mostly dry finish. Not worst place.
John Harvards Frostbite Lager;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On draught at Framingham, 3/12/05. Dark brown/mahogany color, though more dull than that sounds. Foamy, beige head and an aroma of clean yeast, ginger root and light hops. Flavor is dull, ashen and astringently spicy. No malt sweetness, or very little of it. Watery consistency. The heavy, dry spicing covers up any crisp lager bite you would expect.
John Harvards Frostbite Lager;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Cask, Cambridge 2005: Dark orange color, small head. Plums, raisons and cinnamon in nose and taste - but very blend. Grainy aftertaste.

B&O Station Deralement;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;B & O Station Brewery;Draught: Aroma of orange (slight), a little caramel, and butterscotch. Not too much aroma. Beautiful copper color, no head. Flavor is a lot like a a bock or marzen style. Tastes of wheat, corn, and oranges. Slightly citrusy and earthy. Easy drink, I just do not like it. Overall, ok for whatever style it is, but there is no finish. Again, nice color.
B&O Station Deralement;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;B & O Station Brewery;From a sampler: This beer is a rich amber color with a medium-thin off-white head. Thin lacing. The aroma is very sweet fruit and malt throughout. Medium body, and the flavor was a little reminiscent of Raison D'Etre. There is a nicely complex blend of fruit, malt, raisins and molasses. The finish is sweet but not cloying. I rather enjoyed this one.
B&O Station Fruition;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Fruit;B & O Station Brewery;From a sampler: This beer is a light bubbly gold color with a thin white head. Very little lacing. The aroma is all raspberry, all the time. Light-bodied and somewhat crisp with just too much raspberry. It was more like drinking a raspberry spritzer than a beer. The finish is fruity and a little dry. Overall I was not overly impressed with this one.
B&O Station Hearth Ale 2003;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;B & O Station Brewery;"Smells of ginger, cinnamon, and pumpkin; spicy! Nice head, good lacing. Orange-copper color. Tastes spicy with ginger, cinnamon, pumpkin, and nuts. Easy drink. Overall Impression: Tastes good."
B&O Station Hearth Ale 2003;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;B & O Station Brewery;From a sampler: This beer pours a rich and somewhat hazy amber color with a medium light beige head. Aroma of pumpkin, along with some malt and allspice. Medium-bodied, with the pumpkin flavor at the forefront. There are a lot of other spices floating around as well, such as ginger, cinnamon and allspice. There is an underlying sweetness that becomes too much by the end of the glass. The finish is amply sweet and cloying. I like what they are trying to do with this year's version but it needs refinement.
B&O Station Mahoning Valley Pale;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;B & O Station Brewery;No aroma. Nice head, nice lacing. Golden/orange color. Flavor was good. Hoppy, spritey (the soda), and sweet. Easy drink, bitter dry finish. Overall Impression: Interesting flavor. Not quite bitter enough for an IPA. Good beer.
B&O Station Mahoning Valley Pale;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;B & O Station Brewery;"Deep amber w/ a lasting light tan head of small bubbles. Citrusy and lightly floral hop aromas dominate, also a little grassy; toasty malt as it warms and lightly bready, and fruitiness seems low. Overall very well balanced, but has a nice rounded bitterness in the dry finish. Hop flavor dominates as well but has a nice toasted malt and lightly caramel backbone. Aftertaste is definitely hop! The only downer is that no one hop is discernable in the flavor, but is does have a very light citrusy character. Very little fruitiness in the flavor. Fuller bodied with low carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel; alcohol is very well hidden. Overall a well made IPA; The hops are sort of muddled into a non describable flavor profile and I can't decide whether it adds or takes away from the complexity, but it's very enjoyable nonetheless."
B&O Station Mahoning Valley Pale;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;B & O Station Brewery;From a sampler: This beer is a murky amber color with a thin off-white head. Very thin and quick lacing. The aroma is heady hops with some citrus. Very rich body with a strong hops flavor dominating the entire time. While the amount of hops is in line with the style, it seems almost chewy at times. The finish is rich and hoppy and a little fruity. Overall this beer does not compare with the true greats of the style but it is a nice effort.
B&O Station Porter;Youngstown, Ohio, United States;Porter;B & O Station Brewery;From a sampler: This Porter is a dark brown (almost black) color that lets just a little light through, with a medium beige head. Thin and slow lacing. The aroma is equal parts chocolate and malt. Medium-bodied with easily the strongest chocolate flavor I have tasted in a Porter, and it was actually good that way. There are some malt, caramel and nut flavors for support but this Porter is all about the chocolate. The beer is very hearty and enjoyable through and through.
Chico Brewhouse Toasted Coconut Porter;Chico, California, United States;Porter;Chico Brewhouse;GABF 2003. I absolutly loved this beer. Like the description, aroma of toasted coconut. Flavors are also milk chocolate and just the right amount of malt and hops. Perfectly balanced. Just fantastic.
Chico Brewhouse Scottish Ale;Chico, California, United States;Scottish Ale;Chico Brewhouse;Another fantatic beer from this brewery. Nice amber color with a sweet and sticky hops taste. Nice warm mouthfeel and excellent floral finish. So Yummy.

Federation Christmas Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);I got a lot of spieces in the aroma and in the taste. Not bad but I would have expected a higher alchohol percentage for a Christmas Ale and a bit more body
Federation Christmas Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Bottled. Amber bronze, moderate white head and moderate condition. Strangely spicy nose, with hints of peardrops, pineapple and crushed weeds. Sounds a bad mix but seemed to work. More herbal weed notes with some spicy cloves lurking. Warming winter spice and herbal bitterness in the finish. If this was twice the strength and a little more fuller bodied it would be a far more interesting beer.
Federation Christmas Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Golden amber hue with a decent white head. Spicey nutmeg and cinnamon nose. Spices follow through to the taste. Malty body with a bitter finish. Decent ale that is a little shocking at first.
Federation Christmas Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Caramel coloured standard ale with a rum and suet very Christmas pudding aroma. The flavour is very sweet with again a suet and Christmas pudding prominent element. A quite terrible Christmas pudding flavoured beer.
Federation Christmas Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);Pastuerised Bottle. From Asda supermarket. BBE Jan 2005. A bog standard and dull bitter with a few spices chucked in. Not unpleasant but not exactly top quality stuff. Comes in a fancy tube with a Christmas card cartoon decoration to encourage purchase of this as a gift.
Federation Christmas Ale;Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dunston Brewery (Heineken UK);This is strong in cloves, herb and coriander aroma. Proper Crimbo. Flavours are very herbal, floral and even medicinal. The finish and mouthfeel are thin and really quite dreadful. An OK different beer for yule.
Blue Corn Barley Wine;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Blue Corn Cafe & Brewery (Albuquerque);On tap in Albuquerque. This barley wine reminds me alot of Sierra Nevada's Big Foot. Nice and hoppy, very full bodied and well balanced. Good job!
Blue Corn Barley Wine;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Blue Corn Cafe & Brewery (Albuquerque);Very cloudy rufous body with not much carbonation or head to speak of. Aroma of sweet fruity malt, blueberries, and wort. Tastes poorly attenuated. Alcohol is very prominent and unmasked. Tastes like 20% ABV. Flat, syrupy palate. Aging won't help here. This beer needed a lower starting gravity and extended fermenting.
McKenzie Tripel McK;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;McKenzie Brew House;Growler from Chadds Ford location. Poured a medium and hazy golden / amber color with a small sized white head. Aromas of fruitiness (apples and some pears), spome spices, and candi sugar. Tastes of candi sugar sweetness, fruity, and lighter spices. Sweet. Overall the alcohol content was well hidden.
McKenzie Tripel McK;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;McKenzie Brew House;Poured a hazy orange gold color with a small, white head that left nice lacing on the glass.

McKenzie Tripel McK;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;McKenzie Brew House;Draft at Chadds Ford. I’ll e-mail Eric about this. The pour was cloudy deep golden, with off-white head. Aroma was citric, candi sugary, with some spicy florals and earthy notes. Medium, lively palate, with notes of citrus, mild earthy hops, candi sugary malt, and some lingering sticky sweetness.
McKenzie Tripel McK;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;McKenzie Brew House;Small white head, fades quickly to a thin whispy cloud like covering. Lightly hazy, gold color. Medium body with some creaminess. in the palate. Lightly fruity nose of apples and pears, pleasent spiceyness. Honey and malt flavors, peppery notes and some breadyness also.

La parte liquida è di consistenza limpida e anche qui la grandezza delle bollicine è medio-fine. Il colore è giallo dorato brillante. Il corpo è medio. L'amaro è poco incisivo.

Ekò Puro Malto;Balvano (PZ), Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Drive Beer - Birra Morena (Tarricone);33cl bottle. Golden color, white head with short retention. Aroma has notes of raw cereal, ligth malts. Flavor is slightly sweet with corny hints. Very light body, slightly seetness.
Ekò Puro Malto;Balvano (PZ), Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Drive Beer - Birra Morena (Tarricone);Tried this one at Pub Italia, wanted to try a different italian beer. This one is better than the common ones, yet a bit faint.
Ekò Puro Malto;Balvano (PZ), Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Drive Beer - Birra Morena (Tarricone);330ml bottle (K Kamppi, Helsinki) Nasty corny limey lager aroma. Straw, brief head. Nasty nasty taste - corn, limey, nasty. Damn, I pulled a nasty face to match the beer. Didn’t look like a young girl after that, I can tell you. Palate is watery a bit fizzy. Finish corny. Poop. 1.5 might be an overrate.
Ekò Puro Malto;Balvano (PZ), Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Drive Beer - Birra Morena (Tarricone);"330 ml green bottle bought at Tasty Mart in Yuen Long. Clear dull golden colour; Three-quarter finger head and soapy white foam which fades in 30 seconds; Excellent sticky lacing with fizzy small carbonation; Aroma of full malt, with strong initial skunk (lasted for 3 minutes), floral, strong sugar, bread, lemon and fair grass; Close to medium sweet taste of malt, floral, molasses, bread, light yeast, light lemon and moderate bitter grassy hops; Mid to light body, Quite slick palate; Mouth feel is fair maltyness in a slick, somewhat sluggish body filled with emptiness. Strong floral with bits of residual skunk hops dominate. Sweetness is quite okay, not as strong as the smell suggests. Okay bread. Quite strong hops to close. Not too bad… Hoppiness is initial skunk with floral, lemon and light grass in nose, and a lot stronger in taste. Bitterness is moderate, quite notable with further sips and an abrupt, mid-to-low astringent finish; Slightly dry after taste. Hoppy and fairly bitter to mouth. Comments: Beyond the quick light skink, this is actually a borderline decent lager with passable maltyness, fair sweetness, and a somewhat thick but empty body. Good looks and lacing plus mid-fi hops don’t really turn it around. Drinkable but with some reservation."
Ekò Puro Malto;Balvano (PZ), Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Drive Beer - Birra Morena (Tarricone);Mar 2013 - an organic lager from Italy. Overall, it was drinkable and nice enough. Rich maltiness, bit sweet, full body for a lager - one of the densest I’ve tried I think.
Ekò Puro Malto;Balvano (PZ), Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Drive Beer - Birra Morena (Tarricone);Beer purchased in a biological point. Very clean, hints of malt and grain. Clean and fresh.

Morena Puro Malto;Balvano (PZ), Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Drive Beer - Birra Morena (Tarricone);Also in two listings. Quite good, enjoyable and nice to drink. A normal lager. Not too much of a malty one but still a little sweet. Earlier Rating: 6/10/2016 Total Score: 3.4 Not The same as the Classic one. This si stronger and quite refreshing. Still is a macro and nothing special to say after
Morena Puro Malto;Balvano (PZ), Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Drive Beer - Birra Morena (Tarricone);Bottle at Craft, Mercure Hotel, Patong, Phuket, Thailand. Poured a crystal clear straw colour with a frothy, long lasting white head. The aroma is sweet malt, light hop. The flavour is moderate to light bitter, with a sweet, light citrus fruit, hop bitter palate. Medium bodied with average carbonation. I’m sure there are people in the world who think this is gorgeous and will drink nothing else. I’m not one of them.
Morena Puro Malto;Balvano (PZ), Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Drive Beer - Birra Morena (Tarricone);Bottle from Fenwick, Newcastle. Pale golden with a thin white head. It has a sweet lemon, grassy and toffee flavour with a slight bitter finish. Pretty bland considering the mid-strength ABV.

Morena Puro Malto;Balvano (PZ), Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Drive Beer - Birra Morena (Tarricone);"330 ml green bottle bought at Tasty Mart in Yuen Long. Clear dull light golden colour; Less than one-quarter finger head and soapy white foam which fades in 20 seconds; Small sticky lacing with fizzy small carbonation; Light aroma of malt, with thin floral, molasses, light bread, light lemon and faint grass; Close to light sweet taste of light malt, with thin caramel, molasses notes, light earth, soggy bread, light yeast, light lemon and very low bitter grassy hops; Close to light body. Slightly slick palate; Mouth feel is more of a Pale than Premium – maltyness is low, barely better than most macros, well attenuated with very low sweetness, just notes. The supposed Saaz is only thin light earth, no spice or herbs. Nah!... Hoppiness is light floral, light lemon and faint grass in nose, and a slightly stronger of above plus light earth in taste. Bitterness is moderate to low for a lasting, fairly light astringent finish; Fairly dry after taste. Fairly crisp and low bitter to mouth. Comments: Same brewery, same green bottles, and (supposedly) same beer style. Yet the low-booze Eko actually taste richer and more fulfilling than this macro Pale pretender. Every aspect is so light to be anything but memorable. Drinkable as a Pale, though. Premium? No way!"
Morena Puro Malto;Balvano (PZ), Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Drive Beer - Birra Morena (Tarricone);330ml bottle, 5.2 % abv, at Casa Inferno. Plain white head, mostly diminishing. Clear golden body. Fragile lacing. Subdued smell of pale malt and herbal hops. Modest taste of noble hops and mild caramel malts. Mid-sweet pale malty ending. Clean in the mouth. Fair enough, rather anonymous though (Tromsø 26.01.2015).
Morena Puro Malto;Balvano (PZ), Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Drive Beer - Birra Morena (Tarricone);330ml bottle with label similar to the long neck, but ABV listed on bottle matches this one. Pours a pale golden color with a finger of white head that retains surprisingly well and leaves a few spots of lacing on the glass. Aromas are of grains and grass with hints of light fruit. Taste is quite well balanced for this style and is grainy malt sweetness with light fruit sweetness as well with a pleasant grassy hop bitterness. This is definitely a premium lager style. Definitely one of the better lagers that I have tasted.
Morena Puro Malto;Balvano (PZ), Italy;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Drive Beer - Birra Morena (Tarricone);At the 2nd Israeli Beer Exhibition, pours clear yellow with a medium head, aroma of caramel, honey, some sourish notes, flavor of vanilla, herb, butter, light bodied, blaaah..

Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #04 - Barleywine;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Harpoon Brewery;07-Aug-13 (22-oz bottle, Session 4, Batch Date 01-Jul-03: Obtained in trade with Eyedrinkale, thanks Mike!) All right, how about a little ten-year-old barley wine! This beer pours a hazy, amber body with half an inch of off-white head that settles to a wide, bubbly ring. The nose is very fruity and quite oxidized, with aromas of dried apricot, candied orange, toasted coconut, and pungent earth. Flavors of dried fruit, coconut, honey, caramel candy, brown sugar, maple syrup, and toffee all seem to accentuate the oxidation. It's sweet and fairly cloying on the palate, but the tanginess of the beer helps somewhat in that regard. The beer is full bodied and heavy, but not sticky, and carbonation is medium, which is pretty impressive for a beer this old. Overall, this was almost certainly better years ago before the oxidation took hold, but I did manage to drink most of this bottle anyway.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #04 - Barleywine;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Harpoon Brewery;I thought this was a pretty decent barleywine when I tried it in 2007 (only now getting around to the rating it). Raisin and some dark fruity sweetness. Hints of citrus. Pours dark orangish amber.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #04 - Barleywine;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Harpoon Brewery;Dark caramel color. Medium white head. I don’t like the smell. I don’t like the fact it is so sweet either like barley sugar. This is for girls who like to get drunk immediately. It’s thick, sweet, obnoxious and doesn’t resemble beer or wine. Another Harpoon foul.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #04 - Barleywine;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Harpoon Brewery;This is was bottled 7/04/03, so over a decade now. Pours a dark golden color, just slightly cloudy. Not much of a head, with no lacing at all. Aroma is fairly subdued, a little sweetness, but not strong at all. Not much of a taste upfront, some sweetness, mostly raisin and malt, in the middle, a little sour and alcohol in the finish, but very well balanced. Though 10.3 is a bit low for a barleywine these days, this is a very quaffable drink, almost too much so. I would have to assume that age helped mellow this beer, as time usually does. In any case, gonna be a fun evening!!
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #04 - Barleywine;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Harpoon Brewery;light tan, slightly hazy, no bubbles almost a great barley wine nose. more alcohol than raisins med body, syrupy and slightly fizzy alcohol and green raisings. that’s the difference. reminds me of raison detre. so it must be green raisins in the flavour and nose.

Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #04 - Barleywine;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Harpoon Brewery;Shared bottle courtesy of cgarvieuk. Last beer of the night, wasn’t paying too much attention. Reasonably sweet aroma. Toffee and slight orange, some farmyard funk. Taste is rich and malty, sweet with some sherbet. Slight bitterness, not the longest aftertaste. But pretty good.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #04 - Barleywine;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Harpoon Brewery;Bottle. Pours an orange amber body with a tan head. Pine and citrus with a berry like malt body and vinous etoh latent fruit. Sweet and piney, decent.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #04 - Barleywine;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Harpoon Brewery;"Light copper in color, clear with a thick whipped egg white head (there’s also a touch of beige here). Light, but sticky lace. Sweet complex aromas of apple, pear, some berry and a touch of lemon. The hop smells are up front and also intriguingly sweet. Mmmm. Rich fruit flavors jump out first: again, apple/pear predominate. There’s enough hop to prevent the beer from becoming coyingly sweet although less pronounced than the aroma. This would be an awesome beer with strong cheeses or rich desserts. The mouthfeel is full-bodied, slightly oily (in a positive way). The carbonation is low but appropriately so. The aftertaste is as complex as the aroma with fruit sugars, hop oils and alcohol warmth finishing the experience. More bitter than most barelywines I’ve had; but frankly, I like that...a lot! As reluctant as I was to purchase a single bottle at $4.49 (22 oz.), I think it’s worth the price--an excellent beer."
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #04 - Barleywine;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Harpoon Brewery;This one has been aging nicely. When fresh it was a little light and had some odd bitternes. After a year or two it is much smoother, not cloying at all and has some nice flavor. 3.1 Fresh
Big Horn Santas Beer Sled;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Porter;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);The Santa's Beer Sled is Big Horn's Holiday beer. It poured absolutely perfectly! Very stout-like - dark black with a HUGE, creamy, tan head that had great retention and stuck to the glass on the way down. It's aroma was of roasted malt, chocolate and toffee. The taste was of very sweet malts, chocolate and some slight toffee and cherry with a little acidic finish. It had a nice creamy mouthfeel. Overall, it was a pretty nice beer, but it was too sweet for me - almost overwhelming at first, but it mellowed as I drank it. More like a sweet stout than a porter.

Volendam West Vølen/Pijtje;Volendam, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bierbrouwerij Volendam;Flesje thuis gedeeld met J. Donkerbruin bier met matig schuim. Aroma is karamel achtig. Smaak is dropachtig, houtig en zoet. Nasmaak is ietsjes bitter, beetje zoet met de pit van een pepertje.

Volendam West Vølen/Pijtje;Volendam, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bierbrouwerij Volendam;Poured deep dark brown with a small off white head. Aroma of sweet citrus and roast malt. Medium to full body, flavour is vinous, bitter sweet almost barley wine territory.
Volendam West Vølen/Pijtje;Volendam, Netherlands;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bierbrouwerij Volendam;Bottle 330 ml at home, poured into a snifter. ABV 10.5% Dark brown red colour on the body, hazy and murky. In the place of head, just some big bubbles, off-white in colour. Low retention of course, lacing almost non existent. Very sweet aroma, fll of dark fruits. Plums, figs, prunes, pome granates too, black berries and forest fruits as well. As a matter of fact it smells like those concetrated juices that you need to dillute with water. Taste is also very sweet, very fruity, following the aroma. The alcohol is only a tiny bit notable on the tongue, more though as it warms up a bit and even then, it’s more notable by giving a warming feeling rather than flavour. Medium thin body, low carbonation. Slighty sticky palate. Overall a good beer, maybe a bit more sweet than I would like it to be, quite complex but it lacks some character, something to make you say that you will keep an eye for it in the future.

Northampton Decadent;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - English;Northampton Brewery (MA);On tap at the Brewpub Comes to the table a medium mahogany color with a creamy off white head that leaves lots of lace on the way down. Burnt caramel and buttery nose with hints of dark fruit, sulfur, and light earthy hops. The flavor is a classic English earthy mineral malty profile with bits of toffee and diacytyl. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Classic and probably close to style, but my sensitivity to diacytyl prevents me from enjoying this brew.

Northampton Decadent;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - English;Northampton Brewery (MA);Draught: This one pours a dark brown with tinges of ruby to the color. Mine had almost no head at all. There was a slight smokiness to the aroma. The more prevalent were rich malts, some hops, and perhaps some cherries. Also a whiff of alcohol. The flavor is very malty, without being overly sweet. Hints of fuits and only a touch of alcohol to the taste. It was a bit silky going down also. Very nice and warming.

Pleasantly nutty, hazelnut skin and figgy, rooty fruitiness make for a comforting nose. Gentle earthiness and tartish hop character, leafy and short in finish betrays the heavy lack of malt, especially for a brown ale. Rather crisp carbonation, ample, but light in body.
Northampton Old Brown Dog;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Northampton Brewery (MA);Pours copper with a medium white head. Smells nutty and slightly roasted. Tastes of toffee, caramel and peppery.
Northampton Old Brown Dog;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Northampton Brewery (MA);Clear copper body. Aroma is medium sweet, nutty, light caramel. Taste is medium sweet, toffee, light grapefruit. Medium body, lightly sticky. Not a great beer, but pretty decent for what it is.
Bear Creek Double Jack Imperial IPA;Redmond, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Clean, unsharp, low alcohol IPA. Nothing much to remember, but was good with my food. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bear Creek Double Jack Imperial IPA;Redmond, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Double Jack Imperial IPA--2004 22 oz. Bottle. 11.00% ABV. 70+ IBU’s? (3.75 / 5.0) 9.5% ABV? Light bottle conditioned sediment. Mild lacy head. Hazy bright light golden amber color. Rich floral fruit hop front. Big sweet creamy crisp caramel yeast fruit body. Rich mild hop spice hot end. Malt over hops. Sampled 9/21/2004.
Bear Creek Double Jack Imperial IPA;Redmond, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Cloudy amber with a rockey white head, nice lacing. Good but mild citrusy, piney hop aroma. Med bodied and smooth. Flavor starts with a sweet malt bready flavor with a mildly sweet hop bite to finish. This is a 10 month old brew bottled in Oct ’2004. The big hop flavors have faded but it was still an enjoyable drink. 8505
Bear Creek Double Jack Imperial IPA;Redmond, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bear Creek Brewing Company;The aroma had oranges and flowers w/ light fermented fruit, but the aroma as a whole was thin. The flavor was the same w/ slight citrus, light fruit, flowers and pine. The beer poured a cloudy brownish orange color w/ thin head and lacing. The mouthfeel was light and creamy.
Bear Creek Double Jack Imperial IPA;Redmond, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Pours with an orange-amber body topped by a medium thick head with some lacing. The aroma is slightly sweet yet bitter with a slight citrus note. Seems a little weak. The flavor is sweet and malty with a nice bitterness and notes of pineapple. Full bodied, dry and a little smooth.
Bear Creek Double Jack Imperial IPA;Redmond, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Poursa cloudy golden hue with a white head. Aroams of plastic, spice and honey. Mouthfeel is a thick with flavors of some hop varietal that I can’t think of because I have to start brewing, yet I know it’s a different hop than most double IPAs.
Bear Creek Double Jack Imperial IPA;Redmond, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bear Creek Brewing Company;(Bottle) Thin, white cream head with a good viscosity and orange body. Nose of fermented oranges, brown sugar. For an imperial IPA. Its very tart and piney but not terribly hoppy?
Bear Creek Double Jack Imperial IPA;Redmond, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Pours a hazy clouded orange copper with a thick, clumpy, pillowy white head. Very fresh grapefruity hoppiness with rich, lightly tart, caramel malt balance in the aroma. A crisp bitter hoppiness exists throughout the body with a light, nicely balanced malt sweetness on top. Finishes semi-dry and piney. A good double IPA. Thanks goldtwins!
Bear Creek Double Jack Imperial IPA;Redmond, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Interesting, and definately the fruitiest Imperial IPA I’ve had... Pours a cloudy burnt-orange with some head that left a nice lace down the side of the glass. Aroma is very fruity, almost like a smoothy, complete with bananas and strawberries. Flavor is just as fruity with only an aftertaste of bitterness that you’d expect with a IIPA, and that seems to come from spruce tips. Palate is kinda crispy, but it leaves the mouth coated. Overall it’s okay and nothing like the single version of their IPA.
Bear Creek Double Jack Imperial IPA;Redmond, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bear Creek Brewing Company;Poured a hazy orange with a large off white head. Aroma of peaches and caramel. I expected a little more aroma hops (and body) for a double IPA. Flavor profile had malt, pine and finished a little tangy. I felt this would be beteer as an IPA.
Gilded Otter Morning After Mild Ale;New Paltz, New York, United States;Mild Ale;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Vivacious C-hops mingling with ambitious berries...Secure caramel in demure roastiness...A beautiful, yet brash, Americanized mild ale...
Gilded Otter Dortmunder Gold;New Paltz, New York, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Depthless peachiness in ruthless citrus...A light flower breeze brings an effeminate cereal sneeze...If you want a generous quaffer, reach for their mild ale instead...
Gilded Otter Chief Matsaysay Porter;New Paltz, New York, United States;Porter;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. Growler share with somebody, sorry I forget who, but whoever you are, pm me and I’ll plug your name in here. This was poured into a mug. The appearance was a fairly dark brown close to black color with a steady finger’s worth of eggshell white foamy head that dissipated at a good pace. Lingering messy lace. The aroma had some roasty coffee bean up front, pretty bold and robust with some light milk chocolate maltiness wanting to balance. Light caramel. The flavor blends the roasty coffee bean to the chocolate maltiness. However, it ends up creating a fairly imbalanced aftertaste of the milk chocolate pummeling this part of the beer. What happened to the roast? Well, that blows monkey chunks. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Good carbonation and the ABV felt as appropriate as projected by the brewer. Overall, for the most part, it’s a pretty good porter even if the aftertaste wasn’t what I expected it to be. I’d still have again.
Gilded Otter Chief Matsaysay Porter;New Paltz, New York, United States;Porter;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Dark in color and right away noticeable light body. Aroma is light and roasty and taste is the same. Very light roast some coffee. Maybe I need the newer version if they amped up the recipe at all because what I had in the past was watery.
Gilded Otter Chief Matsaysay Porter;New Paltz, New York, United States;Porter;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;On tap at the otter. Pours a deep cola black with a thin mocha head. Aromas of smoky roasted malt and coffee. Flavor is more of the roast with a light malt sweetness. Thin to medium bodied, I’d like a little more viscosity here. Smooth bitter coffee finish. Going by the lack of ratings for the last two years, I’m curious if they’ve tweaked the recipe a bit in the last couple, because I found this to be rather good aside from the slightly watery body compared to some of the previous rates.
Gilded Otter Chief Matsaysay Porter;New Paltz, New York, United States;Porter;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Growler from the brewpub. Poured into pilsner glasses (it was an in-laws Chrsitmas party, I am lucky it wasn’t Dixie cups). This beer has a few things working for it. First its really beautiful, black as night body with a large dark tan head. Looks like a good Imp Stout. I’ll also skip ahead and say its had a good hefty body with a nice full slightly under-carbonated thick mouthfeel. My biggest problem is bean. Now I have said this before sometimes I get bean, dont know what that is but I get it here. Damn bean in the aroma and damn bean in the taste. But there are some nice redeming qualities. Roastiness and some choclate is present all around. A good chocolate milk aftertaste as well. All in all a good beer for the night but that damn bean.
Gilded Otter Chief Matsaysay Porter;New Paltz, New York, United States;Porter;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;I got a little buttered popcorn in the nose. Dark brown color and a low tan head. Toffee tastes with a hint of burbon. Berry-like middle followed by a dry coffee bitter. Quick profile and a thin body. I wasn’t impressed by this porter, and I’m usually very forgiving of porters as a style.
Gilded Otter Chief Matsaysay Porter;New Paltz, New York, United States;Porter;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Dark brown colored, little creamy layer of an offwhite head. Clay and malt noste and also taste, band aid finish / long lasting and roasted.
Gilded Otter Chief Matsaysay Porter;New Paltz, New York, United States;Porter;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Growler from a friend. Dark brown with a tan head. Coffee like aroma. Very roasty flavor. Malty and roasty. If you like coffee then you would like this beer. Enjoyable.
Gilded Otter Chief Matsaysay Porter;New Paltz, New York, United States;Porter;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Growler from a friend. Dark brown, tan head. Roasty coffee-like aroma. Flavor is extremely roasty to the point of tasting like the dregs of a coffee pot. Not bad if you like coffee, but maybe a bit too much. Not sure if this is the same recipe as the two other raters had but...
Gilded Otter Chief Matsaysay Porter;New Paltz, New York, United States;Porter;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;I don’t think was a true porter. I think it might be caught between a dark brown and light porter. Good roasted aroma. Dark brown appearance with a small light tan head. Flavor wasn’t too overpowering. Maybe a little artifical? OK.
Gilded Otter Chief Matsaysay Porter;New Paltz, New York, United States;Porter;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Heavy-handed oakiness under roast-branded fruitiness...Decipherable fieldberries floating around inseparable ash truffles...A bit more sweet malt could make this a plumper, healthier porter...
Australian Pizza Kitchen Strong Ale;Canberra City, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Australian Pizza Kitchen Brewery;First of all I reckon they're trying to con the tax man by claiming this is 5.5%. Tasted to me like at least 7%. I guess that's a good thing. Great dark amber colour, good head retention. Aroma slightly malty, some alcohol with a bit of leafy (English?) hop. I really enjoyed the malt character of this beer - really fresh, bready, malt sweetness without being cloying at all. Nice balanced finish (usually English strong ales finish a bit sweet for mine). Loses points for noticeable varnish, fusel-type flavours. Surprisingly good.
Wig & Pen Belgian Blonde Witbier;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;Hazy golden color. Coriander and oranges. Light body. Very refreshing, but has some strange garbage notes that is not appealing.
Wig & Pen Belgian Blonde Witbier;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;Old notes 11/2/09 Draught at Brewery, Canberra Hazy looking straw coloured beer. Holds a small white cap. Spice evident on the aroma, that earthy/woody, slightly sweetish coriander seed character, with a whiff of citrus. Faint hint of husky cereal in the background. Reasonable carbonation, somewhat light and fluffy on the palate, drying towards the finish. More spice on the body, seems slightly dominant, lingering on the finish. Get a bit of milled grain character and citrus as it warms. Low bitterness. Lacking the complexity and balance of a good example, still a passable beer.
Wig & Pen Belgian Blonde Witbier;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Very nice heffe. Aromas of bubblegum and banana. Taste is sweet, with a hint of sourness. Palate is oily, and thin-to-medium bodied. Pale, cloudy, with a frothy head.
Wig & Pen Belgian Blonde Witbier;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Didn’t think much of this, even though I don’t like Wit’s, so I really wasn’t a fan. the wheat, coriander combination turned me off having my half pint at the midway point. Spices in the aftertaste.
Wig & Pen Belgian Blonde Witbier;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;Tap. Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a lingering head. Aroma of sulphur. Pretty standard wit flavour, but fairly subdued. Light bodied, lively carbonation and a short finish. Was asked if I’d ever had a wit before when I complained about the sulphur.
Wig & Pen Belgian Blonde Witbier;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;...on the tap at the place. Didn’t look impressive at first, untill I had a whiff. Nice balanced nose of citrus, dusty wheat, with a small hint of yeast and ginger. The lacing was great, body a little thin, but hey it is a Wit, not a blonde. Flavors of corriander and slight spice to liven it up, finishes dry, clan, and citrus. Nice beer, good effort.
Wig & Pen Belgian Blonde Witbier;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;Tap. Average white head over a hazy pale yellow body. Floral-citrus aroma and nice citrus-coriander taste. Probably lacks the tartness of some of the better witbiers, but a refreshing and tasty beer nevertheless.
Wig & Pen Belgian Blonde Witbier;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;Draught at Wig & Pen, Canberra. Pours hazy yellow with a medium white head. Aroma of wheat, clove, coriander and ginger. Same flavour. Quite thin for a wit. OK bitterness in the finish.
Wig & Pen Belgian Blonde Witbier;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;Tried on tap at the Wig and Pen Canberra. Pale body with short head. Dull looking. Witbier flavours are there but don’t stand out too much.
Wig & Pen Belgian Blonde Witbier;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wig & Pen Brewery;On tap. Fairly disappointing. Quite muddy and indistinct. Initial aroma is full of empty promises, a lot more than is eventually delivered to the tastebuds.

New South IPA;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;IPA;New South Brewing;Didn't think this was as bad as many on here. Balanced and drinkable, no flaws, not north east coast IPA or whatever but floral perfume light citrus toast nose with some caramel. Amber pour off white head creamy nice lave. Flavors of toast moderate caramel medium citrus and floral notes - probably not designer hops and all that but well made and understandably not over the top probably due to the clientele. Drinks easily.

Huntington Beach Nutcracker Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Brown Ale;Huntington Beach Beer Company;I like brown ales for the most part. This one is kind of a weak one for the style. Clear light brown pour with not much head but decent lacing. Weak aroma of roasted malts dominating. Flavor is neutral sweet/bitter and the mouthfeel is not as creamy as I like but its ok.

Baird Red Rose Amber Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;California Common / Steam Beer;Baird Brewing Co.;Bottle from Antarabangsa, Penang. Poured a slightly hazy amber colour with a mostly lasting frothy white head. The aroma is toffee caramel malt, light red berry fruits, light woody hop.

Baird Red Rose Amber Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;California Common / Steam Beer;Baird Brewing Co.;Bottle from COSTCO variety 6-pack set. Pours darker brown, amber if you will with some beige foam on top. Malty caramel nose, really malt-forward, light toasted bitter edge. Taste is malty, pretty good hoppiness there too, balanced with bitterness. Full flavors, a bit fruity even. Not bad at all. Lingering bitterness, dry in the finish. Characterful.
Baird Red Rose Amber Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;California Common / Steam Beer;Baird Brewing Co.;8/8/18. Bottle from Jane Doe Östersund. I always like the feel of those steam beers. A light floral taste to this one. Deep amber colour. Its fine.

Par for the style.
Baird Red Rose Amber Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;California Common / Steam Beer;Baird Brewing Co.;Pours a cloudy amber with a thin white head. Good amounts of toasted malt and caramel are found in the nose, while being a little floral, bready, and with a whiff of grapefruit. Taste is mildly bitter. Flavors aren't very different from the aroma. Drinking reveals toasted malt, floral hops, and caramel on top, and minor amounts of tea, spice, and grapefruit found underneath. Lingering yet light floral aftertaste. Medium bodied, chewy in texture. Its pretty good.

Baird Red Rose Amber Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;California Common / Steam Beer;Baird Brewing Co.;"Bottle. Pours dark red-amber with a shallow, off-tan head. Nose is sharp with grapefruit, spruce, and lavender. Odd amber ale; it’s both quite sweet and very very hop-crisp-sharp, and manages to hold the dichotomy of being both at once. Weird; it’s like an optical illusion for your tongue."

Molson Calgary;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Purchased at The Club in Regina where we played our first show of our tour. Typical golden colour, with a white head that is kind of creamy, leaving a cap and lacing. Aromas are the weakest spot here, with junky hops over the mild malts. The taste is malty, almost pilsner-like with the hops showing better here. Quite a decent refreshing brew.
Molson Calgary;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can (old Notes)-Pours a clear golden with a small head. Aroma of corn sweetness, and slight hops. Taste of the same. Just another light bodied Canadian lager.
Molson Calgary;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle, purchased at the Co-Op. Light golden, mediocre head with poor retention. Aroma is chemical-tainted grains. Harsh grainy flavour, thin. This tastes like shit.
Molson Calgary;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);341mL bottle purchased eons ago in Edmonton, likely at Chateau Louis Liquor Store. From my notes. Pour was pale golden with foamy white head settling to no lacing. Aroma of light malts and corn. Taste is very slightly better than the average macro. Except for the label, there was nothing else memorable about this beer.
Molson Calgary;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);330ml bottle sample. I will never forget when my father brought home a ton of it from out west. From what I remember it was a lot better than a lot of the other products Molson offers.
Molson Calgary;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Last time I saw this on the shelves in Calgary was around 1995. Apparently my old tasting notes say: ""Better than Molson Canadian and after drinking 4 supercans I had no hangover"". Wow....was I ever young once or what? I remember this as being thin and watery but with a touch more hops than usual Molson ales/lagers."
Molson Calgary;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);If you try you can smell malt. It looks like weak apple juice. A bit of a bitter malt flavour that takes a few sips to find acceptable. No palate. It gets points for being available only in the SK (it’s NOT actually retired since I just bought this the other day) but why isn’t the beer called Calgary available in alberta? Since it’s brewed in Edmonton?
Molson Calgary;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours golden yellow, Almost no head.Sweet corny aroma. very fresh, But a bit too corny tasting. Pretty standard boaring canadian mass produced Lager. It is kind of odd that you Can’t buy the beer called Calgary in Calgary, or anywhere in alberta for that matter, However, I don’t really feel all that cheated that we can’t buy it here.
Molson Calgary;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);remember Calga-reeee, Calga-raaaa commercials. beer not as memorable. pale yellow canadian lager
Molson Calgary;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);So let me see if I’ve got this straight. Calgary Beer is made in Edmonton, and only sold in Saskatchewan? Golden-straw colour. Has that distinctive ’union made’ aroma of cooked apples and fusel alcohol. Quick, watery palate is merciful, showing more cooked apple, a hint of spice and very faint malt but less fusel. This would make a good retrobeer.

Manos Canadian Whitetail;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Manos Grill & Brewpub;12oz can via trade with presario - Thanks Trevor! - Pours pale golden with a huge sudsy white head. Not much aroma there at all. Maybe a bit of citrus but not much. Flavor is light grains, some sweet sugary metallic flavor too. Palate is light and highly carbonated. This wasn’t too great. Very similar to an American macro.
Manos Canadian Whitetail;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Manos Grill & Brewpub;Can. Light coloured ginger-ale look. A micro macro-clone. Starts out tasting like the bottom third of a warm macro. Harsh and metallic. Some sweetness but not really enjoyable.

Chumleys Holiday Ale;New York, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Chumleys;Draught at Chumley’s, West Village, New York. Murky amber colour with a a large fluffy head. Spicy flavour, loads of cinnamon and nutmeg. Not exactly presented to its best ability but apt given the season of festive spirit.
Chumleys Holiday Ale;New York, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Chumleys;Absolutely delicious. Looking like a brown ale, this moderately spiced delicacy greets your lips with a decent amount of sweet caremel malt to back it up. Truly noteworthy and perhaps the best thing Chumley's has served in a long while. Complex and enjoyable.
Virgil's Ale;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Utterly lame. But let's first give Virgil's BBQ some credit for choosing Magic Hat to make their proprietary brew rather than Chelsea Brewing. At least they have SOME brains. But where they fell short (or perhaps went right) was in brewing an extremely mild, flavorless ale that's more like an American Standard lager. You'd be hard-pressed to distinguish this from a Coors, and perhaps that's just the way the tourist customers in this Times Square BBQ joint like it. They can have it.
Meibo Yowano Tsuki (Midnight Moon) Sake;Seto, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Shibata Gomei Shuzo Co., Ltd.;500mL bottled 3/17/15, drunk 2/14/16. Very clear, glassy appearance. Very light mushroom is notable, with stronger overtones of melon, rice sugars and very light vanilla. I like that there’s the hint of koji/mushroom/umami, whatever you want to call it and the rest of the aroma profile seems quite a bit headier, though not perfumey or anything. Sweet up-front, though nowhere near offensively/cloyingly so. Milky, ricey and with some alcohol dryness mixing with the fresh melon flavors to finish with average sweetness overall and quite flavorful on the rice and koji side. I do get some green apple, from the commercial deScription, though that may just be at their suggestion. An odd but very enjoyable sake. Seems quite a bit better than the average sake you get in America, but I’ve got to imagine this is still well below average in comparison with good sakes you can get over in Japan. Medium bodied for a sake, with low alcohol perception and quite clean.
Meibo Yowano Tsuki (Midnight Moon) Sake;Seto, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Shibata Gomei Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Clear and still. Nose was dirty and a bit funky reminiscent of seaweed, earth, & dirt. Smooth mouth with a sweet kick up front, light sweet fruity flavors of sweet melons, especially some remarkably vivid honeydew flavors...wow, this is pretty freaking smooth and melony...I like the sweetness in this one, not cloying in any way, just very complimentable to the overall flavor profile...and smooth drinking fo sho.
Meibo Yowano Tsuki (Midnight Moon) Sake;Seto, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Shibata Gomei Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottle thanks to Book_M_Danno. Very pale yellow pour. Fruity crisp aroma with a touch of alcohol and rice must. Light fruit and must flavor, but it finishes fairly clean. Drinkable for sure. Medium wet body with an alcohol presence that dries the whole thing out in the end. Quite drinkable, but a bit sweeter than I like my sake.
Meibo Yowano Tsuki (Midnight Moon) Sake;Seto, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Shibata Gomei Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Crystal clear body with relatively low viscosity. Pleasant, fresh herbal and light nutty aroma with coconut and melon notes. Nutty cheese and creamy qualities to the flavor with a lightly sweet impression and a long finish. Smooth with some palatable thickness. Not bad, but not particularly interesting either.
Meibo Yowano Tsuki (Midnight Moon) Sake;Seto, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Shibata Gomei Shuzo Co., Ltd.;500mL bottle ($16.50) Clear, light tinge of particles and nice long legs on the glass. Aroma is very soft and subtle with some watery koji and light alcohol, floral fruits are present as well. The flavor has a brief burning from alcohol but is fairly well hidden. Creamy with a little umami to complement this light and subtle Ginjo.
Meibo Yowano Tsuki (Midnight Moon) Sake;Seto, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Shibata Gomei Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Subtle aroma of both lychees and perfume (oddly). Light alcohol burn (nothing too out of the norm for the Ginjo style) and a dry, light buttery mouthfeel. Quite enjoyable. I can see why this is popular.
Napa Saki Premium Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Saké - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;A clear pale yellow body. Rice, cucumber, alcohol and a subtle sweetness on the aroma. Flavor was well balanced sweet flavor added a uniqueness to it. It was almost like rice pudding. Smooth finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Napa Saki Premium Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Saké - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;I don’t understand the overall rating, this is probably the best sake I’ve had. Very smooth compared to other sakes and packs more of a flavor. Lightest unsweetened peach maybe.
Napa Saki Premium Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Saké - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;Appearance is almost clear, but with a slight tinge of straw. Aroma has a dark sweetness, like rice pudding or fermenting grain silage. Somewhat apple cider vinegar at first, but gets fruitier for a while, and then comes back toward the end of the bottle. Flavor is bold, with a sharp melon fruitiness up front, yielding to a smooth carmel and vanilla sweetness in the middle, and some alcohol warmth pushing through in the finish. There are hints of white grapes and even a little nuttiness(pistachio). Overall seems bold but well-balanced, with a good bit of complexity.
Napa Saki Premium Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Saké - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;I had to open it like a child safety cap, which took me awhile to figure out considering you can’t see what the actual cap looks like. Pours the color of peach or nectarine flesh. Has a lot more color than a lot of the sakes that I’ve seen. Has a nose of sweet rasins, brown sugar, and cheap caramels. A sort of malty flavor almost like a dubbel with strong alcohol. Very strong taste and didn’t seem very refined. This seems nothing like other ratings... Did I get a weird bottle?
Napa Saki Premium Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Saké - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;Its flavor is mostly a dry rice flavor. medium palate with a mild touch of oiliness. overall a decent drinking sake.
Napa Saki Premium Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Saké - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;The aroma is rice and alcohol with some grass like qualities. The appearance is nearly clear. The taste is somewhat watery with rice and alcohol. The palate is thin with some oily properties. This is a pretty typical sake.
Napa Saki Premium Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Saké - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;Very pale yellow. Heavy nose of sweet, mild, licorice like herbalness, light fruits (pears, apples), and subtle alcohol warmth. Same flavor adds some over-steamed rice and a dry, starchy, alcoholic finish. Medium body. Decent.
Napa Saki Premium Sake;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Saké - Ginjo;SakeOne Corporation;Pours clear with a slight greenish tint. Smells of fermented rice, milk, some hints of maple. Tastes of rice, vanilla, candy, toffee. The alcohol is not pronounced or in your face on this sake. Much better than most other sakes I’ve tried.

Karl Strauss Helles Bock;San Diego, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Clear golden appearance. Aroma is fairly clean with a subtle fruity citrus. Clean and malty on the palate with some orangey notes and just a touch of pepper.

Karl Strauss Balboas Barleywine;San Diego, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;Draft at La Jolla brewpub. Poured a deep amber with an off white head with spiderweb lacing. Nose is sweet caramel and toffee. Flavors follow with nice floral hopiness. Mouth is dry with a bitter finish. Enjoyable barleywine. I especiallt like the hoppy bitterness.

Grapes, plums, and a nice earthy malt. Strong caramel malt taste along with the same white grape flavor. Good hop backbone that blends well with an oak flavor. Its a good Karl Straus product, but only an average barleywine.
Karl Strauss Balboas Barleywine;San Diego, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery downtown San DIego. This was one of many on tap that I tasted and thought it was just ok.
Karl Strauss Balboas Barleywine;San Diego, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;"Marks for appearance are an average, as the beer was tasted in weak artificial light after dusk. Very grapey-hoppy nose, dark grapes, raisins in rum - and some more hops. Bitter-grapey; dry taste; dryness even affecting the MF that seems thinner than it probably is. Vinous. Very slick, nearly viscuous. Ah - Karl Strauss can make something good if they put their minds to it."
Karl Strauss Balboas Barleywine;San Diego, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;on tap-pours a thin off white head and amber color. Aroma is hops (cascade), syrupy-medium malt. Taste is hops (cascade), syrupy-medium malt, alcohol. Sipping. OK carbonation.
Karl Strauss Balboas Barleywine;San Diego, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Karl Strauss Brewing Company;tap @ hams pours opaque amber with no head. Sweet, light, dried fruit nose. Taste is sweet, thin and after drinking some of avery’s beast 07 vintage this is less than stellar.
New Albanian Silent Oath;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of light brown colored finely sized foamy mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a good lacing and a softly carbonated dark ruby red brown body. The aroma was mild with roasty dark brown malty notes. The mouth feel was tingly vinous and biting with a lingering finish of sweet raisin and dark malts in the flavor. I found this brew to be a bit on the harsh side and would have preferred it to be a bit more smooth. Perhaps some aging is in order here.
New Albanian Silent Oath;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;"Draft at Rich O’s in New Albany, IN. Small tan head, good lacing, no visible carbonation, opaque, and a reddish brown hue. Malty, fruity and woody aroma. Malty, woody, and somewhat of a roasty flavor. Mouthfeel was smooth. Medium bodied beer. Was told at this establishment that this is a ""Belgian"", but it’s listed as ""A Flemish Sour Ale"" on the site."
New Albanian Silent Oath;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;"They’re calling it a ""Belgian Brown Ale"" but I don’t really know what that means so I’ll call it ""Newcastle with Apples in it."" It was okay, and the apple undertones weren’t that strong. I liked it."
New Albanian Silent Oath;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;"Sample at the brewpub, provided straight out of the fermenter by Mike the brewer. Extremely dark and thick; grapy-sweet nose, which really develops as it warms into some nice complexness, with whiskey and pepper additions. Smoky, grapy and alcoholic (Mike claims around 10%, strong indeed for a Flemish Sour!), with a medium woodiness...mostly sweet. This sample was basically finished except for being a bit undercarbonated; certainly a unique experience, quite far from the average of the style but entrancing to those that love experimentation."
New Albanian Silent Oath;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;Pours a deep mahogany with a puffy cream-colored head. Aroma is complex and sweet with some toffee, light fruits, bready Belgian yeast, oak and a touch of tartness. Doesn’t even seem like a Flemish sour at first, almost more like a barrel-aged old ale. Caramel malt protrudes before giving way to sour cherries toward the finish, yet exhibiting a nice balance. A unique and certainly flavorful Flemish sour.
New Albanian Silent Oath;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;At Gravity Head/NABC: Deep reddish hue with a big frothy head and okay lace. The aroma hints of dusty and earthy yeast esters, cherry and current, lemon, caramel malts, and aromatic hops. The taste starts malty and fruity, balanced. A twangy and somewhat sour/tart midsection. The finish displays a vanilla, slightly woody, and nutty tone with nice lingering bitterness. Medium-bodied with a soft and lush mouthfeel. Nice, the barrel aging is sublime and does not overpower, done right!
New Albanian Silent Oath;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;Pours cola brown with a very full thick tan head. Fruity and nutty aroma. Lightly cherry with some nuttiness. Very good.
New Albanian Silent Oath;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;Draft: Michael, the brewer calls this a Belgian Brown in the style of Flanders. Like no other brown ale I've had - and that is a good thing to me! Very fruity. Another excellent offering from NABC!
New Albanian Silent Oath;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;Fresh raspberries dusted with chocolate. Slightly phenolic. Dark bittersweet amber-cocoa color. Full, tangy, rich cherries mixed with grapenut-like malts and some maple syrup. Perfect amount of tartness. Delicious!
New Albanian Silent Oath;New Albany, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;Draft: Light purple with rusty-orange highlights. Dense, creamy light caramel foam. Sugary nose with tart grapey notes. Rich, sweet fruity malt smidgens and some oxidation and wood. Meaty, herbal elements underneath. Soft, creamy, and slightly gritty on the palate. Gorgeous malt start with sugared dark fruits. Intensely malty and fruity throughout with perfectly-emphasized tartness and medicine. Mezmerizing blend of tartness and luscious malts. The finish is teeming with plummy, leathery malt and musty fruit notes. Mind boggling!
Bastion Forte;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pilsener - Imperial;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Sweeter brew, pours golden, with decent head. Not as sticky sweet as many forte brews, malty,grainy, not good, but I’ve had worse!
Bastion Forte;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pilsener - Imperial;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Stale feet, some hops. Light corny sweetness. Pale amber clear with no head. Med watery body with medium carb. Bland hops. Lightly sweet with some alcohol. Stale metallic finish. Light bitter unpleasant after.
Sato No Homare (Pride of the Village) Junmai Ginjo Sake;Tomobe, Nishiibaraki-gun, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Sudo Honke Co., Ltd.;This bottled Sake from a bottle shop poured a head of no head bubbles that were fully diminished and left behind a uncarbonated transparent clear colored body and no lacing. The nice aroma was polished rice. The mildly vinous mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a burning vinous aftertaste. The ok flavor contained notes of semi-sweet polished rice and mildly vinous. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.
Sato No Homare (Pride of the Village) Junmai Ginjo Sake;Tomobe, Nishiibaraki-gun, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Sudo Honke Co., Ltd.;Paired with wagyu dish @ alinea. Just a touch of yellow and cloudiness in the pour. Aroma is subtle pear, a bit of funk. Actually a lot of funk, and not really in the funk sort of way, more like dirty person...really just more like when people gauge their ears. So yeah, smells a bit like people cheese, some fruits. Touch of sweetness, pretty heavy bodied but I guess that’s to be expected. Not really great, but interesting.
Sato No Homare (Pride of the Village) Junmai Ginjo Sake;Tomobe, Nishiibaraki-gun, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Sudo Honke Co., Ltd.;bottle at ChoLon. waxy pear and paint thinner. bit dirty or muddy or rustic in the nose. some amount of paint in there as well. waxy and oily texture. stale notebook paper flavor. low ester flavor. medium acid.
Sato No Homare (Pride of the Village) Junmai Ginjo Sake;Tomobe, Nishiibaraki-gun, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Sudo Honke Co., Ltd.;Big anise aroma with a pepper spice. Pours clear. Pours clear. Sweet anise, alcohol, with hints of tartness.
Sato No Homare (Pride of the Village) Junmai Ginjo Sake;Tomobe, Nishiibaraki-gun, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Sudo Honke Co., Ltd.;Bottle. Pours very pale yellow color. Strong, multi-layered legs (one layer for each swirl!). Aroma is strongly sweet, and fruity with tons of plum and melon, pineapple and light spice. Pear, strawberries and cream, and light alcohol as too. Taste is dryer than the nose, with light notes of leather and really unripe melon. Some cotton candy. Nice and complex. Very dry finish, very light alcohol.
Sato No Homare (Pride of the Village) Junmai Ginjo Sake;Tomobe, Nishiibaraki-gun, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Sudo Honke Co., Ltd.;The appearance is clear, nothing out the normal. The nose is a standout though - unlike any other I’ve encountered in a sake...an explosion of fruit, like tutti fruity or ambrosia. A bouquet with great strength and character. The flavor is similarly powerful - again loaded with tones of fruit - predominantly apricots, pears - no citrus hints from this one. The mouth-feel is very full and balanced. The finish is long and pleasing. This sake is costly, but worth the expense if you want to treat yourself well.
Sato No Homare (Pride of the Village) Junmai Ginjo Sake;Tomobe, Nishiibaraki-gun, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Sudo Honke Co., Ltd.;Clear with only the faintest touch of amber. Aroma of fresh fruit is blanketed by the strong nose of alcohol. Thin and watery. The flavor was of sweet fruit trying to make itself known through the bite of distilled alcohol.
Sato No Homare (Pride of the Village) Junmai Ginjo Sake;Tomobe, Nishiibaraki-gun, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Sudo Honke Co., Ltd.;Bright, clear and vaguely yellowy in colour. Explosive fruit aroma (liquorice, apricot, salmonberry) is delightful. Bouncy, fruity character. Watery, though, and slightly tart in the finish. Odd melange of flavours that don't come together, especially the apples and bubblegum (phenols? WTF?). Sweetish. Drinking this is like watching a great empire crumble before your eyes.
Sato No Homare (Pride of the Village) Junmai Ginjo Sake;Tomobe, Nishiibaraki-gun, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Sudo Honke Co., Ltd.;Sato No Homare is brewed in small batches by the oldest active brewer in Japan. The TLC given to this sake really shows through. With a nihonshu-do of +3 (about average between the extremes of -3 and +12), the dryness is moderate. The color of this wonderful nectar is a light yellow/green, like a watered down glass of Chartreuse liqueur. It's unusual trait is its massive fruity aroma (very different from the Gekkeikan Cap Ace which is far more buttery). Sato No Homare's taste is its strong suit - quite delicate, not oily but more of a watery texture and the alcohol is barely noticeable. Fruit, fruit, fruit is what you'll taste! It's incredible how the Sudo family got these sorts of flavors out of mere rice without the addition of a few strawberries or Japanese melons. This is a pricey sake, but if you like semi-dry, fruity drinks, this may be your ticket.
Great Western Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Pours yellow. Smells like corn and rice. Tastes of corn and rice. Watery and not worth having again.
Great Western Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Hazy yellow. Bitter hops and sweet corn. Sweet malts and metal in the flavor with a hint of fruity bitter hops. Finishes without a bang.
Great Western Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Rate #2000: Hazy yellow color, fizzy head. Nose of stagnant hops and corn. Sweet metallic flavor. Finishes watery and bland with a hint of bad. Woo? Thanks Josh.
Great Western Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Golden with the slightest amount of hops in the aroma. Flavour is watery and quite thin. Thought it might have more but it was a let down.
Great Western Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Best of the bunch from swillfest (imo). Pours with a decent head and the now familiar pale yellow colour. The aroma showed some hops. The taste was o.k. some bittering hops mild sweetness good carbonation.
Great Western Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);not too bad, nice white head, yellow colour, easy drinking and somewhat flavourable. worth a try.
Great Western Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);I wouldn’t call this a bitter, but for a pale lager it’s much better than average. Chill-hazed deep yellow colour with a white lasting head. Soapy, malty aroma, a hint of grassy/floral character as well. Flavour is surprisingly good, caramel malt, brown sugar and some very faint raspberry/cherry character. Light spicy hop finish. A real surprise at $1.40/can.
Great Western Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Better than expected. Not really any hops on the nose, but a fair amount when tasted. Basically it’s a middle of the road lager with a bit of extra punch. Nothing special, but better than average for this style.
Great Western Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);not a bitter by style or flavour. clear yellow, no head. smelss and tastes like a mix of nothing and ass. bleh.
Great Western Bitter;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Western Brewing (Canadian Brewing);Smidge of malt aroma, pale yellow, almost no head. Sourish malt taste, thin. Ordinary.
Molson Bohemian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This is without a doubt one of the worst beers ever. It tastes like it was brewed then put into a pail and served to a camel where it pissed it out on the ground where it was gathered up, strained and then lime and gasoline were added to it then bottled for your enjoyment.
Molson Bohemian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);this beer is almost a religious experience to drink...there is people who drink beer and there is people who love beer and thats bohemian people
Molson Bohemian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);SASKATCHEWAN! Backup Beer of Rider fans.Bottle. 5%. Glad to see this is appropriately categorized as it is as much a Pilsner as Bud Light Lime. Very plain tasting pale yellow lager, aroma is very grainy, hint of corn. Refreshing, but that’s it.
Molson Bohemian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This is really bad. I mean, chemically and trashy. Bought a whole case because getting wasted was the plan of the day. Got wasted. A very functional grain alcohol.
Molson Bohemian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Originally rated June 2005. Bought a 12-pack of this at The Beer Store on Rideau street in Ottawa. Cheap stuff. Golden colour with average carbonation. Sweet malt nose. Corn afteratste. Tastes exactly like Molson OV (Old Vienna). Cheap, non-offensive lager.
Molson Bohemian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A Saskatchewan tradition... when you’re out of Old Style Pil you drink Boh. I remember the first time I had this as a youngster... tasted like piss in a bottle. But I drank it cause it was beer and it was 35C and we were shingling my grandmas roof in mid-July. What the what were we thinking? Middle of day, having a Boh on the roof in the sweltering heat. The graphic design artist should be given a prize for graphic design. Growing up in SK half the folks dont even know what Boh is. l tell you: it is cheap and good for bush parties. Literally. Go into the bush, stoke up a bonfire, and drink cheap beer or Pepsi.
Molson Bohemian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);341ml bottle pours a pale golden color with a 2 finger white head that settles quite quickly leaving no lacing on the glass. Aroma is light malts and grassy hops. Taste is malty sweet with a faint hop bitterness. Light to medium body and adequate carbonation. Average brew for the style.
Molson Bohemian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);341ml bottle from .... someone. I forget. Looks like watered-down apple juice - pale yellow, huge bright white fake-looking white lasting head. Ugly aroma - PVC and all sorts of sugary stuff - like cheap cake donuts with powdered sugar on ’em - and weeds. Taste - meh, icing sugar, straw, paper .... classic macro sweet swill. Light body, mild carbonation, metallic in the finish. About what you’d expect. The proles will drink anything.
Molson Bohemian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Back to the baseball swill. This one is not terrible. Pours a dark auburn/deep golden with a frothy white head. Aroma is small malt and trace of hop. Not a terrible macro lager.
Molson Bohemian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle [341ml] courtesy of tupalev. I am not expecting much but here we go: Pours a clear pale gold with a small diminishing fizzy white head. Aroma of grain and corn along with some honey sweetness and just a hint of grassy hops. Flavour is predominantly corn, a bit sweet and vegetal along with some fruit and a hint of grassy hops. No finish to speak of really. Average bodied. As far as Molson beers go it’s one of the better ones but it’s still not very good.
Ramapo Valley Skullcrusher;Hilburn, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Pretends to be a Scotish Ale - but doesn’t even come close to the style. Nice red amber color, small layer of a head, nearly no nose. Short kind of alcohol taste. That’s it.
Ramapo Valley Skullcrusher;Hilburn, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;Ramapo Valley Brewery;This was the worst beer I’ve ever had from a brew pub. I can’t believe they would be proud to serve this. If my eyes left my glass for half a second, I would’ve been convinced them someone spiked my beer with a cup of sugar. Way,way too sweet!
Ramapo Valley Skullcrusher;Hilburn, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;Ramapo Valley Brewery;One of my two favs at RVB. Poured dark brown. Aroma of malt, bourbon, chocoff, nuts, and toffee. Tastes malty, with some chocoff, bourbon, and a slightly smoky, roasty finish. The finish was pseudo Impy stouty and a tad Belgian dubbly. Firm palate. Great complexity and a bold, interesting flavor. This one will not only crush your skull, it will bang your sister as well.
Ramapo Valley Skullcrusher;Hilburn, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;Ramapo Valley Brewery;"This is no Scottish ale...I'm not sure this is totally a beer. The aroma IS very much like bubble-gum, and that's also in the flavor as well. There's some cocoa and brown sugar in the flavor too, and it just doesn't taste good. Gasoline maybe. I realize it's called ""skulllcrusher"", but that doesn't mean it has to be fierce."
Ramapo Valley Skullcrusher;Hilburn, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;Ramapo Valley Brewery;[growler] ORIGINAL - 2.8 - Very dark red, bordering on purple, with a small, dark brown head that disappears quickly - smells like plums and candy - initial flavor is like vinous bubble gum, which doesn't work very well - these make way for some plums and other dark fruits, which almost salvage the beer, but the bubble gum comes back in the finish, combining with some flavors I can't place that mix with it to give it an odd, medicine-like flavor - you know when you were a kid and the doctor gave you the liquid amoxicillin for your ear infections that was supposed to taste like bubble gum? it kind of tastes like that - disappointing. RE-RATE - so I've had the growler sitting in my fridge for almost a month - I went to dump it out and realized that it still had some carbonation, so I figured I would give it another shot, considering I paid the money for it and drank almost none of it - either my palate was way off when I tried it, or this beer got much better in one month's time - the odd, bubble gum flavor is pretty much completely gone, and the sweet, complex dark fruits really dominate the aroma and flavor - lots of brown sugar and some spice - odd for a scottish ale, but, as it turns out, quite a tasty brew - well-masked alcohol, too - a good argument for trying beers you don't like more than once - sometimes your tongue can lie to you.
McMenamins Transporter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On tap at the Broadway Mcmenamins. This is a nice dark roasty porter with dark chocolate up front and light coffee in the finish. The roastiness is a lot stronger in the aroma then the taste. Very smooth on the palate with a mild bitterness in the aftertaste.
McMenamins Transporter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Tap@Cornelius Roadhouse. Clear dark ruby red color with good head and lacing. Chocolate nose. Smooth chocolate flavor with a nice hop bite to balance the malt. Creamy texture and a smooth roasty finish.
McMenamins Transporter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Tap @ Cornelius McMensHazy dark brown, no head, light lacing. The aroma is lightly roasted but water and light. The flavor is chocolatey and astringant, dry finish. Not that great, too much roasted malts for a porter.
McMenamins Transporter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Deep brown with a red/tan head. Mild piney and earthy flavors, and some sweet cherries. Nose is weak wood and cream, really weak... close to without anything aromatic.
Olde Peninsula Double Cream Oatmeal Stout;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Stout;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;On tap. Nice black beer with thin tan head. The taste and smell is coffee, strong coffee, and chocolate. Nice and bitter. Very thick but quite smooth to the taste. Awesome beer. Wish they had this year round.
Olde Peninsula Winter Wheat;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;On Tap. Nice beer for a seasonal but could use a little work. It has a nice light wheat flavor but has an earthy/grassy flavor to it that is a little unwelcome. I don't know if this is really what they had planned. Very light beer. OK. Bells Winter White is a bit better.
Olde Peninsula Portage St. Porter;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Porter;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a dark brown color with a slight tan foamy head that didn’t leave much lace. The aroma had some smoke/ash with a heavy dose of dark chocolate and ended with a little bit of maple. Light toast. The flavor had some of the same as the aroma with some caramel malts making a decent play here. Light ashy/char aftertaste with a dry sort of finish. The feel was about medium bodied, perhaps just a touch under with a fair sessionability about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, pretty good porter worthy of coming back to.
Olde Peninsula Portage St. Porter;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Porter;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;Brown with a tan head. Smoke and charred malt nose with a bit of some chewy munich malts notes and a slight maple note. Heavily toasted and dry with abundant char, some black malts and some soy sauce notes (almost milky soy sauce). Well made, solid, classic robust porter
Olde Peninsula Portage St. Porter;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Porter;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;tap: dark brown, beige ehad, appears rather thin. Decent lacing. aroma and flavor dominated by roasted coffee and not much else. Thin mouthfeel. Sorry my lack of love for coffee brews is well documented.
Olde Peninsula Portage St. Porter;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Porter;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;Pitch black with a head that settles to a thin, tan film, leaving wet lace. I detected raspberry fruitiness over coffee bitters topped by a light exhale of smoke. Fruit again in the flavor (strawberry or raspberry) with defined roastiness and bitterness. We were torn on the style and I thought it a stout due to its body, which felt fuller than your traditional porter. At an improptu meeting of the LoSBD
Olde Peninsula Portage St. Porter;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Porter;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;Nice aroma of burnt barley, roasted coffee, and a malty sweetness emanate from this dark brew. Thought it was a stout. The body’s a bit thin, but the flavors are large, adding a smokiness that rounds the drink out nicely. Looks like another good reason to visit Kalamazoo. A growler tasting from El_Borracho’s and RAYBOY01’s Michigan brews cruise.
Olde Peninsula Portage St. Porter;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Porter;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;Smoky style porter with some interesting flavor permutations. I’d have rated it higher if it had a more substantial mouthfeel...it’s a little thin. But big flavors of smoke/burnt wood/espresso/and brown sugar are all balanced nicely by the robust bitter finish. I brought some home for the southside crew.
Olde Peninsula Portage St. Porter;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Porter;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub. Dark brown with thin tan head. Smoke dominates this one...so much so I think it could have passed for a smoked porter. There are espresso and chocolate notes in the background. Finishes with a slight sweetness.
Olde Peninsula Portage St. Porter;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Porter;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;On tap: Moderate chocolate and roasted coffee aroma. Dark brown with no transparency and a small off-white head. Sweet up front with a sugary chocolate presence. Finsihes with moderate roasted coffee. A tad thin.
Olde Peninsula Portage St. Porter;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Porter;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;2003 draught. Dark black pour with a small beige head, quite fleeting. Aroma of licorice, black malt and dark roast. Quite bitter and dark, with a good roasty, almost salty flavor. Flavor was great, but the body was only medium with a bit too much carbonation. I like chewier porters. Not dominated by hops, so that was nice.
Olde Peninsula Portage St. Porter;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Porter;Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Restaurant;This is a great porter and is a great addition to the Olde Peninsula beers. Very nice black beer. Quite smooth and slightly bitter. Sweet a little like a scottish ale but purely porter. Very nice flavor. Smokey and rich.
Fox River Sly Fox Belgian Ale;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fox River Brewing Company;Golden amber with a quickly dissipating off-white head. Aroma is fruity and yeasty with toasted malt, citrus and mild spices. Taste of toasted malt, Belgian yeast, mild floralness and some diacetyl creeps in as well. Mild with light bitterness. Ok.
Fox River Sly Fox Belgian Ale;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fox River Brewing Company;Apricot in color. Bubblegum, spice, fruity in the nose. Starts with a Belgian sweet malt and spice and finishes with a drawn out light hop bitterness. Fairly light.
Fox River Sly Fox Belgian Ale;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fox River Brewing Company;Amber Coloring. Small Head. Had Some Citrus, but Pretty Hoppy Overall. Wasn’t Convinced it Was a Belgian. Maybe a bad Tap.
Fox River Sly Fox Belgian Ale;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fox River Brewing Company;Pours amber, with fruit, florals, and citrus on the nose. Tastes fruity and hoppy, with a slightly tart, spicy finish.
Fox River Sly Fox Belgian Ale;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fox River Brewing Company;Draft, 12 oz, 03. Best of show in my small sample of this brewpub's wares. Dark clear orange, smallish head. Strong orangy-yeasty nose, buttery mouthfeel, initial sweetness and strong peppery almost mouthpuckering ending. Nicely done.
Bobcat Cafe Mt. Abe Old Ale;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Old Ale;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;Enjoyed a pint of this one on draught at the brewpub in Bristol, VT. This beer is an English old ale by style, and it is just a perfect beer to enjoy this time of year at the Bobcat Cafe. Pours to a beautiful, bright, deep amber color, with a thick, creamy, white head, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is excellent, with lots of good biscuity and nutty malt aromas, paired with some hints of treacle, and touches of peppery alcohol. The palate is slightly slick and oily on the tongue, with lots of good flavors of fresh bread, toffee, nuts, shortbread, and hints of light estery fruit. This beer finishes with more really great malty and light fruit flavors up front, then ends with a nice, warming, soothing, light burn that lingers. A fantastic winter warmer, and a great pint to enjoy at the cozy little bar at Bobcat. It should be noted that Bobcat is such a small brewpub, it does not do growlers. If you want to try Bobcat beers, you will have to make a journey to Bristol, VT. I can tell you from now visiting Bobcat, it is well, well, worth the trip.
Bobcat Cafe Mt. Abe Old Ale;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Old Ale;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;The Lure: A flaming ochre projects subtle maple syrup/caramel sweetness within an intriguing fruitiness of spicy sweet apples. A great meld of flavors is announced, as in all of their beers that evening. The Festivities: A soft, round mouthfeel introduces a pillowy hop bitterness and fruity, malty caramel. Subdued earthiness tickles a brown-rum like sweetness and woody hops elevate them all to near sagacity. Like McNeill’s Old Ringworm (on tap), this kind of old ale is more in the line of full mild ales or ESBs than the roasty, chocolatey, fruity Old Peculiers or the vinous, roasty, alcoholic and tart Prize Old Ales. Transcendence: Pondering in silent severity over the sovereignty of thought.
Bobcat Cafe Mt. Abe Old Ale;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Old Ale;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;"Draft, at the brewpub, July 03. Well shoot this is one of those cases where you're so surprised, so knocked out by the unexpected (in a good way) that you forget some of your critical faculties. This is a tiny little ""fine dining"" restaurant in a tiny little town masquerading as a top-notch brewery -- or is it the other way around? Burgers? Fish and chips? No, strip steak with gorgonzola; wild mushroom pasta; salads with julienned fried sweet potatos; and FUCKING AMAZING BEER. This Old Ale had an amazingly rich, sweet-apple-date-leather aroma and a wonderful blue cheese/port wine/maple flavor profile to boot. Don't forget the hops either, they're coming! Incredible. Probably the best ""new brewery"" surprise I've ever had. Check out the dry stout also; only disappointment was that those were the only 2 house beers they were serving, but I'm going back soon."
McNeill's Oktoberfest;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;McNeill's Brewery;Amber pour with aroma of bread, caramel, and toffee. Bread backbone with toasted malt, and toffee sweetness. Good beer!

Aroma of caramel and cereal malts and some floral hops. Flavor about the same, with the malts really strong. Average texture. A decent beer of this style.
McNeill's Oktoberfest;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;McNeill's Brewery;Bottle. Pours hazy red orange with a kahki soapy head and fades to a tight kahki collar.

McNeill's Oktoberfest;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;McNeill's Brewery;Draught. Good malt aroma. No head. The flavour is nicely malty with a little sour hint. Seems slightly infected, but not too bad. Slightly spicy hop note.

McNeill's Oktoberfest;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;McNeill's Brewery;My Bottom Line: Toasted cereals and spicy hops coalesce in this quenching, simple Oktoberfest. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam surfs the hazy dark amber. -The finish is quite forgettable, sadly. A tad underhopped? -The crunchy malt profile makes for a nice body. -The spiciness and prominent cereals made me hallucinate rye at times... Bottle.
McNeill's Oktoberfest;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;McNeill's Brewery;Dark orange-red, whitish head. Grainy toast aroma. Taste is grainy, some caramel, little else.
McNeill's Oktoberfest;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;McNeill's Brewery;Bomber. Poured cloudy medium amber with a short, well-retained beige head. The aroma picked up sweet, toasted caramel and bready notes accented by rustic earth and leafy hoppage.. really well presented. The flavor found mostly caramel along with some bready notes and a hint of molasses at the core.. light malt-inspired sourness and a hit of dry earthy bitterness around.. a little more sour through the finish, along with some residual sugars. Medium-bodied with low-moderate carbonation on the palate.. tartness was a little odd, but seemed somewhat intentional (as opposed to many infected bottles I’ve had from the same brewer).. OK feel and flow. Not bad.
Three Needs Peat-Smoked Altbier;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Very smoky with heavy sausage and mossey smells and tastes. Amber with a thin head. Interesting, but not my cup of tea.
Three Needs Peat-Smoked Altbier;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Smokier and oilier than their other (Altstedt) Alt, fair amount of character, some nice maple-bacony notes, but not truly distinctive.
Three Needs Krystalweizen;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Finally a wheat beer from these guys with some guts. Faintly cloudy light golden, pleasant but light banana/clove/orange/almond nose; smooth and sweet on the tongue, light hoppiness and firm malt, medium body, lightly yeasty and smoky. Finish a bit peppery, very clean, lemon remains on the tongue for a good while."
Town Hall Hoppy New Year Amber;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Sampled on new year's eve. Lightish vaguely hoppy aroma. Strong caramel malt flavor, touch of dark malt astringency. More hops in the flavor, but a bit out of balance toward the bittering side of the spectrum.
Town Hall Hoppy New Year Amber;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Released one day prior to New Year's Eve, this is Town Hall's hoppier take on an amber ale,(using several varieties, including seldom seen Sterling and Galena) and their first of that style I've yet encountered. Pours a clear, bold bronze color, with an enormous, creamy head of inviting foam atop. Hops reveal themselves in the aroma. piney, slightly citric, with further fruits, but it's a classic hop nose. Taste: Mmmm, just perfect, feels like an amber ale ought to, but this braver hop profile climbs on board the palate and pleases the tastebuds to no end. Long, tasty, fruity finish, almost sweet, with a medium body, excellent texture. Extraordinary drinkable, a very likeable beer altogether. It's days are numbered, so I'll linger lovingly over this growler and remember the New Year's brew that was!
Town Hall Hoppy New Year Amber;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Nice deep clear reddish copper color with a thin off-white head and some sticking lace in strings and spots. Aroma is fairly hopped up in the fruityness with a nice rounded sense of both citrus and tropical. A pleasant blend of dullish lemon with some apple & pineapple notes. A little touch of pineyness and grassy notes come through underneath as well. Taste is very well balanced with good malts upfront gathering a light toasty caramel then wham those hops take over with a really nice calming presense. Not overly bitter in any sense, tame and yummy, super subtle with an intreguing complexity. Dullish paled citrusy things with lemon and melon, some slight pineyness, floral and grassy notes too. Really nice taster with this one. Solid medium body with a nice soothing smoothness and easy bitterness. A swell drinkin' amber for sure, goes down with tremendous ease.
Town Hall Hoppy New Year Amber;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;small head that disappears quickly.... a ruby amber color. very pretty. this is DEFINITELY a hophead sort of beer. thin mouth feel... and hops hops and more hops. dry finish. overally thoroughly enjoyable and very drinkable.

Grumpy Troll Svens Nut Brown Ale;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Style note - I’m pretty sure they said this was a nut brown alt, although I’ve never head of one. Light amber body, minimal carbonation. Yeasty, caramelly aroma (reminds me of a kaiser roll). More of the same in the flavor, sweet yeasty breadiness with a light walnut accent. Good variation on the style!
Grumpy Troll Svens Nut Brown Ale;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;"Very light, very sweet nose, closer to pecan or walnut than hazelnut in both flavor and nose -- ehh who am I kidding there really ain't enough ""flavor"" or ""nose"" to speak of, I'm mostly grasping at straws.

Archers Over Dun It;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Bronze in colour. The aromas are sulphur and light. Flavours are sour fruit, sulphur and a pinch of salt.

Archers Over Dun It;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Conditioned at Far From the Madding Crowd, Oxford. Pale red brown beer with little head. Consumed at the end of our Oxford Pub Crawl, we are probably not giving this beer its best assessment, but it is a thin, watery, mid malt beer, more a mouthwash than drinking beer. Little finish, largely unnoticeable.

Handpulled pint into a pint sleeve glass, no head, looked flat and very dark Aroma of cloves and winter herbs mixed with malts and hops.

Not bad for the price but nothing that will make me want to try it again either.

Pours a deep reddish murky body with thin white lacing. Aroma is melted boozy butterscotch. Really aggressive. Mouthfeel is slick with notes of booze, J&B, and scotchy butterscotch. Definitely a ""scotch"" ale. Horrible."
Olde Burnside Father Christmas Highland Ale;East Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Olde Burnside Brewing Co.;I’ve had a pint of this last year and found it to be decent enough. However now that it’s sold in 2 packs of 12 oz bottles instead of the big swing tops I decided to give it a proper try. Poured into a pint glass. Best Before 02/12/2014. Pours a murky burnt red/brown color with a half finger of khaki foam. Plenty of floaties. Decent lacing. The aroma is simply impressive. Caramel malts and cordial cherries. This is a straight up dessert aroma. Wow, this just smells amazing. Taste falls a bit flat but it’s still damn tasty. Smooth caramel malts lead into bright cherry and some light spices. Finishes clean with some lingering sweetness that draws you back in for another sip. Not as daunting or peaty as most scotch ales, this really leans towards the sweeter side of things with just a faint nod of smoke. Mouth feel is a bit thin but highly drinkable. The ABV is no way nearly 12%, it feels like 6%. Overall, Olde Burnside really stepped up their game this year. This is the perfect beer to drink on Christmas. I only wish it were sold in four packs.

Olde Burnside Father Christmas Highland Ale;East Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Olde Burnside Brewing Co.;ooooo, ya this was a little bit of a miss from ten penny. i purposefully waited to rate this one after trying it last year, just to make sure i didnt have a bad bottle, and tried it again this year and its a little better, or maybe my palate is a little more experienced, but this isnt a good version of a scotch ale. not my favorite style to begine with, way too much malty sweetness, and this tries to cover it up with alcohol, not a good mix.

Great Dane Merry Isthmus Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Growler. Dark red color with a medium head. Interesting dusty malt aroma that is also slightly sweet. Hints of cherry. The taste is completely different than what I was expecting. It definitely had a smoked malt thing going on, but not in an overwhelming way. It was like a weaker Rauch or Scotch Ale, which is what I was sure it would have been when I looked it up. Tasty!

Great Dane Shorewood Schwartz;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap today at the Great Dane, downtown location: Poured a dark black colour with a big tan head. Aroma is super rich with heavily roasted malts, burned coffee and noticeable smokiness. Taste is firm malty and pleasent although there is something about even the darkest of beers brewed by the Great Dane that they always end up with this thin finish. Not sure what it is. Anyway, good beer overall.
Great Dane Shorewood Schwartz;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a dark brown color. Clear red light shone through when held up to the window. The head was khaki with good retention and lacing. Not much in the way of aroma other than subdued chocolate. Slightly sweet on the tongue with ample carbonation. Chocolate dominated the flavor, but thee were also cola, coffee, and nut accents. Like most scwartzbiers, this one doesn’t have much to be excited about.

Intricate lacing followed it down. Aroma picked up sweet, roasted milk chocolate and some fresh coffee. Fresh coffee, roasted grains, smooth caramel, and heaps of smooth milk chocolate in the flavor, as well as some bittering hoppage. Lighter-bodied, but smooth on the palate... almost like cola.

Great Dane New Peculiar;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Old Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Gravity cask - an interesting take on a rare style - a bit of buttery diacetyl quality in this, but the brewer is skilled enough to keep it subdued, just adding an authentic british character - nuts, raisins, figs - a bit of drying herbal bitterness - some light oxidized character, even some vinous notes - tastes british alright.

Scents of caramel, wheat, citrus (from the lemon wedge) and fruits presented themselves as I took in the aromas. The taste was a mixture of cherries, caramel, toffee, wheat, vanilla and molasses. It was well balanced with a subtle hoppiness coming out in later sips. Overall, this was solid and enjoyable. I would give it a try again if there was nothing new on tap.

J.T. Whitneys Scotch Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Deep, translucent and chocolate brass in color with a creamy tan head giving way to something in the shape of a turtle in the center. Lovely, web-laid lacing. Wet mulch, smoked peat, campfires and brazed hazelnuts light up the nose. Something else is saying smoke signals with burlap sacks flapping in the wind. Flavorful scotchy chocolate gives a stork chocolate reisin character. Dry, dirty bitterness harvests muddy spalt from the ground. Bamboo serves as a dip stick to lick the cocoa dust from wooden vats. Gummy wood-fired peat reinvents its presence near the end, especially when the modest balance is reflected upon. Simmered English toffee gets browned just long enough to bring out some smoked complexity.

J.T. Whitneys Old Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Old Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear dark orange/brown color. Head was light tan and left some lace behind. Aroma was of brown sugar, light alcohol, and apple. Smelled a bit like cheap malt liquor. Although I had expected none, there was mild bitterness. The flavor was earthy with dirt covered potato and other root stock. There was also a bit of nondescript spice and a hint of raisin. Not a whole lot of personality, most of the flavors were understated. So so at best.
J.T. Whitneys Old Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Old Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;I prefer this old ale to many I’ve tried by some big name micro brewers. I do not know how the old batches turned out but they just came out with a new batch that is great. Not a style I really like but I sure like this. It reminds me of sierra nevada big foot barley wine in some respects. This and the gran crue, barley wine and smoke porter are quite impressive.
J.T. Whitneys Old Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Old Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On tap at JT Whitney’s For my birthday I hit up the local brewpub to try a few things which I’ve yet to sample. It is a decent place with drinkable beer though nothing that will change your world. Still, if you happen to be in Madison it is worth a stop for lunch and a sampler tray. This was my first pour and probably the best of the three. Aroma / Appearance - After waiting a few minutes for the ice cold glass to thaw, I finally ventured a sniff. The nose was an interesting mixture of cherries, caramel, malt, honey and musty old bookshelves. The one finger cream colored head rested on top of a translucent brown body which started dark. As the light filtered to the bottom it became lighter, ending with a hazel tone at the base. Flavor / Palate - A strong bitter and malty impression hit the senses first. After that came some hoppiness which was layered on a caramel and resin foundation. The finish was a combination of malt battered cherries and fresh tea leaves with maple syrup in the background. Overall this was a pretty decent session beer though nothing that will set a benchmark for the style.
J.T. Whitneys Old Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Old Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Far and away my favorite of the samples I tried here, this poured very thick and viscous, with a thick off-white head and a dark cherry/alchol nose. Rich, malty, bitter-chocolate, syrupy, cherry undertones, some floral/herbal (tarragon and bitter herbs) hints towards the finish.

I’ve never heard any mention of this brewery’s existence, let alone a beer of such high caliber, so my expectations weren’t soaring. This imperial stout, which was entered into the Foreign/Export Style Stout category, pours opaque and black as coal through the center and translucent brown at the edges, but the beer foams a bit on the pour, producing nearly two inches of light-brown head that slowly recedes to a quarter-inch cap and leaves a beautiful, ringed structure of lacing on the glass. The nose offers sweet chocolate, sweetened coffee and milk, dark bread, yeast, molasses, prune, apple, and a grill full of smoked meat, very aromatic and highly enticing indeed, but it’s the flavor where things reach an extraordinary mark. Rich, decadent, intense flavors of chocolate bar, sweet coffee, chocolate milk, fresh herbs, prunes, fertile earth, dark toast, licorice, and ashtray bathe the palate in luxury. There is a fair amount of roasty bitterness to counter the high sweetness, so the beer remains extremely well-balanced from entry to finish. On the palate, the beer is full-bodied, rich, and chewy in weight, with exceptionally smooth, soft, velvety, medium carbonation, and a gentle dryness that guarantees the beer never becomes cloying. Wow, just wow! This is an absolutely amazing beer that I strongly regret not being able to share with others. Whether the three years of cellaring has been of benefit, I can’t say for sure, but it’s complex, vibrant, and incredibly well integrated, and it’s as delicious an imperial stout as I’ve ever tried. It speaks of luxury dessert, evoking visions of nobility sipping its decadence from a fancy, gold-adorned glass in the dead of winter.

Harushika (Spring Deer) Extra Dry Junmai Sake;Nara City, Nara Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Imanishi Co.,Ltd.;This is my first sake, so I’m not exactly sure what to expect. Pours almost colorless and slightly hazy. Somewhat fruity aroma, but this is light. Some alcohol noticeable. Flavor is very alcoholic, seems much more than 15%. Very dry with some flowery character. Finish is boozy. Alright, I guess, but I don’t have anything to compare it to.
Harushika (Spring Deer) Extra Dry Junmai Sake;Nara City, Nara Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Imanishi Co.,Ltd.;Light obscure beige color. I wish I had a snake eye cup. Instead I’m using a white guinomi. Usually I use my Le Face Cachee de la Pomme mini tulip. As does Oakes by the look of his ratings. Good sake tasting glass that is. Anyways. This has a nose of light floral nectar and spring melons but at the same time dusty dehydrated notes of the former. The flavor has a strong bit of ethanol and vodka notes along with some earthy plum and vanilla notes. The balance is there too as the nose matches the flavor fairly close. If memory serves me right, +15 is the highest nihonshu-do a sake can get when it ferments out, so this is about as dry as they get and surprisingly, I don’t mind it. It’s fairly pleasant. Finishes grassy and light bodied. I can see this going well after a big greasy meal.

South Street Absolution Ale;Charlottesville, Virginia, United States;Old Ale;South Street Brewery;On tap at brewpub Maybe South Street just saves their best experiences for the higher gravity beers but from here on out the flight became much more interesting. Skip right to this part of the menu when doing a flight if you are pressed for time. Aroma / Appearance - A reddish mahogany base rests below a layer of crisp white film. Caramel, red vines, and malt forward Hershey’s kisses invite one to savor the moment. The only oddity is the slight hint of a balloon just prior to being inflated at the local party store. Flavor / Palate - Red vines dipped in peanut butter refresh the palate. Nutella carries to a clean well rounded finish that slowly warms the palate. This might not be a remarkable old ale. However it offers enough depth to make it a solid winter warmer.

West Virginia Scottish Ale;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Scottish Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;Had this beer at the West Virginia Brewing Company on tap. It pours an amber/red color with a medium head and leaves a nice bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma was very sweet with a sweet malt being the main thing. Some hops were also present in the aroma. The flavor was much like the aroma - sweet malts - very smooth drink. Reminds me of Newcastle with a little more kick. Very good beer.
West Virginia White Out Wit;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;Had this on tap at the West Virginia Brewing Company. Pours a yellow color with hints of orange and has a large head that settles and leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. The strong malts are present in the aroma and there is also a strong aroma of orange. The flavor was surprisingly smooth. The orange flavors blended well with the malts and it has a slightly bread-like character to it. Great job with this beer.
Beba Re Magi;Villar Perosa, Italy;Pilsener - Imperial;Beba;Bottle shared with GregClow and DougShoemaker - thanks R. Medium yellow, small white head. Interesting yeast, spice aroma - a little sweet.

Beba Re Magi;Villar Perosa, Italy;Pilsener - Imperial;Beba;Bottle shared with tupalev, DougShoemaker & R. - thanks to R. Hazy light golden colour with a wisp of a head. Aroma is light, slightly spicey and sweet and yeasty, Flavour follows the aroma - light, but pleasant. Really hides that 9% very well - I’d guess it to be 5% or 6%. A little unexciting for a winter seasonal, but not bad.
Beba Re Magi;Villar Perosa, Italy;Pilsener - Imperial;Beba;"I’m rather disappointed... is this a low fermentation beer? Since both beer name and label are a clear reference to Christmas, I was expecting a belgian-style strong ale. Anyway... Clear golden colour, good soapy white head, shortly lasting. Perfume and malt in the aroma; warm, slighly spicy sweetness followed by a bitter finish; hints of alcohol find their way in both aroma and taste. No hops to speak of and, in general, not much to talk about, but still the beer has a decent character and taste and it’s surely better than most ESL."
Beba Re Magi;Villar Perosa, Italy;Pilsener - Imperial;Beba;"The Wise Men Cloudy blond color. Bad smell, scum (sweet, malt). Oily mouthfeel, too much alcoholic; sweeter in the beginning, a biting bitterness just later. Cloying. Washing water, no good malt, hop or other good flavors. An awful beer!"

Smells of quite toasted, grainy, bready malt and just a hint of herbal hops. Taste is quite dominated by the toasted, bready, caramel malt and ligher notes of toffee, dark fruit and licorice, with little hops coming through except for some light herbal/earthy accents, while there also is a slight estery spice presence to this, with just a hint of clove. Finishes bittersweet, with a light/medium bitterness and some toasted malt and estery spice lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

Cluysenaer;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Proefbrouwerij;Gekocht op 16-08-2018 bij Dranken Geers in Oostakker. En thuis geproefd op 26-10-2018. Cluysenaer is een helder goud-oranje biertje dat veel wit schuim produceert in een romig-moussige structuur. Het blijft sterk aan de glaswand kleven maar het slaat vervolgens toch neer tot een fijn gelijkmatig laagje. Toch veel CO2 verzadiging met fijne belletjes. Het aroma van Cluysenaer is wat alcoholisch stroperig-zoet, gistbitter, fruitig met appel, citrus en peer, moutig en wat grassig. De smaak is wat gist- en hoppig bitter, stropig zoet met citrus en fruitige hop en wat koriander. In de mond produceert Cluysenaer een volle body met een bitterdroogje, een ietwat stoffige textuur en een prikkelend koolzuurgevoel. Een harmonieus biertje. De nasmaak vloeit lang uit en is licht hop-bitterig met nog wat citrus en hoppige fruitigheid, en nog wat van de koriander. Met ook nog een licht drooggevoel. Dankzij de aromahops en de lichte nabitterheid is dit een aangenaam biertje. Verdere info en enkele foto's kan je vinden op: http://www.beersfrombelgium.eu/nl/showBeer.php?id=351

W zasadzie nawet zbytnio sie nie rozwodzilem nad tym piwem, bo dla mnie to nawet nie jest witbier. To taki pseudo pils bym powiedzial. Strasznie wodniste, jedyne co czuc to slod. Jedynym znakiem witbiera jest tutaj metnosc i osad na dnie butelki, ale to za malo. Straszna slabizna. W takie upaly jak dzisiaj no to jeszcze wejdzie bo lekkie, ale tak to z czym do ludzi.

Little Yeoman Porter;Cabool, Missouri, United States;Porter;Little Yeoman Brewing Company;Draft sample from St. Louis Microfest 2011. Pours a mostly clear brown with some gold highlights and a small khaki head. Aroma of toasted malts, toffee, brown sugar, wood, and nuts. Flavor follows suit closely but enhances what the nose brings. Light-bodied, with a toasty mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. I’d like to get down to this place sometime and check it out, as I’ve never really heard of Cabool before.
Little Yeoman Porter;Cabool, Missouri, United States;Porter;Little Yeoman Brewing Company;Ok, final one. Poured a dark but clear brunette colour i guess. Maybe mahogany is the best colour description. Toasty, caramel and some wood notes. But I got to dock it points for that clear redness and the suprisingly light mouthfeel. Hey folks, no hard feelings- i know it gets hot down there so you don’t want a big old porter sitting around warming up the bellies. All three were very enjoyable and i do mean this when i say i got to see this place for myself. Thanks again Brett and Hannah, what a treat! :&#41
Little Yeoman Porter;Cabool, Missouri, United States;Porter;Little Yeoman Brewing Company;3-2-08 bottle (unlabeled) shared at tasting Clear red brown in color with no real lasting head. Skunky butter malt creamsicle smell (it was as strange as that sounds). Sweet strange, almost sour smell. Thin. not very good. Just weird and watery and off. Very butterscotch like. Not something I look for in beer.
Little Yeoman Porter;Cabool, Missouri, United States;Porter;Little Yeoman Brewing Company;Pours clear maroonish brown color with a very small head. Somewhat thin looking. Smell is I believe, diacetyl. Buttery as in buttered popcorn and malty. Taste is thin, slightly tart malt, and again a buttery diacetyl flavor. Quite possibley an old bottle, but not certain. Very thin bodied, and unremarkable aside from the flavor as well.
Little Yeoman Porter;Cabool, Missouri, United States;Porter;Little Yeoman Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle at the brewery in Cabool, Mo. Translucent dark brown with light brown head that lasts a little while. Mild, roasty aroma. Just a touch of chocolate sweetness in the flavor before blossoming into the roasty malts, little espresso, mildly bitter. Somewhat lively, thin despite a stouty grittiness, dryish finish. The flavor is nice but not incredibly strong, and I think this is a good intro porter for someone used to lighter beers. Quaffable but not clean.
Little Yeoman Porter;Cabool, Missouri, United States;Porter;Little Yeoman Brewing Company;I’ve never seen a porter like this. Transparent dark reddish brown with a light head. Malt, raisins, bread yeast noticed in aroma. Also noticed some caramel, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Sweet with a clean finish. Like a light chocolate brownie. Low bitterness. Drank this a month after the best by date.
Little Yeoman Porter;Cabool, Missouri, United States;Porter;Little Yeoman Brewing Company;Pours a rich ebony. Nice lacing Flavor is full of rich berries and weak chocolate. Good beer.
Little Yeoman Porter;Cabool, Missouri, United States;Porter;Little Yeoman Brewing Company;Aroma is a slightly roasted chocolate that has an old, dusty twist to it. Rich brown color that still shows light, I can make out the logo on the other side of the glass. Not much of an off-white head and it fades quickly like a soda. Bitter, roasty coffee and chocolate character with a ciggerette smoke finish. The body is pretty thin with high carbonation. Thanks to Doppelganger for this one.
Little Yeoman Porter;Cabool, Missouri, United States;Porter;Little Yeoman Brewing Company;Bottled, thanks beerhandy! Cloudy mahogany colour. Syrupy aroma. Sweet with clean mouthfeel and notes of spun sugar and toffee. Rather one dimensional. Similar to some French bière noire.
Little Yeoman Porter;Cabool, Missouri, United States;Porter;Little Yeoman Brewing Company;Pours modestly dark red amber. A decent cap of off-white head. Aromas of toast, brown sugar, and a bit of smoke. Hmm. Not sure what to make of this. There is nothing wrong with it, on the contrary, I actually find it very tasty sipping. Maybe they were shooting for the mostly brown malt porters of the 1700s? At any rate, there is a very mild dry roastiness to the flavor, some caramel, but the yeast profile strikes me as very Belgian. Banana and clove esters in the finish. Palate is a bit on the thin side, but a nice toasty dryness. I feel bad rating this very good tasting beer so poorly, but it just isn’t brewed to anything like modern style. An attempt to recreate a vintage porter would be great, and maybe that is what they had in mind. But if that’s what they are shooting for it needs to say so on the label! If I had to group this with something else I had tasted, I would call this a close cousin of New Belgium’s 1554. (Nicer than that particular brew, but in the same vein.)
Little Yeoman IPA;Cabool, Missouri, United States;IPA;Little Yeoman Brewing Company;This beer is a monster! However, it is fragrant, pleasing to the eye in an attractive golden brown color, and its taste is delicious. It goes down smooth and leaves a clean aftertaste. All in all a great beer to drink if you love beer and are tired of drinking the usual run of the mill stuff that you can buy at a liquor store.

Darker orange body with lots of carbonation when you hold it up to the light. Very fresh hoppy aroma, which carries over into the flavor. Flavor doesn’t seem complex so I’m guessing it’s a single hop beer. Hops linger for quite some time on the palate.

Barleys Casino Doppel Bock;Henderson, Nevada, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Barley's Casino and Brewing;Extremely dissappointing. Although, I guess it's my fault for getting my hopes up after all the others. Color was a deep brown with a weak sweet nose and a sharp palate.

Taste follows aroma plus a tiny hint of chocolate. Too sweet and strangely sour. Medium to strong carbonation. Pretty thin and watery. Not that balanced. Just a mediocre Dunkel.

Ahornberger Landbier Dunkel;Konradsreuth, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Ahornberger Landbrauerei Strößner-Bräu;Purchased in Carrefour, Pudong in a 50cl bottle as 'Frankenwälder Bärentruuk' with an ABV of 5.1%. Swingtop-type closure. Presumably, the original name and label was not German enough, so they changed it. Similar colour to Coke, but very slightly more pink. White head which disappeared instantly, leaving the beer looking extremely flat. Slight aroma of raisins and brown bread. The taste is of mild roasted flavours and is very sweet with little balancing bitterness. Rather thin and watery with little complexity and poor balance. Not a good Dunkeler.

Blue Corn M1 IPA;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Blue Corn Cafe & Brewery (Albuquerque);Deep copper body and soft white head. Nice big hoppy aroma of citrus, pine, and cheese. Flavor of grapefruit, pine, juniper, and orange. The malts are here too to lend some nice balance. Decent stuff.
Bonfire Abbey Tripel;Northville, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Bonfire Bistro and Brewery;draft at brewery. the server ’informed’ me that this was a german ale, and called it a ’tripel bock’ so i didn’t exactly know what to expect. but, what i got was a reasonably decent tripel--tons of banana and yeasty fruits, some cloves. light amber color with a white head. a bit of an alcohol presence which slows the drinking down a bit, but it’s a pretty good sippin’ tripel.
Bonfire Abbey Tripel;Northville, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Bonfire Bistro and Brewery;Limited seasonal specialty. A medium amber color with small light head. Slight fruity aroma and flavor with nice alcohol bite. Finishes with hints of banana and sour cherries. My favorite of the beers I've had from Bonfire.

Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boston Beer Company;Brown color. Big , beige head. Toasted caramel, chocolate and dried fruits in the aroma . Sweet (not cloying) with light, roasted bitterness. Full bodied but very easy to drink.
Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boston Beer Company;Chocolate flavor with some dark fruits. Low carbonation. Low alcohol. Very smooth. Goes down very easy. Very well put together beer!
Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boston Beer Company;Drank from bottle. Mode and taste smell a bit like chocolate covered cherries. In the mouth similar, less cherry. Kind of like a liquid middle of a trickle. A bit sweet but by no means do. Decent chocolate notes to it. Interesting and drinkable, although not sure if want more than one, a bit syrupy
Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boston Beer Company;I can't really smell anything because I have a cold. Thick tan head on top of a dark dark body. It tastes like a stout but without the cutting this of an ale. If I love Stouts I would love this I would love this beer.
Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boston Beer Company;Sweet and roasty aroma, molasses and faint chocolate. Dark and opaque, with a deep ruby color revealed by a strong back-light. Head is relatively short, even with a vigorous pour, tan, receding quickly to a ring and thin cap. Stringy lacing slides quickly downs into the beer. Body is relatively thick. Taste sweet chocolate, more enjoyable that the other reviews led me to expect (I have to stop reading them first). Not as roasty in the taste as in the aroma with hints of brandy and raisins. The chocolate remains throughout, but the sweetness is moderated by a mild bitterness in the middle which carries through to the aftertaste. Nonetheless, this remains a fairly sweet beer, but never crosses over into overly sweet. I enjoyed it a lot. It is a welcome member of the Winter Classics box.
Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boston Beer Company;Even under light the pour is jet black with 1.5 inch thick caramel head which quickly dissipates. Faint cocoa aroma. Pleasant chocolatey sweetness. Not as deep and robust as the Holiday Porter, but tasty nonetheless. Medium mouthfeel with notes of anise, hazelnut and faint toffee. Overall it's on the watered-down side, but reasonably serviceable for what it is.
Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Boston Beer Company;Found out of bottle from a variety pack. The appearance is an appealing dark with slight tan head. Aroma was light chocolate but the taste was delicious. Sweet chocolate that was well mixed and present throughout. Great winter option and would definitely drink again.

Goose Island Russian Imperial Stout;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On-tap at the pub... Pours with a midnight black body, an equally impressive head. A big medium tan head, no bubbles just thick foam, great retention and fully and totally coating lacing... The aroma is too dead for a full stout, some roasted grain, molasses, and some dry hop notes, lighter version of Nighter Stalker. As it warms get a lot more roasty... The taste is a little better, the hops are mostly gone and some roasted chocolate and nut notes come through, more brown ale tasting than a stout though. On the sweeter side for a ris, too sweet for me. Average ris, I’d pass on this in the future.

McMenamins Pullman Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On tap at the High St. Mcmenamins. This brew pours very flat, a faint light tan head sat atop the dark red/brown body. Aroma has some nice mocha notes with a hint of a big ol bitterness to it. This brew had a nice roastiness but a bit too much bitterness in the finish. Good dark bakers chocolate flavors come through well and some coffee hides in the finish.
McMenamins Pullman Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Popped into my local Macs , Thompson Brewpub in Salem for this. Very nice looking darkish mahogany coloured ale..with a small tan head. Nice aroma mostly of malts though some hops show up. Nice smooth malty taste to start..but there is some rather nice hidden hops that appear as a pleasant and lasting bitterness at the end of the mouthful..Nice chocolaty flavours also. Pretty smooth and easy on the palate. An extremelly drinkable porter from Mcmenamins..I drank 3 pints in an hour.
Three Needs English Pale Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - English;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Draught pint. Clear light orange, minimal head. Lightly malty, biscuity nose. Nice flavor: begins full and orangey-creamy-cold (sorta like a creamsicle), turns slightly sour, grapefruity. Slight finishing thinness made up for by awesome, long-lasting bright hoppiness. Pretty decent, above average for 3N.

Big Bear Mountain Grizzly Bear Doppel Bock;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;Served on tap at Big Bear Mountain Brewery. The appearance is a medium dark brown with some large bubbles. The aromas are mild malts, brown sugar, and medium roast malts. The flavors are a bit of fruity esters, some brown sugar, grains, almost some tea in there. The mouth is medium bodied, especially for the supposed 10+%. Carbonation is low but there unlike some of the others. Overall an average but decent doppelbock.
Big Bear Mountain Grizzly Bear Doppel Bock;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;A: The pour is a deep dark brown that borders on black with a thin off-white head. S: Nose is quite sweet with some burnt sugar, coffee, licorice, and dark chocolate coming through. Nothing really doppelbock about it, more like a porter, but actually pretty good. T: A nice caramel sweetness along with some toffee and burnt sugar. Some hints of chocolate and licorice as well as a nice roasted malt flavor. M: The body is medium to full with a real sticky chewy texture and a moderate carbonation. D: Wow, a good beer from these guys. Again, this isn’t much like any other doppelbock, but it’s really quite enjoyable. I’d stick with this beer if you find yourself at this brewery.

Big Bear Mountain Grizzly Bear Doppel Bock;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;Aroma is strongly chocolatey and roasty malt. Pours almost black, very dark brown. Very roasty chocolate flavors. To me the body is very heavy, almost to a syruppy extent. The alcohol is masked for the most part, but there is some warmth that peaks through, especially when you are drinking this stuff on a cold winter Big Bear night. The nice lady that runs this place with her husband suggested mixing the Doppel Bock with the Orange Blossom to make a kind of orange chocolate truffle flavored beer. We tried this and it was very good.
Big Bear Mountain Grizzly Bear Doppel Bock;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Poured a brown color with some red hues. Nice head and lacing. Aroma is very fresh and bready. Flavor is again very fresh. Reminds me of walking through an active brewery. Lots of excellent roasted flavors with some light bitterness. One note: The brewer said this is 11% ABV but I bought a growler and had at least 4 pints and had only a minor buzz. My wife had a couple pints (and she is a complete light-weight) and she also noticed the lack of alcohol. There is no way the batch I had was 11%...probably more like 5%. I kept the beer at 11% on ratebeer as this may have been an anomaly (or I had an unusual tolerance that night!)
Big Bear Mountain Old Miners Gold Pilsener;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;tap at brewpub-pours light golden with a small head. grainy nose and flavors are really off-almost like overcooked malt which gave this beer a really oxidized finish. not much here and not much to talk about.

Big Bear Mountain Old Miners Gold Pilsener;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;A: The pour is a hazy pale straw color with a finger or so worth of white foam. S: A sour lager? A lemony flavor along with some light cracker malts and that’s about it. At least it’s not skunky... T: A light hop bitterness with some hints of grassy hops. A very light beer overall with some light cracker flavored malt and again the lemony tartness. M: Certainly light in body but a nice lively carbonation that gives the beer a nice crispness rather than the limp feeling of all the other beers. D: I know this beer isn’t supposed to be sour, but it was probably the best thing about this beer. Is that a bad thing?
Big Bear Mountain Old Miners Gold Pilsener;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;Draft. Amber beer with a whitish head.

Some biscuity malty, hinting at English pale, bubblegum sweetness, very lightly hopped in the finish. This is a big alcohol beer but you’d never know from the malt flavor or the body. You’d think they would have held back the ABV rather than elevating it making it more malt liquor than english pale or ESB.

The appearance is a slightly hazy medium gold hue with a micro white head. The aromas are a bit stale with a light hop dose. The flavors are the same. Pale malts, light hops.

M: The body is light with a pretty low level of carbonation. D: This one is alright if you like buttered toast with orange marmalade. Not really for me.

Nutty, spiced aroma, with Christmas notes throughout. Lots of forward flavour which tapers slowly through down the spices to a bitter finish.

Fantôme Blanche;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brasserie Fantôme;Аромат мощный и крутой. Очень много цитрусовых ноток, в частности большое количество корочки от апельсина и грейпфрута, немного лимонных ноток, также есть легкие кислые оттенки сена. Цвет классный, большая белоснежная и игривая пенка, много пузырей, цвет мутный, но не пос стилю. Вкус вообще не напоминает классический витбир. Сильное присутствие оттенков из другого стиля, а точнее сайзона. Немного сена и кислых ноток при глотке, также много цитрусовых, особенно грейпфрута. При послевкусие появляются четкие лимонные нотки. Пшенички почти не ощущается, хотя дрожжи есть. Весьма сильная и продолжительная фруктовая и немного травяная горечь. Она полностью и окончательно выбивает нас из классического витбира. В целом, это ни разу не пшеничка в бельгийском стиле, хотя само по себе пиво весьма интересное.

Nose is nicely roasty, some woody notes, grains, mild cocoa. Thin body, medium carbonation. Light mouthfeel, watery texture. Roasty bittersweet taste, somewhat empty.

Weatheroak Miss Stout;Studley, Warwickshire, England;Stout;Weatheroak Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Wild Boar, Warwick. Black with cream head. Quite a smooth beer for a stout, this had a slightly tart, fruitiness about it and it was sweeter than expected. It was reasonable, but I’m not sure i would label it as a stout.
Weatheroak Miss Stout;Studley, Warwickshire, England;Stout;Weatheroak Brewery;Loughborough Fest 05. Black with a bubbly white head. Aromas are earthy roast malts with berries and floral hops.

Weatheroak Miss Stout;Studley, Warwickshire, England;Stout;Weatheroak Brewery;Cask, at The Anchor, Birmingham. This seems far too hoppy to be a real Stout. Big fruit (blackcurrant) and hops all over your tongue and mouth, with some coffee on the finish. Goodish head, with thick lacing, but a little overpowering for my tastes.

Portsmouth Brewing Spartan Export;Portsmouth, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Portsmouth Brewing;"the beer discription claims it's ""a medium dark lager made with two row pale and munich malts"". the discription on the board seemed conflicted about whether this is a dortmunder or ""a true german oktoberfest"". what th?!? i think i can help a little bit: i don't know what it is, but it ain't no oktoberfest. pours a thin school bus yellow, and served with a modest head that ""diminished"" all the way to irrelevance. i'm no scholar of the dortmunder style, but this has vestiges of what i understand to be those qualities: brisk carb, un-caramelized cracker malts, starchy dryness, and an almost wishful-thinking impression of floral hops, though the later is clearly understated. seems like it is stronger than your typical lager. seems like a fair enough demi-dortmunder. seems like i won't be eager to try it again soon."

The Tap Merrimack Mild Ale;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Mild Ale;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Roasted malts and sugary sweetness in the nose. Opaque brown body with decent, off-white head that recedes to cover with light lacing. Flavour is quite roasty and salty and somewhat vinous. Astringent light body is appropriate for style but I’m not sure I could drink a whole lot of this. On tap at the brewpub with ClarkVV, MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere.
The Tap Merrimack Mild Ale;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Mild Ale;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;New England Road Trip Easter ’05 with MartinT, tiggmtl and Rastacouere, beer #22. Sample at the brewpub, joined by the locquacious and sagacious ClarkVV. Dark caramel, nose simple but explosive at first: enormous fresh coffee ground bitterness...slowly, bitter herbs show up and a touch of dark baker’s chocolate....in the body, dark roastiness and sour-bitter wine, light but impressive maltiness...somewhat watery, thinnish body seems appropriate...bitterness continues to the finish....I loved it.
The Tap Merrimack Mild Ale;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Mild Ale;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Dark orange, medium head. Strong coffee bean nose, nutty, leathery malt. Very leathery actually on the palate, it has a nice range of malt flavours which congregates toward a beany aftertaste. Light drinkable body, strong carbonation. Definitely not to style, but what can you do, it’s still pretty enjoyable and packs quite a punch.
The Tap Merrimack Mild Ale;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Mild Ale;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;A subtle balance of roasted malts, dates and cherries thrive elegantly within a rich mokaccino...A full mouthfeel serves the complex, filling flavors (for a mild) very efficiently, and even digs out an earthy floor...A lactic touch precedes a dry ending...
The Tap Merrimack Mild Ale;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Mild Ale;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;On draught at the brewery January 2005. Fabulous color for a mild. Dark amber/light burgundy red body, almost transluscent with a small off-white head. Aroma is surprisingly strong and smells of coffee beans, light tinges of dark caramel malt, brown sugar and a touch of anise and even some note of yeast. No hops in the aroma! Flavor starts out with a very apparent roast flavor. It’s light but yet so tastey. Mixes well with the soft malting and yet dosent overpower. Smooth, watery, but not thin, body. I’m not very experienced at describing mild ales, but I do know that this stuff was fantastic. It just hit the right flavor notes and didnt leave anything in there that shouldnt have been. No excessive sweetness, little to no hops. Lightly bitter/sour yeast is present on the finish. Probably my favorite sample during my visit. Reminds me of Dragonmead’s Crusader Dark Mild, though less astringent/dry and has a better balance.

The Tap Merrimack Mild Ale;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Mild Ale;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Not sure what to think about this one. Taste is like a watered down brown ale. Very sweet. If I want a brown ale at The Tap, I wil have their normal brown ale.

Aroma brings out a light chocolate sense, along with fresh espresso, and somewhere in there I get a hint at vanilla. The main flavors are mild, blending coffee, espresso, and roast. Fairly velvety smooth on the palate, a nicely done little hop kick finishes out this balanced coffee/espresso beer. A slightly burnt lingering flavor continues to ride out after each sip as well. I’m starting to notice that all of Barley Brown’s beers are BALANCED, and every once in a while that rocks! 3 for 3 these guys get from me!

Sharp coffee aroma with a light nuttiness. The aroma more reminiscent of fresh coffee grounds rather than brewed coffee. Coffee bitterness up front, backed by some roasted malts.

Last Drop Light Lager;Canning Vale, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Last Drop Brewery;Tap at Clancy’s City Beach. Now I’m NOT a lager guy but... Gotta say, this is up my alley! Doesn’t look like a lager - coppery colour - doesn’t really taste like lager - quite hoppy and heavier bodied. Almost a pale ale (English style) in taste but lower on malt - which is why I like it. Would drink again no worries.

Asda Extra Pilsner;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Asda (Wal Mart);Asda Extra Pilsner in a 500ml silver coloured can. Very cheap normally, and a case of 12 in the reduced section in my local Asda for £4.00 forced my hand. Highly carbonated. Lacking in meaningfully pleasant flavours, this is a metallic and vegatal fizz bomb that while not being completely offensive, is certainly well over the neutral line. Not good.
Asda Extra Pilsner;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Asda (Wal Mart);Looks like Duvel: pale straw color and huge thick solid head. The contents are less impressive: slightly malty, watery with no hoppy bitterness.

Tastes malty and strong, also spicy and smoky. Interesting beer. For me a mix between schwarzbier, bockbier and a smoked beer.

Falter Kellerbier;Hof-Unterkotzau, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Falter Hof;(bottle) Slightly hazy, mahogany colour with a fluffy, moderately persistent off-white foamy head, leaving some lace. Sweet, slightly dusty toast-malty aroma with toffee and a light hoppy touch, also whiffs of fruitiness. Sweet flavour with a faint touch of acidity in the background, medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Toasty malty taste with toffee on a light herbal background. Sweet and a bit acidic finish with toasty and light herbal hoppy notes. According to the given 6.2% abv I expected a kind of Kellerbier-Bock but received just a bit stronger, still drinkable but also rather disappointing Kellerbier.
Falter Kellerbier;Hof-Unterkotzau, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Falter Hof;bottled. brown purple. plum aroma, very dark for a kellerbier. starts quite bland but developed some sultana and vanilla flavours as it warmed and a lightly prickly finish. melt in the mouth texture, surprisingly little sign of alcohol for a stronger kellerbier
Falter Kellerbier;Hof-Unterkotzau, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Falter Hof;Is called Kellerbier or Kellertrunk, but is mostly a dunkel - only cloudiness if you really work on the yeast in the bottom of the bottle. Lacks other features of a keller/land brew. Sugary malty aroma and acidic note a bit like cola. Brown, low carbonation, no head. Sugary tastenotes - dust, malt edges and citric acidic notes almost bordering to infection. Otherwise nothing - watery. According to the bottletext is the beer a old recipe tuned to the taste of today....no comment.

Light bodied with clean, rounded mouthfeel. The hop flavour is somewhat odd, and there are cellary notes. Low to medium bitterness. Firm for having such low gravity.

Lighthouse Brewery Haulashore Bitter;Nelson, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lighthouse Brewery (NZ);"Tasted 20/06/2005. 500ml bottle from Regional’s, Wellington. Rose gold, very little carbonation. Velvety, just off-white, head. Lacey and diminishing. Nose is of orange pith, candi sugar, wood and is slightly spicey; peppery at first with aniseed hints later. Flavour is hop driven at first, a peppery and zesty citrus bitterness, with a malt sweetness coming through later as it warms up a little (started drinking it a cellar temp). Quite lightweight in the mouth but that is to be expected at 3.6%. A touch tingley on the palate. Nice quaffer."

Founders Inn Cider;Nelson, New Zealand;Apple Cider;Founders Brewery (Independent Breweries NZ);if nothing else, this at least let me know that my back teeth are still there. ridiculously tart, but also fresh and with no trace of alcohol in the taste - i assumed it was a well-disguised 4% cider and was surprised to find it was nearly double that. one of those beers that's easier to respect than to enjoy but i used to think that of cantillon and now i enjoy it so who knows? tastes like there's plenty of skin in there though it was clear. with a few more tart cider tastings under my belt, i think i could really get to like this
Founders Inn Cider;Nelson, New Zealand;Apple Cider;Founders Brewery (Independent Breweries NZ);2002 vintage if that means anything. smells and tastes of unripe granny smith. after you get used to the gutchurning sourness it tastes like eating the core of an apple, seeds and all, with a slight meaty gaminess. main taste is full on sourness though, this beats most lambics, with the possible exception of cantillon.

OCCASION: hot (literally) off a good 4.65 mile run and in need of something to refuel me... GLASSWARE: Hobgoblin pint... pours a vociferous four-finger white wall of head that froths above and bubbles below... lively copper yellow body that is just a tint or two darker than the can's label--almost like a rich pilsner... bright citrus--mostly lemon--tangling with clove, peppery spices, and light banana.. its sweet toasted biscuit is prominent as well, giving it a backbone without compromising its mission... this sips with a husky breath, not a lightweight in its mouthfeel, even if its 4.4% ABV is no stumbling block to slamming it... I like the simmer at the throat, its sizzle at the tongue; nothing really to report at the teeth... grainy, refreshing, with a tart finish and a lingering, resinous texture... the lemon and biscuit make a solid platform on which the spiciness builds like a Hallertau missile... the fragrant meadow is also in effect, with lilac and lavender making this a botanical experience... this breezes in, makes a positive impression, and refreshes on it sway out... this hit the spot on a warm end-of-summer Sunday, and I hope to have another next year, however unlikely a trip to Vermont may be..."

Taste is biscuit, floral hops, light honey, grass, the tiniest hint of lemon, and a touch of grapefruit in the finish. Very light pils malt bitterness. Light+ body. Average carbonation. Crisp mouthfeel. Incredibly drinkable.
Alchemist Lightweight;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Alchemist;Cereal, herbs and citrus in nose. Pours golden with white head. Taste is medium dry with cereal, citrus and herbs. Low to medium bitter finish, lively carbo. Overall decent at best.
Alchemist Lightweight;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Alchemist;While Blonde beers don't do much for me, I could drink ungodly amounts of this stuff. It's downright crushable. This gold-colored beer benefits from a simple setup - crisp, clean malt and fresh citrusy hops. Maybe the reason I like this Blonde Ale so much is that its German pils malt and mildly bitter finish makes me think of something more along the lines of a German Lager like Helles rather than a Blonde. So I guess I'm saying that this is a Blonde Ale that doesn't taste like a Blonde Ale? I don't know. Just go with it.
Alchemist Lightweight;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Alchemist;Can - pours gold white head - nose and taste of bread malt, lemon - light and crisp
Alchemist Lightweight;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;The Alchemist;Tallboy can by Joe. Poured a super hazy super bright straw with a smaller foamy bright white head. Aroma of corn, crackers, flowers, lavender and yeast. Flavor is the same as the aroma plus flower stems and grains. Medium mouthfeel, softer to average carbonation, creamy overall and a quicker fading aftertaste.
Alchemist Donovans Red;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Alchemist;"At big Seth’s going away party on 11/2/2013; was an awesome day! Aroma is earth hop. Flavor is thin, watery, bitter, gross. This is a huge miss."
Alchemist Donovans Red;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Alchemist;"Thanks Daniel! Gorgeous color, head, lace. Hoppy nose seeps onto the palate alongside red malts and steeped tea. A little more mild on the palate than I'd like; bring me more flavor and we'll talk. Interesting, though, and glad I got to try it."
Alchemist Donovans Red;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Alchemist;From 10/26 notes. Growler purchased from the brewery 10/23, drank three days later. Pours a muddy, murky light brown with 1 finger head. Not really red at all. This is not a very visually appealing beer. Nose is earthy greens with some subtle fruity, grassy notes. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but with decent carbonation. Taste is vegetal, some hoppy pine notes, salad, greens, hints of butter. Finish is mild bitter, watery, vegetal, leafy. Honesty this was a disappointment, overall it’s kind of a mess. I would probably pass on this one, in its current form, if given the chance again.
Alchemist Donovans Red;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Alchemist;Poured to the growler from Jk himself. Great to get other beers from Alchemist but American red ale isn't my ideal beer. If it is, good color, good dirty finish. Tastes great and is a good start before you finish with a HT. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Alchemist Donovans Red;Stowe, Vermont, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Alchemist;On tap at the brewpub on November 4, 2010. Pours an amber-red color with a good light tan head. A finger or two worth with some bits of lace here and there. The nose brings out quite a bit of toasted bread, caramel, and some light dough. Amber malt in there as well. Some very light earthy and floral hops. The flavor is just really, really nice. This is insanely malty and flavorful for the alcohol level. Caramel and bread crust plus a bit of toast and a nice earthiness to round things out. Great body with a very nice level of bitterness. A very quaffable brew. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 11-14-2010

GLASSWARE: HopDevil nonick... pours a motor oil black body and a thick, pillowed two-fingered brown head that laces with an engaging pattern of frill... chocolate and peat are strong, while vanilla bean and toasted bread malts further elicit the first sip... speaking of which, its brackish mouthfeel is medium-bodied, chewy enough to suggest its hops, and smooth at its finish... something like a sweet stout in its flavor profile, with rich chocolate, pleasing peat, earthy vegetable, and lingering, understate citrus... this is pretty much what a porter should be, though its flavors are succinct, pronounced clearly, and worthwhile...

Bobcat Cafe Bristol Pride;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a bronzed golden amber color with a thin yet lasting head that dissipated at a nice pace. No lacing. The aroma had the normal qualities of an ESB, creamy sweet bready to biscuity tones with some clean fruity esters. The flavor cleanly produces the malty sweetness with some crisp nuttiness and then the fruity esters to balance. Exceptionally clean sweet malty aftertaste with a light grassy sweetness in there as well. Quick semi-sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionable smooth sweet crisp feel to it. Carbonation rides fairly easy. Smooth sweet semi-creamy effects flow over my tongue nicely. Overall, as an ESB it works and I would have again. Pass the fish n’ chips.
Bobcat Cafe Bristol Pride;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;Oaked orange appearance. Sticky head. Aroma of not much. Hard to detect much. So bitter. And dank. Just chewy without a lot of malt. Touch of sweetness at the finish.

Bobcat Cafe Bristol Pride;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;In short: A cranked up but true-to-the style ESB. Wonderful session beer How: Tap at brewpub The look: Clear dark golden body topped by a small white head In long: Strong nose of leafy hops. Nice malts with plenty of cereals and tasty caramel without feeling sweet. Light fruity presence with just a hint of grapefruits and berries. Superb semi-dry finish with plenty of leafy hops. With many beers on the menu I ordered this one twice. Highly drinkable is an understatement. Your first pint of this won’t last you 5 minutes and you’ll need to order a second one to take your notes. At least that’s what happened to me. Bristol being the little lost village that it is I say this is indeed Bristol Pride. It used to be THE traffic light but now it’s this beer.

Bobcat Cafe Bristol Pride;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;The Lure: An ochre garment relinquishes quaint red fruit sweetness and earthy malts. As with all of their beers that day, but a fine head greets us to soon disappear into the beer. The Festivities: Sinuous caramel aptly surrounds the peach-yielding yeast as a light body with prickly, small-bubbled effervescence induces some dryness towards the end. A worty presence hangs around the nondescript hop bitterness, while yeast flavors are prolonged. Transcendence: A courteous grin and a noble handshake make for a pleasant but unmemorable moment.

Bobcat Cafe Bristol Pride;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;"On tap at cafe. Clear medium bronze, very creamy lasting head. Very fruity (cherries, apples), malty aroma takes a while to get going; at first I thought the temp was ok, but this really needs to get warm. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, with acidic grapefruity hops just strong enough to make a nice finishing impression. Smoky herbal notes towards the end; wet pine needles and oregano smoking on a campfire. Another winner from the Bobcat, joining a crowded field of top-notch Vermont bitters."

Well-rounded, dry and slightly vegetal/herbal finish...pumpkin stew. Could be a bit fuller, but a marvellous Octoberfest overall.
Grand View Mac Jack Hard Cider;East Calais, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Grand View Winery;On Tap at three Penny Taproom. Haven’t seen this one on tap in a long time. $5 for a pint. Looks like every other cider Smell is bright. Simple apple. No other spices. Maybe a bit sweeter? Very sweet. Not very dry. Maybe some cinnamon? Bard to tell. It’s a standard drinkable cide.
Grand View Mac Jack Hard Cider;East Calais, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Grand View Winery;Poured at a wine tasting at the winery. Very light color, small head. tastes like appley champagne. not my favorite cider, but would probably be a good food cider.
Grand View Mac Jack Hard Cider;East Calais, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Grand View Winery;Mild apple aroma, lightest yellow, tastes of apples, pleasantly sweet, fair. Thanks Dave Steen.
Grand View Mac Jack Hard Cider;East Calais, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Grand View Winery;Bomber from the cidery, purchased March 2005 and drunk on 7/9/06. Some ring of bubbles hesitates to form and then is gone. A clear, filtered, light straw body shows minimal carbonation and no legs. In the nose, dry, golden apples commit to neither sweetness nor dry acidity, but remain quite perfumey, peppery and only lightly sweet. Nearly champagne-like, with traces of sulfur or something like that. Still, for a 5 month old bottle that is sulfited and filtered, this is quite surprisingly decent. As it warms, some alcohol comes to the front of the aroma, but mixes with the dry pear-skin-like notes to soften somewhat. Dry and attenuated, the flavor definitely stands away from any sweetness or alcohol. Granted, there is little to no complexity, just a monotonous golden delicious skin-like flavor with some light white pepper and white-wine-yeast notes. Low carbonation and well-hidden alcohol in the flavor keep things clean, while a bite of dry apples helps keep things somewhat crisp.
Grand View Mac Jack Hard Cider;East Calais, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Grand View Winery;22oz bottle shared by CLarkvv. Pours a pale yellow hazy color with no head. Nose is apples and has a white wine feel to it. Palate is dry, light on the tongue, and crisp. Flavor is apples, a nice crispness, some dry notes, fairly simple and clean.
Grand View Mac Jack Hard Cider;East Calais, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Grand View Winery;Bottle shared with a bunch of folks at Doug’s - courtesy of Dave. Pale yellow colour. Aroma tart and light, with some stale white wine notes. Flavour is wine-like as well, with simple dry apple notes - lacks character, and the alcohol is more noticible than it should be for a 5% cider.
Grand View Mac Jack Hard Cider;East Calais, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Grand View Winery;Bottle. Pours a clear pale white colour with no head. Appley sugar aroma, alcohol, and rather dull/watery. Light body with sugary soft apple flavour. Clean finish. Mediocre.
Grand View Mac Jack Hard Cider;East Calais, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Grand View Winery;"Item #3 at June 2006 Toronto cider/mead -fest - bottle from Dave. Very pale yellow, flat-looking. Aroma of faint apple, mild ketones and very young chablis. Taste is very simple - tart apple and sweet ""green"" white wine. Soft mouthfeel - light, slick and just a little fizzy - this one was just okay, had an odd boozy-bitter finish to me, unusual for a 5%"
Grand View Mac Jack Hard Cider;East Calais, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Grand View Winery;Bottle at Doug’s, thanks Dave. Muted aroma, not great - stale apple. Very light, no head. Taste is better - tangy apple, tart, light carbonation. Not too bad.
Grand View Mac Jack Hard Cider;East Calais, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Grand View Winery;Bottle. Light straw yellow with no head. Fruity moderate apple aroma. Bit of a tart finish to the flavour, light fruity apple. Average palate. Bit flat? Pleasant but a touch bland.
Miel Nature Rose et Épines;Beauharnois, Quebec, Canada;Mead;Miel Nature;Robe de teinte rose saumoné de bonne intensité. Nez exubérant d’où émanent des parfums de miel de rose et de mûre. Découvrez cet hydromel demi-sec démontrant une bonne acidité. Fidèle aux arômes perçus à l’olfaction, il s’affirme par des saveurs de rose. Il a une texture presque grasse qui précède une finale persistante. SAQ
Miel Nature Rose et Épines;Beauharnois, Quebec, Canada;Mead;Miel Nature;Out of a 750ml, one of the 9 meads produced by Miel Nature. This pours a hazy reddish pink with no head at all. The aroma is heavily sweet honey with raspberry and herbal notes. Taste is a little too sweet, they suggest serving it cold, but I imagine it must be cloying. Warm, it remains heavily sweet, too much for my liking. Nevertheless I capt those rose petals flavors and they're pretty interesting and original together with obvious clover honey. Medium flat body. I know it's not to style, but I'd be curious to try this carbonated to see if it appears as sweet because for now it is pretty straightforward.
The Cowboy Double Barrel Barley Wine;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;The beer pours a bit hazy brown with a modest tan head that is semi-creamy in texture, the lace a fine concealing sheet. Nose has a phenol or if you prefer medicinal aroma, sweet malt dominates with hints of caramel and the start nicely malted, quite sweet with the top moderate in its feel. Finish is brisk in its carbonation and the hops pleasingly mild, somewhat dry aftertaste that lingers on and on, just a bit strange tasting, and I don’t think it was infected, just odd as several of us noted while sampling this beer?
The Cowboy Double Barrel Barley Wine;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Cowboy Restaurant & Brewery;Another great beer from this unheralded brewery in Scottsdale. Bottle 136 of 400. Rich aroma of ripe fruit, vanilla, oak, malt, bourbon, and alcohol. Pours a red-amber, minimal head. Flavor has all of the aroma in it, finishes slightly bitter. Very smooth, full-bodied, slightly warming. Outstanding barleywine!

Dick's Belgian Style Witbier;Centralia, Washington, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Dick's Brewing Company;Another gem from the sampler pack from the brewery, and my first new beer for RateBeer.com!!! Pours a hazy golden color with quite a bit of carbonation bubbles and a nice head, but little lacing. The aroma is very fruity with a hint of wheat. Taste is interesting. I'm not a wheat fan but this is great. Banana esters are very prevelant. Mouthfeel is light but foamy, and quite refreshing. Overall this is quite nice. I love this brewery.

Lighthouse Brewery Dicks Dark;Nelson, New Zealand;Mild Ale;Lighthouse Brewery (NZ);The head is good, the body almost black. It smells maltaromatic, darkmalty, special, a bit fruity, raisins. The taste is mild a bit darkmalty and fruity. The first smell is good, the rest a bit to mild. 3.3
Lighthouse Brewery Dicks Dark;Nelson, New Zealand;Mild Ale;Lighthouse Brewery (NZ);500ml bottle. Ruby copper in colour with a very large thick beige head with red flecks through it. Mild aroma with malty caramel notes that are pleasant, light and airy. Flavour is mildly bitter and a bit tart and vinergary but light on the palate.

Lighthouse Brewery Dicks Dark;Nelson, New Zealand;Mild Ale;Lighthouse Brewery (NZ);Pours dark brown with red highlights, thick white head that persists down the glass. Nose of toffee apples, rich dark choc and a smidge of roasted malt. Lovely dark fruit flavour with dark chocolate overtones. Some coffee and a slight bitterness in the finish. Very smooth and drinkable.
Lighthouse Brewery Dicks Dark;Nelson, New Zealand;Mild Ale;Lighthouse Brewery (NZ);It’s a dark mild! Initially I was a little disappointed, but I warmed to its toasty complexity and caramel overtones, although the initial hit had some buttery diacetyl going on. A tasty beer, but nothing I’d write home about. I think I need more to be sure.
Lighthouse Brewery Dicks Dark;Nelson, New Zealand;Mild Ale;Lighthouse Brewery (NZ);(Bottle 50 cl) Clear, orangey brown with a small, rough, off-white head. Unclean, malty, nutty aroma - very British. Light in body but rich in flavours, lots of nuts in particular but also some burned caramel. Somewhat burned malt bitter finish. Appears more like an ESB to me. 010208
Lighthouse Brewery Dicks Dark;Nelson, New Zealand;Mild Ale;Lighthouse Brewery (NZ);Tasted in New Zealand. Rough head. Nice brown color. Roasted taste. Bitter aftertaste.
Lighthouse Brewery Dicks Dark;Nelson, New Zealand;Mild Ale;Lighthouse Brewery (NZ);Reasonably dark, gentle roasted nose, fine, creamy, thin holding head. Reasonable taste & bitterness. Best described as gentle coffee - perhaps a white decaf! Quite a thin palate. A good dark quaffer.
Lighthouse Brewery Dicks Dark;Nelson, New Zealand;Mild Ale;Lighthouse Brewery (NZ);Bottled. Mahogany colour, firm head. Aroma of roasty malt. Dry with soft mouthfeel. Very salty with selnder body. Roasty malt dominates. A straight forward beer with some grassy bitterness and slight notes of metal in the finish.
McMenamins Aero-Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Sweet coffee and amaretto aroma. Lots of sweet roasted malts, chocolate and vanilla flavors. A decent, thick porter.
Bluegrass Schwarzbier;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Tap at brewpub. Lightly smokey molasses and chocolate malt aroma. Dark black color with small head. Slightly sweet molasses, chocolate malt and moderately bitter grassy hops flavor. Very good.
Bluegrass Schwarzbier;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Black with dark brown edges disappearing light brown head. interesting aroma....mocha and hay. bitter coffee flavor with sweet honey hay undertones. bitter dry grassy finish. light body moderate carbonation. nice. based on the other ratings im gonna have to go back and give this one another try......maybe i didnt dig deep enough.
Bluegrass Schwarzbier;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draft at St. Matthews brewpub. Dark brown color with medium off-white fizzy head that diminished slowly with fair lacing. Medium roasted malt aroma with a sweet tone. Medium body. Medium flavor of roasted malt with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Interesting solid brew.
Bluegrass Schwarzbier;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bluegrass Brewing Company;This was a great session beer that I drank all afternoon watching football at the BBC brew-pub. It’s not often that I’ll stick to a single variety while at a good brew-pub, but this beer was so delicious and drinkable that I just had to. The appearance was somewhat darker than other Schwarzbiers I’ve had, but still had the clarity that sets this style’s appearance apart from stouts and porters. Very nice dark ruby brown. Smell was mild but tempting. It was enough to draw me in and desire a taste, but not something that was a joy in and of itself. The taste was where it was at. And, to me, that is the most important part. This was everything that a schwarzbier is supposed to be. I have loved Kozstriker and Sam Adams Black, and I loved this just as much or more. I imagine the freshness was what gave it that extra edge. Top notch beer. I wish they would bottle it.
Bluegrass Schwarzbier;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Diminishing light brown head tops the dark cola brown hue. A true definition of the style meets the nosrils. Middle of the way toasted to burn bready malts procure coffee and powdered cocoa flavours that are accompanied by a faint molasses whisper which made me think of bear paws cookies. Talkative blackberry hints, also a bit grapey, but defying the lager complexity spectrum. Light oily body, soft carbonation, no acidity, noteworthy balance. A demonstration of craftsmanship.
Bluegrass Schwarzbier;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Tap: The was talking too much with the locals to take a lot of notes, so this will be brief...again served too cold and had to let warm. Opaque with a nice beige frothy head and good lace. The nose detected mocha, smoke, apple and minor yeast esters. The taste had a lot of chocolate malt over a light fruity twang followed by a smoky bitterness on the finish. The feel was fizzy and watery, bone dry finish. A darn nice bier, malty without being sticky. Drank way too quickly.
Bluegrass Schwarzbier;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bluegrass Brewing Company;"Hand bottled from TAR, this pours with a consistent lovely head on top of a still, very black medium body. Roastiness is everywhere, toasted, a bit burnt, not bitter. Some schwarzes are a bit watery; this is not - it’s assertive in every way. Grainy huskiness, and with a good spice to the smoke, this is the best Swarzbier I can imagine. Crisper than any version I’ve had - this takes it slightly afield of style perhaps."
Bluegrass Schwarzbier;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Strong, malty smoked aroma. Not overpowering but definitely assertive. Bold, sweet yet bittersweet. Toasty. Develops fully in finish, moves slowly from sweet to dry. Slightly sour, somehow, maybe a little licorice? Better on cask.
Bluegrass Schwarzbier;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draft: Black with a ruby tint. Sandy/creamy mocha foam becomes rocky and leaves sticky lace. Gorgeous nose of roasted malt and minerals with hints of char, black licorice, coffee, cinnamon, and molasses. Creamy, densely packed bubbles. Mellow, yet captivatingly flavorsome, feathery malt frame anchors notes of roasted wood and black licorice. Hints of vanilla and anise give way to a soft stream of grainy malt textures. Gritty cocoa and charred malts deepen the savory mocha smoothness. Heightening malt richness is underpinned with smoke, burnt matchsticks, and understated char, but the ease of the body quickly beckons you to take another sip. Tangy mineral underlay persists throughout and balances the sweetness while accentuating the spicy black licorice snap. Interplay of bittersweet chocolate and chalky-tinged malts. Dabs of husky malts arise late. Roasted barley discharges more acidity and bitterness toward the finish, replacing the muted hop presence, which also helps offset the richness of the lingering array of rich maltiness. Quintessential session black lager and textbook to style.
Bluegrass Schwarzbier;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Good roasted/smoked aroma. Hint of smoke comes through in the nicely balanced slightly malty body. I wish I had an empty growler with me.

Drakes Harvest Ale;San Leandro, California, United States;IPA;Drakes Brewing Company;On tap @ the brewery. What I remember most about this brew was the extremely dry and slightly bitter finish.

The aroma is very light with faint sweet malts and roastiness. I had a hard time picking up much hoppiness in the nose. The taste is malty with sweet roasted malts and caramelization.

Drakes Harvest Ale;San Leandro, California, United States;IPA;Drakes Brewing Company;Draught sample at O’Brien’s, San Diego. Hazy reddish-orange colour. I was pretty hopped out after the Hoppiness, Pliny and Dorado, so I don’t think I was able to give this a fair tasting, but as far as hop-bombs go, it’s a pretty good one. I was glad to move on to some new styles after this one, though.

Drakes Blonde Ale;San Leandro, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Drakes Brewing Company;"4.8%ABV.  Kolsch. Poured out of the bottle a cloudy blonde.  6ºSRM. Nose is full of wheaty, beery, slighty yeasty aromas.  Very ""lager-like"" nose. No hops. Mouthfeel is light and sudsy.  Aggresively carbonated.  Palate is raw dough, wheat flour, water biscuits.  There is brief lemon sourness to the palate lending it some depth. Nice clean abbreviated hop finish. For me this drank more like a witbier than a Kolsch."

Fredericksburg Hoppy Holidaze;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;On tap at brewery on January 17, 2009. I had high hopes for this one... Cloudy/solid red color. Hop/malt/spice aroma. Anise or cinnamon, maybe? Bubbly on the surface. Bitter flavor but not too compelling, all in all. Good, but too thin. Needs more alcohol to make this a better, and more enjoyable winter warmer.

Less pronounced as it warms up."
Fredericksburg Hoppy Holidaze;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;Tap. Quite a firm IPA and not bad at all. About as hoppy as I like ’em these days and is decently balanced, a la Elissa IPA with the needle pointing a little more towards hops than maltiness. A pine-laden hiking trail in the aroma and some nice caramel and twig in addition to the usual IPA stuff in the flavor. Goodness.
Fredericksburg Hoppy Holidaze;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;what can i say i’m not a fan of hops. the bartender told me it was a barley wine so i thought i’d give it a shot.

Hints of pine and herb in the mix. Well made holiday beer. Good job Rick.
Fredericksburg Hoppy Holidaze;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;From Humolone Red’s growler. Medium to dark brown color, clear, medium-sized head. The aroma is nice with fresh hops, caramel and some alcohol. The flavor has a nice balance of bitterness with flavor hops (my favorite combo of hops, i.e. not all bittering). However, it gets more bitter as it warms. There is also a hint of sage but maybe that is coming from the hops? Not sure. Good beer if you are in the Texas Hill Country during the Hoildaze!

White Winter Raspberry Mead;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;White Winter Winery;[Bottle] Pours clear, light red. Aroma isn’t bad, but is kind of strange. Notes of raspberry, but also a herbal, weedy aroma, with some alcohol, and very faint rubber. The aroma improves with time, with the expected honey and rapsberry taking over the longer I let it sit. Taste is a little hot, but not bad, with lots of raspberry blending nicely with the honey. Well done. Decent mouthfeel, long finish. Overall, the aroma is a little lacking, and it isn’t overly complex, but it is still a solid mead.
White Winter Raspberry Mead;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;White Winter Winery;Bottle. Pour was light ruby with a nice lace. Had on ice. I got much more flavor from the warm sweet mead I had from White Winter. Light but fresh raspberry flavors. Decent but more like a mixed drink. Needs a much bigger honey background.

White Winter Raspberry Mead;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;White Winter Winery;Sampled at the White Winter Winery. Body that reminded me of a French Rose wine.

Actually, I pointed to the Nor’wester thinking that I would get the stout, which is a Sou’wester. I only came to realise when I got the glass (less than a pint) that it was a pale ale. Now I don’t know if it was the savagery of that great concert that made me enjoy this even more, but this strong beer was pretty damn wicked! Fruity and dry, well packed together in a pleasant drinking experience, that’s all I remember. Something that surely I must try again.
Dux de Lux Nor Wester - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;The Dux Brewing Co.;Lovely coppery amber colour with a transient white head that doesn’t appear to hang around. I’m not sure what it is about the aroma that puts me in mind of authentic German yeast strains. There’s a fruit salad quality to the aroma on top of bready malts. Enticing. Then there’s the taste. I was always a fan of this style anyway so it was going to be popular. It delivered on my expectation having muscle, gorgeous orangey malt flavours and a soft bitterness. A thoroughly enjoyable pale ale and easily my favourite from the Dux stable. Best of luck with the rebuild chaps.
Dux de Lux Nor Wester - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;The Dux Brewing Co.;Bottled. A dark amber beer with a light tan head. The aroma has strong notes of caramel combined with notes of malt. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt, caramel, and bread, leading to a dry finish, where the caramel note lingers.
Dux de Lux Nor Wester - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;The Dux Brewing Co.;Aroma: Malt--hints of bread, cereal, chocolate, and coffee (very slight). Hops-- grass (but very minimal). Appearance: reddish brown, clear with no particulate matter and a small frothy head and medium lacing, off white colour. Taste: no hint of sweetness, distinctive hoppy bitterness with slight hint of sourness. Palate: Full bodied with creamy texture (light), very little carbonation and a bitter, sour finish that lingers somewhat. Overall a very nice pale ale, rather complex.
Dux de Lux Nor Wester - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;The Dux Brewing Co.;Bottle from WCNW... For a strong ale, this one is quite nice... Needs a little more balance, but overall a fairly pleasant drop. nate2g...0.9 Total Score? Really? Why rate it? Maybe you should have told them at the time it was infected... that way they could go about fixing the problem...
Dux de Lux Nor Wester - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;The Dux Brewing Co.;Very nice colour - almost perfect copper. Not much aroma at all. Flavour is all dry maltyness with limited citrus and fruity - hop character. Nice but not sensational.
Dux de Lux Nor Wester - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;The Dux Brewing Co.;Hints of caramel mixed with the dried fruit in the taste, alcohol also a bit noticeable. Body is a reddy amber with an off-white head. Finish is sometimes heavy and cloying then sometimes thin aand watery.
Dux de Lux Nor Wester - 2014;Christchurch, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;The Dux Brewing Co.;Draft at Dux de Lux in Queenstown. Pours copper with a medium eggshell head. Hops, caramel malt, pine, and alcohol make up the aroma. The flavor follows suit, along with fruit and wood. Light-medium bodied. Crisp, with a bite at the end. Lacks the balance that would help it match up better in this style. However, I did like this one better than most of the other DDL offerings I tried.
Brewbakers Wee Heavy Scotch Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Brewbakers Brewing Company;Clouded reddish brown, decent head formation. Malty fruity aroma with a herbal peppery spice. Sweet and fruity in flavor but not much body or strength.
Goku Karakuchi Sumiyoshi Junmai Sake;Higashi-okitama-gun, YAMAGATA Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Taruhei Shuzo Co., Ltd.;"300mL bottle from a Whole Foods somewhere in CA. Label says ""Three years aged sake."" Very pale watered down urine off-white with some pretty long developing legs. Nose of muskmelon, fruity rice, light almond and alcohol--kinda sweet overall. Flavor hits you right up front with what I thought was bitterness, but might possibly have been some wood and a pretty good amount of alcohol heat. Not very smooth going down. I do get some of the fruitiness, but the alcohol and woodiness just go Rawr! and beat it down. Fusel alcohol finish, bone dry. Medium to full bodied. Not one of the better sakes I’ve had. I was excited to try it though!"
Miyozakura Junmai Sake;Japan;Saké - Junmai;Miyozakura Shuzo Co., Ltd.;"180ml cute Panda & Bamboo Cup, as ""Miyozakura Jumai Cup"" from Oak Barrel, Sydney. 15.5%. Very pale yellow-green colour, no head and aroma of rice, melon. Taste is rice, nutty and earthy, with boozy grassy notes. Medium bodied, low carbonation, dry warm earthy boozy finish. Nicely drinkable."
Wisconsin Dells Black Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Nice dark roasted chocolate malt aroma. Deep dark red body. Thin ring of off-white head. Flavor is of lactose. Dark chocolate, dry. More stoutish than porterish. Not overly enjoyable, but not bad.
Wisconsin Dells Black Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Translucent, deep brown with scarlet accents. Aroma is cocoa powder and caramel soda syrup. Flavor confirms aroma suspicions, along with new elements of oats, maple and brown sugar. Hop profile is lower than I’d like. All in all, a standard brewpub porter.
Wisconsin Dells Black Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Dark with no head. Nose is thin hops and malts with just a tab of coffee and chocolate towards the back. The taste is just about the same but softer and less interesting. As bland as I found this I was suprised that others liked this one.
Wisconsin Dells Black Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub/restaurant in the Wisconsin Dells. Pours a dark black with a nice mocha colored head. Some fresh lake water accents in the aroma, no tmuch else. Has somewhat of a malty bent to it, but overall quite bland, but not ad tasting. Has hints of chocolate and coffee, but you really need to seek them out. Hints of licorice sweetens it up a bit more. Decent mouthfeel.
Wisconsin Dells Black Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;Deep dark clear mohagany. Head is a spongy light cocoa color. Aromas of dark chocolate and light coffee. Roasted malts and light mocha flavors. Somewhat like a schwartz ale with a few more hops.
Wisconsin Dells Black Ale;Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;Wisconsin Dells Brewing Co.;I had this at the brewpub on 12/27, 3 days after it was available according to the bartender that served me. The draught glass was dark (limited lighting) with a nice looking creamy head that sustained well and with good lace. The aroma was quite roasty and hop like. The flavor was of roasted malt and a good hop balance with a real nice body. Overall, I really liked it.
Mac's Stoney Red Cider;Auckland, New Zealand;Apple Cider;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I’m rating this from memory. As I recall it was on the lighter side of the colour spectrum with plenty of evident carbonation when had off tap. Not the sweetest cider, but not quite off-dry either and lacking in body. Not a favourite cider, but not a bad session brew and popular with cider drinking tourists.
Mac's Stoney Red Cider;Auckland, New Zealand;Apple Cider;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Oh well, lets have a cider for a change. Bloody hell, should have asked them to serve it without what seems to be additional tablespoon of sugar in it.
Mac's Stoney Red Cider;Auckland, New Zealand;Apple Cider;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);much as i like to encourage motel's cider renaissance i don't think he has to wade through crap like this just so he can say he likes cider. ridiculously sweet, like applejuice cordial, with a little bit of tartness but not nearly enough. slightly medicinal.
Mac's Stoney Red Cider;Auckland, New Zealand;Apple Cider;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);i'm glad i got around to tasting a few ciders in new zealand - this became my session drink for a couple of long hot afternoons spent watching cricket. ruby red, tasty and tart, full red apple taste with a little unwelcome tomato juice in the finish. too sweet to not get sick of but a step up from the usual nz macro brown ale
Mauldons Eatanswill Old;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Mauldons;Very good and what I would class as a winter ale, but at the same time quite light in taste. Would recommend this.
Mauldons Eatanswill Old;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Mauldons;Backlog rating. From cask at the Chelmsford Winter Beer & Cider Festival, February 2016.
Mauldons Eatanswill Old;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Mauldons;Cask at the Liberty Belle, Ely as ’Old Firkin’. Dark brown, flat at first but somehow a little bit of tan head surfaces about 3 minutes later. Weird. Aroma of dried kindling, espresso, chicory, a note of dark chocolate. Bitter taste rounded by a sweet fruity edge. Chalky bitter finish and aftertaste.
Mauldons Eatanswill Old;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Mauldons;Cask (handpump) @ Market Porter, 9 Stoney Street, Southwark, London, Greater London, England SE1 9AA. Clear medium to dark brown colour with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, roasted, caramel, chocolate. Flavor is moderate sweet and light bitter with a average to long duration, soft dark roasted, smoke notes. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft to flat. [20120115]
Mauldons Eatanswill Old;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Mauldons;Cask (CWAF2012, Fri) Superb sweet plummy dark fruits in the aroma. Taste full and a little bit smokey roasty. Long rich finish. Superb at 4%, as this comes over as a winter warmer with its fullness and succulence.
Mauldons Eatanswill Old;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Mauldons;Cask conditioned at The Turf Tavern, Oxford. Dark brown with slight head. Tartish malty, fruity beer, not sure whether it is meant to be like this or just on its last legs. A little dull overall.
Mauldons Eatanswill Old;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Mauldons;Cask, handpump at The Crosse Keys, Thame, Oxon 16.12.10 Pours reddy/brown. Fruity with some bitterness. It’s a little tangy, to be honest my rating is at the end of a session so sketchy at best I’m afraid. A6 A3 T6 P3 Ov13 3.1
Mauldons Eatanswill Old;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Mauldons;Cask handpull at Edgar Wallace, London. Deep chestnut colour thin beige head. It’s a decent dark bitter like was made when I was a nipper. Good malts, touch of wood and vague sourness. It’s a dark bitter really.
Mauldons Eatanswill Old;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Mauldons;Cask-conditioned at the Wheatsheaf, Southwark 27/01/10. Dark brown with a hint of red and slight, off-white head.

Mauldons Eatanswill Old;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Old Ale;Mauldons;Cask conditioned handpump Malt Shovel Northampton (The Daventry Pixi Drive). A dark brown coloured beer with an off-white ring of bubbles. Sweet caramel and bready malt in the aroma which all follow through to the mouth where they are joined by a little fruitiness too. A decent beer but lacking flavour and depth compared to most English Old Ales
Du Bout de l'Île L'Insulaire;Sainte-Pétronille, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Cidrerie du Bout de l'Île - Polyculture Plante;"Still cider, 750 ml bottle, brought from the city of Quebec by my friend Rosi. Surprised this wasn't in the db, but considering its mediocre quality, so what? Cloudy golden champagne appearance, nice fruity-sweet nose, but I'm letdown in the flavor department. It's ""light"" all right, almost tasteless at first if you start out very cold as I did. Let it warm to say 45 degrees or better and there's a little sugary apple to it, of the more innocuous type (think gala, or maybe golden delicious); very little finish. Still, fresh and ""real"" unlike a lot of American varieties that you buy in 6-packs."
Du Bout de l'Île L'Ensorcelé;Sainte-Pétronille, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Cidrerie du Bout de l'Île - Polyculture Plante;Bottle (375 ml) bought at the cidery. Clear pale yellow with a small ring of white foam, quickly vanishing, leaving no lacing or legs. Aroma is very soft with floral notes, mild fruitiness that reminds me of green apples (though it’s made with red apples) and hints of white wine. Taste is midly sweet and gently acidic with floral notes, a mix of green and red apples and hints of white wine. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Floral and fruity finish. It has a similar - though lighter - profile than many white wine like ciders producted in Québec but the lower abv and the acidity make it much more palateable, drinkable and quenching. The bottle was empty in a matter of minutes.

Carlyle Holiday Spice;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Carlyle Brewing Company;The body is a clear mahogany color with a modest head that does some spotty lacing. Vanilla dominates the aroma, covering a lightly roasted malt. The flavor is lightly roasted malt, somewhat sweet, with loads of vanilla and a splash of chocolate. Clove and cinnamon emerge as an afterthought very late in the finish. Decent enough. Carlyle Brewing Company, Rockford, IL

Capitol City Belgian Cherry Blonde;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Capitol City Brewing Company;"On tap at Capitol City Brewing Company in D.C. Pours clear medium red with very small off-white head. No lacing, medium body, and low carbonation. Taste is floral malt, cherry, and a hint of hops. Waitress said it was sweet; not that sweet and refreshing."
Capitol City Belgian Cherry Blonde;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Capitol City Brewing Company;Capitol City Tart Cherry Ale/Christmas Cherry on Draft. Pours a pretty pale, generic golden color, head is white but disappears quickly. Aroma of cherry. Flavor is a mild tart cherry, but does not hold my interest for very long. Not bad but I wouldn’t say it’s anything to call home about.
Capitol City Belgian Cherry Blonde;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Capitol City Brewing Company;2007 version, maybe it’s a different beer but it doesn’t matter much. It was called Capitol City Tart Cherry Ale on the menu. Has a light straw color, completely clear. Not red at all, but light straw brown. Nose of candied cherries, some sort of jelly candy, and a flavor of some sort of base biscuity malt, a slight tart cherry candy flavor, with a light bitterness and dryness in the finish. It’s actually not loose on the palate like every other Cap City brew.
Capitol City Belgian Cherry Blonde;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Capitol City Brewing Company;Setting: Served in a pint glass from the tap. Appearance: Hazy reddish peach colored liquid topped by a nice sized thick white head. Dissipates to a film pretty quickly and leaves small blobs of foam on the glass. Aroma: Faint whiffs of cherries and not much else. Some cooked veggie and skunky notes when agitated. Flavor: An initial light caress of sweet cherries followed by a mildly hoppy pale malt taste. Sour woody pits on the aftertaste. Palate: Very crisp and clean. Quite the palate cleanser with it’s tartness. I suspect one of their salads would go great with this. Overall: Just barely an average beer, if that. Not much to like or dislike. There’s not much of a nose and not much character in the taste to interest me. Still, it went down pretty easily.
Capitol City Belgian Cherry Blonde;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Capitol City Brewing Company;A very nice blonde ale. Light cherry flavors added a nice tought. Light and sweet while still having some consistency. Nice
Kemphaan Donker;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;This beer has a dark brown body - hue apperance and a coarse light brown scum collar. I have drunk the beer from the bottle and it had not much carbonic acid. The initial flavor taste is moutig with a sweet/bitter afther tast.
Kemphaan Donker;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;An unclear red beer with a beutiful orange head. The aroma is sweet spicy with dominating notes of yeast and coriander - the aroma is more like that of a blonde than a donker. The flavor is sour with notes of caramel, yeast, and coriander and the body is thin. A weird donker.
Kemphaan Donker;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;This is an extremely boring Dutch brew. Not something to remember or to try again.
Kemphaan Donker;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;The flavour is pretty sourish in this brew. Quite malty finish. Sweet aftertaste and palate.
Kemphaan Donker;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;Reddish brown coloured. Very yeasty aroma. Yeasty and sweet flavour. Very classic Dutch microbrew.
Kemphaan Donker;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;Strong licorice aroma. Hazy, dark brown color, white rocky head that diminishes fast, no lace. Spicy, licorice, little yeasty, light sweet, light bitter, sparkling, watery but still sticky.
Kemphaan Donker;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;Bottle conditioned. `t Arendsnest Jan 2004. Chestnut red, good initial fluffy white head soon dropping to thin but lasting cover and moderate condition. Fruity sweet chocolate malt with a good dubbel yeastiness in the nose. Sweet and fruity, dry and figgy with slight roasted barley, chocolate malt and low hop flavour in the mouth. Long chocolate and yeast in the finish.
Kemphaan Donker;Almere, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij de Kemphaan;Dark brown color, cloudy, chunks of yeast floating. Big creamy head, only fading away slowly. Only slight chocolate and yeastaroma. Also chocolate and yeast in the slightly roasted flavor. OK but unconvincing.
Baltika 12 Novogodneye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);From the archives: This resembled porter. We had this one with traditional garlic bread and pork chops. Remember it as a smooth beer. It was a trial, and there are repetitions of it from year to year.
Baltika 12 Novogodneye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);"First, the good news about this. It survived the long trip back from Russia in my boss’ luggage. The bad news is, I could find nothing about this from the brewers website so I had to get my info from ""the other site"". Sorry, but I was desperate! Now onto the beer! Pours almost ruby red with a small tannish head. The nose is malted and sweet with a very light hop base. Some hints of caramel along with a slight metallic or processed note. The taste seems like weakened malt and caramel notes. Seems a little watered down. The hop character is very light and almost not noticeable. Finishes with some slight tartness and with some malt. Very drinkable in parts but the processed hint comes in and out and detracts from the overall enjoyment of this one. Very drinkable. Probably better on draft. I will take a pic of this and have someone post it but for now I’ll have to describe it: an oval blue label with silver trim. The Cyrillic Baltika in the center in white. Beneath it is a sphere with a red 12 and snow falling on it. Above the Baltika is a clock with Roman numerals and snowflakes falling. The time, almost midnight."
Burton Bridge Rollercoaster;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Bridge Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Beer House, Manchester 06/02/2004 Amber coloured with some alcohol present. Sweet and hoppy with a crisp slightly dry malt finish.
Burton Bridge Rollercoaster;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Bridge Brewery;Copper colour. Quite malty aroma, although a bit murky and greasy. A little harsh. Again malty on the palate with some bitterness coming through late on. All the elements are there, but somehow not particularly well integrated. Quite palatable though. Handpump, Lord Moon of the Mall (JDW), Whitehall, London SW1.
Burton Bridge Rollercoaster;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Bridge Brewery;Cask Fresh @ JDW Turnpike, Welling. An unremarkable bitter.

Bière du Foudre (Lutry) St. Nicolas 2003;Paudex, Switzerland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bière du Foudre;"Huge yellow-amber head, collapsing with very good lace; hazy chocolate-brown beer. Sourish tinge in the nose, very specific arom, reminding me of an Indian sauce - mint/yoghurt/cilandro? Definitely yoghurt. Cheese aperitive biscuits. Very sourish beer, lemony, buttermilk. Faint flavour of flaked milkchocolate. Lactic acid. Adstringent mouthfeel, dry-out. Not thin, seems like oatmeal-filled. I cannot quite believe this was meant to be as such. It’s not at all bad, but just too weird to be believed. Thanks for unique beer, Alex."
Bière du Foudre (Lutry) St. Nicolas 2003;Paudex, Switzerland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bière du Foudre;Dark reddish brown coloured. A very malty brew. Sweet with notes of coffee and chocolate. Thanks Alex.
Bière du Foudre (Lutry) St. Nicolas 2003;Paudex, Switzerland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bière du Foudre;A deep red beer with a small disappearing beige head. The aroma is malty with hints of sourness. The flavor is primarily of roasted malt with a slight sour background. Maybe the not that high marks are due to the fact, that this was sampled bottled in Denmark, brought in by Alex (fiulijn) who had bottled it at the Brasserie. Thanks, Alex, for the hard work.
Bière du Foudre (Lutry) St. Nicolas 2003;Paudex, Switzerland;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bière du Foudre;dark brown colour, few head, aroma of black chocolate and prune, sweet and light-bodied, light bitterness, chocolaty and biscuity finish

Excellent maltiness, sweet, velvety, smooth, with a good balance of roasted malt; delicate coffee. Caramel and nuts finish. Another good try! Bottle; 2004-03-02, 6-3-7-4-13 Unfortunately has lost almost all the carbonation… The aroma is ordinary (malt and caramel), but stronger than the draught one. The taste is of a reasonable stout, not outstanding. The nutty, roasted final is still a good thing."
Leopold Brothers Pale Ale;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Leopold Brothers Brewery;"Slightly hazy orangeish-amber coloured body with a thin white head. Aroma of funky citrus, cardboard, malt and some light sugars. Medium-bodied; Sharp bitter flavour of cardboard & malt and some sugars come through. Aftertaste sharp and unpleasant with cardboard. Overall, not a horrible beer - but pretty bad - definitely not recommended. Thanks Mom for picking this bottle up for me though. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchaseed from Merchant’s in Dearborn, Michigan on 28-May-2005 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia."
Leopold Brothers Pale Ale;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Weak ice tea brown with strong head and pretty hazy. Hop aroma predominates. Flavor is bland yet sour. No real aftertaste, but then there wasn’t any taste to be after. I wondered why I was not familiar with this brewery, but the last two samples tell me why. It may be the bottleing, but I’m not sure I’d risk a trip to the brewery based on these.
Leopold Brothers Pale Ale;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Leopold Brothers Brewery;The combination of diacetyl and the bordering-on-offensive house yeast funk give the impression of buttered toe cheese.
Leopold Brothers Pale Ale;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Leopold Brothers Brewery;i dont really know what to say about this....appearance is its strong suit (orangish brownish golden body)....aroma is of a Hindu princess (wet socks, sugar, butter, cinnamon, dirty laundry, garbage, and very sweat-like)...flavor tastes like the Hindu princess’ clothing...sweat stained, kitchen smelling (bad curry), butter...i bet Shaq’s socks taste like this...i shared a bottle and barely choked it down....it sorta reminds me of what a fat man would smell like after his skin fused to the bed sheets due to his lack of activity....plus the added hints of food from the head-board behind his fat and disgusting garbage disposal of a head....YUCK
Leopold Brothers Pale Ale;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Leopold Brothers Brewery;"On tap at the brewery. First off let me say this. I am shocked that this is rated so low. I definately feel that this should get a second look from some people. Another thing, the waitress/bartender told me that this was a new batch. Apparently they have small/limited equipement and are frequently making new batches. She didnt say that things have been changed but she said that it was ""new batch"" so maybe thats where my rating is comming from. Goldish in color with a thin white head. THe nose is very sweet with hops slight bits of grass. Little bits of metal taste I think from the containers not from the ingredietens. The taste was very pleasant. Not overly hopped but it was definately there. Again, sweet. Overall it was very drinkable and quite good really. I would definately drink this again."
Leopold Brothers Pale Ale;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Bottle. Straw yellow with hardly a head. Aroma is light wheat with some grassiness to it. This liquid is a pure waste of a perfectly good bottle and cap. These Leopold Brothers should be ashamed to sell this stuff. The flavors don’t go together at all. Stragne hop taste and corn juice somehow make the whole concoction somehow sour.
Leopold Brothers Pale Ale;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Bottle: Fruity and light hop aromas. Pours an orangish-gold with a hwite head. Really sour. Light up front with a really sour and Euro-lager finish.
Leopold Brothers Pale Ale;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Leopold Brothers Brewery;"Tap. Decent pale. Light amber in color with a decent white head. Aroma was a little soft but fair with some ""C"" hops. Body was light-medium, smooth mouthfeel. Decent malt and hop balance in taste."
Leopold Brothers Pale Ale;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Leopold Brothers Brewery;okay, first impressions aside. i did not enjoy this beer initially, but since then i have realized that it’s enjoyable for what it is (which is definitely NOT an american pale ale). still very carbonated, but slightly mellowed out and neutral. i have to give this beer another shot. original: way overcarbonated, led to a monstrous off-white head. hazy light amber color. very sour, smells more like a hoppy hefeweizen or a spicy belgian than an APA. cloves, oranges, some english or german-style hops maybe. i really wanted to like this beer because i like the brewery, but i just couldn’t enjoy it. maybe i got some bad bottles... not a good effort. interesting? yes. a good pale ale? no.
Leopold Brothers Pale Ale;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Leopold Brothers Brewery;light grainy aroma, yellowish orange with a long lasting head, a few were overcarbonated, sour and cidery with no hop presence, downright bad
Left Hand Rye Bock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Left Hand Brewing Company;Bottled (backlog). Reddish amber colour with a mediumsized off-white head.

Left Hand Rye Bock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Left Hand Brewing Company;A bit musty smell of sour caramel, brown sugar, toffee and bread. Soft and sweet taste of sweets and bread, no bitterness. Not a beer in my taste!
Left Hand Rye Bock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Left Hand Brewing Company;RBESG Sheffield 2009 Grand Tasting @ the Harlequin. Amber color, sweet malty with spicy notes.Dry finish with low bitterness.
Left Hand Rye Bock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Left Hand Brewing Company;Bottle... Dark, burnt orange lager with a small, creamy, white head. Good retention. Caramel, toffee and grapefruit aroma with hints of light molasses and ginger. The flavor is malty sweet and bready with notes of toffee and caramel. I’m not picking up much of the rye... a shame. Medium-bodied with a dry, almost caustic mouth feel and champagne-like carbonation. Sahara-dry finish. The rye only makes its appearance known in the mouth feel and finish. Rye’s probably my second favorite grain and I would have enjoyed more of it.
Left Hand Rye Bock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Left Hand Brewing Company;Bottle/750ml - Bottled in 2008 and a bit over carbonated, this beer may no longer be in its prime. Loosening the caged cork signaled a near disaster... the cork began to push out as I untwisted the wire cage while I held the top of the cork... QUICK RUN OUTSIDE!! Disaster averted and I did not lose too much beer after all. It poured a very dark , clear amber in color with a medium foamy head that settled to a thin covering over the beer, Aroma is malty and slightly sweet with bready yeastiness. Flavor was nice and malty and mildly sweet with plenty of bready yeasts and a fair amount of dark fruit (dates, prunes, etc.). A bit of the classic spiciness that you expect with rye in the grist. Finish lingers... dark fruits and the sweet malts... One of the better rye beers I have had... a bit sweet for my tastes, but still quite good, actually.
Left Hand Rye Bock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Left Hand Brewing Company;29-Nov-10 (750-ml corked and caged bottle, Bottled in 2008: Purchased 11-Apr-09 for $13.99 at Gold Hill in Fairbanks, AK) Two years of aging seems about right for this beer. It’s a malt-driven beer, medium-sweet, plenty of toffee, caramel, milk chocolate, and bread crust, with backing flavors of dried fruits, a light grassiness and modest spiciness which help to offset the sweetness. Medium-full in body with medium but smooth carbonation and enough dryness to keep the sweetness in check. Less aromatic than flavorful, the nose is earthy, sweet, caramely, and chocolaty. The hazy, ruby-amber beer pours a tall, bubbly, light-tan head that rises to well over an inch before settling ever-so-slowly to a quarter inch and hold there for the duration of the session. Simply stunning head retention, and even the lacing is decent, with large, foamy patches scattered all around the glass. A solid beer and excellent one for aging too, this one excels in every category.
Left Hand Rye Bock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Left Hand Brewing Company;lots of really nice fresh malt character, with a little spicy complexity from the rye.
La Croix Blanche - Rousse;Posieux, Switzerland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;La Bière de Posieux (le Pot des Cieux);Hazy nice aroma of malt (caramel), very low bitterness but well balanced, not too sugary. Taste of rhubarb, caramel and yeast. Nice too drink on a terrasse, tough lacks a bit of complexity for serious testing. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
La Croix Blanche - Rousse;Posieux, Switzerland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;La Bière de Posieux (le Pot des Cieux);33 cl bottle at a café, while hiking near Gyuers. Label says 5 % alcohol. Hazy, amber colour with a thin, white head. Fruity aroma with caramel malts, toasted notes, an odd acidic hint - actually helps cutting trough the rich cheese soup, bread and sweet fruits. Taste is light sweet. Medium body with a creamy texture and a soft carbonation. Finishes slightly dry with caramel malts and a lightly sourish note. Spicy impressions. A bit off-style. Still pleasant.

La Croix Blanche - Rousse;Posieux, Switzerland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;La Bière de Posieux (le Pot des Cieux);From tap at the brewpub. Pours hazy amber with a small off-white and dense head. Nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is roasted malty and light fruity. Fruity flavoured with a light citric and lingering fruity note. Smooth fruity finish - a bit too acidic.
La Croix Blanche - Rousse;Posieux, Switzerland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;La Bière de Posieux (le Pot des Cieux);Bottled@omhper. Reddish amber colour, small beige head. Aroma is fruity hops, sourness, some mild wooden notes. Flavour is acidic fruits, some mild herbal notes. Feels a bit infected.
La Croix Blanche - Rousse;Posieux, Switzerland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;La Bière de Posieux (le Pot des Cieux);Bottled, thanks Bov! Cloudy orange, minimal head. Involuntary lambic from nose to finish. Sour with clean mouthfeel. Just infected, no other flavours matters.

Tuatara X-Ale;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Didn’t really care for this one. Very phenolic yeasty aroma with passionfruity NZ hops. More yeast and phenol flavour again with loads of passionfruit and a late, strong bitterness, which I found to be an odd combination. Funnily enough I also thought this one tasted like it used Wyeast 3522 too so maybe I’m just stupid...
Tuatara X-Ale;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Big Hoppy aroma, yellow in colour with big fluffy head. hopyy taste and was like drink hop pallets directly.
Tuatara X-Ale;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Tropical aroma, quite hoppy. Heaps of kiwi fruit, passionfruit, lychee to start with, with some citrus passiona in the end, lightly spicy. Start is sweet, but bitteres out nicely towards the end. Pretty tasty stuff.
Tuatara X-Ale;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);pretty seriously passiofruity. some sweentess and spiciness but alas a little bit of kero nastiness just crept in towards the end of the glass. otherwise very good
Tuatara X-Ale;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);an enormous whiff of passionfruit yoghurt and crushed ants - weird but appetising. body is nice and malty, chewy with honey and nougat, and finishes really hoppy with more passionfruit and spice. pretty interesting, a saison and an IPA in one.

Dr. Dremos Dremos Strong Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Strong Ale - American;Shenandoah Brewing Company;A good strong ale. The beer with a similar name that is currently offered at Dr. Dremo's tap house in Arlington is not nearly as good. This one was very good example of a strong ale. Tons of hops tons of malt. Borderline barley wine. I miss it so.
Dr. Dremos Dremos Strong Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Strong Ale - American;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Massive is right! Everything about this beer is huge. I only had it once a few years ago on draught when the brewery and pub were in Arlington, VA but I have never forgotten it.

Dr. Dremos Dremos Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Shenandoah Brewing Company;"Super hazy muddy amber/orange/brown coloured body that looks like apple cider more than anything else. Aroma of fresh hops, yeast and a bunch of sugars, even though this bottle is about 2 years old. Light to Medium-bodied; Sharp hop flavour, high in alpha acids with a pungent yeastiness and some sweetness, all with a good malt backbone. The hops hit first and hard, then fade off. Aftertaste shows a lot of yeast and unfinished wort, rather than a full-fleged beer. Overall, a decent beer, especially for being over two years old. I bought this twelve ounce bottle at Shenendoah Brewery in Alexandria, Virginia a long while ago and sampled it on 19-February-2005 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia."
Dr. Dremos Dremos Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Not one of Bardo's better brews. Bardo did American style beers much better than the European styles and this beer atested to that fact. The commerical blurb above compares it to Bass and I would have to agree with that. The big difference being that the water does not taste as if it was hard enough to keep up with that of the Burton-on-Trent water used in Bass.
Dr. Dremos Smoked Porter;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Porter - Smoked;Shenandoah Brewing Company;(bottle at Shenandoah) Red-black body with small off-white head that leaves no lacing.

Dr. Dremos Smoked Porter;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Porter - Smoked;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Another think dark porter. I lost the subulties from the previous strong ale. Still a good porter. I'll have to try it again next time i need to get my butt kicked at pool.
Dr. Dremos Oatmeal Stout;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Sampled at the Newtown Brewfest with Mad_Indian. Pours dark with a light beige head. Aroma of roast and chocolate. The flavor is sweet, chocolate, roast, and nuts.
Dr. Dremos Oatmeal Stout;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Sampled at the Newtown Brewfest 07 with Stegosaurus. Sampled at Shenandoah tent. Dark brown pour with roasted coffee aroma. Roasted finish that just wasn’t wowing me. It was ok.

Aroma is mild, medium sweet, caramel, some roasty, light chocolate. Taste is medium sweet, molasses, caramel, roasty, chocolate, some nutty. Creamy, medium body, some stickiness. Seems more like a porter than a stout.
Dr. Dremos Oatmeal Stout;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Shenandoah Brewing Company;"Dark brown coloured body, almost opaque with a decently dense lighter brown head. Aroma of nuts, roasted malt, caramel and a slight coffee twang. Medium-bodied; Bitter flavour of coffee, nuts & malt up front fading to sweetness after a few seconds. Aftertaste shows some roasted malt and bitterness however. Overall, not as long-lived as I would have liked-but a good attempt at a harder style to make! I sampled this pint on draugt at Dr. Dremo’s in Clarendon/Court House (Arlington), Virginia on 05-August-2004."
Dr. Dremos Oatmeal Stout;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Shenandoah Brewing Company;A suprise find from the taphouse. It was a very sweety stout with only a few touches of malt. Probably too sweet and light for my tastes, but an average stout, and that's better then most.
Raccoon Lodge Barrel Aged Baltic Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter - Baltic;Cascade Brewing;Bomber. Poured deep brown with a tall, dense cap of khaki head.. set up perfectly in the glass. The aroma opened with fresh, sour oak and vinous notes from the barrel treatment with coffee, baker’s chocolate, and burnt molasses not far behind.. I loved the sweet roasty notes that surrounded.. just a little too much barrel influence, but it was still quite good. The flavor opened with sour oak, metallic notes, and unidentifiable bitterness.. chocolate and molasses at the core with more metallic notes surrounding.. finished with vinous notes, molasses, and coffee bitterness. Medium-bodied and sour throughout from the barrel on the palate.. surprisingly weak across the middle.. balance was OK, but the porter part of it needed more heft.
Raccoon Lodge Barrel Aged Baltic Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter - Baltic;Cascade Brewing;22oz bottle acquired in trade with riversideAK (thanks!). Poured a deeper brown color with a large sized off white head. Aromas of some lighter woodiness, chocolate, nutty, and some dark fruits. Tastes of dark fruits, black cherries, oaky woodiness, and I’m getting some of the wine. Had a tart finish that I really liked. I’m surprised by the lower ratings.
Raccoon Lodge Barrel Aged Baltic Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter - Baltic;Cascade Brewing;bomber from riversideAK... pours ruby brown... actually, regular ol’ porter color with a soft tan head and moderate drippy lacing. the nose definitely has a sour barrel note... chocolate, a touch of smoke, roasty grain, fruit and vanilla marshmallows. the taste is... well... unique, interesting and weird but i am not sure that i am a fan. the barrel has not done good things to this. even knowing ahead of time of the lactic sourness it is still hard to swallow. there are some good characters... medium body, prickly carbonation, easy drinking, cocoa, ashy/charred roast, malt powder and red wine. but, for the most part there is a dominating unpleasant floral quality and very odd lactic sourness which actually hurts my stomach after a bit. i really wanted to like the concept...6/3/4/3/10/2.6
Raccoon Lodge Barrel Aged Baltic Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter - Baltic;Cascade Brewing;Bottle via Ron @ The Brewery. Pours black with a tan head. Nose is malty and sweet. Taste is oddly sour, which I don’t mind, with a big malt back end.
Raccoon Lodge Barrel Aged Baltic Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter - Baltic;Cascade Brewing;Thanks Beastiefan2k. Poured a very dark brown color with a tan head. Light sweet malt aroma with hints of spice and some alcohol. Sweet malt flavor with a tartness and taste of cola. Lively carbonation in the mouth. Medium bodied.
Raccoon Lodge Barrel Aged Baltic Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter - Baltic;Cascade Brewing;22oz bottle from tom..... pours a dark cola brown with reddish brown edges and a thin milky light beige head... lots of wood, sour oak, chocolate, and cherries in the aroma....flavors were sour, tart oak that dominate the porter qualities and do not seem to harmonize with each other. the oak overruns everything and compromises the cohesiveness of the brew. prickly, live carbonation but overall, not to my liking.
Raccoon Lodge Barrel Aged Baltic Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter - Baltic;Cascade Brewing;bottle. Oak aging didnt work here. It adds a weird sourness. Some odd flavors and some off flavors in this one.
Raccoon Lodge Barrel Aged Baltic Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter - Baltic;Cascade Brewing;Bomber. Pours a really dark and translucent chestnut brown color with crimson edges. A frothy, bubbly, beige colored head settles to a wispy film. Scattered micro-spots and thin lines of lacing mark the glass. Aromas include dried sour cherries, raisins, figs, oaky vanilla, and earthy hops. Hints of cocoa sweetness are there as well. Flavors are tart, almost sour, with ascorbic cherries showing strong. Cocoa powder and dry, yeasty notes are accompanied by an almost chemical, woody overtone. Moderate in both body and carbonation, the palate is dry and yeasty. This brew is odd and sub-par for the style. Its almost like they used the freshly emptied sour Kriek barrels to age a thinned-out Baltic impersonator.
Raccoon Lodge Barrel Aged Baltic Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter - Baltic;Cascade Brewing;Thanks to Beerlando! Pours almost a dark purple color. The smell is full of pine with a little sour fruitiness. Taste is extremely woody with a little tartness and a good amount of hops. A little off balance with the strong wood flavor and odd hoppiness. Not terrible, but I was not really impressed.
Raccoon Lodge Barrel Aged Baltic Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter - Baltic;Cascade Brewing;Draft at Raccoon Lodge. Pours a dark brown almost black color with a small off-white head.

Roasted malty chocolate finish with lots of woody flavors in the aftertaste.

Stadsbierbrouwerij Apeldoorn Apeldoorns Bockbier;Apeldoorn, Netherlands;Bock - Doppelbock;Stadsbrouwerij Apeldoorn;Bottle from Bierkoning, many thanks! Darkish brown with a small head. Aroma is full of caramel, toasted malts, slightly vinous, dusty basment aromas, dried fruit (raisins, maybe also dates) and licorice. After it gains on temperature overripe fruit become apparent. In some way this smell reminds me of sweets-stands on Christmas fairs. Taste is sweet but not overly so, with a light bitter finish. Flavour is caramelly and fruity. I was expecting something more intense, I don’t see any depth here but - as the alcohol is well hidden - it has the drinkability many other bocks with such a high ABV don’t have. All in all, this is ok but really nothing special.

Old Swan Brewery Wheat Beer;Perth, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Old Brewery (Australia);So, my last rating slagged an American wheat beer style. What do we have here then? The description says it is a Belgian wit and so I then set my expectations accordingly. I want cloudiness, esters of banana, clove orange or coriander and a pleasant smack of slight citric sourness. What I get is possibly what could be described as an Aussie wheat. Given our predisposition to take the piss this could be described as a faaarkwit, or at least a halfwit. The latter a apt as it attempts to emulate the style but there is just not the will to go any more than about 4 of the whole 9 yards. There is the pleasing appearance true to style with bleach blonde head. The nose is lightly hinting of coriander and some citrus but not too much. OK, cradle the beer as it is served at temperatures Kelvin would approve of. Warming, warming, nah stop. No value as there is not a lot there. Flavour is ditto I am afraid as the overriding profile is of sherbet cones not the hop variety. Flat and dull too. This place is a bit like the Monty Python cheese shop sketch. Lots of promise but in the end ot a great deal of delivery. Great place in both position and presentation but it is really for the tourists who want to wax lyrical over the food and Swan river with little regard to the beer. Most punters were drinking WA wine or drinks that owe ther existence to a big stick, fruit and lots of expensive spirits (that’s likker to yawl up north of the equator).
Old Swan Brewery Wheat Beer;Perth, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Old Brewery (Australia);Had high hopes for this one after tasting their ’deadly’ sessionable pilsner. Witbiers aren’t my thing and this one wasn’t exactly the highlight of the night, to say the least. Poured a hazy yellow straw with a lasting, creamy white head. Very little aroma at all that I could sense, bar a little lemon. Quite pasty, dry and overall watery in the mouth, prickly carbonation moved it across the tongue with ease leaving only hints of lemons, eggs?, and grainy wheat, before a short, clean finish. Nothing really disagreeable, it was just one-dimensional and boring to drink. Moved quickly onto their darker beers.
Old Swan Brewery Wheat Beer;Perth, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Old Brewery (Australia);"This was a great afternoon. The Old Swan Brewery has a brewery, a museum, a pub/cafe, and a fine dining restaurant all on premises. In the pub part you can do a ""tasting session"" where they bring you 5 brews on a cricket paddle for about $10. The wheat beer was my least favourite. It had a hazy lemonade appearance, but failed to deliver any standout qualities that make a wheat beer enjoyable. Quite thin and dull (but maybe its because I tackled the dark beers first-- I couldn’t help myself)"
Old Swan Brewery Wheat Beer;Perth, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Old Brewery (Australia);Not a bad wheat beer but slightly hoppy for my liking (though I love IPA). Nice looking beer with citric aroma.
Old Swan Brewery Wheat Beer;Perth, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Old Brewery (Australia);Cloudy yellowish colouring with a long lasting white head. Hints of floral, citric, vanilla and possibly clove aromas. Bitter, citric, and fruity flavours were evident, although taste was not overpowering or strong enough for me. Bit disappointed with this one.
Old Swan Brewery Wheat Beer;Perth, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Old Brewery (Australia);Poured slightly cloudy yellow with a long lasted white head. Good lacing too, first good looking beer I've had from OSB. Mild citric and spice (clove, vanilla) aromas. Smooth soft mouthfeel. Taste was .. interesting. It tasted way too hoppy for me, both too bitter and I detected flavour hops. Nice grainy flavours to back it up though. Still a refreshing wheat beer, I just think they would of been better toning down the hops.
Old Swan Brewery Wheat Beer;Perth, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Old Brewery (Australia);Yellow grapefruit slightly hazy colour with a short head that didn't last too long. No strong aromas but faint whiff of lemon and vanilla. Soft chalky texture with a slight taste of bananas and cloves and a thin finish.Quite refreshing but not a full flavoured beer
Five Islands Porter Kembla;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Porter;Illawarra Brewing Company;On tap at brewery. More of a burnt character than a smokey one I’d say. Notes of sticky cola and coffee. Not too bad, but i think i’ve been spoilt by too many good porters before this one.
Five Islands Porter Kembla;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Porter;Illawarra Brewing Company;Tried as a sampler at the brewery. Fairly good looking, chocolately nose, touch of smoke in the taste, but covered, shows plenty of promise but seems to fall away, but then it got better as it warmed, didn’t notice the smoke the second time around.
Five Islands Porter Kembla;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Porter;Illawarra Brewing Company;mm this is the black beer to have if you visit the brew pub. thick toffee dark roasty notes in flavour, not much in aroma. thick and sticky on the palate it is not sweet though. couldnt specifically taste rauschmalt but there is a certian complexity to this beer. much better than the bulli black in my opinion..
Five Islands Porter Kembla;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Porter;Illawarra Brewing Company;pretty black. instant coffee aroma. tastes of pineapple frosty fruits and nutella. better than that sounds
Five Islands Porter Kembla;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Porter;Illawarra Brewing Company;Probably my favourite of Five Islands beers but that is REALLY not saying much. Pisses me off that they specifically advertise the use of rauchmalz only to not be able to tell in the finished product. Aroma is grainy chocolate malt, some roastiness and a bit of yeast. Flavour is lacking the pale malt character with too much dark malt - don't breweries know to build colour from the bottom up?? Solidly bitter finish which is good. Opaque black colour with tan head - looks like a stout with great head.
Five Islands Gerringong Ginger Beer;North Wollongong, NSW, Australia;Flavored - Other;Illawarra Brewing Company;sweet ginger aroma. starts with some compost tang, then has some sharp ginger and a finish of white sugar. but not too bad for sitting out by the beach at the brewpub

Nose is slightly smoky with a roasted quality about it. Goes down smooth with subtle, but strong coffee and roasted qualities. Thick malt flavors. I also get what I think is a blue cheese flavor in a way. Odd, yeah? Feel is superb IMO. Excellent level of carbonation combined with the ingredients. I am hoping I didn’t just catch this on a good day and that it is like this all of the time. A great porter and one I would continually go back to if I were to frequent this spot

Blue Corn (Santa Fe) High Altitude Pale Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Corn Brewery (Santa Fe);"Found my tasting notes from our Sept. 2000 Rt. 66 trip, at the suburban location. This is before I discovered beer rating sites, but I still wanted to note some impressions. I had the most notes on this one among the samplers I tried. ""Coppery, despite lower IBUs; drier and crisper than the IPA. Okay, not enough for BJCP certification, but I wanted to give props for a place that I thought had good beer AND good food.

Blue Corn (Santa Fe) High Altitude Pale Ale;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Corn Brewery (Santa Fe);"On tap at the brewpub, notes taken on a napkin. This beer was decidedly ""not bad,"" but in no way did it impress me. With absolutely no head whatsoever, its color further bored me by resembling blood-tinged urine. The nose was modestly interesting, with strong citrus tones balancing out the sour/bitterness. The opening flavors were modestly fruity, with a stronger citrus character emerging in the middle. Aftertaste was pleasantly strong, with bitter hops fading gently on the back of the tongue. While the basic flavors in this beer are uninspiringly pleasant, drinking it unfortunately reminded me of sipping Sunny Delight spiked with cheap vodka. Also noteworthy; I saw very little carbonation in this beer, so I’m not sure how a little more fizz would have excited this otherwise dull drink."

I don’t personally find it bitter, however I do find it a very rewarding and invigorating brew. Would recommend."

Aberdeen Oatmeal Stout;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Stout;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Mouthfeel is way too thin. An oatmeal stout is supposed to be somewhat lush, but this is real thin. The small amount of cofee-chocolate-roastiness in this one seems artificial. Not very well balanced with hops either. There is also a strange pervasive sour yeastiness. I do actually enjoy this place, and I hope he can pull things together a little in the sophistication and complexity department.
Aberdeen Oatmeal Stout;Valparaiso, Indiana, United States;Stout;Aberdeen Brewing Co.;Brown hue with a creamy small tan head and some lace.

The finish is lightly coffee bitter and nutty. The mouthfeel is thin but still creamy feeling. A solid offering from Aberdeen and a stout worth drinking again.

It pours a clear reddish gold with a huge billowy head of foam. The smell is of...whoah..fruity and citrusy and earthy malty..very nice! The taste has big grapefruit flavour up front but then I can taste the rye and some earthy malt and other fruit, maybe orange, it all comes across as *very* tasty. Wow. I'm big time digging the flavours here. Mouthfeel is medium and very smooth, the carbonation is medium, and it finishes with a nice snap of citrus and rye. Drinkability, despite the abv, is very good. This is another Founders brew that I'd like to revisit. No doubt about it! I love how the rye is so noticeable here as it makes this brew so crisp and easy drinking..Btw, the second pour gets a bit cloudy and overall, the head retention is *awesome* as is the lacing. Bottom line: This is an *awesome* brew! It is probably the best of the style that I have ever tasted!

Redstone Burgundy Mountain Honey Wine;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Mead;Redstone Meadery;2002 production. No head (still). Body is medium reddish purple. Aroma is notes of red wine (cherry, red currant, grape, oak), honey, anise, and light notes of balsamic vinegar, green olive, alcohol. Flavor is heavily sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is moderately sweet, moderately acidic. Medium body, lightly syrupy, flat carbonation. Ok, this is my first serious mead review. I've had some previously in life, but not much. I've also been half-ass reviewing red wines in the last six months, so I figured it was a good time to give mead a try, and Boulder has a reportedly decent meadery (judging from 2003 International Mead Festival results). And well, I like this one. I know just enough of wines to realize this isn't as complex or refined as it perhaps could be, but it's no slouch either. My girlfriend pointed out the olive note, which I don't eat often, but fully agreed with. Nice balance...was worried it would be too sweet, but there's enough tartness (with no astringency, yay!) to keep you sipping into oblivion.

Redstone Plum Mountain Honey Wine;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Mead;Redstone Meadery;Redstone’s newest mead as of my tasting. Aroma full of honey. Flavor is mainly a light to medium bodied honey with delicate plum detectable after searching. Overall this finishes with too heavy of a sweetness. It could really use the balance of oak aging or addition of spice to counter the sweetness.

Nose is lots of tart grapes and light honey. Flavor is similar- tart vinous quality with a dry finish akin to pinot noir.

Vele malen beter aroma dan de bekende fruitbieren. Mooie donkere kleur met een zweem van paars en een opvallend licht gekleurd schuim waarin ook dat paarse iets terug komt. En dan het aroma: heerlijk vol met tonen van bessen, hout, leer en mout. Zonder de typisch stalgeur doet het me denken aan Orval. Ook zo intens! En in de smaak komt dezelfde beleving terug. Mooi stevig bitter (door het dryhoppen?) maar ook fruitig door de bessen. Een echte biersmaak die beter is geworden door de toevoegingen. Klasse!

Feral Strawberry Porter;Baskerville, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Tasted on draught at the brewery/restaurant. In the glass the beer was darker than the normal brown porters, cola coloured with a tinge of red in the light. Head formed and died back to short beige lather. Aroma was of burnt wood and grain, with a light and zesty sweetness, strawberries???. Taste was of a good Porter-style with the burnt black malt, roasted coffee, and a creamy chocolate sweetness. No real strawberry taste, more of an aroma in the nose. Possibly would be a greater beer with the omission of the strawberries from final fermentation. Still a decent example of modern porter.

Stewart's Winterfest Rye Ale;Bear, Delaware, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Stewart's Brewing Company;Draft. Pours deep brown with some haze to it and fluffy off-white to khaki head. Aroma is heavy caramel and scotch malty, with some notes of brown sugar, nuts, and X-mas spice. The mouthfeel is pretty full, with a very malty base giving way to some brown sugary and nutty flavor, plus mild finishing spice and hops. Notably complex, this one was very enjoyable.
Stewart's Winterfest Rye Ale;Bear, Delaware, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Stewart's Brewing Company;THOUGHTS: Sweet. Some chocolate and coffee notes in flavor and aroma. The flavor was pleasant but not strong enough. I think this beer was served a little too cold because on my last too sips when the beer was warmer a some vanilla became quite apparent in the flavor. There was also a little bit of a metallic aftertaste, but a nice beer overall. TECHNICAL: On tap at Stewart’s. The beer was a dark reddish brown with an average-sized, off-white head that diminished quickly. It had a medium body with fizzy carbonation and a metallic finish.

Rock Bottom Bellevue Liquid Sunshine;Bellevue, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Bellevue;Clear pale yellow color with a fleeting head. Grainy malt, lager yeast aromas. Thin flavor is mild lagered corn flake malts.
Rock Bottom Bellevue Liquid Sunshine;Bellevue, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Bellevue;Nice crisp pils aroma. This is okay. Not very dry, a hint of butter. Actually not all that refreshing.
Rock Bottom Bellevue Liquid Sunshine;Bellevue, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Bellevue;I have been on a little bit of a pilsner fix lately so this seemed to fit the bill. That being said, this was extremely uninspired with almost nothing going on. Some flat bready notes in the nose, and that was it. Nose was almost devoid of anything IMO. Pours golden with no head. SOft bready sweetness followed by a crisp finish. Pretty watery, very watery actually. I just didn’t get much flavor or inspiration with this at all. I wanted to like it but could not.
Rock Bottom Bellevue Liquid Sunshine;Bellevue, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Bellevue;Head was flat, colour was clear. There was a malty taste to this one. good amount of carbonation and light bodied.
Rock Bottom Bellevue Liquid Sunshine;Bellevue, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Bellevue;Pours a very clear and brilliant straw color with a thin white head. The aroma is virtually nil - some yeast and some malts. The flavor is a bit malty for a Pilsner, but not as bland as I was expecting. It had a decent sweet malt presence throughout with a touch of noble hops (didn’t taste like Saaz) in the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thick for how light the beer is, but overall is creamy and not unacceptable. Overall, not terrible, but far from their tastiest offering.
Rock Bottom Bellevue Liquid Sunshine;Bellevue, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Bellevue;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear bright gold with a fading white head. Aroma of herbal hops. Light, watery body with medium carbonation. Taste of nuts and lightly sweet caramel. Lightly crisp and flowery hop finish.
Rock Bottom Bellevue Liquid Sunshine;Bellevue, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Bellevue;Draft at the brewpub. Pours fizzy yellow disappointment. At first this seemed to have the familiar failing of a pilsner aroma--that aluminum-y smell. After driving partway home behind an old Vanagon that was chuffing blue smoke on every throttle tap and downshift, though, it’s clear: this beer smells like it needs a ringjob. It smells like an overly rich mix of gas fumes. Well, ok, not literally that harsh or pungent, but a much lighter version of that chemical sweetness. Almost no flavor at all, and the body is as close to water as I’ve had in a draft beer. I really hate knocking a talented brewer so thoroughly, but tonight’s sampler platter just never came together.
Rock Bottom Bellevue Liquid Sunshine;Bellevue, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Bellevue;Seemed out of stile for a pilsner... overly sweet and not crisp... I was disappointed in this beer
Johansson's Holy Water Belgian Strong Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Johansson's Dining House;Light haziness to the bright gold body, sitting underneath a 1/2 inch sticky white head. Nose is heavy candy sugar, some candied pineapple and pear, some alcohol and some lighter yeast esters. Flavor is much the same - very sweet, too sticky, but just below what I could call cloying. Has the standard light perfumy spices and a faint bit of yeast, finishing with a light dryness and a small hint of alcohol. Reminds me of Unibroue but more sweet and with less body.
Johansson's Holy Water Belgian Strong Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Johansson's Dining House;I was pleasantly surprised by this creamy straw-colored ale. From the name, I was expecting something taken to extremes, but this was indeed a pleasantly balanced Belgian Strong Ale. The alcohol is well hiddened by a lovely balance of barley and hops. The hops are more flavorful and strong that one expects, but match the hoppiness well. Goes down easy and smooth.
Rock Bottom South Denver Willow Creek Pale Ale;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom South Denver;Part of sampler at brewpub. Pours golden oragne with white head.

Rock Bottom South Denver Willow Creek Pale Ale;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom South Denver;The Rock Bottom set of reviews is a reflection of my hasty attempt to drink a small quantity of many beers and produce accurate and helpful reviews. Clearly I’ve failed, but I hope my incoherent and cryptic critiques can help at least a few folks who wander in and want to know what to order. A previous lesson with pale ales taught me that the variety within this hopsy branch of beers is slimmer than others. I was led to believe that mistakes were harder to make, and a brewer’s margin of error would be more lenient. Rock Bottom’s Willow Creek Pale Ale ripped that naïve belief right out of my skull. A good pale ale is bitter, sure, but wreathed in a well orchestrated mix of other good flavors. Apparently, the brewer forgot about those entirely when mixing up the Willow Creek Pale Ale. Never did I think someone would have the audacity to make me pay for a glass (although small) of liquid sloth and flavor avarice. Clearly there was no effort put into elevating this offensive pale ale past the taste of tugboat fuel. At least I know what to do with it in a pinch if anyone sees to afflict me with it as a gift. What’s worse is the Willow Creek’s effective disguise. Neither the semi-cloudy, relaxed good appearance nor the innocuous smell give any warning to a would-be drinker. By all means, this beer deserves to be called fiendish and nothing else.

Rock Bottom South Denver Devils Back Stout;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom South Denver;Review: The Rock Bottom set of reviews is a reflection of my hasty attempt to drink a small quantity of many beers and produce accurate and helpful reviews. Clearly I’ve failed, but I hope my incoherent and cryptic critiques can help at least a few folks who wander in and want to know what to order. My first encounter with the distinctly European devil slithering around the ceiling of Rock Bottom was when I was underage and, to be candid, apathetic. Beer tasted all the same to me. How little I knew, and how wonderful it was to finally kick back a shot glass of the stout post-21 on a second visit to the restaurant. The necrotic black liquid keeps a burning coal brown-red wreath of foam around the top, and emanates columns of smoky chocolate. The taste is absolutely seductive, packed with a creamy dynamic set of chocolate and malts flavors. It begins innocently enough, bland and mellow, but rages suddenly into a combustion of almost overwhelming deep, bitter chocolate flavor. Screw the forbidden apples, I’ll take this any day.

Aromas are grainy malts, cereal, a touch of honey sweetness mixed with a light hopping on the nose. Small, but nice.

Thin bodied, lightly hopped, not a bad summer beer and not bad fresh. However, it’s just another craft Blonde/Kolsch beer. Not bad.

Samuel Adams Hefeweizen;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boston Beer Company;Such a smart beer. This American version somehow captures several german style weiss beer nuances with a cleaned up bubblegum twist

Aroma is typical of a Hefeweizen, cloves and spices. Tastes strongly of bananas. Overwhelmingly actually. Palate is more complex than I would have guessed, cloves and nutmeg compliment the banana. Not a bad beer but the too-strong banana taste undercuts the upsides of this beer.

Light clove some banana and lots of bready maltiness with faint earthy spicy hops. Drinkable but too mainstream to be considered a German Hefe.
Samuel Adams Hefeweizen;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Boston Beer Company;This is NOT a Hefeweizen. Samuel Adams brews some great beer but this is not one of them.

Mickey Finns Wee Heavy Scottish Ale;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Growler via a JPDIPSO associate. Translucent and light chestnut in color with a potato grease cover, and cascading, beady lace. Smoked peat and whetted cardboard come to mind at first sniff, and then I start thinking about ignited hardwood floor hidden under 1970s shag carpeting. Smoked cocoa beans and wood chipped hazelnuts enter through the aromatic backdoor. Smoky inclinations defiantly ring out with rubbery smoked peanuts. Subtle carbonation alloys with wood-fired white rye loafs. Smoked cocoa branches meet manila folders that have had burnt cocoa grinds scattered inside them for some time. Decently full-bodied and a generally well-balanced treatise. Smoke-kissed chestnut shells and earthen twigs compliment the crispy, dry recession. Well done.
Mickey Finns Wee Heavy Scottish Ale;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Growler ala a roommate from the past. Thanks Dan. Copper to light umber color with a smaller lid of creamy looking ecru bubbles. Initial heavy smoke nose replaced by a mild dark caramel and light peat scent. Lots of caramel and and a pale malt flavors. Perhaps not a rich and thick as I would prefer, but still quite adequate. Some light fruit in the middle leading to a full lasting smoke filled sausage kitchen. This is a decent smoked brew.

Mickey Finns Wee Heavy Scottish Ale;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Cask conditioned version available at Mickey Finn’s, Libertyville, IL. Clear amber ale having no discernable head. No discernable aroma and carbonation. Full bodied that starts with slighty sweet malt flavor with notable white grape juice and caramel hints. Sharp peppery alcohol flavor. Finishes with light bitterness and slight cloying sweetness. Definite alcoholic warmth. Inappropriately served in a rather large 20 oz goblet, considering the high alcohol content. Although this is a good drinkable beer, the flavors needed more melding together (more aging needed?) as it tasted like white grape juice drink spiked with ethanol. (original 3.2 rating). UPDATE: I had this ale again at Mickey Finn’s brewpub but this time I thought the second batch had a much better flavor. Clear brown ale having a small diminishing head. No discernable carbonation. Nice spicy fruity aroma. Full bodied with oily texture that starts with light sweet malt, spice, and caramel flavors. Finishes dry with lingering light bitterness. Delicious and well-balanced. Definite alcoholic warmth. Compared to the earlier batch that I sampled, this recent batch was much superior in that of the earlier batch. That is, the flavors were melded smoothly together and the beer was more dangerously drinkable. My ratings have been modified to reflect the average of both batches.

Ominously hazed orange-amber with a fine white collar; on closer inspection, swirling with detritus. Spoons, bless ’em. Whiffs half-heartedly of aniseed. Not bad considering; soggy digestive malts, plastic yeastiness, bitter orange, again a strong aniseed/fennel seed note. Bitter, soapy linger. But you can’t serve a beer in this condition without it tasting slightly of sick. Serviceable bitter- could force a whole half down if pushed."

This one was actually a $2 taster which really was a neccessity a the 9%IIPA beckoned. Crystal malt flavour and a slight toffee but I didn’t really pick up the 42IBU bit. OK, this might be high for some but it really isn’t that bitter. A good ber that could do with some re-evaluation in the future.

Earl Soham Sir Rogers Porter;Debenham, Suffolk, England;Porter;Earl Soham Brewery;Cask at the Grain & Hop Store, Cambridge. Ruby/dark brown, very translucent with a small to medium tan head. Some roasty notes, chocolate, nutty aroma. Slight astringency. Taste is bittersweet initially, then quite sweet with a sulphurous note. More chocolate and some coffee in the long finish along with some acrid notes. Lively natural carbonation on the mouth. Not the best porter in the world.

Hops Winter Amber Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);This amber is certainly a lot better than their regular beer. amber. Its drinkable for one. Some caramel and a little touch of light hops. Some astringency in finish but bearable overall. Tap at Alexandria brewpub.
Hops Winter Amber Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Draft flight 1/22/09 (Tampa)-Pours a clear copperish amber with a decent head. Aroma of caramel, malt, and slight spruce. Taste of the same with no spruce. This medium bodied brew was not bad.
Hops Winter Amber Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);On tap at the Alexandria, Virginia location. Pours a moderately-dark brownish-amber color with a short tan head that does not stick around for very long and leaves no lacing behind. The nose brings forward some stale amber malt as well as a bit of over-toasted malt. Behind that, a bit of a metallic astringency comes through. The taste is more of the same. There’s a prominent metallic character underneath highly-toasted malt. Dry dry and quite bitter with a bit of a grain-husk character. Finish is really harsh and metallic. Not a good beer. I would not have this again. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 12-20-2010

Hops Winter Amber Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);From the tap at Ft Meyers. Medium copper body with a little offwhite lacing head. Aroma was a thin malt, floral. Flavor was a bit floral, pine hop. Medium palate.
Hops Winter Amber Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Draft at Ft. Myers, FL location. Light tan small head that became mostly diminishing, fair lacing, no visible carbonation, transparent, and a reddish brown hue. Aroma was malty, caramel, roasty, and some chocolate notes. Flavor was malty, hops, some chocolate, and roasty. Tingly mouthfeel.
Hops Winter Amber Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);On draught: Clear medium amber with a small, fleeting off-white head. The aroma is barely there with some sweet caramel and grains. Taste is light caramel, a hint of diacetyl (well within limits), and maybe just a bit of grains. I normally include many descriptors in my ratings, but there’s just nothing more to write about this one. Light bodied, watery, moderate-medium carbonation.
Hops Winter Amber Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);"On tap: The last of their offerings and it leads me to question how you call yourself ""Hops"" and not really use to much or even offer an IPA or APA. Very light aroma of sugary caramel and toffee. Dark transparent amber with an off-white head. Sweet buttery caramel flavor up front with a lightly bitter finish. Somewhat similar to the Thoroughbread Red, but sweeter and a little more flavor."
Hops Winter Amber Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);This draft brew from the brewery in Fort Myers Florida poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized of light brown colored bubbles that left behind a good lacing. The body contained soft carbonation, was transparent and dark ruby red brown in color. Its aroma contained notes of roasted malts and was very mild. Its mouth feel is initially slightly tingly with a lingering slightly tingly palate and a mild biting aftertaste. Its flavor contained mild amber raisin dark beer brown malts notes and was tasty.
Hops Winter Amber Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);On tap at Manchester, CT location. Fruity, vinous chocolate-like aroma. I almost detect blueberries? A bit of roastiness is also present in the nose that is complemented by some sugariness. Transparent garnet-mahogany color with a tan head. Start is caramelly with mild berry-like astringency, turning more roasted and a bit chocolatey. Somewhat chewy towards the end. This almost tastes like an Old Ale without the added alcohol. Palate and mouthfeel is just off...
Fitgers Haydukes Wheat;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;Majorly clouded dark goldish yellow color with a thin white head, a bubbled puffed ring stays around the edge, spotty amoeba lacing sticks well. Aroma is quite yeasty with good amounts of clove, some banana esters, and a light backing of sweet wheat. Taste follows the smell with a nice easy banana front, cloves and yeast come in quickly thereafter and burst over the palate. Maybe a bit to much though, and over kinda quick, its not in an overbearing way, still mild but in what seems to be a high amount of spiced grab where the clove lingers for a good time with light sweetness peeping through the finish with some yeastyness and light airy dryness. Feel is light to medium bodied with a nice airy frothness and carbonation. A smooth drinker, goes down well enough, but could have used a bit more subtleness and lasting flavors, other then that, a pretty good white.
Fitgers Skyline Imperial Pale Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fitgers Brewhouse;A nice beer to finish a meal with. It is strong in flavor as well as alcohol. Plenty of hop to hold it together.
Fitgers Skyline Imperial Pale Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fitgers Brewhouse;Pours a very hazy amber gold, with about an inch and a half of soft white suds. The head dies down in short order to a thin ring around the edge of the glass. As I happily drain the glass, I enjoy a whole lotta lacing. Good bitter hoppy aroma. Even though the hops predominates, I will start with the malt. Nice and sweet, some caramel, light brown sugar, fig, and a subtle wild rice presence. I also found that wild rice flavor in Fitgers’ Misty Mountain IPA - a bit less in Skyline than in Misty Mountain. I don’t know what ingredient or combination of ingredients causes that, but whatever it is, I love it. Bring it on! OK, now the hops. Strong piney/citrus hops up front, with spicy/floral hops coming up behind. Finishes with a blend of all the above, quite bitter and absolutely delicious. Softly carbonated, very smooth drinking. Full bodied, especially in the aftertaste where the malt clings to your tongue for a second, only to be attacked and dissolved by that wonderful hop bitterness and some hot alcohol. The hop flavor lingers. The alcohol heads straight to the brain.
Fitgers Skyline Imperial Pale Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fitgers Brewhouse;Cask. Pours a hazed ruby orange with some ambe tinge. A gelatinous cask head of quivering lemon merangue tops. Candy-like resin and floral aroma, light oranges and tangy lime juics. Flavor is a gentle oakiness, blended with some reserved mellow outward hoppiness and a good kick of diacetyl butterscotch. Some quiet creaminess and a hint of raw grain. Palate is hop dry and grassy. Decen.t
Fitgers Skyline Imperial Pale Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fitgers Brewhouse;Amber/Orange Coloring with White Skin. Nice Citrusy and Floral Hop Notes on the Nose. Solid Dry Hop Impy Brew with Some Ctirus in the Background. Crisp, Dry Finish, and Very Easy to Drink. Quite Nice.
Fitgers Skyline Imperial Pale Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fitgers Brewhouse;Copper color with a medium head. Aroma of pine and flowers. Very bitter and dry taste with ample amounts of wood and pine. Ridiculously smooth, especially coming from a growler. Damn tasty.
Fitgers Skyline Imperial Pale Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fitgers Brewhouse;GABF 2004: Pours a clear golden with a thinly lacing white head. Strange piney hoppy aroma with hints of fabric softener sheets and a touch of pale malty sweetness. Starts mildly candy sweet turning more grapefruity and bitter toward the semi-dry finish. An interesting, fresh-tasting, crisp strong ale.
Fitgers Skyline Imperial Pale Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fitgers Brewhouse;"From a growler, filled right up to the very brim! Pours out a hazy, deep orange hue, with a good, 1/4"" layer of creamy film with definite staying power, never left the glass. Nice hops in the aroma, with plenty of maltiness, as well. There’s a blended fruity factor, with nothing sticking out, a nice mix of berries, apples, strawberries, and distinct caramel undertones. i like this unique aroma, it’s sweet, but complex. And ever-so tasty! A pale ale that surpasses the usual in maltiness, in hops, and in alcohol, and attitude. This is an active ale, shall we say, has a lot going on, and I like that! Flavor never ends and looms large on the palate, just coats the senses and takes over. Thick mouthfeel, and just a shade away from cloying. An unusual take on a pale ale, that’s for sure, quite an uncommon drink, but one I can truly appreciate, and it’s certainly not for everybody! I have a hard time giving it a rating, for it’s so one of a kind, (though I know there other entries in the Imperial Pale Ale field, I won’t address that at this time), I must say that I can imagine returning to this again and again, from time to time. this is also my first full sample of Fitger’s beer, all the other having been small samples at festivals."
Fitgers Skyline Imperial Pale Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fitgers Brewhouse;On cask - Clearish off-gold yellow color with a finger high white head of tight whipped froth and tons of globby thick ink blot lacing. Aroma is super nice and soft with a playful hoppyness, amazingly complex but soft. Very flowery with good amounts of resin, well rounded citrus, super fresh cut pine and hay thats really interesting. Aromatic!! Lovely! It even has a nice touch of warming alcohol in there. But the soft complexity of this nose is just crazy nice! Taste has the alcoholic warmth right upfront, quite a boost at first and was served as one of the warmest cask beers I've come across so that really added to it I think. The hops are extremely mellow on the palate, very soft and delicate. Almost too much so, where they'd go? At first it seems the hops mix a little weirdly with the alcoholic warmth this has but after about half the glass this became a wonderful treat. The hoppyness seemed to end abruptly at first in a loft of nothingness but seemed to gain as you continue on. Soft pine, flowers, and playfully rounded grapefruit pops at the finish kinda late which made a nice effect. Overall this was very warming with just enough hoppyness to make it interesting. Feel has a nice and easy mellow cask feel and texture thats touching on fluffy. A big time warmer with soft subtle hops, kinda different, a strange twist on a pale ale, but pretty enjoyable. Did I say it was warm? Cozy...
Fitgers Black Paddle Porter;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Fitgers Brewhouse;Served on hand pumped cask. Clear chocolate brown pour, with a finger of super creamy fine mocha latte head. Peculiarly delectable aroma of light chocolate, cinnamon, and chipotle. Strong earthy and grass aroma notes show through. Casking leaves this beer a little watery than I wish it was. Great flavors of chocolate (mellowed with nuts), coffee with raw cane sugar and more fresh dug earth. A metallic note or two that detract slightly. Starts off with a rich band, but quickly thins out into watery chocolate. Palate is overwhelmingly watery, but not bad. Aftertaste is a dry nutty smack. This beer has been well roasted, not burnt, but is just average in my book. The malt is very rich and well done, which is nicely balanced by what seem to be a good dose of centennial hops. Retastes of this brew have found it with a thicker chocolate and coffee profiile, while other batches exhibit a more watery caramel style.
Fitgers Black Paddle Porter;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Fitgers Brewhouse;Dark brown color with a medium head. Chocolate aroma with a bit of coffee. Damn bitter chocalate taste. Much more of the espresso presence than a mild coffee. The malts are well roasted, but not scorched. Tasty!
Fitgers Black Paddle Porter;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Fitgers Brewhouse;Dark Brown Coloring. Good Dark Head... Aroma is Light and Not Very Revealing..But Flavor Takes Care of That...Nice Chocolate Flavor...Bitter and Coffee...Good Roasts...Little Dry at the End. Overall Not Bad At All!!!
Fitgers Black Paddle Porter;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Fitgers Brewhouse;Super thick dark brown, nearly black, big thick cocoa brown head thats nice and firm and sits a good while before fading to a skim and a puffy collar, sticky clumpy sheeting lace all over the glass, a nice looking porter. Nose is a bit subdued but is very nice to behold once you get into it, solid dry roastyness, chocolate tones and coffee. Taste has a very nice mix of milk chocolate that melds into a adequately deep roastyness and the coffee notes are just right with a nice touch of lightly drying finish and adds some cocoa touches too. Quite scrumptious. Solid medium body with a milky smooth and creamy texture. A great drinkin' porter, way better then the petroglyph porter that they had before. A top notch drinkin' porter in my book. Right up there with Bell's and Deschutes. Yum!
Achilles Serafijn Licht;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrouwerij Achilles;Long time ago since I tasted this, doesn’t exist anymore. I remember this as a deep peach blonde wheat beer with snow white head and fruity, bready and spicy profile, sweetish and a bit ethereal with bitterish finish, unusual for its style but all the more enjoyable just because of that.

Aroma fruity, a hint of porto, malts. Medium body. Taste = hoppy a bit coriander, fruity touch and spicy + bitter finish. Nice for a ""witbier"", but for me it’s not a witbier more a special."

Achilles Serafijn Licht;Heist op den Berg-Itegem, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Microbrouwerij Achilles;A Sim rate (Bottled from the Belgian Belly): Complex aroma. Mango chutney with a hint of sour milk, nutmeg, gooseberries and christmas cake. Cloudy, hella chunky and slightly lacey appearance. Looks almost like a peach spritzer. Initial hit of alcohol but the palate is a little thin so you miss out a little on the flavour. Subtle fruity tones and spicy finish. Nothing like any other witbier I have tried!

Kitzmann Edelpils;Erlangen, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Kitzmann;War oft beruflich in Erlangen und in der Minibar des Hotels waren immer 2 Flaschen Kitzmann Edelpils. Man kommt in Erlangen Kitzmann nicht aus - und ich fand das nur recht bedingt gut. Bevorzuge eigentlich Weissbier und da versagte Kitzmann ziemlich. Auch beim Hellen kenne ich vieles, was ich lieber trinken würde. Muss aber sagen, dass das Pils eines der besseren Biere von Kitzmann war. Frisch und recht herb. Deutliche Hopfennote. Guter Kompromiss aus Substanz und Süffigkeit. Damit kann man arbeiten. Echte Pilsfreunde wären vermutlich sogar begeistert gewesen. Nachtrag: Im Herbst 2018 ging die traditionsreiche Brauerei Pleite und wurde geschlossen. Die Markenrechte übernahm Kulmbacher, die auch die Produktion übernehmen werden. Auch wenn ich selbst absolut kein Fan von Kitzmann war, kann ich nachvollziehen wie enttäuscht und geschockt man in Erlangen ist

Kings Svetlo Pivo;Šentilj, Slovenia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Gostinstvo Belna - Pivovarna King's;"Started producing this one again after a hiatus. On tap at the brew pub. Pours a slightly hazy sunny yellow color, topped with a very generous and lasting white head; fine lacing. Obvious but not too intrusive sweet floral aroma. Some honey presence in there as well.

Kings Svetlo Pivo;Šentilj, Slovenia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Gostinstvo Belna - Pivovarna King's;Hazy golden pour.

Kovaško Pivo Svetlo;Zreče, Slovenia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Domača Pivovarna / Hotel pod Roglo;From a PET bottle that ogivlado brought from Zreče (thanks!) Poured a darker golden/yellow body. Fruity marty nose, hop, notes of passionfruit. The taste is dominated by a fine light lemony/piney hopiness, Goldings? Anyway, it’s really nice. The bready malty notes can also be felt and merge perfectly with the hop. There is a catch however, it’s watery. Some more body and maltiness and this would’ve been great.

Hier wurde aber keine der bekannten Marken genommen (möglicherweise um diese vor schlechter Rede zu schützen), sondern ein neuer Name entwickelt: Schützenbräu. Da es das Bier jetzt schon einige Jahre lang gibt, denke ich, dass es recht erfolgreich ist, obwohl es von den Diskontern billigere Eigenmarken-Biere gibt. Vielleicht hat man auch den Übergang vom Billigbier (Penner-Bier) zum bürgerlichen Leichtbier geschafft. Das Bier ist eher wässrig und man merkt deutlich, dass keine hohe Handwerkskunst dahinter ist. Man kann es gut trinken, weil es leicht die Kehle hinunter gleitet, aber der Bierkenner hat sicher nach einer halben Flasche genug.

Light to moderate, malty - lightly grainy and lightly sweetish aroma, light grassy hoppyness. Body is light to medium, malty - lightly grainy and lightly sweetish flavor, faint caramel, light grassy hoppyness, faint metal. Finish is short to average, malty - lightly grainy and lightly sweetish, light grassy hoppyness, faint metal. Watery and lightly sweetish lager - could be drier. Really nothing special.
Schützen Bräu;Wieselburg, Austria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wieselburger Brauerei (Brau Union);0,5 flaske delt med Petru, hjemme hos ham: vi hadde denne rett etter Eggenberg Bio, og vi følte ikke at vi ble noen bedre mennesker. Klar gylden med ok skum. Litt gress og urter, men ikke så mye annet å feste seg ved. Kjedelig pøseøl.

Samson Pito;České Budějovice, Czech Republic;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Budějovický Meštanský Pivovar - Pivovar Samson (AB InBev);Bottle from Tesco in Karvina (Czech Republic). Piana spora, no jak na pivo nealkoholicke jest nawet trwala, jasna klarowna barwa, pachnie zbozem, w smaku delikatne, chmielne, slodowosc malotka. pijalne, Ogolnie zadowalajace, wyroznia sie na tle innych lagerow bezalkoholowych, no i chyba srebrny medal w swojej kategorii na World Beer Awarsd w 2018 zasluzony.
Samson Pito;České Budějovice, Czech Republic;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Budějovický Meštanský Pivovar - Pivovar Samson (AB InBev);Bottle from the Albert near Florenc. It was 7kč (+3kč return fee) so who could resist a cheap tick! Pale golden body, fleeting white head.Initially skunky aroma (hey, green bottle, surprise surprise), which degenerated (hm) into the standard sweet worty soggy cornflakes with maybe a vague herbal touch. Sweetish taste, cardboard, dry, ends with a mild hoppy bitter touch. eh, this actually has sweeteners, but I'm not sure they are helping, since the sweetish soggy worty touch is what makes it shit, and they are probably making it more prominent, while traces of hops save it from utter failure. That, and the fact this was in a freezer for a while. Metallic around the edges. Wow, it has all the hallmarks of a generic shitty n/a beer, but, ice cold, I'd take it over... dunno, drinking my own piss?

Samson Pito;České Budějovice, Czech Republic;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Budějovický Meštanský Pivovar - Pivovar Samson (AB InBev);Pearl head, clear golden body. Lemon in aroma, grass, pale malts, note of bread. Tastes malts, grass, lemon, minerals - leading to a lemonish bready finish. Feels soft, quite lemonade’ish, I think too much lemonade. Overall fresh drink as chilled. [50cl green btl, BB.28.10.16]
Samson Pito;České Budějovice, Czech Republic;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Budějovický Meštanský Pivovar - Pivovar Samson (AB InBev);Bottle at home whilst watching Colbert. his was pretty rough honestly. Manky sweet wort aroma. Many sweet wort flavour. Subsides a bit as you go on and begins serving it’s purpose. Pretty bad though.
Samson Pito;České Budějovice, Czech Republic;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Budějovický Meštanský Pivovar - Pivovar Samson (AB InBev);Bottle from random Tesco in Brno. Merciless brutal lightstruck aroma right off the bat. Clear golden colour, almost no head to speak of. Actually once you get past the lightstruck this could be one of the better nonalcoholic beers. Yes, it has dull metallic bitterness, but so do all the others. There is a hint of actual malt and hops in the aroma and the taste though. You could do much worse. I wonder how this could taste out of a brown bottle. A little step for economic department at Budějovice, but a big leap for drinkers.

Cloudy light amber color with large, quickly collapsing head. Tart lemon/grapefruit flavor - very dry - a bit like a Lambic. Agree with Joris - the change to Celtik must have been a good thing - not spectacular but a nice tart beer.
Douar Men Rohane Blonde;Cléguérec, France;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Celtik (formerly: Douar Men);Orange tinted yellow-gold beer with yellowish, good head, receding. Chalk when pouring. Faint citrus, bit of malt. Weird taste. Again citrussy, with a little bitterness, as a moulded orange. Some ambrée malt. Retronasal little salty pinch, and a bit of chaff. Light to medium bodied, slight acidity burn. It’s not my favourite. But it would seem the change from Douar Men to Celtik has brought some healing changes, no, fiulijn?

Unser Bier Weizen;Basel, Switzerland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Unser Bier;Bottled, flip top, enjoyed by the Rhine with flocks of Swiss swimming by. Perfect for a hot weather like this.
Unser Bier Weizen;Basel, Switzerland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Unser Bier;Drinking and judging this beer, at the zoo in Basel, the last winter, in family. In my point of view, it is a classical weizen, nothing outside of the common. The body is orange and yellow, troubled, normal carbonation.There is aa side a bit sour and metalic, generous side of wheat and banana, perle hop that it is a bit a surprised for the style, giving a side of dryness.

Insgesamt nicht schlecht, aber kein ""1er"" Weizen! Test vom 30.1.2008, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 13,11,12,10,12,11 - 11,25"

I’d guess it is an ale and not a pilsner.
Unser Bier Fasnachts-Pils Drummler;Basel, Switzerland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Unser Bier;"33cl bb07/2016, merci Jan. ""Helles unfiltriertes Spezialbier für die drei schönsten Tage Basels"". - Recipe seems overhauled quite a bit since its launch, - both nose and appearance point in the direction of an APA/Unfiltered Pils style crossover. - Friendly cloudy, faint yellow pour. Smells faintly of vanilla cheesecake with gooseberry, a whiff of Citra? Fresh, gentle and fruity. Fluffy mouthfeel, very ale-like, or like a Franconian ungespundet Lager/Helles. Juicy zest meets sweetish fruits in body: maracuya quark Citra aspects. Nice noble hop bitter in the finish: German hops acting underneath the exotic dryhops? Very easygoing, down in a few gulps and somehow reminiscent of Hopfenstopfer’s Citra Ale approaching the same entry-level dryhopped sessionability from the lager direction, with a more pronounced and modernised hop bill."

Unser Bier Fasnachts-Pils Drummler;Basel, Switzerland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Unser Bier;Bottled 33cl. It pours a slightly hazy golden beer with a small white head. The nose is rather dissapointing. Hints of old socks, stuffy sitting room and vinegar accompanied by celery. The taste is of vinegar. Some vegetables (especially celery) showing up. Low bitterness. Medium bodied. Rather sweet and cloying, despite its lack of bite. Just simply unpleasant characteristics. Faint buttery finish with a hint of paprika. This beer reveals to be an absolute failure.

Aroma was coffee, light chocolate. Flavor was bitter coffee, bordering into astringent. Not much else.

They told me it was ""Squatters Cowboy Coffee Stout""; I assume this is the same beer. Black with a small, tries-to-last head. Aroma is coffee and cocoa. Flavor is initially the same, with some added char. But the flavor peters out halfway through due to the thin, watery body washing all the flavor away."
Hexhamshire Old Humbug;Hexham, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hexhamshire Brewery;On gravity at the Beamish Hall Winter Festival. Ruby with a cream head. A little malt vinegar at first before fruity notes and toffee. OK

Hexhamshire Old Humbug;Hexham, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hexhamshire Brewery;Pours clear and the colour of almost burnt caramel, slightly red, no head. Aroma is sweet, malty, syrupy. Taste is similar, an awful lot of syrupy sweetness, about as sweet as cola, a little cloying, some hops and a fair bit of malt, slightly spicy. Some alcohol in the finish. This might have some potential, but it’s too sweet for my liking.
Hexhamshire Old Humbug;Hexham, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hexhamshire Brewery;Cask conditioned at Harbury Beer Fest ’07. Brown with ruby hue, no head. I have to agree with Duff here, this had a sour background, big doses of butterscotch a touch of lactic acid, some tinny notes and altogether too sweet. Not pleasant.
Hexhamshire Old Humbug;Hexham, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hexhamshire Brewery;Cask@Twickenham Beer festival. We all know that cask ale can be fragile, and maybe thats what proved to be this beers downfall (lets hope), because i see Chris_o quite fancied this one. Way too much sweet butterscotch and caramel, so sickly that this was almost undrinkable, some citrus hops almost saves this beer from the overly sweet mouthfeel.
Hexhamshire Old Humbug;Hexham, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hexhamshire Brewery;Depp amber colour. Malty aroma. Malty taste too, but with some hops coming through. Good clean finish - malt lingers, but dry too. Medium bodied - not too chewy. A bit of a cross between a dark winter ale and a strong bitter (e.g. Fullers ESB), and a very pleasing hybrid it is. Not too cloying - just the sort of stuff I would choose to drink as a warmer, but some might find it a little thin for style authenticity. Handpump, The Speaker, London SW1.

Nose of grassy crisp hops, light pale malt. The flavor is hoppy, bitter, but still thin. The finish is thin and dry, meh. Needs some more malty notes to give a toasty character to balance the hops. Usually the hops just aren’t enough, it’s nice to see some people still miss the other side of the equation as well.
Bend Badlands Bohemian Pilsner;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Bend Brewing Company;On Tab at the BrewPub. Light pale malts and alight but fairly bitter flavor. Light, thin abd a long bitter trailer.
Ushers Winter Storm;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cask conditioned @ Humble Plumb, Soton. Fairly malty (didnt notice the whisky malt presence) in a sweetly muddled way. Drinkable but not one to have again.
Ushers Winter Storm;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cask conditioned.

Ushers Winter Storm;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cask Conditioned at The Dun Cow, Hornton, Oxon. Pale brown colour with a thin head. Confusing label on the cask, it would seem that the Ushers Brewery had never closed! I think that Refresh are desperate to get a winning beer and trying every wych way but to little avail. This was ok, thin malty body with a short finish, but when are we going to get some great brewing, I'd suggest forget the quantity of different names and styles do something with love.
Ushers Winter Storm;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cask @ Wetherspoons Wouldn't wash my feet in this muck!!

Brewed with whisky malt. Pale copper colour. Unusual aroma - greenish hops and sweaty armpit. There is an odd, slightly smoky flavour that is faintly reminiscent of whisky - more Bells than Lagavulin though. Nothing very assertive. Some slight citrus notes. Not very hoppy or bitter. Soft finish. Rather bland. Handpump, Adam & Eve, Westminster, London SW1

Franconia Notch River Driver Ale;Littleton, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Franconia Notch Brewing Co.;On tap at the ClamShell restaurant next door to the brewery: The Lure: A murky red envelope attempts to hide sweet fruitiness and miserable citrusy hoppiness, but in vain. This one’s going to be flat. The Festivities: Supportive cherries lift companion berries and earthy caramel from the muddy malt, but disappointment is unavoidable. A few grapefruits naively try to get attention in the distance. This is clear of imperfections aside from the fact that it is dreadfully still, flat. Transcendence: Punch Bowl: The Morning After.
Franconia Notch River Driver Ale;Littleton, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Franconia Notch Brewing Co.;Wow! All I can say is this ale did not cross the atlantic well. This is indeed a sweet ale with plenty of malt. But I find the head to be full and give off a nice balanced aroma of caramel, honey and bready malt. The flavor follows suit without all the stickiness usually associated with such an amber. As a matter of fact I found it rather dry on the end. Perhaps this Ale would be better off staying closer to NEW Hampshire.

The aroma is caramel, roast, coffee, a hint of chocolate, with a bit of a lactic and metallic aromas. The flavor is sweet with some caramel off set by roasted coffee but ruined by some annoying lactic, metallic, and phenolic flavors. Little to no hop flavor. Medium body with a light level of carbonation, and a sweet roasty mouthfeel. A stout with its rich roasty aroma and flavor can hide lots of flaws, this one does not. I’m not sure if sanitation is an issue while brewing or if we have dirty taps lines here, but this one is a mess.

Italian Oasis Black Bear Stout;Littleton, New Hampshire, United States;Stout;Italian Oasis Restaurant & Brewery;In short: A standard highly roasted pub stout. Sessionnable but forgettable. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Almost black body topped by a little tan ring of foam In long: A standard roasted nose. Taste is very roasted with a light cacao and light coffee flavours in the background. Malts had a cake-like flavour, an over-baked &#40burnt&#41 cake. A light vegetable sensation but not enough to be really bothersome. Hops take the form of some green grass. Finish is rather bitter but most of it seems to come from the high roastiness. Not bad, but this is exactly the type of stout that most below-average make. Italian Oasis, a place where everybody is a cousin and nobody complains about your personal hygiene.
Italian Oasis Black Bear Stout;Littleton, New Hampshire, United States;Stout;Italian Oasis Restaurant & Brewery;My Bottom Line: Roasted malts develop coffee connotations and bitterness, as light esters roam beneath this approachable yet unpolished Stout. Further Personal Perceptions: -There is no head at all atop the brown-hued blackness. -Lax carbonation and high dextrins make for a disappointing mouthfeel (for drinkability’s sake, anyway). -Powdery chocolate is tasted sometimes. -The finish is reasonably bitter, but there’s not much else going on there. On tap at the brewpub.

Italian Oasis Nutty Brown Ale;Littleton, New Hampshire, United States;Brown Ale;Italian Oasis Restaurant & Brewery;"The real name of this is ""the Cleveland Brown."" The pour is much darker than the typical brown to nearly black. If you were to look at it you would think you were gazing upon a Porter. The aroma is of sweet dark malts and nuts. The body was much thinner than I would have hoped. The taste had this odd caprylic note along with light coffee. It ended as a wet hop finish."

Archers New Years Resolution;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask conditioned at the Wenlock Arms, London. Absolutely crystal clear amber coloured body with a lovely white frothy head. Big sulphurous aroma that arouses the senses. Sulphurous flavour as well which transitions into a unique smooth palate. I can imagine many people not liking this style of beer, but this English beer has to be appreciated for its rawness.
Kasparus De Nagelees Pilsener;Nagele, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bierbrouwerij Kasparus;Slight vanilla and cabbage aroma. Slightly hoppy vanilla flavor. Fairly low on carbon. Surprisingly good, tasty pilsener. Pity of the lousy aroma. A bargain for € 0,60 a bottle in the local Nagele supermarket. A sample of Nagele 50 jaar pils, bought and tasted in 2006 tastes about the same, so I will not enter it seperately.

The aroma had a hint of coffee with some underlying caramel. The taste was suprisingly smooth for a stout, but had a nice subtle hint of coffee and chocolate. Lacing was observed throughout. Overall this was much nicer than I thought it would be, however, it was not really that impressive either. Worth a try, but that’s about it.

Aroma has spicy and floral hops and a clean grainy malt. Flavor is pretty much the same with a nice even bitternss at the finish and aftertaste.

Mild aroma with hints of orange and wheat. The beer itself seems a little thin, but it was well balanced and refreshing. It was sweet and the fruit flavor came through well. I am not a fan of coriander and it was very mild in this beer, which was nice. Solid beer, nothing amazing though.
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Belgian Wit;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at RB - Chicago. Poured hazy pale golden with a short cap of white head and some lacing as it descended. The aroma picked up drier wheaty notes with pepper, orange peel, and coriander spicage.. sweeter orangey notes swept in behind.. this hit the style rather well. The flavor had sticky honey, oranges, and pale malts at the core with wheaty tartness and lots of spices around (clove, coriander, and orange zest primarily).. spicy with a kinda vegetal finish. Lighter-bodied with OK balance.. too sticky at the back to really be refreshing. OK overall.

Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Dunkelweizen;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at RB Chicago. Poured a deep hazy brown with a cap of off-white head. Nose was very intriguing... bananas and cloves met rich semi-sweet chocolate. Flavor kicked it up a notch with a great balance between earth + chocolatey malts and the banana wheatiness. Somewhat of a cola feel on the palate, but remained smooth and had just enough carbonation to keep the flavors moving. Quite a good brew!

A dry and dusty finish. Low in body despite the low carbonation level. Easily forgettable.
Rock Bottom Chicago Terminal Dry Stout;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Chicago;9th October 2008.

Not bitter.
Rock Bottom Chicago Terminal Dry Stout;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Chicago;Tap at Rock Bottom Chicago. Very dark pour with a clingy brown lacing. Roasty nose. Coffee taste with borderline too much bitter. Very good.
Rock Bottom Chicago Terminal Dry Stout;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Chicago;draught at 2009 oak park micro brew and food review. in reference to chicagodri’s review below, i know i drank the same beer as him but i think this is an unnavigatable mess of the different ’terminal’ stouts/porters. i know for a fact i drank the terminal stout but it did not say ’dry’. i know they mentioned it had won two golds at the GABF. at any rate.....aroma is of sweet roast but low on chocolate with some bitterness lingering in the background. opaque pour with filthy head. flavor is of huge hops whose citrus combines with the roast to produce an odd ’grape’ flavor. rare to see a porter/stout hopped this heartily.
