Callys Oktoberfest;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);Growler from the brewpub, opened 10/23/10, filled about a week prior. Pours a clear copper color with a medium sized offwhite frothy head. Decent head retention and lacing. Aroma of toasted malts, caramel and grassy slightly metallic hops. The taste is grainy malts, lightly toasted, caramel, raisins and a grassy hop finish. Medium bodied, fairly high carbonation.
Callys Oktoberfest;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);On tap at the brewpub on 10/04/2008. Clear copper amber body with a medium creamy off-white head. Sweet toasty, slightly nutty and faintly grainy aroma. Sweet toasty flavor, more light nuttiness. Medium body with moderate carbonation and a very smooth finish.
Callys Oktoberfest;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);Draft at brewery. 6.0% ABV. Nice caramel and malt nose. Clear amber/orange. Malts dominate with a touch of graininess. Medium body and mouthfeel. Clean finish. Nice Oktoberfest.
Callys Oktoberfest;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);Draft at the brewpub. Pours a surprisingly dark amber with a very fluffy off-white head. This is the most head I have ever seen from a Cally’s brew. Nose is extremely muted. I really struggled to get anything out of it as cold as they serve it, possibly the slightest notion of bread malt. Body is fairly serious and heavy for the style, loads of malt and roasted almonds. Not complex by any means, but, very tasty and decent carbonation makes it fairly drinkable but not nearly as drinkable as most in this style (has to be when you’re drinking liters of it!). A very good effort, and I appreciate the pint on the house, I’m mostly just worried how true to the style it is. That said there are fuller bodied German oktoberfests in existence (I’m thinking Paulaner).
Callys Oktoberfest;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);Thanks again to Rob for bringing the growler! Medium amber, hint of brown, good head, attractive. Light bread aroma. Flavor was slightly bready, some hoppy bitterness on the finish, but no real hop flavor came forth for me. Almost like a muted version of their very nice Alt. Nothing wrong here per se, but nothing spectacular either.
Callys Oktoberfest;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);Nice beer to acompany bar grub, but not bold enough to stand on its own. As with most Calhouns offerings, the beer is well done but not overly impressive. Nice amber colour, good malty body, some subtle fall spice.
Callys Irish Stout;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);From the pub 4-19-09, thanks dkachur. Dark brown with a large head. Aroma was coffee and malt. Flavor was the same with chocolate.

Callys Irish Stout;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);Served on nitro at the brewpub. Pours an extremely dark brown appearing black in the glass with just the faintest ruby highlights showing through. Good head retention and lacing. Aroma of dry, nutty roasted malts.

Callys Irish Stout;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);[March 15, 2009] Pint at the brewpub, labeled at only 4% abv rather than the 5.6% listing here. This is a very dark red beer and obviously nitrogenated. Lots of bacon and dark chocolate are in the aroma with virtually no hop qualities at all. The palate is of course slick and creamy. Hearty bacon, milk chocolate, and dry cacao solidify this one as a straightforward interpretation of a classic dry stout. However, this is one of the better ones I’ve had recently. The very dry and very meaty flavor really did it for me.
Callys Irish Stout;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);on nitro-pours a retaining creamy tan head and pitch black color. Aroma is dark malt-roasty/coffee/chocolate, yeast, oatmeal, milk, acidic. Taste is dark malt-roasty/coffee, secondary hops-bitterness/acidic. Dry, medium body.
Callys Irish Stout;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);Sampled on draught at the brewpub in Harrisonburg, VA. Pours to a jet black color, with a thick, creamy, white head, and a moderate carbonation. The nose is excellent, with lots of good aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted barley. The palate is firm, with good dark chocolate, coffee, and roasty flavors. This beer finishes with more good coffee flavor, then ends with a roasty, and dry with a bitter bite that lingers. Very well done example of Irish/dry stout. Lots of good roasty aromas and flavors. Would match well with a number of dishes on the menu at Calhoun’s, and makes for a nice pint to enjoy at the bar.
Callys Irish Stout;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);(nitro) Black body topped by a creamy tan head that leaves nice lacing.

Callys Irish Stout;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co.

Deep dark colour, good aroma, and a nice creamy off-white head.

Draught House Half Wit;Austin, Texas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;On tap at the pub. The last batch of this beer rocked! Josh zested a crate of fresh oranges(Curacao oranges I think) to put into this beer. It pours a cloudy straw yellow with a creamy white head and lacing. The aroma is all orange and some vanilla and malt. The flavor has orange, banana, coriander, earth, and sweet malt. Very refreshing and drinkable beer.

This one had a distinct dish water note, soapy and mildewy, with lemon, florals, yeast, and the same chalky mineral note in all the others. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a bitter, chalky, mineralic mouthfeel. Was it poor glass cleaning or an off note? I think it was the latter, something I was sensitive to in the brew.

Downtown Joes Dancin Feet Red Wheat;Napa, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;Keg at the brewpub, 01/02/16. After enjoying the amber I couldn’t wait to get stuck into the wheat ale and a red juan at that !!! Golden amber with reddish hues topped with a light beige head. Nose is does not carry much, not offensive, just a lack of action ...airy malt, faint caramel, grain. Taste comprises fresh air, just nothing doing, touch of bread and light caramel.

Light-medium bodied, with moderate to medium carbonation and a malty mouthfeel that is also plagued by the same chalky mineral character in the other beers.

Downtown Joes Overdue Porter;Napa, California, United States;Porter;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;Keg at the brewpub, 01/02/16 as Rebob Porter.

Taste comprises toffee, light cocoa, grain, malt. Medium bodied, prickly and overcarbed, sweet and bitter rinse in the close. Pretty poor effort at a porter, almost like it was watered down.

Rebellion Plastered;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Cask conditioned. Golden coloured. The malty bread and grain aromas and flavour dominate this brew. Sweet bready flavour.
Rebellion Plastered;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Cask (gravity dispense), GBBF, August 2005. The beer was Plastered and, frankly, by this stage (beer #42) I was getting that way myself. Amber coloured. As usual with Rebellion beers, distinctly malty. Otherwise a fairly standard best bitter with no real highs and no great lows.

James Squire Brewhouse Currency Lad;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;James Squire Brewhouse;"An intriguing hoppy ""Bavarian style lager"". Arrives with a slight haze and a small, enduring head. Very fresh, hoppy aroma with some biscuity malt and limey tartness. Quite a ""green"" and enticing aroma. Medium bodied, with a smooth mouthfeel. Fresh and citric on the tongue, showing lychee and gooseberry. It’s a perky customer, but it became a bit sticky and cloying near the end of the glass. Bit too sweet for mine and not especially refreshing on a warm day at Darling Harbour. (Draught at the brewpub)"
James Squire Brewhouse Currency Lad;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;James Squire Brewhouse;21 Sep 05 - Fruity hop aroma with a touch of sulphur note. Cloudy yellow-orange colour with sheet lacing and lowish head. big fruit hop flavour. Tangy grapefruit bitter hop finish, but a bit over the top for me.
James Squire Brewhouse Currency Lad;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;James Squire Brewhouse;This probably needs to be renamed to include the reference to a lager because I am told the Sydney version is an ale. How odd. Served too cold of course and so there is a questuon as to whether the haze is due to the chill or settle in the keg. Very good head and eventual lacing. The aroma is soft and fruity with a hint of the hops to be sampled in the taste. I am told that the hop rate is about 50 IBU which is evident, as is a peachiness in flavour that I would have associated with an ale. There is a biscuity presence and a lightly malty profile that is a little unbalanced by the bitterness. Bitter on the back palate but not so parchingly so that you wouldn’t order another. Yeah, served in middy (sorry pot) glasses for $5 a pop.
James Squire Brewhouse Currency Lad;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;James Squire Brewhouse;"Called a ""Fruity Bavarian Lager"" Aroma: Initially sulphur followed by sour grapefruit and other fruity esters. Appearance: cloudy apple juice yellow with a flat head and some sheet lacing. Flavour: Some sweetness folllowed by lots of hop and grapfruit. Palata: Thin with lingering grapefruit bitterness."
James Squire Brewhouse Currency Lad;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;James Squire Brewhouse;"I was pretty fired up to hear the bar person describe this as ""very hoppy"" and damn, they sure were right. I have no idea what style to enter this as, they describe it as an ""intensely hoppy"" Bavarian lager (Helles?) but it really tastes like an IPA fermented with a lager yeast. It must’ve come on very recently because it looks like a milkshake - it’s thick with yeast and I think it affects the flavour. Pale colour, decent head anyway. Massively hoppy, citrusy aroma with sulfury hints of lager yeast underneath. Big Hallertau-esque character too; like Hallertau on steroids. There’s perhaps some (white) grape (not wine) character, but I was really searching for it because of the hop variety and any subtle nuances are lost when you have hops in such high concentrations anyway. Any malt flavour is overwhelmed by the massive, citrusy hop character, though the malt is obviously there because it doesn’t seem out of balance. Bitterness is big and very harsh to the point of really being a problem. I think the suspended yeast is making it considerably worse, but I’d imagine that even when it clears subtlety won’t exactly be it’s strong point. In any case, I think I’ll be re-rating this at several points in the immediate future so will report back. A very, very interesting experiment - good on the Brewhouse people for having a crack at something really (REALLY!) different. Also, the appalling use of capitalisation in the commercial description is the brewery’s fault, not mine. RR: Went back a couple of weeks after the original rating and it still hadn’t cleared to my surprise. Lots of passionfruit now which I didn’t get previously and a fair hit of sulfur which I don’t mind. It’s just still ridiculously harsh and bitter. The whole ""just shovel in a bunch of hops"" recipe they like to use works really well with Speculator but it doesn’t work nearly as well here. It’s like they didn’t realise that Nelson Sauvins are a ridiculously high AA% hop. Also, they no longer serve it in pints. They claimed it is because of RSA reasons because it’s 6% abv(!), though they’ve always served pints of the 5.5% Speculator. (I wonder if they serve doubles of spirits...) The cynical amongst us might suggest that they are doing it so they can charge $5 a pot... Dropping it 0.3 points."
Shed Triple;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Tripel;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Draught samples at New England Beerfest 2005 and Draught tulips at Redbones on 6/19 and 6/20/06. White head is mostly diminishing, to partial cover and a large ring, white in color. Low clarity, but more transluscent than opaque and a very strong peach-blood orange color, with some light amber tints in the middle. Fruits and spices is the game here, with a highly active Belgian yeast, quite authentically producing peach, nectarine, mango and other orange fruit esters. As well a highly spicy, phenolic effect is notable, drying things out on the end, as light breadiness and dusty, almost plant-like yeastiness pervades the end. Some light mineral/water quality problems are definitely noted, but it is far from strong or intrusive and allows the honey and graham cracker malts room to balance the spicy yeast character without leaving too much slick, hard mineral character. Spicy again in flavor, the palate is confronted mostly by yeast bi-products. Not overly dusty, funky or damp, but with a crisp, dry hay-like bite and some minor breadiness. The yeast provides most of the flavor, producing tons of spicy phenols. Slightly sweet at the beginning, but still at appropriate attenuation levels, it gains a strong, defining dryness on the end, bordering astringency, but for the loose, gentle carbonation that seems to soothe some of this. Trippels, to me, seem a product of yeast and proper attenuation and this one certainly scores well in both categories. The mouthfeel is loose and the carbonation weak, but obviously a product of the draught nature and not the brewing. In a bottle conditioned bottle, I could see this being quite well-done, strongly to style and nearly flawless (but for the light minerals noted from the Shed, showing up in some degree in all of their beers). No alcohol apparent in nose or flavor.
Shed Triple;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Tripel;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Draught at Red Bones 6/18/06 resampled 6/20/06. Pours a hazy golden color with a small white head. Head is bright and clean. Nose is quite fruity, lots of apples and citrus and fruity with soem light spicy yeast. Palate is crisp with a light syrupy body. Flavor is the same frutiness apples, grapes, spicy yeast and a nice crisp finish.
Shed Triple;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Tripel;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Thanks to weeare138. Pours a slightly hazy golden with a small white head. Aroma is belgian yeast and fruits.

Shed Triple;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Tripel;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Bottle shared courtesy of weeare138 (thanks!). Hand bottled from the brewer. Poured a medium golden color with small sized white head. Aromas of yeast, fruits, and some spices. Tastes of yeast, citrus, spices and a little fruity. Never would have guessed this one was 9%. Medium sweet with a lively body. A fine example of a style I find most American brewers fall short of.
Shed Triple;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Tripel;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Poured a hazy golden color with a small, white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrus fruits, light spices, melon, and yeast as well. Taste of more citrus fruits, candy sugar, tart apple, and more yeast as well. Alcohol was well covered up at 9%.
Shed Triple;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Tripel;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Appears a pale gold with a small white head and spotty lacing. Smell is of the Chimay yeast with a fruitiness and a tiny bit of caramel and pils malt coming through. Taste is of the same aromas, slightly heavy on the pils malt but the delicious yeastiness coming through with a fruity sugar that holds it together. There is a slight amount of corn syrup/pils malt coming through that is slightly outweighing the sugary goodness but it’s still a good beer with lots of superb Chimay yeast that is kick ass. Mouthfeel is sugary with the pils malt again kicking around. Drinkability is good. It’ll hold it’s own against any American Trippel.
Shed Triple;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Tripel;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;NEBF ’05 Appearane is cloudy and deep golden. Aroma of zesty fruit and spice. Flavor is moderately bitter witha restrained malty sweetness,bready,yeast,fruit and spice dominate.
Shed Triple;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Tripel;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Tulip at the brewpub, slightly too cold. Dull, brassy opaque amber, smallish lasting head...yeasty, fairly acerbic and strong nose, orange zest and oregano dominating with a bit of caramel underneath...lightly alcoholic flavor, dryish, full-bodied, moderate to strong carbonation, fairly yeasty, touch smoky, acidic...towards the end a bit too boozy, but well-balanced on the dry/sweet axis and quite drinkable.

Jako Mocne;¯elazków, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;JAKO Sp. z o.o.;No 215 Rated: 02.09.2007 Bottle brown, 330 ml, 15.0 P Appearance: Golden, quite nice colour of body, head is rather small and quickly decreasing to a small minimal froth. Head is white to grey, weak, rather foamy, body is mildly sparkling, carboantion is rather weak. No deepness of body colour, no lacing at all. Aroma: Alcohol quite dominating, some recognisable notes old wood used for making barrels, alcohol, rasins, syrupy, a kind of sweetness, some malted barley notes, a hint honey, rather no notable hints of hops but beer apart from alcohol domination. Flavour: Chalky, accidic a bit, well balanced between this two nice drafted flavuor, balanced between hops and malts, in flavuor no feel of alcohol what surprises after alcoholic nose, quite interesting thing is that the beer though Polish Strong Lager is not sweet. Texture is off-water but beer is not wattery, a bit saltyness, hoppy nose, finish is slaty. Palate: Finish is long, malty, alcoholic and hoppy nose, salty, texture is rather wattery.

Barley Johns Flemish Sour Brown;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Prototype Batch of Sour Brown. Very Murky Cloudy Brown Coloring with Red Tints and a Tan Head. Complex Brew in Aroma and Taste. Caramel Bittersweet Aroma. Sour Rich Mouthfeel...Would Be Extremely Hard to Finish a Whole Pint of This...Better a Snifter. Fruity Malt Texture, Almost Syrapy Texture. One of the Heartier Tart and Heavy Sour Browns I’ve Tasted. In Small Batrches, This Would be a Great Seasonal.
Barley Johns Flemish Sour Brown;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Barley Johns Brew Pub;"Another pull off the 5-gallon test batch. Musty attic aroma; totally unique. Virtually opaque body. Dark brown, off-white head with beautiful lace. Interesting flavors with a lot of sour and a dirty aftertaste, but in a good way. Very unique. Smoky, dirty, malty and sour. Nice, but since I’m not much of a sour guy, a bit hard to drink for my palate."
Barley Johns Flemish Sour Brown;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Dark brown-red. Good nose, sweet chocolate and cherry with some bright, sweet fruit like sniffing strawberry ice cream. Flavor is initially very sour, then some sweet fruity malts. Sourness is a mite odd, very cheesy. Maltiness has a strong weedy character. Not awful by any stretch, but it’s a bit like drinking a smoothie made up of cheddar and dandelions.
Barley Johns Flemish Sour Brown;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Barley Johns Brew Pub;A special five gallon test batch that will hopefully become a regular, or at least frequent guest on the taps. Pours a murky pitch red (if that makes sense) with a medium tan head. Outstanding aroma loaded with toffee and wrapped up with caramel and oak. Purckeringly sour on the first few sips, then mellowing off a bit. So much to taste... sour cherries abound with a dry malt base. Some syrup drizzled in for good effect. Almost a little grass as well. Possibly a bit of lemon. Dry finish. The final numbers may be a bit high, but I’m in love... Out-freaking-standing!

Derby Good Owd Boy;Derby, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Derby Brewing;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Dark, blackish beer, with only a small head. Very tasty stuff here, though stylistically uncertain. Very hoppy, with a delicious nettly, tangy finish. Thin in the mouth, with a slight carbonated feel. Could be an agressive Porter lacking smoothness, but probably closer to a US ESB, though very dark. Either way, I enjoyed this.

Biergarten Hefe-Weisse;Altötting, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Altöttinger Hell-Bräu;So now I had all beers from Biergarten, because even the retired ones were still available in our local bottle shop.

Nose of light yeast. Taste of light yeast, mild citrus fruits, cloves and green bananas. It is a very defensive beer and doesn’t really stay in mind.

Mandarin and a touch of banana in the flavor is almost totally overshadowed by a strong yeast character, but the fruit returns in the aftertaste. Not well balanced and disappointing.

Fuller's Vintage Ale 2005;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);This 50cl bottle had been chilling in my cellar for several years. Split four ways at a Christmas party, 2015. Pours a hazy amber with some creamy, sudsy, off white head. Nose has some signs of oxidation, but not terrible, dried orange peel, toffee, raisin, light port, a little fresh cherry. Flavor follows right along, malt, caramel, toffee, a little light candy, even a little cough drop, orange peel and a little spruce, some estery notes I have to assume are oxidation, raisin, port. Finishes a touch boozy, but otherwise dry. This held up exceptionally for 10 years in the bottle.

Carlsberg (Sverige) 3.5%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Sverige;Blik @ Nes Pä Hedmarken. Standaard pils met helder gele biertje en witte schuimkraag. Goeie bitter, moutig doordrinkbaar. En in de Zweden in de supermarkt verkrijgbaar als je zin in een pilsje hebt. Alleen door het lage percentage nog vlakker en wateriger als een standaard lager met 5 procent.
Lozen Boer Excellence;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Quadrupel / Abt;De Proefbrouwerij;750 ml bottle with cork & cage seal. Poured with a hazy, dark mahogany body topped by a thin tan head that was surprisingly durable and capable of leaving sheets of lacing. This has a lightly sweet front end and a moderately bitter finish. Rich, complex flavor with hints of dried plums, dates, raisins, faint spices and dark bread. Full, smooth body with some alcohol heat.
Lozen Boer Excellence;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Quadrupel / Abt;De Proefbrouwerij;"Super dark brown; smallish but stubborn head of tannish foam. With lacing. Smells roasty, abundant aromas of caramel malt and dark pitted fruit, a wee bit of vanilla. Leather. Taste matches but the vanilla is more upfront. Alcohol hidden so well which goes well with the smooth as silk mouthfeel. Call me weird but I reckon this is superior to the Chimay Blue. such a nice drop."
Lozen Boer Excellence;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Quadrupel / Abt;De Proefbrouwerij;Donkerbruin bier met mokkakleurige schuimkraag die snel wegebt. Aroma beetje azijnachtig met vleugje chocolade. Smaak is wel in orde. Beetje turf, hout, klein zuurtje, beetje zoetig (Chocolade, bruine suiker, caramel). Alcohol zit goed verborgen. Lekker, maar de blonde versie bevalt mij veel beter.
Lozen Boer Excellence;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Quadrupel / Abt;De Proefbrouwerij;Faint malt smell. Taste is malt and a slight bit of booze. Light to medium body, medium carbonation, and slight foam.

Lozen Boer Excellence;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Quadrupel / Abt;De Proefbrouwerij;bottle @ Party Town / Florence KY --- Hazy dark brown, beige head that drops rapidly to a cover, bands of lace. Aroma of malt and prune, along with other dried fruit. Taste is syrupy caramel malt that warms with alcohol on the swallow, showing prunes and raisins in a medium finish with very little bittering. Fairly, heavy in the stomach, thick, not a good example of a Quad.
Lozen Boer Excellence;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Quadrupel / Abt;De Proefbrouwerij;From a 75 cl bottle shared at home. Pors a hazy cola brown with an ecru head. Caramel aroma. Flavors of toffee. Smooth, sweet finih=sh.

Heartland Stumpkin;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Greenpoint Beer Works;Beautiful color, thick white head that floats so perfectly. Not a strong pumpkin flavor, but that's ok. Could easily enjoy several of these in a single visit. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Heartland Stumpkin;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Greenpoint Beer Works;Very good beer. Pours an opaque black color, no light passes through. Aroma is sweet and chocolaty, with the spicy vegetable flavor of the pumpkin ale, as advertised. Flavor is sweet but balanced out by some hoppiness. Full body, very complex flavor. Nice combination beer, probably my favorite thus far at Heartland.
Heartland Stumpkin;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Greenpoint Beer Works;A mixture of the pumpkin ale and tne farmer jon stout. Nice combination. While most Heartland barkeeps don’t know how to pour a proper black and tan, this is a nice fusion of 2 great beers.
Destiny Sweet Stout;Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Destiny Brewing Co.;Deep brown to black color, with a smallish off-white head. The aroma was dark chocolate and coffee, wioth slight cherry and molasses. The taste was roasty malty, on the sweet side, with more chocoff. Not terribly complex or bold in mouthfeel, this one was nonetheless very quaffable.
Destiny Sweet Stout;Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Destiny Brewing Co.;Just about black in color, just about no head whatsoever, very little lacing, subtle hints of coffee & chocolate in the nose, flavors of vanilla, chocolate & roasted malt, fairly smooth & medium in body
Destiny Sweet Stout;Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Destiny Brewing Co.;On tap at the Destiny Brew Pub. Poured a dark brownish color with red at the edges and an averaged sized off white head. Aromas and tastes of chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts with very light dark fruits in the background. Medium sweet.
Destiny Cola Beer;Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Destiny Brewing Co.;I applaud Emerson Haines for trying this style. The aroma is of cola, as is the taste, and the mouthfeel is very close to cola, but with a slight malt and hop finishing taste. Not a great beer, but you have to give props for originality on this one.
Destiny Cola Beer;Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Destiny Brewing Co.;Hopdog got it on the nose...if you love micros then stay away from this one. Very unique but also very strange. Tasted like it sounds.
Destiny Cola Beer;Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Destiny Brewing Co.;Very interesting beer, brewed with cola syrup according to the brewer, basically tasted like a glass of soda but with a tangy & sweet kick, brown in color, decent sized off-white head, seemed to have a bubbly mouthfeel, almost like drinking a glass of soda, but maybe that was just my mind playing a prank on me, very sweet flavors, unusual beer
Destiny Cola Beer;Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Destiny Brewing Co.;On tap at the Destiny Brew Pub. Bartender warned me, ’if you are into beer, you might not want to try this. This is brewed for people who don’t like beer - it tastes just like cola’. He goes on to tell me it is their Golden Ale brewed with Cola. Not sure how to classify this one. I initially passed but curiosity got the better of me. Poured a dark and hazy brownish color with a smaller sized head. Aromas and tastes of, guess what, cola. Sweet cola tasting. I’ve never had anything like it before (not that I would seek it out again, but interesting).
Carlyle California Common;Rockford, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Carlyle Brewing Company;Had a pint at the brewpub. Has the look of a redish IPA...clean look with a medium head. Has a solid aroma, lot of hoppy/citrus mix. Has a bitter, little too sour taste. Finish is good...rich, but again a little sour. Overall a good beer. Not the best from Carlyle but a solid brew.
Carlyle California Common;Rockford, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Carlyle Brewing Company;5.0% alcohol for this batch. Ruby red in color with a 1/2 inch thick, off-white head which leaves great lacing. Aroma is mostly an earth hopped scent with slight floral aroma with some malt coming through under the hops. Flavor has a bit of a Maris Otter malt and earthy hops notes up front (possibly some fuggles-ish hops), slight citrus in the middle with a semi-sweet ending with lemon flavor at the end. Medium carbonation and medium density make it heavy enough to the hold the flavor and not feel the least bit watery. Overall a great hopped up beer.
Carlyle California Common;Rockford, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Carlyle Brewing Company;"On tap at brewpub The california common style is one that I find hard to pin down. I’ve only had a few. They are good but I’ve yet to find one that would make me want to explore the style more. In this case it happened to be on tap and easy to get so I decided it was worth a shot. Aroma / Appearance - The bronze body had minimal carbonation and a half-finger off white head. The nose was slightly bitter with orange dipped chocolate and a subtle tea leaf base. Flavor / Palate - Creamy vanilla is offset by iced tea, caramel and malts. A light bitter aftertaste completes the experience. This was the first beer that really had an emphatic finish; it was not strong but there was something there. It felt a bit warm for 4.6% but not too intense. Overall this was a solid beer in a style that I just can’t get too excited about."
Carlyle California Common;Rockford, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Carlyle Brewing Company;The body is a golden amber and the off-white head is frothy and busy making lace. In the aroma a pale sweet malt is complemented by apples, pears, and a sturdy citric tang. The flavor has a blending of yellow and pink grapefruit that counter the smooth malty sweetness. Nicely done. Carlyle Brewing Company, Rockford, IL
Carlyle California Common;Rockford, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Carlyle Brewing Company;Had this one on draught as part of a sampler flight at the brewpub in Rockford, Illinois. Medium reddish gold pour with a foamy tan head, lots of citrusy hops and grapefruit throughout, dry finish. An outstanding brew.
Carlyle California Common;Rockford, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Carlyle Brewing Company;Draught @ Brewpub: This one pours a fairly clear darker amber/golden color. It had a big off-white head with lots of lacing. There is a faint whiff of grapefruit and sour malts to the nose. The taste is fairly typical of this style. It was slightly sour with hints of fruit. This was a decent example of the beer.
Carlyle California Common;Rockford, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Carlyle Brewing Company;"Sample at the brewpub. Dark amber with reddish inflections and thick lasting head (like nearly all of Carlyle’s brews I should note)...dry herbal nose, touch of citrus, grassy-grainy character foundation...moderately acidic, very citrusy, light with brown sugar sweetness, malty but quite dry and crisp, just a beautiful balance, touch of cherry-berry undertones can be faintly found as it warms. I don’t know the style well enough to determine the ""accuracy"" of this beer, but it is definitely my new favorite."
Carlyle California Common;Rockford, Illinois, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Carlyle Brewing Company;New addition to the menu, on tap at the brewery. Dark copper with a medium short lasting frothy good lacing leaving head. ’sweaty’ grains in the nose, almost musky and tart hops and barley-ish in the taste up front more sour in the back. Interesting and quite drinkable. It was different than I expected and as the drink sat for a bit it developed more.
Carlyle Black Walnut Stout;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Stout;Carlyle Brewing Company;Draft at carlyle. Ppurs black with a half finger of dark brown head. Aroma of coffee and dark chocolate. Taste is light bitter. Mostly coffee with caramel, chocolat and a slight hint of fruity on the end. A little nuttiness but less than i was expecting. Medium-light bodied with a thick texture. Soft carbonation but a very long finish. Overall, very good. Been wanting to try this one for a while
Carlyle Black Walnut Stout;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Stout;Carlyle Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub, pours black with a thin tan head, aroma is of heavy chocolate, nuts and a good amount of wood notes as well, the flavor has a nice touch of coffee on the front end with a finish of almonds and chocolate, somewhat of a thin mouthfeel, pretty darn impressive.
Carlyle Black Walnut Stout;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Stout;Carlyle Brewing Company;"Served with a root beerish looking head; very thick, foamy head that sticks and stays for the whole drink. Very black and heavy looking with a light coffee hints and some nuttiness for the aroma but the beer as a whole has a very light aroma too it. Flavor has a nice bitter roastedness to start and moves into a slight raisin taste, followed by a strong walnut flavor and ending with a light coffee note to mix with the walnut. Overall, was a bit surprised at how well the nuttiness came through in the beer and would definitely recommend giving this one a try."
Carlyle Black Walnut Stout;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Stout;Carlyle Brewing Company;"On tap at brewpub This was the second to last sample before continuing our trip down through Indiana and Michigan. It was much like the regular stout with a hint of walnut. The two are similar enough to be almost interchangeable. Aroma / Appearance - A deep black body swirled fluidly around the sides of the small glass. A thin tan head sat on tap from the time they gave me the glass to the time I finished the five ounce sample. Coffee, almonds and peat tickle the nose along with charcoal. Flavor / Palate - The earthiness is a little different than the normal stout but the coffee is not. Black walnuts are obvious as well after a few seconds. This one is a bit smoother than the normal stout; given a choice between the two this one gets the slight nod."
Carlyle Black Walnut Stout;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Stout;Carlyle Brewing Company;tap at the brewpub-new batch that was just put on tap 12/22. pours black with a small soapy tan head. nutty aroma starts with roast, char, anise, dark chocolate and somewhat lactic. char becomes more present as the brew warmed. roasty, nutty flavors start with lots of char combined with the nuts on the finish. really quite interesting and tasty. very sharp roast. almost astringent, but in a good way-melds well with the big walnut flavors. body is a little lite, but given the alcohol content., this little boy is a session stout. drink up, because this is the best beer you can find in Rockford at this time.
Carlyle Black Walnut Stout;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Stout;Carlyle Brewing Company;Pours opaque dark brown with thin dissipating tan head, no lacing. Nutty aroma with dry roast grain and coffee. Big bursting flavor of toffee, coffee, roasted grain with moderate to medium roast bitterness. Big thick creamy palate. Man, this stuff is tasty.
Carlyle Black Walnut Stout;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Stout;Carlyle Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. Dense black with a small, dark creamy head...lots of roasty, burnt grains and licorice in the nose, and yes a hint of black walnut...the body is oily, nutty, with vanilla creaminess throughout...fairly short and lightly acidic finish....the nose really exploded after a few minutes, offering deeper and deeper drafts of dark candy-nutty goodness and some fresh if muted coffee...a delight.
Carlyle Pilsener;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlyle Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub Given that it might be a while before I make it out this way again I did a full flight of everything on tap. It was mostly lower alcohol (4 to 5%) beers which made it easier. This was the first sample and a good way to kick things off. Aroma / Appearance - The clear golden body had a small quarter height head. The nose was nice for a pils - lemons, oranges and hoppy. It’s fun to find a brewer who knows that pilseners should be more than a lifeless golden alcoholic drink. Flavor / Palate - Oranges play against the lemony bitterness. The hoppiness is evident but not strong. This is a nice starter beer and very sessionable. It would be easy to drink a few of these over dinner with friends.
Carlyle Pilsener;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlyle Brewing Company;It’s always nice when a brewmaster remembers that a Pilsener should have a healthy dose of hops, and that’s the case here. From the tap is pours a hazy bright yellow body with a smallish frothy head. It’s got a sweet grainy aroma with a solid grassy/floral bittering. This is a good crisp, dry drink. I almost would’ve thought it to be a German Pilsener. The hops are quite assertive, making the finish both bitter and dry. Very nice. Carlyle Brewing Company, Rockford, IL
Carlyle Pilsener;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlyle Brewing Company;Had this one on draught as part of a sampler flight at the brewpub in Rockford, Illinois. Cloudy, medium yellow pour with a thick, fluffy white head, pretty hoppy with a pleasant dryness. Finished bitter. For a pilsener, this was awesome.
Carlyle Pilsener;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlyle Brewing Company;Fresh, well blended pilsner. Crispness and Saaz hops make this a pilsner perfect for summer.
Carlyle Pilsener;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlyle Brewing Company;Light golden body, not much head. Light cereal aroma wiht grassy hops. The flavor brings in crisp hops (strawberry leaf and stem) over cracker pale malt. Bitter, hoppy finish. A good flavorful brewpub pils!
Carlyle Pilsener;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlyle Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. Sweet almost honeyish nose emanating from the light golden, well-laced glass...Saaz seems to be the hop in the crisp, snappy body that ends up being sweeter than most but has just enough bite to keep it a drinkable pils.
Carlyle Pilsener;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Carlyle Brewing Company;On tap at brewery, clear with a thin head that is short lasting. The nose is mostly grains but thin. The taste is just about the same with more... I want to say barley... here and there. For a pils it was different in that there was something actually there that was not water tasting. Very drinkable.
Fitgers Cherry Edmund Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Fitgers Brewhouse;Bottle thanks to Todd. Pours a black color with a small white head. A huge smoke and vanilla nose. The flavor is big bourbon, cherries, smooth, hot. Awesome. Big beastly oxidized bourbon.

Fitgers Cherry Edmund Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Fitgers Brewhouse;[On-tap at Fitgers] Pours black with a nice tan head. Aroma is chocolate, cherry, strawberry, honey, brown sugar, streusel and some coconut. The honey and cherry really makes it. The taste is cherry, restrained chocolate, some charred malt, toffee, coconut, some green pepper, moderate bitterness and a nice dose of honey. Really nice, the charred malt blends beautifully with the cherry, honey and chocolate. Fairly thick mouthfeel, silky smooth, and a long finish of plum that is slightly dry. Really nice--basically dessert in a glass. I wasn’t a fan of the regular Bourbon Edmund, but with the cherry it is way, way better.

Fitgers Cherry Edmund Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Fitgers Brewhouse;Winterfest ’10. A black, thick, rich beer. As a general rule, I don’t like bourbon-aged beers, but Fitgers knows how to do it right. The cherry is immediately evident before the glass is even near my nose, but the bourbon is also unmistakable, and because there isn’t too much of it, it doesn’t overwhelm the other qualities. Some vanilla aroma and flavor, with a lightly sour cherry flavor underneath the dry malt body.
Fitgers Cherry Edmund Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Fitgers Brewhouse;On draught during the Winterfest 2008 in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota. Lucky me to have tried this beer. Pours an opaque nearly black brew with a fast dissolving beige head that dissipates clean. Aroma of bourbon whiskey, roasted dark malt, tart cherries, and a touch of coconut. Taste is thick and strong, smooth with flavors of roasted dark malt, tart cherries, some vanilla and a touch of yeast. Finish is strong alcohol character with aftertastes of whiskey and cherries. Maybe a little bitg of cherry NyQuil but still very enjoyable.
Fitgers Cherry Edmund Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Fitgers Brewhouse;Black as night with faint brown head. Sweet and slightly tart cherry aroma with a complex blast of the usual bourbon suspects - oak, vanilla, & funk and some bourbon biscuit. Smooth body with similar flavors to the aroma.
Fitgers Cherry Edmund Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Fitgers Brewhouse;Black as they come. Sweet cherries hit ya first, followed by the bourban, a decent one-two punch. This was a lot better then i would have though, as the cherries didnt overpower their already good stout.
Rock Art River Runner;Morrisville, Vermont, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Rock Art Brewery;Growler. Faintly hazy gold with a tinge of copper, moderate quick-diminishing head leaves a smidgeon of foam...malty/grassy nose unfortunately beaten down by butterscotch, which appears again in the flavor though some decent crisp grassiness shows up late...fairly thin and dry at the finish.

Lucky Lager Force 8;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);It’s not offensive, drinkable and worth the money, has no outstanding qualities but what do you expect in a cheap high alcohol content beer.

Lucky Lager Force 8;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Can-Sparkling light gold. The head rose and fell in about 5 seconds. The aroma is like stewed peaches and corn with added booze for a bonus. Quite sweet rotten fruit like flavour, very grainy, not as alcoholic as I expected,but as this warms it gets much worse and is hard to get down. My first drain pour in quite some time. Thanks joey!
Lucky Lager Force 8;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Trip to Vancouver and it came back with me. Pale golden colour with nasty alcohol/chemical flavours. Some malt liquors hide the alcohol...not this one. A bit fruity at first but ultimately collapses into an oilly cloying mess. Too many off flavours. I expected it to be worse....
Lucky Lager Force 8;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);8 % mass produced beer. what do you expect? Piss yellow, fat white head. Corn and lots of it for flavor. Makes me want to hang out in a ditch with my rifle.
Lucky Lager Force 8;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);A golden lager with a thick creamy white head. Aroma of strong methane and sulfur. In mouth a rather sweet concoction, with the said apricot, rather short in mouth, and ...gratefully...forgotten. Drainpour. Evil perpetrated by the Capflu...evil, I say.

Sierra Nevada Schwarz Beer;Chico, California, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Draft. Served at least 10-12 degrees too cold at Mills River.

Sierra Nevada Schwarz Beer;Chico, California, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;On tap at The Trappist. Pours jet black with a nice beige head and treacle aroma. There is a smooth dark molasses flavor that is a little watery with a slightly piney hop finish.
Sierra Nevada Schwarz Beer;Chico, California, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Draft. Dark pour with light able to peak through, thin wispy head. Soft somewhat malty nose with a hint of roasty and a hint of crisp hopping. Flavors subtle but clean...nothing peaks out too much though, not overly roasty or malty though..just kind of easy drinking and plain. Subtle hints of diluted licorice possibly...doesn’t jump out as an overly flavorful schwarzbier, probably legitimately traditional but I’m used to the american versions that take that shizzy to the next level. Unoffensive though, so its got that going for it, which is nice.
Elmwood Lawnmower Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Poured a pale yellow color. Head was bubbly and white with pretty good retention and lacing. Aroma was of light malty caramel and molasses with a hint of medical adhesive tape. Citrusy, tart, and effervescent. Flavor is sour lemons and malty cereal grain. Overly carbonated, not a great beer.
Elmwood Lawnmower Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Thin-bodied and weak tea flavoried waste of time. This is NOT a Golden Ale! This is not even a real lawnmower beer! Slight lemony twist in the finish just to make me feel better about the ten minutes of my life that I’ll never be able to get back.
Elmwood Lawnmower Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;#987. Bottle. Thanks to whoever brought this to the White Elephant exchange at the Chicago Area gathering at Flossmoor station. Hazy light yellow thin with no head. Nose is thin, hippy but fruity, taste is very lemony sour and newarly apricotty sharp extreemly carbonatied.
Elmwood Lawnmower Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Thanks to Beerdrenched for the taste and to vyvvy and thegreenrooster for the good gathering. Filtered and lemonade hued. Sparse white quickly dissipating head. Light bodied with a bready citrus flavor. Crisp and sweet with a candy flavor. Easy, but not bad. Just light. Good for what it is.
Elmwood Lawnmower Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Pour is a cloudy yellow with no real head. Aroma is very sweet with a bit of fruityness in there. Flavor is buttery with some citrus and lemon. A bit watery but not as bad and most are saying. Could be a good session beer.
Elmwood Lawnmower Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Consumed with sneagrams3, thegreenrooster & Beerdrenched - thanks to Beerdrenched for supplying this ale. Pours light yellow with a small white head that leaves instantly. The aroma has grassy hops and a bubblegum sweet malt with some fake fruit and perfume. Light body that has a touch of chalkiness and bits of sharp carbonation. Taste has lemon / lemongrass flavors with the finish getting a bit more sour and some sweet-tart flavor. Not my favorite, but better than the butchering it is taking here.
Elmwood Lawnmower Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;bottle-ya know, this isnt as bad as some of the previous ratings. pours very pale yellow with light carbonation and a small wispy white head. citris, lemon and sour notes on the nose. flavors are sour lemon and a smashing of light pale grains. really is quite refreshing, but not on a 35 degree night! body suffers from light/watery texture. better than their horrid amber ale for shure!!!!
Elmwood Lawnmower Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Light-hazed pale golden with dead carbonation and a quick, white head. Lemony, pastry-like aroma to start before leaving an overall impression of Froot Loops in a bowl of sour milk. Spoiled yogurt flavor backed up by a roasted graininess. Sourness lingers in a phlegmy coating over the mouth and throat. Time to gargle and hit the sack. Bottle courtesy of Cornfield. (Thanks again, buddy.)
Elmwood Lawnmower Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Purchases as a 4 pack of 12 oz bottles at a local liquor store. Aroma of lemon similar to a bottled ice tea dominates a rather clean none complicated nose. Malt aroma low, hop aroma low. No honey aroma. Pours a pale yellow, small white head with large bubbles falls quickly but maintains a lace. Hazy. Dry front leads a balanced bittered middle. Over attenuated front to back with little malt flavor. Finishes crisp and dry with a hint of sourness. Oxidized earthy lemon after taste lingers. Light bodied with ample carbonation. Refreshingly dry. A beer that focuses on dry and light. The honey is muted but adds dryness. Lemongrass adds a Lipton tea essence. I would prefer more complexity from malt flavor and less oxidation. Interesting to try, but will not purchase again.
Elmwood Lawnmower Ale;Elmwood, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elmwood Brewing Company;Very pale straw bodied with a short-lived, fluffy white head. It smells like lemon and, appropriately to the name, fresh cut grass. The flavor has traces of malt, but mainly tastes like an off lemonade... which I would prefer drinking given the choice.

There’s very little in the flavour at all. Not great.
Atlantic Blue;Treisaac, Cornwall, England;Porter;Atlantic Brewery;Bottle shared in London. Gusher! Pours hazy brown with lots of floaties and a creamy tan head. The aroma holds dry, toasted grains, some earth, dusty cocoa. Light sweet flavor with tangy berries, raisins, plums, grainy bread. Light bodied with lively carbonation.

Atlantic Blue;Treisaac, Cornwall, England;Porter;Atlantic Brewery;Half-pint, cask, at the CAMRA Oxford Beer Festival on 18th Oct 2014. Dark ruby red with a full head. Very sweet from the off: caramel and toffee nose and taste, no hop bitterness or aroma. Too sweet even for my sweet tooth, long time since I’ve said that about a British brewed beer.
Atlantic Blue;Treisaac, Cornwall, England;Porter;Atlantic Brewery;Cask conditioned at Oxford Beer Festival ’14. Dark reddish amber with white head. Straight into toffee bomb territory, sweet caramel, metallic notes. I really couldn’t get on with this.
Atlantic Blue;Treisaac, Cornwall, England;Porter;Atlantic Brewery;Bottle from the Cornish Brewer’s Alliance at the Royal Cornwall Show. Pours dark brown and slightly murky. There was a hell of a lot of sediment in this bottle. Small cream head. Not very flavourful for a porter. Fairly fruity malt notes and some earthy flavour from the yeast. A bit of a home brew feel to this one.
Atlantic Blue;Treisaac, Cornwall, England;Porter;Atlantic Brewery;500ml bottle from Beers of Europe. Pours clear reddish brown, no head. Aromas of light toffee, red fruit. More toffee on the taste. Thin finish.
Grand Union One Hop: Galena;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask (St Albans 05): Gold with a white head. Mildly hoppy aroma, a little earthy. Flavour is similar, simple malts with a earthy, slightly citric finish. Alright, but a bit one dimensional.
Grand Union One Hop: Galena;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. These Grand Union single hop beers aren’t always successful. Partly because the methodology brings the particular hops strengths and weaknesses into sharp focus and, frankly, some of the hops just don’t work in isolation. Secondly, the hop levels sometimes seem a bit timid, presumably so as not to discourage the non-hopheads. No complaints about this one (although I would have preferred a bigger hop presence). Attractive bright gold colour. Clean and dry, with plenty of bitterness. Crisp mouthfeel. Not as aromatic as I would have expected but that could be down to the rather unimpressive condition of some of the beers at this festival rather than the beer itself.
Grand Union One Hop: Galena;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - St Albans BF - A golden coloured beer with a good sticky marmalade hop aroma. The taste is again nice and hoppy. Good thick body with resiny hops and lots of flavour. Enjoyed this greatly.
Grand Union One Hop: Galena;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. I would love to do a horizontal tasting of all of these One Hop beers as I think that they are a great idea. This one had a golden orange colour with bubbly white head. Really good hop nose with good citrus and green hop flavour. SilkTork was banging on about the brewery, but I don’t care, these are cracking beers.
Grand Union One Hop: Galena;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask@The Wenlock Arms. An American hop i haven’t previously heard of. This was like a cross between soething like the cascade hop and the pride of ringwood from Australia. Aromatic, with touches of lyhcee and aroma from the cascade and some rusty, green kiwi fruit from Pride of Ringwood. Touches of grapefruit and pine, quite bitter in the finish.
Atlantic Gold;Treisaac, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atlantic Brewery;Bottle from Beers of Europe. This was a total gusher. Lost about a third of it I reckon. When what was remaining settled down there were big funky notes and a general lack of and malt and hop flavours. I don’t generally like ginger in beer but on this occasion it did actually improve the situation.

CJs Brandy Cask Medium Dry Cider;Usk, Wales;Apple Cider;CJ's Cider;From the barrel at GBBF, August 2005. Hazy orange colour. Spirituous, petrolly aroma. Quite tannic, so comes over dryer than it actually is. No fruit to speak of. Odd, and slightly hard going. But I rather like difficult ciders.
CJs Brandy Cask Medium Dry Cider;Usk, Wales;Apple Cider;CJ's Cider;From the barrel - GBBF 2005. A slightly hazy orange coloured cider. The aroma is really juicy apples and pears. It is in the taste that the brandy flavours come through. It is quite intruiging but very dry with too much brandy alcohol tastes. After a while the taste actually made me wince.
CJs Brandy Cask Medium Dry Cider;Usk, Wales;Apple Cider;CJ's Cider;Alcohol, solvents, bitter appleskins, lactic aroma. Hazy yellow gold. Very still. Boozy, solvent-like flavour compounded by lactic yogurt-like fruitiness. Medium body is sticky and coats the teeth. Barrel at GBBF 2005.

Full Sail Vesuvius;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;From Aug 2007 I got this bottle in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks, John! Pours from 22oz bottle(2006 vintage) a hazy orange-gold with a large head of foam The smell is all fruity and yeasty and spicy. I get sweet malt, sour apple, coriander and probably more. The taste is very sweet and tart at the same time. The tartness is from the sour apple while the sweet is from candy sugar and they balance each other out pretty nicely. I'm also tasting some banana and some pepper after a few more sips and the alcohol is starting to become more noticeable...tastes stronger than the given 8.5%abv. Btw, I'm drinking it near room temp to get the most out of the flavours and well, it's pretty tasty but I find the finish is kind of bland and watery. Oh, and peppery. Man, there's a lot of that in here now that I've had a few more sips. The mouthfeel is light as is the carbo. I see some sediment at the bottom of the bottle so I'll save the rest of my comments until that's poured in my glass. Ok, I'm sipping on the last of this Belgian Strong Ale and nothing's changed. I think it's decent but there are much better out there in the style. Still worthy of a try though.
Full Sail Vesuvius;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bomber. Found in random liquor store in COS four years after bottling. Aroma is mostly malt and banana with some unidentifiable spice. Pours golden with with a thin, white head and very little lacing. Tastes like a Belgian to start with the sweet malt and banana notes. Finishes strange with spice and alcohol mixed in. Might have been better 4 years ago. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Full Sail Vesuvius;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle @ home. I just found this still on the shelf in Denver. I remember liking it two years ago- lets see how the sucker held up in fluorescent light the last two years. Somewhat cloudy, golden orange appearance with an off white head. Soapy floral, a touch earthy (?), bready, herbal, slight citrusy aroma. Herbal, soapy, floral hoppy, light orange citrusy, bready yeasty flavor. I thought I enjoyed this two years ago but maybe I was just a shithead. This is ok.
Full Sail Vesuvius;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle at the Funky 6. Pours gold with a moderate, white head. Strong malt aroma with yeast, spice and Belgian sugar. Sweet flavor, malty, with light yeast and fruit. Medium to full bodied with average carbonation. Finishes sweet with Belgian yeast notes. Good.
Full Sail Vesuvius;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;22oz bomber. Hazy, unfiltered golden-tan color. Thin, steady off white head. Sweet, sugary Belgified aroma. Doesn’t really do the style justice, very par to sub-par US version. A little bit thick, chewy, with some clove-like balance. Rich, with some alcohol laced fruit tones..banana, orange, tangerine. Lacks the effervescent mouthfeel and delicacy that can make the style great. Sort of goes for an Orval like thing, but doesn’t quite get there. OK.
Full Sail Vesuvius;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Pours a nice gold color with too small a head for a Belgian-style ale. Smells like a hef - grains, light caramel malts, some honey... just a tad sweeter. Flavor adds a bit of tropical fruit - maybe even some banana - it’s definitely trying for the profile of a Belgian golden ale, but it’s falling short. It needs to be livelier, with some better yeasty depth. As is, for lack of a better term, it’s too macro.
Full Sail Vesuvius;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bomber. Pours golden with off-white clings. Lots of spice and bubblegum in the nose. Tastes of bananas and bubblegum--not a good combination to me, but makes an adequate golden Belgian.
Full Sail Vesuvius;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Thing has a really nice nose of alcohol mixed with summer public pool and some astringent accents. What follows is a little messy, like someone tried to blend a perectly fine high alcohol tripple with a Belgian Brune or something similarly sour. Taste has some band-aid and alcohol mixed with what could be a great golden ale. Too funky for me.
Full Sail Vesuvius;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;2009 22 oz. bottle from Plaza Liquors - Pours a crystal clear golden color with a small off white head. No real lacing to speak of. Aroma is Belgian candy sugar, esters, and yeast. Flavor is much of the same with the addition of herbal hops. Medium body. A deceent beer.
Full Sail Vesuvius;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;"22oz bottle purcahsed at Cedar City UT ST Liquor Store.

Hampshire Indian Summer Ale;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hampshire Brewery;Bottle. Golden with an off-white foam. Aromas are spices oranges with citrus sourness. Not much else. Flavours are oranges and sharp lemon. Traces of sweet hops. Dry and sour towards the finish. Yet another tainted Hampshire bottled beer. If they can’t be consistent, they shouldn’t bother.

Hampshire Indian Summer Ale;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hampshire Brewery;Sep 07 Gravity Cask @ Royal Oak Beer Festival. Scratchy malt with full toffee. Not quite enough hops. 2.4 Sep 06 Cask conditioned @ Cuckoo Inn, Hamptworth. Tasty hops with fruity spice component. Easy going body and mild finish. Quite nice, but could be slightly more assertive. 3.3 Jan 06 BCA (from Bottles of Botley, BBE Sep 06). Despite having had several bad bottles I thought I’d give them another go. Unfortunately the initial aroma smelled like an acidic infection. The first taste was acidicly infected. THe beer itself was still moderately sweet with some citrussy hops but not enjoyable. 1.1
Hampshire Indian Summer Ale;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hampshire Brewery;Cask@The Market Porter, Borough, London. Kind of tasted like a bitter to me. Some toffee-ish malt flavours, grainy. With some lightly flowery citric hops, tastes of ingredients, and not much else, not bad.
Full Sail White Knuckle Wit;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;OBF dinner 05. Pours a cloudy yellow with a soft white head that falls fast. Spicing is mild, doesn’t have the massive orange peel and corriander of the popular wits. This was much more subtle, more like a wit/blond. Hops are grassy and the finish is crisp.

Full Sail White Knuckle Wit;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Draught at the Hood River brewery: Opaque yellow. Spicey, perfumey aroma. Light, slightly estery profile, floral and mildly spicy. Malty finish. Well-balanced but a bit normal...I think history has shown I prefer a lot of deviance from the norm when it comes to wits.

Small white head that dissipates to a small ring and leaves little lacing. Nice coriander aroma with a touch of clove. Light bodied with decent carbonation.

Appears to be brewed and distributed by Sudmeister GmbH. according to a qr-code on the back label. ABV 5,1%. Poured into a big english pint glass. Deep amber to light brown in colour, big soapy tan head on top. Good retention, light lacing on the glass. Lots of malts on the aroma, some chocolate notes and a faint hops smell. Not bad. Nothing of it is on the taste though, very blant and boring. A bit metallic on the aftertaste, where a bit of roasted malts can be found, giving this beer a short lasting bitterness. Medium thin on the body, average carbonation. Only a little bit dry on the palate. We could be talking for at least an average beer, if it had some little initial taste.

Richly hoppy with grapefruit and flowers upfront. Medium sweet with evident crystal mat character. The amount of aromatic hops is really surprising me, and throughout it’s a really well made beer. A well made, hoppy amber ale is a standout thing in Poland, and I’m really enjoying this one. A big thanks to the top guy who runs the Szynk Ale House who opened earlier and served me the Relakspol beers.

Tangy, orange-accented fruitiness with a hint of soap. Perfumey, smooth and (by local standards), chewy. Very impressive, and sneaking towards authentic cask English hop goodness. you’ll need an oxygen tank to sample it at source, though. Be warned.

Poured deep slightly hazy amber with a good-sized off-white head, nice lacing. Very interesting dry toasty caramel malt aroma, quite a lot of funky, almost barnyard-y hops - nicely herbal, light fruit and sneaky yeast character - I’ve never smelled a beer quite like it before. OMG that’s good - very, very hoppy, but fresh, pungent euro-hops, enough malt to carry it - balanced mid-level herbal bitter finish.

Aromas of espresso coffee and dark chocolate. Flavours are pretty much the same though slightly on the thin side. Not the best porter I have ever had but not too bad all the same.
Hargreaves Hill Porter;Steels Creek, Victoria, Australia;Porter;Hargreaves Hill Brewing Company;Something just wasn’t right with this. Very aussie style porter - chocolate and cereal are quite noticable, but thin body and over carbonation for the style dilute the finished product.
Hargreaves Hill Porter;Steels Creek, Victoria, Australia;Porter;Hargreaves Hill Brewing Company;330ml. Well balanced bitterness that leaves a smoky aftertaste. Rich dark black in colour with an inviting tan head and an aroma ofcoffee and roasted malts with a hint of chocolate underneath.

Hargreaves Hill Porter;Steels Creek, Victoria, Australia;Porter;Hargreaves Hill Brewing Company;Bottle: Deep brown with a light brown and very short lived head. Looks like Coke after a minute or so. Slightly vegemite-like cola nose with a touch of underlying roastiness. In the mouth it’s light soy sauce and chocolaty toasted malts. It’s quite thin but the pleasantly flat carbonation brings out the more sublte aspects of the flavour profile. I think this has promise but needs some work on bringing some character tot he party.
Hargreaves Hill Porter;Steels Creek, Victoria, Australia;Porter;Hargreaves Hill Brewing Company;Upon entering the glass a dark caramel colour, it produces a beige collar that disperses to lace quite well. Aromas are quite intense tending towards creamy coffee and milk chocolate. Medium bodied with quite lively carbonation (due to bottle conditioning). Palate produces hints of darker malts with rather dry hop bitterness to finish. A nice, simple expression of the style
Hargreaves Hill Porter;Steels Creek, Victoria, Australia;Porter;Hargreaves Hill Brewing Company;Bottle (330ml). Poured a very dark brown (almost black) with a small, rocky, tanned head which was average lasting. Aroma was of dusty milk chocolate and licorice with roasted malts, black coffee and some caramelized dates. Flavor was of roasted malts with tart blackberries, coco powder, black coffee and some licorice in the finish. Medium bodied with medium carbonation a dry/creamy mouthfeel, watery texture and an ok finish. A bit thin.
Hargreaves Hill Porter;Steels Creek, Victoria, Australia;Porter;Hargreaves Hill Brewing Company;Black with a small tan head, great lacing and reasonable retention. Big charcoal aroma, lots of smoked malt and chocolate too, as well as some porridge oat notes. Silky mouthful, body is perhaps a little on the thin side, which accentuates the charcoal flavour a bit. Other flavours include earthy english hops, cocoa, vegemite, and some light toffee malts. In the end its pretty damn dry, with the vegemite flavour lingering past the others. Not overly appealing.
Park Tavern Summer Blue;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Park Tavern Brewery;There is a beer down the street from this place called Sweetwater Blue.

Appalachian Major Hops Olde Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft at C-ville. Pours turbid caramel brown with frothy off-white head. Nose is earthy grainy vienna malty, with brown sugar, and resiny hops. Tastes medium in palate, with a somewhat sweet and earthy malt flavor, quite a big brown sugar bite, and the hops are an accompaniment to the malt rather than the forefront.
Appalachian Major Hops Olde Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Dark amber pour with a small off-white head. A little hoppy and some malt aroma. Flavor is a bit hoppy, some sweetness, and a little dry. Decent enough.
Appalachian Major Hops Olde Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);On cask @ ABC Gettysburg. Deep amber with a creamy off white head that leaves some lacing. Spicy hop aroma with lots of sugar sweet scents. The flavor is mostly sweet malt with some bitterness that fades in. Medium body with mild carbonation (cask) and a somewhat watery mouth feel. This was a good beer, but nothing special.
Appalachian Major Hops Olde Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);definitely not 80 ibu, aroma is malty, with nutty and toffee notes. poured dark amber with white head. flavor was the same as the aroma, quite nice and with great malt complexity. medium bodied. very enjoyable.
Appalachian Major Hops Olde Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);On tap @ Camp Hill. Pours a deep copper color with a lasting white head. Sweet caramel aroma, great malty backbone, not much else.
Appalachian Major Hops Olde Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);on tap-pours a thin light tan head and copper color. Aroma is very mild citrus/earthy hops, medium malt. Taste is sweet medium malt-nutty/peat, secondary dry/earthy/metallic hops. Same as an English Nut Brown. OK carbonation. Occasional.
Appalachian Major Hops Olde Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Piint at the Harrisburg brewery, Muddy, bready brown colored body with some faint red hues as well, topped by a thin, tan, disorganized head. First impressions of the nose are sweet caramel malts, toasted bread, and cherry scented hops, but with some bakers yeast and wheat bread dough. Thin on the tongue, sweet, with a light bitterness, mostly just more of the caramel and cherry flavors that are fairly common in the so-called American strong ale. Hoppy for sure, but not grassy. Has a semi-gritty texture of soggy bread and grains, finishing pasty and dry, soggy and sour. Overall it’s very loose and disorganized, at tiumes resembling a strong amber ale, other times a DIPA that went wrong somewhere. They call it major hops but the hops are more minor, to be honest.
Appalachian Major Hops Olde Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Had this on tap at their brew pub in Gettysburg. It’s pretty good and a little hoppier than their Hoppy Trails. Would definately recommend to an IPA lover
Appalachian Major Hops Olde Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);ABC fest 06. Pours a slightly hazy deep amber with a htin off white head and some lace. Aroma is citrus and piney hops but balanced out with a lot of chewy thick sweet caramel malts. Flavor is moslty sweet with some fruits, toffee, caramel, citrus, orange, and some pine- with a good clean bitterness in the end. Fairly smooth and easy to drink. Due to the high hop levels I would consider this to be more of an american strong ale, rather than an old ale.
Appalachian Major Hops Olde Ale;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Old Ale;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);not a bad brew, but i was expecting something really hoppy. It’s not much of a departure from ABC’s IPA, mixes hops with a hint of candy sweetness.
Wissey Valley Cherry Stout;Downham Market, Norfolk, England;Stout;Wissey Valley;A - Rich dark black put against the light you get a red hue. tan pillowy head that lasts the entire beer S - Chocolate, cherries, metal, malt and a hint of alcohol. Not a heavily scented beer and the alcohol only came through towards the end Taste - like it smells, minus the metal and alcohol, which I was pleasantly surprised by . very sweet, but just what I am looking for after dinner this would go great with dessert or a cheese plate. . . tonight, for me, it was dessert. Sweet chocolate cherry aftertaste, may be too sweet for some, but i like it sweet and right now it suits me just fine. M&D - A bit carbonated at first and I wouldn’t think about drinking more than 1 (and I am splitting this 500ml bottle with the wife). Good for the moment but this beer is made for certain moments, meals and moods.

Aroma of toffee apple, caramel and a sourness like the runoff liquid from a kitchen scrap bucket. Not promising. The taste is wierd and oddly reminded me of Minneapolis Town Hall Breweries’ Thunderstorm Belgian ale: It was the gust of sweet Belgian candy and a little soapiness that made the connection. But then I tasted a wierd sourness that was... wierd. A husky bitterness built through and lingers in a mild barnyardy way. The body was light but very smooth, especially after the other beers from this brewery. Overall, it was very promising with some good elements (the body, bitterness and sweet edge) but overall it was just... wierd!

Flavour was medium, with plenty of juicy, dryish pear fruit followed by naturally syrupy finish that made me think if tinned fruit, with a touch of tartness.

New Belgium 2° Below Winter Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Very good and quite refreshing. Interesting to drink and have while enjoying a movie. It is highly well brewed.
New Belgium 2° Below Winter Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Wow that is a great beer! Pours golden orange with a floral smell. Carbonation is perfect and it leaves palate feeling satisfied ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
New Belgium 2° Below Winter Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);From Dec 2005 I had this on tap at the local Old Chicago: Poured a nice reddish gold colour with a small head that dissipated before it even got to me.(Nitro-CO2mix) The smell was hoppy and sort of fruity. The taste was a mix of fruit and hops up front with more of the fruit in the middle and huge hop bitterness in the after taste that lingered like forever. The latter part of the drinking experience I liked muchly but....I've tasted better winter ales and since this is a draft only product, there's no need for me to seek it out. That makes only 2 brews from New Belgium that I'm not really pleased with.(the other is the Loft)
New Belgium 2° Below Winter Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Nice winter style brew. The aroma is a balanced blend of malt, hops and a touch of spice. The hops provide a dry mouth feel that cleans the palate with a slight after taste.
New Belgium 2° Below Winter Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle. It pours a clear amber color with a slight off white head. Light nose with a hint of malt and grain. Light florals as it warms. The flavor is mostly caramel and malt. Don’t get much hop wise. Easy to drink.
New Belgium 2° Below Winter Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);bottle. Poured clear amber-orange with nice lacing. Aroma of hops both spicy and citrusy. Medium body, creamy carbonation, buttery mouthfeel. Malty base, sweet and spicy, notes of toffee, pepper, citrus peel, herbal hops. I nice balanced brew, the higher alcohol is well hidden.
New Belgium 2° Below Winter Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);bottled - expected this to be a dark beer (stout or porter) for some reason. Just found out it’s an ESB. That makes more sense. Nice amber color. Typical ESB flavor but with a spicy malty flavor.
New Belgium 2° Below Winter Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I poured it from the bottle into a glass. It pours amber with a nice head and lacing. The aroma is hops and fruit. The taste is hops, dark fruit, and caramel. This was better than expected.
New Belgium 2° Below Winter Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pours a cloudy, amber color with a white head. Aroma is mostly malty with a hint of citrus hops. Flavor is mostly the malts with some earthy tones and spices as well. Hint of the citrus hops on the finish.
New Belgium 2° Below Winter Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"DATE: January 5, 2016... OCCASION: returning from a cold night at LVR, the mood is right for a winter warmer... GLASSWARE: Corsendonk tulip pokal... a swirling storm of small bubbles rush through the glass and create a dense snow pack of white, clumpy head... body itself is copper and clear--appreciable at a distance... immediate peppercorn, earthy seed, melon, resin, vanilla, and toasted malts--enticing and warming, with a kick of attitude... a flowery earthiness also joins the fray, as does toffee... buttery, slightly oily, and active at the tongue--hops are present, but this medium-bodied beer doesn’t really rest any one specific place... a mild finish that exits without much fanfare... no insult, but not a standout in this regard... toffee, caramel; light flower, pepper, spicy herbs, a bit of lemon, and maybe some honey--enough to set up shop and sip for study or slam with abandon... as the glass drains, serious snow smears down its side... I see this not as not on par with other NB work, but a relatively high ceiling has done this to me... solid, especially as part of a winter mix, and the second and third bottles will not go to waste...serviceable, but not in the upper echelon of winter beers..."
Archers Evening Star;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);NIc,e a little bitter. BUt good settling process. The colour is a little light.
Archers Evening Star;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask, Eden Arms, Doncaster. Light chestnut to orange colour, thin white head.

Clear amber coloured body. Covering white head. Caramel malty nose. Malt-fruity flavours of orange, dough and toffee. Rounded bittersweet tail. True to the style and pretty alright. (18.02.2017).

Absolutely fowl, may have been a bad batch ? Nose was canabis resin, oil,pine resin, ivy leaf and a bit of tropical fruit. Taste was dank, musty, canabis, grass, vegetable, sulphur.
Schlafly Hop & Rye;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Saint Louis Brewery;"1079, on tap at the taproom in early August. I am placing this beer here as my notes have it listed as ""Rye Beer"" and I too see that others have placed thier rating here. From notes: Lighter golden no carbonation, thin white head that expanded. Nose sharp with malts and chemically, taste sweet and caramelish to almost tin like. Interesting but barely palatable."
Schlafly Hop & Rye;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Saint Louis Brewery;"draft @the tap room. i think this the beer i had, but on this night it was only listed as ""rye beer"". so i guess this was it. light and golden in color , this one pours with roughly an inch of foam. grainy aroma is more or less all i can find in the nose. mild sweetness and medium body with a fine grainy flavor. good citric hop bite on the finish."
Schlafly Hop & Rye;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Saint Louis Brewery;"I’m guessing this was what I had (labeled ""Rye"" on the board). On tap at Schlafly Tap Room. Poured clear bright golden with a short, well-retained cap of white head. Sweet caramel, vegetal notes, and orange marmalade provide an odd and almost astringent nose (if smells can be astringent).. refreshing kick of pineapple appears late. The flavor picked up odd spices again in limbo (vegetal, settling on pineapple).. pale malt and sweet caramel backing.. simple sugars pick up at the back-end. Light-bodied and kind of pointed at times with ugly vegetal remnants on the finish. Not good."
Schlafly Hop & Rye;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Saint Louis Brewery;Cask at the Taproom. Pretty light colored, surprisingly, with an almost golden hue and a firm white top. Gristy but fruity, tarty and smooth with a bitter-twist finish. Almost lemonadey. Good summer choice. (#3018, 7/14/2007)
Schlafly Hop & Rye;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Saint Louis Brewery;On cask at the brewpub. Pours a hazy lemonade yellow with a thin white head. The nose is a sweet lemon with lightly grassy backing. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and silk-smooth with a clean finish. While I liked the characteristics the cask imparts on this one, I think it might actually be better on tap. The flavor is a sweet, round rye, grass, and citrus. This is a nice summer session and second only to the Export IPA on this visit.
Schlafly Hop & Rye;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours pale yellow with a white head. The aroma is lightly sweet with citrus hops and light pine - no rye noticeable on the aroma. Medium crisp body with unobtrusive sharp carbonation. The taste is quite crisp with some APA traits with the up-front hoppiness of citrus and pine and there is a hint of dryness from the rye. The finish has rye coming more to the forefront. An overall good refreshing summer beer. This would be nice to have a six pack of, but it isn’t bottled.
Schlafly Hop & Rye;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap at The Tap Room. Pale yelow appearance with a not too impressive head, though there is some lacing. Mild wet rye bread aroma. Dry bitter taste with the slightest hint of malt sweetness and rye. Bitterness remains on the palate and in the throat. Not overly impressive, but interesting anyway. Served colder and in the summer, this would be an excellent seasonal refresher.
Schlafly Hop & Rye;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Saint Louis Brewery;Pours a fairly light yellow, with a large head. Aroma is fairly fruity and sweet, bright citric notes and sweet honey, becoming toasty and malty and slightly bitter towards the end. Pretty good.
Schlafly Hop & Rye;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Saint Louis Brewery;Hop in the City: While I liked many of Schlafly’s beers, this was not one of them. It was underwhelming with its light lager-hop flavor below an overcoating of rye. Its subdued aroma offered little that was inviting — weak malts and a touch of grain. Overall: Average.
Schlafly Hop & Rye;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Saint Louis Brewery;Hop in the City - Dry, flat aroma is overloaded with rye and not much else. Lightly hopped body is drinkable enough, but comes off as spritzy and malty as it warms. Almost PBRish. Just OK.
Schlafly Hard Cider;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Apple Cider;Saint Louis Brewery;Pretty standard cider. Clear and crisp. Sweet, very mild spices, has a lingering dryness.
Schlafly Hard Cider;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Apple Cider;Saint Louis Brewery;Keg at the brewpub, 12/16/16. Clear pale golden, thin fizzy white head, decent retention.

Schlafly Hard Cider;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Apple Cider;Saint Louis Brewery;Draft at taproom. Pours Apple juice color with no head. Smells like apple juice as you’d expect. A bit on the dry side but not particularly memorable. Finishes a bit watery. Not my fave thing from these guys.

Schlafly Hard Cider;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Apple Cider;Saint Louis Brewery;This beer pours a very clear yellow with a medium white head that fades quickly.

Schlafly Hard Cider;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Apple Cider;Saint Louis Brewery;Tasted at the 2014 Schlafly Hop In The City festival in a Berliner Weiss sampler glass. It poured a clear yellow colour with just a few weak bubbles. Looked, smelled, and tasted exactly like fermented apple juice. Yawn.
Schlafly Hard Cider;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Apple Cider;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap. Comes a clear pale gold with a tiny white head. Aroma of apples and tastes of apples. Nice balance of sweet apples and tart apples. A nice cider.

Smells of apple juice, champagne yeast, and a hint of tartness. Light lemon peel. Flavor is a bit simple. Tart lemon and apple, yeast, and apple skin. Quite dry. Not bad.
Walnut Brewery Salamander Amber;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Walnut Brewery (Rock Bottom);Tap. A lighter amber bodied beer with a fast disappearing head. An off balanced ale with a mild malty aroma.
Walnut Brewery Salamander Amber;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Walnut Brewery (Rock Bottom);Draught. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is light amber. Aroma is lightly malty (cookie), moderately hoppy (grapefruit, orange). Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. A very citric ale in both nose and flavor balance. Difficult to enjoy, but admittedly more aromatic and flavorful than most Walnut beers.
Odell Dortmunder Lager;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Odell Brewing Company;Tap at Odell. Pours a translucent golden with a creamy white head. Aroma of bready malt, lightly grassy, citrus and noble hops. Flavor of bready malt, lemon, crisp and dry.

Average duration, light sweetness, acidity, and bitterness.
Odell Dortmunder Lager;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Odell Brewing Company;Tap at the brewery. Malty with a good touch of honey or syrupy sweetness. There is some grain/husk flavor, but it plays well with the sweetness. A very easy to enjoy beer.
Odell Dortmunder Lager;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Odell Brewing Company;clear golden yellow with a nice white head smells of sugary candy and malt. has a grassy hop taste in there with a straw finish. an easy drinker that is odd in it’s malty way. but good. honey flavor to this. aroma is grassy too. the straw flavor mixes well with the sugary malt.
Odell Dortmunder Lager;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Odell Brewing Company;Draught. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is dark yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (bread), lightly hoppy (resin). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter, slightly husky. Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation. A bit grainy and not the right kinda hops for the style IMHO, but it’s ok.
Ommegang Rare Vos - Super Hop;Cooperstown, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brewery Ommegang (Duvel-Moortgat);This was a special recipe released at the Harvest Festival in September. Orange amber color with a nice big head from the tap but quickly diminishing to a thin white film. Definitly different than how I remember the regular Rare Vos. This had less spice in the nose and a solid but mild hop aroma. The flavor was well blended and solid. Hops and malts blend nicely to create a very drinkable beer.
Angry Minnow Tommy As Oktoberfest;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Angry Minnow;Nice barnyard aroma, immediate brightness is a bit disconcerting. Followed by a pretty average Octoberfest. A bit of copper, like blood in the finish.
Angry Minnow Tommy As Oktoberfest;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Angry Minnow;"On tap. Pours a cleard dark copper, almost chestnut hue. Thin but persistent head that leaves nice lacing on the sides. Aroma is dry, crisp, toasty and nutty. Flavor is much the same -- dry, toasty, nutty with hints of fruit esters and light to moderate hop bitterness. This thing tastes for all the world like a nut-brown ale. I can’t detect much of anything that would identify it as a festbier, save maybe the color, and only becaue festbiers come in a wide range of colors. Nice solid palate that coats the entire tongue with every sip yet is not cloying at all. Don’t get me wrong, this is a pleasant and very drinkable beer; I gave it low marks for stylistic reasons only."
Angry Minnow Tommy As Oktoberfest;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Angry Minnow;"On draught at the brewpub in Hayward, Wisconsin as ""Tommy A’s Oktoberfest."" Pours a semi-clear dark coppery amber brew with a slow dissolving creamy off-white head that has good lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, a hint of brown sugar and some flowery hops. Taste is semi-sweet, very lightly carbonated with a medium body character. Flavors is very faint with roasted caramel malt, toffee and some roasted nuts. Finish is semi-sweet, a little on the light side with a caramel aftertaste. No bitterness during the finish. An average Oktoberfest."
Angry Minnow Tommy As Oktoberfest;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Angry Minnow;Pours dark brown with thicker creamy colored head. Malty sweet aroma with notes of caramel - mild flavor with a dry finish.
Angry Minnow Tommy As Oktoberfest;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Angry Minnow;Great Taste of the Midwest Not very memorable, for some reason I grabbed this on the way back to sit down. By the time I got there it was gone so my notes are pretty thin. As a result I have to forego the usual routine. The body was a deep smoky black with a dirty cocoa head. The flavor was not bad but at the same time sort of bland. Very drinkable though forgetable, this one was neither outstanding nor terrible.
Angry Minnow Tommy As Oktoberfest;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Angry Minnow;Dark Gold Coloring with Dar Cream Skin. Malt and Sweet Apple Aroma. Sweet Malty and Caramel Notes with a Dry Hop Aftertaste..Decent Okt. Offering.
Angry Minnow Tommy As Oktoberfest;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Angry Minnow;Light malt aroma. Dark brown pour, with tan head. Flavor is dominated by barnyard and oats, with some wool blanket and a hint of grass. Interesting, but quite a departure from a traditional Oktoberfest, not that there’s anything wrong with that. Finish is clingy sweet.
Angry Minnow Last Notch Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Angry Minnow;Draft. Hazy yellow with no head (garnished with a lemon). Aroma of wheat, citrus (lemon), spice, yeast funk, and some bubblegum notes. Light body, citrus, yeast funk, lemon, and some phenols.
Angry Minnow Last Notch Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Angry Minnow;Pour is a cloudy yellow with a large white head. Aroma was creamy and spicy with a touch of banana in there. Flavor is mild cloves with a grity grain. Finish is kinda watery. It started out well.

Angry Minnow Last Notch Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Angry Minnow;This one was delivered from the Angry Minnow tap.

Angry Minnow Last Notch Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Angry Minnow;Sampled on draught, this beer poured a cloudy bright golden colour with a full white head.

Angry Minnow Last Notch Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Angry Minnow;(growler thanks Skyview) Pours a hazy light gold with a white head.

Angry Minnow Last Notch Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Angry Minnow;Growler from Skyview. Served very cold and I think that dulled the aroma and flavor. Citrus and wheat in the flavor, some bubblegum, and a little sour. Banana in the aroma and flavor. I do like it. Cloudy yellow appearance.
Angry Minnow Last Notch Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Angry Minnow;On draught at the brewpub in Hayward, Wisconsin. Pours a hazy lemonade golden brew with a fast dissolving white head that leaves behind a white ring and some spotty lacing.

Twin Ports Deutschland Ueber Alte;Superior, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Thirsty Pagan Brewing;BLBF. Nice murky brown pour, with a foamy head of off-white. Rich fruity hop aroma. Cascade and floral flavor, but nicely balanced with caramel and toffee. An exemplary example of a well balanced beer in an interesting style interpretation. Finish is dry.
Angry Minnow Honey Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Angry Minnow;Enjoyed at Angry Minnow. Nice if understated flavor of grain and citrus hops. Kind a vegetable flavor which adds a bit of complexity. Ok, but don’t need another.
Angry Minnow Honey Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Angry Minnow;Tap at Angry Minnow on Nov. 18, 2011. Clear orange pour with a small white ring head. Mild grain and honey nose. Medium to light palate. Taste is grain, sweet honey, and a touch of butter.
Angry Minnow Honey Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Angry Minnow;12oz bottle picked up in Wausau. Golden-orange, slight haze but looks filtered. Thin, oily head. Odd, grainy aroma, slightly off. Clearly has some off tones, a trashy vegetable flavor and aroma. Cheap 6 row or adjunct tones. Kind of a joke for 8.99 a six pack. The honey smooths out what is a pretty unimpressive beer. Lacks depth.
Angry Minnow Honey Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Angry Minnow;This one was recently from the tap at the Angry Minnow. It was delivered with the last lace of the original head and of course had the golden honey color. The taste was light as expected, with a moderate honey type sweetness. No cloying though. The hops were just enough to balance. Not earth-shattering, but very good.
Angry Minnow Honey Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Angry Minnow;Pours a semi cloudy golden colour with a medium white head. Aroma is firm on the honey, very sweet and enticing. Mouthfeel was suprisingly very creamy, again noticeable honey, lemongrass and bready malt flavors.
Angry Minnow Honey Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Angry Minnow;On tap. Pours a nice clear golden with small white head that leaves bits of lace in its wake. Aroma is dry, of pungent hops and crisp grain. Flavor is similarly crisp and dry with moderate hop bitterness and a light sweetness. Nice tingly palate with a grassy finish. Not a great beer, but certainly a good one.
Angry Minnow Honey Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Angry Minnow;Hazy amber color with a thin off white head. Malty nose with some sour twings to it. This may be too old. There is honey sweetness and a light bready malt, but it is coated with a sour, lactic acidity. Orange juice hops in the finish. Drinkable. I wish I could tell how old this bottle is.
Angry Minnow Honey Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Angry Minnow;Thanks to Skyview for this one. Dark gold pour with small off-white head . Light nose of malt and honey. Flavor is much the same with just a touch of hops. Finish is rather carbinated and almost unpleasant.
Angry Minnow Honey Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Angry Minnow;Thanks to Skyview for this bottle. Carbonated light brown pour with faint lacing. Faint honey nose with hints of malt. Subtle hops with honey undertones and some faint malt for balance. not bad.
Angry Minnow Honey Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Angry Minnow;Murky copper color with a very thin head. Sweet, yet stale, honey aroma. Slightly soured wheat taste. Not much honey, just a dry powdery-like finish. Certainly had far worse, but not a big fan.
Muskie Capital Bavarian Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Muskie Capital Brewery;On draught at the brewpub in Hayward, Wisconsin. Pours a hazy golden pale yellow brew with a fast dissolving white head that has some light lacing and a thin white ring. Aroma of tropical fruit, yeast, a touch of banana and cloves. Taste is light to medium bodied, some light carbonation with flavors of multi-grain white bread malt with wheat, some banana esters, cloves, a touch of white pepper and some citrus zest. Finish has a light almost watery texture but has some nice balance flavors of multi-grain malt and some clove aftertaste.
Muskie Capital Bavarian Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Muskie Capital Brewery;ABR 2006. A disappointment, and more of an American wheat because it lacks flavor and aroma, and isn’t even cloudy but at best a kirstalweizen. Light wheat aroma, only a hint of citrus and no banana at all. I am not getting any cloves. Some sweet wheat in the light flavor. Thin and weak palate. These guys make better beers.
Muskie Capital Bavarian Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Muskie Capital Brewery;(Tap) Pours hazy yellow with little head. Typical fruity and clove notes. Quite watery throughout. Overall not bad.
Muskie Capital Bavarian Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Muskie Capital Brewery;Yellow Coloring with White Skin. Belgian Yeast Aroma and Taste. Citrus and Light Spice Notes. Overall Lacking in Depth and Flavor.
Muskie Capital Bavarian Wheat;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Muskie Capital Brewery;Standard lemon, clove and hexane aroma. Cloudy lemon yellow pour, no head. Falvor is a standard wheat run. Feels extremely watery. Nothing outstanding.
Muskie Capital Cream Ale;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Muskie Capital Brewery;This is their spotted cow clone beer. Very smooth and easy drinking, slightly sweet. Not bad at all.
Muskie Capital Cream Ale;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Muskie Capital Brewery;On tap. Pours a slightly cloudy pale straw-yellow with virtually no head. Tart, slightly fermented vegetal aroma – not very promising. Notably tart flavor too but mercifully without the “fermented” aspect – influence of the wheat perhaps? Has the adjuncty flavor appropriate to a cream ale but without the creamy sweetness of a cream ale. A pleasantly tingly palate, especially considering how flat it looks. It finishes better than it starts and it’s actually a decent tasting beer, but a very odd example of a cream ale.
Muskie Capital Cream Ale;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Muskie Capital Brewery;Fresh, on tap at the brewpub in Hayward, Wisconsin, pours a clear, pale golden yellow brew with a fast dissolving white head. Leaves behind spotty lacing. Aroma is fruity with distinct scents of apple and pears. Taste is smooth, buttery and lightly carbonated. Finish is clean cut and crisp with a slight sweet aftertaste.
Muskie Capital Cream Ale;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Cream Ale;Muskie Capital Brewery;Watery nose on this pale yellow beer. Minimal head. Lager taste with some apple flavor and hint of hops. Every brew at this place had an apple overtone to it. On tap at Muskie Capital.

South Shore Coffee Mint Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;Sample at Great Taste of the Midwest on 08/09/2014: Inky black color with a medium thin light beige head that recedes quickly to a film. Short strings of lacing. Aroma of chocolate, coffee and mint. Medium body with flavors of mint chocolate, malt and mild coffee. Barrel aging is very subtle. The finish is sweet with cocoa and slight bourbon aftertaste. Decent overall.

South Shore Coffee Mint Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;(Backlog) Bottle at fantasy tasting at Paul’s. Black pour with tan head. Barely any mint, roasted, chocolate, bourbon whisky tones fill out this stout.
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;Bottle: Thanks, Jeff! Extremely black body, dark beige head lasting as a thin film most of the way down. Aroma has heavy mint, coffee grounds, chocolate malt, light roast... no real indication of bourbon barrel aging on the nose. Taste is also heavy mint, with a mild menthol-like quality... Notes of chocolate, borderline York Peppermint Patty, some tobacco notes in the back-end, roasted malt, burnt coffee grounds, & a mild plum sweetness. There’s a raw whiskey tone that grows heavier with warmth & makes this harder to drink, as the finish gets quite abrasive. Starts off good, but gets a little too harsh & cumbersome fairly quickly. Had promise but kind of fell flat.
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;Aged about a year. Pours dark brown to black. Small brown head that dissipates to a fair soapy lasting beige topping. Interesting and unique aroma. Someone said mint chocolate ice cream and that’s right there. Theres some smooth bourbon there as well. I think the age has helped take some edge off. Flavor is much the same but much less substantial. Body is a bit light, thin. Finish is sorta tangy, light roasty with some mint. A good beer but does not compare to the big boys.
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;Aged for about a year. Smells like candy. Chocolate mint candies, andies candies or mint chocolate ice cream! Malt, a little bourbon. Taste is similar, but a little light, a little lacking in my opinion. Nice minty aftertaste though, just a little dry and thin.
South Shore Coffee Mint Stout (Bourbon Barrel);Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;22oz bottle shared by Dallas Black with a small tan head and some lacing. Aroma of mints, chocolate and roasted malts. Flavors of dark malts, mint chocolate and woody Decent.

Ginga Kogen German Premium Beer Cool & Crush;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Just found this beer today in the Hacinohe City market. Something new from Ginga, I have high hopes! (Can-198 Yen) Clear medium Golden color with a big-bubbled but quickly fading head. Spritzy looking, loads of bubbles. Mildly sweet malts, Grass, Black Pepper and soap in the nose. Oily feel, the spritz stays in the glass, Has a slight bitter front, a touch of sweet malts with Chardonnay flavors in the middle, bitter follow. A bit sticky after. Not what I expected from this company. Better than the average Japanese A/K/S/S macro but not on par with their other brews.
Asahi 111;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Asahi Breweries;Better than many of the other Asian light lagers, but still a typical Asian lager. Fizzy, not much flavor and well, I’m just rating it to have it logged as one that I’ve had :)

Nethergate Old Chap;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;Golden amber and delicious. if you’re looking for a pub i suggest you go to the bulls head in burslem. They know how to treat beer. Fairly easy to quaff. A fine ale.
Nethergate Old Chap;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;Cask Stillage at Ye Olde Vic, Stockport 16/07/2005 Golden amber coloured with some sour fruit flavour. Slightly dry malt finish.
Nethergate Old Chap;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;Cask (handpump) at the Ivy House, Holborn, London, July 2005. Visited this place on a mini crawl with SilkTork after he had seen a positive recommendation in the CAMRA Bloomsbury and Holborn pub guide, which said it stocked interesting beers for the area. Well this certainly was a rare find but whether it was interesting or not was difficult o tell due to the appalling condition it was served in. From what I could tell, it was a vaguely golden coloured bitter. But it was flat, lifeless and vinegary. Judging by the fact that, as far as I could see, we were the only people in the bar that were drinking cask ale, this beer could have been on for weeks longer than it should have been. On the plus side, I did manage to finish my half - just. Maybe I’m being unfair to the brewery but, if they sell their beer to people who don’t know how to keep it, consequences will follow. Will re-rate if I get the chance.
RCH Tender Loving Care (TLC);Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;RCH;Bottle. A bit lively upon opening.Soon calmed down. Slightly cloudy with some bitterness although not a lot Trace of hops as well. Pleasant session bitter.
RCH Tender Loving Care (TLC);Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;RCH;Cask-conditioned at The Castle, London EC4 11/1/08. A decent amber bitter with a sweet malt and hay aroma, followed by fruity flavours and a grassy hop finish. Good.
RCH Tender Loving Care (TLC);Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;RCH;Cask gravity at Rare Breeds BF 2007. Copper, lasting bubbly off white head. Decent standard bitter. Fairly fruity malt aroma. Tasty, good hop finish. Excellent standard bitter.
RCH Tender Loving Care (TLC);Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;RCH;Cask conditioned @ Guide Dog, Soton. Brown sugary and malt. A bit bland initially and than a decent bitter finish.
RCH Tender Loving Care (TLC);Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;RCH;Cask Handpump at the Crescent, Salford 27/02/2004 Amber golden coloured with fruity and hoppy aromas. Bitter slightly wheaty flavoured finish.
RCH Tender Loving Care (TLC);Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;RCH;Bottle conditioned. Clear amber coloured with a slim white head. Aroma is citrus and other fruits and background malt. Quite a fruity, acidic and hoppy taste. Medium bodied, quite clean and crisp and thirst quenching. Pretty good.
RCH Tender Loving Care (TLC);Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;RCH;500ml bottle (bottle conditioned) from Richs Cider Farm Shop, July 2005. Although it wasn’t a gusher, this beer was clearly over-primed. It poured with a massive off-white head that wouldn’t disperse and sat like a Mr Whippy ice cream above the top of the glass. Even with a very careful pour I was only able to get about a third beer into the glass. Impossible to get any aroma through that. It looks to be a copper coloured beer, but all the gassy activity had churned it up into a murky soup. In the end I was forced to resort to scooping the froth off to be able to drink it at all. When I did manage to taste the beer it was rather thin and a bit lemony but had too much of a sour, acidic edge. I’ve enjoyed a number of bottle conditioned RCH beers but something went horribly wrong with the bottling on this one. I’ll give it a another go if I get the chance.
Upstream Blueberry Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Upstream Brewing Company;Light golden and slightly hazy. Nice rocky head. Neat and active. Absolutely no aroma. Musty character like a fruit rind, but no fruity flavors. People who are looking for a berry-flavored drink will be disappointed.
Hakusekikan Golden Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Bottle. This one is a contract beer for Hakurei Shuzo (Kyoto-fu), labeled as Amanohashidate Beer Golden Ale. Stale, candy, chemical sweetness. Cloudy , sick-looking, yellowish color. Very light, sweet and almost no evident hopping. Slight carbonation tingle. Unpleasant sweetish aftertaste. Light, sticky body. Really unpalatable stuff. Drain pour. Hakusekikan should be ashamed to have their name on this one.
Hakusekikan Golden Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Bottled. Clear golden, rich airy head. Generous grassy nose. Dry and slim with soft, rounded mouthfeel. Bready and grassy, pilsnerish and refreshing with a resh hoppiness and good bitterness.
Hakusekikan Golden Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;"Medium golden color, medium head. Aroma: lemon and citrus, strong hops, very fruity. Flavor: very hoppy, with Citrus and other fruits; lots of lemon. Medium malt but good. Dry overall. Spicy and citrus bigtime. Great hops. Finish: big hops and citrus, sour, light and dry. Great. Very refreshing and light, with decent malt and great hop and fruit. Light body, medium plus carbonation."
Hakusekikan Golden Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;My Bottom Line: A floral and citrusy hop perfume leans towards a wooden character once it hits the tastebuds, as all is balanced by straw-like crisp pale maltiness. Not quite a Belgian Ale or an English Golden Ale, but it’s a Hakusekikan, and that should be reason enough to try it. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam circles the golden gown. -The large bubbling remains peaceful and doesn’t hinder drinkability. -The fun finish is wooden and leafy (Fuggles, I’m told). -The lean body proffers some cracking hay. -All flavors are balanced and aim at drinkability. -Aroma hops are Styrian Goldings, a hop the brewer seems to really like! Bottle and sample from fermenter at the brewery.
Hakusekikan Golden Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Golden color with apples, pears and a mildly syrupy nose. Smooth mouth, a bit unbalanced with apples and pears coming out somewhat. Dry lackluster, boring finish.
Hakusekikan Golden Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;"Tap. Bright golden, slightly bubbly, small head. Very crisp, some sweet maltiness and some well-defined Saaz hops. I liked this a lot on the first sip, but as it warmed one sees that it is a bit unbalanced toward the sugary side. Still not a bad beer, particularly for something with the word ""golden"" in the name."
Hakusekikan Autumn Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Liquid Autumn color. No head, hoppy grapefruit nose (is this really a marzen??). Hoppy start, then a bit sour, then bready malts come in, but this is an unbalanced beer. Like Ace of Hearts says, not one of their better offerings.
Hakusekikan Autumn Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Tap. Dull orange, small head. Crisp, a bit sweetness-unbalanced as the golden ale. Pears, malt, needs more strength/alcohol. Sticky mouthfeel, not as good as other Hakusekikan brews.
Hakusekikan Dunkel;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Light mahogany color, chocolate, vanilla, cherry, brandy and a touch of yeast cross the nose. Light bodied, with milk chocolate, hazelnuts, caramel and oranges. Refreshing milk chocolatey finish with a touch of nuttiness. A little off balance, but great complexity more than make up for it.
Hakusekikan Dunkel;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Tap. Brown with hints of orange, small head. Very strong malts, some chocolate in there. If you’re really picky, it’s off balance, but I’ll take this as a session beer any day. Some bananas and wheat. Sweet, hints of heast that made it interesting. I love a good dunkel and this one is no exception.
Hakusekikan Shizen Bakushu (Lambic);Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;"Bottle from mrmiles. Sat in my cellar for a while and then in a friends fridge for the last year. Label says ""wild yeast ale"" so that is how ill review it. Aroma started off just like a berliner, but as it warmed up there was a strong honey like sweetness. Taste isn’t very intese but has a delicate complexity. Grain, apple tart, honey, earthy. It isn’t anything paryicularly exciting, but its hard to find fault."
Hakusekikan Shizen Bakushu (Lambic);Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Bottle shared by STLWill- thanks, Will, for sharing this oddity. Pours a hazy gold color with a small white head. Aroma immediately gives off a big skunky note, with grass, sweet malts, and bready funk. The flavor had some skunk but not as much, bready and pale malts, apple, lemon, and sugar. Light-medium bodied, with medium carbonation and a tart, bready, skunky, dry mouthfeel. Like a skunked green bottle lager with a shot of lemon juice in it.
Hakusekikan Shizen Bakushu (Lambic);Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;The pour is a hazy golden/yellow color with a tall white head. Smells really, really funky. Rice, anise, lots of barnyard, and tons of yeast. Sort of a sake like aroma to it. A bit of citrus and bread, too. Light lactic tartness on the back end. The flavor is similarly interesting. Intense funk of yeast and bacteria. Sake, rice, light mildew, and barnyard. Definite anise, some malt, citrus peel, and lemon. I actually thought this was pretty good.
Hakusekikan Shizen Bakushu (Lambic);Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Creamed corn nose. Fizzy, cloudy, pale yellow. Flavor is lemon, but heavily dominated by cream corn. Lambic? Wild ale? I say, infected ale.
Hakusekikan Shizen Bakushu (Lambic);Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;"Pours like fizzy yellow beer except that it has a slight yet mysterious gray haze to it. The head was white..shrank pretty fast but started out fairly tall. Nose combined things like lager yeast and sour grapes as well as some hefeweizen-like smells in background. Flavors were somewhat redeeming though I think...very light and lagery but with a soft tartness making it considerably more refreshing than it would have been otherwise. Body is pretty light..in fact, it’s kind of like a bottom fermented semi-wild lager.. I don’t see an ale yeast producing this...but what do I know, it says ""Wild Yeast Ale"" on the bottle. The carbonation here is also quite fierce and abundant. Now, if this 12oz bottle wasn’t $6.40, I could see this as an interesting session beer on a hot summer day...but $6.40 for a 12oz bottle of this is kind of retarded. In any event, tastes like a decent and clean japanese lager with a touch of tartness."
Hakusekikan Shizen Bakushu (Lambic);Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Bottle pours gold with a white head. Aroma is yeasty with a touch of tart citrus and wheat. Flavor shows the same with additional notes of apple, apricot and a touch of funk. Thin and somewhat tart.
Hakusekikan Shizen Bakushu (Lambic);Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Yellow pour, light white head. Aroma is yeasty, fruity, barely any hint of sourness. Flavor is yeasty, lightly tart, light manure...interesting.
Hakusekikan Shizen Bakushu (Lambic);Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Pours a cloudy yellow color with a creamy white head. Pleasant aroma of wild yeast, wheat and citrus. Good flavor of citrus, wheat and wild yeast. The body is light with a creamy texture and soft carbonation. Interesting, more brewers should experiment by including wild yeast in a witbier.

The beer pours a murky light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is wheat with some light tartness. The flavor is tart with sour lemons and sour wheat notes.

Old Market Raspberry Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout;Old Market Pub and Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Pours dark brown with a tall khaki head. The raspberry was very sweet, overtook everything about this stout. Overall the stout was smooth with a creamy palate, light body, mild roastiness. Reminds me of the raspberry stout from Tucks, just sweeter.
Old Market Raspberry Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout;Old Market Pub and Brewery;Tap. Black colored with a fair brown head and some lacing. Nice raspberry aroma spiked with a moderate roasted malt aroma. Medium bodied, bordering on light on the palate. A bit chalky and dusty. Flavor of raspberry and roasted malt. Just doesn’t seem to come together.

Black Forest Brau Keller Irish Red;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Black Forest Brau Keller;On draft at brewery. Poured a light copper color with thin off white head. Really light aroma of maybe malt. Too light to tell for sure. Pretty nice caramel maltiness mixed with a hint of hops and slight tart roasted malt.
Black Forest Brau Keller Irish Red;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Black Forest Brau Keller;This draft brew from the brew pub poured a medium sized head of foamy finely sized bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a softly carbonated light red brown colored body and a good lacing. The weak aroma was malty. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The nice flavor contained notes of malt hops and caramel. A decent one that I would consider buying again. I liked that caramel malt hop flavor.
Black Forest Brau Keller Irish Red;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Black Forest Brau Keller;Sample at the brewpub: Rich reddish-amber color with a medium creamy beige head. Sticky sheets of lacing. The aroma is somewhat malty with a bit of fruit. Medium-bodied with sweet malt and a touch of hops. The finish is sweet caramel and malt with a light bitter aftertaste. Decent session ale.
Black Forest Brau Keller Irish Red;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Black Forest Brau Keller;Draft at Black Forest Brau Keller in Frankenmuth, MI. Medium sized ivory head with a fair quantity of lacing, transparent, minimal carbonation, and a golden orange hue. Nose was all malt. Flavor was malty and a hint of caramel. Smooth mouthfeel. Light body. Weak nose for this style IMO.

Decent white head forms and fades leaving no lacing. Rich malty aroma with perhaps some light floral hops. Medium bodied. Caramel malt seems to dominate flavor. Decent.
Forstner Chilli Beer;Kalsdorf, Austria;Flavored - Other;Handbrauerei Forstner;Draught at the brewpub. Hazy golden coloured, lively carbonation, light chili nose. Starts sweet and after few seconds there’s sharp chili taste. Quite dry. Pleasant (Marko and Maja wouldn’t say that) and long lasting prickly chili aftertaste. Nice beer.
Forstner Chilli Beer;Kalsdorf, Austria;Flavored - Other;Handbrauerei Forstner;Draught at the brewpub, 12°, 4.9%, like all of these shared with ogivlado and Maja. Poured a hazy gold body with a fliffy thick white head that went away slowly. Slightly yoghurty nose with chili. The taste is light, fine, with a green chili pepper taste going into a long prickly aftertaste. I normally don’t like chilli beers but this one manages to avoid being offensive for me and probably the one I liked the most so far.
Forstner Chilli Beer;Kalsdorf, Austria;Flavored - Other;Handbrauerei Forstner;Bottle, Dombrau. Pale clear yellow, smallish white head. Another one of those austrian chili beers, but fortunately it does not come across as extreme by any means, offering gentle green pepper undertones to spice up an otherwise dull and simplistic golden brew. Unfortunately, no excitement comes out of the combination and I can’t think of any reason to order a second one.
Forstner Chilli Beer;Kalsdorf, Austria;Flavored - Other;Handbrauerei Forstner;Frothy head, quickly diminishing. Quite hazy color, dark yellow color. Light sourly/fruity aorma,grainy, then sharpness of chillies. Flavor has first a bit sourness and maltiness (grainy), then it is quite sharp, with notes of chillies and green pepper. Finish has a hoppy dryness and a long present sharpness. Light to medium bodied. Nice chillie beer, a hint to light bodied.

Fantôme Santé-9!;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Fantôme;75 cl bottle purchased from Etre. Shared at Fantomefest 2014. Pours a dark brown color with a fingers worth of white head. Excellent head retention on this. Nose and flavor are relatively bland, they are malty with some bitterness, a touch of dark fruit, and some caramel. No flavor really pops though, it’s more of just an amalgam of flavor. Medium bodied with a drier finish than I anticipated, soft to moderate carbonation. Not good, not bad, just kinda meh. Seeing now that this is 8%, I am surprised how well the alcohol was hidden in it.

Mildura Brewery Desert Sunlight (Sun Light);Mildura, VIC, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Mildura Brewery (BROO Pty Ltd);Pours gold with a sudsy head. Nose shows a fair whack of grassy hops with hints of lemon also showing. Other than that, very little. Flavours include some soft floral hops and a little sweet biscuity malt. Pretty good for a low alcohol beer! Carbonation is very high, a bit annoying actually, although I suppose it’s necessary with light beers.
Mildura Brewery Desert Sunlight (Sun Light);Mildura, VIC, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Mildura Brewery (BROO Pty Ltd);Bottle. Clear light gold body with an average white head.

Pours a deep yellow. I’m actually quite suprised by this beer. For 3% ABV, this beer was as I was expecting. I would like to see a little more bitterness. A good beer for a lighter style lager.
Mildura Brewery Desert Sunlight (Sun Light);Mildura, VIC, Australia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Mildura Brewery (BROO Pty Ltd);Bottle (330ml). Poured pale yellow with a good sized, foamy, white head which was average lasting. Sweet aroma with overwhelming sweet grainy malts, honey, some straw, sweet corn, metallic notes and some wet cardboard (mild). Flavor was also sickly sweet with grainy malts and tons of brewing sugar, a non-existent bitterness, some soda water notes and a subtle fruitiness (lychee). Very light bodied (as the name indicates), with fizzy carbonation (soda like), a quite watery texture and a non-existent bitterness. Not the worse low alcohol beer I have had, but that’s not saying much at all. Would make a good replacement for “tap” water.

Echigo Cierto;Nishikanbara-gun, Niigata-ken, Japan;Flavored - Other;Echigo Beer Company;Can-138 Yen) Green can with Barley stalks framing the name and a sprig of Peppermint leaves. Pale doesn’t begin to describe this, just a touch of yellow this side of clear. No head to speak of. Not much in the aroma department either, I do get a touch of mint but I’m not sure if I would if this was a blind tasting and I wasn’t searching for it. Sweet and bland, once again the touch of mint but same as the aroma, is it really here or an I just expecting it to be? A sticky feel, checking the ingredients, this has Barley listed as only 25% of the bill and Molasses listed as an ingrdient too. No wonder it’s sweet. The mint is a bit more noticeable in the follow, has a popcorn like aftertaste. Not much to my liking but an interesting spin on a Herbal brew.

Blue Cat Howling Man Imperial Pale Ale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Draft taster at Blue Cat, notes from August. Bright copper color with a thin APA head. Bah, my nose is not helping, as the brewhouse is permeated with the scent of yeast today. So the taste, though, is malty and thick, with just a bit of pine resin in the back. Nice enough, but as I’m allowing myself a full pint after all the samples I’ve had, I’m going back for the Black Zemon.
Blue Cat Howling Man Imperial Pale Ale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Draft at Blue Cat Brew Pub.

Mellow alcohol notes.
Blue Cat Howling Man Imperial Pale Ale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Blue Cat Brew Pub;On Tap. Ominous dirty orange pour, lasting carbonation and a nice aroma of sweet hops. Flavor was sweet syrupy hops, not much bitterness to speak of and finished slick and warming. Not my idea of a DIPA in any sense of the style. I hope they dial up some of the bitterness in the next recipe.
Blue Cat Howling Man Imperial Pale Ale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a murky dark orange-brown color. The head was thin, off white, and didn’t leave any lace behind. Smelled of distinct grape candy, dish water, and subdued dark toffee. There was also a whiff of hay. Medium bodied and slightly sweet up front with mild to moderate bitterness that increased somewhat toward the end and lingered after the finish. Carbonation was on the low end of the spectrum. Tasted of grape candy, pale malt, and earthy/grassy Euro hops. There was also some harsh alcohol. Reminded me more of an imperial pilsner than an imperial IPA.
Blue Cat Howling Man Imperial Pale Ale;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Had on tap on the brewpub in a snifter. I had high hopes for this beer and landed in disappointment. It’s labeled as an Imperial Pale Ale, and their site has it listed as an Impy IPA, but it’s not nearly hoppy enough either way. The flavor was very sweet and malty with just a hint of citrus hops, but not nearly enough flavor or bitterness for the style.

Prairie Rock Triple Nickel Irish Stout;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Stout - Dry;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;I understand Guiness isn’t THE top Stout out there - but that’s what I’m comparing it against. And it doesn’t compare. Beautiful color, Nitrogen cascades as it settles - but the taste and mouthfeel are missing. Very thin for this type of beer, almost no head at all, kind of guiness light. On it’s plus side, I think It’s got a higher alochol content.

Hummel-Bräu Weizen-Bock;Memmelsdorf-Merkendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei Hummel Merkendorf;Huge thanks to kevnic2008 for that one! Bottle looks simple but really good. Beer in the glass zippy, nice creamy head. Intense yeasty aroma. Starts strong, intense malty-yeasty, fine fruity notes of apricot and peaches. More and more dry, but still okay. Yeasty-fruity finish. The alcohol is well hidden. Nice!
Hummel-Bräu Weizen-Bock;Memmelsdorf-Merkendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei Hummel Merkendorf;Bottle. Hazy Orange Gold with a thick White head. Inviting banana and bubblegum aroma. Flavour has a lot of yeast to it and plenty more banana weizen notes. The alcohol is quite prominent. I’m becoming a real fan of this style. Light hearted like a Hefe but much more serious in ABV.

Hummel-Bräu Weizen-Bock;Memmelsdorf-Merkendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei Hummel Merkendorf;Rated at Hummel in Nov 2011. Head is mostly lasting. Body is cloudy medium to dark yellow. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain), with notes of musty old people, socks, light note of banana. Flavor is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Phew. Not an attractive odor. Smelled like an old folks’ home more than anything else, which is a weird smell for any beer. Just really clunky all around.

Gordon Biersch Rauchbier;San Jose, California, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);draft, an adjuncty smoky brown lager. It’s aight, nothing really wrong, just some grainy smoky mess of light flavors. Meh.
Gordon Biersch Rauchbier;San Jose, California, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Caramel-tinted amber body which held a head for a while and retained carbonation thoroughly. Smokiness is rather subdued in the aroma behind the standard roasted maltiness. I’m not sure how I feel about the flavor. Mild sweetness, tea bitters and only a mild smokiness which comes off as artificial. Effervescence and alcohol tingle the lips while the beer finishes dry. Bah. Maybe I’m just spoiled on Schlenkerla. ~~~~~~~~~ Draught, GB Bolingbrook, IL.
Gordon Biersch Rauchbier;San Jose, California, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);On tap in Columbus Ohio. Dark brown liquid with a nice foamy head.

Gordon Biersch Rauchbier;San Jose, California, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Lasting foamy off-white head tops the straw-amber shade. Mellow peat character rounds out the otherwise average cerealic and bready malty nose. Restricted hoppiness allow for banana yeastiness to pop up and bring along a slight tartness. Medium body, creamy texture, average balance and unpolished example outside the rauch aspect.

Light orange pour, white head. Slightly smoky aroma. Flavor has some smoked sausage saltiness to it.

Leicht Bräu Lager Ungespundetes;Weismain, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Püls Bräu;Bottle. Slightly nutty and also shows some grassy hop notes in the finish. Nice crisp and bready. Again, enjoyable, if a little bit boring.

Leicht Bräu Lager Ungespundetes;Weismain, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Püls Bräu;Tap Light yeasty notes. No visual clues - in Stein. Light fruity base, lightbodied, sparkly, light herbal exit - Seems they took the Leicht name a bit too serious when they took over from the original Leicht brewery.
Leicht Bräu Lager Ungespundetes;Weismain, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Püls Bräu;"Draught Served in Stein ; no head to speak off. Slightly sweet, malty (very fresh malts) nose, yeast. Sweet, malty taste with some yeast touches as peach or sweet oranges. Fruity finish retronasal. Yeast definitely gives some body, not really light. Nice, but not earthshaking Ungespundetes. Fruity notes are nice."
Schlafly Organic Pale Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;Draft sampler pours Amber with a off white head. Aroma of malts, fruit, citrus and floral notes. Taste is grains, citrus and some fruit.
Schlafly Organic Pale Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;This was shared with Strykzone at the brewpub. I could tell by the look on Dave’s face when he took his first sip that was going to like this better than him. Came in the glass a clear golden color with a white head and very pronounced lacing. Nose of stone fruit with mango, nectarine and peach, Medium body. Resinous mouth feel. Flavor is fruity, with citrus. Flavorful and lightly bitter finish. Excellent.
Schlafly Organic Pale Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;Tap at the Tap Room. Clear gold with a little copper hue. Just a little off white foam. Nsoft fruit and light cracker in the aroma. First sip tells me it is an organic. That is usually a negative and that applies here. Light spices, gentle fruit, yeast, soft tropical fruit notes. This is a nice session beer. Some sourness towards the finish. A bit of zing here.
Schlafly Organic Pale Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;"Sampled on tap at the 2012 Schlafly Hop In The City festival. I expected it to taste just like regular Schlafly Pale Ale--since ""organic"" refers to the way grains and hops are grown and needn’t alter the flavor much--but this was clearly a different recipe altogether. It poured a deep amber color with chill haze, thin head with no lace. Very strong fresh hop aroma definitely in IPA territory. Flavor was also overly hoppy in my opinion, too much bitterness against a weak non-descript malt sweetness. Thick-bodied vegetal soup impression. I wanted to like this, St. Peters Organic English Ale is one of my favorite beers, for instance. Sadly, this beer wasn’t nearly as caramelly, balanced, smooth, or easy-drinking even as Schlafly’s flagship Pale Ale."
Schlafly Organic Pale Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;Draft. Clear amber body, beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, earthy, some caramel, melon. Taste is moderately sweet, honey, melon, some strawberry, orange, kiwi. Medium body, some stickiness.
Schlafly Organic Pale Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;Clear and copper, very pretty color in the glass. Head and lacing were ok. Smells and tastes friggin’ hoppy! The bartender told me this is a new version, and is made with Galaxy hops from New Zealand and Tasmania (probably amongst other stuff, lol). Very tasty! Malt balance is good, it’s a very balanced and tasty pale ale that’s a bit darker than most pale ales, but is crystal clear. Extremely tasty and easy to drink. Body is light but just a tad chewy and oh so amazingly hoppy on the finish! It’s very hard to believe they crammed so much hops into this low ABV, low IBU beer. Bravo! This is way better than their usual pale ale, although appearance wise it’s probably a clone recipe for at least the base malts. However, they’ve certainly changed it up for this beer. It’s an amazing must-try. Serving type: on-tap
Schlafly Organic Pale Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;Enjoyed on-tap @ the Schlafly Tap Room in St. Louis, MO for $4.50 Tapped from the Stainless Steel/Black Tap Handle into a 16oz Nonic Glass. This beer brewed for this past (2012) Earth Day. Aroma- Very distinct Columbus hops upfront and very appropriate use of them. Malt is well balanced in the aroma and has a definite sweet finish. Appearance- Received with a 1 finger head that has average retention. Has a medium orange, light copper colored body with great clarity. Leaves a thick strand of lacing behind. Flavor- Malty and clean with well blended hops. Not sure the variety but Columbus comes around again. May have centennial or galaxy? Light Bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel- Medium Bodied, Medium-High Carbonation, Smooth, and has a sweet finish with tons of malt lasting character left on the palate. Overall Impression- Since it came out, I’ve been enjoying both from friend’s Growlers and on-tap multiple times! This guy is a must try if you find yourself at either Schlafly location. Very clean and true to style. Enjoy!
Schlafly Organic Pale Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;Draft sample at Hop in the City 2010. Pours a clear orange-amber color with a small off-white head. Aroma of grassy hops, pale malts, apples, grapes, herbs, and straw. Flavor of grassy hops, earth, pale malts, overripe fruits, and straw. Light-bodied, with mellow carbonation and a mouthfeel that is both earthy and mineral. Nothing special, but I’d actually take this over the flagship Pale Ale, I think.
Schlafly Organic Pale Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap at Hop in the City 2010. Pours copper / orange with a small beige head. The aroma has bread, light toast to the malt and slightly sour fruit. Medium / light body with a light amount of sharp carbonation. The taste is much of the same as the aroma with some metallicness and an English slant to the malt. The finish is a bit sour and medicinal. Fair at best.
Schlafly Organic Pale Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Saint Louis Brewery;Tried this from the cask at the Taproom. Arrived a deep brown, red color with a thin filmy head. Aroma has a strong columbus citrus orange with a mild toasted caramel malt and a smooth sweetness. Flavor has a strong woody front, slightly watered down toasted malt note, light orange citrus, a coffee-like astringency (not the bitterness) and a light grassy flavor. Body is very light, zero carbonation and a slight watered down texture.
John Harvards Manchester Mad PIPA;Manchester, Connecticut, United States;IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Manchester;Draft at Manchester, CT location. Piney, earthy aroma with lots of PNW hops present.

Lots of sweetness in the mouth but dries out enough in the finish to bring it more into dry territory. Superbly juicy. Lip smacking in fact. A little too sweet but damn good all round.

Burrow Hill Cider - Medium Dry (Draught);Martock, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Burrow Hill Cider;Barrel, GBBF 2005: Sweet aroma. Very soft and sweet in the mouth. A great thirst quencher. Well-matured apples used in this cider.
Burrow Hill Cider - Medium Dry (Draught);Martock, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Burrow Hill Cider;From the barrel at GBBF, August 2005. Burrow Hill has put a lot of effort into upmarket bottle conditioned ciders and cider brandy and its products rarely fall into the more rustic cider category. This one certainly has some traditional elements but still has a quite refined feel to it. Distinctly appley aroma, with just a hint of farmyard. A little on the sweet isde for a medium dry cider and there’s quite intense fruit on the palate. There’s just enough tannic grip to prevent it becoming too smooth and mellow. Quite classy stuff.
Castlings Heath Dry Cider;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Apple Cider;Castlings Heath Cider;Polypin in the Sweffling White Horse, Suffolk. As Castlings Heath Cottage Organic Cider. Slightly hazy yellow with a couple of suds around the edges. sour honey in the aroma. The taste is very sour and sharp with almost more lemon juice flavour than apple.

Clear but pleasant alcohol too. Massive white rum notes in the flavour, surely this has been in a cask of some sort although it doesn’t say. Immensely dry lambic like sourness. Loooooong rum finish. Easy to drink considering the abv is almost 8% and the dryness just makes me want more and more of it. No wonder cider heads are nutters.
Castlings Heath Dry Cider;Sudbury, Suffolk, England;Apple Cider;Castlings Heath Cider;GBBF2008. Yellowish golden colour, no head. Aroma is glue, some nectar, rotten apples and quite stingy. Flavour is glue, apples, some alcohol and overall quite sweetish sour. Very dry palate.

Gwynt y Ddraig Haymaker (Draught);Pontypridd, Wales;Apple Cider;Gwynt y Ddraig Cider;Served still from the cellar at the Bell, Wendens Ambo. Deep mid- to dark gold with a tint of orange. Clear, flat and - dare I say it - slightly shiny. The aroma is light and, while pleasant, is distinctly un-appley. Cherry candy, along with pear (OK another orchard fruit so close) and a hint of bubblegum. Full taste but too sweet for me. A hint of apple skin bitter in the finish, but the sweetness remains slightly sickly. It does however leave an enticing tartness on the lips. Not an ideal cider but certainly enjoyable. Doesn’t taste anywhere near its strength.
Gwynt y Ddraig Haymaker (Draught);Pontypridd, Wales;Apple Cider;Gwynt y Ddraig Cider;Apr 2015 - Cask at JDW. Hazy orange, still, small bubbly white head.

Alas, (and it’s a personal thing), far too sweet for my taste. Too sweet and sticky to be refreshing, which is what I was looking for. Could be a good winter drink with roast pork.
Gwynt y Ddraig Haymaker (Draught);Pontypridd, Wales;Apple Cider;Gwynt y Ddraig Cider;Cask. Clear copper. Fresh picked reddish apples on nose, really nice. A bit of zest/seeds there also.

Great cider, one of GyD’s best clear ones.

Shamrock Irish Porter;Pueblo, Colorado, United States;Porter;Shamrock Brewing Co.;"Deep and dark brown with a tan head. Nose was vibrantly alcoholic and a little chocolaty. Notes of dark toast, bitter chocolate, sweet smoke, and bacon. At first I thought the beer was pretty good, and I didn’t mind the ""nips"" of alcohol. But then the fusel alcohol flavs/aromas started pushing to the forefront of my attention. Once the rubbing alcohol off-flavor took hold, I couldn’t escape it. Probably -- hopefully -- just a bad batch I caught."

Shamrock Belgian White;Pueblo, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Shamrock Brewing Co.;2005: Hazy and pale yellow frothy white head. Smooth texture with a nice carbonation level. Pleasant nips of lemon and bitter orange, and the perfect amount of background spices (such as the evident coriander, but also curious aromas of clove and orange peel). Sweetness and bitterness levels were very balanced and complementing. 2008: Foggy pale yellow thin head nice lace. Light body spritzy carbonation mostly refreshing, albeit a bit cloying in the finish. Cobwebby malts (bread dough, honey). Pleasant aromas (flowers, bananas, yeast esters). Light spices in the background (white pepper, coriander). OK beer, but far from pushing the envelope.

Rock Bottom San Diego ESB #42;San Diego, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rock Bottom San Diego;Draught sample. Given the numeric designation and generic looking tap label, I think this was an experiment that the brewmaster decided was good enough to put on tap. It pours a slightly hazy orange-amber, and has a nicely hopped nose. Mouthfeel is soft and fresh. Flavour has some tart hops with caramel malt in the background - simple, but well executed. It does feel a bit reined in, though, as if it hadn’t quite reached it’s full potential. Maybe batch #43 will be better...
O'Brien Pale Ale;Ballarat, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;O'Brien Brewing;I really enjoyed the o’briens Lager. Yet to try the pale ale. Great packaging, and for a gluten free lager the taste is brilliant.

O'Brien Pale Ale;Ballarat, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;O'Brien Brewing;This is as bad a beer as I’ve had for a very long time. Who knew gluten free was synonymous with rancid pish.
O'Brien Pale Ale;Ballarat, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;O'Brien Brewing;Great Gluten Free Beer. Light to medium body with an initial hit of fizz and no real identifiable hops. Good bitterness for an alternate grain blend. Doesn?t compare to depth and multilayered flavours of other non-GF beers.
O'Brien Pale Ale;Ballarat, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;O'Brien Brewing;330ml bottle. Amber colour, white foam head and hoppy aroma. Taste is grainy, sourgham, fruity, with some spicy earthy bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied, medium carbonation, dry tangy bitter finish. Quite OK.
Wild Blue;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);The best beer I have ever had. Good first flavor. Nice color. Fantastic aftertaste. Can’t find it anymore. Alas, you find a great beer, then it disappears. :~{

Girls absolutely love it. It’s like alcoholic blueberry juice that’s super sweet. Highly fucking recommended.
Wild Blue;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Best beer ive ever had. Im not a big drinker but beer is my thing. I loved sitting down with a Wild Blue in a pretty glass because the color is amazing as is the taste! Now i cant get it in Tx., Branson, Mo or northern Wisconsin. Such a dissapointment for me!! Theres not another one that compares!
Wild Blue;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Love this strong, delicious beer! Definitely my favorite. It's fruity, but doesn't have that weak wine cooler or cheer beer type taste.
Wild Blue;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Love love love this beer want some more of it! Beer is a blueberry color that gets better with each sip. The 8% lets you sip and tip without too much effort! Hahaha Great for any occasion. Give it a try and you will see wha I mean less beer drinking equals less trips to the ladies room equals more time to enjoy whatever ales ya! Highly recommended. Anheiser bushs best kept secret weapon.....
Wild Blue;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"12oz bottle; pours watery, little foam that's more off a purple/white and dissipates fast. On the nose an artificial blueberry, and a little boozyness. First impressions, as far as taste goes it's really got nothing going on as far as natural or surprising flavors, mostly an artificial overly boozy cough syrup."
Wild Blue;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Before i tried this i had the Sweet Water Blue which sometimes you could order had real blueberries depending on place you went in sevierville.Me and my old man had went to New York and i had found this beer in a store there.We picked it up and tried it...some of the best beer i ever had.I fell in love with it.Great taste,super smooth and taste like fruit.It since has become my favorite beverage to drink.Wish more places in Sevierville,TN servered this product.I feel would be a great ladies choice.
Wild Blue;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I love this beer! I think this is probably my favorite beer ever. I’m not a major beer drinker, but I’ve come to really enjoy dark beers, especially ambers, over the last few years and often drink a beer with dinner most nights. I also LOVE blueberries (and have loved them since I was little). In my opinion, this beer combines the best possible flavors of beer - a bit of bitterness and earthiness, a little rich and carbonated - with the right mix of blueberry flavor - not quite overdoing the blueberry, but certainly noticeable. It makes it a bit sweet too, to counterbalance the blueberry flavor, but certainly not overly sweet like a lot of wine coolers and chick beers are - just sweet enough, I think. I also really like that it’s a stronger beer (8%), somehow that really adds to it, in my opinion. If you don’t like blueberry or other fruit flavors in your beer, then I’m sure you won’t like this one. If you like that really classic lager flavor to be the strongest flavor you taste, then you might find the blueberries overpower it here. But if you like a bit of fruity flavor and/or darker stronger beers, then you might really enjoy this one. To me, it’s my favorite. I can drink it with a meal or by itself and it’s always good! roasty, floral, citrus, earthy, woody, red, clear, light sweetness, lightly bitter, lightly sour, medium body, slick feel, lively, bitter,
Wild Blue;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I freaking LOVE this beer. This is not by any means a regular beer. Deep purple with light purple head. Supposed to be blueberry but really grape. Very refreshing and easy drinking. Careful, will sneak up on you. 8% alcohol is no lie. Come to think of it, believe I’ll open up one now.
Wild Blue;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Bottle from Publix Supermarket, Lexington, South Carolina. Purple-red with next to no head. Berry fruity sweet with blueberry and cherry prevalent. Rich to the extent you can’t feel its strength, although you can just about tell this in its nose.

Dundee India Pale Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;IPA;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"This beer has potential, but is just lacking about one point in each category. Aroma is barely there, except some light pine/citrus...which is decent. Light orange-red appearance..thin and light but frothy white head....slightly above average at best. Mouthfeel is good...smooth and mildly carbed....probably the best thing about this brew. Feels and tastes more like an APA, but hey..it is what it is! Well balanced, but not much hops for an ""IPA"". Worth the price I guess, but there are so many better ones out there."

Double Vision Cider - Medium (Draught);Boughton Monchelsea, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Double Vision Cider;[i]Cask at Merton Summer Beer Festival 06-07-07[/i]. This was the first of the ale’s, ciders and perries to run out, hugely popular amongs the ciderheads but then it was also the strongest. Poured pale yellow with overripe appley aroma, tasted quite fruity and potent! Apples were there but like others mention there was a definate pearness to this cider, I actually didn’t mind this at all and am suprised by the low ratings although I will hasten to add it was far from the best cider and perry on offer.

Double Vision Cider - Medium (Draught);Boughton Monchelsea, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Double Vision Cider;From the barrel at GBBF, August 2005. Pale soft straw colour. In fact, apart form the slight acidity noted by tiggmtl, this is quite a soft cider in general. Kentish, so probably not made with traditional cider apple varieties which probably has something to do with it. Quaffable, but short of grip.
Double Vision Cider - Medium (Draught);Boughton Monchelsea, Kent, England;Apple Cider;Double Vision Cider;Strong acetic aroma brings to mind apple cider vinegar. Cloudy white-yellow body is still. Somewhat chalky flavour and texture with very strong vinegar-like acidity. Coats the teeth. Not a favourite. Sampled from the barrel at GBBF 2005.

Crone's Special Reserve Cider (Draught);Norwich, Norfolk, England;Apple Cider;Crone's Organic Cider;From the barrel at GBBF, August 2005. Big funky farmyard aroma, with some eggy sulphur in evidence. That suggests something very traditional in style, but its much softer on the palate, with some residual sweetness. Could do with a bit more backbone. As this is a Norfolk cider, I suspect extensive use of dessert apples and extended barrel age which has mellowed it out just a touch too much for my taste.
Crone's Special Reserve Cider (Draught);Norwich, Norfolk, England;Apple Cider;Crone's Organic Cider;Minty, herbal, woody, apple aroma with a strong barnyard character. Hazy deep golden body.

Naish Medium Dry Cider;Glastonbury, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Naish Cider;[From a barrel at GBBF 2005] A hazy orange beer with no head. The aroma is sweet apply, but also with some notes of straw. The flavor is of apples and yeast, and it has a dry end.
Naish Medium Dry Cider;Glastonbury, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Naish Cider;Barrel, GBBF 2005: Golden coloured. Very dry cider. Not much apple in this. Not much fruits, no citrus. Some nuts?.
Naish Medium Dry Cider;Glastonbury, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Naish Cider;From the barrel at GBBF, August 2005. Hazy amber colour. Mildly cheesy aroma. Very woody on the palate, with some sweetness that didn’t integrate perfectly. The octogenarian Naish brothers (one of whom has sadly died recently) generally make very traditional ciders, but this isn’t one of their most assertive offerings. Still a decent drop.
Naish Medium Dry Cider;Glastonbury, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Naish Cider;Nutty, alcoholic, tropical fruit and apples in the aroma. Hazy browned apple-juice like appearance. Barnyard character is strong in the dry, woody, lightly botter apple flavour. Medium body is quite dry and wine-like. Enjoyable. Sampled from the barrel at GBBF 2005.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Black Bull Imperial Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;Draught at the brewpub. Opaque black color with attractive khaki head that laced the glass. Rich aroma of anise, vanilla, alcohol, and milk chocolate. Tasted of sweet chocolatey malt, soy sauce, and alcohol. They soy note was a bit strong, but didn’t detract much.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Black Bull Imperial Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;Silk black pour with a small lid of dark tan bubbles. Dark fruit aroma with, caramel, and light alcohol. Smooth and thick on the palate. Lots of stewed fruit aromas. Light chocolate and coffee in the finish and linger. A decent winter warmer.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Black Bull Imperial Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;"Wasn’t too impressed with this one. Pour looked very nice.. deep brown with a 1/2"" caramel head and nice lacing. Head almost completely receded after a minute or so. Aroma picked up caramel, sweet chocolate, and alcohol.. but was rather weak. Palate was thin and the flavors didn’t seem to get through to the right taste buds. Flavor had some sweet and dark chocolate + caramel and alcohol.. but was also a bit thin. Caramel came through stronger as it warmed. Alcohol made itself the highlight of all facets of the drink (aroma, flavor, finish), which I didn’t care for too much."
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Black Bull Imperial Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;Milwaukee. Beautiful opaque and black in color with a nice dark creamy tan head. The nose gives a mild expose to Hershey syrup mixed with molasses. Cocoa made with whole milk, mild cigar wrappers and unsweetened dark chocolate bring the aroma full circle. Chocolate roastiness is there for flavor, moving to movements in line with nearly burnt pecans. As it warns, it gets better, but it begs the question: if you brew it, why not go the extra step to serve it right? Moderate mouth feel with velvety smoothness. Dark chocolate manifests on the undertow with a sharp semi-sweet chocolate twang, proceeded with an artificial tasting burp. Alcohol warms the back of the throat and you can feel it in the head (maybe it’s that I started drinking at 11:00 a.m.?) Syrupy, boding sweetness becomes this one in its entirely for the last six ounces. As a commercial comparison, it’s most similar to Weyerbacher Old Heathen and Great Lakes Blackout Stout.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Black Bull Imperial Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;Sampled this in MKE. It pours to a dark black body with a thin tan head and thick dense lacing. The flavor is dark fruits, light charcoal. Light dark chocolate. There’s also light banana and oak cask. A light nuttiness. The aroma is chocolate but is light. Coffee roastiness. The palate is rich, medium-full thickness.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Black Bull Imperial Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;On tap at the Milwaukee location. Their batch is only 9% ABV but seems similar enough to add to this listing. Black body, small tan head. Coffee / chocolate malt aroma with some alcohol. Big sweet roasty flavor. Tart, acidic dark roasted malt (a little like burnt coffee) alongside heavy milk chocolate malt. Good mouthfeel. Acidic, roasty finish. A pretty good RIS, it could use some other flavor elements other than the roast malt.
Severn Vale Vale Ale;Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Severn Vale Brewing Co. (Combined Brewers);Hand pulled from 12 Bells in Cirencester, UK. Poured amber with slight reddish notes and a moderate sized cream colored head. Light hop aroma with a touch of malt. Flavor is mostly watery with some malt and hops poking through but mostly water.

Severn Vale Vale Ale;Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Severn Vale Brewing Co. (Combined Brewers);20 pint polypin from the brewery. A balanced bitter which maintained interest over a period of a week. Decent hops in the aroma and a slightly fruity flavour.

Severn Vale Vale Ale;Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Severn Vale Brewing Co. (Combined Brewers);Cask (gravity dispense) Birmingham CAMRA Festival 2005. A plain brown bitter that has seen better days, the malts still there but so’s a butteryness that kills out any subtley this beer may ave had. Again, as with other bitters at this fest, not bad but probably sufferign from tiredness on the last day.

Aroma: semi-toasty, fresh yeast; aromatic-fruity similar to quince, peaches, apples even to strawberries. Slight Floral-hoppy smells some citric. Flavor: ephemeral semi-toasted malted start.

York Wild Wheat (Wicked Wheat);York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Cask conditioned at The Last Drop, York, as Wicked Wheat. Pale gold with slight haze, white head. Looks like this has had a revamp, light lemony hop, fresh with hop flower notes, thin body but with slight spiciness, really quite pleasant.
York Wild Wheat (Wicked Wheat);York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Pale hazy yellow ale. Timid wheaty nose with nondescript fruitiness. As most of the British wheats I’ve tried, rather timid yeast character with soft esters, but barely any phenols. Light bubblegum character fail to entice. Soft to medium carbonation does reduce the refreshment and leave the ensemble a bit sticky. Still, not bad per se, but room for improvement.
York Wild Wheat (Wicked Wheat);York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Cask (Wenlock Arms, London) Cloudy yellow. Little aroma, a general sense of lightness. Clean mild malty taste. No highlights. Creamy and refreshing, seems sessionable.

Slighty hazy warm yellow, small layer of fine white. Sweet-leaning aroma—pear drop, sweaty citrus. Slightly pepper flavor, a heavy dose of caramel sweetness, but some chalky, tooth-coating bitterness that offers some balance. Doesn’t last though—decidedly too sweet after half a pint.

Biscuity malt aroma. Some dusty hops and a touch of citrus in the flavour. A fairly traditional best bitter tending towards an Autumnal style but it doesn’t really pack much of a punch. Solid but unspectacular.
Titanic M G Y;Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Titanic Brewery (UK);St Albans. Gravity. Slightly rough edge gives some earthy character to an otherwise quite ordinary bitter. But what can you do? You drink ’em, you mark ’em, you move on...

Full Mash Indian Summer;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Mash Brewery;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Oooh quite lagery.

Opaque gold in colour with a thin white head. Sweet pineapple fruit notes present in the short lived aroma. Thin but refreshing mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt base gives a juicy fruit flavour of pineapple and lychees. Dry resiny hops give a strong astringency full in the bitter aftertaste with a flinty residue.

Fort Collins Doppelbock;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Fort Collins Brewery;From Sep 2007 This pours from Growler a clear reddish brown with a huge tannish head of foam that is very long lasting. Near the end of my first glass, there's still a solid layer and it has some nice lacing. Beautiful looking beer in the glass. The smell is of caramel malt with some smoke and chocolate and a bit of vanilla. The taste is malty but not too sweet and has some smoke, dark fruit(fig mostly) some dark chocolate and a touch of vanilla and...this is with my drinking it directly out of the fridge so I'm going to let it warm up some and see what happens. While I'm waiting for it to warm, I have to say at this point, for being 10%abv, it is *very* well hidden. I get just the slightest bit of warming after the swallow and that's it. Pretty impressive. Ok, it's warmed up some now and I get some more smoke(just the right amount, imho) and more malt and more chocolate and overall, this is one fine smooth drinker. I could see myself sipping on it all day long but...I'm going to cap it and save the rest for tomorrow. Bottom line: I liked last year's version but thought the smoke was overpowering the other flavours. This batch, I think, brings out the best in *all* the flavours and for that, FCB, I salute you. I can't wait to try a bottle and see how it compares. I highly recommend you try this DB if you see it in your area!

Fort Collins Doppelbock;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Fort Collins Brewery;"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy dark ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, light chocolate, raisin, fig, date, wood smoke, tobacco, nuttiness, and smoke/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready/smoked malt and yeast fruitiness; with great strength. Taste of huge caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, light chocolate, raisin, fig, date, wood smoke, tobacco, nuttiness, and smoke/toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, light chocolate, nuttiness, raisin, fig, date, wood smoke, tobacco, and smoke/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/smoked malt and yeast fruitiness; with zero cloying sweetness on the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible smoked doppelbock! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/smoked malt and yeast fruitiness; and dangerously smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

Bartrams Suffolk n Strong;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bartrams;Handpull, PoW, Hinckley, 19/04/14. Hardly any halo over pale gold. Nose squashy sultana and thistle. Dank grass, lemon, aniseed, buttery streaks and TCP homebrew notes. Not great.
Bartrams Suffolk n Strong;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bartrams;Dense golden body. If there was a head it was gone by the time it got to the table.

Cask, The State, Glasgow

Bartrams Suffolk n Strong;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bartrams;Cask at Cambridge Blue, Cambridge. Gold with a white head. Barman said, while making a hash of pulling the pint, ’This is my first day. This is so not me.’ I had to agree with him. Hairy malt aroma with hints of chocolate and underarm. Complicated taste with malt, grass and nettles. Sharp bitter finish. Served a little warm. Didn’t much like it, to tell the truth.

Rinkuškiai Žaibo;Biržu raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinkuškiai;Pint + bottle from some rinky dink store in Silver Spring. Pours golden with a dusting of a white head. Aroma is cheap caramel candy, that's it. Flavor is that same cheap caramel candy, some green grass, some green leaf, and more caramel. I'm going to drink it because I'm tired and don't feel like going to the store, but I'm not gonna like it. Pretty unpleasant flavor overall.
Rinkuškiai Žaibo;Biržu raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinkuškiai;Bottle picked up at Jungle Jims along with a couple other bigger ones when the abv cap disappeared from notes. Pours a clear golden color with a small white head that disappeared. The aroma and flavor is mostly sweet malts, almost candied, grass, and some off notes, not very good.
Rinkuškiai Žaibo;Biržu raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinkuškiai;0.5 liter bottle. Pours a hazy orange color, not much head. Aroma is sweet, like caramel or butterscotch. Flavor is also very sweet. A bit cloying and yeasty. Not much hop or malt presence. Palate is thin. Overall it’s not a terrible beer. I’m a bit surprised it’s rated so low.
Rinkuškiai Žaibo;Biržu raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinkuškiai;Very weak, very sweet lager with a slick mouthfeel and an unfortunate aftertaste.
Rinkuškiai Žaibo;Biržu raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinkuškiai;Nice color, golden yellow/brown... with a small amount of floaties. Smells malty candy sweet, almost too sweet for a beer... but a good smell. Quite flat and thin, hard to believe its 9.5%. Tastes like an old ale more than a pils/lager. Its not bad.
Rinkuškiai Žaibo;Biržu raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinkuškiai;Bottle: Pours cloudy, yellow gold with a very thin white head. Orange malt and butterscotch aroma and flavour.... Fruity, syrupy sweet with a pronounced, alcohol bitter. I’m surprised it’s not considered a malt liquor.........
Rinkuškiai Žaibo;Biržu raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinkuškiai;"Deep Amber Color, Small Head, Leaves Almost No Lacing. Sweet Malt Aroma. Sweet, caramel, malt, boozy. Was better than expected or I’ve remembered. Labels have a few things that are lost in translation. I would guess those labels were translated back in early 90’s, when good translators were scars and have not been updated or fixed. Everyone catches on ""stout"" part. It is a far cry from Stout indeed. Second, in English it says Thunder beer, while in reality it has a lightning bolt, which is the correct name. That is the my joke, that one bottle is enough, it hits you like lightning and you pass out...Actually it was not that bad but I would not have more than one..."
Rinkuškiai Žaibo;Biržu raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinkuškiai;"Aroma of sweet butterscotch and perhaps some toast; maybe a minimal hop presence somewhere in the ""noble"" family. Appearance is orangish gold with bubbly white head. Flavor is pretty butterscotch, really kinda like drinking alcoholic butterscotch; finish is a little less sweet, but with some residual alcohol and perfume. Palate is medium, sticky and soft. At once repulsive and alluring; repulsive in that it is a rather poor beer, but alluring in that ""you’re stuck somewhere in Eastern Europe and want to forget the miseries of life"" sort of way."
Rinkuškiai Žaibo;Biržu raj., Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Rinkuškiai;The aroma is very sweet with hay, corn, and paper. The appearance is deep gold with a small head. The taste is like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall pretty much garbage.

Wychwood Battleaxe;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Hand-pulled pint in the excellent ’Loggerheads’ in Shrewsbury on 24 May 2013. Light golden body, almost lager like in fact: good solid white head on top. Earthy, hoppy, with a dry finish. No great aroma, some citrusy hops but little of anything really. The taste was mildly citrus hops with an undertone of wheat and malts which gave the brew a semi-sweet feel before the hops came strong again to give a fairly dry and bitter finish. OK more than great: pleasant more than outstanding.
Wychwood Battleaxe;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cask at the Bridge, Kingswinford. Pours gold with a small head. Aroma is citrus hops with a touch of sulphur. Taste is straw, with light citrus hops on the slightly acrid finish.

Fruity aroma, with hints of apple, followed by a good dose of earthy and dusty English hops, adding up to a decent, if unspectacular, best bitter in a fairly traditional style.
Wychwood Battleaxe;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Strong fruitiness to the aroma with some herbal, floral and earthy hop tones.

Raasted Brown Ale (3.8%);Randers, Denmark;Brown Ale;Raasted Bryghus;Bottled. A clear, brown beer with a beige head. Weak, roasted and malty aroma, followed by some wet leather and fruits. Roasted malt, some hops and fruits makes the flavor, which finishes lightly roasted and malty. Thin-bodied beer, but it is only 3.8% ABV, so it’s as expected. One of the most boring from Raasted, yet a quaffable, sessionable beer. (070119)

Baggaardsbryggeriet New A Foxy Ale;Holstebro, Denmark;Brown Ale;Baggaardsbryggeriet;[Sampled together with the standard Foxy Ale] A deep red beer with a huge quite fluffy light brown head - not much different than the standard. The aroma is sweet berry like, but also with a acidic medicinal touch - not a whole lot of difference, but the standard is a bit less acidic and a bit more malty. The flavor is malty with a slight acid front, but then the malt comes thru, but in the aftertaste the acidity wins again - I can’t find any traces of the honey used. The standard is also in the flavor a bit less acidic. The only point where this beer is better than the stardard is in the body - it has a bit more.

Captain Elizurs Heritage Red Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Paper City Brewery;(22 oz. bottle from Rum Runner) Pours very murky brownish-amber (where’s the Red?) with just a bit of light brown head that retreats mostly to edges. Rich sugary malt aroma of brown sugar, prune, molasses and raisin that definitely got my interest. Medium-heavy mouthfeel, light carbonation, perhaps a bit loose. Starts almost buttery smooth but finishes a bit rougher. Also lightly dry on the back end. Flavor is basically a weaker reflection of the aroma, with notes of brown sugar, raisin, chocolate and perhaps licorice but unfortunately seems muted. A little sour/tangy toward the finish which seemed out of place.
Captain Elizurs Heritage Red Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Paper City Brewery;In the bomber bottle. Pours a reddish amber with a huge off white head. Has a brett aroma like it is supposed to be a flemmish sour. It even has a slight oakiness, but the big question is this: Is this supposed to be in this beer? Intentional, or a lucky mistake? Has a very over carbonated harsh palate. It’s either gone bad (rating 2.0) or this is quite a nice beer. I’ll give it the benefit of the doubt.
Captain Elizurs Heritage Red Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Paper City Brewery;Tasting @ argo0’s place. Bomber, 2006. Murky sewer water pour with a beige head. Odd nose, caramel and prune, something sour. Flavor is bready and raisiny, mild oakiness. Meh.
Captain Elizurs Heritage Red Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Paper City Brewery;22oz bottle. 2006 Vintage. Not a gusher but some beer was creeping out. Poured a deeper and muddy brown color with a huge sized off white head. Aromas of wood (oak), some cherries and other dark fruits, vanilla, and yeast. Tastes of some woodiness, vanilla, dark fruits, and caramel. Tastes on the softer side. Thinner body. A bit over priced (I paid $10 for this one).
Captain Elizurs Heritage Red Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Paper City Brewery;From a 22oz Bottle. Courtesy of CharlesDarwin. Highly carbonated, murky brown colored pour with a tall head of fine bubbled ivory. Tart, funky, brett aroma with some pleasant cherry skin tannins. Grapey wood, fresh plum fruits, and subtle notes of vanilla. Light bodied, over-carbonated mouthfeel with a dry, tart texture. Body is a little bit thin, but well attenuated, not oxidized. Flavors of cherries, white grape skins, and peppery oak. Moderately tart, with minimal acetic presence and superb dryness. The flavors are a little bit thin and un-complex, but certainly enjoyable. Lots of brett, light on the cherry. Kind of like an un-acetic oud bruin with brett. Good. Overcarbonated, but not horribly so. Thanks, Tom!
Captain Elizurs Heritage Red Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Paper City Brewery;22oz Bottle, purchased at Downtown Liquors in Somerville, MA. Overcarbonated gusher, but a nice gentle cherry juice and soured malt nose. Soft, lightly sweet and tangy. No harsh acids or vinegar. A bit of stemmy woodiness and some cotton. Nice aroma. Pours a murky and hazed red-brown, with many fingers of slowly settling rosy-ochre tinted head. Flavor is decent, if a little thin. There are gentle soft fruits mingled in with citric and lactic acid. Lambic-like, as opposed to Oud Bruin like, I think. Cotton and fluff. The body doesn’t really hold much in terms of density, sweetness or flavor, but I’m okay with that. I can see how this score lowly. It has a shallow, lightly bitter oak character in the rear of the palate, maybe originating from hops. The flavors are clean (maybe too clean?). Other than being over carbonated and a bit too thin, I like this. It’s got the right suite of wildness in it. The good ones. Not too tart, not too sour, not too biting. A very soft wildness. The kind I like.
Captain Elizurs Heritage Red Ale;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Paper City Brewery;"""2006 oak-aged"" courtesy of Maniac.

Mendocino Red Tail Lager;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);From Dec 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle(room temp) a clear reddish gold with a large head of foam that shrank to a broken layer that remained mainly in the center of the glass. The smell is on the weak side but I note some sweet malt. The taste has sweet malt tones but I detect a graininess more than anything else. Further sips only enhance the taste of grain and it makes for a rather dull, imo, Lager that has a pretty decent colour for the style. This one is just *not* working favourably on my palate. Others may like it and that's a good thing but it's not working for me at all. Bottom line: I'm not fond of this Red Lager at all. Try it and see what you think

A better premium lager if you are into one.
Wildwood Red Mile Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;Calgary’s red mile became prominent during the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs when the Calgary Flames made an unlikely run for Lord Stanley’s holy grail. While the playoff run itself was remarkable, the beer named after it is anything but. A clear amber lager with a thin head, the aroma is usually weak sweet caramel malt and some stale hops. The flavour was usually skunked malt - but it’s a hockey themed beer and that’s good enough for me!
Wildwood Red Mile Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;Clear reddish orange. A fair amount of hops on the nose as well as musty elements. Smooth feel. Not much taste to speak of at all. A tad bit watery.
Wildwood Red Mile Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;Draught at the brewpub Amber color, creamy head. Poor aroma. Some caramel flavor, light, dry, correct bitterness. Boring, I couldn’t drink a pint.
Wildwood Red Mile Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;(Draught) Sampled on February 8, 2008, at the brewpub. Thin, white lasting head with a copper body. No carbonation. Nose is somewhat muted but the flavour is fantastic - highlighted by a strong cocoa base with a skim milk finish. Very nice.
Wildwood Red Mile Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;[817-20071105] Tap @ Wildwood (Calgary, AB). Mild faint yeast aroma. Clear, red amber body with a long-lasting creamy off-white head and some lacing. Grainy yeast flavour has some creamy Irish coffee without the coffee roast and a bit of grassy hops in the background. Medium body, nice feel. Good, repeatable.
Wildwood Red Mile Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;Draft at the brewpub. Amber body with a small off white head. Light bitterness, light tangy oddness. Similar, lightly acidic tang to the malty aroma. Average palate. Underwhelming.
Wildwood Red Mile Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;"Draft pint at the brewpub; same giant goblet as the pilsner, so the wife had to help out. Very dark red. Caramelly aroma ... sweet to the tongue, with a bit of a light body, but decently flavored. Caramel, almost a hint of coffee. Very mellow. Quaffable. (#2876, 5/13/2007)"
Wildwood Red Mile Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;Clear deep copper-red with a moderate off-white head displaying solid retention and lace. Very rich roasted-nut aroma and flavour, like a mouthfull of darkly roasted hazelnuts and almonds. With this much flavour and aroma, I expected a fuller-bodied beer, but the palate was a little on the thin side (maybe this is in keeping with its designation as a vienna?). Excellent.
Wildwood Red Mile Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;It’s a lovely shade of red, goes down very smooth, and is very satisfying. You’ll definitely want to start with this one, it’s creamy and leaves a nice aftertaste in your mouth.
Wildwood Red Mile Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;Copper color, thin white head, fruity mildly caramel nose. Mouth is all over the place and is a total caramel train wreck, with an off putting finish. Yuck.
Carolina Brewery Imperial Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Imperial;Carolina Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Very dark brown in color with a lasting one-finger tan head and good lacing. Roasty aroma with anise and molasses along with some coffee. The flavor is decent but not as full and tasty as I expect from this style. Coffee roastiness with anise and molasses and a hint of dark chocolate. Medium-bodied and on the drier side with carbonation below average. Overall decent but not great for the style.
Carolina Brewery Imperial Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Imperial;Carolina Brewery;Pours dark brown with a thin ring of tan bubbles. Smells of dark fruit, boozy, roasted malt. Tastes of roasted malt, bitter, pepper, some chocolatey hints. Enojoyable!
Carolina Brewery Imperial Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Imperial;Carolina Brewery;Black pour with large tan head for the style. Coffee and malty aroma, flavor is of coffee, hint of caramel, but metallic and watery on the finish. Very unbalanced version of the style.
Carolina Brewery Imperial Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Imperial;Carolina Brewery;Pours a dark black with one finger of chocolaty tan head. Nose is mildly metallic with notes of fruit skins and coffee. Favor is better, rich chocolate and some coffee with some acidity. Palate shows some roast and bitterness with a noticeable acidity.
Carolina Brewery Imperial Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Imperial;Carolina Brewery;12oz. via bmartin08. Drank at cellar temp. Pour is oily black with thick foamy brown head. Aromas strong of roasted malts, coffee, and a hint of alcohol. Flavor is very malty and roasty. Toffee flavors were also in the finish. Mid-grade impy at most. This one is nothing to jump up and down about.
Carolina Brewery Imperial Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Imperial;Carolina Brewery;Best I’ve had from the Carolina Brewery. On tap at WBF in Raleigh. Nice black pour with dark mocha head. Very roasty, but no burnt bitterness. Tons of coffee and chocolate and a creamy taste. Really quite good.

Carolina Brewery Imperial Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Imperial;Carolina Brewery;Via trade with OldStyleCubFan, 12oz bottle, cool to see a cbc cap this week during CBC in San Diego.

Carolina Brewery Imperial Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Imperial;Carolina Brewery;bottle left at my house by Todd - thanks! Good all around stout. Poured very dark brown with a tight tan head. great lacing along the way. tastes were roasted malts, coffee grinds, and smoke. would like to try a few more of these real soon..
Carolina Brewery Imperial Stout;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Imperial;Carolina Brewery;Pours a very dark brown with absolutely no head to speak of. Smell is coffee, roasted malts and some alcohol. Taste is much the same, but something is smoothing this thing out. I don’t know when this was bottled, but this one tastes a little aged. Still plenty of roastiness. Good beer, needs to come a little bigger than this though.
Town Hall Roggen Bier;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours a deep brownish red, with an inch or so of soft and creamy beige colored foam. Brief head retention, little lacing. Sweet malt and some rye bread in the aroma. Flavor far less sweet than the aroma indicates. Toasted malt, dry rye bread and wheat bread. A chlorophyll-green (almost minty) flavor permeates each sip, becoming even more noticeable in the finish. When I was a kid, I used to chew on the stem of some kind of wild grass or weed (hairy vetch, maybe?) while hiking at the Stony Creek Metropark north of Detroit. That’s the green near-minty flavor I get with this beer. Just a touch of floral hops. Almost medium bodied, with mild carbonation.
Town Hall Roggen Bier;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Fresh growler 10/8/05: Clear dull mahogany. Small and firm cap of light tan froth developes from an eager pour out of the growler, but it went away quickly leaving only a thin collar. Very minimal lacing. Aroma has quite a pep to it with a fresh yeasty spicyness to it. Unique and wild with an off bread tone that does carry some of the rye spice quality to it. Nutty and smokey in its effort after it begins to settle. Flavors are nice with interestingly set tender sweetness and light bready/doughy malts and lots of easily appealing and popping spices. Oats, poppyseeds, nuts, seasame, pumpernickle, rye, clove, and yeasty esters make welcome spicy noting all across the playing field in this one. Its like one of those ""everything"" bagels that has nearly everything in them. Love the bready spices in this. Feel is actually fairly light bodied. Very clean, snappy, crunchy, doughy, smooth, crisp, and quick. It really lets the spices take there place in the finishing areas. A bready spiced treat. It reminded me a bit of what an OSA might be if it were toned down by about 4 or 5 notches. Drinkable. Yep. Definately worth filling up the glass with more then once."
Town Hall Roggen Bier;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Surprisingly refreshing, with a grainy chewiness in the texture and strong cereal flavors. Strong hop bitterness, mainly in the finish, and some interesting peppery spicing as well.
Town Hall Roggen Bier;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Dark Brown Coloring with Red Tints and a Sandy Ring. Sweet Caramel Malt and Dry Rye Aroma. Carbonated..Bitter Sweet on the Tongue.. Sweet Malt Background and Dry, Bitter Rye Notes Lofting on Top. Alot of Bad Rye Brews Out There, But This Wouldn’t Be One of Them.
Town Hall Roggen Bier;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Deep copper, big puffy head. Nose peppery and spicy, lots of rye and some intriguing smoke. Flavor has a nice rye astringency to it with a bright, hoppy finish and good sweetness. Very spicy, quite nice.
Town Hall Roggen Bier;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"I was hopping for a clone of Burgerbrau roggenbier but this one didn’t quite live up. Weizen bock seems to be an appropriate style, though it is a little weak for that. Light wehat aroma. Flavors of light wheat and sour rye. The beer is dark brown with no head and minimal carbonation. Fairly drinkable, with the sweet wheat juxtaposed with sour rye. An ok beer; at least they are trying to branch out with styles."
Town Hall Roggen Bier;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Smells rich and alcoholic. Dried prunes and rotting apricots. Dark reddish brown color. No head, no lace, but nice color. Thick engine oil appearance. Initial mouthfeel is lighter than I expected from the nose and the body. Improves as it warms. Reasonable complexity. Unique. Initial mouthfeel is undercarbonated but it has a fizzy feel at the back of the tongue. Good beer front to finish.
Town Hall Roggen Bier;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Dark amber color with a medium head. Subtle aroma of grains, not much else. The flavor is a great mix of grains and grape. The rye seems to have added a good sweetness to the beer. Incredibly smooth and creamy for a pushed beer. Tasty as sin!
Town Hall Roggen Bier;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"forgive me, not seeing a ""rye beer"" or ""roggenbier"" category on RateBeer, I threw a dart and it stuck here. Anyone with better ideas, go for it. Based on the German style, with about 30% rye used in the grain bill. Tasting from a growler, after 2 pints at the pub. Full crimson appearance, deeply opaque, with a blooming creamy head, though swift in settling to nothingness. Nose is grainy and sweet, bright fruitiness at play, some hops, as well. Taste bursts with sweet fruititude, apples and berries, but always contained by the rye character which is forward and full, rich and ringing with graininess and that never-flagging fruit flavor. This is a unique treat that I’d like to see more of...how many others are there? Damnably tasty, despite it’s rarity. A very special beer, not for every day consumption, not ideal for a session, but one I’d like to return to once in a while, when I can."

Milwaukee Brewing Old Tankard Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Pabst Brewing Company;Can. Poured a golden color with a larger sized head. Seeing that this is retired and looking at the dates, this one was probably in my can box for way too long ... but fresh, not sure if it would have made a difference.
Milwaukee Brewing Old Tankard Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Pabst Brewing Company;"This beer wasn’t very good. Its like dark PBR. Really, it just made me want regular PBR. However, the name ""Old Tankard"" is pretty cool."
Milwaukee Brewing Old Tankard Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Pabst Brewing Company;Hazy Light Gold Coloring with White Skin. Sweet Malt and Hops Aroma. Initial Hit of Hops Flavoring, Quickly Giving Way to Dry Wheat and Sweet Malt Notes. Drinkable but Nothing Characterable About it.
Milwaukee Brewing Old Tankard Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Pabst Brewing Company;Clear, nearly pale yellow in color with a creamy white wrung for the head. Brisk lemons, perfumey hops and lemon herbed croissants exemplify the bright and floral nature of the nose. Nice hoppy profile, quickly recessing to a low fat crescent roll flavor. Lemons, sourdough crust and sage add flavor character as well. In and out, over and done. Hops resonate moderately when it’s all come to pass. Decent.

Oxidzed, stale hop and grainy pale malt in the flavor. Dry, stale finish with a light fruity hoppiness. This stuff pretty much sucks. It has a macro aura that drags it down.
Milwaukee Brewing Old Tankard Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Pabst Brewing Company;Sampled this session ale. Supposedly, it’s based on a recipe from Pabst. They had an Old Tankard a long time ago. It pours to a hazy straw colored body with a thin white head. The aroma is hard to distinguish. I get hops and bitterness. English hops I think. I wish the bar was less smoky. The flavor is kind of a grassy and floral hop. Almost like an alfalfa or hay. Iced tea. Light barley, light tobacco. I’m digging this. The palate is lightly bitter, medium bodied, has a lingering flavor, a vibrant carbonation.
Milwaukee Brewing Old Tankard Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Pabst Brewing Company;Lightly hazed golden liquid with a moderate off white head. Aromas of pale malt, with a strong presence of hops. Hops nose includes floral, herbal and mild citrus components. Full malt and hops flavors. Lots of hops in the flavors with a mild licorice part.

WAB Hefeweizen;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Woodward Avenue Brewers;This beer had a strong mint and lemon scent, almost peppermint, where the mint was far more powerful than the lemon, giving this beer a very unique and enjoyable taste. The color was almost bright yellow, nearly matching the lemon on the glass, but it was also very cloudy, in a good way. This beer was very delicious.
WAB Hefeweizen;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Woodward Avenue Brewers;This was the only highlight of the WAB. The beer is a hazy gold nice heavy head. The aroma is light clove, banana which is nice. Taste is very wheaty with a banana finish. Nice feel, easy to drink. The big problem here is a lemon wedge they put on the glass. It leaves some strong aromas which are too lasting. Pretty good hefe, the only beer to drink here.
WAB Hefeweizen;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Woodward Avenue Brewers;This is an average Hefeweizen. I wouldn’t knock it for being average (though the 2.4 rating looks pretty sad) but it’s nothing to write home about. Worth the 2 bucks if you go on sunday night when everything is half off.
WAB Hefeweizen;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Woodward Avenue Brewers;Slightly above undrinkable. This is one hefe where the lemon comes in handy. Drop it it. The taste of this beer is hardly a taste.

Triple fff Gilbert White;Alton, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Triple fff Brewery;500ml bottle (Black Door, Helsinki) Hazy orange, huge head. Gentle tarry smoke aroma. Almost wheat-beery sourness too. A bit watery, and a bit fizzy in the mouth. No sign of 6.3%, it seems weaker than that. Black tea in the finish. Some smokiness in the taste, but more tarry. Some wheatiness in the taste too, with the associated sharpness. Quirky and interesting, but the carbonation’s too high, and it’s not really pressing my buttons.

Hints of hops and some"
Triple fff Gilbert White;Alton, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Triple fff Brewery;Hazy gold. Not a pretty beer to look at. A strange aroma of honey, cheese and smoked bacon. Malty taste with medium to strong bitterness and a general background of pork scratchings. I’m unconvinced that this is anything like the beer they drank in 18th century Hampshire, however I enjoyed the eclectic experience.
Triple fff Gilbert White;Alton, Hampshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Triple fff Brewery;Bottled. Hazy pale orange with low minimal white head. Smokey aroma of ropes and ham (is this from Bamberg???) with notes of herbs and grassy hops. Yum! Full flavour of smoke, fudge and caramel. Mild but long solid aftertaste of peat, toated malts, grass and straw. A damn good cross of Hampshire and Bamberg.
Aqula Habuen no Beer;Akita, Japan;Flavored - Other;Aqula;"First let me say the ""Habu"" in the name is the Japanese phonetic pronunciation of ""Herb"". I didn’t see any herb other than Hops listed on the bottle though. Smells like a typical macro lager with just a slight earthy malt scent, not really any herbal smell to it. Nice mild sweet malty flavor, light and crisp and a tasty Pilsner but no trace of herbs in this other than hops! I’m just confused by why this is called Herb beer!"

Acorn Sovereign;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Acorn Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Postern Gate (JDW), York. Medium white head. Chestnut to mahogany body. Aroma is citrus, nutty, malty, spicy and fruity. Gentle bitterness with a dry, bitter finish.
Acorn Sovereign;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Acorn Brewery;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Brown bitter. A solid feeling to this one. Hazelnut flavour, with perhaps some ginger and nutmeg. Feels rich, like a pudding topping, but not cloying. Pretty complex. Deserves respect.
Acorn Sovereign;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Acorn Brewery;Pint from cask at Far from the Madding Crowd in Oxford. Pours a deep amber caramel brown -- very nice. Smells of buttery and roasted nut, tea, and yeast (the yeast smell was a little unexpected). Taste is initially a malty complex with a striking note of coffee and roast. The dark note is later absorbed into the main body of flavor while releasing notes of butter, nut, citrus, and hops. At the least, an interesting show of flavors. Finish is dry and a tad peppery. An enjoyable pub drink -- not the epitome of beer, but it is at least interesting.
Acorn Sovereign;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Acorn Brewery;Cask, Criterion, Leicester. Copper, ruby with a fluffy foam. Aromas are cocoa and lemon with nutty notes and tea. Earthy hops with hints of pine. Flavours are toffee malts with autumn leaves and some sharp citrus. Earthy, peppery hops with a dry finish. Good.
Acorn Sovereign;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Acorn Brewery;cask at cloisters ...copper thin off white lacing... soft chocolate ... light toffee malt nose ... light dry toffee hop ... quite nice if a little dry for me.
Acorn Sovereign;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Acorn Brewery;Cask handpull at The Thirsty Pig, Maidstone. Looking at Duff’s rating of this beer from all those years ago, he is completely correct. He really does have one of the best noses and palates of any rater I have met. And I rather miss reading his ratings. Anyway this is an attractive dark brown colour with slightly toasted malts that give a fullness and dryness to the beer. The hops are excellent and vear on the grapefruit side. Enormously drinkable beer.
Hardys & Hansons Sunburst;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hardys & Hansons;Cask Conditioned, at The Waterhouse, Manchester. Pale straw yellow with only the slightest hop aroma. Not cleverly constructed the beer is thin and asks no questions of the consumer!? Quaffable and that’s about it.

Great Waters Scarlet Pimpernel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Waters Brewing;CASK: Amber Coloring with White Creamy Head. Lemon and Chamomile on the Nose and Tongue. Creamy Mouthfeel. Light Dry Hop Aftertaste. Sugary Sweet Taste to it. Overall Very Light to Drink...If I Wanted to Make a Beer with Tea Herb Qualities to It, This Would be Something to Shoot For.
Great Waters Scarlet Pimpernel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Waters Brewing;On cask at the brewpub: No longer the red it once was as the beet juice has been removed from the finishing stages of the recipe from its earlier release. Now its a calming light gold hue with a clearish body. Solid capping of off-white froth sits on top with a bit of smoothed oatmealy texture. Lacing sticks in broken strings and spotting. Aroma is a bit lemony and musty honeyish with a nice aromatic presence of chamomile and fresh spring flowers. A fairly strong bouquet here, perhaps a bit one sided with the incense-like demeanor but I like it. Taste is sweet and tender with a nice crisp edge where some evident honey coated bread and candyish malting play within the chamomile and floral tones. Stays pretty flavorful with flowery spices and grasses, not the hot kind of spice, more like potpourri or candle-like incense. Chamomile is the biggest presence then I tend to think of jasmine, cinnamon, mint, and dried vegetable soup stock. Interesting play between the sweeter candy coated honey malt and its seasoning spices. Feel is quick and clean with one very simple light body. Boldness or thickness isn’t really meant to be its strong point, and that does tend to keep it from being, perhaps, a bit more entralling to the palate. I’m giving it a bit of a nudge up though for what it is and why its being offered as such. Trying to get the average drinker to try a cask/warm beer is difficult when its not a lighter styled beer. So this is their new lure. Not a bad idea nor a bad beer. I liked it and would and probably will have it again.
Great Waters Scarlet Pimpernel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Waters Brewing;"Thin bodied and very watery...not much in the way of hop bitterness to help lift this one out of mediocrity. Too timid and also suffers from the pervasive ""floral"" notes that so many of their beers seem to suffer from. My glass seemed flat and maybe even a little stale or played out."
Great Waters Scarlet Pimpernel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Cloudy dirty orange. Nice nose, fruity, light clove, a bit wheaty with some candy sugar. Flavor not as good, odd spiciness mixed with tartness and honey.
Great Waters Scarlet Pimpernel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Cloudy appearance. Light spices. Some honey and hops in the aroma. A session beer. One has to give Great Waters credit for trying things like this. This experiment turned out ok.
Great Waters Scarlet Pimpernel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Cask. Darker red color with a medium head. Earthy aroma with a lot of vegetable-like qualities. The taste is light and floral with a hint of raddishes. The honey does stand out on the finish. Definitely different.
Old Capitol Oktoberfest Bier;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;On tap at the brewpub. 10/07/07. Hazy orange caramel with a fairly long lasting off-white head, pretty good retention. Typical OCBW aroma of pale biscuity malts, and a light citrus hop character. Flavor has some citrus and sweet biscuity caramel--tastes nothing like any Oktoberfests I’ve had. I dunno what it is, but it doesn’t taste bad. Bitterness peaks at a 2-3. Light carbonation with a light to medium body. Not too bad, but one was enough.
Old Capitol Oktoberfest Bier;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Draught at the brewpub.

Tastes of malty caramel and fresh cereal grain.
Old Capitol Oktoberfest Bier;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Dark orange body with a thin white head.

This needs something to balance out the very sweet character.

Real Ale Lost Gold IPA;Blanco, Texas, United States;IPA;Real Ale Brewing Company;Lifted into my usual sampling tulip glass. It pours a great golden amber with a good white head that laces well and is replenished by an active stream of carbonation. The expected IPA-ey scent of pine and hay. The taste is spruce and citrus, hops, straightforward, nothing complex. And that is swell. Finish is bitter. Stays in your mouth awhile.

Pee Klak Royal;Ichtegem, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Strubbe;330ml bottle from Dranken Geers. Pours clear amber, medium off-white foam atop. Aroma bears yeasty caramel hints, some light vanilla perhaps. Wouldn't necessarily peg it in the tripel category on taste. Deeper caramel malt flavours surfacing that a tripel would tend to avoid, though a familiar distant yeasty sweetness remains. Light biere de garde spice, lightly caramelised malt, light bodied with medium to high carbonation. Just doesn't seem to offer anything new or compelling in the current climate.

The aroma was brown malt and malt hop. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of brown malt and was metallic mild and very thin. Not one that I would likely buy again.

It’s got a bright orange body with a decent head doing some respectable lacing. The aroma is light, sweet and malty with some soft nuts. The flavor is crisp toast with honey and a touch of caramel.

Brass Octoberfest Lager;South Barrington, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brass Restaurant & Brewery;Well, I’m assuming this is the same as Marzen Amber Lager which I just had. The guy said it was their Octoberfest style beer. Anyways, This is translucent amber with a short creamy head. Aroma is malty and hardly any hops are present. The flavor was tame, but in a good way. Soft malts and balanced by some slightly spicy hops. Texture is very smooth. Medium bodied. Surprisingly good. It might be the best Brass beer I’ve had.
Brass Octoberfest Lager;South Barrington, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brass Restaurant & Brewery;This one has no head, and is very dark orange.

Shenandoah Holiday Spiced Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Other;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Transcribed from my 2005 tasting notes: Tasted bottle into standard pint glass. Poured brown color with medium off-white head. Interesting aromas of bread, spices, evergreen, faint hops. Tastes similar to a honey porter with diverse spices. Fruity ale yeast fermentation. Lasting bittersweet aftertaste.

Very full, round and creamy on the palate with lively carbonation. No lacing or head retention. Overall, a surprisingly solid beer."

Manos Black Bear;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada;Brown Ale;Manos Grill & Brewpub;Label said dark pale ale but brown seemed to be a better category than pale. 1L bottle. Thin malty aroma, a touch of caramel. A very light head on dark copper beer. Flavour has a burnt toffee and coffee edge to it. Perhaps a little thin but the first Mano’s beer that I would drink a second one. CORRECTION. I had a second bottle and it was undrinkable.

Santa Cruz Mountain Organic Devout Stout;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Stout;Santa Cruz Mountain Brewing;Near black with tan head. Surprisingly rich and creamy for a 5% beer, with chocolatey goodness throughout, and hints of bitterness and roasted coffee. Nice.
Santa Cruz Mountain Organic Devout Stout;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Stout;Santa Cruz Mountain Brewing;From Oct 2006 Poured from 22oz bottle(room temp) a pitch black with a large off-white head of foam that takes some time to settle down leaving a solid layer with quite a bit of lacing. The smell is is a strong mix of citrus bitterness and coffee. The initial taste threw me off..I note a big lemony or maybe it is lime(?) hoppy flavour mixed with a sourness and just the faintest hint of the coffee that I noted in the nose. A few more sips in to the bottle and my palate becomes used to the hoppy bitterness and more of the coffee notes come into play along with some minor chocolate presence but for me, the hops in this stout takes center stage and now...some vanilla flavour also enters the scene. This, imho, is quite the different American Stout and I'm liking it. Bottom line: This is, maybe, the most unusual American Stout I've tasted and I'm glad I got to try it. Give it a shot if you see it!
Santa Cruz Mountain Organic Devout Stout;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Stout;Santa Cruz Mountain Brewing;July 25th, 2014 - Our journey to Santa Cruz Mountain Brewery ends with the darkest beer of the lot - the stout. Dark and meditative, it looks patient, having waited for all the other samplers to be tasted before itself. The smell is muddy, earthy, with heavy malt overtones, and a dab of chocolate, but the flavor is thin and mild. So is the mouthfeel, which does little to assist the flavor palate.

North Coast Le Merle;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;North Coast Brewing Company;One of the most amazing Saison style beers I have ever had. This is a legendary beer and has multiple deep levels of flavor. By far my favorite beer so far in my 15 year beer testing journey.

Fitgers Cherry Edmund Stout (Oak Aged);Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fitgers Brewhouse;Very confused flavors...is it a sweet stout or a cherry fruit beer or something else altogether. Even threw in a slightly smoky oak flavor, but they have so many other fine beers, why this one?
Fitgers Cherry Edmund Stout (Oak Aged);Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fitgers Brewhouse;This would have been good if they could have singled out some flavor or aromas here as this is something gone bad.the flavors are muddled with some cherry but the oak is hidden.
Fitgers Cherry Edmund Stout (Oak Aged);Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fitgers Brewhouse;Beer Train. Ruby-fringed deep brown-black pour, with a chocolate colored head. Aroma oa rich earthy dark chocolate blended evenly with fresh juicy cherries and some coconut. Flavor is much the same, but extremely well balanced. Especially compared to the Bourbon Barrel version. Apparently this has 1000 pounds of fresh Door County cherries, whereas the Bourbon Barrel had some quantity of Sour cherries. Big difference, as this is much, much better. The bitter, deep stout characterisitics fade a little and the oak tones really shine with the fresh cherry flavor. Very smooth and not overly alcoholic. Lacks much texture and depth beyond an even blend of chocolate, coffee, a drop of cream, and lucious dark cherries.
Brooklyn Blast!;Brooklyn, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Keg at The Hanging Bat. Hazy golden body with a thick white head. Steady carbonation. Good lacing. Aroma of burnt orange, stewed tea and marmalade. Flavour pine, orange peel, honey and menthol. Medium body with a slick, oily texture that coats the mouth. Light fizz. It’s packed full of hops but it’s quite heavy and syrupy. Verging into Barley Wine territory?

Butte Creek Organic Pilsner;Ukiah, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Fruity and fresh with a slightly bitter aftertaste that finishes off the first sweetness really well. Not as bitter as I would expect my real Pilsner to be -and as I personally like it - but that’s to be expected, I guess.
Butte Creek Organic Pilsner;Ukiah, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Butte Creek Brewing Company;"Pilsner is a style I never had much affinity for until the last few years. So many breweries make generic pale lagers than they call “pilsner” but really only few put out traditional, to-spec pilsners and Butte Creek’s “Organic Pilsner” is an example of one done right. This is a clean-tasting, yet fairly complex palette that’s gorgeous-looking and amazingly drinkable. I’m scoring it high because of those latter two factors. I poured a 12oz bottle into a footed pilsner glass. There was no freshness date. It cost $3 ($0.25 per ounce). Appearance: Perfectly golden hue; nearly crystal clear with plenty of effervescence always visible. Pours to a medium-sized, white, frothy head which retains laces very well. Smell: Light spicy Noble hops and plenty of pils malt. No DMS. Taste: There’s a difference between true pilsner and pale lager. Anyone that doesn’t understand the difference would do well to try this beer as a good example. Light spicy hop sensation right away. Not especially bitter at only 26 IBUs, though it is a little tingly from the Noble hops. Slight cracker-like maltiness through the middle with a zesty lemony sensation as it goes down. Well-balanced to be sure, but still quite delectable. It may not be amazingly delicious, but it is much much more than just satisfying. It’s a pilsner drinker’s pilsner. Drinkability: It’s rare to find a commercial pilsner under 5% ABV. At 4.5% ABV, Butte Creek Organic Pilsner is one of the lightest versions you’ll find by a mainstream brewery. It doesn’t sacrifice body, though. Yes it’s thin and crisp in the mouth, but it’s by no means watery or boring. There’s constant flavor delivery from beginning to end and quite refreshing while in the mouth. This would be a perfect brew to utilize the convenience of cans rather than bottles. Sessionable for drinkers of all skill levels. Score: 9/10"
Butte Creek Organic Pilsner;Ukiah, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Beer of month club. Pours a straw color with decent head. Malt/yeast nose.

Rahr & Sons Pecker Wrecker;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Rahr & Sons Brewing;A bomber, pours clear and a darker gold. It has 8% ABV, stamped on the label, in a very hard to see ink. I know the description on rate beer says 7%. That must have been a previous, older batch. This bad boy is 8%. Also stamped it says it was brewed in 2014 (no month denoted), and it says 70 IBUs. 70 IBUs for a Pilsner is unheard of! This 8% beauty is easy drinking, smells and tastes hoppy like you’d imagine for an Imperial Pilsner, and goes down easily, with a clean, crisp finish. It’s lighter on the palate than an Imperial IPA. I give this brew high ratings because it deserves it. A dated bomber, 70 IBUs, and at a reasonable price, you can’t lose. Add in the less filling Pilsner style and it is a real winner!

Aroma of toasty Munich malt and authentic German yeast with a hint of tartness. Body starts with a sweet earthy caramel maltiness, balanced with a fresh, lightly piney noble hop bitterness toward a sticky bittersweet, warming finish.

Sockeye Dark Star Dunkel (Whiskey Barrel Aged);Boise, Idaho, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Sockeye Brewing;This beer was sampled via growler at Pitonkatonks house to celebrate the arrival of Facto, Buck Dich and Indiana Red. This beer pours a cloudy, murky, reddish-brown substance with a soapy white head and very little lacing. The aroma is very noticeably whiskey. I understand that this was sockeye’s first attempt at barrel aging and it shows. Also in the nose was oak, wood, smoke, roasted barley and a hint of alcohol. Flavor-wise it was medium bodied, but what was really interesting was the lack of whiskey in the flavor. Generally speaking this went from mildly carbonated in the glass to practically flat and slightly silky in the mouth. Hints of caramel, nuts and roastyness and a tiny hint of licorice. Very simple and to the point...

Rock Bottom Chicago Chicagos Finest IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Chicago;Damn good IPA. golden orange, very cloudy, no sediment, fluffy white head, very creamy. Nose is mad grapefruit rinds and some caramel hints. Taste is a beautiful explosion of grapefruit, lime, orange, and toffee. Wel balanced, not overly bitter. Solid. One of the best IPA’s Ive had in a while.
Rock Bottom Chicago Chicagos Finest IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Chicago;Draught, October 2005: golden orange body with a fluffy ivory head. Aromatic grapefruit rinds, and other bitter citrus notes dominate the nose. Full mouth feel with the bitterness clinging to the sides of the mouth and the orange zest wrapping the tongue. Hints of caramel sweetened grain come in at the finish and though the after taste is dominated by grapefruit and hop resin, some of the malts and grains do come through. Not quite as good as the Goose Island version if you are looking for a Chicago-made IPA, but tasty and drinkable.
Rock Bottom Chicago Chicagos Finest IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Sample at the brewpub. Hazy still medium amber with a bit of lasting creamy head, nearly opaque...gorgeous sweet vanilla-almond notes underpin sharp citrusy (Cascades, again?) nose...highly quaffable body could be a little sharper though the softness makes it an easy gulp...bitterness grows late, acerbic dry grassiness and citrus keep it humming. Quite nice; I generally like my IPAs more pungent and earthy, but this is a good example of the more straightforwardly bitter/citrusy variety."
Rock Bottom Chicago Chicagos Finest IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Chicago;Chicago location. The beer pours to a nice, glowing gold body with a nice white head. The aroma has Cascade hops, citrus, grapefruit, limes, oranges. The flavor is very smooth. Oranges, grapefruit, limes. Not assaultingly bitter. Well-balanced. Tastes awesome. Smooth refreshing medium bodied beer. This is a good IPA.
Rock Bottom Chicago Chicagos Finest IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Chicago;Hazy, golden body with a frothy, white head. The nose is quite hoppy and definitely fruity, with some sweet caramel undertones. Grapefruit and oranges are the dominate hop elements, with bits of pine poking through from time to time. The body is fairly full and definitely satisfying, fairly carbonated, without being too prickly or unpleasant. Initially, the tongue is inundated with fruit juice, mostly orange, but definite grapefruit to keep bitter, before sweet caramel and an onslaught of hoppy bitterness. Some grainy cereals appear from time to time as well. The finish is long and bitter, with fresh hop bitterness riding out to the very end. Not a bad interpretation, though not the best.
Rock Bottom Chicago Chicagos Finest IPA;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Chicago;Clear, opulent yellow gold in color with an icy white sheen for the head. Aroma is subdued. Hop pellets, pine needles, spray starch and some honey, which divulges another layer of nuances. Incredibly balanced with nice malt sweetening. It’s not very aggressive, for better or worse, so have your cake and eat it too. Honey bread, lemon grass and piney hops give it a real forest sense, and all the while, it’s matched equivocally with caramel, toffee and nectar. Good take on the popular style. Nice lingering, bitter-sweet end.

Flavor is cherry over coffee and chocolate. Goes down well. Reminds of chocolate covered cherries sans sugar creme. Finish is dry roast with cherry and a little coffee. Surprisingly good. Might make an aperitif. Woke me up.
Lang Creek Cherry Porter;Marion, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;12oz Bottle Pours out a dark brown with a little red. Topped with a brownish red head. Aroma of milk chocolate and roast malt. Tast of malts and a little fruit. A bitter end.
Lang Creek Cherry Porter;Marion, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;"Bottle. Pours a nice deep brown with ruby red highlights. Aroma immediately brings Dr. Pepper to mind, so not a great first impression. But let the head settle a little and chocolate becomes much more apparent. The palate is nicely balanced with sweet chocolate malt and black cherries in a decent balance, although this is certainly leaning toward being a tad too sweet. Overall I enjoyed this, but I do have a soft spot for this kind of ""porter hybrid"" type of beer."
Lang Creek Cherry Porter;Marion, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;smells like a cherry pop, looks like a cherry pop mixed with root beer (uh oh!) - taste is actually better than I expected but tastes mostly like a sour cherry pop with unsweetened chocolate. Not much in the way of an actual beer in my opinion. Reminds of those old Diet Chocolate Raspberry pops flavored with Sacharin, so, in a word, yuck!
Lang Creek Cherry Porter;Marion, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Dark red/brown pour. Hints of chocolate with a very subdued cherry taste toward the end. Great Flavor
Lang Creek Cherry Porter;Marion, Montana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Lang Creek Brewing Co.;Bottle: Brown pour with a nice sized beige head. Aroma is rich with chocolate cover cherries. Bits of roast. Flavor is more porter oriented than fruit beer, some nice roast and chocolate with a subtle cherry accent. Much better than I had expected. Still, the cherry flavoring leaves a bit to be desired.

Fitgers Wildfire Lager;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Fitgers Brewhouse;On tap at Fitger's. Pours a cinnamon brown with minimal head. Scent is Tabasco and cinnamon with some habanero pepper. Taste is similar with Tabasco and pepper with an ashy taste as well but not in a negative sense. Mouthfeel is spicy and lingers. Leaves you lips tingling. A good experience beer, but I wouldn't want to drink on a regular basis.
Fitgers Wildfire Lager;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Fitgers Brewhouse;Draft. Golden amber pour, jalapeno aroma, flavor is jalepenos, little malt flavor, doesn’t get too vegetal, not too spicy either, fairly decent. No diacetyl,
Fitgers Wildfire Lager;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Fitgers Brewhouse;This is really a hard review for me. I’m a huge fan of all things spicy and a huge fun of beer but I’m having a hard time dissecting the way in which they mix here. Had it on tap at the brewhouse along side a Gale Force. The body is a hazy burnt orange with a finger of dense white head. Good lacing. Every thing seems in order in that respect. The nose had me wondering... there was an obvious malt presence that seemed balanced enough, but it was overshadowed by the smell of the peppers. And not in the way you would expect - no real spice, more like sweet bell peppers. The taste took a similar direction. Up front there were some soft, basic malt notes. But then a wave of vegetable bits that then get snuffed out by the one redeeming aspect of the taste for me: immense heat. I actually enjoyed the prolonged burn of the serranos and habaneros, but I can certainly see how this could be a turn off for some. Overall, I sort of hope that the veggie bits were a mistake and not the norm, as I found lots of potential in every other corner of this beer.
Fitgers Wildfire Lager;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Fitgers Brewhouse;"I don’t get how people can say ""not drinkable"" and then still give this beer a respectable rating. This beer has some positive attributes--the creativity with ten peppers, the attempt to give this beer a backbone, etc. But at the end of the first sip every corner of my mouth was stinging, and a lingering burn affected my mouth for minutes. The spicy nose should give it away, but in case it doesn’t, this beer is HOT, HOT, HOT. Way too hot for me to enjoy. Therefore, rating it hedonistically, it can’t be a well-rated beer. (on tap at brewpub)"
Fitgers Wildfire Lager;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Fitgers Brewhouse;Pours a clear amber with a thin white head. Aroma is very peppery with not much else besides. Flavor is Serrano, habenero, and jalepeno peppers with quite a lot of heat. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Certainly not for everyone as this is quite a unique, spicy brew.
Fitgers Wildfire Lager;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Fitgers Brewhouse;Pours dark reddish orange with white head. Aroma is...peppers! Jalapeno and serrano in the forefront, but its just a very peppery beer, complete with vegetal and spicy notes. Taste is nice juicy peppers up front, the spice kicks in and takes over from there, and then finishes fairly smoky and dry. Its an interesting beer, but it really gets detracted because its hard to drink more than a glass. Not too spicy for me but could see how it would be for some...
Fitgers Wildfire Lager;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Fitgers Brewhouse;Bomber from my sister-in-law - thanks for thinking of me Carol and Darcy!. A quite nice looking beer - very clear and bright with a nice reddish hue but no head at all. Some carbonation, but no head. Roasted peppers dominate the aroma and then I took a sip. Whoa! Think really cold but really hot all at the same time. Swish it around in your mouth and your whole mouth will BURN. I broke out in a sweat - and right now it’s -27 out. YES - 27 below zero. Light mouthfeel and a lasting burn down the throat. No Hops, No malt, the peppers dominate the entire length of the drink. Tough to rate. I could not drink the entire glass because I was sweating so bad. I like peppers - but not in my beer.
Fitgers Wildfire Lager;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Fitgers Brewhouse;[Tap] Part of the brewpub sampler in August. Pours an amber/orange color with very little carbonation and no head. Aroma of hot peppers and maybe some light biscuits. Taste is like biting into a ripe pepper, with warming permeating every part of your mouth. More balanced than the typical pepper beer though. It is one of the more intense pepper flavored beers, but the marzen character of the malts cuts into that heat a little bit. The spicy/peppery finish lasts for a long, long time. Great to try, but not sure if I could drink a whole lot of this.
Fitgers Wildfire Lager;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Fitgers Brewhouse;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear raging red, with an orange fringed and no head. Aroma is peppery, with that rubbery fresh pepper skin character. Uh Oh. Flavor burns immediately burns my tongue and throat. Searing. Holy crap. Lots of jalapeno and almond. Hot. Just hot. Again, like the other wildfire. Finishes with some unexpected hop character. Quite surprising that it shows through. Not drinkable, but fun.
Fitgers Wildfire Lager;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Fitgers Brewhouse;How do you rate this? First beer i tried at ABR. Smells of peppers, weird, huh? Really hot stuff, burns about everything it touches, including warming my gut for about ten minutes after. Very light body to it, which really makes all the peppers stand out even more. Good stuff, just not the most drinkable cause of the heat.

The taste was mostly like the mouthfeel the main thrust of this beer is the malts which were quite nice and as I said ""toasty"" there is a pleasant enough hop after taste that lingers well.

A big step up from last year’s Oktoberfest. Pours a nice harvest gold color under a thin, lacy head. Nice caramel malts smell from two feet away. Taste is full ofcaramel and dark honey on fresh bread. Thick, almost chewy texture. A touch of fruitiness, and a good sting of noble hops with a touch of American, I think. Hops round out the malty package. Like many American micro versions of this style, seems much more authentic and tasty than the German macro Oktos that get lighter each year.

Stewart's Decathlon (10th Anniversary);Bear, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Stewart's Brewing Company;Oct. 2005 rating - Poured golden color with smallish head...probably due to the high alcohol content of the beer.

Stewart's Decathlon (10th Anniversary);Bear, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Stewart's Brewing Company;I guess i am the dissenting vote on this one from the people that had it at Kennet, i found the aroma to be pretty weak, a little flowery and slightly fruity, but no spices and no malts made their way through to me. The body was very nice looking, a nice gold with a fizzy white head. the flavors were not well balanced with lots of fruit tones but again, not the kind of think i was expecting from this style. I also thought there were some undercarbonation issues with it. the aftertaste was harsh and medicinal, finishing off a very disappointing beer for me.

Pear drop, medicinal phenols and tea notes add the necessary original touches to mark the memory. The palate is full, mineral with adequate Belgian carbonation and a light citric bite. Obvious alcohol never stands in the way. Excellent!

Potent cognition using a bold, sweet ignition. The Festivities: A citrus fruit plantation is where this honey sweet incantation takes place. An invitation for full mouthfeels and smooth hop incitations. Hot but never burning, this is well-balanced for its strength. Strangely, the brewer ""promised"" me that he would never brew it again. Too bad for Delaware... Transcendence: Refusing an award."

Lunar Oktoberfest;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lunar Brewing Company;Taste: Crisp, robust, bready grain, malt, some hop character. Earthy malty nose.

Lunar Oktoberfest;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lunar Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub after a long hiatus?(4 years according to reviews) Approx. 6.6% abv for this season’s batch. Poured a hazy amber/brown tone, with a frothy, off white/light tan head and web-like, clingy lacing. The aroma had an assertive toasty malt presence with a touch of sweetness. The flavor was similar, with a noticeable, moderate hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was creamy and the finish showed some nice dryness. Deeper colored and fuller bodied than many other Marzens I’ve tried. Hopefully, now to return every fall. This season’s offering was more copper/amber colored, and showed it’s youth with some earthy, barnyard yeast hints. The body was lighter than previously, but the nice dryness was still present in the finish.
Lunar Oktoberfest;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lunar Brewing Company;This may be the first of Lunar Brewing beers without an outerspace related name. It pours a bright hazy orange with a huge, rocky off-white head. The aroma is of caramel and toast with a touch of herbal hops. Medium-bodied, the aroma carries into the taste, the caramel coming forward along with an odd citric (orange?) bitterness. It finishes sweet with the hops balanced on the edge of the tongue. Nice.

Bull & Bush Stonehenge Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout;Bull & Bush Brewery;Black appearance with a small tan head. Aroma of roasted grain, mild coffee and light bitter chocolaty notes. Similar flavor, adding a mild bittersweet balance with a light to medium body and a lingering roasty finish. Solid.
Bull & Bush Stonehenge Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout;Bull & Bush Brewery;July 3rd, 2015 - Last on the tasting tour of Bull and Bush is the Stonehenge Stout. Very dark - and made darker in the deep, pub style lighting - with a nice roasted aroma that also matches the interior. But the palate is far too thin to be like a stout. And the stout causes me to reel back a little bit. It comes across as a thin Irish stout, with an off-taste. A terrible finish.

Bull & Bush Stonehenge Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout;Bull & Bush Brewery;Draft. Pours a thin, poorly retained beige head, with minimal lacing, over a clear brown black (SRM 35) body......nose is light chocolate, coffee, hints of light lactose, minimal hops, balance to the malts.....taste is slightly sweet, roasted malts with coffee notes, minimal bitterness from the hops....mouth feel, very light watery body, no alcohol, light carbonation. This is a quite simple, light very session-able Stout. It is really more of a Porter than a Stout and as such could use a rework of both the malt and hop backbones. BJCP 6/2/10/3/5

Big roast, coffee, light chocolate, a hint of vanilla, bread, and caramel in the aroma. Taste is roasty, chocolatey, somewhat nutty, biscuit, and grassy. Medium mouthfeel with soft carbonation.

Lunar Polaris Porter;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Porter;Lunar Brewing Company;On tap at Lunar Brewing Co. dispensed to a shaker showing a black/brown hue, with a presentable layer of brownish tan froth that hung around for awhile, leaving spots & ribbons of lacing on the glass. The nose was roasted, with cocoa notes, a bit of coffee, a pleasant touch of light, honey sweetness to the malt, and a slight hint of dark fruit. Medium bodied, with fair carbonation, the taste was similar notes, bitterness that was moderately roasted & earthy, with a bit of finishing tartness & tanginess on the tongue. Comfortably drinkable, and surprised that I passed over reviewing this at some time during the tenure of a number of fine brewers, now Jonathan.

Lunar Polaris Porter;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Porter;Lunar Brewing Company;"At first I thought this arrived in an iced glass, but it was simply presented in a ""frosted"" Berghoff shaker glass. So, I can’t truly judge the appearance save for the fact that it was dark with a tannish, filmy head. Raisin and coffee in aroma, sweet & bitter but weak with low alcohol revealed late. Flavor mimmicks the aroma with the bitterness of coffee tempered by the sweetness of plums and other dark fruit. Nice and oily, semi-thick with spicy carbonation to finish. On tap at Lunar Brewing Company, Villa Park, IL"
Lunar Polaris Porter;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Porter;Lunar Brewing Company;"I like hopped up porters, so this brew’s right up my alley. Nearly black, it has a rocky tan head with brown highlights. The aroma is sweet malts and roasted malts and a touch of coffee with a goodly handful of citric hops thrown in. The hops aren’t as strong as 3F’s Alpha Klaus, but complement the ""traditional"" porter aromas nicely. Very creamy in the mouth, it has a deep roasted, sweet malt flavor, the coffee still there, with a dollop of chocolate and more of that grapefruit bitterness. It finishes on a lingering, well blended sweet/bitter note. Very nice. Lunar Brewing Company, Villa Park, IL"
Vinos Octoberfest;Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Vinos Brewpub;Clear crayon orange with a thin foamy white head.

Vinos Octoberfest;Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Vinos Brewpub;"On tap at the brewpub in Little Rock, AR as ""Oktoberfest."" Pours a clear, rich, dark copper colored body with some ruby hues. Finger-width, creamy, tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is a bit thin with some grainy, lightly sweetened caramels. A touch of grass and toast. Flavor is much better. Lightly sweetened, grainy bready malts up front before a nice toasted caramel comes in. A few hints of fruit before this finishes with a nice, light-medium grassy bitterness and slightly toasted sweetness. Lengthy aftertaste following a light body and a soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, a bit thin on the aroma and body, but a nicely flavored Oktoberfest. Very pretty looking in the glass and enjoyable."

Fitgers Hop Jack Black;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Dark Brown Coloring with Tan Head. An Interesting and Confusing Brew is the Hop Jack Black. A Nice, Almost Creamy Stout that Doesn’t End as a Stout Tends to Do, Instead Hops Climb Up From the Depths to Create a Dry Hop Aftertaste. Malt is Sugary Sweet with a Light Citrus Twinge. Nice Creation.
Fitgers Hop Jack Black;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Ruby red wine brown dark clear pour, witha creamy tan head. Light brown sugar aroma. Very yeasty and hoppy flavor. Some orange peel and angelica, with light brandied notes. Really off-style and hard to describe. Another brown palate for Mr. Hoops to display his hop-strong artistry. Peculiar strong floral smack, likely from this bizarre combo of yeasts. Doesn’t finish hop bitter, just oaky dry with a sweet tangerine tinge.

Solid stuff.

Wernecker Radler;Werneck, Bavaria, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Wernecker Bierbrauerei;Had all three of these wernecker’s at a little festival in orbendorf (hope I’m spelling that right). This smells fine. The first flavor is of beer, but then the sprite soda flavor dominates the end. seems very much like a soda. Good, but why drag down their excellent pils by adding anything?

Bragdyr Bryn Bitter;Denbigh, Clwyd, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bragdyr Bryn Cyf;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Nottm BF. Interesting commercial description there!! This was my beer of the festival and quite dissimilar to the description that’s for sure. Old gold in colour with a beautiful hoppy aroma - really seemed to be cascades for me - lots of juicy grapefruit and lemon. The taste was also excellently hoppy for a beer from UK. More citrus fruits, a long finish and puckeringly tasty. A real treat and a brewer I shall continue to seek out.

Heavy Seas Loose Cannon (Hop3);Baltimore, Maryland, United States;IPA;Heavy Seas Brewing Company;Bottle pour into nonic pint glass from Total Wine & More, Danvers. Appearance is lightly hazy, light brown-orange with light sparkle, finger-width, off-white foamy head with poor retention and mild, leggy lacing. Aroma is citrus, dank, caramel malt backbone, floral/muted candied sugar. Taste is as aroma. Palate is light-to-medium bodied with thick, smooth texture, average-to-lively carbonation and fairly dry finish as taste. Overall, this was a bit old (best by 11/6/18) so hop contribution likely muted a bit as this leans more to the malt side than a fresh batch likely would. Will have to re-rate at some point. Still, can tell there's quality construction here.

Flavor is an okay meld of orange and coriander. Would never call this a saison--perhaps a spiced amber ale. Overall, it is a solid brew.
Rattlesnake Mountain Saison;Richland, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rattlesnake Mountain Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery. This was a pretty decent beer. Only the 2nd Saison I have tried though. Opaque brown in color with very little head. Definite corriander aroma and a big presence in the flavor. The flavor was also somewhat sweet, but the actual orange was not noticeable as more than just some citursiness. Pretty tasty though.

Fallen Angel Black Cat Ale;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Stout;Fallen Angel (Closed);"Bottle at The Penguin Beer Bobbing/13 Beers of Halloween tasting (6.1%). Easily the best conditioned beer of the evening; thick creamy tan over mahogany, lacing all the way. Butter, fresh raspberry, blackcurrant and plum in the aroma. Proper balsamic zing of sour; more blackcurrant, Flemish cherry and caramel, hint of roast. Utterly baffling, and bordering on the undrinkable. If it’s intentionally soured, it’s balanced and brilliant. But it isn’t."

Fallen Angel Angry Ox Bitter;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Fallen Angel (Closed);A bright ruby red to brown coloured beer with a frothy latte coloured head. A fruity aroma, it maybe because of the colour, but it’s reminiscent of red berry fruit like sour raspberry, plus pink grapefruit. A dry mouthfeel. A tart fruity flavour, repeats the elements from the aroma, along with a dry caramel malt taste and a sour hop flavour. Not sure if this example is at it best. The finish is a lingering sourness.

Pours a dark amber, with a decent head that subsides gradually. Good smoky aroma and a strong, rich malt taste, also with smoky hints. A bit musty - I did rather over-age it - but a nice long bitter aftertaste. Worthy trying if you can find it.

Fallen Angel Hickory Switch Porter;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Porter;Fallen Angel (Closed);500ml bottle from Middle Farm in East Sussex. Brewed July 06, drunk June 07. Pours a hazy very dark brown, with a tan head that subsides. Aroma is of roasted malt, which is carried on in the taste, along with a decent smoky flavour. I think it definitely benefited from more time in the bottle because the smokiness was certainly apparent (compared to other peoples’ comments). The palate is rather thin but I can see this going well with BBQ food.
Fallen Angel Hickory Switch Porter;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Porter;Fallen Angel (Closed);Bottle at the London Gathering, November 2005. Murky dark brown colour. Indistinct aroma, with a little roasty malt and maybe a hint of licorice. Rather thin in the mouth with a distinct bitterness and a smidgen of sharp fruit. Nothing unpleasant about this but it didn’t really have much depth of flavour and was, overall, short of impact.
Fallen Angel Hickory Switch Porter;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Porter;Fallen Angel (Closed);Bottle. Cool label i have to say! This is a thin porter, with only a touch of roasty chocolate, and fruity acidity. I was hoping for a lot more in the body, flavour and aroma departments. Dissapointing.
Fallen Angel Hickory Switch Porter;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Porter;Fallen Angel (Closed);Bottle @ London Gatherying, Nov 05. Almost smoky with light roast notes. Too thick and malty too really appreciate.

Plevnan Weizenbock;Tampere, Finland;Bock - Weizenbock;Koskipanimo;"Keg (Gallows Bird, Espoo, Kekri05) Hazy brown, healthy tight head. Banana and estery aroma, becomes a little smoky after a while. Sticky mouthfeel - very full bodied and sweet. Huge fruity and spicy taste - soft wheaty base, plums, apples, and bananas, and a tang of cloves and ginger. Doesn’t seem 7%. Very decent example of the style; very Plevna. Should rerate."
Plevnan Weizenbock;Tampere, Finland;Bock - Weizenbock;Koskipanimo;Draught at Plevna (29 sept. 2005). Hazy brown color. Banana and clove in the aroma with hints of smoke and sauna. Delicious and a bit unusual aroma. Sweetish, rounded and full-bodied palate with less carbonation than usually in wheat beers. Bread and plums in the flavor with only light clove and banana notes. The finish is dryer, fruity, lightly alcoholic and acidic. Excellent, finish could be better though.
Plevnan Weizenbock;Tampere, Finland;Bock - Weizenbock;Koskipanimo;draught @ pikkulintu. Cloudy, brownish with a 2 finger head, craggy head. Apple, yeast, and sweetness in the aroma - almost overwhelmed by some smoky hints. The taste is sweet, with a lingering aftertaste. No apparent alcohol. Slight bite. A tad bit watery.
Plevnan Weizenbock;Tampere, Finland;Bock - Weizenbock;Koskipanimo;Draught @Plevna Hazy nut brown, nice small creamy tanned head. Aroma has lots of fruity banana esters and wheat. Not sweet but a bit smokey nose. Taste is like you could expect: hefeweizen on drugs. Very balanced: Plevna’s Vehnä is doped with their Bock. Medium to almost full-bodied weizen which has so much speed that when it finally breaks, you can taste some rubber. Good example of this style.
Plevnan Weizenbock;Tampere, Finland;Bock - Weizenbock;Koskipanimo;"(Draught @ Pikkulintu, Helsinki) Muddy brown color with almost no head. Strong, quite sahti-like, phenolic and fruity banana aroma - very nice. The vineous flavor is not so impressive with some harsh alcohol and some odd sidetaste. Lots of fruit, sone tannic acids and yeast, along with some sugary sweetness. Long, bitter (not very pleasantly so) aftertaste in the back of mouth. Medium-bodied, somewhat thick, ""sahti-rough"" palate, but - strangely enough - still feels a bit watery. One cannot say this isn’t a good try, but it needs some refining to be on par with the Germans. Very nice in small doses, anyway."
Blue Dog Blue Collar Mead;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Mead;Blue Dog Mead Company;750ml bottle (courtesy of Headbanger) poured into a Snifter at 45°. Color is a light clear gold with no carbonation or head. Aroma has an odd melted plastic thing going on with a hint of sweet corn in the back. It has a medium body that goes down with a rich feel. Flavor is a little honey with a faint spice note but unfortunately the plastic from the aroma shows in a big bad way. Aftertaste is sweet and as the plastic fades the honey seems to come out a little more. Overall I think this bottle may have gone bad and it's just not that good. But as I drink it and acclimate to it, I get a little more honey and it's not that bad. Still not good but not bad.

Corny-malty, acidic and soapy aroma with faint hop hints. Smoothly corny-malty flavor with a hint of aromatic hops, a quickly fading, dry finish, and low bitterness. Light-bodied, acidic but quite smooth palate with not much carbonation. An easily drinkable and quite smooth, but empty and uninteresting, corny and acidic brew. The (faint) aromatic hopping is a definite plus, though."

Barley Johns Golden Pale Ale;New Brighton, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Barley Johns Brew Pub;Not actually sure if this is supposed to be an American or English Pale Ale. Feel free to change it if you are in the know. Doesn’t have a typical APA taste to it, but certainly is more bitter than a typical English Pale. Smells like a hefe with banana notes, faint hops and kiwi. Very unique aroma. Nice, lasting, tight bubble head. Cloudy golden body. Perfect lace. Tangerine, citrus and pepper on the tongue. Bitter. Has some cask-like qualities, particularly in appearance and serving temperature. This brew is unique but a little confused. Certainly worth a try, however.

Hideout FDRs ESB;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Hideout Brewing Company;"Draft @ Brewpub: This tastes similar to the IPA... which is odd.

Minimal alcohol presence, full flavor profile. More intense than the typical ESB with the medicinal notes and big toasts. A bit untraditional, but not bad.

Amber Harde;Bielkówko, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Amber;Blind tasted with 5 other pale lagers. Beers were: 1. Dog Tag Legacy Lager, 2. Amber Harde, 3. Granite City The Northern, 4. Rammer Jammer Beer, 5. Amber Johannes, 6. Ale Asylum 12 oz. Curl. All 3 raters rated them 61 345 TIED 2. 500ml bottle. Gold pour, lots of yeast floaties. Aroma is oxidized, not much else. Flavor is sweetish bready, not as oxidized but not good. Post tasting thoughts: This was maybe the worst of the bunch, just seemed stale.
Fort Street Touchdown Brown;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Fort Street Brewery;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a sturdy milky brown color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that fell off fairly quick. Mild lace. The aroma had some clean toffee malts up front with some nuts and then some dry leafiness with just a touch of grassy/earthiness rounding it all out. The flavor slid towards the sweet side initially and then developed the dry leafiness a bit more as it warmed. Nice blend in the aftertaste and rolling into the finish. The feel was about medium bodied with a decent sessionability about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt good. Overall, doesn’t say it was an Autumn release, but somehow I thought this was. Looks like one I get to research, which I don’t mind, as I would have love to have this again if I could get it.

Fort Street Caraway IPA;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;IPA;Fort Street Brewery;Cask: light brown, murky with huge off-white head. Great lacing. Aroma and flavor very unique due to the caraway. Sort of a rye like quality, but had a residuel sweetness to it, reminded me of the sweet herbs in a ricola cough drop. Very oily mouthfeel. Very nice brew.
Fort Street Caraway IPA;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;IPA;Fort Street Brewery;On tap: Aroma is sweet and very citrusy with a rye characteristic in the aroma. Very cloudy brownish-orange with a big off-white head with great retention. Flavor is candy sweet and citrusy up front with some apricot. Moderately hoppy finish with a rye presence that must be the caraway.

Loddon Ferrymans Gold Extra;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Loddon Brewery;Cask Handpump at The Wellington, Birmingham. Golden, with no head. Slightly fizzy on the tongue, orange aroma and very bitter. Lovely stuff.
Loddon Ferrymans Gold Extra;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Loddon Brewery;Gravity @ Guide Dog Beer Festival, Soton. Masses of lively zesty aromas- citrus fruits, pineapple, mango, floral honey and spice. The fruity characteristics are to the fore with soft malt underneath. A touch of sweetness but incredibly well balanced by the fruity hop burst on the tongue. Full for a golden ale but incredibly drinkable. An excellent beer with all the elements blending seemlessly together.
Stumpys Hot Dog;Upper Swanmore, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stumpys Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) at Reading Beer Festival, April 2006. Hazy red/brown colour. Apart from the obvious chilli bite, there’s a fairly standard, malty best bitter underneath. In fact the initial impression is of the latter, with the chilli only coming through fairly late. But when it does arrive, it does so very forcefully. I like chillies and I like beer but I’ve yet to find a combination of the two that I have enjoyed. If the concept appeals, you’ll get along with this beer just fine. But it seems more like a gimmick to me. Guess its just not really my thing.
Stumpys Hot Dog;Upper Swanmore, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stumpys Brewery;Bottled. A hazy darkish brown coloured beer with a large off white head. The aroma has chilis and is definitely spicy. The taste is fairly regular English BCA with some soapiness and hints of impurities, but there’s also an obvious kick of chili. Certainly not in the nasty, nasty league of Cave Creek, but definitely there. It’s actually quite drinkable.
Stumpys Hot Dog;Upper Swanmore, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stumpys Brewery;Cask @ Reading 06: Smokey roast malts, harsh chilli burn. I love chillis, yet this is terrible. No sweet chilli flavour, just capsicum burn. Not good.
Stumpys Hot Dog;Upper Swanmore, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stumpys Brewery;Bottle (from Bottles of Botley BBE Mar 06). Bottled at the brewery - possibly by hand. Upon opening prolonged geyser of foam. Seems to be the start of an infection. The beer itself is a light golden with aromatic hops clashing with a vegetal feel but not distinguishable heat from the chillies. (Av rating given).

Dry Dock Lucky Scotsman 60 Shilling;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Dry Dock Brewing Company;On tap at the Dry Dock Brewery Tasting Room. Poured a medium amber color with a small size doff white head. Aromas and tastes of toasted malts and nuts. Thin and bordering on watery body. I really didn’t care too much for this one and found it to be one of my least favorites of the night.
Dry Dock Lucky Scotsman 60 Shilling;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Not a 60 shilling to me, this looked good at first with a amber or better yet, reddish-yellow hue. Clear and sparkling body with tiny particles in the body. Small white head recedes to virtually nothing. Light malt was the first sign. All I could pick out was a toasted aroma, light hop as well with maybe resin. Could maybe pick out a slightly earthy odor as well as chalk. There was not much to the aroma and the carried on through the taste. Initially smooth and maybe sour, giving way to a short mouth feel, reminded my of seltzer water. Very light body finished short, really not much to this brew for me, not enough flavor for me.
Dry Dock Lucky Scotsman 60 Shilling;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Dry Dock Brewing Company;tap at the brewpub. light brown yellow pour with a white head. smell is light molasses and a touch of fruit. flavor is non offensive light caramel hop flavor is there but not bitter. watery, but hell i think they wanted to brew a lower alcohol session beer. not enough flavor for me to make it a session, but not bad to me either.
Dry Dock Lucky Scotsman 60 Shilling;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Draught at the brewery. Body is light amber. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted bread/cereal), with notes of wort and diacetyl. Flavor is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. This one’s in about the same condition as it was at GABF last year, unfortunately. Odd how the stout is so awesome (and the others I’ve tried are at least better than this).
Fruita Bullrider Brown;Fruita, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Fruita Brewing Co.;GABF 2005. Body is light brown. Aroma is lightly malty (caramel), lightly hoppy (resin).

Glenwood Canyon The Rex Maibock;Glenwood Springs, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company;GABF 2005. Head is mostly lasting. Body is dark yellow. Aroma is moderately malty (cookie, toasted grain), moderately hoppy (herbs, flowers). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. This seemed to be pretty much on target for a bock, seemingly using the right hops and some pretty juicy malt. I should probably pay this brewpub a visit.
Mercury Bitter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Draught@Redbones, Boston. On the recomendation of Clark, i got this one. Its a very decent bitter, it has to said, but different to what i’m used to (in a bitter), which in this case turned out to be a OK thing. This had some nice lightly aromatic, and lightly earthy hop characters, mixed with some a slight dusty malt character. A very good American interpreation of the style, very good.
Mercury Bitter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Draft at Red Bones 8/10/06. Pours a brilliantly bright orange color with a fluffy white head. Lots of bubbles raise upwards. Nose is light dry hops with minute hints of mlatiness. Palate is crisp and very clean, was expecting some dirty english malts, but my mouth was cleansed and excited. Flavors are dry grassy hops with some light grainy malty notes. A very distinct bitterness in the finish that is welcomed but stings the tounge and cheeks.
Mercury Bitter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Tap @ Eaglebrook Saloon. Good nose, sweet nutty. Got a mealy nuttines, Pine, peach/apricot in there. Hazy brownish orange color, no head or lacing. Bitter nutty flavor, like aroma with the big nuttty bitterness, some grspefruit seeped in as it warmed. Medium body, creamy smooth mouthfeel, bitter dry finish. Nice bitte, though I remember a much bigger aroma a few years back, but maybe my tastes have changed that much over the years. Earlier Rating: 4/5/2006 Total Score: 3.6 On tap @ Bukowski’s Cambridge. Good nose, bitter. Herbal, grassy, grapefruity. Tad hazy orangy gold color. Good head and lacing. In my notes I have RTR in the appearence part. I have no idea what this means right now. Bitter flavor. Sharp grapefruit rind flavor. Metallic, woody, apple, caramel creep in as it warmed. Medium body, lite cream mouthfeel, bitter finish. Nice easy drinking bitter.
Mercury Bitter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Draught at Bukowskis, with my friend ClarkVV. Dark copper color. Hoppy, very piney, minty, medicinal and herbaceous hop aroma, fairly expressive and dynamic. Impressive, authentic, true to style bitter. The hops are very woodsy, medicinal and herbaceous, with a very mild fruit platter and caramel kick in the backround. Creamy body. One hell of a bitter. The Brits should taste this.
Mercury Bitter;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Draught pint at Bukowskis, Inman Square. Pours a very slightly hazed amber-beige with a substantial, off-white, foamy, well-retained head. Aroma has soft, flowery, lightly soily/nutty hops, fresh and aromatic, with light dough and hints of caramel. Flavor shows the flowery hops off well, with a riveting mouthfeel, low, natural carbonation, tiny bubbles and a tingly texture. Malt is complex and not overdone, while the hops are distinctly to-style. This calls itself a Bitter and actually stays true to the name. Not an Americanized bitter by any means. Light dough and sugars, a bit of dry biscuits and touch of toasty caramel. Fresh, flowery, leafy hops are only lightly bitter through the middle. Another solid effort from these guys.
Hofbrauhaus Newport Festbier (1810 Prince Ludwig);Newport, Kentucky, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hofbrauhaus Newport;Half liter at the brauhaus. Pours a clear orange color on the richer end of the spectrum with a finger of off-white head, soft and frothy in texture, eventually settling into a small, lasting cap atop the liquid. Notes of caramel, sweet toast and bread, wet leaves, earthy grains, mild spice, and copper. Medium-bodied, with moderate to medium carbonation and a malty, earthy, metallic mouthfeel. Is it an Oktoberfest since it’s called Festbier? I don’t know. They also call it an amber lager. It’s somewhere in there. Regardless, it’s good.
Hofbrauhaus Newport Festbier (1810 Prince Ludwig);Newport, Kentucky, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hofbrauhaus Newport;Half liter - pours amber with offwhite head. Nose is floral and caramel. Malty for the style. Mildly bitter with lighter. Really not much to this.

Hofbrauhaus Newport Festbier (1810 Prince Ludwig);Newport, Kentucky, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hofbrauhaus Newport;Liter draft at the Hofbrau. Amber in color with a decent head that surprisingly disappeared in no time. Taste is a flavorful sweet maltiness with just the slightest hop bitterness to balance. Very nice, but not remarkable.

Hammerpot Meteor;Arundel, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hammerpot Brewery;Bitter from an English micro with bronze colour (darker than average for the style) and somewhat toasty, even a bit smoky aroma, tobacco, dried leaves, peat, coffee powder, dried fruits, caramel, even a hint of charcoal. Caramel taste, malty, smoky and a bit roasted, bittering into leafy hops in the finish, but altogether remaining mild and gentle. Very attractive, individual interpretation of the style.

Quite dark for an ordinary bitter. Dry, malty aroma with some caramel notes. The flavour has a decent malt backbone with balancing earthy hops. Smooth but firm mouthfeel. Moderate bitterness. Plenty of flavour for a session bitter. I thought this was pretty good, even if others around weren’t too impressed.

Howard Town Bleaklow;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Howard Town Brewery;Tasted this at the Three Judges, Glasgow in January 2012. Cask, handpump dispense. Opaque pale amber in colour with a thin white creamy head. Slight touch of caramel in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and poor lacing. Pale malt gives a digestive biscuit base with notes of soft chewy toffee. Short dusty hop prickle gives a sharp bitter aftertaste. Sweet malt present in the malty finish with oak cask notes adding dryness to the mouth. An ok session ale but nothing exceptional.

Howard Town Bleaklow;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Howard Town Brewery;Cask Conditioned handpump Coach & Horses Wellingborough. A hazy orange gold coloured beer. Hops coming through the sourness as this beer was past its best. Clearly on the turn, even getting worse as the pint got lower. Obvious signs through the sourness of a half decent hoppy beer though. To be revisited.

I climbed Bleaklow in the rain about twenty years ago, and a bleak and barren hell hole it was. This beer cheered me a little more. Orange gold, slightly hazy. Sweet buttery caramel malt aroma.

Howard Town Bleaklow;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Howard Town Brewery;Clear very light amber pour covered by a light white cover. Very malty upfront, certainly cerealic in nose with significant orange tea notes. Quite aromatic hoppiness, but frankly almost absent bitterness by contrast. Herbal and perhaps going a bit too far in that direction as chamomile and leafy flavours are summoned to complete the portrait.
Howard Town Bleaklow;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Howard Town Brewery;Cask conditioned at Coventry Beer Fest ’07. Gold amber with white head. Dry and bitter beer with heady perfumed note. Flowery hops. Not one of the better beers at the festival.

Pours clear golden, not much carbonation and hence, not much foam. Caramelly biscuit cracker nose, quite malty and only a hint of some earthy British hops.

Wheat clove and yeast (dough) and banana aromas. Lemon zest flavor very acidic and activates the saliva glands immediately, with a malt body. Light and dry, fizzy. By default they will put raspberry syrup in this because of its tartness. I had to argue with the waitress to get it without. Props to Todd Hicks for brewing a rare style, but don’t add the frickin’ syrup to it and then make it so difficult to get the true beer.

Oyster Easd Ale;Oban, Strathclyde, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oyster Bar & Brewery (Scotland);Draught at Oyster Brewery. Pours a hazy honey brown/amber colour with a good head. The nose is malty and creamy. The taste is more malt and cream. The palate is medium to full bodied in structure and texture but it doesn’t clean at all on the end.

Oyster Old Tosser;Oban, Strathclyde, Scotland;Old Ale;Oyster Bar & Brewery (Scotland);A new brewery that started in mid 2003. As I was one of the eight that Silk Tork mentions, I have to agree with all he says. Lower marking from me because it is not my favourite style. Very dark for a bitter. Cask, Pigs Ear Beer Fest, East London, December 2003. [NOTE: This was as Oxenhope Moorlands Old Tosser, before the brewer relocated to Scotland and set up as Oyster Brewery. Some of the old Oxenhope Moorlands beers are now brewed at Oyster]
Oyster Old Tosser;Oban, Strathclyde, Scotland;Old Ale;Oyster Bar & Brewery (Scotland);Gravity fresh @ Pig's Ear Festival, East London. This one caused some interest. Out of eight people who tried it, no one could agree as to what style of beer it was. Dark colour. Caramel aroma. Dark caramel malt in flavour. Not a stout. Not a mild. Not a bitter. Not even a porter. A couple thought it might be a hybrid. The name of the beer gives it away - it's an old ale, but one in the style of Old Peculiar rather than a genuine soured beer. It was very tasty.
Oyster Gold;Oban, Strathclyde, Scotland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Oyster Bar & Brewery (Scotland);Oyster Brewery’s pub, Isle of Seil, Ellenabeich, Scotland. Cask. Golden with a weak head. The aroma has notes of fruity hops and the flavour is sweetish with lots of fruit notes (melon, honey and more). The bitterness is low and it’s a delicious and ale-like lager.

Rodham's Bitter;Otley, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Rodham's Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005 (last day). First sighting of a beer from this brand new brewery. Unfortunately, at this stage of the festival, a lot of the beers were either running out or getting tired (so was I for that matter), so I’m not convinced this beer was showing its best. Pale straw colour, some hay in the aroma. Dry, not much else happening..
Rodham's Bitter;Otley, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Rodham's Brewery;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - St Albans BF. A golden coloured bitter with a sweet grassy aroma, maybe uses lager hops? The taste is sweetish and a bit floral and again grassy. Quite average.
Rodham's Bitter;Otley, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Rodham's Brewery;St Albans. Gravity. Hoppy. Dry. Rugged. Messy. Not brilliant. Ho hum. What a dreary run of beers.
Rodham's Bitter;Otley, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Rodham's Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. Pale gold colour with a bit of apple, but malt is a tad stale. Don’t really like it.

Slottskällans Vintersemester;Uppsala, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Slottskällans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Huge head of fine white lace slowly subsides. Deep yellow body with lots of ongoing carbonation. Light, faintly malty aroma with strong pea-like, resiny hop notes. Chalky, sweetish taste of soft malts with a pea-like, resiny, bitter aftertaste. It’s a good beer, but I’m not too keen on the lack of body combined with the hop character, hence the relatively low rating. (0.5l bottle.)
Slottskällans Vintersemester;Uppsala, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Slottskällans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Bottle. The first thing you notice is the very nice hop aroma - presumably Saaz. The color is bright golden featuring a white head, with OK retention. The flavor is a bit disappointing after the fine aroma. It is one-sided malty, with sweet pilsner malt dominating. It ends with a pleasant bitter finish saving the dominant malt. The mouth feel is very good with fine Co2 and a slick palate.
Slottskällans Vintersemester;Uppsala, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Slottskällans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Rather sticky and sweet with lots of toffee and brown sugar. This should have been balanced with more hops IMHO.
Slottskällans Vintersemester;Uppsala, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Slottskällans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);Blond color. It looks like a simple beer, but it has a nice hoppy aroma, of hop flowers, crispy. Malty enough, with a strong bitterness, partially aromatic. A good surprise.
Slottskällans Vintersemester;Uppsala, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Slottskällans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);"light hazy golden colour under a firm white head; beautiful lacing; very metallic aroma masking modest grassy and honeyish notes; very very creamy mouthfeel, strong sweetness and a touch of late bitterness; dry peppery finish with more metallic notes - dubious and far below Slottskällans standards"
Slottskällans Vintersemester;Uppsala, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Slottskällans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);A yellow beer with a dense white head. The aroma is sweet perfumated, with some notes that reminds me of soap. The flavor has strong notes of grass as well as lighter metal and perfumated notes, as if it is spiced with something I can’t figure out. The end is dry and slightly bitter. Slottskällans can do much better than this.

Slottskällans Strong Ale;Uppsala, Sweden;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Slottskällans Bryggeri (Coppersmith);"My bottle expressly states 2009./ numrerad upplaga FWIW Good beige head over clear foxy-amber beer. Rich malty nose, with brandy-like alcohol touches; spicy-leafy aromas, like holly or even bog myrtle. Roasted, even smoked/smoked ham flavour overlying lightly toasted sweet (egg)bread. This is just perfect balance between two pretty extreme flavours. Fruity background, dried prunes or figs. Well-bodied, slick, oily, alcohol more prominent than expected from 6.7% ABV. Many thanks to Jens Duvel!"

Mora Midvinterbrygd 3.5%;Mora, Sweden;Pale Ale - English;Mora Bryggeri;Bottled Nut brown, good creamy tanned head. Hayish, a bit sweet yeasty, nice aroma. Watery, a bit roasted and sweet. Light but decent session beer - the best one from Mora.

Mora Midvinterbrygd 3.5%;Mora, Sweden;Pale Ale - English;Mora Bryggeri;Red-ish amber colour. Ok head. Somwhat stale malt aroma. The flavour is a little bit of hop and a little bit of malt but most of all it tastes like water.
Mora Midvinterbrygd 3.5%;Mora, Sweden;Pale Ale - English;Mora Bryggeri;(Stockholm Beer Festival 2005) Amber, quite nice offwhite head. Weak aroma that brings me almost nothing at all. Flavor is thin as well, with some malts found. Maybe ok to be a 3,5, but its not very good.
Mora Midvinterbrygd 3.5%;Mora, Sweden;Pale Ale - English;Mora Bryggeri;Bottled. Dark amber creamyhead. Vague fruity nose. Lightly roasty and light bodied. A very neutral beer where some roasty malt tries to fight the void created by the lack of body. Low bitterness. There are some interesting malt tones, and the stronger version could well be good, this one surely needs more malt to fight of the winter cold.
Mora Svagdricka;Mora, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Mora Bryggeri;(Bottle, Stockholm Beer & Whisky Festival, 4 Oct 2018) Black colour with dense, beige head.

Frodsham Ode 2 Joy;Frodsham, Cheshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Frodsham;Cask Handpump at the Black Horse, Darwen 21/05/2005 Clear golden coloured hoppy and slightly creamy on the palate. Some dryness and bitterness in a malt finish.
Frodsham Ode 2 Joy;Frodsham, Cheshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Frodsham;Cask@St Albans Beer Festival. Again with the sour/sulfuric green apple with this brewer. Grainy malt, some hoppy fruit (citrus) characters. I just didn’t like the sulfuric character.
Frodsham Ode 2 Joy;Frodsham, Cheshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Frodsham;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - St Albans BF. An orangey copper coloured bitter with a lovely orange marmalade and lychee hop aroma. The taste has good hoppiness also but is over dry and a tad astringent.
Frodsham Ode 2 Joy;Frodsham, Cheshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Frodsham;St Albans. Gravity. Pleasant. Fruity and hoppy. Amarillo type hops. Doesn’t take you far, but it’s a pleasant conversation along the way.

Frodsham Ode 2 Joy;Frodsham, Cheshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Frodsham;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. Amber colour. I was very surprised to see the hops used in this beer as it had a very marked clammy armpit/sweaty sock aroma that I often associate with the use of lots of Fuggles. Otherwise, it was a quite clean and dry beer that didn’t make too much of an impression on me. Not very summery in my book.
Wychwood Whirlygig;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);"500ml bottle (best before 10 August 2006) @ Christmas tasting on 28 December 2010. Must have got overlooked in my ""cellar"" for a few years. Amber colour. Drinkable but clearly past it. If there was ever a ""frenzy"" of anything in here (I doubt it knowing Wychwood), it’s long gone. All that’s left is a bit of sweet malt, a hint of fruit and a dull, papery mouthfeel. Flagged for re-rate if possible (do they still make this?)."

Wychwood Whirlygig;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);28th December 2010 ChrisOs Christmas Tasting. BBE August 2006. Still these things are a worth a try - sometimes you get a pleasant suprise. Not so here! Hazy deep amber beer. Aged malt - oxidised with some milk chocolate. Finishes dry. Pretty grim.
Wychwood Whirlygig;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Bottled, 500ml, pasteurised. Copper with white head. Slightly hard cardboard notes from the carbonisation, heavy dry malt, some burnt, chocolatey notes. A little hop, green, flowery but not enough impact really.

Wychwood Whirlygig;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Bottled. Ruby coloured with a pleasant inviting aroma. At first slightly bitter then some dryness. Some maltiness also appears and it has that signature Wychwood flavour that all their beers seem to have.
Wychwood Whirlygig;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Deep tan colour, which my wife descried as ’brown’, when I asked her again she said’’oh okay gingerbread colour’, duh. Head faded, but still manage to lace glass. Initial smell/taste of acidy kids jelly sweets. Just had u distinctive tinny twangy kind of thing going on. Enjoyed the palate mouthfeel. An okay bitter. Would have again for sure, but not my favourite by any means.

Buntingford Therfield Pioneer;Royston, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buntingford Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. The first beer from the newly reopened Buntingford brewery. Not really very golden - more a light bronzy copper colour. If he’s trying to make a crisp, refreshing, golden ale, the brewer would do well to steer clear of the sweaty sock and diacetyl aroma. To be fair, I noticed this on a number of other beers I tried so it could be down to the conditioning rather than the beer itself. Things perked up considerably on the palate. The beer was indeed fresh, crisp and thirst quenching. Some lemony citrous. Very dry indeed.

Strong fruity aroma, but not particularly likeable - too sweet. Ting on tongue and in mouth - sweet caramel tasting - again too sweet. At the end easy drinking, but not really my type of beer.

Off-dry with fruity full feel showing its strength leaving a tangy zesty hop finish, although it wouldnt have hurt to be a bit hoppier.
Buntingford Silence;Royston, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Buntingford Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense). Beer #18 at Bedford Beer Festival 2005. One of the first brews to come out of the newly, and finally, relocated Buntingford Brewery. Pale, golden colour. Initially, I found some unwanted butterscotch in the aroma, but this dispersed, leaving soft citric hops. More of the same in the flavour. Mouthfeel was a bit thin. Pleasant enough but, overall, I felt this beer was rather too soft and lacked a killer punch.

A golden coloured beer with a citric St Clements aroma. Lots of hops in the taste, more oranges and lemons. A bit of a dry salty background spoiling the taste a little although it is still very good.

Rattlesnake Mountain Harvest Ale;Richland, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rattlesnake Mountain Brewing Company;Tap – Brewery – Richland, WA Aroma – Deep deep malt aroma with very little else coming off of it. Appearance – Dark amber color, clear with a nice head. Flavor – I liked the flavor but it was odd to be a tad bitter vs sweet and full. Could use more spices, hops and other malts. Palate – A decent Oktoberfest this was a overly sweet beer with little dry finish. Overall – Just not he best beer I have had here. The beer was flat and felt it tasted old.
Rattlesnake Mountain Harvest Ale;Richland, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rattlesnake Mountain Brewing Company;I’ll agree that although it’s not “outstanding” it’s a refreshing beer.

Ok lager.
Cotswold Premium Lager;Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Cotswold Brewing Co.;330ml bottle and on draught. I can’t stand brewers offering their wares in smaller bottles to hide an often over inflated price - I aways mark down for that reason! This is probably the best lager I have ever tasted with the possible exception of the same brewer’s 3.8. The aroma is deep and complex for a lager with notes of hop, malt as well as the usual lager smell. Appearance is a light yellow with an unfortunately short lasting head. Taste wise this lager has it all and a lovely malty aftertaste to finish. Imagine a lager with the malty aftertaste of a real ale and you have it in this beer
Cotswold Premium Lager;Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Cotswold Brewing Co.;Keg. Light golden color with a big white head.

St. Firminus Blonde;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Du Bocq;Very good, just yellowish head, slowly collapsing over metallic golden beer. Fine malty nose, bit grassy, but turning perfumed rapidly. White candi sugar obvious. Dull malty taste, faint bitterish hint. Good balance, but in the way that everything cancells out. Well attenuated. Fizzy MF, medium bodied. Rather dull, but inoffensive beer.

Wig & Pen Vienna Red (VR);Canberra, ACT, Australia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Wig & Pen Brewery;On tap at the Wig & Pen. Hurrah - a decent Red at the Wig! Tasty Red with nice fruity, apricotty flavours & aroma and a good solid, fluffy head. Tastes of roasted malt, and clear hoppy bitterness in there too - a good job.
Three Floyds Surly Klaus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;"Poured out black, with no head to speak of, maybe a few bubbles around the edges. Smell was pretty much full of bourbon. As I recall Alpha Klaus had a very hoppy, yet complex nose; this didn’t. Taste was still full of bourbon, it was as if someone just added a shot of bourbon to a small glass of bland porter. Mouthfeel was the lighter side of medium with about a medium amount of carbonation. Drinkability was alright, I guess. This was nothing more than an OK beer infused with bourbon. It wasn’t necessarily bad, but from FFF’s I have to expect more than this. I’ll take the brilliance that is in Alpha Klaus and Black Sun over this anyday."
Three Floyds Surly Klaus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;I visited the brewery today for the first time. After purchasing my case and a half of barleywine, I tried this. It was dark, with almost no head, but more carbonation than I expected. The smell was a smooth blend of chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. The hops were muted, but there. The taste was smooth. The bourbon barrel has added a slight sweetness, along with some increased alcohol, although you don’t really notice it in the taste. The taste is big, but the individual flavors are hard to discern. Chocolate is the most prevalent flavor, with the roasted and bourbon characters as runners up. The once piney hops are slightly noticed. The mouthfeel is thinner than the normal version. The carbonation is low and very smooth. I drank five of these. Seemed drinkable to me. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 10-02-2005 07:20:37 --
Three Floyds Surly Klaus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;This draft brew from the brew pub poured a small sized head of foamy with a frothy top bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a semi-opaque uncarbonated dark ruby red brown colored body. The mild aroma was malty and bourbon. The mouth feel was very tingly at the start and at the finish. The yummy flavor contained notes of roasted malt vinous dark malt and bourbon. Delicious and one I would certainly buy again.
Three Floyds Surly Klaus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub. Poured hazy black color with an average light brown creamy head that lasted with good lacing. Very complex tart citrus, sweet malty and woody alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture. Full complex bittersweet flavor with a heavy bittersweet finish and a small bite of alcohol. Good more drinkable brew.
Three Floyds Surly Klaus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at Three Floyds Brewpub and served in a tulip. This beer poured a dark brown with a thin head of tan foam that quickly faded. A small amount of lacing was left around the glass. The aroma of the beer was made up of whiskey, mild chocolate, and more whiskey. The flavor consisted of whiskey, light roasted notes, and light vanilla and oak. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and lightly carbonated. Another barrel-aged beer that totally covered and diminished the quality of the original beer. Pretty average.
Three Floyds Surly Klaus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub. The bourbon just dominates this beer. I can appreciate this beer, but wish I could turn down the bourbon flavor by half to taste more of the Alpha Klaus. I give them credit for trying something new.
Three Floyds Surly Klaus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Draft at Three Floyds pub. Last glass of the keg. I freaking love Alpha Klaus. This version pretty much smothered everything that was good about Alpha Klaus, but on it’s own it’s an OK beer. There’s a ton of whisky and peat all over this thing. Scotch, vanilla and cream in the nose but it’s all being dominated by sharp oaky whisky vapors. Bitter and very dry, wood dry. Crazy weird, but not really hitting the spot for me. Unpolished and raw tasting. Deep black with a dark brown thin head.
Three Floyds Surly Klaus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Tap a while back. Pours a nearly clear rusty red color with the faintist of beige colored head that settles out almost immediately. Aroma is huge bourbon, malt, brown sugar, oak. Flavor is HUGE bourbon, oak, malt, burnt sugar, more bourbon, did I mention bourbon. Palate is full bodied, oily, resinous, void of carbonation. Too much bourbon.
Three Floyds Surly Klaus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;This years has a big bourbon presence in all aspects. A little to overpowering for the subtle compexities of the Alpha Klaus base. Tasty, but bourbony.
Three Floyds Surly Klaus;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter;Three Floyds Brewing Company;FoBAB 2006: Nose of bourbon, chocolate, alcohol, yeast and spices. Sweet flavors sugar, chocolate, dark fruit, spices and bourbon. Finishes very dry from the alcohol. Overall there’s too much bourbon, if this were toned down this would be nicely balanced and much more enjoyable.

Pierre Huet Cidre Bouché Demi-Sec;Cambremer, France;Apple Cider;Calvados Pierre Huet;Golden orangy, quite bubbly Nose is a little catty, with some notes of hay. This is the demi-sec, therefore the sweetest, least alcoholic cider they produce, it was fruity, mellow and tangy, with just a little funky acidity in the finish, and a slightly metallic aftertaste. It reminded my girlfriend of the canned Strongbow cider, although I didn’t make the connection at all. I like the more pronounced brut ciders, but this one was pleasant.
Fruitwise Scrumpy;Botley, Hampshire, England;Apple Cider;Fruitwise Cider;2005 vintage. Quite simply not as good as previously. Dry with little fruitiness but most lacking factor is an almost bland mouthfeel perhaps from a lack of acid. Still quite drinkable. 3.4 After sampling the 2004 on several occasions I noticed a slight tendency for it to mellow outs as it aged leaving a balanced but less interesting drink. Oct 05 Bottle (from Bottles of Botley, 2004 vintage). The aroma is of vibrant fruity apples with honeyed yeast notes. Bone dry with suggestions of the sweetness that was once there and a complex tannin assualt in the finish with a light but balanced acidity. The rum is apparent underneath the fruit but complements it well as a faint undertone. A mix of eaters and cider apples has in this case produced a very fine cider which surpasses the excellent quality of fruit which has made it. 4.2
Bethlehem Brew Works Wing Nut Brown Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Fegley's Brew Works;Pleasant surprise from the Brew Works. Pours a mahogany brown withy minimal head and lacing. Aroma is sweet, burnt, and malty. Taste is different for a brown ale. With a combination of malts, hops, nuts, and caramel. Very enjoyable.
Bethlehem Brew Works Wing Nut Brown Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Fegley's Brew Works;On tap at the brewpub, July 2006. Not my favourite style, but this one was pleasant enough. Rather pale for a brown ale - mid copper colour really. Fairly malty, but these are lighter, more nutty, malts and the caramel elements are not too pronounced. It also has a touch of hop bite and a notably clean mouthfeel. Not a typical Brown Ale, which was probably why I quite enjoyed it. More Newcastle than full-on malt in style.
Bethlehem Brew Works Wing Nut Brown Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Fegley's Brew Works;A decent brown ale, has a bit of a roast element to it, as well as a bit of a bitter aftertaste.

Market Street IPA;Corning, New York, United States;IPA;Market Street Brewing Company;tap at Brewpub - don’t know why they think an IPA is a seasonal style, but w/e. Actually a solid IPA, sweet malts balanced by a nice bitterness with overtones and aroma of juicy citrus fruits and great herbal character.
Market Street IPA;Corning, New York, United States;IPA;Market Street Brewing Company;"On tap 8/1/2011 Pours a deep copper color with a decent white head that leaves lots of sticky lace down the side of my glass. Smells of bitter citrus and pine mixed with intermittent hints of bread and caramel. Finally something with a decent nose. Taste provides a decent bitter ""bite."" Citrus and pine vie for attention with grapefruit coming out on top. There’s a smattering of malt in here bread toffee and caramel, but the bitterness keeps them in check. Resinous sticky mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation level. Good IPA, my favorite beer from Market street."
Market Street IPA;Corning, New York, United States;IPA;Market Street Brewing Company;Said it was a seasonal Very respectable for type if just a little this on hops and overall impact. certainly some florals. Nice head and lacing
Market Street IPA;Corning, New York, United States;IPA;Market Street Brewing Company;Sample on tap at brewpub. Mild hoppy herbal notes, grassy but clean. Mild malt aroma. Golden amber clear with foamy off-white head. Medium body with medium carbonation. Starts malty sweet with caramel and neutral fruit. Grassy herbal hops in the finish with mild sweet after and not very hoppy anywhere else.
Market Street IPA;Corning, New York, United States;IPA;Market Street Brewing Company;A well-balanced IPA. IBU 68 but not overly bitter. Faint C hop aroma. Lots of lace. Mid-mouthfeel. A light yellow colour. An average IPA all-around but that’s all they need and all I expected, and my expectations were met.
Market Street IPA;Corning, New York, United States;IPA;Market Street Brewing Company;A tasty IPA with a citrusy aroma followed by a nicely hopped character. Finish is a little short not leaving much.
Market Street IPA;Corning, New York, United States;IPA;Market Street Brewing Company;Draught @ Brewpub: This one pours an orangish color. There was a very small off-white head on it. The nose was pretty piney, but not overpoweringly so. Not too much else to it. The taste is pretty much that of piney hops. Lighter to medium malt body behind it. The taste was relatively bitter. A bit harsh and unbalanced.

Wagner Valley Champagne Wit;Lodi, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Sample in brewery - Next to nothing in terms of flavor here. I had hoped for more. Flat, limp and bland does not a white beer make.
Wagner Valley Champagne Wit;Lodi, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;This seems like a decent session. It has an assertive aroma of lemon and spices and a flavor that reminds me of lemon cascade. Unfortunately, the dishwashing liquid came to mind.
Wagner Valley Champagne Wit;Lodi, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Poured a clear bright yellow color with a nice banana clove nose. Flavor is nice and light with lots of banana, some clove, corriander, and a slight lemon undertone. Didn’t taste any of the difference from the champagne yeast, but still a nice summer brew.
Wagner Valley Champagne Wit;Lodi, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Draught @ Wagner Brewery: This was an interesting brew. It is not mixed by the bartender, it is blended and then kegged. This beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with a small white head. The aroma is a bit dilluted, but still yet pleasing. It has notes of orange, corriander, clove and wheat. The taste of the chamoagne is muted, balancing very nicely with what tstes to be a very decent wit. A very tasty summer brew!
New Glarus Unplugged Smoked Rye Bock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;22nd June 2013 Light haze on this amber beer, good pale cream coloured head.

Pours a dark amber color with very little head and lots of chunky yeasty protein. Aroma is very oxidized, sherry. Medium to heavy on the palate with light, soft carbonation. Flavor is sweet, smokey, oxidized, caramel, nutty, toast. Definitely over the hill, but interesting to try it after almost 7 years. The smokiness is still there.
New Glarus Unplugged Smoked Rye Bock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle at home with friends, courtesy of Armin. Thanks man! Pour is hazy copper with a ton of floaters. Caramel, toffee, light smoke, bread, and cardboard in the aroma.

New Glarus Unplugged Smoked Rye Bock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;Bottle @ Stephen’s house courtesy of arminjewell. Thanks! Pours a clear orangish brown appearance with a small white head with a ton of sediment. Oxidized, caramel, cardboard, lightly smoked, a touch fruity aroma. Fairly drinkable beer but its pretty dull, caramel, bready, toffee, mild banana, paper flavor. Drinkable but too old in general.

New Glarus Unplugged Smoked Rye Bock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;Sweet NG score from GhostFace, thanks again Neal!!! 12oz bottle pours up with an amber body supporting a tan colored head of foam. The aroma has pleasing bacon like sweet apple maltiness that slips and slides smooth with smokiness. If you like ‘em with a moderate amount of rauch then this one will be very very inviting at this point. OK, here goes. The taste is pretty rich with malt sweetness, sweet red apple wedge esteriness and then firm levels of bacony smoky love. This really hits the spot. Yes!
New Glarus Unplugged Smoked Rye Bock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;Back to an old ratting. Smoke and booze on the nose, but SMOKE and metal on the tongue. Way to much smoke for me seems unbalanced. No thank you.
New Glarus Unplugged Smoked Rye Bock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;New Glarus Brewing Company;12oz bottle, four pack from Eastside Liquors in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. What a strange brew! Clear copper color with a dense foamy white head. Aroma is ridiculous, an extremely smoky bacon blast overcoming all of the more subtle undertones. Flavor is similar, with a smack of liquid smoke, followed by salty, fatty bacon and a sharp finish of spicy rye. It’s good, but it’s a mind-bending beer.
Old Swan Brewery Brewers Choice Golden Ale;Perth, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Old Brewery (Australia);The highlight of my romantic evening with my wife at this lovely micro-brewery/restaurant overlooking the Swan river, was this gem I was assured was called a Golden Ale. On draught into a stem glass, cool and not cold (took me a bit to keep up with the barman). Hazy, tawny brown body with a lasting, dense, creamy beige head that left legs down the glass. Nutty, toasted malt nose with a hint of spicy hops and burnt wood. Quite malty and dry in the mouth with only a hint of toffee up front for sweetness. Medium bodied, soft in carbonation and reasonably smooth, flavours of toasted, nutty malt, yeast, lightly roasted grains dominated the palate, with an odd hint of lemon and orange zest in the back. Got the impression that this was a Nut brown ale and not a golden ale due to its dark, malty, nutty flavours. Finish was long, malty and dry, and it was easy to see why this was their current brewer’s choice. A lovely afternoon quaffer that went down a treat.
Ridgeway Espresso Grande;North Heath, West Sussex, England;Stout;Ridgeway Brewing;Pours a deep ruby hue. Small pale tan head. Sweet and sour flavors. Deep and roasty, coffee, tobacco, leather, ashen, dark toffee in the nose and palate. Quite drinkable and enjoyable, yet slightly thin and lacking in big flavors.
Ridgeway Espresso Grande;North Heath, West Sussex, England;Stout;Ridgeway Brewing;Nearly opaque dark brown pour has a thin, wispy light tan head. Intense smoky, dry roasted coffee bean aroma has some tobacco notes. Starts with a thin palate turning more tart throughout toward a dry roasty mocha finish. Coffee flavor is nice, but the sourness is unexpected and could have possibly been infected.
Ridgeway Espresso Grande;North Heath, West Sussex, England;Stout;Ridgeway Brewing;Cloudy dark brown with no head - aroma of tobacco, toffee and damp coffee grounds that have been sitting in the machine for a few days - quite sour to start - this makes way for a mild roastiness and a rather prominent and unpleasant ash flavor - burnt/stale coffee flavor makes its way in - this beer is very out of whack - as has been noted, it’s a stout, but it has sour ale qualities - mix old coffee in and you’ve got yourself one palate-confusing beer.
Ridgeway Espresso Grande;North Heath, West Sussex, England;Stout;Ridgeway Brewing;On tap...dark brown, thick, murky and motor-oil resembling body. No head and gentle, tingly carbonation. This is a very strange stout, as it is quite tart and sour - I’m not sure that it works very well, actually - it seems out of balance. Mild, pleasant coffee and cream aroma, not too meaty. More gentle that many cold weather beers, and in my opinion, lighter like a porter. OK.
Ridgeway Espresso Grande;North Heath, West Sussex, England;Stout;Ridgeway Brewing;"Poured a very deep dark ruby color with a minimal off-white head. Big aroma of spent coffee grind, tobacco and some ash. The ash aroma grows a good bit as the beer warms. Flavor is both sour and roasted with a lightly bitter dry finish. I would have thought this to be pretty odd if i didn’t just have another ""sour"" English stout."
Ridgeway Espresso Grande;North Heath, West Sussex, England;Stout;Ridgeway Brewing;Tap at Mahars... haha. Huge coffee and vinegar aroma. It’s part stout, part Flemish sour ale. Very sour finish with stout characteristics. Interesting. Once the bartender warned me this isn’t for everyone I was interested.
Ridgeway Espresso Grande;North Heath, West Sussex, England;Stout;Ridgeway Brewing;On tap at Mahar’s. Thick, strong coffee flavor. I’ve never had a beer so dominated by coffee, yet still so enjoyable. Extremely good, very surprisingly drinkable.
New South Lager;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;New South Brewing;Poured from the tap at pearlz Oyster Bar in Charleston, SC into a shaker glass. Aroma- Has a small malt aroma not much else Appearance- Looks like a BMC lager, straw yellow color. Taste- Large malt flavor, not bad, tastes better than it looks and smells. Palate- A light bodied medium carbonated beer, has a smooth finish. Overall- An OK beer, would be ok for session drinking but the flavor is not that spectacular.
New South Lager;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;New South Brewing;On tap at the brew pub. Nice true to style lager great for a Hot day. No off tastes. Beautiful gold.
New South Lager;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;New South Brewing;Sample at brewery. Light yellow pour with a small white head.

New South Lager;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;New South Brewing;Tap at World Beer Festival. Pours clear pale gold. Pale grassy hop aroma and flavor. A little grainy and slightly metallic, but a solid summer beer. Doesn’t err on the side of overly corny/sweet, but still not great.
New South Lager;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;New South Brewing;On tap at Caledonia Golf & Fish Club in Myrtle Beach. Honey gold color with white foamy head. Grassy hop aroma and flavor with a very grainy character in the finish. Decent not great, but almost any beer tastes good when you are sitting on the porch of the clubouse watching players hit over water into the picturesque 18th green.
New South Lager;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;New South Brewing;"Sampled on tap at Barley’s in Asheville. Pours a pale clear golden with a medium head. Poor head retention and decent lacing. Aroma is strongly corn with some grassy hops. Taste is grain and extraordinarily bitter grassy hops. Thin bodied. The bartender actually said ""I hope you don’t like this."" I didn’t. On tap for the BMC crowd I guess."
New South Lager;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;New South Brewing;Had this on tap last weekend in Charleston. Poured a very light gold, with little carbonation, and a thin white head that disippated fairly quickly and left okay lacing. Aroma was faint, and what was there was grainy and a little skunked. Flavor was more of the grain, similar like other cheap american lagers, and finish was nothing special. Fun to try a fairly local brew, but not much else.

New South Lager;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;New South Brewing;Draught at Barley’s in Asheville, left from what NachlamSie didn’t finish. Pours clear yellow with reasonable white head. The aroma is pretty sweet with quite a bit of graininess. The flavor is, well, Cheerios, with a bunch of dry, coarse, floury notes mixed in. The aftertaste is a tad carbonic. Not particularly exciting.
New South Lager;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;New South Brewing;draught. Yeah, this is pretty clear. It’s a little gold, but I can read the bar coaster through the glass on the other side. There is a good white head, though. Nose on this is very grainy with hints of corn and rose hips, maybe some paper. After a sip I start chuckling out loud. This tastes remarkably like cereal and it amuses me for some reason. Think Captain Crunch mixed in with a bowl of Cheerios. This is one of the grainiest, hoppiest lagers I can think of that exhibits no real bitterness. . . just paper and grains. This is an anomaly.
Sail & Anchor Brewberry Ale;Fremantle, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Sail & Anchor Brewery;Notes were vague on this one as the sample the lovely, and I do mean lovely, barmaid gave me was something I’d expect would barely fill the average syringe. Anyway, one for a re-rate and all that. I tested my taste-buds with the short sample. Burnished clear amber body with a dash of white foam atop. No aroma as the bar was full and the crowd (my swag of joys and swirls included) were getting a little lively. In the mouth it was fizzy with some more malt extract flavours akin to the ’none & buckley’s’. Blueberry flavour seems like a semi crushed mix of fruit and syrup that in the primary may have fermented out as it was a little unintegrated and ill-defined, but did show a light tartness to give it a little character. Finish is gassy and short so a pint of it may have drawn the same. Not my cup of...err, beer, so another trip south of the Swan may be in order.

Finish is malty with chocolate and roast grain flavours still present on the palate.
Mad Squirrel London Porter;Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England;Porter;Mad Squirrel Brewing;Cask at The Moon Under Water (JDW), Watford in 2011. This was always one of my favourite cask beers I was likely to see repeatedly. It was a fantastic cask stout, and maybe my mind is a little bit romantic, and I wouldn’t enjoy it so much now, but I really did enjoy this immensely at the time. Rich, great roasty aroma, full bodied and with a smashing lingering flavour.

Mad Squirrel London Porter;Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England;Porter;Mad Squirrel Brewing;Bottle at home. A great pour with a good head and a strong aroma of roast and burnt malt. The taste was bitter and burnt malt that brought forward coffee and a definite bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel was thick and nicely oily which was a pleasant surprise for a porter with a 5% abv. It was also quite thirst quenching because of all those bitter malts.

Castle Rock Bunting;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Castle Rock Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Memorial Hall, Northwich 17/09/2005 Golden coloured hoppy and slightly fruity. Some dryness in a bitter finish.
Castle Rock Bunting;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Castle Rock Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. Castle Rock usually does these low ABV beers rather well, but I thought this was a rather lacklustre effort. Deep amber colour (didn’t notice ant reddish tinge myself), with no appreciable head. Quite a powerful hop aroma but it tilts towards clammy, sweaty, Fuggles character. Not really a lot happening in the flavour stakes. Hints of dry malt and a light bitterness. Quite soft but fairly dry. A bit thin, as one might expect from the ABV. Certainly not a bursting out type of beer. Castle Rock generally tends towards paler beers an I didn’t find this attempt at a more Autumnal style entirely convincing. A decent dry quaffer but nothing more.

Kelham Island Harvest Gold;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kelham Island Brewery;Cask (handpull) Babington Arms (JDW) Derby. Having just finished a hearty breakfast, my laptop is still downloading upadtes courtesy of the Spoon’s free wifi so it’s only fair that I swing by here and rate a beer or three in the meantime, There seems to be a real desire in the North Midlands / South Yorkshire to brew wet hopped beers so it’s good to see the return of Harvest Gold. There’s certainly a clean, fresh hop feel to it, a sprinkle of watery fruits leaking from underneath the solid collar. The first mouthful runs a smooth segue from lush hop into subtle, sustained malt wash. Subsequent gulps see the hops more to the fore but there’s still an enviable balance. The only problem with a beer this fresh is the context - I need to be in a beer garden, overlooking a babbling brook or under the shade of an oak as the leaves turn in the autumnal sun. Instead, I’m in the back of a converted furniture store with the clickity-clack of breakfasters all around. Still, a damn fine beer and the best wet hopper I’ve smapled this season.
Kelham Island Harvest Gold;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kelham Island Brewery;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Great balanced Golden beer. Strong St Clements fruit, with a good clean transition into hops through the finish. Silky and smooth.

Dry, and fairly light bodied. Overall, a pretty respectable golden quaffing ale. Judging from the name obviously not a summer ale.

McMullen V-1805;Hertford, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McMullen;Spice Of Life, Soho. Not sure what the taste intention is. An Autumn ale for sure - crystal malt with apple and chocolate notes -but nothing really pulls together. There’s no meaning or integration to this ale. It’s wandering around vaguely confused, like the French and Spanish fleet?
McMullen V-1805;Hertford, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McMullen;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. This is an amber coloured beer with a heavy dose of diacetyl in the aroma. Otherwise, its a somewhat plain, standard session bitter with the emphasis on malt. Perfectly drinkable.
Back Street Dunkel Weizen;Yorba Linda, California, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Back Street Brewery (Yorba Linda);GABF 2005: Hazy muddled hue with an outstanding head and very good lace. The aroma has estery notes of banana, caramel, smoke, prune, and roasted malt. The flavors showed both sides of the style, fruity and wheaty balanced by smoky and malty. Some spice peppery notes on the aftertaste. A smooth medium-bodied brew with just a hint of snap. Pretty nice brew.

Nose of fresh pine and grass, creamy light malts and some bitterness. Flavor is clean, snappy, pilsnerish. Not super malty. Good, clean, light.
Walking Man Hoptoberfest;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Walking Man Brewing;Sampler tray at the brewpub. Amber pour with an off-white head and some sticky lacing. Smells of bread, caramel, light floral hops. A little watery in flavor, with biscuit, caramel and a hint of hops at the end. Not one of my favorites from this usually stellar brewery.
Walking Man Hoptoberfest;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Walking Man Brewing;"Tap @ the Horse Brass... Poured orange with a bubbly white head. Nose had light fruits, sweet grains, an a dab of floral hops. Dry palate, but ver full body though. Tasted of twigs, biscuit malts, cookie dough, toasted almond, a clean lager finish.

Walking Man Hoptoberfest;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Walking Man Brewing;On tap at Horse Brass Pub in Portland. It has been a while since I sampled this and my memory is fading. I’m not sure there was anything particularly memorable - a highly hoped sweet malty beer.
Walking Man Hoptoberfest;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Walking Man Brewing;On tap at Horse Brass Pub, Portland. Chestnut red with disappearing beige head. Nuts, syrupy malt. Fullish in mouth, bit of hop on end. Syrupy malt further on. Bit watery on the flavours. Some underlying hop.
Walking Man Hoptoberfest;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Walking Man Brewing;Had this on tap at Brouwers Cafe. Small creamy, off-white head that coats the sides of the glass. Dark brown color. A more spicy aroma than one would expect from a typical marzen, but this is Walking Man and we are in the NW. Hint of hoppiness in the taste, but mostly malt, allspice, cloves. Not much carbonation.
Walking Man Hoptoberfest;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Walking Man Brewing;Draught at alehouse. Peppery nose. Interesting. Hazy dark brown colour. Modestly hopped. Good but not deep flavour, there didn’t seem to be a lot going on. Rather sweet at first. Modest balanced finish, but doesn’t linger. Seems lower in alcohol than it is. It’s different to any other Walking Man brew I’ve had.
Walking Man Hoptoberfest;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Walking Man Brewing;This was by far the best oktoberfest beer i’ve found locally made. I thought by the name that it would be over hopped, but it was balanced nicely and really easy drinking. Nice toasty malts up front and a well balanced finish. Overall this was so smooth and balanced you could drink a ton of this.
CooperSmiths Oud Bruin;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Draft @ Coopersmiths. Dark plum brown colored body with a fine bubbled off-white head. Served at way too cold of a temperature but the esters and acids are just burping right out of the glass. Intensely fresh plum, raisin and nuts with a prickly and active acetic acid note. Extremely heavy and active oak presence, the wood is bright and fresh and tannic, there’s a lot of the same wood character in this beer as there is in La Folie. Hugely rich, wonderfully peppery, nicely balanced by sweet plum-flavored malt sweetness. Fantastic beer in every respect. Best beer made by Coopersmiths.
CooperSmiths Oud Bruin;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;On tap at the brewpub. Poured a hazy garnet-brown color with an inch thick beige head that slowly receded. Aroma of funky barnyard yeast with hints of tart fruit (cherry, grape) and a light caramel sweetness paired with a soft earthiness including some oak. Smooth, moderately sweet entry with hints of ripe fruit (cherry, raspberry, grape) that leads into a funky, moderately tart middle with hints of cobwebby yeast and some light acidity paired with some mild grape skin and oak tannins and a lightly sweet, lingering caramel finish. Low carbonation and moderate mouthfeel thanks to the full yeastiness. Overall, a really solid, traditional tasting Flemish brew produced by the brewpub. Good job guys.
CooperSmiths Oud Bruin;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;"This beer is a thing of beauty! It poured a nearly opaque, dark crimson-brown color with an average, creamy, light-brown, mostly lasting head. The aroma was bright, complex and engaging. It had a light malt aroma of toasted grain; trace yeast aroma of cellar and loads of sour, spicy and fruity micellaneous notes of (in approximate order of weight) cherries, dried stone fruit and raisin, balsamic vinegar, red wine, clove, allspice, wood and a trace of copper/raw meat. The flavor was moderately sweet, heavily acidic and moderately bitter with a long, lightly sweet, heavily acidic spine-tingling finish. The palate was luxuriously smooth—tempering the sourness of the flavor and making this a remarkably drinkable brew. The body was medium-to-full, the texture was creamy and the carbonation was lively."
CooperSmiths Oud Bruin;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Very dark brown color. Small, off-white head diminishes quickly. Very rich nose, very vinous, with hints of Welch’s grape juice and Pinot Noir, as well as light hints of red fruits and very mild cask wood. Very true to style flavor, which is very sour and acidic. Flavor is very similar to the aroma, with vinous grape flavors and a mild woody tone. Would have liked the mouthfeel to be a bit more lively and I wish the flavor could have been a bit more wooy, but maybe that’s more difficult than I think. Just like their Flander’s Red, this is a very impressive sour beer. They must have a passion for sour/funky beers.
CooperSmiths Oud Bruin;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Draught, Coopersmiths, Ft Collins. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is dark reddish brown. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain, caramel), moderately yeasty (barnyard, horseblanket), with notes of cherry, wood, allspice, tobacco. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately astringent. HOLY SHIT. Coopersmith finally makes a beer I like, and no fooling. I think I had about 22 ounces of this stuff during my visit, and it never revealed any weaknesses. I’m shocked, really. This is a serious Flemish sour. No, really, I’m not kidding. How, or pehaps a better question is why, they made this is beyond me. But all you need to know is if this is on tap, you don’t even have to worry about all the other stuff on the menu. Yeah, yeah, it’s not quite in the league of Panil or Supplication, etc., but make no mistake, this is a serious frickin’ beer. Well done, brewers!
CooperSmiths Oud Bruin;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Draught at CooperSmiths. Pours mahagony to dark brown with a small foamy tan head. Sour cherry, raspberry hop aroma is huge from the glass with some caramel malt in the background. Sour tart berry flavor with malt body and vinegar notes. Medium bodied and clean palate.
CooperSmiths Oud Bruin;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Dark clear mahogany with a creamy, mocha-brown head. Aroma is sweet cherries hinting to sour. First taste is a huge smack of sour cherries, one of the biggest up-front sours I’ve tasted. Sourness fades, but a moderate puckering sourness maintains all the way through. After the initial fade, some nice oak and vinous flavors come in, maybe a wine barrel? Way late in the finish comes just a touch of hops and some darker, possibly roasted malts. Well balanced, and aged appropriately without too much oak (and certainly no bourbon in this one.)

Steelhead Fugglerama #2;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IPA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Draught at RFD’s 11/7/05: Brewed using English-grown fuggles. Slight chill haze, same marigold-orange colored body as the fugglerama #1, small eggshell head. Aroma is more pungent than #1, showing bitter fuggles, also showing a bit more leafy/earthy scents. The taste is more bitter than #1 as well, showing sharp earthy hops, restrained grapefruit, some pale malts, and a touch of herbs. Light-medium bodied, light carbonation.

As the beer warms, more of dark fruits and camel come out, and all the favors blend very nicely together.
Great Divide Hibernation Ale - Oak Aged;Denver, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Divide Brewing Company;Poured into a snifter glass. Color is a deep rich mahogany. Aroma is very sweet and chocolatey, almost like a rich chocolate syrup. Has a somewhat earthy, woody character in the nose, kind of like coffee and cream. First taste is full throttle, with the richness of the beer slamming you back in your seat. Rich chocolate starts, before giving way to an amazing roasted caramel character in the middle. Mild spicy alcohol warmth finishes the beer. A very unique beer, almost like a scotch ale minus the peat, or something like a cross between a robust porter and barleywine. Very complex, but never muddled and quite enjoyable.

Bitter End Prescotts Wee Woody;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;On Draught @ the B-Side. I can not believe this is the last beer from BE that I will rate. (I can’t believe I haven’t rated it after all this time) It pours a murky red color with a thin head and sticky lacing. The flavor is complex combo of wood, brandy, bourbon, and malt. Warming and slightly hot. Improves as it warms. Very good beer. I will miss it and the Bitter End.
Bitter End Prescotts Wee Woody;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Tap. Well, this is potentially the last beer that will ever be made and served by Bitter End! I am glad to be here during BE’s last week in existence in its traditional location, and I give a tearful toast to the unfortunate downfall of the greatest brewpub that I have ever had the pleasure of drinking at. The bartender says that they might open in a new location, but that it will be in 2007 or after. The beer pours with a mysteriously hazy reddish-brown and a minimal head. Nice woody-sweet aroma that goes nicely with the sticky and sugary mouthfeel. Served a bit too cold, but I’ll forgive it given the circumstances. Powerfully malty, well-defined alcohol presence. Classy woodiness, hints of brandy; mature and well-developed, improving as it warms up."
Bitter End Prescotts Wee Woody;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Vanilla and oak shine through in the aroma with subdued bubblegum and berry-like esters. Hazy tan-copper coloured body is topped by a low, fine bubbled, tan head that recedes to ring. Strong oak flavour with vanilla and earthy undertones that blend well with honeylike sweetness. Some alcohol is occasionally apparent in the flavour. Medium body with mild alcohol warming and lively carbonation that engages the tongue. Sampled at GABF 2005.
Bitter End Prescotts Wee Woody;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Diminishing off-white cover tops the russet liquid. The wood contributes rounding vanilla qualities and a woodiness that matches the litchi, apricot and grape fruitiness with class. Let’s add, the body remains moderately filling and oily despite the barrel work while the regular’s maple, caramel and chocolate malt richness are all intact also. Quite sweet and moderately alcoholic, but definitely a nice task of integration where the flavours interact with diplomacy.
Bitter End Prescotts Wee Woody;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;GABF 2005: Muddy brown with some head and lace. The aroma has notes of oak and vanilla, roasted and bready malt, apple and orange zest, earthy yeast esters. The taste is nicely balanced with woody and mallty notes balanced by a bitter finish and some citrus undertones. The feel is smmmoth yet biting, dry and chalky on the finish. Good beer but needs more depth on the nose and palate to be something special.

Americas Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Americas Brewpub;Backlog rating 12-12-2008 (Bottle) This beer pours a small smooth light brown head that had a poor retention span, opaque body, fair amount of lacing, and a black hue. The aroma is malty, mildly roasty, chocolate, and bourbon. The flavor is chocolate, bourbon and malty. The mouthfeel is smooth and this is a medium bodied beer. Overall, for the ABV being 12% this beer is very quaffable, has a very nice flavor, and was definitely worth trying.
Americas Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Americas Brewpub;Last of my cellared 12 oz. bottles bought originally at Walter Payton’s Roundhouse about 4-5 years ago, when Mike R. was the brewmaster, and although sampled many times at the brewpub bar, festivals, and events, had never reviewed it in it’s heyday. Viscously poured to a small Czech-pils glass displaying a black/brown hue, an initial reddish brown head foam that lightened a bit to more of a brownish tan, with a bubbles & cream appearance, and good cling to the waves & spots of lacing. The aroma was bourbon, roastiness, cocoa, dark cherry, and a light creaminess that possessed some staleness/oxidation as a vanilla bean ice cream container that had lingered in the freezer too long. The flavor presented woody & tanniny tartness, dark fruit as cherry and plum, almost port qualities, just a touch of sweetness, dry and lingering hop bitterness, and still potent, warming bourbon. Somewhat past it’s prime, but still flavorfully sippable, as it brought back some fond memories of the old place, before 2 Bros..
Americas Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Americas Brewpub;2008 bottle. Pours dark and thick black with almost no head. Nose is big vanilla, molasses, chocolate and booze. Taste is metallic, tart. Not what it was two years ago. No bitter and some sweet. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy with a little bite. Heavy. Long finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Americas Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Americas Brewpub;Liquified tree roots and sap, Folgers coffee grounds, fermenting cherries, wet cigars, molten GoodYear tires, and the horribly sour flavor of bottom-shelf bourbon. Made me wince after every sip. Harsh on the palate. I love strong beers, but this was just difficult to drink.   I had to really push myself to finish the bottle.
Americas Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Americas Brewpub;I honestly wish I could rate this at less than .5. Quite possibly the worst craft beer I’ve ever tasted. Pours inky black with quickly disappating head and lots of floating yeasties, smells like sour glue and death. I couldn’t pay attention to the body of the beer because of its vinegary and unpleasantly funky flavor. Pass this one up if you see it! Drain pour after one sip.
Americas Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Americas Brewpub;Pours black with no head other than a thin ring at the edge of the glass. Rich aroma of roast malt, chocolate and bourbon. The flavor follows the aroma and is delivered on a smooth creamy palate. Pretty much typical for the style. Re-rate from my cellar. Anise turning to soy dominates the flavor now. Getting too sweet as well. On the decline. 12/11/2014
Americas Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Americas Brewpub;What a weird wild beer. Kept my attention no doubt. Pours a deep black with a very small head and some lace. The aroma is tequila, in fact we went and opened a bottle of tequila and smelled it side by side and the aroma was very similar, but this stuff was more pungent. Eventually the aroma becomes a little more nuanced with bits of smokiness and fruitiness and a good deal of sweet malt, but that tequila sticks around till the end. The flavor has some green apple right up front that fades as this warms there is a really nice bourbon note, I mean the flavor is nice, but it tastes like expensive bourbon. There is some earthiness and raisin with a good deal of sourness. There is some roasty and vanilla character balanced with a bright cherry fruitiness along with some oxidized port wine-ish notes. There are just a lot of things going on in this beer and most of them are fairly well balanced, but I simply refuse to believe that this is what the brewer was aiming for. For as thick as the pour looked the beer is strangely thin. I would love to pick up another bottle just to see if ours was some sort of bizarre happenstance.
Americas Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Americas Brewpub;Weird beer. At first aroma is straight tequila. In the flavor, it’s still there but not as much. Bourbon actually comes through there and is nice. It’s distinct from the tequila-two separate entities. Aroma is smokey, and a bit fruity as well. A bit sour flavor. Tequila is interesting, could be viewed as old, slightly oxidized RIS like a harvey’s. Lots going on here.

Americas Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Americas Brewpub;Dark, chocolatey pour from a bottle that looked like it might contain some budget chug-a-lug. A rich, herbal, caramel bourbon scent greeted my nose - great aroma. The flavor was good, but a little odd or off in some way. I noticed bourbon, grain, tobacco, and something like sour white wine. Thanks again to Adrian for passing along a bottle of this.

Wynkoop 7-Year Itch Barleywine;Denver, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Draught, Wynkoop, Denver. Head is fully diminishing. Body is dark amber. Aroma is lightly malty (cookie), lightly hoppy (resin), with a strong note of whiskey/corn, notes of vanilla and diacetyl. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Rather dull for the style, and you know that corny bourbon smell just doesn’t do it for me.

Fish Rock Red Emperor Amber Ale;Bowral, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fish Rock Brewery;330ml bottle- I’m just updating my records- A decent amber ale- Subtle hop aroma and bitterness.
Fish Rock Red Emperor Amber Ale;Bowral, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fish Rock Brewery;Tasting from 2010. Unsure whether this beer is even still brewed for this winemaker. Poured a misty, orange amber. Minute carbonation raises in fine streams to a looming rocky white head that’s well retained. Cola, cocoa and toffee on the nose with a hint of roasted nuts and spicy, herbal hops. Abridged to the aroma the cola, cocoa and roasted nut notes come through well wit a layering citrus note. Toffee and sultana front for a tangy sweet start. Dries out in the swallow, woody and husky with a dashing spread of those peppery hops. Good length, nice light body and creamy mouthfeel. Pleasant drinking. Surprised it rates so low, but must be batch to batch temperamental. Nice (33cL, BB 19/01/11, Dan Murphy’s Albany)
Fish Rock Red Emperor Amber Ale;Bowral, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fish Rock Brewery;330ml bottle. Golden pour with a small white head that lingers. Nose of caramel malts and fruity citrus hops but none of the advertised passionfruit aromas. Palate is smooth and medium-light bodied with a moderately sweet malt base balanced by a decent citrussy hop bitterness that lingers. Satisfying without being remarkable.
Fish Rock Red Emperor Amber Ale;Bowral, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fish Rock Brewery;Bottle. Orange colour, small head that disappeared quickly. Caramel/bitter aroma. I didn’t get the passionfruits. Typical caramel taste for an amber, quite bitter. I wouldn’t buy again.

Cloudy amber colour with absolutely no head at all, just a scattering of bubbles that cling to the edge of the glass. Passionfruit aroma with a backdrop of citrus. Flat bitter sour taste, not pleasant at all.
Fish Rock Red Emperor Amber Ale;Bowral, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fish Rock Brewery;"...bottle, another no-poir, but oh well. It did have a rather fruity nose, and decent hop aromas from the amarillo. Had some citrus, but only a hint. Thought it was pretty thin, lacked body and oomph. FInished slightly fruity with a slightly roasted character. It was ok, but nothing to do the ""badda-whip"" dance over."
Fish Rock Red Emperor Amber Ale;Bowral, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fish Rock Brewery;Pours golden with a small white head. Light citrus aroma. Lacking any true malt character with some citrus hops coming through. Light bitterness in the finish.
Fish Rock Red Emperor Amber Ale;Bowral, NSW, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fish Rock Brewery;330ml bottle b/b -16/12/08. Mild amber, pours nice in the glass. Quite heavily carbonated, mild malts dominated. Ok but disappointed given the write up about amarillo and cascade hops as neither seemed apparent. Reading others reviews it would seem a better beer on tap than in bottle.

Not a bad beer, but lacked the oomph I had wanted.

Red Rock Black Bier;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Red Rock Brewing;Draft at GABF 2013. Inky and oily charred malt without the astringency typically found in Americanized schwarz. Warm bread in an oven just turning from toasted to charred, a rich and enticing display of black malt without any huskiness. Fluffy carbonation on a lean and dry body. The minerality of this and other lagers from Red Rock seem appropriate for Bavaria.

Mighty Oak Maiden Over;Maldon, Essex, England;Stout;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask@St Albans Beer Festival. A tasty, and as always from Mighty Oak, well made beer. You could argue that this is thin for a stout, and you probably would have reason. What i like about this is the subtlety. Nice smooth mocha and licorice characters, nice soft bitternss, and the flavour has some length.
Mighty Oak Maiden Over;Maldon, Essex, England;Stout;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. After a number of tired-tasting delicate beers that didn’t seem to have stood up to the festival conditioning too well, this dark stout seemed to have coped rather better. Sadly, the number of dark beers on offer was pretty paltry - all too common for UK festivals. Big coffee essence aroma (think Camp coffee if you are familiar with that). Creamy coffee flavour with a touch of bitter chocolate. Soft and creamy, but with a solid, dry backbone. Becoming drier in the aftertaste. Only 4.2% but very tasty.

Aroma is soft, little hoppiness, a yeasty, malty, vegetable smell that isn’t quite unpleasant, but nonetheless reminds me of some of the not-so-great, poorly kept, under-hopped beers that i used to be forced to drink, from lack of options. Taste is inoffensive, but pretty bland. Sweet, simple malt, some slight fruitiness and not much else really, other than a slight bitterness on the aftertaste, but not much flavour. Soft, slightly creamy palate, nice smooth mouthfeel. Nice, smooth palate makes for easy drinking, but the aroma is a bit off and the taste is just sweet malt really. Not really bitter enough; needs to see some good hops."

Greenfield Ravenstone;Greenfield, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greenfield Brewery;Cask@St Albans Beer festival. Sweet and malty to start. Some green apple and sulfuric edges. Tasted a little infected to me, finishes citric and hoppy.
Greenfield Ravenstone;Greenfield, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greenfield Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005 (last day). Golden colour. Diacetyl all the way with this one. So much so that I found it difficult to pick up much else at all. Rather thin, with some bitterness. Poor conditioning could take some of the blame..
Greenfield Ravenstone;Greenfield, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greenfield Brewery;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - St Albans BF. A golden coloured beer with lots of diacetyl and toffee in the aroma. The taste is full of diacetyl also and there is a farty sulphuric taint. Diacetyl doesn’t have to bad, but with this beer it really was overpowering.
Greenfield Ravenstone;Greenfield, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greenfield Brewery;St Albans. Gravity. Touch of diacetyl, though plenty of rough hops to hide it. On the whole this appears to be a crude, poorly made beer, but - judging from the whole day’s events - is more likely to be bad cellarmanship.
Greenfield Ravenstone;Greenfield, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greenfield Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. Lots of argument on this one. So I had a re-taste and thought that everyone else was probably right. Orange/copper colour with a slight haze and diacetyl touch. Probably not totally settle, but the malt in the mouth was good. Good earthy hops throught out with dry hop finish. However, it was ruined by the diacetyl

Pours moderately dark amber brown, hazy, frothy head fades within a minute or so, thin ring of lacing left around the glass. Aroma is tart cherries, prunes, slightly oxidized, sour candied fruit, vanilla, mildly acetic, nice oak notes, big woody finish. Taste is sour, tart fruit, touch of vinegar, oak, lingering vanilla. Light medium body. Incredibly tasty still, this has held up well.
Pizza Port Le Woody Brune;Solana Beach, California, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Holy cow, amazing beer thanks to friends of GT2, bomber, caramel, sour, delicious brew
Pizza Port Le Woody Brune;Solana Beach, California, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Big thanks to Mike(grumpyoldtroll) for opening this dinosaur whale. Never thought i would have an opportunity to try this one. A- dark purple with orange tint, almost copper like. Beige head that dissipated quickly. N- over ripe sweet cherry, wooden barrel, brett and citrus rhind T- Cherry and dark fruit. For such an old bottle,the fruitness is certainly not lacking. Citrus tartness on the finish with a slight vinegar note. M- Nice carbonation with a clean smooth finish O- Dark sours arent typically my favorite style, but this bottle blew me away. No oxidation, clean smooth and refreshing. Amazing how well it lasted
Pizza Port Le Woody Brune;Solana Beach, California, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);"My rating #2600! 25.4 oz bottle, no label with a Pizza Port cap. I had the chance to trade for this a few years ago but decided to go with a Veritas 004 instead. Earlier this year Bryan lets me know there will be a surprise in his box to me. Funny how things work out sometimes. Huge thanks for a shot at this one! Deep ruby brown with an active beige head. Nose is sour raspberry, cherry, vanilla and bubblegum. Slightly woody with hints of over-ripe pear. Crisp and lively medium body; juicy, sticky then dry. Taste is cherry, caramel and oak. Dropping hints of red fruits; cranberry, strawberry pips, raspberry and apple. Finishes with black pepper and leather, last few ounces dreggy and not so great. Still quite fruity after at least 5 years, perhaps lacking some sour bite but near perfect for my taste."

All of the best beers I review start with a thanks to Brad. The list is getting longer...Ahem - Thanks, Brad! A: Murky brown, what little head there is fades rapidly S: lemons, funky, oak, vanilla T: Sharp acidity, biting, tannins, this beer lets you know what’s up. A complex beast of a beer. All this being said, the flavor is intriguing and tasty. M: wine-like in some regards, a bit coarse D: a special brew,I’m so fortunate to have tried it. I’d love to have it again. Splitting a bottle several ways was the way to go. Notes: This beer gets a 5 in the """"Sound"""" category, as it fizzed and popped for several minutes after pouring."""
Pizza Port Le Woody Brune;Solana Beach, California, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Bottle shared at the Philly tasting. Cloudy brownish/purplish pour. Lots of caramel and some prune in the nose. Good carbonation, sour, with moderate acidity. Nice balance with sour berry, so vinous, oak, and maybe just a hint of both vanilla and caramel malt. A great ale that has held up well over the years....
Pizza Port Le Woody Brune;Solana Beach, California, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Pours a purple copper with a large, loud beige head. First whiff is a heavy dose of medicinal cherry, wine barrel, funky acidity, lime juice. Acidic brett is pretty signature Lost Abbey. Mouth is high carbonation but creamy. Fairly acidic cherries, pithy, much better fruit than on the nose. Nicely integrated acid, tight barrel. Not as meaty as Cuvee de Tomme or Red Poppy (both hugely over rated beers in my opinion), with more bright, citric acids. A creamy vanilla and some strange, soft spices on the finish. Flavor is great, little oxidation, surprising really. Getting better as it opens up. Not up to the level of the greatest American wilds, but definitely one of the better Port/Lost Abbey bottles out there, maybe their best dark sour period.
Pizza Port Le Woody Brune;Solana Beach, California, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Tasting @ Home with J&C, October 2011. Bottle from a trade with tytoanderso. Many thanks Tyler ! Quite a gusher. The appearance wasn’t that nice :D muddy. murky,sewage water like grey brown, with no head. Fizzy. Tart and sour aroma, grapes, brett. Tart and sour taste, very vinous, brett,leather wood. I don’t know if i am getting used to sour beer, but I absolutely loved this one.

Evan Evans Harvest Home;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Evan Evans Brewery;Had a pint with some baby back ribs. Light copper color with some carbonation and a hoppy aroma. Taste was slightly bitter with some mild fruits. Some bitterness on the finish.
Evan Evans Harvest Home;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Evan Evans Brewery;Cask conditioned at Far From the Madding Crowd, Oxford. Orange amber with slight white head. Dry and hoppy and probably very good when fresh, however this was a little flabby and tired, quite thin on the palate. Re Rated on 14/09/12. Much better than previous, fresher, cleaner hop note, really quite decent.
Evan Evans Harvest Home;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Evan Evans Brewery;"Cask at the Brewery Tap, Derby. Amber with a thin white head; fruity aroma; dry and biscuity with some orange sweetness; and a sweet finish. Not very exciting."
Evan Evans Harvest Home;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Evan Evans Brewery;Cask at The Penderel Oak, JDW, Holborn London. This beer poured a light orange colour and had a very hoppy nose, taste was also quite hoppy and a little fruity with citric notes a little bit sweet as well, but very refreshing and crisp. This was very enjoyable I have to confess, and from a brewery I’ve never encountered before. Cask at The Plantation Arms, Oxford, 06-09-08 Pours mid golden although the light in this pub made determining the colour quite tricky. There was a white head, light fruity beer, quite refreshing and citrussy.
Evan Evans Harvest Home;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Evan Evans Brewery;A Mes rate: Cask at Baker Street JDW. Very hoppy. Great creamy nose. Orange golden body with a decent head and lace. Its all creamy hops really but jolly good for it. Citric notes as you would expect and a wonderfully clean finish. Good beer.
Evan Evans Harvest Home;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Evan Evans Brewery;Cask@St Albans beer Festival. Malty and on the sweet side to start, but balanced out by some soft aromatic hops. Soft citrus characters. Got touches of berry fruit in here aswell.
Evan Evans Harvest Home;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Evan Evans Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005 (last day). On a day when most of the bitters were struggling towards the end of their natural, this one stood out. This is a rich mid-copper colour and in good condition. Robust and well-hopped with some US aromatic influence I’d say. Citric tones. Fresh (not a word often used today) and clean, with a dry mouthfeel, sitting mellow in the mouth. Thank heaven for a Welsh brewer who isn’t afraid to use plenty of hops. Nice one.
Evan Evans Harvest Home;Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Evan Evans Brewery;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - St Albans BF. A mid brown coloured beer with a good balance of malt and hop in the aroma. The taste is quite dry and fruity. One of those beers which is nice to drink but nothing is outstanding.

Summit Station Centennial Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Summit Station Restaurant & Brewery;Growler - Turbid deep brownish crimson, thick and creamy light tan head. Nose was a complex mix of earth, wet moss, pineapple, light pine and grapefruit, with a slight milk chocolate undertone. Flavor was a bit more intense then the nose (but basically mirrored), and was well balanced throughout. Only a mere hint of 10.7% comes in late, but otherwise remains well hidden. Full bodied, light carbonation, bittersweet finish. No doubt, one of their finest efforts to date. Hope they brew this more often...
Scotch Irish Alpha Dog;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Kichesippi Beer Company;Draught (cask). At October 2005 Winking Judge BeerFest, Hamilton. Poured very cloudy orange with a minimal off-white bubbly head. Aroma of orange zest, a medley of hops, some sharp, some almost sour, lemon pledge, alcohol and detectable sweetish malt. Taste follows nose closely, builds to a strong bitter sprucey hop crescendo, nice and strong. Mouthfeel is astringent and a bit watery, but that’s the cask, I guess. Really good, another interesting and appealing Scotch Irish offering, unlike any I’ve tried yet.
Scotch Irish Alpha Dog;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Kichesippi Beer Company;On cask at the Winking Judge’s fall BeerFest 2005. Pours a cloudy orange-brown with a small diminishing fizzy white head. Aroma is primarily hops -- it smelled a little strange to me but Goldings usually do, it’s a personal thing. Although I found the aroma only O.K. the taste I loved. Strong fresh flavour of hops which is quite sour and sweet at the same time. Overall I thought it was pretty good and even if it didn’t knock my socks off it sure was nice to have something totally different then everything else offered at the festival. Many thanks to Scotch Irish!

Reepham S & P Bitter;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Reepham Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) at St Albans Beer festival, October 2005. Copper colour. The aroma isn’t too good - undeveloped malt and sweaty hops. Better on the palate, where a reasonable balance of malt and hop comes through. But the aroma is, unfortunately, the lasting impression. I suspect the condition was not great. I’ve not had the best of luck with Reepham beers at festivals, but its hard to put that to the test as they’re damned difficult to find otherwise.
Reepham S & P Bitter;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Reepham Brewery;This beer has improved beyond recognition recently. A dark copper session beer with a good nose and a full, complex flavour on the palate. The malt /hop balance is nigh on perfect, and despite drinking several other top class bitters, including Landlord, that night, none was able to better this.
Reepham S & P Bitter;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Reepham Brewery;Cask@St Albans Beer festival. NOt really fair on this beer that i had it after a Great Divide Oak Aged Yeti, but oh well. Toffee, green apple, grainy mouthfeel, thin and boring.

Barum Technical Hitch;Barnstaple, Devon, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barum Brewery;"St Albans (05); Amber with a mildly malty, mildly fruity flavour. Some earthy hops, but really just another bitter."
Barum Technical Hitch;Barnstaple, Devon, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barum Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005 (last day). For a strong bitter, this doesn’t pack much punch. Or bitterness. Reddish copper colour. Rather dull, malty aroma. Earthy hops tiptoe into the flavour. Clean enough but rather laid back an not particularly interesting.
Barum Technical Hitch;Barnstaple, Devon, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Barum Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. Deep orange colour. Orange flavours, not bad. Bood hop, some choco matl. Hoppy spicey finish. Alcohol doesn’t dominate it.

Big carbonated oily palate but felt a little small. Juniper berry and grass w/ hints of lemmon rind and something else in the flavor. A very odd taste.

Toasted malt aroma, with a full body that just puts to shame most watery examples I’ve had. Noting extreme here, but very quaffable and went great with food.
Liquid Bread English Brown Ale;Hays, Kansas, United States;Brown Ale;Lb. (Liquid Bread) Brewing Co;A big proper malty presense in this one: nuts and buttery waffles and maple flavors and aromas. Well balanced and well crafted - nutty sweet finish, toasty on the back of the tongue. Aromas of light wood and sweet maple. Well made but still a simple brew.
Liquid Bread Porter;Hays, Kansas, United States;Porter;Lb. (Liquid Bread) Brewing Co;On tap at the brewpub as No. 39 Pete’s Porter. Pours a deep brown, almost black body with a reddish hue. Finger-width, very creamy, light brown head that leaves lots of lacing. Aroma is roasty and sweet with a good amount of chocolate and caramel. Some buttered nuts, earthy citrus, and some dark fruits too. Flavor is similar. Nice, sweet caramel and chocolate with a balanced roastiness. Some more buttered nuts, a touch of toffee, and a light amount of dark fruit before this finishes smooth, rich, and dry with a light, earthy bitterness and some roast. Leaves a rich aftertaste that lingers for a lengthy duration. Light to medium body and easy drinking. Overall, a solid porter. Rich and fairly robust with an easy body. A perfect stop between KC to Denver.
Liquid Bread Porter;Hays, Kansas, United States;Porter;Lb. (Liquid Bread) Brewing Co;Ruby brown, yet very bright. Small cap of persistent fine bubbles. Chocolate, buttery brown sugar and a touch of coffee aroma. Dry slighty smokey dark chocolate flavor with a touch of resin in the finish. Just a hint of strawberry esters. Palate is a bit lighter than I expected, but soft and clean.
Liquid Bread Porter;Hays, Kansas, United States;Porter;Lb. (Liquid Bread) Brewing Co;This was the most impressive of the lot for me. Poured lighter colored brown than most Porters, with a tan head. Aroma of cocoa and nuts. As in all 8 that I sampled, this was exceptionally well made, not overdone, and no place to hide flaws were there any. Slightly sweet and nutty with a wonderful texture, just super.
Liquid Bread Porter;Hays, Kansas, United States;Porter;Lb. (Liquid Bread) Brewing Co;Medium dark brown color with some amber-copper hues at the bottom of the glass. Frothy and smoky - ull of nuts and bread crust with a good, hearty smoke residue in the finish. A classic brown porter that seems to be neglected by most American brewers in favor of a semi-robust stout-like version that’s so typical. This is something refreshing to find, a true blue brown porter, almost perfectly made. Some light notes of toffee and caramel blend so perfectly across the tongue into a slightly dry, smoky finish. I was very impressed with how well this was made, and it convinced me that if this brewery tackles big beer styles and experimental recipes in the future - watch out, you could have another big time brewery pop up from nowhere. You heard it here first.

Moor Railtour;Bridgwater, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Moor (-2008);St Albans (05): Golden with a mildly sweet flavour. Sulphur notes in the notes. Boring golden ale.
Moor Railtour;Bridgwater, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Moor (-2008);Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Festival, October 2005. Golden amber colour. Entirely flat - no condition whatsoever. Sulphurous aroma. Clean enough on the palate, but no great interest. Tasted a bit tired, which is understandable on the last day of the festival. No doubt would benefit form being served in better condition. I’ve made some allowances in the scoring.
Moor Railtour;Bridgwater, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Moor (-2008);Cask@St Albans Beer Festival. Eggy sulfuric character, watery palate, and not a hell of a lot else, not in the best condition one suspects, but this just may be the way it is, i don’t know.

Aroma is full of sweet, crackery malts, faint touches of honey, flowers and perfumy hop. Sparklingly clear pale golden color with a slight greenish cast and a very fine head.

St. Austell Smugglers Ale (-2006);St. Austell, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;St. Austell Brewery;6°, alla spina. Complessa ma beverina:al naso tantissima uva candita e profumi tipici di un dolce Appena sfornato. In bocca sembra di mangiare un panettone, ma con qualche leggero sentore fresco-acidulo che rende facile la beva. Piuttosto dolce. Una vera christmas-Ale!
St. Austell Smugglers Ale (-2006);St. Austell, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;St. Austell Brewery;Deep ruby colour with a cream coloured head that swiftly lost the war and sat sulkily as a skim of film on top of the beer and around the rim of the glass. The colour is lustrous and lovely though. Aromas of plum sauce, chutney, aged port, currants, some chocolate and toffee, but predominantly port and similar rich berry-led aromas. There’s also some youngish jammy aroma there too. What this beer does, it does well. In the mouth there is good mouthfeel in a thick, slick carpet of bubbles. What this does to the flavour is that it slightly delays the jamminess with the fruit taking centre stage and then out it rushes. Boysenberry jam. It isn’t over sweet (which is where dryish caramel comes through) but it lets you know that this is best enjoyed with a hunk of stilton or something a little foreign, blue and creamy. The finish wasn’t as long as I expected, with the emphasis on tannic berry skins, but this beer is lovely. irrespective of how long it hangs around. It holds the charms of a more mature and unattainable female acquaintance who you just fancy the pants off but hold a sentimental devotion to as well. She’s also a brunette, I should add*. *Incidentally, I don’t actually mean anyone in particular, but I do have a rather vivid imagination.
St. Austell Smugglers Ale (-2006);St. Austell, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;St. Austell Brewery;Bottle. Pours a dark mahogany body with a big creamy off-white head. Nose is toffee, caramel, hints of red berries and metal. Taste is mild caramel, burnt sugar, hints of oregano and wood. Medium body, soft carbonation. Pretty OK and kind of original in its taste profile, but not something I’d bother to smuggle myself.
St. Austell Smugglers Ale (-2006);St. Austell, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;St. Austell Brewery;Cask conditioned at Minehead Beer Fest ’12. Copper with slight head. Quite a tart note to this, fruity, fullish, tasted a bit like an old ale. It’s ok.

The confusion was caused by the release of ’Smuggler’s Vintage’ in 2009. Have dug out the archives to verify this was the beer I sampled- you can sleep soundly in your beds tonight. ""Preposterous, Turkish Delight-scented ale floating with sediment. Rose and honey in the nose, with a pungent sucker-punch of hops. Aromatic, balanced and intensely tasty"".

Ballards 25th Anniversary Ale;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ballards;Cask@St Albans Beer Festival. Slightly sulfuric tendencys, but nicely hoppy and dry citrus orange characters, and some slightly leafy hops characters, decent but uninspiring.
Ballards 25th Anniversary Ale;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ballards;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. Standard amber colour. Some lemony citric notes in the aroma. Very assertive bitterness, verging on aggressive. Lasting dry, bitterness on the finish and in the aftertaste. Austere and acerbic. I actually quite like this style of bitter, even if softy Silk doesn’t.
Ballards 25th Anniversary Ale;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ballards;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - St Albans BF. A copper coloured beer with some dry bittering orange aromas. The taste is more of the same - very bitter indeed, feels like orange pulp with has had the juice sucked out of it. Also seems stronger in alcohol than the 4.5%. Interesting.

Haacht Pater Brune;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Haacht;(Bottle 33 cl) Yet another dark brown table beer sweetened with saccharine. Flat and almost without any flavour whatsover.

Lanes Medium Cider;Taunton, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Lanes Cider;Barrel@St Albans Beer Festival. Some slight cosmetic aromas, but does have some nice farmyard qualities and lots of apples of course! As the name suggests it is medium sweet, with some quenching acidity, which makes the finish seem quite dry.
Lanes Medium Cider;Taunton, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Lanes Cider;From the barrel at St Albans Beer Festival 2005. Orange colour, quite dark for a cider. Port notes in the aroma - I wonder what this was aged in. Sweetish but there’s enormous amounts of tannin, coating the teeth and furring the tongue. Whether you enjoy this depends on whether you like tannic ciders. I do, but this was rather hard going.
Lanes Medium Cider;Taunton, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Lanes Cider;From the barrel - St Albans BF. A nice orange coloured cider with some good bubbles on the head. The aroma is fizzy, pulpy smacking apple fruits. The taste is unbelievably puckering though and grabs your tonsils , coats your throat and actually made me cough. A real acquired taste.

Burton Bridge Prestwick Pinnacle;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Bridge Brewery;Cask (St Albans 05): Very fruity nose. Copper in colour. Fruity, a bit dry, chalky and really quite boring. Almost a little sweaty.
Burton Bridge Prestwick Pinnacle;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Bridge Brewery;Cask, Burton Fest 05. Amber with a small head. Aromas are sweet biscuit malts with sulphur. Flavours are sweet pink grapefruit with sweet biscuit and plain chocolate bittermess. Soft and smooth until the dry, bitter finish kicks in. More grapefruit towards the finish. Good stuff.
Burton Bridge Prestwick Pinnacle;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Bridge Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. Silk’s comments arise from the fact that they incorrectly had this on the printed list as being made Itchen Valley at Stoke Ferry, Norfolk (which is where the defunct Wissey valley brewery was based). Copper colour. Clammy, sweaty sock aroma. Dull, bitter and acidic flavour. Dodgy condition, hence I’ve not been too tough in the scoring. Re-rate if possible.
Burton Bridge Prestwick Pinnacle;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Bridge Brewery;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - St Albans BF. A mid brown coloured beer with a goodly amount of diacetyl in the aroma. The taste is sweet and a bit apply and sulphuric. Not sure I understand Silk’s comment about Itchen Valley, especially as I though it tasted very Burton Bridgesque.
Burton Bridge Prestwick Pinnacle;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Bridge Brewery;St Albans. Gravity. Very dry and bitter. Old English hop oil. Difficult to drink - more difficult to enjoy. Listed as an Itchen Valley beer.
Christian Moerlein Hefeweizen;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;This was terrible. Tons of sweet banana in the taste and finish. Otherwise water. No spice or trace of anything else except a little bit of wheat.
Christian Moerlein Hefeweizen;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;Bottle, courtesy shigadeyo. Pours cloudy light amber with a fading white head. Lightly sour aroma with just a smidge of banana and caramel. Body tending to light, with light carbonation. Taste is lightly sour as well. Bananas show up in the dry and polite finish.
Christian Moerlein Hefeweizen;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;A nice average hefe. Pours golden with a lacey head and a good amount of yeast remains in it. Flavor is strong and goes down pretty smooth. Overal an average hefe
Christian Moerlein Hefeweizen;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;(Bottle via trade with shigadeyo, thanks Craig!) Pours cloudy light grayish amber/gold with a large off-white head. Aroma is citrus and wheat malt. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth, pretty hefty for the style. Flavor is citrusy, tangy, a bit sour, and pretty malty for a hefeweizen. I believe I was even getting some caramel and vanilla flavor as it warmed. Maybe some banana fruitiness as well. Fair, but the off/sourish hints didn’t add to the drinkability.
Christian Moerlein Hefeweizen;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;Got this one from shigadeyo. Pours a murky dirty amber with only a faint head and not much carbonation. Aroma has a nice citrus spice thing going on. Also malts, corn and grains. Flavor is also quite nice. Pretty big yeasts with mild spices and citrus. Getting some bananna in the flavor also. Aside from the flat mouthfeel I found it very enjoyable. Thanks Craig.
Christian Moerlein Hefeweizen;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;5/22/2007: Christian Moerlein Hefeweizen pours a hazy, pale amber color with an average, foamy, off-white head. The aroma is wheaty and yeasty with a hint of banana. The flavor is similar with some additional caramel wheat maltiness and a hint of clove. This beer has a medium body and is pretty smooth. This is a good beer for those just venturing into German Hefeweizens and even for those that don’t especially love the style but try to enjoy one from time to since the flavor isn’t overly banana or overly clone and not too thin in body. 12 oz bottle shared with Rob.
Christian Moerlein Hefeweizen;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;Bottle from Shigadeyo. Pours a murkey golden with a moderate white head. Faint wheat malt and fruity ester aroma, but somewhat weak for the style. Soft stale soda like carbonation, and medium light texture. Flavor wheat malt, lemon, and a wisp of clove. Finish is watery and slightly yeasty, with an distracting sourness that I did not care for. This is not a well made hefe IMO, but it has potential.
Christian Moerlein Hefeweizen;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;12oz, no date from shigadeyo, thanks Craig! Pours a cloudy orange with yellowish tinges and a very short lived yellowish head, which stays as a ring--for a couple minutes. Sweet grain and wheat, and minimal fruity yeast with a hint of lemon make up the aroma. Flavor has some off spoiled wheat sourness and lemons. Finish is more of the aforementioned nasty wheat, but seems to subside somewhat quickly. Light bodied with minimal carbonation. This is not a tasty brew.
Christian Moerlein Hefeweizen;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;Bottle: Dirty straw, moderate fizzy white head, dies somewhat quickly, leaving nary a lace. &nbsp Looks flat. &nbsp Musty pale wheat malt nose... well barely. &nbsp Somewhat wheaty on the tongue, pale, clean, but weak and nearly watery. &nbsp Better than the JW Dundees I had before this. &nbsp Actually, while the nose is somewhat boring, the beer itself seems a bit more flavorful. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate, but the wheaty aspect does give it a little bit of something. &nbsp Somewhat boring, pale, but at least clean and free of nasty aftertastes. &nbsp Very simple.
Christian Moerlein Hefeweizen;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Christian Moerlein Brewing Company;Pours a deep burnt apricot color w/ minimal spritzy froth that quickly fizzles out. No haze at all. Aroma of aged grapefruit rind malts. Nectar is quite full for a hefeweizen w/ mellow effers. Aged citrus runs amuk w/ a mild bananagum backdrop. A very malty expression with an almost Belgian character. The finish is bittered w/ a touch of sour. Overall: very earthy and too malty. Drinks more like an over the hill golden ale.
Wychwood Hobgoblin 3.5%;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);"September 7, 2018 - at The Devonshire Arms (Camden) - handpull cask. As ""The Dev Pale Ale"" - but they confirmed that it is a re-badge of ... almost certainly this. Dark copper pour, thick-looking, decent off-white head. Aroma and taste very malty, hint of prune, some balancing floral bitterness, but it's mostly about the t'ick malt - very old school and not bad. Thick body, chewy, solid cask carbonation, medium-quick malty finish, no ugly aftertaste - I had two pints."

Cidrerie Marie-Louise Foucher Cidre Fermier Brut;Cambremer, France;Apple Cider;Cidrerie Marie-Louise Foucher;I bought this straight from the hands of the producer, a nice little lady who basically brews out of her basement. She sells from her home, and from the local convenience store in town, that’s it. A cloudy orangeade, it poured out of the bottle with a massive but ephemeral head. It smelled like apple peels left out in the sun for too long. Funky! Tart, if a little acidic, it had a intense wet horseblanket aftertaste that made my girlfriend run to the hills but made me thirsty for more! It had a nice, bubbly feeling and just a speck of sweetness at first but then cuts off very dry, like the feeling you get after a spoonfull of honey. Very nice.

Sandlot Pinch Hit Pils;Denver, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);GABF 2013. Pours a clear golden appearance with a creamy white head. Weirdly corny, rich herbal, straw aroma. Grassy/herbal hoppy, chewy lightly toasted pils malty again with some corn notes. Sandlot has won numerous awards in the past, which is one of the reasons I sought them out at GABF but this one wasn’t a winner in my mind.
Sandlot Pinch Hit Pils;Denver, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Lively clear gold - a very crisp, light, and easy drinking pils, with no discernable flaws - floral and grassy hops, moderate mineral bite, clean pils malt - dry finish, with medium bitterness - very well-executed.

Sandlot Pinch Hit Pils;Denver, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);GABF 2007. Looks amazing in the glass, big fluffy white head, clear beer with slow ascending bubbles. Crisp at first in the mouth, clean, with a wonderful dry Saaz finish. Smell is grassy and clean, very appetizing. Wonderful pilsener. Maybe they pulled out all the stops on the GABF batch, because I didn’t get any adjuncts at all in this. In my mind, this is what a pilsener is supposed to be.
Sandlot Goat Rancher Pale Bock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Clear brilliant golden with a thin white foamy cap. Brisk honeyed pale malty lagery nose. Crisp flavor that’s dry and lagery bready with a mild hop tone just enough to balance, a kiss of honey, and a warm alcohol phenol finish. Sticky lingering German pale malt on the end.
Sandlot Goat Rancher Pale Bock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Clear gold pour - rather clean and subtle, bordering on overly simplistic - some off banana esters - honeyed malty sweetness - some grassy bitterness - some slight metallic notes and a touch of vegetal character - moderate acidity through the middle - meh.

Sandlot Goat Rancher Pale Bock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Mild sweet aroma offers a grapey and raisiny fruitiness. Clear, golden blonde body s topped by a low white head that recedes to cover. Raisin and grapey fruit esters are joined by lightly bready malts, herbal hops and light finishing bitterness. Overall flavour is quite sweet with some minor notes of alcohol. Light, dry, well attenuated body with strong carbonation. Sampled on tap at the Sandlot at Coors Field.
Sandlot Goat Rancher Pale Bock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Diminishing white head elevates above the light golden robe. Fruity, grapey and juicy nose reminds immediately of white wine, but the beery dusty yeast touch is unmistakable. Lemony hops and biscuity, if not chewy malts complete the wheel. Medium bodied, sweet palate.
Sandlot Goat Rancher Pale Bock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);09.30.05 Tap at brewpub. Very sweet, my first impression is of a maibock light. Medium-thin bodied, low eff. Lingering weirdness like band-aids, hints of applesauce. Seems pretty sturdy.

West County Cider Redfield;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;750 ml bottle. Pours a clear orangeish hue, very bright. A big sweet woody apple nose. The flavor is tart apples, some sweet sugary notes but more tart apples, quite dry at times. Sawdust. Solid.
West County Cider Redfield;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;Orangish with a light pink hue... smells like there is an essence of candied apples... very pretty... tart and a bit tannic like apple or grape skin... light grassiness.... very drinkable.
West County Cider Redfield;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;Pours a brilliant shade of reddish amber, not exactly a surprise as the bottle is clear glass. Perfectly transparent. No cloudiness. A small fizzy head stuck around for about three seconds. The aroma has lots of fruity apple notes bouncing around. Lots of berries, particularly strawberries, pears, mangos, lemons, oranges, red grapes, kiwis. There’s also a rich, buttery toffee character to the cider. Interesting stuff. The taste is lightly tart with a tannic bite in the finish. Lots of apple skin and grape skin with lemons, though the apple sweetness balances things out some for a pleasant overall experience. Some woody flavor. I’ve never tried this apple variety, but I’m picturing a hard, red apple with a too tart flavor. Though not immediately apparent, it’s fairly intense when you linger over it. Quite refreshing. Mouthfeel is light, but there’s a little body and oiliness to it. Tannic bitterness in the finish.
West County Cider Redfield;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;Sample poured at THE FESTIVAL, in MA. Pours a clear yellow body with light lacing. Aroma is sweet apples and light tart fruit. Mouthfeel is thin with light carbonation and notes of apple.
West County Cider Redfield;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;"Bottle. Pours ruby/amber with spare, fizzy white head. Aroma is apples, cinnamon, balsamic, pears, cookie malt, and faint spice. Flavor is heavy fruit esters with supporting sweet malt; sweet finish. Light body, medium carbonation, and low warmth."
West County Cider Redfield;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;transparent red-amber pour, large bubbled white ring. Nose is light honey and citrus, bit of heat, paper and green apple skin dryness. Flavor of more apple skin, tartness strong, overriding honey and lightly sweet gum esters. Bit thin in profile, watery carbonation accents empty skin-like profile. Very soft with fantastic tartness, though acid is a bit offsetting and thin body accents simple profile.
West County Cider Redfield;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;Bottle. Pours clear dark amber with a small, bubbly white head, short retention with no lacing. Aroma is cookie and biscuit malt, apples, stems and light earthy notes. Flavor is apple, dry straw and a very dry finish. Medium body, low warmth and carbonation.
West County Cider Redfield;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;Bought a bottle from Blanchard’s in Alston, Mass, after the local supply went dry. One of the few local orchards that actually makes quality stuff in my opinion. Alcohol on bottle is stated as 5.4%. Tackled this bottle solo as I usually do. Cork just slid right out with a muffled pop. Into my favorite Ommegang Anniversary glass. Cute strawberry on amber color. Big spritz. Lots of activity. Lingering off-white ring. Smells of cherry skins, rind, Play-Doh, & sulfites. Not too impressive so far. Taste starts out with cautiously sweet apple skins & a touch of doughy yeast. Cherries, subliminal raspberries & maybe some something like lemon-lime. A flash of malic acid & a little grass, it turns the corner & starts really drying out. Tartness grows & starts to mimic Sour Patch candy. As it warms, yeastiness is more apparent, & so are notes of apple seeds/cores/stems. Lovely bittersweet battle, loosing a bit of it’s bite & relying on subtle crabbiness as it sits. Carbonation is sparkling, but never biting. Could use one more note at the end, as it leaves you feeling just slightly empty, but it’s so refreshing as is. Two distinct instances of bitter/tart really made this enjoyable for me. My teeth are squeaking. :)
West County Cider Redfield;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;Pours a sparkling clear, reddish, dull violet hints. Aroma is sweet with apple must, but then some red skin, tart acidic hints- with aceto- slight red wine and cider vinegar mix, almost a spoiled old oxidized vinegar, like that egg coloring you use at easter, slight chemical and phenolics. Flavor is tart, apple cider, light sweetness,earthy , fruity, fake plasticy phenolic nots, spritzy and sharp on the tongue especially towards the end where it is dry but also overly aceto tartness, slight astringency as well but overall the flavor was better than the aroma was, and it was kinda tasty at some points. Ok.
West County Cider Redfield;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;750mL Bottle. Wow this is good. The ABV for the particular vintage is listed as 5.4%. Pours a clearish bright red, vibrant and cherry-like with a rim of rose-tinted head. Aroma is a blend of dry apple-skin and some applewood pith. Woodsy and fresh. Flavors are complex and delicious. Warm spice, super-dry tart skins, and long clean apple juice sweetness. You can really taste the apple. To me, it reminds me of wandering the woods for feral apple trees and finally finding a delicious one.
Issaquah Two Frogs;Issaquah, Washington, United States;Dubbel;Issaquah Brew House (Rogue Ales);Draught @ Issaquah Brew House. Pours a hazy orange color with a longlasting off-white head. Sweet fruity yeasty aroma with some spicy hints. Sweetish malty and slightly yeasty spicy flavor with some hints of orange. Sweet malty spicy aftertste.
Issaquah Two Frogs;Issaquah, Washington, United States;Dubbel;Issaquah Brew House (Rogue Ales);Same as the Eugene City Dubbel. On tap at the Eugene Rogue House. Pours a very dark cherry red with a thin fast falling white head. Very sweet dubbel with a lot of cherry fruitiness in the candy sweet start. Very big malts but dried out a lot in the finish, it kept it from being really thick and made it nice and drinkable. Nice spiciness in the finish, light cloviness.
Issaquah Two Frogs;Issaquah, Washington, United States;Dubbel;Issaquah Brew House (Rogue Ales);Decent, but I like beers that are more true to style and Arlen always seem to make beers that are Belgian in the beginning and then becomes NW style clones of said style. Not really a dubbel, but a really kind of weaker belgian ale, some light yeastiness and very light hints of candi sugar, with some citrus fruits and alot of NW style hoppiness. Hazy and kind of chewy maltiness. Bland at best.
Issaquah Two Frogs;Issaquah, Washington, United States;Dubbel;Issaquah Brew House (Rogue Ales);"Draught 100% yeast hazy with probably orange-foxy colour, like rough-pressed orange; no head left. Very perfumey, citrussy, indeed Belgian ale-like nose. Citrus, orange zest, some pale malts, and very many yeast esters; peach like. Medium bodied, slick, but refreshing enough - a dubbel? Surprising ""Belgian"", even when it might appear cartoon-like next to real Belgian brews."
Issaquah Two Frogs;Issaquah, Washington, United States;Dubbel;Issaquah Brew House (Rogue Ales);Meaty bloody scents underneath a hot fuesal toast and brown sugar chemical nose. Not as bad as it sounds, that’s just how my nose interpreted the scent - it’s still an OK dubbel. Wet palate, semi-bland flavors of wheat, rye and tin - overall very unexciting.
5 Seasons North Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;5 Seasons North;I have wanted to try this beer for years and got completely lucky that the Westside brewery tapped 1 keg! Dark brown color with bubbly carbonation making a foamy tan head of tiny bubbles. Fairly classic aroma with dark malt, dark stone fruit, molasses and yeast. Massive flavor with dark malt, dark brown sugar, coffee, and lightly tart cheeries. A really great quad and beer in general.
5 Seasons North Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;5 Seasons North;Dark color pour. Dark fruit aroma and some cocoa. Very warming effect. Belgian candi sugar flavor some Belgian yeast character. Excellent beer.
5 Seasons North Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;5 Seasons North;Draft - Dark fruit, molasses and raisins. Dark maroon with a rich beige head. Dark malts, light molasses, dark fruit and a long toffee, fruity finish. Very nice.
5 Seasons North Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;5 Seasons North;On tap at 5 Seasons Westside. Pours a muddy brown with a medium, cream colored head. The aroma is milk chocolate, coffee, some light earthiness, and cashews. Mellow sweetness, with a lightly sour and bitter aftertaste. Medium to heavy body, smooth, and creamy. Overall, this is a milkshake of a beer, but it lacks the yeast character and complexity that I would’ve expected. Not bad, but just... alright.
5 Seasons North Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;5 Seasons North;Comes out of the tap an opaque coffee brown with a minimal tan head, but this may be a an artifact of the pour. Aroma is fruity and slightly woody, about average strength. Flavor is fruity, mainly apple, with a strong alcohol bite and a hint of sweet chocolate. Texture is silky smooth, a bit thick, and subtly fizzy.
5 Seasons North Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;5 Seasons North;Very dark brown with a fizzy white head. Chocolate raisin molasses and dark fruit aroma. Chewy palate with a big chocolate and raisin taste and a molasses finish with white grape notes.
5 Seasons North Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;5 Seasons North;Pours a deep black color with a brown head. Aroma is yeasty, caramel, roast, chocolate, plum, a hint of clove, and some molasses. Flavor is caramel, roast, chocolate, toast, plum, yeast, clove, and a slight bitter earthy finish.
5 Seasons North Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;5 Seasons North;On tap at 5 Seasons North on 4/16/09 after BeerWars... I’ve really been looking forward to this one for a while... fantastic pour... deep and dark with a 2 finger tan fluffy head that fades eventually... some dark fruit and sweet malt lingering in the aroma...medium to full body which is extremely smooth... some plum, raisin and dark malts fall towards the back of the mouth... no real spice qualities like typical big Belgian quads... lots of sugar on the finish with more dark fruit... excellent!
5 Seasons North Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;5 Seasons North;Appearance: Basic black body with a small, creamy-looking, light tan head. Smell: Earthy, roasty, dark chocolate nose with notes of prune juice and a beefy Cabernet lending some fruitiness. Taste: Rich, sweet, dense flavors of dark chocolate, toffee, roast, dark candi sugar, a pinch of licorice, cocoa powder, and a red wine (which morphs into a more general grape fruitiness). Fresh-ground black pepper. Slight woody hints. Final taste of melted chocolate ice cream on the drying finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium-low carbonation. Very smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability: Diabolically delicious! This is more like it. This is what I’m talking about, guys.
5 Seasons North Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;5 Seasons North;Bottle, from Jimbowood. Many thanks, man. When I took this cork off, I was taken back by the fruityness of this beer. Nice looking deep rich amber brown color. Flavor is nice, very fruity, with a hint of oak and brown sugar. Could use a tad bit carbonation, but im sure this is not an issue on tap. Although I liked the BA version a bit more, this is still very good and I hope to have the opportunity to try others from this brewery in the future.
Il Vicino Saison Vicino;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Barrel Draught from the jug at the GABF, Colorado Convention Center 30/09/2005 Golden coloured with a hazy appearance. Strong in alcohol. Slightly dry finish.
Il Vicino Saison Vicino;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Herbal, doughy, citrusy and spicy notes to the musty aroma with some alcohol apparent. Hazy yellow gold coloured body with a low but lasting white head that recedes with some lacing. Doughy, citrusy, sweet flavour has a musty character and plenty of rich fruity tones with herbal, haylike hops and mild bitterness. Some alcohol is apparent especially at the finish. Peppery, coriander spiciness becomes more apparent in the aftertaste. Medium body with somewhat mild carbonation and strong alcohol warming. Sampled at GABF 2005.
Il Vicino Saison Vicino;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Pours a cloudy deep straw color. Aroma is very yeasty with some phenols and just a load of esters. Some banana but a to of spices. The body is quite large especcially when considering the style. The flavors are phenolic but not rubbery or solvent-like. Instead they intermingle with the fruitiness well. CO2 seems to be a lot lower than most saisons. Overall this is a very tasty beer but in too many ways it is not saison-like. In no way is the body dry, the CO2 is on the lower side, and the flavors are very much in your face instead of being complementary of eachother.
Il Vicino Saison Vicino;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Cloudy pale straw-beige colour. Big sweaty old sock aroma. Soft malts, spicy hops and a bit of sharp yeastiness. Some glue-like phenols get in the mix as well. Kind of a dusty, flat example. Tough to say if it was out of condition - it’s pretty yeasty and that concurs with other tasters here.
Il Vicino Saison Vicino;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Hazy gold pour, the head is white, foamy and mostly lasting. A well balanced medley of doughy yeastiness and herbal hops seems interesting at first sniff. The second sniff reveals a world of fruity esters, hinting at pears, pineapples, bananas, mangos… But in mouth, the spice presence take a bit more room, cumin and coriander reminiscent, so does the doughy yeast that is so sharp that it almost turns into a mellow yet long astringence. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated with big bubbles, relatively tart. More attenuation would be a good improvement as this remains quite sweet and alcoholic.
Il Vicino Saison Vicino;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);GABF 2005: Hazy golden hue with a lasting white head. The aroma is floral and aromatic with apple, peach, clove, and sugery. The taste was a contrasting sour fruit and honey sweetness with light herbal and flowery background. A touch woody and peppery. The alcohol is a bit too noticeable in this Saison. It was okay at best, I was really looking forward to trying this after reading about it before hand...oh well.
Il Vicino Saison Vicino;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);09.30.05 GABF Hazed pale yellow, lasting whtie topper. Spicy, floral without pretense. Totally unrefined and messy, but exactly what I’d want my homebrewed saision to be. Plenty dry, plenty of herbal, dried flower love. Strong alcohol retronasal punch. Peppery notes from yeast or alcohol. Wheaty. I may be the only person at GABF who liked this stuff.
Il Vicino Saison Vicino;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);(GABF05) Hazy straw body with white head. Aroma is medium sweet, banana, clove. Taste is medium sweet, candi sugar, some alcohol, light banana. Medium0full body with too much alcohol.
Barley Brothers Double Espresso Stout;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Stout - Imperial;Barley Brothers Brewery and Grill;GABF 2011. Heavy dark with a fading tan head.

Rocky River Pilgrim Pumpkin;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);(GABF05) Crystal clear apple juice body with white head. Aroma is medium sweet, pumpkin, nutmeg, herb. Taste is medium sweet, pumpkin, nutmeg, some caramel. Light-medium body, with low carbonation and a bit of stickiness. A nice beer that does not try to bludgeon you with pumpkin.
Natty Greene's Tarheel Tarwebier;Greensboro, North Carolina, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Natty Greene's Pub & Brewing Company;I really enjoyed this unusual ale and would’ve picked up a growler for my wheat lovin’ buddy frankenkitty if I was going to get home sooner. It pours a deep, deep amber body with a creamy beige head. One of the spiciest noses I’ve encountered in a long time other than American Christmas ales and pumpkin beers. A strong, fresh banana smell is blended with clove, mint, mace, and pine needles. A soft caramel is added to the flavor, but the fruit (some apples & pears jumping in) and spices dominate. You’re left with the feeling that you’ve just chewed and swallowed some spicy cookies and a slice of fruitcake. On tap at the Natty Greene’s Pub & Brewing Company, Greensboro, NC.
Natty Greene's Tarheel Tarwebier;Greensboro, North Carolina, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Natty Greene's Pub & Brewing Company;Sampled at Brewgrass Fest. Very unusual but tasty beer. Color was chestnut brown with a cream colored head. Nice lacing. Aroma was slightly yeasty, and seemen to have somestrange spices in with some malts. The flavor seemed to me to be almost like a brown ale profile, with some spices (couldn’t tell which ones) thrown in.
Natty Greene's Tarheel Tarwebier;Greensboro, North Carolina, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Natty Greene's Pub & Brewing Company;Sampled at the 10th annual Brewgrass festival in Ashville. Chestnut with amber hints. Foamy, lasting, off white head. Looks creamy. Sweet fruit aroma of apple and cherries. Perhaps some malt, but it is light and secondary. Sour hints that remind you of Flemish sour. The taste has a lovely light sweetness that is fruity in nature and well balanced grain/wheat holding it together and allowing the fruit to make an impression as opposed to stomping you in the mouth. Any sour hints are just that, hints. It’s more present in the aroma. Light body. Really the surprise of the day for me at this festival. Very enjoyable.
Natty Greene's Tarheel Tarwebier;Greensboro, North Carolina, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Natty Greene's Pub & Brewing Company;Pour is light amber with a thin tan head...smell is roasty with some yeast...wheat is in the flavor...they say it has brett and all kinds of other goodness in it...not that I can find...
Natty Greene's Tarheel Tarwebier;Greensboro, North Carolina, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Natty Greene's Pub & Brewing Company;(GABF05) Clear dark amber body with off-white head. Aroma is medium sweet, wheat, some Belgian yeast, light smoke. Taste is moderately sweet, Belgian yeast, some candi sugar, wheat, bit of smoke. Light body, some tartness.

Great Northern Saison;Fargo, North Dakota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Northern Brewery and Restaurant;GABF ’05. Really was hoping to get to this brewpub, but it dosent look like that’s going to happen now, so here goes… Initially somewhat hazy, the brass-lemon yellow beer settles out to a higher clarity, with a slight glassiness to it. Head is white, foamy and small, leaving pinches of lace here and there, but not showing the best of retention. Simple nose, that has been done before and will be done again. Mainly a combination of banana esters and dry wheat giving a lightly sweet, somewhat creamy smoothness to the aroma. Herbs/spices dance in the background somewhat aggressively (coriander, white pepper, ginger) and sandwiched in the middle is some fluffy pils malt doughiness. Wheat builds up on the nose, drying/dulling things and there must be some dullness from the herbs and yeast. Lots of mineral-like paperiness and a fair astringency on the end as well. No alcohol noted, not overly clean, though with the herbs and spices muddling the beer, you can’t be too sure what all is going on. Vanilla-dipped bananas open up the hefeweizen-like flavor, as a rather bland, minimal, under-extracted malt adds some watery grain notes. Sweet ginger and spicy coriander attack the palate on the finish and then the beer is done before you even knew what hit you. Slight wheat sourness and herb/spice astringency linger on. Carbonation is moderate, but rather loose, while the beer has a watery texture. They certainly didnt care to highlight the malts in this beer, which is a shame. And the yeast is outdone, vastly, by the spicing.
Great Northern Saison;Fargo, North Dakota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Northern Brewery and Restaurant;Fading white cover mounts a clear gold hue. Fairly subtle aromas focus on added spices and esters, though taking little turnabouts to hints at ryeish malt and floral hallertauer. Quickly, banana and mango become the center of attention, an ephemeral situation once the ginger and coriander kick in and dominate until the finish. Not the most originally spiced saison obviously, intimately American, though with detours (like a solvent note I don’t know what to think about and an out of place woodiness). Vague effervescence, unfocused and leaving a stale airy palate. Anyway, a saison from North Dakota, you couldn’t expect a new Dupont, eh? beat that!
Great Northern Saison;Fargo, North Dakota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Northern Brewery and Restaurant;GABF 05. Pours a solid gold with an earthy aroma. Flavor is too apprehensive, with faint earth tones and subdued sweetness. Palate is a bit on the watery side. This could be a great saison with some tweaking (read: increasing) of the ingredients.
Great Northern Saison;Fargo, North Dakota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Northern Brewery and Restaurant;GABF 2005: Golden hue with a small head. The nose displays a floral and heathery character with some cardamom, sage and clove. Banana and earthy esters as well. The taste starts twangy (perhaps some brett?) and lemony with flowery and bready undertones. A bit spicy, peppery, and touch bitter on the finish. Lively and crisp on the palate, refreshing as per the style. I liked it, not too bad for my first North Dakota offering.
Great Northern Saison;Fargo, North Dakota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Northern Brewery and Restaurant;GABF 2005. Body is hazy medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), with notes of banana and clove. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter.

Fordham & Dominion Old Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Old Ale;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;I was truly impressed by this beer. Quite fruity with some pronounced sweetness, ending with a bit of alcohol and a very late bitterness. Old Ale in my experience is often expressed as chewy, thicker, earthy, with a dirty fruitiness. This is quite the opposite--clean bright fruit and a light body. Very good.
Montgomery Summerfest Lager;Montgomery, Alabama, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Montgomery Brewing Company (AL);Honey amber, clingy head. Buttery lager and malt aroma. Very nice Saazy hop zip, middle and late acidity with a substantial trailing hop presence. Medium to medium-light body. This may actually be a Bohemian Pilsener. Dryish, with a light biscuity sweetness. No time for food this trip, but I expect this would be good with most anything.

Iron Springs Epiphany Ale;Fairfax, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Iron Springs Pub and Brewery;Deep amber color light head floating in the center. Smells like hops and wood. A bitter hop flavor that the malts try to cover up but the hops fight thier way back out.

Slight minerality and malt smell Taste: very refreshing beer. Can taste minerality and light malts ! Very MIld hop aroma which could be slightly stronger in my opinion whilst still remaining in style! Overall a nice pale ale, but just lacking a bit of hop presence for me
Meantime Pale Ale;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Keg. A pleasant lunchtime pint, that had a good flavour - once it had warmed up a bit as it was served way too cold - and a pleasant mouthfeel.

Healthy Brew Strong Stout;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;Healthy Brew;Have to agree with Legion. This stuff is AWFUL. What is this brewer thinking? Did they use Lake Worth water to brew it?
Healthy Brew Strong Stout;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;Healthy Brew;FU Peter & Lumpy. Beer pours almost opaque with an off white retained head. Aroma is chocolate and coffee. Initial flavor is a little odd, grape juicy, but the finish is really nice, big coffee finish and delicous. If you are not from this area, you don’t know how mush of a miracle it is that a decent stout is being brewed on the shores of Lake Worth. Unbelievable.
Healthy Brew Strong Stout;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;Healthy Brew;FU TAD. Draft is deep red and tobacco brown. Nose is chocolate and coffe with a light oak note. Flavour is complete coffee, lactose is present, providing a flat cola sweetness. Mouth is watery at first, but fils out. Some amazing Hippy Piss (organic) from Lake Worth Texas.
Healthy Brew Strong Stout;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;Healthy Brew;HAHA. This one is already in the system-FU TAD! (Tad understands). Almost opaqhue body with red edges. Nose-very flat and creamy. Taste upfront is all coffee, coco, milk sugar, light cream. Grape and flat cola really come out as it warms. Surprisingly good! The only big drawback is the reserved nose.
Healthy Brew Strong Stout;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Stout - Dry;Healthy Brew;One of the worst beers I have ever had. Tasted like I was sucking on an iron bar it was so metallic. I will revisit later to see if I go tthe bottom of the keg or something. Nice nose though.

North Coast Cru dOr;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;North Coast Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours very hazy dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Spotty wisps of foamy lacing cling on the glass. Aromas of raisin, prune, caramel, toffee, toast, chocolate, dark bread, earth, and light yeast spiciness. Nice aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of raisin, prune, toffee, caramel, toast, chocolate, earth, bread, and light yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, toffee, caramel, toast, chocolate, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of flavors; nicely robust with zero cloying flavors on the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Belgian dark ale. Nice complexity, balance, and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."
North Coast Cru dOr;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;North Coast Brewing Company;Bottle. Interesting brew. Seemed like a lot going on. Some moleasses, dark fruit esters, chocolate, some floral aromas and bread. The blend was off, but not horrile.
North Coast Cru dOr;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;North Coast Brewing Company;A hazed brown ale with a thin brown head.

North Coast Cru dOr;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;North Coast Brewing Company;Huge thanks to match1112 for this treat. Not sure what the vintage is but he told me that the beer has a few years on it. Poured from 12oz bottle to Duvel over-sized tulip glass: Pours a hazy caramel brown with a finger or two of tannish head that receeds to one side of the glass, no real collar but still a slight bit of lacing. Big toffee and dates on the nose. Some mushy cherries and red grapes. Very smooth and no detectable oxidation or booze presence. Those bright fruits have settled down quite a bit. Some figs, a very slight cardboard taste that lingers - just barely noticeable. Pretty dry finish. It seems as though the beer has lost nearly all its carbonation. Just enough to produce a short-lived head. Never thought I’d get the chance to try this beer - thanks very much Matt!
North Coast Cru dOr;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;North Coast Brewing Company;355mL thanks to brainlair. Clear, deep ruby with a larger yellowish head with good retention. No lace really. Very malty, heavier nose with barleywine toffee and caramel nose. Surprisingly similar to Old Stock. Taste is watery, void, pretty bland. Palate is soapy, empty. Very odd.
North Coast Cru dOr;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;North Coast Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Pours amber with an off-white head. Candied fruit aroma, berry, cherry, banana, and bubble gum. Flavor immediately reminds me of cotton candy, sugary with banana, berry, caramel, toffee, raisin. Actually unique and quite nice.

Bristol Warning Sign Eisbock - 2005;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Bristol Brewing Company;Bartender lady said that this was 15%, but if it is, it is the lightest 15% beer I’ve ever had, easily.

Bristol Warning Sign Eisbock - 2005;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Bristol Brewing Company;Sampled from draught at the Brewers Supply Group GABF Kickoff Party in Denver. Nice clear amber-chestnut body with a persistent filmy beige head. Unexpected but interesting sour cherry elements. Lots of oxidation. For an eisbock, this has dull malt qualities and significant bitterness. Medium-low sourness. Fair and interesting but almost seems like a funky mistake.

Sandlot Irish Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Toffee, caramel, chocolate aromas are not exactly what I’d expect from a dry stout. Opaque brown body with a low tan head that recedes to ring. Toffee is dominant in the sweet flavour also with only a hint of roastiness in the lasting, sweet finish. Medium body with low carbonation. Seems far too sweet and somewhat cloying especially for a dry stout. Sampled on tap at the Sandlot at Coors Field.
Sandlot Irish Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Tap at brewery. Pours a lifeless, flat, and dark with an aroma of vinegar. Flavor is nice chocolate and roasted malt. Palate is a bit watery, but it coats.

Would never have sampled were it not for the name and getting a medal I imagine.

There’s a Coors connection?!?! Can a clue be hand delivered?
Sandlot Most Beer Judges Are Bone Heads;Denver, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);GABF 2005. I had about 3-4 samples of this because it was so good. It won silver for european style pilsner (whatever the hell that means) It was actually kinda a blend between a german pils and czech pils. Nice and crisp with a good amount of hops, yet still lots of bready pils malt. Perfectly clear with a nice white lasting head. Aroma has a lot of noble hoppiness to it but not overly so like prima. Good amount of malt background like a fresh urquell. Very well rounded flavors and mouthfeel. Very nice.

Silver City Wonderland (Winter Bock);Bremerton, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Silver City Brewery;20-Feb-14 (22-oz bottle: Obtained in trade with Larry Pitonka, aka 5000, thanks André!) Bock beers don't age well, but this being darker has allowed it to age more gracefully. It's medium-brown in the glass, with good clarity and half an inch of tan head that settles to a thin rim. The nose is very malty, with chocolate, fudge, and toasted bread, with earth and shitake mushrooms in the background. The flavors are similar, with milk chocolate, brown sugar, toast, prune, wort, and some of that ever-elusive melanoidin character, but the earthy, mushroomy character is lighter than in the aroma. It's full bodied and sweet, but not heavy, sticky, or cloying, and carbonation is medium. Overall, this is a very tasty beer that stands out because it's showing more than a passing resemblance to German examples. Really enjoyable!
Silver City Wonderland (Winter Bock);Bremerton, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Silver City Brewery;Slightly sweet aroma with biscuit/cracker notes. Malty up front, caramel/toffee and toast. Medium bodied, bordering on creamy. A little bit of chocolate and roast malt flavor gives this mostly sweet clean brew a winter vibe. Nice tasting brew, but I would expect this one at Octoberfest before Christmas.
Silver City Wonderland (Winter Bock);Bremerton, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Silver City Brewery;Draft pour pint at Frankies Pizza. I remember looking for this style way harder than i needed to. Very unique, and this one is no exception. Pours a dark ruby tinted brown with a rocky foam head. Rich malt and spiced aroma. Thick body for a lager. Quite surprised. Thick, malty, chocolate flavor with a cool, rich finish. Overall a tasty beer.
Silver City Wonderland (Winter Bock);Bremerton, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Silver City Brewery;I believe they changed the name to Wonderland Winter Lager for the 2015 season. Medium brown with minimal head. Sweet malts, lightly chocolaty, a hint of roasted malt, dark fruits, a bit of sugary booze, molasses is present in the finish. Rather sweet overall. Not bad, really. One is enough, however.
Silver City Wonderland (Winter Bock);Bremerton, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Silver City Brewery;Number 3 in the same blind tasting described by the raters below me. Pours relatively light compared to the others, with plentiful red highlights. Lightly fruity aroma. The beer is gently sweet, with caramel notes. Nothing special.
Silver City Wonderland (Winter Bock);Bremerton, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Silver City Brewery;"Bomber; beer #3 in a doppelbock blind tasting (even though this is a Dunkler bock on here but what’s the difference). This began the train of amber-copper colored beers. This was basically a bigger amber in my mind, can’t even tell its a lager. I even get a little bit of fruit esters. But the biggest give away about this beer is there is a definite American hoppiness (nondescript) that none of the other beers in the tasting had. Worst example of bock, period."

Silver City Wonderland (Winter Bock);Bremerton, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Silver City Brewery;Bottle. Pours a clear brown color with a moderate light tan head on there.

Silver City Wonderland (Winter Bock);Bremerton, Washington, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Silver City Brewery;On Tap at the Silverdale BP Clear deep chestnut brown, with a small coarse head. Toatested caramel malt aroma, I think the very cold serving temp muted this a bit. Great flavors of light roast, brown ale and some honey/wheat toast notes. Decent IBU bite at the end. A nice winter beer.

Wilmington Dergys Black and Tan;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Porter;Williamsville Brewery (formerly Wilmington Brewing);The aroma is caramel, heavily toasted malt, and hops. The appearance is nice. It has a huge head and the color is a dark brown and maroon. The flavor is not so great. It is very bitter and the malts are over cooked, burnt is more like it. On the plus side it does have some coffee taste. Palate is average. Aftertaste is bitter. Overall - not so great but a heack of a lot better than macro brew.
Hideout Dunkel Weizen;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;The Hideout Brewing Company;This wasn’t yet available on tap but I was able to score a sample. Surprisingly light-bodied for a dunkelweizen, even lighter than the Crusaders Weizen, with a cloudy brown-yellow body topped by a thin off-white head. Vinous aroma with notes of alcohol, sparkling grape juice, and banana. Alcohol hits heavy in the palate in addition to banana, white wine, and toast. Quite vinous and interesting. The sharp carbonation and alcohol kick give this a distinctive feel. One of the lightest dunkelweizens I’ve sampled but still worthy of a repeat tasting.
Hideout Oktoberfest;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Hideout Brewing Company;gold, no head, lo lace. nose of sweet malt. flavor is sweet malt. medium bodied, sweet finish. inoffensive. kinda one sided.

Hideout Oktoberfest;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Hideout Brewing Company;amber appearance with medium head...aroma is a tad indistinct, but has the aroma of an amber and some caramel notes as well...flavor is somewhat the same with a touch of hops
Hideout Oktoberfest;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Hideout Brewing Company;"On tap at The Hideout. Amber/light copper body, medium/thin off-white head. Corny, caramely, earthy, toasty aroma. Diacetyl shows up fairly strongly in the flavor (butterscotch), which was otherwise toasty and caramely with a hint of earthy hops. Medium-bodied; alcohol wasn’t really detected. The off-notes and overall weirdness ruined this offering for me."
Fruita Aspen Avenue Amber Lager;Fruita, Colorado, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Fruita Brewing Co.;"Medium amber hue. Soft body; moderate carbonation. Very sweet malts, with notes of caramel, milk chocolate, and buttered toast. A mild bitterness strived fecklessly to balance things out. Malt flavors were OK, but the overall sweetness was a bit too much."
Dry Dock USS Enterprise IPA;Aurora, Colorado, United States;IPA;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Golden pour with nice sized white head. Grassy hop nose with some citrus. Flavor is much the same with a bitter dry finish.
Dry Dock USS Enterprise IPA;Aurora, Colorado, United States;IPA;Dry Dock Brewing Company;On tap at First Draft Taproom & Kitchen. Clear, deep golden appearance with a white head. Mild aroma of bread, toasted grain, pine and resinous hops. Similar flavor, adding moderate hop bitterness and a mild malt sweetness. Medium body. A little bit boring overall.
Dry Dock USS Enterprise IPA;Aurora, Colorado, United States;IPA;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Odd aroma. Fishy, almost like salmon skin. Looks good, tastes very smooth with a hint of hops. Extremely drinkable, but I want more hops. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Dry Dock USS Enterprise IPA;Aurora, Colorado, United States;IPA;Dry Dock Brewing Company;December 18th, 2012 - I love the idea of beer named after a noble carriage of the Federation Fleet, but alas, if there was a label to go with the name’s wit, it didn’t show up in the picture I took of this brew. All I have is about a centimeter or so of lonely beer in a tall glass, a moderate gold, and no head, likely due to overexposure to the air, elements and over consumed. That is to say, I drank first, and asked questions (and took notes) later. The aroma has a distinct smell that makes me suspect this is closer to a double IPA than the single variety in lineage, stuffed with cotton candy, sugar coated almonds, booze, honey and pine, and the lot of it deep and intense. The flavor dials down the sweets that the aroma obsesses over, adding more noble hops, and graham cracker. Marshmallow puffs up in the aftertaste, too. It’s sweet, true, but not too sweet, and neither is it too piney, and wedged in there is a pronounced hops profile that tastes very American (though which breeds and cones I cannot say). The aftertaste loves to linger on the tongue as the alcohol slowly simmers on the taste buds. This is a wonderful beer, and on my calloused tongue it reminds me of Pliny (though unfairly, without all the hype and desperate, groping hands) which puts this beer high up on my IPA list.
Dry Dock USS Enterprise IPA;Aurora, Colorado, United States;IPA;Dry Dock Brewing Company;This beer is nice and floral, with an assertive bitterness. One of the best ipa’s I have had in Colorado. Has a nice aroma that reminds me of fresh cut grass, and a wonderful creaminess. I would highly recommend this beer.
Dry Dock USS Enterprise IPA;Aurora, Colorado, United States;IPA;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Bomber bottle poured a murky orange hue w/ large creamy white head and excellent lacing. Bold malty hay aroma. Initial flavor is light sweet w/ a moderate bitter finish. Tastes are bold hay, malt, pine, orange citrus, cereal, and grass. Full bodied, soft carbonation, and creamy mouthfeel.
Dry Dock USS Enterprise IPA;Aurora, Colorado, United States;IPA;Dry Dock Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Pour is clear orange with a big frothy tan head and great lacing. Huge ganja, garlic, onions, bready, light fruity, and caramelly aroma. Taste is huge garlicy and onion hops - light grapefruit, dank, weed, and bread with a medium bitter finish. Light body with medium carbobation. Not the best choice of hops.
Dry Dock USS Enterprise IPA;Aurora, Colorado, United States;IPA;Dry Dock Brewing Company;At Dry Dock with Stephen. Pours bronze cloudy light head. Aroma is earthy spicy hops, raw malt, light leather notes. Taste is not very good, dirt, old hay, raw old rye, earth bitterness.
Dry Dock USS Stout;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Dry Dock Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pushed on nitro. Pours very dark brown to black with a medium dark beige head. The nitrogen gave it a super thick and creamy head with great retention. Big roasted malt aroma. thinner body than I had expected. Perhaps it’s a bit too gypsum like.
Dry Dock USS Stout;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Dry Dock Brewing Company;damn. this is a great beer. i had this , amnd i mean a lot of it while shopping. i fucking destroyed my growler crossing the road, left my hops in the xenter of saqid road, by oh fuck hang on molly, this is good shit. pitch black with orange around the gray head, buty lets talk about thw aeoma. smekllls like perfection. seriously it has a licorice’coffee note with a strong bitter cocoa scent, it is alcohgolioc to all hell. the kind of scent to make a teetotaker take a dcdrinkj,. strong toffee and chyocolate flavor, an amazing beer. i know my pint isa at least 18 monthys old, but the flavors arte crisp and pyre. cocoa puffs flavor dominates with an alcohohol edge,. i had 3 pints, and i wajnt more. fuck my hand eye coordinatiotion is screwed.
Dry Dock USS Stout;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Dry Dock Brewing Company;On tap at the Dry Dock Brewery Tasting Room. I’m assuming this is the one I had as it was listed as the USS Stout (Imperial Stout). Poured a dark black with red edges and an averaged sized tan head. Aromas of chocolate, dark fruits, caramel, and some roast. Tastes of chocolate, dark fruits, toffee, roast and light coffee.
Dry Dock USS Stout;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Dry Dock Brewing Company;"Beer is nearly opaque, dark warm brown with a small, light brown, frothy, mostly diminishing head. The aroma is malty with very warm-hued notes of heavy roasted grain, moderate chocolate and coffee, light molasses; Hoppy with a moderate note of resin/pine; Yeasty wtih a light note of basement; Moderate miscellaneous notes of vanilla and oak, light note of alcohol and a trace of blueberry. The flavor is moderately sweet, moderately-to-heavily bitter with a long, moderately bitter/dry, lightly sweet finish. Heavy roasty retros and aftertaste. The body is full the texture is velvety and the carbonation is lively."
Dry Dock USS Stout;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Growler: Black with dark walnut edges. Tiny-bubbled, sticky beige foam. Potent inky and smoky aromas delight the senses, as do whispers of burnt cookies, dark chocolate truffles, and tar. Densely carbonated, but fairly pointy. Silky and oily in body. Initially charred and harshly roasty, yet with a delightful lactose and smoky lactose kiss which offsets the enormous malt girth. Alcohol is apparent, but quite clean, and oodles of ink notes soften the remaining stiff tannins. Immense complexity arises from the earthy java and black licorice depths, as does as a richly tarry astringency. Finishes extremely supple and tarry with notes of blueberry and ink, but equally laden with forceful, malt-derived roast, char, and coffee which impart endless depth. Lord knows there aren’t nearly enough well-made Foreign Stouts in the world, but this is certainly one of them. Dry Dock has a real gem on their hands with this.
Dry Dock USS Stout;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Dry Dock Brewing Company;From growler. Head is initially small, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing. Body is dark brown to black. Aroma is moderately to heavily malty (roasted grain, chocolate, molasses, caramel, coffee), with notes of blueberry/blackberry, vanilla. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety/syrupy texture, lively carbonation. Wow. VERY impressive. I’ll be honest when I say that this was a surprise. This had no faults that I could find, was extremely sexy in the nose, and had a very rich mouth experience. Sweet, as a foreign stout should be, but very well-balanced in the finish. Damned solid. I can’t wait to see what they can do with an Imperial or Dry stout.
Dry Dock USS Stout;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Dry Dock Brewing Company;I would have immediately charazterized this as a sweet stout, just judging from the aroma. Has that sweet and sour sweetener aroma, that I always recognize from lactic sweetener. Medium bodied, with some rich and sweet chocolate covered caramel candy flavor. Mildy roasty, with a ton of bittersweet flavors, butterscotch and toffee candies. Well made, but loses body due to all the residual sugary sweetness.
Dry Dock USS Stout;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Deep and dark brown. Big caramel in the nose, oddly enough. Light roast, pinch of sourness, sweet milk ... and big, syrupy-sweet caramel flavors. Only a mild bitterness follows. Tasty and well made, but way too sweet for me.
Gordon Biersch Helles;San Jose, California, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Draft at Miami location. Poured a clear amber color with a moderate fizzy white head that diminished slowly with good lacing. Balanced bread malt aroma. Medium body with soft carbonation.

Walnut Brewery Belgian Wit;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Walnut Brewery (Rock Bottom);Tap @ Walnut. Cloudy yellow with white head. Zesty, spicy aroma with some wheat. Flavor is typical for the style minus the usually citrus flavors. Crisp and refreshing. Fairly good.

Walnut Brewery Belgian Wit;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Walnut Brewery (Rock Bottom);"Looked a lot like orange juice, curiously enough; very little, if any, head to speak of. Overall, very mild throughout. Light body, pale malts, subdued spice, and weak bitterness. No off-flavors, just not exciting at all. ""American Wheat"" is to ""German Wheat,"" as this was to a true ""Belgian Wit."""
Montgomery Roggenbier;Montgomery, Alabama, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Montgomery Brewing Company (AL);Barrel Draught from the jug at the GABF, Colorado Convention Center 01/10/2005 Golden coloured with pale and sour fruit aromas.

Montgomery Roggenbier;Montgomery, Alabama, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Montgomery Brewing Company (AL);Fruity, herbal, sweet, grainy aroma. Golden coloured body is lightly hazy with a cover of white head that recedes to ring with some lace. Fieldberries and banana with a light graininess and moderate bitterness. Medium light body with decent carbonation. Sampled at GABF 2005.
Montgomery Roggenbier;Montgomery, Alabama, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Montgomery Brewing Company (AL);Surprisingly strong hops, herbal, leafy and rooty kick the toasted cereals maltiness down, taking most of the place in the nose. Certainly will hidden rye influence, the palate doesn’t deploy much flavour at all, remaining mostly sweet and bready, slightly caramel touched and thin.
Montgomery Roggenbier;Montgomery, Alabama, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Montgomery Brewing Company (AL);"Hazy dark gold. Nice and smooth mouthfeel; fairly easy to drink ... aside from a cloying sweetness that lingers a little too long. Banana nose carries into the flavor a little. Flavors/aromas of yeast and bread dough laid on a little too thick. Earthy malts. Bitterness was kind of stark and caught me off-guard."
Montgomery Roggenbier;Montgomery, Alabama, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Montgomery Brewing Company (AL);10.01.05 GABF After the beer I had before this one, a glass of dishwater would’ve been a treat. This stuff is hazy, dark, brassy gold. Yeasty aroma like a bakery before dawn. Fresh and almost like a very flowery hefe. Birdseed (?). Astringent, grassy, spicy, and pretty durn good.
Montgomery Roggenbier;Montgomery, Alabama, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Montgomery Brewing Company (AL);GABF 2005. Dark golden body with a small, fully-fading sudsy white head. Unexpected clove-like aroma and very mild rye notes. Reminds me of a weizenbock. Considerable plastic phenols and fruitiness in the flavor. Prominent spiciness seems to come from both hops and rye. Semi-dry with medium bitterness and a medium-light body. The good part is the mere fact that someone is brewing beer in Alabama. I applaud that anyway.
Montgomery Roggenbier;Montgomery, Alabama, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Montgomery Brewing Company (AL);Pour is light golden with a thin off white head...smell is perfumey, citrus, grain, dough...flavor is very banana and grainy...interesting enough...
Third Street Aleworks Super Brown;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Brown Ale;Third Street Aleworks;Draft. Brown beer with no head. Malty and cascade type aroma. Roasty, nutty, malty flavor with some chocolate and balanced hops. Nice malt complexity.

Third Street Aleworks Bad Santa;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Third Street Aleworks;Tap at the brewpub. A deep red mahogany red body with an off white head.

Jacks Pumpkin Spice Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);2007 Rating, logged Mar 2018. Just found it. I'm guessing this beer was a little bit better in the past. Pours orange/god, with a little white quick dissipating head. Nose is toasty of cereal, nutmeg, pie spice, and vegetable sweetness. Squash flavours hide behind a decent but perhaps overly spritzy beer (no doubt because of AB's apt hand for that type of mouth-feel). Herbal notes in the dry finish. Not too bad. (6s are 6.5s).
Jacks Pumpkin Spice Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);The best thing about this was the aroma and appearance. Aroma of pumpkin with the cinnamon, clove and ginger showing up, all were nicely balanced. A deep amber body, plenty of carbonation that left good lacing. Average mouthfeel, flavor was a little disappointing with a little pumpkin showing up but as it warmed it got bland. Originally rated on 11/14/08.
Jacks Pumpkin Spice Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Pours a light golden amber with almost no head. Light pumpkin spice aromas. Flavor is sweet spicy with a little bitterness on the tail.
Jacks Pumpkin Spice Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"I can’t believe I’m rating a Michelob this high, but was one notch better than ""just average"" for me. Remember right after Halloween I wanted to buy another 6-pack, looking around few different grocery stores and Wal-Mart but were all out. During these economical times I have been trying to be more cost-effective with my beer purchases so this fits the category. For $6 and change per six I’m finding some of these new Mich flavors are well worth the price. Now to the actual beer. Dark orange with some amber color. Can see through the beer in a glass, so on the lighter side, but not TOO light. I thought it would be lighter until I poured it and saw it was 5.5%. Good flavor with cinnamin, pumpkin, and other spices...but not overwhelming. Medium carbonation with a light head. I will definitely buy this again if it comes out next season."
Jacks Pumpkin Spice Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Orange and medium bodied with a thick chemically pumpkin flavor and a watery mouthfeel.
Jacks Pumpkin Spice Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"""one left over from the holiday, and addded to a recent tasting for shits and giggles. really, not as bad as my initial reaction when i found out this beer existed. the aroma is quite pleasant, if not terribly complex. lots of cinnomon and spices. looks ok. the feel, though, is too light, and takes away a little from what may be a decent flavor."""
Jacks Pumpkin Spice Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);The head builds up tall and has a creamy off white color. It quickly fades down to a thin ring of lace around the edge of the glass. This head sits on top of a golden honey colored body with very good clarity. The aroma has a light grainy character with a lots of pumpkin pie spice mixed in. It has a bit hit of spice throughout with cinnamon being most noticeable over other pumpkin pie spices. Hop flavor seems neutral but it adds bitterness the cinnamon flavor. Underneath there is a mildly sweet malty flavor with some mild pumpkin flavor. The finishes quickly and has a grainy alcohol quality to it. The body is light to medium with a thin, watery and slick feel. Its carbonation is about average. Overall this is defiantly not a standout and its fairly heavy spicing can become a little bit overpowering.
Jacks Pumpkin Spice Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);This was a poor excuse for a pumpkin beer. Very light bodied with almost no spice flavor and no malt backbone.
Jacks Pumpkin Spice Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);This spiced pumpkin ale from Anheuser-Busch is probably one of their most interesting beers. Pours a golden amber with a slight scent of pumpkin. Drinks very smooth with a slight pumpkin taste however the spices stand out more. Not a bad beer by any means but there certainly is room for in improvement by increasing the strength of the pumpkin and spice taste. Still a good choice to get you into the fall mood.
Jacks Pumpkin Spice Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Orange pour. Smells like pumpkin. Tastes like pumpkin. I like pumpkin pie. Just not for a drink ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Great Northern Rye Beer;Fargo, North Dakota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Great Northern Brewery and Restaurant;GABF 2005: Not too many notes about this one...hazed golden hue and very good lacing...fruity and a bit hoppy on the nose with some rye character...taste was very average at best, hoppy and bready, no depth...okay, drinkable.

Great Northern Rye Beer;Fargo, North Dakota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Great Northern Brewery and Restaurant;09.29.05 GABF Coudy golden, big sticky head. Odd aromas of bananas, hefe, and grass. There must be a bunch of wheat in this rye brew. Yeasty and doughy. I’d like it to be much drier and have a stronger rye presence.
Great Northern Rye Beer;Fargo, North Dakota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Great Northern Brewery and Restaurant;GABF 2005. Cloudy, toasted straw color with a fading, slightly oily, sudsy off-white head. Good spicy rye and hop notes and an odd phenolic clove and electrical fire quality in the aroma and flavor. Medium tart acidity and medium bitterness. So-so as far as rye beers go.
Bushys John Quilliams Bitter;Douglas, Isle of Man;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bushys (Mount Murray Brewing);Cask Conditioned at The George, Barford St Micheal, Oxon. Hazed orange beer with a whisp of a head. Floral fruity bitter, not fully settled, although given plenty of time. Quite an apple aroma and flavour comes through. Some juicy hops on the finish. Could be good, but in this case, struggling.
Issaquah Farm Frog;Issaquah, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Issaquah Brew House (Rogue Ales);I love how you can get the most odd beers in Japan on tap. A quick disappaiting head sits on top of a light amber brew. Oranges, spices, wet blanket and funky earthy note resonate from the beer. The mouth had mouth orange spice than I expected, kind like a cross between a saison and a triple. Lingering spicy orangey finish.
Issaquah Farm Frog;Issaquah, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Issaquah Brew House (Rogue Ales);This is the same as the Eugene City beer. This was a really nice Saison. Pours a beautiful cloudy glowing orange, with a tall white head. Lots of spice in the aroma, orange peel, slight fruit tartness smell to it. Taste was very well balanced, citrus flavors up front, followed by a nice blend of spices, finishing with a medium dry finish.
Issaquah Farm Frog;Issaquah, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Issaquah Brew House (Rogue Ales);Cloudy golden hue that offers a mostly diminishing if dense white cover. Rather grainy malt base. The hops act as the spice they are, tighting it all together, offering hay-like, grassy, floral flavors. Sharp carbonation enhances the floral aspects and dries it out well. Quite dry actually toward the end despite the sweet candied grainy beginnings. Not much of yeast influence here for a saison, but nice noble hops at work. Light-medium bodied, very drinkable, but unexceptional.
Issaquah Farm Frog;Issaquah, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Issaquah Brew House (Rogue Ales);On Tap @ Rogue(Issaquah)- Pours a hazy golden yellow, nice thin white head.

Westons Bounds Brand Cider;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;Keg. Light yellow, hazy. Tart, red, apples, or actually the skin and seeds only.

Westons Bounds Brand Cider;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;Plastic Jug (Hilpea Haukki, Helsinki) Hazy yelly. Exceedingly tart palate. Slight phenolid aroma. Fruitiness gone, only some skins left. Has a kick like a concrete mule - it pulls my face into contortions, it’s so tart! Thank goodness for that, otherwise this would be a waste of apples - scrumpy should never be this weak ABV.
Westons Bounds Brand Cider;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;August 12, 2011 - cask at The Draft House (Tower Bridge). Hazy, extremely pale yellow with virtually no head. Very appealing aroma - I get more pear than apple, but what do I know? - tart, a bit funky and vinous (grapeskins?), light alcohol. Taste is very simple, more about ripe green apples and not much sweetness, decently acidic and dry - light, with a hint of Reisling. Average body, strong acidic, some life on the tongue, finishes dry and acidic, for some reason I got some bacon in the aftertaste (no, I had not been eating a bacon butty).
Westons Bounds Brand Cider;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;Cask at Draft House. Cloudy yellow - no head. Light fresh apples. Wooden notes. Light sweet start. Dry bitrer finish.

Nice flavor, not too sweet, bit of funk and dankity dank - though mellow - and faint tartness. Light bodied with soft carbonation. Finishes dry or semi-dry, mildy sweet with some lingering, crisp apples. I like this kind of cider.
Westons Bounds Brand Cider;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;On hand pump at the Goddard Arms, Clyffe Pypard, Wiltshire 29/1/2011. Pale yellow with a bit of fizz and slight haze. Sweet, pulped apples with the faintest trace of the barnyard. Has an unpleasant, industrial edge to it.
Westons Bounds Brand Cider;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;Bag in a box at County Hotel JDW Ashford. Pale green gold with haze. Some apple flavour but a tad vague. Touch of wood spirit. Poor vinegar aroma. Yug I think is the word. Cant finish a half pint.
Westons Bounds Brand Cider;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;Cask - The Glass House (JDW), Norwich. A clear, pale yellow with no head & a slight effervescence. Predominantly sweet apple aroma, just a slight tang there though it’s quite subdued on the whole. A bit farty with weak apple flavours, a bit of white wine finishing with a light & short green apple tang. Soft & moderately dry medium body with low carbonation.

Shiner Dunkelweizen (Winter Ale);Shiner, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);12oz bottle. Medium brown pour with an off white head. Sweet malt notes. Better than the average Shiner but still meh.
Shiner Dunkelweizen (Winter Ale);Shiner, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);Hazy, red pour with a white head. The aroma is sugary malt. It has a light body with slick texture and average carbonation. The taste is sweet all the way through.
Shiner Dunkelweizen (Winter Ale);Shiner, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);Taste: deep earthy, spice bread, semi sweet dark wheat with an easy finish. Malty wheat bread, flour nose. Nice mahogany red hue, mostly clear, tall foamy head and lace on glass. Full body. smooth and close to style.
Shiner Dunkelweizen (Winter Ale);Shiner, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);Beautiful aroma and flavor. Taste is roasted malt and hint of spice. I really like this beer!
Shiner Dunkelweizen (Winter Ale);Shiner, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);"24 ounce bottle into weizen glass, best before 4/26/2018. Pours slightly hazy reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with amazing retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts the whole glass. Thick soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Insane appearance. Aromas of big banana, bubblegum, clove, pepper, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread crust, and toasted biscuit; with light notes of nuttiness, roast, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big banana, bubblegum, clove, pepper, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread crust, and toasted biscuit; with light notes of nuttiness, roast, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Mild herbal/grassy bitterness and yeast spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of banana, bubblegum, clove, pepper, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread crust, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitter/spiciness balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from bitter/spiciness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 5.6%. Overall this is an excellent dunkelweizen style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop flavors; extremely smooth and pretty refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Likely to be a new recipe over the retired version. This is listed as Brewer's Pride #13, slightly higher ABV. Nicely rich Munich/Vienna malts, balancing weizen yeast, and mild noble hop complexity. A really enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."
Shiner Dunkelweizen (Winter Ale);Shiner, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);Draft at The Irish Pol. Hazy dark copper pour with white foam. Apparently unretired. New version loaded with glossy dark red fruity malts. Nail polish. Currants. Mulled wine. Prunes. Cinnamon sticks. Molasses. Boxing gloves. Medium-bodied. A middling punch to the face.
Shiner Dunkelweizen (Winter Ale);Shiner, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);A deep amber colored body with decent carbonation and a mid sized white cap. Aroma of roasted malts and a little earthy. Taste of caramel and roasted malts but there was a metallic presence that spoils it. Overall its is an o.k. brew but not one i would try again. Shiners winter version of this beer is alot better than the regular dunkel it is brewed with pecans and peaches and that gives it a really nice taste. Even though there was still a metallic twinge to it I found it to be much more enjoyable. i would rate the winter version at 3.7. try the winter version if you can find it. I hope that the winter version is given its own review space since its revised seasonal flavors make it a different beer. Originally rated on 11/16/08
Shiner Dunkelweizen (Winter Ale);Shiner, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);Not really a fan of this beer. Its sweetness isn’t so much rich or caramelly, as it is some sort of spicy fruit. Not that the flavor is all that compelling. Thankfully, this isn’t an incredibly powerful beer.
Shiner Dunkelweizen (Winter Ale);Shiner, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);Really a decent try at a dunkelweizen, has a good wheat flavor to it, one of the better Shiner beers.
Shiner Dunkelweizen (Winter Ale);Shiner, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Spoetzl Brewery (Gambrinus Company);(Sample Date: 11/10/2010 Source:Other) Peaches and roasted nuts. Holiday Cheer. Peach fruitiness almost strawberry in aroma. Clear amber brown with little head. Peach, kiwi fruit, watermelon like flavor with some nuttiness. Light body and a fizzy mouth feel. Finish is fruity and moderately bitter. Interesting.
Baggaardsbryggeriet Blondie Ekstra Guld;Holstebro, Denmark;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Baggaardsbryggeriet;70 cl bottle. Copper colored and clear with compact white head with good retention. The aroma is pasta and grass and with a hint of roses. As it enters the mouth the most noticeable thing is the perfect malt flavor that has many layers without any sticking out, as it should be for a session beer. Bread and caramel dominates with notes of wood and a hint of cardboard. Light but refreshing bitterness and lively carbonation. Quite dark in the color for a beer named Blondie, but nonetheless a nice balanced beer, that I could probably quaff all night.
Baggaardsbryggeriet Blondie Ekstra Guld;Holstebro, Denmark;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Baggaardsbryggeriet;Draught, Hazy orange colour with a off-white head. Weak yeasty, spicy, citrus aroma and a sweet dry fruity taste. Medium body and a sweet light dry finish.
De Molen Borefts Bock (2005);Bodegraven, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);Bottled. Brown to black hue. Hazy. Fair lace. Delivers faint hints of apple and smoke aromas against hoppy background. Smoke is also felt in the flavor. The more you warm it in the palm, the more it reminds a rauchbier. It’s also de Molen-wise hoppy, varnish notes come through as it warms up – also de Molen-wise. Some sweet fruits are present. Agree with jbrus – not a bok. Overall, not exciting but absolutely reputable.
De Molen Borefts Bock (2005);Bodegraven, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);Bottled. Aroma of faint fruits and light herbal. Red color, beige head, good lace. Light sweet, bitter, herbal, fruity, when warming up a little caramel comes in and very very far away it has a marzen rauchbier feeling, bit thin finish. I think it’s a nice Belgian ale but has nothing to do with bock.
De Molen Borefts Bock (2005);Bodegraven, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);Blindfold test in Café Morshuis in Albergen. Cloudy. yeasty aroma and flavor. Grapes, pineapple and hops. Initial sweetness overwhelmed by yeast. Not really good.
De Molen Borefts Bock (2005);Bodegraven, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);hazy brown beer. aromas of roasted malt, spices and flowery. taste: sweetish, hoppy(grassy), roasted malt, bit dark chocolate, bit coffee. finishes bitter and fruity. bit fizzy co2 and medium bodied. quite good bokbeer. or maybe an english strong ale...
De Molen Borefts Bock (2005);Bodegraven, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);Cloudy dark color, medium creamy head. Aroma of roasted malts, laurel, coffee. Sweet and roasted malty taste, soft creamy texture. Quite bitter in the end. It’s almost a dutch version of Guinness...but i like Guinness.
Brugge Brasserie Old Dog The Grand Cru;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brugge Brasserie;The weakest offering from Brugge is still better than the best offering from most other places. This one is sort of like a weaker version of the Triple, but with a more hoppy character and some IPA characteristics. Slightly bitter, but solid. Perfectly acceptable but hard to suggest that someone try when theres more delicious offerings on tap...maybe after you try the Triple and the Black though!
Brugge Brasserie Old Dog The Grand Cru;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brugge Brasserie;OK this was a major letdown for me, on tap in Indy. Would have never guessed this to be a Grand Cru or belgian strong, it was more like a cheap american red. No spice and no sour, just watered down and a touch of belgian sweetness. Maybe brewed for the mindless masses (and lord knows, IN is full of them), but this needs an overhaul.
Brugge Brasserie Old Dog The Grand Cru;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brugge Brasserie;Tap at brewery: Slightly hazy golden hue with a fading head and spotty lace. The aroma has notes of grains of paradise, clove, cardamom, ginger bread cookies, wheat and some noted alcoholic vapours. The taste is weird, there was a slight note of vinegar twang around the edges before the base malt and sweet fruits come to play. The finish again is spice driven and what appears the be ginger becomes a tad overpowering, a bit boozy on the palate as well. This beer is all of the place, part of it I liked and part of it is discombobulated.
Brugge Brasserie Old Dog The Grand Cru;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brugge Brasserie;GABF 2007. I don’t know if I was drinking the same stuff as you, but I found this impressively horrible. It was impressive in the strength of the flavor and the sheer amount of spice (and variety of spice) in it. Unfortunately, the spice was overwhelming. I really wanted to buckle down and pick out all the things I was tasting, but I couldn’t get around the fact that it was gross, and that I didn’t want any more. Cardamom, white pepper, clove, and ginger on the nose was enticing, but was already hinting at excessiveness. The utter lack of any balance in the mouth was beyond disappointing.
Brugge Brasserie Old Dog The Grand Cru;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brugge Brasserie;(Draught) Pours a clear golden body with a moderate off-white head. Aroma of grains of paradise, orange peel, clove, and pepper. Flavor of toasted/rich malt, caramel, and fruit.
Brugge Brasserie Old Dog The Grand Cru;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brugge Brasserie;GABF 2007: Poured a clear golden color with an off-white head. Spicey and clovey aroma and flavor. Some light malt in the flavor. Light bodied.

Brugge Brasserie Old Dog The Grand Cru;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brugge Brasserie;Holy cow, what a beer. Pours brown, cloudy, with a minor head. Aroma is very spicy with hints of cinnamon and ginger. Flavor is a complex mix of spices. Very delicious. Light-moderate mouth feel. Very good offering.
Brugge Brasserie Old Dog The Grand Cru;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brugge Brasserie;Sample at Indiana Microbrewers Festival - Aroma is spicy ginger, coriander and pepper. Pours hazy amber with no head. Flavor is also very spicy and a little acidic. Palate is thin and smooth. Pretty tasty if you like spicy brews.
Brugge Brasserie Gentlemans Preferred Blonde;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brugge Brasserie;"Tap at brewery, listed just as ""Blond"". A coppery hue (not blonde at all) with a fading frothy head and some lace. The aroma has notes of Belgium sugar, caramel, cookie dough, orange zest and banana esters, and some coriander. The taste is sweet and fruity with a pale malt background. The finish is a bit herbal hop and spice. The mouth feel is soft and sticky, a bit medicinal on the finish. A solid offering but hardly what I expected, sort of a witbier crossed with a big Belgian."
Brugge Brasserie Gentlemans Preferred Blonde;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brugge Brasserie;"Listed in the pub as ""Blond,"" this one pours a medium orange with a thick, off white head. Really a lovely beer that I decided to try after seeing its appearance at another table. Nose is spice and citrus, in addition to the yeast and alcohol, and flavors are much the same. Really a very good beer, and one I’m glad to have on tap, locally."

Brugge Brasserie Gentlemans Preferred Blonde;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brugge Brasserie;Labeled as the Blonde. Sugary dough flavors, slightly funky belgian yeastiness, some undefined citrus and no real alcohol detected. Hoppiness shines through in the aroma (grass). Good body, a bit heavy. Quite drinkable.
Brugge Brasserie Gentlemans Preferred Blonde;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brugge Brasserie;Tap at brewpub served in chalice - Aroma of doughy yeast, orange peel, clove and coriander. Pours cloudy orange with a small head and great lacing. Flavor is also doughy yeast but with more saison-like funkiness. Then the orange peel and spice cling to the tounge. Palate is creamy then sticky. The best blonde I have ever had that’s for sure, like a tame saision. Easy drinking and tasty while sitting outside on a beautiful spring day.
Brugge Brasserie Gentlemans Preferred Blonde;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brugge Brasserie;Indescribably good brewpub ale, only because Belgian beers are usually refermented in bottle, and aged. The carbonation level is therefore slightly less, but the quality is nothing less than astonishing and unique, to compensate. Nose is phenolic, of bananas and clove, nearly weissbier aroma ! Taste of a subtle tripel ( apple,peach,light malt,alcohol ) crossed with everything good about hefeweizen,ie., banana/clove in aroma and flavor, drinkability. One of the best beers I have ever had, served in a brewpub 30 minutes from my house. Zen, or good fortune-who cares ? Race to this unique Belgian Brewpub today.

Falcon Beer 2.1%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Sverige;Pale golden with a tiny white head. Light vegetable and dishwater aroma. God, this is bloody awful. Very buttery, sweet, vegetable flavour with no bitterness. Long and nasty finish. I don’t think I could imagine a worse beer.
Falcon Beer 2.1%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Sverige;Whereas many of the Swedish low-alcohol lunch beers are actually pretty inoffensive, this is outright nasty. Skunky hops, DMS, more metal than headbanger’s ball. This beer’s got it all.
Falcon Beer 2.1%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Sverige;[Canned] Golden, brief airy head. Aroma of boiled vegtables. Sweetish, watery and grainy with a metallic edge. An unpleasant alternative to mineral water.
Falcon Beer 2.1%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Sverige;Can. Pale golden colour with a white head. Malty aroma and a malty, light skunky taste. Light body.
Falcon Beer 2.1%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Sverige;Can. Clear yellow coloured with a white head. Skunky aroma of fruits and malts. Skunky flavour of malts, corn and fruits.
Falcon Beer 2.1%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Sverige;A standare lifhty with a little maltier charchter than the average light lager. Don’t expect too much, but if youu have to stay very sober - it is an alternative.
De Molen Borefts Grand Cru;Bodegraven, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);From notes: Bottle, over 1 year old. Copper/brown color. Almost no head. Aroma’s: soft, sweet, herbal, fruit, a bit old. Flavor is medium sweet, a little bit old, a hint of fruity acidity. Full bodied. Slightly dry finish. Good, but expected a bit more.
De Molen Borefts Grand Cru;Bodegraven, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);On tap at the brewery. Aroma is very fruity and light herbal. Orange/brown color, beige head, very nice lace. Very sweet start, very fruity, herbal and spicy in the finish, very warming. This is a dangereous beer, very alcoholic but also very easy drinking.
Blue Ridge (SC) Squirmin German OFest;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Blue Ridge Brewing Co. (SC);on tap-pours an off white head and cloudy orange/brown color.

Blue Ridge (SC) Squirmin German OFest;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Blue Ridge Brewing Co. (SC);GABF 2005: Pours yellowish with no head or lacing. There was a malt aroma that wasn’t too bad. Taste was nothing special. It was just worth the sample.
The Tap Oktoberfest;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;on tap-pours amber with an offwhite head. Aroma is sweet light/medium malt-caramel. Taste is sweet light/medium malt-caramel, 2nd spice/citrus hops.
The Tap Oktoberfest;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Pours a clear dark red/maroon leaving a thick frothy white head. The aroma is caramel, nuts, some earthy herbal notes followed by a hint of smoked molasses. The taste is full frontal malt, balanced with a sharp hop bite that asks to be noticed. But that fruity, nutty, date sweetness dominates the palate. The finish is sweet but again leaves you with a small bitter bite, nice oktoberfest.
The Tap Oktoberfest;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Dark roasted malts, light tannins, dark fig, tea, light burnt caramel, light grape, very watered down coffee, medium sweetness, almost cloying. One of the best October fests that I have ever had.
The Tap Oktoberfest;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;GABF 2005: Wow, my second time being first rater. Poured a light color don’t remember what color but, it has very little head. Aroma was strong of hops. Taste was hoppy but, not too much. It finished dry which was nice.
De Molen Fruitbier;Bodegraven, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);Tap at the brewery. Fruity, light herbal aroma. Hazy, amber color, off-white head, good lace. Sweet and sour, fruity (forest fruits), bitter and herbal in the finish. Bit thin in the middle.
Stumpys Bosuns Call;Upper Swanmore, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Stumpys Brewery;Bottled. Reddish amber, rich head. Resiny hop aroma. Very dry and densely malty. Roasty, almost burnt malt flavour medium bodied. Lingering resiny finish. The promised rum and fruits are very vague, but the beer works anyway.
Stumpys Bosuns Call;Upper Swanmore, Hampshire, England;Old Ale;Stumpys Brewery;BCA ( from Bottles of Botley, BBE Jan 06). Fairly maltywith raisins. Spice and rum faintly detectable but dont play a major part in the flavour profile. At this strength I want a bit more flavour, I’m sure the navy of 200 years ago would not be impressed with this wishy washy ale.
Bell's Batch 7000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;The aroma is licorice, dates. Pours black with no head and no lacing. The taste is a little sweet then a little bitter. The body is medium/full, the texture is creamy, the carbonation is average and the finish is bitter. This beer has held up very well and is still an excellent brew.
Bell's Batch 7000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;ClarkVV sharing the 12 year old imperial stout. Thanks for the tick but the oxidation has gotten out of control. Cardboard, wet newspaper, chocolate malt. I bet this was really good when fresh. Thanks for the share anyhow.
Bell's Batch 7000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;Poured from bottle hand waxed thanks Clark 12 year old bottle dark black with tan head. Aromas is dark fruit raisin cocoa and chocolate. Taste is cardboard wood dark fruit cocoa.
Bell's Batch 7000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;Totally black, pours without any head. Thanks Clark for this hand-waxed bottle. it smells good. raisin, cocoa and a little cardboard. cardboard, very old. loads of old flavors. raisins, peppermint, wood, dark fruit. lingering finish is soy sauce.
Bell's Batch 7000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;Compared to 6000, oxidation has also clearly set in, but not in a good way. Deep roast malt and chocolate with soy notes. Not undrinkable, just not that good.
Bell's Batch 7000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;Bottle acquired from a trade awhile back. ClarkVV I think. Thanks! 400th imperial stout rate, so that’s pretty cool. The beer is a thick, oily black with a beige head of foam that diminishes to just a ring around the glass. The beer has huge raisin and leather characteristics to it. Moderate sweetness resonates on the tongue for awhile after the sip. The beer tastes great right now. Age hasn’t done it any harm! Big body. Fairly low carbonation. Great beer!
Bell's Batch 7000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;Brewed in Sept 2005, drinken in July 2016. APPEARANCE- super dark. Nicely dark carmel color head. NOSE- deep, dark scents. Licorice, heavy boosy. FLAVOR- very boosy, deep flavors you’d expect for such a tremendously dark beer. Some black licorice NOTES- not sure if this would have been better 4-5 years ago, or if it could stay in the cellar a couple more years.
Bell's Batch 7000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;12 oz bottle shared with Jason and Brian. The pour is a dark black with a lovely collar of dark khaki head and no lace. The aroma is real good. There is a strong dark fruit and a nice roast. Nice booziness present with the malts and fruits. The flavor is similar. There is a big tobacco leaf or leather note from the oxidization. There is a good fruitiness that backs up to a light hop on the far back end. The mouth feel is lighter and well carbonated with a lingeringly malty, leathery aftertaste. Not too bad. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bell's Batch 7000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;Bottle shared by Ryan..big thanks! Pours dark brown. Strong bourbon aroma and a little nutty. Taste same with nice dry roasty finish. Aged really well. Really good....so glad I got to try this.

Newport Beach Ten;Newport Beach, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Beach Brewing Company;Cloudy copper, small off-white head lasts. Big malt nose reminds of cookies at first, but swiftly, maple kicks in as well as caramel cereals. The hops give it a bolder turn, contributing important earthiness, and floral leafiness. Medium-full bodied, woody, slightly smoky. Creamy texture, engaging soft carbonation, no acidity, but a rather intense alcohol presence considering the limited ABV.
Newport Beach Ten Wood;Newport Beach, California, United States;Tripel;Newport Beach Brewing Company;Cloudy copper hued, producing a very nice off-white head that humiliates the non-wood aged version’s. It shows most of the basic beer barleywine aromas with a stronger focus on vanilla, less earth and hops, but just as much maple. In mouth, it feels smokier, grapey with strong alcohol that fits the case and a surprisingly full body for a beer aged in wood.
Newport Beach Ten Wood;Newport Beach, California, United States;Tripel;Newport Beach Brewing Company;Sharp bourbon and vanilla scent that wafts up into my face and tries to burn my eyes out. Damn this is some strong stuff... vaporous and caustic. Hot everywhere, tasting like wood, brown sugar and maple, with an overbearing scent of fuel that sits in the nose for too long. Finishes with a decently strong bite, but this is not my cup of tea.
Great Northern Hefeweizen;Fargo, North Dakota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Great Northern Brewery and Restaurant;GABF 05. Pours a beautiful cloudy orange with a strong aroma of bubblegum, clove, and banana. Flavor is more of the same. Great hefe.
Great Northern Hefeweizen;Fargo, North Dakota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Great Northern Brewery and Restaurant;GABF 2005: The aroma was stronger than any other Hefeweizen I have had. The taste was a bit sweeter than most Hefeweizens that I have had.
Bluegrass Welts Bat Quad;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Pours rusty mahogany with very thin off-white head. The aroma is caramel, plum, malt, and burnt sugar. The flavor has a crapton of burnt sugar, almost overwhelmingly so. There is also some green wood, honey, and melon. The aftertaste is quite sticky. This could be good, but the cloying sweetness ruins it for me.
Bluegrass Welts Bat Quad;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Bluegrass Brewing Company;draught. I was pretty stoked for this one after sampling their tasty stout. Unfortunately, I was really let down. This brew is hugely sweet. Sweet to the point where it’s laborious to finish a half-pint. There are a bit of spices evident, but due to the ovebearing sugar it really comes across as some type of hard candy. The nose didn’t warn me of the danger ahead and was overall pleasing enough. It was more vinous with some plums and nutmeg, though a bit of the sugar was there.
Bluegrass Welts Bat Quad;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Pours reddish amber with a fully receding tan head. Aroma of malty sugar, cloves, caramel, candied figs, and brown sugar. Taste is quite sweet and fruity which hides the alcohol well, but this is not nearly well balanced enough to be considered a good Belgian Quad. Mouthfeel is heavy with a sticky body and lush carbonation. Not bad, but the expected standard of quality is set high when you attempt a Belgian style.
Bluegrass Welts Bat Quad;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draft - minimal aroma, possibly due to temperature. A ruby body with a small ring of beige bubbles around the glass rim. Very sweet flavor! Bordering on - if not crossing into - unbalanced despite 55 IBUs. I do not get the complexity that is typical of the style and advertised in their literature. No spices, no hops. A miss.
Bluegrass Welts Bat Quad;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Bluegrass Brewing Company;GABF 2005: poured a clear brown/orange with a medium tan head. Aroma is fruity with a bit of caramel. Flavor is very sweet with fruit and malt. Powerful alcohol presence. Pretty tasty but a huge beer.
Bluegrass Welts Bat Quad;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Mostly headless clear and pale copper. Highly liquorous nose makes one think of coencentrated brown sugar at first, but a huge slap of honey and maple ultimately dominates. Very fruity on the palate, it evocates grape, fig and juicy prunes, in an extremely sweet fashion that makes you think of vanilla. Oaky, cola-ish and beanily vegetal, it tries to bring a sense of balance through a light tartness, but the candi sugar wins and it remains one of those extreme beers throughout pure sweetness.
Bluegrass Welts Bat Quad;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Bluegrass Brewing Company;GABF 2005: I’ll be honest, my notes on this aren’t real good - it was towards the end of the festival. It had a really sweet aroma with a combination of malt and maybe something fruity. It had a good head that stuck around but, not much for lacing. The taste was sweet with a dry after-taste.

Fredericksburg XIPA;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;IPA;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;I had this freshly brewed and it was super hopped! I could almost chew them. Great brew though. Loved it enough to get a growler.
Fredericksburg XIPA;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;IPA;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;Hazy orange with decent head. Citrus hoppy flavors dominate, with a resiny bitterness overpowering malty sweetness in the back. Bitter, but not harshly bitter, 100 IBU’s I’m told, and seems higher than 7.4%.
Fredericksburg XIPA;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;IPA;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;Another buttery IPA disaster. Sweet butter and creamy vanilla dominate the nose, almost moldy smelling at time, but to be fair it wasn’t too bad - a little butter or cream sometimes in an IPA is nice. This one is OK at best, but still drinkable. Palate is expectedly dry and bitter, with a lack of malt presense really, any sweetness being bittersweet dry hop oils. Flavors of rye and wheat compliment the sharp grassy hops. Appearance is a dark murky yellow and orange color, really a good looking beer but I can’t say it’s a winner taste-wise.
Snake River Cheyenne Sweet Stout;Jackson, Wyoming, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Snake River Brewing Co.;GABF 05. Pours black with an aroma of sweet chocolate and hops. Nice flavors of coffee, chocolate, and faint cherry in the finish. I liked this one.
Snake River Cheyenne Sweet Stout;Jackson, Wyoming, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Snake River Brewing Co.;Deep brown with a light tan/brown head. Sweet leafy and hoppy scents. Milky too.

Snake River Cheyenne Sweet Stout;Jackson, Wyoming, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Snake River Brewing Co.;GABF 2005: Good dark color with lots of head and lacing but, it didn’t last very long. Aroma was sweet with a hint of coffee but, not enough to kill it for me. Taste is where the coffee came in and killed me. I do have to say it was sweet coffee - duhh.
Flying Fish Vanilla Ice;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Flying Fish Brewing Company;very old notes from Kennet 05 - spicy and yeasty in the nose, pour was golden and cloudy, head was very thin. lots of spice and yeast in the flavor but not much vanila, thought the aftertaste was a lity bit bitter but also a little bit hot (guess you should expect that from a 14%)

Flying Fish Vanilla Ice;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Flying Fish Brewing Company;Draft at the Grey Lodge in Philly. I had this about an hour after it was tapped.

Arctic Craft Big Bear Honey Brown Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Arctic Craft Brewery;"GABF 2005: This was a mistake. I went to the wrong table and instead of letting them know I just picked something quick. The aroma was sweet but, I didn’t really smell the honey. It poured brown with a good off-white head. The taste was blaah; there just wasn’t much taste to it. I expected a little sweetness from the honey but, it wasn’t there."

Lake Placid Graces Summer Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;On tap at the Brewpub. Cloudy yellow pour that is attractive.

Lake Placid Graces Summer Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lake Placid Pub & Brewery;growler...crystal clear blonde pour with an enormous white head. Malty aroma, with a hint of banana. Crisp, resinous hop flavor to start. Thin mouthfeel, watery texture, kind of unpleasant bitterness that lingers. I detect a hint of banana somewhere middle/end. Certainly not the best example of a blonde/golden ale/summer ale I have tasted. Lacks complexity, reminiscent of your BMC macro light beers.

Dark Horse 3 Guys Running;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;This is only available at the brewpub. They take the second running mash from the 3 Guy Off the Scale Ale and used a Belgian yeast. This particular batch was aged in oak barrels for 6 months with 140 lbs. of peaches thrown into the brew during fermentation. Appears a murky browninsh amber with a small white head that fades into a collar. Smell is of oaky bourbon, vanilla, caramel, raisins.

The nose is a sweet, yeasty, yam-like aroma. It smells a lot like bread starter (theisti’s descriptor; I’m stealing it). Medium-bodied and soft, transitioning to a light graininess at the finish.

Mos Place Elm Street Porter;Beaver, Kansas, United States;Porter;Mo's Place Grill & BrewPub;5 ounce sample at the brewpub. Comes almost black with a decent tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate and a bit of coffee. Taste is very similar. Medium bodied. Interesting finish. Very drinkable.
Mos Place Elm Street Porter;Beaver, Kansas, United States;Porter;Mo's Place Grill & BrewPub;Rating #800. On tap at the brewpub. Pours jet black with a tall, creamy, light tan head picture perfect. This one is actually darker than their stout. The nose is of chocolate, coffee and mild roasted malt. On the light side of medium-bodied, the mouthfeel is flinty and lightly dry. (According to Len, the brewer/owner, the high amount of gypsum in the local water imparts this interesting quality on his beers.) Sweet roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and faint coffee with a mildly bitter finish. This is a tasty porter and my favorite of the brews that were on during our visit to Mo’s.
Mos Place Elm Street Porter;Beaver, Kansas, United States;Porter;Mo's Place Grill & BrewPub;5 oz taster at the BrewPub. Pour is black with ruby highlights with a nice khaki head. Nice lacing. Very pretty in the glass. Aroma of soft smoke and malted roasted cocoa. Taste is roasty, bittersweet cocoa and some bright pine hoppiness. Finish is minerally, the brewer mentioned there is a lot of gypsum in the water.
Mos Place Lights Out Stout;Beaver, Kansas, United States;Stout;Mo's Place Grill & BrewPub;Sampler at the brewpub. Yes, this is a brown colored stout. On top of that its all diacetyl - strong sweet buttered popcorn all over the place. Could not do more than 1-2 sniffs and 1-2 small sips. Worst beer at the brewpub.
Mos Place Lights Out Stout;Beaver, Kansas, United States;Stout;Mo's Place Grill & BrewPub;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights and a creamy, khaki head. The nose is of roasted dark malt backed by a sweet astringency. Light bodied and fairly thin (especially for the style) with tickling carbonation and a lightly astringent finish. Dry and (again) astringent with a sweet lactose-like hit but lacking the flavor/character of lactose. This is a decent stout, but I’d have to say it ranks at the bottom of my list of Mo’s brews.
Mos Place Lights Out Stout;Beaver, Kansas, United States;Stout;Mo's Place Grill & BrewPub;5 oz taster at the BrewPub. Pour is black brown copper with a tan head. Almost soda like carbonation. Aroma of sweet caramel and a hint of grassy mineral. Taste is caramelly sweet, some milkiness. Thin body for a stout. Mineral taste comes through on this in the finish.
Fitgers Fresh Hop IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Fitgers Brewhouse;Cask. The bartender told me that this was brewed with fresh local hops. Clear burnt orange pour, with a tinge of haze. Topped with a smooth and silky off-white head. Blast of fresh, sweet sugary hop aroma, with citrus and floral. Almost creamy aroma. Diacetyls hit me first in the flavor department. A caramel element, dosed with butterscotch. Finishes up with a bitingly fresh hop attack. Two obvious planes of delivery. First, a smooth, caramel buttery malt, followed by a swoop of fresh west coast like hops that don’t balance too well. Palate is hop dry.

Drinks with a burst of forward tangy/sourness up front, lightly effervescent, dry and tart blackberries, gooseberries, honey, 5/10-sweetness, finishing tart, off-dry, semi-smooth. Medium complexity, medium depth, okay transitions, okay drinkability. Good for a go once.

Tugwell Creek Solstice Metheglin;Sooke, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Tugwell Creek Honey Farm and Meadery;"Vintage 2006, 3 years old, parallel tasting with the Harvest Melomel Pale yellow color. Very interesting aroma, flowery, with spices (cinnamon), a touch of apples, plastic, vanilla. It has a medium sweet mouthfeel in the front, drier at the end; it reminds me a lot of stewed apple with some cinnamon, but it must be the ginger; lemony; the alcohol warmth is evident; the final is a bit astringent. Original one, extremely well balanced, and it’s nice to see how it dynamically changes from the start to the end of the experience."

Fox Ninas Mild;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Bottle. Exploded upon opening and was very lively when poured.Quite malty and slightly sulphuric. Nice to come across a bottled mild. Apart from the opening explosive event this was quite nice.
Fox Ninas Mild;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Cask Handpump at the Fat Cat, Sheffield 07/04/2007 Burnt roast aroma. Dark and smooth on the palate. Slightly fruity. Some dryness and bitterness in a crisp burnt roast finish.
Fox Ninas Mild;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Cask conditioned - handpump - Malt Shovel Northampton. A black coloured mildwith a real russet hue and a beige coloured head. The aroma is dry with roasted malts. The taste is burn and smoky. A decent amount of fruitiness also. An oily character. Nice.
Fox Ninas Mild;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Bottle conditioned, 500ml. Dark brown to black with volcanic malty head. I lost a third of the bottle by the time the beer had settled down, it had been stood still for a couple of weeks, so presumably its all additional fermentation occuring. Never mind, because it didn’t taste so great anyhow, there was a roughish tarry note overwhelming some fruitiness a harsh tobacco ash flavour, quite unrefined. How I wish I could have had the cask version.
Fox Ninas Mild;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Cask (handpump) at the Carlton Arms, Cambridge, May 2006. Garnet colour. Rather pale for a mild. Light coffee aroma. Slightly bitter and faintly acidic on the palate. Ashy, dry mouthfeel. Not entirely successful.

North Coast Old Plowshare Stout;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Dry;North Coast Brewing Company;Well....its organic which is a good thing. It's a little overpriced, which is a bad thing. Appearance is nice....super dark brown (almost black) with mocha frothy head. Mouthfeel could be better, but I usually find organic products slightly rougher and bland. Flavor is very malty (chocolate, coffee, and caramel), mildly hopped. Again, I'm not the biggest fan of organic coffee and there seems to be a lot of coffee in this so maybe that is where the balance/taste is off. I like a lot of stouts better than this, but enjoy supporting the organic community. Don't think I would buy this again, but it's a decent overall beer.
North Coast Old Plowshare Stout;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Dry;North Coast Brewing Company;"""slightly boring (and not as smooth in the finish) as old 38, but a solid effort anyway. worth trying a couple times, but i’m not sure why this one was necessary with two stouts already in the line."""
North Coast Old Plowshare Stout;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Dry;North Coast Brewing Company;Bottle from Whole Foods in Portland ME. Pretty straightforward dry stout. Good enough but nothing special.
North Coast Old Plowshare Stout;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Dry;North Coast Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy dark reddish brown color with a small foamy khaky head with decent retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, cream, and light herbal. Nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, vanilla, light coffee, and light herbal. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, toast, and light coffee, and light herbal on the finish for a short bit. Very nice robustness and balance of flavors; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice dry stout! Nice robust and balanced flavors; very smooth to drink. Really enjoyable offering."
North Coast Old Plowshare Stout;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Dry;North Coast Brewing Company;Bottles in the past. A fine WF-only stout. Very similar to their regular dry stout. Light ash, lots of roast, light molasses. Flavor shows more of A coffee presence, light cocoa, roast. Mildly goaty as it warms.
North Coast Old Plowshare Stout;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Dry;North Coast Brewing Company;Pretty good, but doesn’t compare to the Old 38. Somehow less dark, more nutty than chocolatey and more watery. Still, its tasty and I would never say no to it if offered.
North Coast Old Plowshare Stout;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Dry;North Coast Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle from Beer Run, 5/8/12. I never tried this back when it was available at my WFM store, so I’m glad to see it now. Pours a clear very dark brown color with a thin fizzy tan head that fades quickly. Aroma of dark malts, treacle, toffee, chocolate and some roastiness. The taste is chocolate, roasted malts, nutty notes, herbal hops. Medium bodied. Dark with an almost chewy texture and seems oxidized, though it is new at the store. Huh.
North Coast Old Plowshare Stout;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Dry;North Coast Brewing Company;"Interesting dry stout with notes of milk chocolate, milk chocolate, milk chocolate, and.... am I drinking milk chocolate? Well the beer is pretty tasty and drinkable but one dimensional and kind of ""organic"" tasting."
North Coast Old Plowshare Stout;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Dry;North Coast Brewing Company;This is milk chocolate, or couldnjust taste like that cause I just drank ash water. This is actually pretty tasty,
North Coast Old Plowshare Stout;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Stout - Dry;North Coast Brewing Company;Bottle poured into a pint glass is black with a thin tan head. Aromas of roasted malt and coffee. Taste is coffee and toast. Body is thin and weak. Overall not one I would have again.

Goose Island October Red;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Reddish brown. No aroma. The flavor was spicy with floral undertones. Hoppy with a bitter aftertaste.
Goose Island October Red;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Reddish brown with a meager head, this actually was more flavorful than I’d expected from the aroma..... since there barely is one. The body is a bit thin, but the flavor rebounds somewhat with a fruity, caramel malt taste, slightly nutty, and complemented by a rye-induced peppery spiciness. The finish is a bit weak, some caramel sweetness and a light hop bitterness. Goose Island Beer Company - Clybourn, Chicago, IL
Goose Island October Red;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap, Sunday morning after with TAR: More amber than red with a small frothy head. The aroma has notes of caramel and toasty malts, nice aromatic bitters, rye bread, and twangy apricot and lemon esters. WOW, a nice rye bite on top of the mild sweet malt backbone. This was followed by a pine bitter balance and citric finish. I was caught off guard by this amount of flavor in what I figured would be just another run of the mill Irish Red brew. The mouthfeel is crisp and sharp at first before leading dry earthy finsh. I dig this, great use of rye. Bravo!
Goose Island October Red;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Clybourn. Pours light orange with a small head. Not much in the way of aroma. Malts dominate the taste with light hops in the background. Finishes slightly bitter. Nothing spectacular but very drinkable.
Goose Island October Red;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draught, Clybourn Brewpub (2005 version): a wonderful autumn orange brown colour, under a decent (especially for the GI pourers) off-tan head. Toasted, fall (gourd) fruitness with a surprising amount of hops and orange juice sweetness. A strong floral malt flavour makes this one oddly pleasant – or perhaps that is the lack of decent beer I have had in the past few weeks…
Goose Island October Red;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);A trilling combination of deep amber and fiery red with a thin, tan head. The aroma gives an nice interplay of malt and hops. The toast nuts, whole grains, caramel and mild fruit speak to the layered malts. There is a cool spiciness that likely comes from the varied hops and the rye malt. Earthy spiciness, mild pine, lemon zest and a touch of floral perfume. The body is pretty full, giving the tongue hints that cool weather is on the way. The carbonation, while low, is fairly prickly on the tongue. The flavors just didn’t do all that much for me. The hops become the dominate factor, creating a rather surprising bitterness. At times, the tongue yearns for more malty sweetness to contrast the bitterness. All told, this is not undrinkable, but doesn’t excite me enough to go back for more.

Apollo Free Beer 2.0;Copenhagen, Denmark;Flavored - Fruit;Bryggeriet Apollo;This is a development from Skands Free Beer 3.0, which is a development from Apollo Free Beer 2.0. A hazy brownish amber beer with a thin brown head. The aroma is sweet with strong notes of caramel, as well as notes of yeast, brewmash, chocolate, and some spices, I guess that it is the added Guarana, that gives it these notes. The flavor is sweet and very spicy, but also with notes of chocolate, herbs, and nuts, again it must be from the Guarana. The end is dry with a slight roasted note. A quite interesting beer.

Aroma of chocolate and toasted malts, grain, and some leather. Aroma adds some brown sugar, otherwise the same as the aroma. Light to medium body with moderate carbonation. This is probably one of their better offerings consistently on tap.
Jobbers Canyon Docs Brown Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Brown Ale;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;Big thanks goes out to SledgeJr for treating me to this (and one more) round! Poured a usual brown color for such an ale, nice thin head, although lacing was only average to weak. The aroma was sweet light chocolate and nuts. The flavor was malty sweet chocolate and nuts. Mouthfeel was moderate to thin for the style, but the sweetness kept it from feeling too light. A very simple take on the style, a little sweet, yet enjoyable. Much thanks to Todd!!!
Jobbers Canyon Docs Brown Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Brown Ale;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;On draft at the brewpub, 3/11/06: Yep it’s brown. Small, almost sticky head. Almost no aroma and almost no flavor. It’s clean and smooth and any mere mortal, casual beer drinker could pound these. It’s almost good.

Jobbers Canyon Docs Brown Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Brown Ale;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;"On tap at the brewpub. Had this on opening day. Pours a light amber ""brown"" ala Newcastle. Decent head retention. Good lacing to the glass. Aroma is good with a slight nutty character. Carbonation provides a respectable tongue tingle. Flavor is smooth and malty making this an easy to drink beer. has a detectable bitterness. Not as good as the pale ale served here, but the second best currently being poured. A solid beer."
Jobbers Canyon Fatty Flynn Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Brewpub. Black with off-white nitro head. Very toasty aroma. Palate is dry and smooth. Flavor is of roasted malts, with chocolate and coffee notes. Very drinkable but unremarkable.
Jobbers Canyon Fatty Flynn Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, Spring ’06. Clear mahogany red with a nitro two finger brown head. Aroma of roasted malts, then coffee, then bitter chocolate, and lastly some grain. Flavor added a little raisins, otherwise the same as the aroma with moderate bitterness. Finished with a little earth and chalk. Low carbonation with a thin and watery body.
Jobbers Canyon Fatty Flynn Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;"1/31/06, draft at the brewpub. This was my first visit and this was my second beer of the three I tried. Compared to the other two, this was the only passable offering. I found this to have a nice curb appeal; pitch black with a thin but firm tan head. The aroma was an inviting espresso. The flavor was of lightly bittered coffee. It has a relatively creamy consistency but was slightly thin-bodied."
Jobbers Canyon Fatty Flynn Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;(Draught) Pours a dark mahogany body with a small tan head. Aroma of chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee. Flavor of mild roasted malt and chocolate with a bit too watery finish.
Jobbers Canyon Fatty Flynn Stout;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Stout;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;"On tap at the brewpub on opening day. The commercial description calls this ""smooth and creamy with hints of coffee and cocoa."" Unfortunately, on the day I had this the stout was not quite ready to serve to the public and I think the brewer (Dean Dobmeier) knows it. The flavor is excellent. No head at all. Black beer. Little carbonation. Seems lighter than Dean’s Ryan’s Stout made at the defunct Jones Street Brewery if my memory serves me well. Aroma is flawless of roasted stout goodness. I suspect that my rating will improve with the next batch of this. UPDATE 2/1/6: Just had a pint of this during the Wanda Jackson performance at the Jobber’s. This is simply not the same beer as I had on opening day. It now has a beautiful thick creamy head that remains until last gulp. The roasted chocolate flavor also yields a discernable calcium sulfate salty taste. The balance and body is vastly improved and this renders quite a smooth and pleasurable stout to drink. Definitely the best stout made in Omaha today. UPDATE 11/2006: Lacing? This beer does not have lacing, IT HAS DRY WALL!!! Remarkably thick head. The stout is fairly sweet right now. Still delicious."
Jobbers Canyon Kaisers Dunkelweizen;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, 11/2 and 11/3/06. A dark red brew. Cloying banana breadiness, sweet and raisiny, with the overlaying yeastiness. Sledge, go try it again! Good.
Jobbers Canyon Kaisers Dunkelweizen;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub on opening day. Looks a sludgy mud-colored dark brown with the unfiltered yeast. The flavor tastes like a lager yeast, but all the beers made here are ales to my understanding. Has good lacing. Clove scent is detectable. Pronounced bread dough flavor. Odd to me, but that may be because it was not lagered?
Jobbers Canyon Oktoberfest;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub, 11/2/06: An amber beer. Fruity with a hint of fruit ... apple? Almost tangerine. Tart and tangy, not a bad interpretation of a fest.
Jobbers Canyon Oktoberfest;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub on opening day. Has the obligatory amber appearance of a märzen that Americans expect, but lacks the crisp white head (my glass lacked any head at all). Sweet flavor and taste of carapils malt. However, this is an ale and not a true märzen. An OK beer, but I don’t think that I would want a maß of this. UPDATE 11/2006: Dark gold to light amber in color. Has a quick white head. Aroma is of an orange melt-away chocholate candy from Baker’s confectionery. Malty and cloying. Has a pronounced berry flavor. Mild residual bitterness. Lovely higher alcohol and hoppy twist at the end than last year’s batch.
Jobbers Canyon Stanleys Tip Top Pale Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, Spring ’06. Clear amber yellow with a one finger eggshell head. Aroma of pine, light citrus, and caramel malts. Pine is the same throughout as the aroma, moderate bitterness, finishes biscuity. High carbonation, light to medium bodied. Not too bad of an offering.
Jobbers Canyon Stanleys Tip Top Pale Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Golden with a whitehead. Baked goods in the aroma. Smells sticky sweet. Not much hops. Fruity. Flavor starts very bready. Pilsbury orange cream cinnimon rolls. Not in a good way. Fruity. Okay bitterness. On the heavy side. Just not very good at all.
Jobbers Canyon Stanleys Tip Top Pale Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;On draft at the brewpub, 3/11/06: This is an orange beer with a red tinge and absolutely zero head. It gives off no discernable aroma. I think it has a really bad soapy taste. Me no likey. Think I’ll stick to Upstream.

Jobbers Canyon Stanleys Tip Top Pale Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;"On tap at the brewpub on opening day.

Aroma is neat: hoppy and fruity berries. Flavor is crisp and clean with a slight citrus undertone and a pronounced berry flavor. Currently the best beer sold here."
Jobbers Canyon Underworld Anna Wheat;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, Spring ’06. Hazy pale straw with a one finger fading creamy white head. Aroma of lightly worn gym sock and some grain. Flavor continues to be grainy with some light citrus and a cormy wheaty finish. Highly carbonated with a light body. A fair offering.
Jobbers Canyon Underworld Anna Wheat;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;(Draught) Pours a cloudy yellow body with a moderate white head. MIld malty aroma. Flavor of malt and mild lemon with a creamy mouthfeel.
Jobbers Canyon Underworld Anna Wheat;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Jobbers Canyon Restaurant & Brewery;"On tap at the brewpub on opening day. The commercial description states: ""A crisp light beer made with wheat malt in addition to barley malt. This beer is unfiltered so there is a slight haze present."" This looks like a wit bier. It pours a cloudy white-pale yellow in color with a nice white head. Head has good retention. Great lacing. Good banana esters to the flavor. Immediate crisp finish that leaves you with a little lemony tang. Not my favorite style, but should be more pleasing to others who like a light body beer."
Mash House Holy Smokes!;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Frothy beige head tops a hazy dark brown hue. Extremely mellow smokiness disappoints up front while strong aromatic earthy and limey hops destroy the caramel maltiness. Flavors turn out quite cola-ish in mouth, while the palate is plainly watery, acetic, astringent. Problematic.
Murphys Wagon Wheel Dark Bock;Hastings, Nebraska, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Murphys Wagon Wheel Microbrewery & Pub;It too bad. Dark in color as name describes. Murphy generally only has it during the winter months and I’m not so sure if he’s not shutting the brewing down for good...
Murphys Wagon Wheel Light Wheat;Hastings, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Murphys Wagon Wheel Microbrewery & Pub;Pleasent smell, and nice coft golden color. Depending on the time of year you get it the head is moderate if there is any. Taste like a those store bought pouches for at home brewing. Horrid in taste. Murphy get a new recipe for this please! I’m a big fan of wheats but this is not my deal. Try the bock though.

Kikusui Junmai Ginjo Sake;Shibata-shi, Nigata-ken, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Kikusui Brewing Company;Odd flavors. In Sushi restaurant while waiting for food to go. So not with food. It is good and no harm. Not at all amazing. Negative is the taste after is like plastic. Some sips were very tasty like flower water with white rose petals. I can imagine that last flavor would be more like orange or tangerine if eating between tastes. I was purposely tasting it around my tongues with various amounts of air. The bad aftertaste is sort of like Bacardi white rum.
Kikusui Junmai Ginjo Sake;Shibata-shi, Nigata-ken, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Kikusui Brewing Company;Bottle - Aromatic rice and yeasty notes. Light and creamy with a touch of sweetness and rice. Easy drinking.
Kikusui Junmai Ginjo Sake;Shibata-shi, Nigata-ken, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Kikusui Brewing Company;This is one of those few sakes in which there is a clear indication in English advising us that it is a Junmai Ginjo. You know how difficult it is to try to figure out from a non-export version, eh? And I’m not sure why people are so hard on this one. It is indeed sweet and milk and suave. Well, smoothness is a quality. It can certainly be a welcome feature.

John Shippeys Justins Pale Ale (JPA);Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;IPA;John Shippeys Brewing Company;Available only on tap at John Shippeys brewpub. Pours light amber with a very nice frothy head. Aroma is fairly strong hop, Lemon and Orange rind with some eucalyptus/pine. Flavours are also very pleasant - Moslty hope and grapefruit. somewhat creamy to the palate with a fairly dry finish. I’ve been told that this beer was actually created by a mistake from the assistant brewmaster - I wish I made mistakes like that once is a while...
John Shippeys Justins Pale Ale (JPA);Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;IPA;John Shippeys Brewing Company;On Tap at the food court. Deep golden with nice everlasting frothy white head. Hop nose, from 2 feet away. Nothing but hops in the aroma, maybe a bit of fresh homemade bread. Flavor is nice & bitter with a bit of malt flavor finishing off with a nice mouthfull of grapefruit, pine & citrus hops...I was impressed.
John Shippeys Justins Pale Ale (JPA);Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;IPA;John Shippeys Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Golden amber colour with a fully lasting creamy and frothy off-white head. Citrus laden aroma, primarily tangerine and lime, with pine and floral notes. Very light cereal or toast-like malts with an assertive and lingering grapefuirt and piny bitter finish. Medium bodied, finishes dry letting the bitterness linger. No surprise that it feels more hoppy than Shippey’s Left Coast given the reduced amount of Crystal malt but still makes a very decent IPA.
Rock Bottom Portland Saison des Vin;Portland, Oregon, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Portland;"Draught@brewpub (Portland, OR) They called it just a ""Saison"". Clear yellow color, small white head. Fruity saison yeasty aroma. Light-bodied. Fruity, spicey flavor. Wyeast Saison yeast used? Quite typical brewpub/""homebrew"" Saison."
Rock Bottom Portland Saison des Vin;Portland, Oregon, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Portland;Tap @ Rock Bottom... Poured clear orange with a white head. A decent, dry, crisp and refreshing saison. Notes of lavender, apricot, lemon zest, and cotton candy. Creating a sweet, wheaty, and slightly estery beer.
Rock Bottom Portland Saison des Vin;Portland, Oregon, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Portland;Pours cloudy orange with a small white head. Crisp and spicy aroma with a citrus floral note. Carbonation was very high bringing out the esters and yeast spiciness. Finish was a bit acidic and had a woody wine flavor. There was also an interesting tea note to the finish.
Rock Bottom Portland Saison des Vin;Portland, Oregon, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Portland;Very fruity aroma is saturated by vanilla and oak. Hazy dark golden body is topped with a low, off white head that lasts. Fruity and woody flavour with a strong vanilla character and some doughlike yeast. Light tartness becomes apparent in the vinous finish. Medium body with moderately lively carbonation. Interesting idea but the flavours don’t come together and the barrel perhaps overwhelms the beer. Sampled at GABF 2005.
Rock Bottom Portland Saison des Vin;Portland, Oregon, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Portland;Creamy, lasting ivory head covers the dulled cloudy golden hue. Almost absent maltiness is compensated by wheaty notes, literally dwarfed by a solid limey and earthy hoppiness. The oak-aging contributes corky white wine character, but the finish comes very fast and doesn`t leave much of an impression. Nevertheless, refreshingly tart and nowhere near astringent. Sweet and thin. It was a good idea and I can see russian river doing amazing stuff in that vein, but we have more work to do here: How to integrate hoppiness, how to integrate more yeasty funkiness etc. because this is obviously not aiming at your average BMC drinker.
Rock Bottom Portland Saison des Vin;Portland, Oregon, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Portland;GABF 2005. Head is mostly lasting. Body is hazy dark yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), with notes of banana, sherry, and wood. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. I give them props for trying something interesting, but the oxidation and rather un-saisonish character left me disappointed.
Franklins Batch # 200;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;IPA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;On tap. A very deep and hazy amber with a medium-sized tan head that lasts and lasts and leaves rings of lace. Citrusy aroma of grapefruits along with some caramel and pine. Medium-bodied and quite creamy. Very well-balanced taste. A sweet, almost nutty caramel and malty base with a very citrusy, hoppy, bitter and dry finish that lingers. Hints of alcohol at the end. Almost barley wine-ish. Solid effort.
Franklins Batch # 200;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;IPA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;"Draft... Very hazy, caramel-colored ale with a small, creamy, off-white head. Decent retention. Light citrus nose with very light evergreen. Either my nose is dead or the beer has lost some hop ""pop"" with age. Moderately bitter and lightly tangy flavors laid upon a solid malt base. Caramel and pink grapefruit. Medium to full-bodied and velvety with lively carbonation. Finishes lightly bitter."

Nothing unusual, but a very well done, nicely balanced beer.
Franklins Batch # 200;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;IPA;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;Draft - This style could easily have fallen under Best Bitter or IPA. Deep cloudy coppers and browns, creamy light tan head. The nose was an interesting mix of rich fruity hop esters, molasses, toffee brittle, and pineapple, with a very slight nutty tone. Flavor is front hop loaded, with more fruity English hops, some Americans ones definitely noted as well, and a light chocolate malt rounding it out for balance. 7.5% is undetectable. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, bittersweet finish. Congrats on # 200. A great session brew....

New Albanian Hoptimus;New Albany, Indiana, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;New Albanian Brewing Company;Pours a copper color with a blend of red and orange. The head has a nice retention and the foam sticks to my glass. The aroma is of crisp malts and has defined hop notes. The hops had citrus, minor spice, very resinous, and grassy scents. While tasting I picked up on sugary malted grains, a bitter bite, and booze. The body was medium and it had a good finish that did not linger too long. Nothing really stands out here. Its a good beverage but not one I’d search to have again.

Strong caramelly malt backbone supporting an even stronger hop load: grapefruit, black currant, black pepper, pine resin. Fruity. Tangy.

Wynkoop El Hefe Weizenbock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Wynkoop Brewing Company;On tap. Pours slightly cloudy medium brown. Good head retention. Yeasty aroma. Palate is dry and dusty. Sampled again about a month later and was much clearer. Banana bread flavors predominate.
Wynkoop El Hefe Weizenbock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Wynkoop Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a very dirty light brown cloud of a mess. Similar to the dust cloud that follows Pig Pen around in those Peanuts cartoons. Aroma is nice: bananas and baking bread. The flavors are yeasty banana and cloves. Not as thick in taste as it appears, still a fairly satisfying brew. I’d drink it again.

Wynkoop El Hefe Weizenbock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy dark amber opaque with a dense, frothy tan head. Aroma of sweet bready German yeast with good wheat and clove notes. Body starts full and yeasty with a mild sweetness and lots of spicy clove and some banana esters toward a drier doughy finish. Good weizenbock, but could use a little more sweetness.
Wynkoop El Hefe Weizenbock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Tap @ Wynkoop: This was so murky and yeasty it was opaque. It looked like brown mustard with a large stiff head that lasted until the beer was gone. The head was thick and slimy. This beer was still fermenting. I think the head was top floc yeast. There were small pockets of clear beer forming between the head and the yeast farm. The aroma was all banana and yeast with a citrusy tartness. The flavor was fruity and had notes of banana. Light spice on the finish. The finish was moderately bitter. Dry with a medium body. I would give the appearance a higher school if this was a school science project.

Wynkoop El Hefe Weizenbock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub, GABF weekend. Nice hazy brown muddiness with a thin but sticky foam top. The aroma is almost banana creme pie. As it drinks, the banana essence stays in the background, with the yeasty side playing the leading role. Finishes with a sharp biting bitterness that lingers. Very nice representation of the style. (#3137, 10/12/2007)
Wynkoop El Hefe Weizenbock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Quite a potent beer here. Very rich aroma with lots of clove, banana, and even malt. Beer is very sweet, but not cloying. Body is full. Wow, good stuff.
Wynkoop Mister Fister IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Tap at Falling Rock. Pours hazy orange with an average, creamy white head, mostly lasting with excellent lacing. Aroma is average malt (bread, cookie), heavy hops (flowers, perfume, pine, spruce), light yeast with notes of alcohol, pear, peach, and pineapple. Full bodied, creamy texture, average carbonation, and a bitter finish. Long duration, moderate sweetness and acidity, heavy bitterness.
Wynkoop Mister Fister IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Wynkoop Brewing Company;"falling rock. meduum burnt orange, faint haze. nose is a little heavy with brown and crystal malt; hops are oily, somewhat toasted or lightly charred. bitterness is medium for the style; texture is medium up front but dissipates across the back. semi-sweet bartlett pear, cookie dough and mild caramel. not a disaster."
Wynkoop Mister Fister IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Wynkoop Brewing Company;On tap at Falling Rock poured a hazy goden amber with a lasting amber head. Aromas of pine, earthjiness, grapefruit, tangerine and light biscuit. Palte was medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of biscuit, pine, earhiness and grapefruit with a smooth dry lingering bitter finish.
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2005;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours a hazy orange amber, topped with a huge head of rocky, cream-colored, soft and sudsy foam. Superb head retention and lacing. Hoppy aroma of citrus with an herbal zing. Smells delicious! The flavor is dominated by the hops, as expected. Plenty of crisp, clean, green, and bitter citrus hops to go around. Lots of bitter grapefruit, with fresh lemon and a mild pine hop flavor in the finish. These same flavors in the aftertaste linger forever. Well behind the hoppiness is a mild malt presence. Try as I might (and I’ve mightily tried a couple pints, a growler, and a few samples at the Autumn Brew Review), I can’t pinpoint a malt flavor. But it is there – if only for balance and body. And to tell you the truth, that’s all I am interested in from a fresh hop beer anyway. Medium body, amply but gently carbonated, and fairly smooth.
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2005;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On-tap at the brewpub: Clouded and hazy goldish yellow with a small white cap of smooth froth. Great lacing is placed all throughout the glass as its comsumed in the patterns of snowflakes and bigger splotches. Aroma is quite nice and pungent at first, very citrusy fruity with clean popping hops. Nice hints to underlying pine and grasses sweep up under the lemony citrus as does some toffee and cereal-like malting which tends to add a bit of dry biscuity grainyness. Its got a great nose, the only thing was it tended to fade by midglass. Flavors are nearly the same from what comes out of the smell with a very well balanced and toned brigade of evenly handled hops where mild lemony citrus makes the mainstay with very clean bitterness with a light toffee backing and grass edged pineyness in some of the late effects of the middle and finish. The finish continues to breathe new life into its composition as the fluffy cereal-like biscuit dry malting adds some nice nuances over the end of the clean and easy bittering citric hops. Feel is quite clean given its unfiltered nature in appearance, light on the buds mostly, which is amazing to behold as its flavors really make thier way around with ease due to that overall lighter-like body. Drinkablity is down right simple, easy, and clean. By the pint. Yes. And more so! Damnable. Drinkable! Yum! And at only 4.8% this is sessionable by leaps and bounds!
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2005;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Dirty Orange/Brown Coloring with White Skin. Citrusy Wet Hop Aroma. Medium Mouthfeel. Really Expressive Fountain of Hops, Light Malt Background and Citrus All The Way Through. Not Too Piney.... with a Dry Aftertaste.
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2005;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"This gets a five for appearance. RAYBOY01 brought back a growler from Minneapolis and poured me a slightly hazy, deep orange ale with a sustained creamy head. During the pour there was a ""plop,"" a sound I normally don’t care for in my beers... but out dropped a large hop cone. This exemplified the drink, strong grapefruit, orange, and pine hop smells over a caramel malt. The hop bitterness in the taste is what most brewers shoot for in their IPAs, but here it was in Town Hall’s APA atop a sturdy malt backbone. Nice prolonged bitter finish. Great brew! From RAYBOY01’s Fridge"
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2005;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Intense Cascade grapefruit/orange hop aroma, promising much...Wonderfully attractive deep orange pour with a huge, long-lasting off-white head. Rich roasted caramel malt sweetness more than offset by HUGE pine/grapefruit/orange/resin hop bitterness...Hoppiness seems to subside somewhat in the finish. Very Most Excellent!!! I know! I know! The hop cone in the growler is a gimmick....but it’s a gimmick I LIKE! A LOT!!!
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2005;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"This looks like their excellent Masala Mama IPA; dark and cloudy. A crisp and clean beer, dominated by hops, but balanced by malt. A nice alternative to the strictly hop flavored beers these guys sometimes put out. Loads of citrus, and this leads to a little sourness. Very good."
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2005;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Very dark copper color with a thin head. Strong aroma of citrus, predominantly orange. Holy mother of hops! Uber-hops in this one, but thankfully there is a substantial malt base to avoid the overpowering bitterness, which is not nearly as much as one might expect. More citrusy than floral or pine.
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2005;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Big, bold, fresh cascade hops in the aroma and taste of this wonderful pale. The malt is in the background but its sweetness prevents the hop from being caustic. I gave it a 5 for appearance since the dark orange, unfiltered body and dense head were gorgeous and inviting. The hop cone that popped out of the growler’s first pour and into my glass was a great addition. I’m glad I was warned before...
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2005;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Made with Cascade hops, 150 pounds of them, freshly picked and rushed to the brewery, with 5 hop additions, and a filtration through a ""hop tea."" Hazed orange coloration, firm, lasting off-whitish, rocky head. Most promising appearance. Aroma is all Cascade’s citric zest and pine, lemon rind, forest leaves, and pure splendor in the grass. Fresh hoppitude dominates the taste, and the brew boards the palate boldly, lively and utterly lovely. Huge hop appeal, hop fanatics are in store for a true delight in this one! The flavor lasts long in the mouth, and when the glass is done, it lingers in the memory, as well. Hops please the tongue with each new meeting of lip and glass, and the pure pleasure never stops. full bodied, long, fresh finish, all hop pleasure..can’t go wrong with this one! Just delicious. This is what craft beer is all about! P.S. I later enjoyed more from a growler, and they left a little something inside...I’ll let you guess what..."
Tommyknocker Green Chile;Idaho Springs, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Tommyknocker Brewery;From a 12 oz. can. Pours a hazy gold with a thick off white head. Aromas of green chili. Flavors are more sweet than hot although there is a lingering heat on the finish.
Tommyknocker Green Chile;Idaho Springs, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Tommyknocker Brewery;Can, best by May 11th 2019. Pours a straw gold, decent head of foam, umm...I see black floaties. What's up with that?? Smells like an AAL, grainy, corny, only the slightest bit of a hint of any heat. Taste is watery, lightest of light hints of chile. Mishandled can? Maybe. Light and watery mouthfeel. I can't believe how bad this is.
Tommyknocker Green Chile;Idaho Springs, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Tommyknocker Brewery;"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 8/24/2015. Pours slightly hazy medium golden/yellow color with a small fairly dense white head with decent retention, that reduces to a minimal spotty cap that lingers. Minimal lacing on the glass. Good appearance. Aromas of red/green chile peppers, skin/seeds, cracker, white bread dough, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of chile peppers, pale malts, and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of big red/green chile peppers, skin/seeds, cracker, white bread dough, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal/grassy hop bitterness and pepper spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of red/green chile peppers, skin/seeds, cracker, white bread dough, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of chile peppers, pale malts, and mild earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitter/spiciness. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, zero yeast notes preset. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as wexpected of 5.3%. Slightly increasing pepper heat through the glass, never overwhelming. Overall this is a very good pepper spiced pale lager. All around nice robustness and balance of chile peppers, pale malts, and mild earthy hop flavors; very smooth, clean, and quite refreshing to drink with the mellowly bitter/spicy finish. Very flavorful and no overdone on the peppers. Clean balanced pils malts, peppers, and mild earthy hops. A very enjoyable offering, and well made style example."

Tommyknocker Green Chile;Idaho Springs, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Tommyknocker Brewery;12 oz. bottle. Pours a clear, orange color, with a small, fleeting, white head. Lovely, mild Chile aroma, with some background notes of bread dough, caramel, and honey. Sweet and malty, with a very mild bitterness and a low, pleasant heat. Light body, with a smooth, syrupy, and a little acidic mouthfeel. This is a wonderful exhibition of green chilies, without overwhelming heat or terrible raw veggie flavor. Very nice.
Tommyknocker Green Chile;Idaho Springs, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Tommyknocker Brewery;12 oz bottle. At the Tommyknocker, Helsinki, Finland. Clear deep golden color with a small white head. Chili, vegetables and mild vinegar in the aroma. Chili (without burn), vegetables, malt, tea and dryness in the flavor. Chili should be much more present. Watery.
Tommyknocker Green Chile;Idaho Springs, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Tommyknocker Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Pours a clear orange gold with medium frothy white head that lasts. The aroma is strong chilis and lime zest. Thin, wheat, lime, nice heat from chilis, very good.
Tommyknocker Green Chile;Idaho Springs, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Tommyknocker Brewery;Tallahassee, Fl - Beer Stop - 12 oz bottle. Slight murkiness to the light golden pour, faint, bubbly off-white head. Earthy aroma of Anaheim Chile peppers, a bit of topsoil. Flavor has a nice pepper burn to it, some gumball sweetness, a bit of earthiness. Nice burn going down, but not distracting. Decent.
Tommyknocker Green Chile;Idaho Springs, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;Tommyknocker Brewery;Bottle. Green chile/bell pepper and light malt aroma. Golden yellow with small head. Sweet green bell pepper/chile, light biscuit malt, and mildly bitter hay flavor. Slight heat in finish. Okay - if you like the taste of peppers.
Americas Bourbon Barrel Chocolate Beer;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Americas Brewpub;Sampled at the Festival of Wood and Barrel Aged Beer at Goose Island, Nov.11, 2005. Lighter golden ale with good carbonation, and creamy white head. Chcocolate Quick in aroma and light alcohol. Interesting rich white chocolate and vanilla, alcohol warmth and smooth hops. Quite nice. Rich and smooth.
Americas Bourbon Barrel Chocolate Beer;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Americas Brewpub;Really not a fan of this one...seemed overly sweet with a peculiarly artificial tasting chocolate component...almost a chocolate extract thing going on. Somewhat cloying on the tongue. needless to say, though, I loved the bourbon aftertaste.
Americas Bourbon Barrel Chocolate Beer;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Americas Brewpub;Sampled at the Festival of Wood and Barrel Aged Beer at Goose Island. Most of the chocolate flavored beers I’ve had have been stouts or other strong, dark beers. This was a light amber body beneath a small white head. Chocolate immediately hits the nose. Nice, sweet, creamy chocolate. Ghirardelli chocolate singing lead with a bourbon backup. Light to medium bodied and somewhat thin, the flavor was still rewarding, like chocolate truffles laced with bourbon. I have to say that this was a favorite of mine for the day and it had nothing to do with the attractive brunette doing the pouring.
Americas Bourbon Barrel Chocolate Beer;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Americas Brewpub;This is a strange brew. The brewery’s chocolate flavored golden ale, which I don’t much care for, was aged in a bourbon barrel for several months. There is still a predominantly sweet chocolate nose, but it is mellowed by the blending with bourbon, vanilla, and a woody smokiness. The flavor is pretty much like bourbon-flavored milk chocolate candies topped with vanilla frosting. It a peculiarly not unpleasant flavor. It finishes on a sweet, bourbon laden note. Strange. America’s Brewpub, Aurora, IL
Americas Thoroughbred Red;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Americas Brewpub;For those of you who like Killian’s Irish Red or Leinenkugel’s Red, this is for you. Great malt flavor and sweetness without hop bitterness, flavor, or aroma. So read the commercial description at the brewpub. Apparently, this is not for me. There’s sweet caramel and toffee in the aroma and taste. Little else. I like more in a beer. America’s Brewpub, Aurora, IL
Americas Bourbon Barrel Scottish Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Americas Brewpub;Cellared 12 oz. bottle from the Sixth Annual FoWBAB(2008) B601 #082306, 26 months in a 12 year old Heaven Hill barrel, shared & poured to snifters showing a cloudy, mid- brown color, with not too much activity in the head & lacing department. The nose was toasted, but mainly sweet caramel, and vanilla. Medium+ bodied, the alcohol was still present, but mellowed warmth, sweetness remained, with a touch of tartness to the finish. Having sampled it at the event, and after reviewing old notes, I noticed that many of the Scotch & barrel attributes had faded, along with bolder bitterness & alcohol expression, but it retained a decent texture, remained quite tasty, and aged gracefully for all at our tasting to enjoy.
Americas Bourbon Barrel Scottish Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Americas Brewpub;"Sample poured from a bottle at FOBAB 2010. Labeled ""Why’s It Sooo Loud Scotch Ale"" at the event. Pours a murky copper color with greenish brown tints and a small tan head. Weird looking. Notes of raisins, vanilla, bourbon, sugar, smoked oak, caramel malts, butterscotch, and toast. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sticky mouthfeel. Very much like a barley wine."
Americas Bourbon Barrel Scottish Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Americas Brewpub;Bottled at FoBAB, aged for 26 months! Poured medium caramelly-amber with a long-lived cap of beige head. The aroma picked up sweet smoky caramel and bourbon upfront with vanilla and candied caramel behind. The flavor had sweeter aged caramel and toffee surrounded by vanilla and sweet bourbon notes (entirely complementary).. sweet butterscotch and vanilla on the warm finish.. tasty! Medium-bodied with adequate carbonation on the palate.. near-perfect barrel integration. Great brew.
Americas Bourbon Barrel Scottish Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Americas Brewpub;"FoBAB 2007: Coppery brown with a small head poured from a bottle. The aroma has notes of vanilla, oak, peat, smoke, grassy and herbal, phenolic. The taste has a sharp boozy start with a caramel malt base. It also has an ""old ale"" characteristic that I found pleasurable. Smoky and woody upon the finish. This sharp and lush beer was yet again another surprise from this brewer. I need to try more of the beers Mike brews. Bravo!"
Americas Bourbon Barrel Scottish Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Americas Brewpub;Wonderful barrel-aged entry by this brewer...with it’s upfront smokiness/peaty maltiness/and bourbony alcohol notes...I could drink these all night!
Americas Bourbon Barrel Scottish Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Americas Brewpub;Americas certainly impressed me with their three offerings at the Festival of Wood and Barrel Aged Beers in Chicago. This hazy brown body with a faint beige head brought a complex nose of the expected bourbon and word from the casks and notes of vanilla, toffee, and a touch of smoke. Medium bodied with a gentle carbonation. The flavor featured the bourbon warmth tempered with the smooth sweetness of the toffee and vanilla. Must plan some trips to Americas.
Americas Bourbon Barrel Scottish Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Americas Brewpub;FoBAB ’05- Pours out a light murky brownish color with a brim for a head. The nose is where its at with this brew, wonderful bourbon aroma that mixes in with the wood flavor very well. Caramel, some toffee, and a slight hint of smoke. Flavor is solid also, bringing the alcohol out a bit more working wonders with the toffee making for a real nice treat.
Americas Bourbon Barrel Scottish Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Americas Brewpub;This is an exquisite beer, and I want to thank braumeister Mike Rybinski for treating me to this excellent ale. Not much too look at, a golden brown body with a white film in lieu of a head, it treats in every other category. The aroma is a masterful blend between a dominant bourbon, peat-smoked malt, vanilla, hardwood, and alcohol. Very thick and incredibley smooth, it drinks like a fine liquer. Hot with alcohol, the Bourbon and Scotch blend continue to delight along with rich toffee, smoke, vanilla, and an earthy woodiness. It finishes on a sticky, hot, smokey sweet alcoholic note. This should be in bottles! Note to brewpub owners: Stop forcing your brewmasters to pander to the BMC crowd who won’t appreciate your cole efforts anyway. Let the brewers loose to create great beers like this. America’s Brewpub, Aurora, IL
Pittsfield Brew Works Raspberry Beret;Pittsfield, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pittsfield Brew Works;"On tap at the brewpub with a 4oz sample. Aroma is sweet, sticky raspberry-like. The aroma is flase and dominated by raspberries. Aroma gives me a headache. Transparent, mildly hazy blonde/yellow color with a small white head. Sweet raspberries to start turning quite tart with more raspberry notes. One-dimensional false raspberry juice. Not revolting, just boring gimmick ""fruit"" beer."
The Cambridge House Discovery Organic Pale Ale;Granby, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The Cambridge House;Tap at the brewery. They were also calling this DOPA. They should have called it CRAP. Slightly orange citrus hop aroma which is very mild and somewhat difficult to detect. A few sweet notes waft by. Wish this was a more aggressive aroma. Moderately hazy orange-straw color with a small off-white head. Citrus, and mild sweetness to start, turning grain and cereal-like in the middle. This is pretty bland and thin. Not much going on. Organophilic tree-hugging hippy granolas can have this beer. Instead I will shower and have the good stuff. A disappointing beer from a brewer who has loads more ability than this.
The Cambridge House Discovery Organic Pale Ale;Granby, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The Cambridge House;Growler Deep golden in color with a small white head. Mild fruit aroma and hops. Flavor is of clean malt charcater and toasty malt.
The Cambridge House Discovery Organic Pale Ale;Granby, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;The Cambridge House;Draught @ Brewpub: This is an interesting beer. At 4.4%ABV, it is a little less than the majority of their beers. It doesn’t seem to hurt it at all. The aroma is a tad light, but a pleasant mix of some malts (although no sweetness), and a slight hop spiciness. It is a slightly hazy, somewhat orangish color, with a small head and some lacing. The taste is a bit dry. It is somewhat biscuity, and has a good malt base, with no sweetness at all. The hops are evident, but no real bitterness to the beer. A very nice session beer.
The Tap Lucky 7;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Draught pint at Red Bones 7/23/06. Pours a thin watery light nut brown color with little to no head. Appearance is very flat and dull. Nose is light cherrys, some nuts and dark fruit. Palate is thin and watery, very little going on. Flavor is more of the cherrys an ddark fruit with some light caramel and chocolate malt notes.
The Tap Lucky 7;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Dubbel;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;On draught at Publick House 9/27/2005. Pours a dark brown with some light magenta-auburn tinges as it settles out. Lighter chestnut browns around the edges as well. Head is small, off-white to beige but fairly well-retained, with light lacing. After settling, it’s quite transluscent, bordering on clear. Looks like a porter. Aroma of cigars, bakers chocolate, light cherries and dates, light yeast and buttercream, and then an appearance of light coffee?? Flavor takes it a step further and gets roasty. Not toasted, not bitter chocolate, but roast. Coffee flavored and porter like. It clearly has a Belgianish yeast, though it’s rather light on that, with some light caramel and cocoa sugars. Body gets watery very quickly, could use a significant dose of carbonation, while the roast just takes over. Probably wouldnt finish this if it was in a bottle. Hints of vanilla, cream and almost oat-like in flavor. Very odd, don’t know if this was supposed to be a Belgian porter, whatever the hell that would be, but it clearly called itself an Abbey Style ale, so I’ve just got to assume that something went wrong in brewing, or in the heads of the brewers. Either way, it’s relatively uncomplex, with a medium body and too loose a consistency.
Lost Duck Pelican Porter;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Porter;Lost Duck Brewing Company;6 oz draft pours black with a tan head. Not much aroma and kind of funky taste. My least favorite. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Lost Duck Pelican Porter;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Porter;Lost Duck Brewing Company;A very rich beer but to much roasted taste for my liking. Could not taste the hint of cherry or raisins as I was told was in there. There are better Porters out there.
Lost Duck Pelican Porter;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Porter;Lost Duck Brewing Company;Pours a deep amber brown with a medium tight head. The aroma has some tomato and other vegetal notes with some light coffee, largely weird. The flavor has a light coffee flavor with some chocolate, some slight hops and some freaking tomato. No more tomatoes in the porter please.
Lost Duck Pelican Porter;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Porter;Lost Duck Brewing Company;From the tap, served for my personal taste, too cold and over carbonated, in a pint glass. Poured a dark cola brown with a small off-white head that settled into a fine lacing. Aromas of chocolate and root beer, a soft banana fruitiness, and traces of coffee. Fizzy carbonation and a malty crisp, a tad rough in the palate from the over carbonation, medium-light bodied mouthfeel. Drinkable, but bland tasting porter, even after I let warm up a bit, light coffee with milk, a little chocolate with the banana fruitiness, the root beer flavor again, and a softly malty bitter finish. Not one of my favorites at the Duck, pretty ordinary, but maybe I like porters too much to find this acceptable, one glass and I’m done.
Lost Duck Pelican Porter;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Porter;Lost Duck Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Opaque black color with disappearing thin off white head that left no lace. There was a whiff of anise but not much aroma otherwise. Tastes of milk chocolate and a touch of roasted malt. Slightly sweet on the tongue.
Lost Duck Pelican Porter;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Porter;Lost Duck Brewing Company;"Deep reddish brown, more old slightly burnt weak coffee than fresh espresso, maybe some nutmeg but I don’t get the chocolate I expect in a Porter. Little aroma. This is drinkable but I agree with Heemer--""thin,"" not much finish or complexity."
Lost Duck Pelican Porter;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Porter;Lost Duck Brewing Company;I tried this one again at the brewpub. It was about the same. Still thin and watery. Just bland more than anything. Sampled from a guest tap at the Old Capitol brewpub in Iowa City. Poured with a dark brown body and some ruby showing through. The aroma is interesting with fresh gingerbread. There is also some maple and hay. The taste has old tea with cola and some light roasted character. There are also some peanuts. Nothing bad here, just a little thin.
Old Capitol Terrapin Coffee Stout;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;draft. Black with a nice thick tan head. Dark malt and coffee in the aroma. Flavor was strong coffee, malty sweetness, and bittersweet chocolate. Finishes slightly bitter, light carbonation. Decent.
Old Capitol Terrapin Coffee Stout;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Draft pint at the brewery. Deep brown with a brown head, well formed and darkness than most stout appears. Has a weak nose of mostly roast and black malts, only minimal coffee presence until it warms, when it picks up but it’s not something I would describe as heavy or forward. It tastes a bit more of coffee than it smells, but it’s an oily effect, with a coffee resin (buttery) throughout the drink. Overall it’s a below average coffee stout made from a below average stout.
Old Capitol Terrapin Coffee Stout;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;From some undated notes, on tap at the brewpub. Black with ruby edges and a one finger brown head, fades to a thin film before long. Aroma of cold coffee, roasted malts, and some spent grain--not to the point of dry dog food though. Flavor has stronger coffee and bitter roasted malts, spen grain again, with some moderate bitterness. There is some sweet molasses and light acidity in there somewhere as well. I had a side note that maybe there was some lactose in there. A bit thin though it is somewhat creamy with low carbonation. Not bad, but I wouldn’t travel very far just to try this one.
Old Capitol Terrapin Coffee Stout;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;(Tap) Pours black with a small tan head. Tastes very similar to their Straight Pipe stout, but with some lactose and coffee added to it. The brew is nicely balanced, and is not too sweet (which is a plus). Decent palate and fine carbonation.
Old Capitol Terrapin Coffee Stout;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Draft. Moderate malt and coffee aroma. Dark brown color with good lacing and medium diminishing head. Flavor was a cross between ice coffee and stout with the coffee flavor very evident. Good balance between bitter and sweet. Easy to drink. Palate was on the watery side. Good overall.
Old Capitol Terrapin Coffee Stout;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Draft at brewpub. Dark brown color with an average frothy brown head that mostly diminished with fair lacing. Moderate coffee toasted malt aroma. Medium to full body with a creamy texture. Medium sweet coffee flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. This is the standout brew of the group I tasted.
Old Capitol Terrapin Coffee Stout;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Very black pour, small tan head that dies away. No lacing. Smells of roasted malt, bakers chocolate, and strong, black coffee. No messing around, the smells are all blended together and they hit you like a hammer. Tastes like a very strong, dark coffee upfront--roasted beans, wonderfully bitter--gives way to semi sweetness, dark chocolate and light mocha chocolate. Ends on a kick of bitter malt and vanilla. Kudos to OC, for another great beer.
Old Capitol Terrapin Coffee Stout;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;I drank this from a bottle. It has a rich and smooth taste with a creamy coffee feel to it. Very easy to drink stout and I would recommend it to anyone. I am not a big coffee drinker so I was suprised at how much I liked this.
Old Capitol Terrapin Coffee Stout;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;"Yum! Like drinking espresso with a few bubbles. On tap at brewpub. Rich black, full mouthfeel, creamy, just what their regular stout needs to jazz it up. But I may be biased as I""m a big coffee drinker."
Old Capitol Terrapin Coffee Stout;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Draught at the brewpub. Opaque black with bubbly brown head. The nose and flavor are coffee and chocolate. No sweetness. Kind of like a carbonated espresso. My only gripe is that it was a bit too carbonated. Would be nice to nitrogenate it.
King Festbier;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;King Brewing Company;First of all, I’m glad that the guy at the store warned me that it would explode in my face, because it definitely did. The foam just kept coming and coming coming and coming and it took about 20 minutes for the foam to settle down into an actual glass of beer. I thought it was annoying, yet my boy Ankur argued that it was all in good fun. Once settled, it poured into a brownish mess of a haze with a foamy white head. The head had dark brown flecks of yeast and perhaps some of the spices of the beer on it. The beer itself looked like apple cider, with chucks and flakes swashing around throughout. It smelled strong of malt and that’s it, however the tasting had much more to offer. It had a wintery spice and smooth finish of a delicious holiday ale. However, after the foaming fiasco, the brew is almost flat and could afford a little more carbonation once in the glass. The body is a solid medium, however sludgy it looks from the side. Overall it’s drinkable and interesting and I would have totally hated it except for its splendid flavor. From the few other ratings, it appears maybe the batch to Michigan had too much yeast or was shakin to hell for a week straight, who knows. At least I was warned beforehand and thus only suffered MINIMAL property damage...
King Festbier;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;King Brewing Company;Pours a hazy effervescent copper orange. An inch of creamy tan foam sticks around for a long while. Good webby lacing. Generic sweet aroma lacks character. Odd astringent flavor up front - medicinal and herbal and almost bleachy. I get little beyond this - maybe some dusty malt. Medium body, good carbonation, unpleasant sweet and dusty and medicinal aftertaste. The infrasructure (appearance and body and carbonation) is okay. The taste and aftertaste make it utterly avoidable.
King Festbier;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;King Brewing Company;I wonder if this one had some issues, might’ve been skunked so I guess I’ll take that into account. Bottle shared by sliffy...thanks...I think. Pours amber with a gigiantic foamy head to which the first thought in my mind is infection. The aroma pretty much smelled like sour malt and iodine. The flavor was some light malt, corn...kinda gritty with a skunky finish. I’m sure this is better when not skunked, but still all that fantastic.
King Festbier;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;King Brewing Company;Bottle picked up at random off a single shelf: Ruddy copper color with a monster off white head. Aroma was a little grassy, smelled a little skunked. Flavor, caramel, some other lighter malts. Not that great.
King Festbier;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;King Brewing Company;Looks like an amber, deep copper color. Not much aroma to speak of. Tastes like an autumn beer, not too malty. Nothing that makes it stand out, but nothing that makes it bad.
King Festbier;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;King Brewing Company;Deep amber with absolutely no head. Aroma is rather muted toasted malt and nothing else. Flavor is very astringent through and through. Very hard to pick up any individual flavors. Body is thin at times.
King Festbier;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;King Brewing Company;Bottle from Jim (walleye) Thanks! Straight from the bottle, too lazy to get a glass. Would imagine it is orange in color. Smells malty and fruity and a little sour. Taste is also kind of sour, not hoppy at all. Pleasant and not an overwhelming sense of bullshit that most Marzens carry with them. I enjoyed it, actually.
King Festbier;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;King Brewing Company;A nice copper amber color with a generous and sustained head of off-white foam. A little tart in the nose at first but there is also some nice Oktoberfest malt character (caramelly, toasty, and some nice marshmallow), almost perfect, except for that tart character. This was tasting amazing, until the tart character arose. It does not taste like an infection, but more like a water problem. I am almost sure they do not (or do a poor job) of removing the chlorine from their water. Just like what chlorine will do to coffee or lemonade (which is destroy the flavor by ’chlorinating’ it), it has done it to these beers. Recipe formulation seems to be excellent to me except for some overly aggressive bittering hop.
King Festbier;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;King Brewing Company;Cloudy dark amber with little head. Aroma is light and of caramel. The flavor is caramel and toffee. The mouthfeel is thin.
King Festbier;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;King Brewing Company;Bottle: Aroma is very sweet. Caramel, sugar, light spice, and flowery hops. Pours a mostly transparent reddish-orange with some haze. Big off-white head with pretty good retention. Can think of another beer that begins acidic, usually it comes in the finish. Not this beer. This starts off with a strong acidity. Once it fades, lots of caramel and light brown sugar. Slight flowery hops in the finish. Decent beer, but the strong initial acidity is a bit of a turnoff.
Milestone Shine On;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milestone Brewery;On tap at the Three Horseshoes, Waddington. Golden colour with a white head. Not a great golden beer. A touch thin not much hop.
Milestone Shine On;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milestone Brewery;Pint at the Turf Tavern in Oxford. This looked good, but tastes very average. Drinkable certainly, worth having again? Not really.
Milestone Shine On;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milestone Brewery;Cask gravity at Firkin Ale House Folkestone, clear gold no head. Some pale malt not much hop rather dull golden ale.
Milestone Shine On;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milestone Brewery;Very honeyed beer and very sweet as a result pint at the healey rochdale. Ok but not outstanding in any way.
Milestone Shine On;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milestone Brewery;On cask at the Pheasant in Wellington. Appearance - golden with a proportionate head and a slight haze. Nose - meadow flowers, maybe some apple. Taste - stewed apples and light citrus. Palate - light bodied with a creamy texture and a long dry finish. Overall - a decent ale.
Milestone Shine On;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milestone Brewery;Cask @ Old Gate, Hebden Bridge. Pale gold with a thin creamy head. Has a bread malt aroma with a light citrus fruit taste and a small kick. Session material.
Milestone Shine On;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milestone Brewery;Cask at the 7 Stars, Rugby, 12/03/14. Clear pale golden blonde with a good sized white head - the best aspect of this one! Nose is pale malt, straw, light lemon zest, grainy, corn. Taste comprises light citrus, grass, bread dough, pale malt, cereal. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, drying close. Medicority in a glass, bland and dull, akin to a pale lager!
Milestone Shine On;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milestone Brewery;Cask @ Hop & Vine, Hull. Yellow gold. Clear with a decent showing of a white head. Very faint aroma. A bit of lemon, spruce, soap. Taste is ok, nothing out of the ordinary. Sweet at first rounding to a bitter finish with a hint of sour. As boring pale beers go, this is at least clean and refreshing.
Milestone Shine On;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milestone Brewery;Cask handpull, The Crown, Nuneaton, 17/11/12. Clean straw with a skim of white. Lime and flowers nose. Thin and limey with an almond and corn background. Cream and vanilla afters. Alright.
Milestone Shine On;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milestone Brewery;Cask-conditioned at the Nottinghamshire beer festival, Seven Stars, Bristol March 2012. Golden in colour with a slight white head. Light aroma of fruit with some grassy hops. Flavour of creamy malts with a sharp finish. Not so pleasant.
Belvoir Long Shot;Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Belvoir Brewery;Cask Conditioned at Far from the Madding Crowd, Oxford. Perfect amber, crystal clear with white bubbly head. Wow, bless my soul and take me to heaven, this is a beautiful dry and vastly hoppy bitter. Nice dark malts complement a grassy, peachy with apple notes beer and theres more, I also wrote Elderflower and Gooseberry. It was in top notch condition and after the day I had had it was perfect. At times like this I look for inspiration from music, so what was on the MP3? Perfect 10 by Beautiful South, I couldn’t have summed it up better.
Domein;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;This beer is served at scouting caampingplaces in Belgium and has two apperances with golden cap and blue cap. Golden is the blond variaty and blue the dubbel. The beer is probably just a label beer from this brewery. Both the beer are very pleasant but nothing special really. I just think they addes caramels to the darker one to get a different taste and color.

Portsmouth Kate The Great Russian Imperial Stout;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Imperial;Portsmouth Brewery;2012 version (stubby bottles) - tasted after the Red Sox won the 2018 World Series. Head - dark brown Still boozy with raisins and plums.
Portsmouth Kate The Great Russian Imperial Stout;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Imperial;Portsmouth Brewery;0.65l bottle from 2010 shared with The Tasting Crew. This one pours a deep dark brown body with a small quite bubbly off-white head. It has this lovely roasted and almost on the verge of burned-roasted aroma with a, for the first time for me, fantastic nice roasted cardboard thing. I also get both sweet and salty licorice in this one. Flavor: both salty with a tone of acidity. There's soy sauce and a strong roasty dryness. I'm surprised that it's so acidic. Coffee acidic perhaps? Almost a coffee machine this. Fantastic! 27.07.2012
Portsmouth Kate The Great Russian Imperial Stout;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Imperial;Portsmouth Brewery;Sampled at gregwilsonstl's house. It poured a black color with a tan head. The aroma was of roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla and coffee. The taste was similar to the aroma with more roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, coffee with medium carbonation and a nice aftertaste. Not bad for a 2009 vintage. Nice.
Portsmouth Kate The Great Russian Imperial Stout;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Imperial;Portsmouth Brewery;It pours dark brown with an off white head. The aroma has soy sauce, heavy roast and dark roast.. It has medium body with mild carbonation. The taste is soured, funky and of..... But it's 2009. Sure better fresh and such, but won't have that opportunity
Portsmouth Kate The Great Russian Imperial Stout;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Imperial;Portsmouth Brewery;Sampled at Gregwilsonstl’s tasting. Almost black with just a little tan foam. Glad to get a shot at this. ‘09 version. Dark malts with raspberries. Earth and tobacco. Chocolate under that. A lot going on and I am not sure all of it is intended. Still, it has held up well.
Portsmouth Kate The Great Russian Imperial Stout;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Imperial;Portsmouth Brewery;Oxidized. Dark black. Good but not great. This was probably amazing in 2009. Tasted at my Plants and Animals Bottle share.
Portsmouth Kate The Great Russian Imperial Stout;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Imperial;Portsmouth Brewery;Bottle split at RB Best Encomium share, Santa Rosa, 30/01/16 - Big Thanks to Moe Juck aka Wald Bizzard for hooking me up with this juant! 2009 vintage. Pitch black with a well presented tan head. Nose is rich dark malts, light soy xauce, tangy dark fruits, chocolate dipped raisins. Taste comprises red berry notes, chocolate, burnt toffee, roast malts, molasses, black forest gateaux, raspberry tang, earthy. Full bodied, fine carbonation, light warming boost in the close. Solid well rounded impy but a touch past its best now I imagine.
Portsmouth Kate The Great Russian Imperial Stout;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Imperial;Portsmouth Brewery;Bottle shared at Ratebeer awards show. 30/01/2016. Huge thanks! 2009 bottle. A clear depp black / brown coloured pour with reddy hues and a reluctant tan head. Aroma is dark chocolate malts, rih, jammy fruits, strawberry. Flavour is composed of brown sugars, dark choc, fruits esters, strawberry, tangy raspberry. Palate is full sticky sweet, full bodies, moderate carbonation. .. Very well balanced and drinkable for such a big beer.
Portsmouth Kate The Great Russian Imperial Stout;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Imperial;Portsmouth Brewery;2010 bottle thanks to Toby. Pours out a black topped with a small tan head. Nose is rich roast malts cocoa some plum and coffee. Taste is more of the heavy roast malts chocolate cocoa some vanilla and that coffee. We did this with kabert and black Albert aswell all 3.
Portsmouth Kate The Great Russian Imperial Stout;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Imperial;Portsmouth Brewery;Thanks to my cousin. We’ve been wanting to try this for a while - it has been in the cellar for 6 years. Lots if grain/bread in the flavor. A little sharp and spicy, with amber-like notes and molasses. Impressive but overrated sorry to say (I think this was the #1 brew at Beer Advocate for a while, but we know how good their ratings are, don’t we?).
Coopers Cave IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Coopers Cave Ale Company;"Well, might as well do this, tickers gotta tick, right? Here we go, this oughta be fun. Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a soft bronze color with a slight transparency about it. Fast rising carbonation claims the head as that dissipates without ever thinking it existed. The aroma was sharp metallic notes of dirt with a leafy burnt toast-like crisp drying sweetness. The flavor had the metallic notes again pummeling any sort of tastebuds that wanted to really try this beer to it’s full extent. The aftertaste and finish I do not wish to say on ratebeer as it wouldn’t do any justice. The feel was rustiness grinding into my tongue like a bat out of hell screaming at it saying ""Adam, your tongue will be my slave!"" Overall, well, Cooper’s, you should probably stay in your cave to brew beers that taste, smell and feel like this. My last Cooper’s beer I’ll ever try even if it was free."
Coopers Cave IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Orange-yellow, small white head. Minimal aroma of some malt. Thin body. Flavor is kind of bland. Some malt, barely detectable hops. It’s not offensive but does not really resemble any kind of IPA.
Coopers Cave IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Draft at the brewery, 7/6/15 Pane color with a creamy off white head. Slightly earthy hop with some spice and grassy notes. Feels a hint off in a way I can’t place. Soft carbonation, creamy mouthfeel.
Coopers Cave IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Just tried a bomber....I won’t go into the details but it circled the drain quite nicely. Undrinkable....so out of balance it was not even close to type. Glad the troops in India did not have to wait for this.
Coopers Cave IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Hmm. A mild, thin IPA. The hazy orange pour and the grassy floral aroma trickced me into thinking this would have more kick. The taste was mild hop, ornage peel and caramel malts. It was decent brew , but a little thin for my taste. I like my IPA’s bold and with charecter.
Coopers Cave IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Sampled from the tap at the brewpub. Poured a hazy orange with a near white head that dissipated to the edges and laced nicely. Aroma was full of citrus with some light flora, sweet grains and an odd green apple note. Same green apple note was present with the citrus and sweet grains and it threw the beer off...
Coopers Cave IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Not a great IPA I have had much better the hops were not as intense as I would have liked to have and it didn’t have much definition an average offering
Coopers Cave IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Growler. Pours copper with a thin white head. Smells of citrus, resiny, grassy, caramel. Tastes bitter and resiny with a grassy finish. Decent.
Coopers Cave IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Coopers Cave Ale Company;on tap-pours an offwhite head with hazy copper-amber color. Aroma is hops-fruity, floral. Taste is a somewhat biting/tangy hops, secondary caramel malt. Finish is bitter hops.
Coopers Cave IPA;Glens Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Coopers Cave Ale Company;Bottle (purchased at brewery). Musty aroma with a weird fruitiness. Floral and basement mold-like aroma. Mildly hazy copper-amber color with a frothy off-white head. Weird musty, perfumey start and underlying flavor throughout. Finishes nice and roasty and toasted with malts. Some bitter hops are also present in the end. The funky musty flavor really kills this beer. Tastes like a combination of wet-dog and dirty stagnant dishwater. Drain pour. **Side Note* My sink still has this aroma the next morning despite rinsing it down the sink with copious amounts of water the night before. Thank god for Lestoil.

Fyfe Fyre;Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Fyfe Brewing Co.;Tasted this in the Golden Acorn, Glenrothes (JDW) in August 2007. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear sparkling gold in colour with a thin white head. Strong pale malt present in the long aroma. Good creamy mouthfeel with a thin syrupy texture and excellent lacing. Pale malt base gives a digestive biscuit base with sweet golden syrup notes. Dusty hop resins give a dry citrusy tang to the long aftertaste. Finish is again zesty with lemon & lime notes to the fore along with biscuity malt. A decent ESB and the strongest ale in the Fyfe portfolio - but why stick with the pale types - come on Fyfe, give us a dark barley wine to even things up!

Geur ruikt als een goed oude gerookte shandy (bier/wijn) Echt knap gebrouwen, ondanks dat het limited is is het gewoon op de tap verkrijgbaar. Zwart met nauwelijks schuim. Zach smooth lekker
Flying Dog Gonzo Imperial Porter - Barrel Aged;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Porter - Imperial;Flying Dog Brewery;On tap at the beer temple. Wow that's a lot of whisky! Pours almost black with a fine sheet of white head. Aroma is dominated by whisky, met by dark malts, a lot of chocolate. Big body. Flavour is sweet and spicy, lot of complexity here. Different malt aspects, foremost chocolate and maybe some coffee, but also burnt caramel and molasses. Medium bitterness, with the hops imparting some herbal qualities. Quite hoppy actually. And of course a lot of whisky, especially in the finish. What a lovely porter. The whisky is dominating, but doesn't take over. Super.

Zero Gravity Dwaynes Dunkel;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;On tap in Burlington. A thin-looking dark ruby brown brew. Little to no head. Light malty aroma and flavors. Thin bodied. Not very exciting. The brown ale was better.

Shed Strongman Porter;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Porter - Imperial;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Dark brown, almost black. Coffee, roasted malt and a mild bitter chocolate flavor dominate. Alcohol is definitely present and can be tasted just prior to the roasted, malty finish. Haven’t been impressed w/ The Shed in the past, but this beer was head and shoulders above some of their previous attempts. Hopefully this new brewer can turn things around!

Speckled spotty beige lacing left on the glass. Smell is of creamy dark malts. Pretty nice as far as Imperial Porters go. Dark malts of the German varieties. Not bad at all. English yeast utilized.

A fine Imperial Porter with a mild bit of smokiness coming through.

Fine-bubbled, lasting creamy light tan head topping a dense, absolutely pitch-black body, great thick lacing...excellently balanced licorice-dark chocolate-vinous nose...moderately sweet initial mouthfeel, anise and root-beer character upfront, herbal spiciness continues as Mexican chocolate makes an entry and a bit of light mocha frothiness completes the interesting tongue experience....nicely bitter with dry coffee grounds at the finish...easily the best beer yet from the great new brewer at this transformed brewpub.

Pinkish white head that fades down to a thin layer on the surface and some spots of foam on the glass. Mmm. Very tart. Cherry. It’s got a good edge on it. Bright. Light.

Andechser Jubiläumsbier Dunkel Naturtrüb;Andechs, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Klosterbrauerei Andechs;Tap at the source, as Winterbier. Noticeably hazy brown color with frothy beige head. Aroma is chocolate, earthy, hazelnuts. Taste is chocolate, a touch molasses, very bready, not too sweet, some herbal flavours as well. Smooth mouthfeel with bready flavours and a touch of yeastcake in the aftertaste. This is basically a more sessionable Zwickel-version of their Doppelbock. It's delicate, but also a bit too light for the 5.9% maybe... still very good!

Andechser Jubiläumsbier Dunkel Naturtrüb;Andechs, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Klosterbrauerei Andechs;Draught at Kloster Andechs. Head is mostly lasting. Body is dark brown. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted bread, roasted grain, coffee, chocolate, caramel). Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Took quite a while for the aroma to really show itself, but it’s fairly nice. A bit sour and stark and thin in the mouth. Ultimately just mediocre. Still better than their Doppelbock, though, which has turned into something really disappointing.
Andechser Jubiläumsbier Dunkel Naturtrüb;Andechs, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Klosterbrauerei Andechs;Draught @ kloster: Rich garnet. Beefy and complex malt aromatics of blackened malt hulls, coffee, roasted nuts and burnt toffee. Fairly candyish with hints of plum, molasses, and an odd whiff of sawdust. Foamy residue of carbonation coats the palate. Somewhat off-putting, initially, with an unripe plum tartness which is soon enveloped by a blanket of soft malt. Bouncy notes of fresh plum elicit Special B notions, while remarkably deep and flavorsome coffee and smoky-roast flourish beneath. Malt continues to unfold with a roasted-nut and charcoal snappiness which marries with burnt toffee and an earthy edge of coffee. The grains, although cleanly extracted, fall short in length due to the foamy carbonation and creeping unripe-fruit acid which disperse their fullness. Ironlike/metallic twang creeps in as well, along with an unwelcome note of sweet cola which tarnishes the otherwise lustrous malt. Closes with fresh hay and ample well-textured toasty heft amid a a smoky dryness which cradles the luscious chocolate character. This is bit of a mixed bag. The malt shows tremendous promise at times, though the odd sourness (same as found in the doppelbock, though it’s more subdued here) is very difficult to overlook. The foamy mouthfeel also needs much work. Good potential here, but as is, not something I wanted to drink much of.
Bosch Radler Hell;Bad Laasphe, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Brauerei Bosch;Fris zoet op wat limoen weinig smaak.

Taylor Poseidon Pale Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Taylor Brewing Company;(draught at brewpub) medium gold with almost no head but some lace. Very little aroma. Flavor is must/grassy with a sour finish. The brewpub has a lot of taps - perhaps the beers sit too long?
Taylor Poseidon Pale Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Taylor Brewing Company;Draft. First impression is that it’s going for the fruitiness of an SNPA. It succeeds there partly. A light, iced-tea body under an insubstantial head. Bubble gum and sweet cherry taste from a warm ferment Also a bit sour, though. Pineapple and grassy hops are in evidence, with, me thinks, a touch of Noble in the finish. It’s pretty fair, and brewed on premise.
Taylor Poseidon Pale Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Taylor Brewing Company;Golden without much of a head, this had an odd toffee and nut aroma with a drop of orange zest.

Wear Valley Old Vinovium;Bishop Auckland, Durham, England;Stout;Wear Valley Brewery;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Dark black, with a bubbly beige head. A thin, fruity mouthfeel, reminiscent of blackcurrant cordial or fruit pastilles. A tip of the hat to roast on the finish, but otherwise no dryness. Not sure about the style here: I think it’s a sweet Porter, but equally it could be a fruity Mild, or a very dark ESB. Hopefully someone else will try it and have an opinion. OK
Alt-Marburger Schwarzbier;Marburg, Hesse, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Marburger Spezialitätenbrauerei Klaus Rauh;(Bottle 50 cl) Pretty light brown beer with a rather small head.

Emmetts Barley Wine;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Taster, on tap at Downers Grove. This smells like a fresher barley wine, what with its citrusy hop smell. A thinning layer of foam. Hops are more bitter than anything else, I’m guessing Northern Brewers at the top of the bill. Light texture lets more malt character out, too. A nice, though brusque taste.

Flavor is even more burnt and caramel than aroma. Lots of toffee and sweet spiced cake, The hops really come out in the finish with a strong resin notes that fit nicely. Medium to full body and a soft carbonation. A pretty tasty barley wine.
Emmetts Barley Wine;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Draught at the pub in Palatine under the name American Barleywine. Has a rich piney aroma with some malty fruity notes. Richly flavored with a potent sweet malty presence and a floral piney hops that balances but is not overpowering in either dimension. Nice big barleywine that delivers a lot of flavor and punch with surprising balance.
Emmetts Barley Wine;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On tap at Palatine location. Served in snifter. Pours hazy brown with small light tan head. Aromas of caramel, malts, toffee, some hops. Flavors of malts, caramel, toffee, and some hop bitterness. Really malty BW that is lacking complex flavors you come to expect from a good barley wine. Alcohol is well hidden. Not to bad overall.
Emmetts Barley Wine;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Emmetts Brewing Co.;as the description claims, this was a big barleywine, but huge on the malt and without a real distinctive hop character for me. i got the nice bitterness in the finish, but not the spicy and floweryness aluded to in the description. the body was huge and sticky with the faintest hint of alcohol, but very faint mind you. very roasty with coffee character coming through. I had a snifter of this at the downers grove location.
Emmetts Barley Wine;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Served in a snifter from the palatine location. Dark dark with a thin quickly discipating tan greyish head. As the light passes through it the dark is more of a fine dark ruby that is crystal clear, no sediment. The nose is faintly present at a distance with malts that are roasted. Initially the first bite is hippy but quickly fades into plums or even black fruit snacks or something then into malts that is mostly toasted and roasted malts that is more bitter towards the end. What is interesting about this bitter is that it has the feel or the presence of bitter mostly found in coffee kind of bitter but I dont really get any coffee from this. I bet that the bitter is from the hops without that hop kick found in some of their other beers. Another thing, it says that this is 10% alcohol but this beer is quite deceptive. Alcohol is not really present but I could feel it when I got up (not eating anything all day probably didnt hurt).
Third Street Aleworks Cerveza de Santa Rosa Chile Ale;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Third Street Aleworks;Waaaaaay better than you think. Has a nice but not too strong burn at the finish, flavor exceeds expectations. Superior accompaniment to spicy food.
Third Street Aleworks Cerveza de Santa Rosa Chile Ale;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Third Street Aleworks;On tap at Aleworks. Pretty good overall. Some hoppy flavour, but not much, but a good bit of mild spicyiness makes it much more interesting. Not really my type of beer, but good.
Third Street Aleworks Cerveza de Santa Rosa Chile Ale;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Third Street Aleworks;On tap at Aleworks. Golden yellow color with some hops in the nose and a slightly spicy smell. It tastes like a good version of Corona with a slight chili flavor that really gets more noticable at the finish. Leaves a nice burn. Good stuff, I’d drink it aagin.
Third Street Aleworks Cerveza de Santa Rosa Chile Ale;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Third Street Aleworks;GABF. Name verified on website under specialtiy beers. Pours a golden yellow. Aroma is a nice, low-key chili. Flavor is a subtle chili that doesn’t overpower. Palate is nice and suitable. Good chili bite in the finish.
Black Diamond Wild Rice;Concord, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Black Diamond Brewing Company;"""mild is definitely the key word here...and as such, it kinda works as a session ale, but nothing i’d buy again. like a bud without the skunky bitterness."""
Black Diamond Wild Rice;Concord, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Black Diamond Brewing Company;Finally got another shot at this one after enjoying a small swig at the GABF last year. Hazy straw colour. Complex aroma with wild rice, spices and florals. A little on the fizzy side, which obscures some of the subtlety, but great complex spice and wild rice flavours. Nutty, wonderful, distinctive brew. I’d like to see more wild rice beers, quite frankly.
Black Diamond Wild Rice;Concord, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Black Diamond Brewing Company;Bottled. Pale yellow with lively brief head. Estery blueberry aroma. Dryish and tart with extremely lively mouthfeel. Bursting with berryish flavour, yet subtle. No bitterness. A beer that certainly stands out.
Black Diamond Wild Rice;Concord, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Black Diamond Brewing Company;This ale pours a slightly hazy gold color from a hand bottled bomber. Small to medium sized head. Aroma is sweet and kind of honeyish. A medium to light bodied ale. Malts are fruity and sweet. Light and refreshing, Kind of sweet and kind of meadish tasting. Actually I can’t really describe it, as it’s really not anything I’ve had before. It’s very mild but has a lot of flavor. Nice beer, I hope to see more of this one soon. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Black Diamond Wild Rice;Concord, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Black Diamond Brewing Company;"Cask. At the Triple Rock Firkin Fest. Clear gold color. The aroma is all wild rice. The flavor is ...wild rice. I see this is classified as an Abbey Dubbel- That’s probaly a mistake- It’s not even close. Still, I can’t get beyond the fact that this is a very well done beer; it’s just not anything I’ve ever had before and quite honestly, I don’t know what to think of it. I love beer; I love wild rice; but a wild rice beer... I don’t know. Kudos to Black Diamond for doing something so different though!"
Black Diamond Wild Rice;Concord, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Black Diamond Brewing Company;GABF. Had to try a brew from this brewer ’cause the name is one of my favorite KISS songs. Anyways, this is one strange beer. It pours gold, smells sweet and sugary, but it TASTES LIKE SUASAGE. Yes, IT TASTES LIKE SAUSAGE. Since I love sausage, I gave the flavor a 5. Watery palate. What exaclty is the aim for this one???
Basil Ts Oktoberfest Beer;Toms River, New Jersey, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Artisan's Brewery and Italian Grill;Draft. Once again a decent looking beer, deep mahogany orange body with just the slightest touch of foamy off white head. Aroma is very weak, slight malts not much else. Body is light and the flavor is malt dominant with only the slightest hint of spice. Highly drinkable none the less though.

Dix Vienna Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Dix BBQ & Brewery;Bready malts are chewy with herbal, grassy hops apparent in the somewhat low, but pleasant aroma. Clear, deep, golden coloured body is topped by a decent and lasting cover of fine bubbled white head that leaves some lacing. Bready malt flavour with some mild fruity esters, lightly spicy, herbal, grassy hops and assertive balancing bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Medium light body with crisp carbonation. Sampled on tap at the brewpub with Oakes before Grey Cup 2005.
Dix Vienna Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Dix BBQ & Brewery;Clear amber colour with thick lasting white head. Slightly antiseptic nose. Mild malt taste with slight hop finish.

Dix Vienna Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Dix BBQ & Brewery;Bright copper colour with a finger of foam. Firm, fresh malty-toasty aroma. Very clean, with a complex and even-handed malt character. Seems pretty close to the textbook, a good thing for a Vienna.
Dix Vienna Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Dix BBQ & Brewery;Clear amber beer, with a thick, fluffy off-white head. Clean malty aroma, a touch of orange. Flavour is of light caramel malt and a decent spicy hop flavour as well. A bit of citrus on the finish. Some dustiness that isn’t appropriate, but it’s still a fairly drinkable beer.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Low Country Pale Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Carolina Beer Company;This particular beer wasn’t my first idea for a milestone, but I’m on vacation in NC and it’ll have to do. Also, it’s a beer from NC, so I guess that makes it a little better. But the beer itself isn’t all that great. It pours a clear golden color with a decent white head. The head leaves a good amount of lacing around the glass, as well. The nose isn’t very inviting, with a little bit of a sour note, along with some flowery hops and bread. The flavors are little tart, sour and not very pleasing. The finish is best part of the pale ale, with some nice bitter hops and bready flavors. But unfortunately, the rest of the beer is pretty substandard. Nonetheless, it’s #1500.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Low Country Pale Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Carolina Beer Company;Tap at Woods on South 2/1/08: Pours a transparent deep golden with a thin, clingy-lacing froth of white head. Has a fresh piny resiny hop nose and a light malty backbone. Starts effervescent and semi-sweet balanced with an earthy piny hop flavor before a blander grainy dry finish A decent APA but could use a little more body and sweetness.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Low Country Pale Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Carolina Beer Company;Tap/ Pale in color with a nice sweet aroma. Hops don’t blow you away as in some American Pales. Not a bad beer but nothing to get excited about.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Low Country Pale Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Carolina Beer Company;Bottle at the charlotte airport. Looks like pale lager. Fairly refreshing aroma. Good tingly carbonation, as with most all carolina beers I’ve tasted. Hoppy but not too hoppy. Acceptable bitterness for a lager lover. Leaves a mild bitterness on the back of the throat. More acceptable to me compared to most other APA, its lower on the hop bitterness scale.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Low Country Pale Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Carolina Beer Company;Pours a clear pale yellow with foamy white head. Aroma floral hops. Flavor very overly carbonated. Plain dry corny taste with some flaovr dry hop finish. Overall, not too hot.

Smell is malt and dough. Burnt toast and yeast flavor. Super bubbly palate with high carbonation. Way too carbonated for me. It just tastes like soda water.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Low Country Pale Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Carolina Beer Company;Bottle courtesy of emacgee. Thanks man! Pours clear yellowish with a small whitish head. Smell is grainy, cereal like sweetness with the faintest bit of hops. Taste is somewhat muted with sweetend cereal like flavor going on initially followed by dull, bittering hops. Some slight hop flavor, but more as a balancing act rather than as the star. Moderate body with slightly high, prickly, refreshing carbonation. Not offensive, but not really bursting with flavor either. High drinkability with no off flavors, raises the score a bit for me.
Carolina Beer Co. Cottonwood Low Country Pale Ale;Mooresville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Carolina Beer Company;Pours from 12 oz bottle small off-white head atop a lightly hazed amber body. Aroma is medium sweet, floral, caramel, cereal. The flavour is medium sweet, caramel, some pine/floral resins and herbs. Very drinkable light-medium body with light acidity.

Ushers Best (Can);Devizes, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wadworth;Light amber body with a compact white head. Light grainy malt aroma. Watery thin taste, lightly bitter, resiny hops. Drinkable but nothing flash.
Ushers Best (Can);Devizes, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wadworth;Can. On the train coming home from Cardiff. Result of a rating. Deep amber colour with a creamy, giving beige head. I thought it was really trying, this little beer from the west. Indifferent aroma and only just bitter taste. Good smooth mouth feel. Alright under the trying circumstances.
Ushers Best (Can);Devizes, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wadworth;Can. And it tastes of can. Poor quality stewed hops. Kegged beers and canned beers are the pits of the Earth. Suck it and see. [1.2] Re-rate. Properly warmed this is delicately fruity and not unpleasant. Let a touch of cold get to the can before it's served and the whole thing turns really nasty.
Ushers Best (Can);Devizes, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wadworth;Had a can of this on the train from London to Torquay. Amber color, fine bubble head. Mettalic aroma, most likely from the can. Taste more like a brown ale than a bitter. If this is Ushers Best, I would hate to try their Worst.
Full Sail Lupulin Fresh Hop;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Flat amber with a creamy head. Very grassy, a little apple. Some light honeyed malts. Very bitter in the mouth with mega smooth cereals. Super smooth dry bitterness and a nettle hop flavour.
Full Sail Lupulin Fresh Hop;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Tap at Horsebrass Pub - clear light copper - soapy head - taste of moderately snappy, crisp malts - moderate acidity - strong, floral hoppiness - moderately spicy - finish is a little bready, which I was not expecting, considering the dry approach.
Full Sail Lupulin Fresh Hop;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Draft during Deschutes Fresh Hop Fest, Falling Rock, Denver. Slightly hazy gold, big rocky white head. Spicy hop aroma with some earthy dry malt tone. Taste was interesting indeed. Had some herbal spicy hop bitterness, with a subdued malt sweetness. A little on the funky bitter side with weak pale malt backing it up. Almost tasted Belgian. Not sure how to describe it.

Full Sail Lupulin Fresh Hop;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Draft, 2010: Flavorful stuff. Had a rich “greenness” to it. Grassy. Quite flavorful. Citric bite in the finish, along with an orange peel aroma. Subtle caramel and cocoa sweetness. Snappy and aromatic. One of the better fresh hop ales I’ve had this season.
Full Sail Lupulin Fresh Hop;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;On tap at Toronado. Pours dark golden with a thin off-white head and a toffee and wine aroma. There is a piny caramel malt flavor with serious hop bitterness. Very tasty.

Full Sail Lupulin Fresh Hop;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;"On Tap at the Falcon Tavern, downtown Boise. Slightly hazy light orange/amber with a full creamy light tan head that faded fairly quickly to a skin 1 microscopic bobble deep. Light malt aroma with some fruity hops. Citrus and melons. Slightly caramel malt flavor and a big hop flavor. Slightly metallic pithy bitterness. Not familiar with BG hops and the good thing about a single hop beer is that you can learn what that variety tastes like. I must say, I am still a fan of the ""C""s. This one is nice though."
Full Sail Lupulin Fresh Hop;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Clear gold pour with a short white head leaving a coarse lace. Toasty, hoppy nose and start with a meaty body overlaid with astringent, spruce hops. Long, bitter and sweet finish. Very sessionable.

Roots Organic Toasted Coconut Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Roots Organic Brewing;Draft at International Beer Garten (Lutz, FL). Pours a rich looking dark brown color with a dense tan foamed head. The aroma is fairly mild with subtle roasted malt and little else. The flavor is on the mild side as well, roasted malt, chocolate, some vanilla, and a touch of bourbon oak, but no coconut that I can decipher. Decent enough, but not very exciting.
Roots Organic Toasted Coconut Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Roots Organic Brewing;"On tap at Henry’s. Pours hazy brown with a thin white head. Has a mild cocoa aroma but not coconut to the aroma. Low carbonation. The flavor is tart but no dominant porter overtones at all. There’s absolutely no coconut in the taste profile. The beer is a bit disappointment. Again, organic seems to be synonymous with ""sucks."""
Roots Organic Toasted Coconut Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Roots Organic Brewing;Mild chocolatey porter with some creamy, bitter and roasty characteristics. The coconut is very light, almost adds more mouthfeel, and has a slightly lactic and nutty-toasty character.
Roots Organic Toasted Coconut Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Roots Organic Brewing;Dark brown pour with little to no head. The aroma is a touch roasty with some sweetness and a touch of toasted coconut. Coffee too. Roasted malt flavors, some sweet-ish dark malts. A light coconut presence. Really nice sweet/roasty finish.
Roots Organic Toasted Coconut Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Roots Organic Brewing;Draft. A dark brown beer with a red shine. The flavor is sweet with notes of coffee and coconuts. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of chocolate and roasted malt, as well as lighter notes of coconuts, leading to a dry roasted finish.
Roots Organic Toasted Coconut Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Roots Organic Brewing;On tap at Roots and at Bailey’s Taproom in PDX--Poured an opaque black-brown with a thick off-white head. Nose of tasted malts and slight hint of coconut. Flavor is sweet and robust-almost more a stout. NOt heavily carbonated but decent. I appreciated the inventiveness of this brewer.
Roots Organic Toasted Coconut Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Roots Organic Brewing;Very dark, almost stout like. Rich dense head. Slight aroma of coconut/toasted grains on nose, pleasant note. The taste is of dark fruit, chocolate and mocha. Somewhat sweet and cloying in the finish. Seems a bit low on carbonation. An interesting offering that happens to be organic.
Roots Organic Toasted Coconut Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Roots Organic Brewing;Draft at Roots: Pours a dark brown but definitely lots of brown highlights with not even a full head. Not off to a good start for me. But then the aroma changes my mind with some carmel malts, lots of chocolate and some toasted coconut. Flavor is light maltyness and a nice semi butter and sweet chocolateyness and a nice toasted coconut flavor. The coconut is nicely subdued which i enjoy since i am not a coconut fan but it really works here. There is a slight bitterness from the hops at the finish where this ends crisply. A really nicely balanced tasty and easy drinker.
Roots Organic Toasted Coconut Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Roots Organic Brewing;Their fall seasonal. Pours a very dark mahogany, close to black, with a light brown head. The coconut wasn’t as strong as I thought it would be, but I guess it’s really not that strong of a flavor normally. What it adds to this beer is really nice though. This porter is kept sweeter in the finish and trails out to a nice roasty chocolate aftertaste with a light cooling hint of coconut that adds a subtle sweetness that leaves you waiting for the next sip. Very smooth on the palate and goes down so easy for a sweet roasty porter. Very well made beer.
Roots Organic Toasted Coconut Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;Roots Organic Brewing;On tap at Roots, Portland. Deep ruby colour with lasting beige head. Really not keen on this. Moderate coconut. Malts are like a porter, are coffee and some choc. Could work, but doesn’t quite. Coconut milk is too strong. Quite lactic. I can see people liking it, but I don’t like coconut milk.
Brau Brothers Pale Ale;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;Picked this beer up in St. Paul. Not very good. Watery with a stale earthy aftertaste.
Brau Brothers Pale Ale;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;Bottle. I wonder how old this bottle is - holy crap, this is undrinkably awful. Horrible stale graham cracker nose, taste is dirty, chalky....omg, this is terrible. And while I ALSO like some more complexity, this beer really isn’t pretty decent. It sucks. Ooof - here’s hoping that this is in part due to the bottle - hopefully - being lost at the back of the liquor store for too long and that they didn’t actually bottle something that tasted like this.
Brau Brothers Pale Ale;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;The aroma of this pale ale has some hints of hops, and also of more malt than usual in a pale ale. The taste is similar to a blend between a pale ale and a less hoppy beer. So... it’s interesting, and I like the flavor of this beer. That said, it’s not typical of pale ales.
Brau Brothers Pale Ale;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;Nothing too special about this, which is probably why it is no longer brewed!
Brau Brothers Pale Ale;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;Deep polished bronze brew with a fluffy off white foam head. The nose has a little bit of pine and orange peels. The taste is like wood that has been rubbed with some orange peels. This finishes like club soda. Strange. The nose was somewhat promising, but the taste was bland and a let down.
Brau Brothers Pale Ale;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;Well, look at that, it’s a pale ale that’s pale.... they all seem so orange now a days. The head is small but tight and the lacing is fine enough. Aroma is sawdust, raw malt, light vegetable, and lighter floral hops. The flavor is clean and fruity with a distinct character of raw malted barley (save the sweetness), there is a nice toasty malt character and just a hint of toffee. There is some hop flavor here, mostly the fruity kind, but it’s really pretty muted, that isn’t to say that they didn’t use many hops here, but those all seemed to be employed as a bittering charge as opposed to lending much of a hop aroma or specific flavor the the beer. This is a pretty damned original take on the American style pale ale, not one that I’m particularly enthusiastic about, but this is a lot cleaner than their beers usually are. It’s not terrible.
Brau Brothers Pale Ale;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;Out of place flavor in this, fruity but not lemon or citrus, interesting APA although not among the best because the only real sign that its an APA is the slight dry kick to it.
Brau Brothers Pale Ale;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;Bottle. Clear golden amber pour with a white soapy head that fades to film on top. Aroma is soft malt and spice with a herbal tea scent. Taste is more malt herbal spice with a soft hop note. Palate is medium and watery with a fizzy chaulky finish. Not bad, but tons of other pale ales I would suggest first.
Brau Brothers Pale Ale;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Another gusher from the Braus. Murky tan-brown color. Massive off-white head. Mellow seawater aroma. Quite poundable. Leaning towards malt centered, with a lemony astringent hop flavor. A solid, middle of the road Pale Ale. Right on.
Brau Brothers Pale Ale;Marshall, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brau Brothers Brewing Company;33 cl bottle, Mulmur, ON, Canada via Lakeville (thanks Jim). Hazy deep golden colour, thin head. Peppery aroma, smooth with an immediate sharp bite that mellows.
Great Waters Marnie Dunkelwiezen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Great Waters Brewing;Actually is named Marnie Dunkelweizen, but...On-tap at the brewpub: Orange glow with a golden haze over it. Top is light and frothy with a puffy textuxe of white clouds and has a light hue of sand to its whiteness. Lacing is light and spotty. Have to agree that it doesn’t look dunkel-like but still looks appetizing enough to drink. Aroma is mostly lemony and wheaty, pretty straight forward and solidly present. More hefe-like then dunkel, but shows potential as it warms torwards some caramel malt. Flavors are OK, mild and pitched mostly in a hefe style of lemon, and boldly set with wheat tang and zip. Caramel malt undertones keep it from getting to raw. Nice yeasty dryness as it finishes as well as some light husky herbal spices. Lemon stays the at the main hold of flavor as does its wheaty tangyness. Feel is light to medium with a big wheaty backing, textured in a soft smooth, somewhat creamy elegance. Goes down pretty easy and is an adequate enough taster above and beyond other brews in the past from GW. Perhaps a bit understated though.
Great Waters Marnie Dunkelwiezen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Great Waters Brewing;No wheat flavors to speak of, or so timidly flavored and watered down for my played-out tastebuds to sense. Totally off-style and a real disappointment. Did taste a hint of lemon and bubblegum...if that counts for anything.
Great Waters Marnie Dunkelwiezen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Great Waters Brewing;"A terrible interpretation of a dunkelweizen. Gold color; looks filtered. Grassy aroma with only a hint of wheat. It isn’t even dunkel in color. Perhaps the worst beer I have had from Great Waters."
Town Hall Oak Aged French Abbey Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Dark amber, a light beige head with some nice lace. Aromas of plum, green grape skin, vanilla, cinnamon. Spicy, lively, and very interesting. The flavor is smooth, warm and a bit tanic. Not as much complexity to the flavor as the aroma, but still a very complex and interesting taste.
Town Hall Oak Aged French Abbey Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Dark orange color with no head. Nice aroma of fruit and oak with almost a hint of chocolate. The taste is just sinful... Lots of chocolate and fruit, though no particular fruit really jumps out at me. The vanilla from the oak lends a lovely finish.
Town Hall Oak Aged French Abbey Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"On tap at the brewery, labeled as ""Oak aged abbey"" and the other ratings match what I found, so I think this is the right place to put it. Fruity, bright and spicy with vinous dried fruit, caramel, toffee, noticeable alcohol and lots of oak tannins. Very interesting, the oak does not dominate the nose at all. Dark amber-orange in color with a thing, off-white head and I think there are some legs when I swirl it. Soft flavor at first with more of the dried fruit and caramel flavors with a bit of oak in the finish. The dried fruit tastes more and more like a red wine the more I drink. Not as complex in flavor as in aroma. Alcohol is present, nice and warming. Mouthfeel is a little creamy, while being fairly dry in the finish."
Town Hall Oak Aged French Abbey Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Clear deep orange. Oak and vanilla, punchy and fruity, lots of grapes. Rather strong. Sugary up front, then qutie dry at the end. Interesting, but could probably use a bit more time.
Town Hall Oak Aged French Abbey Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Dubbel;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"ABR ’05. Very dark brown with no head. A sweet beer; fairly thin body with some oak flavor. While not a bad beer; I don’t really see the ""abbey"" quality here. Maybe it needs some time to mature. After a few months of aging it has improved. More mellow flavors, and the malty qualties of a dubbel, as well as the oak, really show through and in a good way. Score raised."
Town Hall Minnesota Harvest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Growler… Lightly hazy burnt orange ale with a large, frothy, off-white head. Great retention. I can’t quite figure out the nose, but it seems metallic and just a tad acetic. Light-bodied with lively carbonation. The sweet maple syrup flavor also offers mild tartness. Sweet, lightly tangy, bone-dry finish. Odd bird, this one.
Town Hall Minnesota Harvest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Growler, courtesy SoLan. Pours a clear, dark, coppery red color with a small head of khaki foam. Settling quickly to a thin film, the head leaves minimal, obtuse spots of lacing behind. The nose is downright strange, showing a malt base of sticky white rice, cotton candy, milk sugar, and maple, with a doughy, dusty yeast profile. Hop character is pretty much non-existant, and the whole package smells unlike any brew I’ve ever encountered. Flavors again show odd caramel and condensed milk notes, with white rice sugars and a powdery, chalky, dough yeast finish. Bitterness is very low, coming across ever so slightly floral, with wisps of dry grass. The medium-full body is sweet, sugary, and sticky. Overall, this stuff is downright weird, and it just doesn’t suit me very well.
Town Hall Minnesota Harvest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours amber with off white, syrup and nutty/roasted malt come through on the nose and taste is a sweet mix of the syrup, spice taste from the wild rice and a nice roasted finish. Very interesting beer, and delicious!
Town Hall Minnesota Harvest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Growler solan: pours good dark ice tea brown with a small off white head. Aroma is good and earthy nice fresh hops some maple and a good malty presence. Flavor is good a liitle hops and some of the maple comes through too. Not a ton of flavors but what is there is pleasant. Nice rich malt came out as it warms.
Town Hall Minnesota Harvest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Courtesy Ty. Clear amber/brown, off white carbonation. Yeast forward aroma- airy and dusty. Mostly maple in the flavor. Strange brew. Sweet maple brew that’s not cloying. Toasty and nutty. Medium body, smooth. Easy to drink. Interesting, unique brew, cool to try.
Town Hall Minnesota Harvest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pint a dark red brown with short lived head. Aroma of malts and maple. The flavor is most sweet - maple... The palate is almost syrup like. Meh...
Town Hall Minnesota Harvest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Had a taste from the grimreeser. Another nice offering, but not something that would have me coming back for more.
Town Hall Minnesota Harvest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Red/brown colour with a bit of a head. Wisps of maple in the aroma. Light on the palate but very flavourful. The rice isn’t evident but the maple sure is. Very drinkable and again full of nice flavours.
Town Hall Minnesota Harvest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On tap. Aroma is on the tame side, can smell the syrup and wild rice. Nicely balanced flavor. Not as daring as I thought it would be, but solid.
Town Hall Minnesota Harvest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tap at the brewpub. Very light aroma with the maple syrup highlighted. Pours mostly amber with some brown highlights. Thin flavor of rice and maple. Medium to light bodied with average carbonation.
Delafield Blueberry Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Delafield Brewhaus;Strawberry-colored. Sweet blueberry aroma. Blueberry taste is light with a decent light lager malt background. A little fake tasting, but okay overall.
Delafield Blueberry Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Delafield Brewhaus;Purple liquid with a thin lid of white bubbles. Big blueberry aroma. Perhaps a hint of malt, but the blueberries are everywhere. Flavor as well is dominated by blueberries. Light and crisp feel. A touch of dough, but really just blueberries. If you like blueberries you should like this one. I like blueberries, but I like just a touch more malt in my brews.
Delafield Blueberry Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Delafield Brewhaus;Dark reddish amber with a thin white head. Pass me the flapjacks I’ve got some blueberry syrup here, at least on the aroma. Mild sweet malts are mixed in with that. Taste is more of the same. A little sticky but pretty good for a fruit beer.
Delafield Blueberry Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Delafield Brewhaus;On draught at the brewpub in Delafield, Wisconsin as Blueberry Lager. Pours a crystal clear pinkish amber brew with a light hot pink white head that quickly dissipates to a fine film and off-white ring. Aroma of tart loganberry character with some white bread, light grassy hops and some additional berry character. Taste is where the blueberry flavors really comes through. Light bodied, plenty of carbonation with a strong blueberry flavor on top of some light white bread malt and grassy hops. Finish has a light tart blueberry aftertaste, slightly metallic with a little pine flavor in the background.
Delafield Blueberry Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Delafield Brewhaus;Crimson Red Coloring with White Skin. Potent Blueberry Syrap Aroma. Carbonated, Strong Blueberry and Candy Sugar Notes with a Light Dry Ending. Quite Nice for a Light Fruit Beer.
Delafield Blueberry Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Delafield Brewhaus;"Sampler; If you like blueberrys you should try this one in area. Real good blueberry aroma and flavor. Darker shade of red and somewhat aciic. Great carbination with a good carbination belch on the finish. Good Stuff."
Delafield Blueberry Lager;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Delafield Brewhaus;Reddish color with no head. Very light blueberry aroma. The taste is much stronger on the fruit. There’s a lot of sugar, but it’s like a lemonade sugar, not syrupy. Monster carbonation, almost to the point of being soda, which I found to be a large downside.
Delafield Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;Sampled on draught at the GTMW ’08. Pours a semi-hazy reddish gray amber brew with a fast dissolving pinkish white head that dissipates nearly clean with a film top. Aroma of raspberry koolade with a touch of white bread dough and some flowery hops. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with a tart raspberry and bread flavor. Finish is semi-sweet with a lingering raspberry aftertaste that slowly disappears.
Delafield Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;On tap at the brewpub on 6/21/07: Pours a murky ruby red grapefruit color with an airy wispy-lacing light pinkish white head. Aroma of light raspberries and malted wheat with a hint of bready yeast. Body starts well-carbonated and lightly wheaty sweet with some mild clove and fresh tart raspberry flavor. Fairly full-bodied and well-balanced. A surprisingly enjoyable beer for the style.

Delafield Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;Enjoyed at Great Taste fest in Madison. Poured cloudy reddish pink with no head. Smelled like sugary raspberry candy. Flavor was more raspberry, but still very artificial. I would have liked some raspberry flavor a la NG’s Raspberry Tart. Oh well. Overall, this was rather wine-coolerish. It beats Leinie’s Berryweiss without question.
Delafield Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;On tap at the Delafield Brew Pub. Poured a cloudy ruby red/pink color (kinda looks like pink lemonade) with a very small sized white head. Aromas of raspberries, sweet berries, and very light wheat. Tastes of tart raspberries with very light wheat. Raspberries a tad on the artificial side.
Delafield Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;Pink, with a touch of amber, colored hazy liquid. Fluffy pink/white head. Sweet raspberry and banana aromas. Lots of raspberry candy flavors with only a minimal wheat contribution. Too candy sweet for me.
Delafield Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;Glowing Orange/Peach Coloring with White Skin. Sweet/Tart Raspberry Aroma. Also Some Light Spices..Notably Coriander. Flavor is Carbonated Sweet Raspberry and Succinct Tartness..Faint Wheat Notes on the Background, with a Sweet Raspberry Candy Aftertaste. Almost Crisp Mouthfeel.
Delafield Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;"Sampler; Dark pink body with good head and plenty of lacing. Had a good raspberry aroma and flavor. Slight tartness to it but overall a berry beer."
Delafield Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;"Murky, dark ruby grapefruit color with a dense, creamy and light pink head. Leaves sticky lacing as we go. Raspberry iced tea leads the aroma, followed by cloves, strawberry-banana smoothies and citric oranges. Fleeting sweetness at first quaff. Surprisingly retains the banana accents from the hefe yeast strain. Other flavors involve raspberry sweet tea, and lemon and orange citric proclamations; all void of searing acidity. Finishes like cranberry-orange muffins. Much better than expected, for what it’s worth."
Delafield Raspberry Weiss;Delafield, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Delafield Brewhaus;Pinkish color with no head. Definite raspberry aroma, but it has a Lysol quality to it. Unfortunately, that sticks around in the flavor. The raspberry itself backs off and is overshadowed by sweet wheat.
Bandana Octoberfest;Mankato, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Bandana Brewery;Mild and timid version, a little overly sweet and a hop bitterness than seemed somewhat overbearing. Just OK.
Bandana Octoberfest;Mankato, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Bandana Brewery;Bronze color. Very light malt aroma. Bitter flavor. It needs more malt and more balanced hops. Light body, dry finish.
Fitgers Double Daisy Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fitgers Brewhouse;Dark Brown Coloring with Sandy Ring. Very Rich Malt Presence and Light Floral Hop Aroma. Heavier Mouthfeel Than the Daisy #7. Hops are Far More Subtle as Well. Whereas the Daisy #7 Ale is Hop Dominant, This One is Wonderfully Balanced with a Nice Rich Malt Base and Dry Hops Coming Out at the End. Simply a Very Nice Brew.
Fitgers Double Daisy Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fitgers Brewhouse;Clear orange-fringed brown pour, with a tall head of creamy tand head. Looks like a real classic pour. Wicking hop strong aroma, bursting with rushes of grapefruit, floral, tart lemon and light apricots. A little buttery and a linger of potpourri. A very spicy malt, with a hot hops, tending to not be too well balanced, more cloying and acerbic. My battle with American Strong Ales continues, as this is a drawing board for toxic levels of sharp harsh hops that don’t balance, blend or transform. The alcohol is warming and counterpart to the hops. Rigid and unforgiving. Palate is rich, sweet, and a touch oaky. Seems like the Daisy times two, literally. More spice.
Fitgers Double Daisy Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fitgers Brewhouse;One of the best of the Twin Cities Autumn Brew Review this year. Red roasted malty sweetness: caramel and toffee predominantly, but then the strong hopping kicks in and it’s all grapefruit and pine resins. Very nicely brewed.
Fitgers Double Daisy Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fitgers Brewhouse;(GABF05) Clear medium brown body with beige head, nice lacing. Aroma is medium sweet, graepfruit, caramel. Taste is moderately sweet, grapefruit, light pine. Medium body with light resin.
Fitgers Double Daisy Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Fitgers Brewhouse;"One of the highlights of the 2005 ABR. Very powerful hops; so much so that it is definitely a sipper. Very dark red. Some herbal qualities in the aroma and flavor. Good work."
Saranac Oatmeal Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;22-Jan-11 (12-oz bottle: Obtained in trade with jah noth, thanks Dan!) Oatmeal stouts are pretty easy to drink as far as stouts go, so no surprise that Saranac has an entry in this style category. This is a mildly sweet, milk-chocolaty, lightly roasty, slightly ashy stout with light sweetness and gentle bitterness. It’s medium in weight, moderately carbonated, and fairly dry in the finish. Not all that aromatic, the nose offers chocolate, cocoa, and licorice. Dark-brown in color with clear, mahogany edges and a small, beige head that fully dissipates. Not bad, but not all that interesting either, so in other words, the typical Saranac beer!
Saranac Oatmeal Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle. Dark brown. Claims to be sweet, and is slightly so, but not overly. Less sweet than usual sweet stouts, with a good amount of hops. The oatmeal effect is rather east to miss, though. Good, drinkable, not really distinctive.
Saranac Oatmeal Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Looks dark brown, just this side of black. Puffy light brown head. No light can be seen. Nice brown lace. Lightly toasted malt aroma. Sweet like a mild chocolate. Sweetness is a nice mild balance. Less coffee. Hint of dark cherry/grape. Excellent. Only slightly biter, but with a more pronounced sweet counterbalance. It’s very good, and has a dry finish. Has some alcohol in the flavor. Feels thick and grainy, sandpaper. Substantial but not a choker. A nice, balanced stout. Has the thick chunky feel of an oatmeal, but a sweet backbone. Very nice.
Saranac Oatmeal Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Jason’s bottle from mixed six-pack. Substantial roast, though weak for style. This is a dry stout with lots of oatmeal. Black with big off-white head. black with big off-white head and lots of lace. Lactose acidic. Medium mouthfeel. Drinkability so-so.
Saranac Oatmeal Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a brown body with a tan head. Sweet and thin. Sugar notes, lactose, sweet maltose, and some light bitterness and oats. Thin and simple, not to good.
Saranac Oatmeal Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Eh a fairly average Stout. Decent chocolate and cofee flavors with pretty much the same aroma. It was a bit too watery.
Saranac Oatmeal Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Pours dark brown with a tan head. Smells of sweet malt and roasty with some spicy hints and dark fruit. Tastes sweet and roasty with a decent depth and a nutty finish.
Saranac Oatmeal Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Initially i was relatively impressed with saranac for this offering... But after the initial rush of sweet roasted malt, i labored through the second half of the beer thinking that once my palate was coated there were no other flavors offered. It was quite thin and very very generic...
Saranac Oatmeal Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Nice dark pour with a tan head. Slight roast coffee/malt aromas. Kind of lighter bodied than expected. Roasted malt/mocha/coffee flavors in limited amounts. Dry on the finish. Not bad, kind of like their Russian Imperial, there are just some things missing. If you were just starting try darker brews, this could be one to try as a warm up.
Saranac Oatmeal Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Pours dark brown nearly black with small tan head. Watery mouthfeel for a stout with slight roasted flavor. A little bitter on the finish. Seems more like a porter than a stout to me.
Saranac Belgian Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;It has a thin off white head over an amber color brew that looks to have to have been filtered. The aroma has a definite Belgian malt and yeast character that I like. Its flavor is very malty and sweet with some classic Belgian yeast and fair amount of hops that give it some citrus and bitter notes. The palate is medium bodied with a nice smooth texture and carbonation. Overall it’s not as complex as other Belgians but it is still a decent brew.
Saranac Belgian Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a chalice. The appearance was a delicate hazy amber color with a decent white foamy head that fizzled into the body in about less than thirty seconds. There was some light lacing but for the most part it left some to be desired. The smell had a weird combination of toffee and caramel malts overpowering any degree of Belgian spices. The taste was overly sweet and really do the beer any favors of letting any aspect of true Belgian-ness to come out. On the palate, it wanted to show a medium sort of body but came across pretty light to show a fairly sessionable aspect to it. The carbonation was pretty sharp. Overall, I wasn’t exactly a fan of this one. Too bad I live too far away from this company to ask for a new one to see if it was a bad three bottles that I had when I first had this.
Saranac Belgian Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Lacks the assertiveness and character of a true trappist. Weak and watery, though the appearance is decent.
Saranac Belgian Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle poured into a pint glass from a sampler pack. Pours a pale red color. Little head, no lacing. Faint aroma of sweetness and malt. Taste is also sweet and malty. Nothing special. Medium body, smooth finish. Pretty drinkable for a Belgian Ale but nothing to write home about.
Saranac Belgian Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"12 oz bottle served in a snifter. A bit annoyed at the outset that Saranac simply describes this as a ""Belgian style ale"" on the label (although there’s a more information in the fine print on the neck label) -- Belgian ales are so varied that this is virtually useless. Pours a cloudy orange-amber with a short-lived off-white head. Vestiges of the head remain for a while and some thin lacing is left on the glass. Medium-light body with near medium carbonation. A little watery. The aroma is fruity, bready and appealing, but too faint. The flavor is fruity, bready and spicy, with what I would describe as a Belgian style spice component. It has a slight earthiness and yeastiness yet is quite drinkable. O: a decent and economical departure from your typical American beer, but a not a strong rendition of a ""Belgian ale"""
Saranac Belgian Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Refrigerated bottle poured into a trappist glass. Pours transparent amber with finger off-white head that lingers. Good lacing, medium body, well carbonated, and caramel malt aroma. Taste is caramel malt, spicy yeast, some bread, and hint of candy sugar. Just get a Leffe Blonde.
Saranac Belgian Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"12 oz bottle – From the “Beers of Summer"" variety pack. A taste of Lemon Zest! Poured an orangish color with a nice head. The aroma was sweet malts and a yeast. The flavor was very sweet malts, hint of yeast, and a lemon citrus rush. The lemon permeates this white ale."
Saranac Belgian Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Way too light to be an authentic Belgian Ale. Can taste the sugar notes but not much else.
Saranac Belgian Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Medium color, modest carbonation, light bitterness, good feel on palette with ""Christmas tree"" aftertaste"
Saranac Belgian Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Poured into a tulip. 4.0 A: Amber color. Decent head with average retention and plenty of lacing. 3.5 S: Spicy, almost like a mix of pepper and cloves. Sweet malts and a touch of wheatiness. Not really much hop character. 3.5 T: This is my first Belgian pale ale, so I don’t have much to compare it too. Tastes like a tripel blended with an American pale ale. A lot of malt character and somewhat sweet. No clove, but pepper is there. A bit of light fruit. Hoppy finish which brings balance. 3.5 M: Smooth, good carbonation. Medium body. Nothing special, but not lacking. 4.0 D: This is one of Saranac’s better beers, though it’s still nothing special. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 01-07-2009 05:14:03
Bluegrass Doppelbock;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bluegrass Brewing Company;On tap at BBC in st mathews. Nice Dark Brown/blck color with offwhite creamy head. Tastes and smells similar to celebrator with coffee and chocolate hints in the aftertastes
Bluegrass Doppelbock;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draft: Auburn in color. Thin but silky layer of gray-tan bubbles. Lovely aroma of brown sugar, plums, Munich malt, raisins, and licorice. Trace medicine and burnt tobacco scents. Scattered pricks of bubbles. Thick and viscid. Initially sweet but tolerable with loads of fresh fruitcake. Softer bready malt foundation is coarsened by a light medicinal astringency. Touch of plum acidity cuts the datelike sweetness and lessens the thickness a notch. Cleanly fruity with hints of passionfruit. Spicy note of anise harmoniously gels with soft floral hops. Finishes thick but equally bright despite the full-on Munich weightiness, as peppery alcohol lends depth and dryness. A tough style to execute, but they’ve done a commendable job with this.
Zlatopramen Dvanáctka 12°;Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Zlatopramen (Heineken);Picked up at Maruhn Getränke in Darmstadt. Pours a crisp clear golden yellow color with a fizzy white head. Aromas of hops, grass, and grains. Flavor is a nice crisp hoppy/grain taste with a nice clean finish.
Zlatopramen Dvanáctka 12°;Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Zlatopramen (Heineken);Bottle, thanks pivnizub. Fatty malt and grassy bitterhop aroma. Amber, off-white head. Light caramelized, hayish malt base, light grape notes, good load of herbal hops - fairly agressive and not that harmonic in my oppinion. Sparkly, chewy mouthfeel. Nuts and almonds retronasal.
Zlatopramen Dvanáctka 12°;Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Zlatopramen (Heineken);"Bottle (333ml) Deep golden, smaller persistent white head, buttery, sweet-malty nose with restrained hoppy traces; solid sweet-bitter flavour, solid malty base; lingering aromatic-hoppy finish with a bitter aftertaste. a very typical Bohemian Pilsener, popular -as the label claims - with emperors and kings: as Ustecké Cisaøské Pivo - Aussiger Kaiser Bier............"

Zlatopramen Dvanáctka 12°;Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Zlatopramen (Heineken);Bottle: Clear red/yellow colour, nice head. Aroma of a big sweet maltyness, hay and gras, with dry hopy nose. Flavor is almost the same, thin mouth feeling, with a short finish.
Zlatopramen Dvanáctka 12°;Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Zlatopramen (Heineken);bottle, bought at Pivni Galerie. Zlatopramen 12° is not easy to find in Prague. Golden yellow, small head. Very low carbonation. Malty and full-bodied, hoppy finish. I suspect, the crown cap was not properly attached and therefore the beer lost in quality. Will be re-rated as soon as I can get hold of another bottle.

Z Street Vienna Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ipswich Ale Brewery;An excellent example of the style. Hoppy for the style, but not over the top, so it works, with rich amber malt flavor, and perfect balance. A good beer, easy to drink and tasty. Reminded me of 7 Stern Maerzen from Vienna.
Z Street Vienna Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pours hazy golden color with a medium frothy off white head. Nose is fruity, floral and malty. Initial taste spicy, mild astrigent bitterness, rye, woody notes. Mid palate to finish displays the sharp hop bitterness touching upon some sweet malt but not very balanced. Some fruits and caramel are apparent. Average head retention, palate is average. Crisp, but lacks flavor and dimensionality.

Z Street Vienna Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12 oz bottle from Table and Vine in Northampton, MA (September 2006) enjoyed a bit below cellar temperature form a Hair of the Dog glass. Medium fluffy off-white head of average duration topping and oily solid amber body, just a hint of lacing....light malty nose reminiscen of rye & wheat toast, light spicy, faint woody hops....sweet, smooth body, juicy with a light banana-lemon character, lightly bready/doughy maltiness all supported by a just dyamite mouthfeel, really full and rich, naturally carbonated and redolent of German yeast with a faintly mineralic/metallic tang at the end that cuts the developing sugariness just perfectly. Very very solid, another fine addition to this underrated brewery’s portfolio.
Z Street Vienna Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Clean lager character, but with full malty, nutty flavor. Not a lot of hops. Toasty malt. Reminds me of a loaf of good bread. There’s really just nothing else in here. Did they even bother to hop this? How is this not a Marzen? Tasty, but very simple.
Z Street Vienna Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"(Bottle from Julio’s Liquors) Pours deep amber with about 1 1/2"" of soft biscuit head, receding to about 1/2"". Nose is mostly light hops - mostly fruity, slightly flowery. As head recedes there is more caramel aroma, then while drinking there is a great toasted caramel aroma. Sticking my nose in a willibecher full of this actually transported me to southern Germany - nice! Lacing somewhat sloppy. Mouthfeel smooth, pretty full, touch prickly in finish. Flavor is of mild hop fruitiness and bitterness overlaying the nice toasted caramel maltiness. Slightly bitter finish. Good."
Z Street Vienna Lager;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"This is perhaps the BEST Vienna I’ve had. Even though Z Street has now gone to contract brewing, they have apparently done their homework with this one. Pours lovely, frothy with a rich red copper color. Pleasant aroma, and a powerful nutty-roasty taste. Malt city! MMMMMMMM! Post-script: Z Street continues to have quality control problems, in my opinion, going back to their days in Fitchburg. Thus, I have demoted this beer on my ""overall""... for some reason, this batch is hoppier - not cool."

Flavor is moderate caramel - toffe sweet and light bitter with a average duration. Body is light to medium, texture is watery, carbonation is soft. [20090125]

Sail & Anchor None and Buckleys Wheat Beer;Fremantle, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sail & Anchor Brewery;On the ill advice of the head brewer of S & A, I thought I’d give this a try anyway whilst perusing around in Freo. The heat of the day called for something atleast a little admirable, but this was actually the worst of the lot, and for a brewer to admit to a bad batch I’d say that was the only admirable part. Pity I couldn’t tell him that at the time. Poured a clear, dull medium gold with a well charged surge of carbonation raising to a big fluffy white crown that lasted. Aussie lager for looks, sadly very similar inside. Strange mix of metal shards, watery lemon and orange cordial, and Cooper’s Draught™ malt extract on the nose. Quite tannic, white-wine like and metallic in the mouth with a brush of DMS making like cooled boiled cabbages right through into the swallow. Aftertaste was gassy with more CO2 than flavour dissipating the fermentation nasties, and some tinny notes lingered in the mouth making me wish I’d ordered a Brass Monkey. This wasn’t good at all so in fairness it will be one for a re-rate, so for now there’s none and buckley’s of me touching another glass of it!
Sail & Anchor None and Buckleys Wheat Beer;Fremantle, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sail & Anchor Brewery;Dirty blond and hazy with a lacy head. Wheaty and slightly spicy, nice flavours of toasted wheat without being estery at all. Thirst quenching on this 30+ degree day!
Sail & Anchor None and Buckleys Wheat Beer;Fremantle, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sail & Anchor Brewery;Nice golden body with a medium size white head. No lacing. Not too fussed on the aroma, it reminds me like one of my early homebrews, dusty. Zesty and slightly spicy flavours (cloves) upfront with not a lot backing it up. Faint banana and lemon sherbet towards the end. Last weeks brewberry ale went down a lot easier.
Hebridean Seaforth Ale;Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hebridean Brewing Co.;Bottle in Stornoway, Iske of Lewis. Pours clear golden with decent head and bubbles. High carbonation. Aroma is hops. First impression was sour, then a more balanced blend of hops and citrus. This being said, sour and bitter combine for a very refreshing drink, but there is no malty ore grainy counterpart. However, I do like the sour/bitter aspect and thus rate this beer high. Good!
Hebridean Seaforth Ale;Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hebridean Brewing Co.;Bottle from Cafe Kisimul, Barra. Pours clear, bright amber. Nose of orange peel, salt, resin. Taste has a savoury quality, salty and a bit spicy, bitter, apricots, peaches.
Hebridean Seaforth Ale;Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hebridean Brewing Co.;500ml bottle from an Edinburgh Aldi during their 2014 Scottish beer promotion campaign. BBE Aug 15, poured into a UK pint sleeve at home during Feb 15. Poured cold, as the the rear label said to serve chilled. Slight haze to the golden body, carbonation bubbles rising through up to the full, deep white foaming blanket on top. Malty, grainy nose, sour notes too: might be skunked. Taste is sour vegetables with a malty tone, this isn’t right. Bright lights of Aldi may well have got through the glass, or we have a yeast infection somewhere. It has been kept cool and in the dark since coming to England. This is a live rating and it might turn into a drain pour for a lesser man than me! Bad home brew is the best I can say about the beer, sorry but this is not good. Lacing is good and clingy, beer bad and mingy.
Hebridean Seaforth Ale;Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hebridean Brewing Co.;500ml bottle from Aldi, Prestwick Toll, Prestwick - clear amber brown. a few small rising bubbles, no head, malt dominates a weak aroma, mild sour malty, vegetable flavour, dry finish
Hebridean Seaforth Ale;Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hebridean Brewing Co.;500ml bottle from Aldi. Hazy amber brown, not much head. Oaty resin malt aroma. Sour vegetable caramel malt flavour. Watery with bitter aftertaste. Not had a good beer from this brewery yet.
Hebridean Seaforth Ale;Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hebridean Brewing Co.;500ml bottle from Aldi. Pours clear gold, thin white head. Aromas are butterscotch and lemon. Taste is more of the same. Overly sweet finish. Not great.
Hebridean Seaforth Ale;Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hebridean Brewing Co.;Bottle at home. Pours golden, nose is caramel, buttery, taste is sweet, dry toffee, rich, caramel.
Hebridean Seaforth Ale;Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hebridean Brewing Co.;On cask at Cloisters. Pours a dark golden colour with a decent white head. Aroma of yeast, caramel and treacle. Similar yeast and caramel flavours with barley and hay also. Mild carbonation and a foamy mouth-feel. Not for me.
Hebridean Seaforth Ale;Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hebridean Brewing Co.;[cask at SRAF’09, Edinburgh] Very light, golden pale ale with a decent white head – but one that recedes very quickly. Grassy, slightly sweet aroma. A touch soapy on the palate but has that bitterness of a decent golden ale – a pretty good start to the festival [25062009]
Hebridean Seaforth Ale;Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hebridean Brewing Co.;Cask. Decent hop and fruit aroma. Flavor is watery and hoppy. Not very pleasant—no malt character at all… Tastes like there might be seaweed in there, or at least sea salt. Rather nasty. Not to my taste.
Cascade Lakes Warrior Fresh Hop;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;Fresh Hop festival 2008. Another nice fresh hop beer, more bitter and floral then some, probably went with a balance of dried and fresh hops. Citrus and pine in the nose, crisp and floral. Pours amber with a smooth white head.
Cascade Lakes Warrior Fresh Hop;Redmond, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cascade Lakes Brewing Co.;Tap at Hood River Hops Fest. Medium amber colored with slight opacity. Smallish white head. Piney hop aroma is fairly dominant. Medium bodied. Ample piney hop bitterness is barely mitigated by the malt bill, borders harsh. Fair, an interesting beer to isolate Warrior hops.
Nanbu Bijin Junmai Tokubetsu Sake;Ninohe City, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Tokubetsu;Nanbu Bijin Shuzo Co., Ltd. (formerly Kuji Shuzo);300ml bottle from Japan Centre, London. Clear / slightly yellowish colour. Rice, floral, stone fruit, peach, milky, coconut, honeydew melon, umami, light booze - not too bad for abv, light banana, light pineapple. I am a complete sake noob and don't really know how to rate this stuff yet, this is pretty nice though
Nanbu Bijin Junmai Tokubetsu Sake;Ninohe City, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Tokubetsu;Nanbu Bijin Shuzo Co., Ltd. (formerly Kuji Shuzo);This is a well respected brew in the sake world and deserved winner of the 2017 IWC award. It's a good value brew and versatile for food pairing - a safe bet. A subtle whiff of banana penny sweets on the nose is inviting. Then it's a soft and clean junmai with melon and pear flavours, moderate acidity and umami taste that emerges as the bottle warms from chilled to room temperature. You could do a lot worse than this all-rounder. Ignore other comments on colour, absolutely nothing wrong with it.
Porterhouse Kolsch;Dublin, Ireland;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Porterhouse Brew Co.;Keg at Porterhouse Central, Dublin. It pours a clean golden color with a small white head. Aroma is grainy and light grassy and leafy. Taste is medium bitter with notes of grains, hay, grass, dried leaves. Light bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, sessionable and decently tasty
Porterhouse Kolsch;Dublin, Ireland;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Porterhouse Brew Co.;Draught at Temple Bar. Clean gold with a thin head. Aroma is sweet malt. Flavour is honey malt, buttery, much heavier texture than the german ones. Dry malty finish, sticks to the lips.
Porterhouse Kolsch;Dublin, Ireland;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Porterhouse Brew Co.;Keg@ ph temple bar clear burnished gold, white lacing, butterscotch diacetyl, medium body, slight vegetal astringency, dry finish.
Porterhouse Kolsch;Dublin, Ireland;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Porterhouse Brew Co.;Tap in Covent Garden. Very pale golden colour. Thin light crispy minerally aroma. Decent balance in a crisp light refreshing beer. Bright and lightly citric.
Porterhouse Kolsch;Dublin, Ireland;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Porterhouse Brew Co.;Crisp clean clear yellow colour,with a light hoppy nose and light hop fruity flavour with just a hint of bitternees
Porterhouse Kolsch;Dublin, Ireland;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Porterhouse Brew Co.;On tap at the Porterhouse, Covent Garden. Small white head, fairly sparkling golden beer. Very fruity, almost overwhelming. Peaches and apricots. Quite true to its type, but the type is not the most exiting in the wold!
Porterhouse Kolsch;Dublin, Ireland;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Porterhouse Brew Co.;Tap@The Porterhouse, Covent Garden, London. Pretty tame/thin. Some subtle hints of melon and citrus, but the mouthfeel is to grainy and thin, and the finish is watery. I wasn’t expecting much, and didn’t get much.
Porterhouse Kolsch;Dublin, Ireland;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Porterhouse Brew Co.;Keg at Porterhouse, Covent Garden. Golden beer with thin white head. Grainy nose, bit of sourness in mouth some citrus lemon and drying hops. Good kolsch, very refreshing
Koten Sharaku Junmai Daiginjo Sake;Aizuwakamatsu-shi, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Higashiyama Shuzo;Almost clear pour. Nice fruit flavor with that sweetness as well, which made it nice to sip over and over.
Koten Sharaku Junmai Daiginjo Sake;Aizuwakamatsu-shi, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Higashiyama Shuzo;slight off clear color,the flavor was somewhat mildly sweet in a way with a bit of a fruity side and the alcohol is present but in a mild way.Kind of a pleasant brew not really over powering but decent enough to make this a brew you could finish in one sitting.
Koten Sharaku Junmai Daiginjo Sake;Aizuwakamatsu-shi, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Higashiyama Shuzo;The Koten Sharaku is at the low end of the daiginjo spectrum. It’s price makes that clear at around $10/300ml and its color contains a slight tinge of yellowness, which should not be there at all. Whatever. It’s all about the taste, right? Taste side by side with three other sakes (2 cheap Sho Chiku Bais and a Nanbu Bijin Tokubetsu), I can unequivocally pronounce this Koten Sharuku the winner - as it should be. The sake had its alcohol relatively well hidden, and just as important it had a rich, buttery mouthfeel with a dryish Chardonnaylike flavor. Lots of flavor was present - sort of floral/candyish. Enjoyable, yet still not as good as most Daiginjos.
Elliot Glacier Lolo Pass Pumpkin Ale;Parkdale, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Elliot Glacier Public House;Draft at Hood River Hops Fest 2007. A hazy amber beer with a thin yellowish head. The aroma is sweet malty and hoppy, while the flavor is sweet malty with a spicy note of cinnamon.
Elliot Glacier Lolo Pass Pumpkin Ale;Parkdale, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Elliot Glacier Public House;Tap at Hood River Hops Fest. Deeper amber colored with a very scant whitish head. Slightly hazy. Aroma is nicely pumpkin and spice. Slight sweet honey there also. Medium bodied. Clove, cinnamon, honey and pumpkin flavor with a decent earthy hop presence. Very well done.

Tring Huck Me Buck;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tring Brewery;Cask at the Cambridge Blue, Cambridge, 03-10-09 Pours tawny colour with a white head, there are a few stray bubbles at the edges.

Tring Huck Me Buck;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tring Brewery;Cask Conditioned at the Market Porter, Borogh, London. Chesnut coloured body with small bright shiny white head. There’s a decent malty opening on the palate but the beer quickly runs out of steam and lacks bitter bite!
Tring Huck Me Buck;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tring Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), Bedford Beer Festival, October 2005. Appearing for the first time in Autumn 2005, whether this is or one of or will become a recurring seasonal remains to be seen. Attractive rich deep brown colour. Caramel malt dominates, although there is some balancing underlying hop presence. I found the mouthfeel somehow a little sticky. Decent enough.
Tring Huck Me Buck;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tring Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Fire Station, Whitley Bay 02/11/2005. Amber coloured beer with some fruitiness and sourness in there. A creamy malt finish with a slight bitterness.
Tring Huck Me Buck;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tring Brewery;Also very light for serve, and a little foam, like a juice more than a beer, but was nice, at leats it was refreshing.
Tring Huck Me Buck;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tring Brewery;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Bedford BF. A dark brown coloured beer with a malty berry fruit aroma.

The Livery Oktoberfest;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Livery;"Draft to taster at the brewpub. Looks solid; a fairly transparent golden orange with things white head that quickly dissipates into bubbly lacing. Smells malty with notes of caramel alongside notes of lager yeast and a touch of grain. Tastes like it smells with a medium-light to medium-bodied mouthfeel. A decent example of the style."
The Livery Oktoberfest;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Livery;Sampler pour on tap at the brewpub (Benton Harbor, MI). Pours a richer orange golden hue, darker body, lots of orange, good haze with a small frothy white head, dies to a film and laces small. Quite light in hue for the style. Aromas are gentle spice, oranges, bready and doughy malts. Some grass, gentle toast. Initial is medium bodied, perhaps a touch mellow, but firm. Flavors offer toast, biscuits, and gentle carmelization. Touches of spice, dry earthy hops, some caramel and spice really hit the middle. Backend is a bit sweet, gentle spice, touches of fruit. Dryness gives it’s best effort, but never really takes over again. A touch sweet. Ok.
The Livery Oktoberfest;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Livery;Had this on draught at the brewpub. Delicious. Malty, chocolate and a touch of dryness. Outstanding.

The Livery Oktoberfest;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Livery;From the tap this pours a pale golden amber body with a good lacing head. It has an aroma of toasted grains, caramel, and fresh apples. These blend together pretty smoothly in the flavor matched by a soft floral/grassy bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. Quite quaffable. The Livery, Benton Harbor, MI

Mansfield Dark Mild (Cask);Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);First tasted this in the Ale House, Paisley in November 1992. Cask, handpump dispense. Dull ruby black in colour with a thin creamy white head. Slight roast malt in the short nose. Thin watery mouthfeel and good lacing. Dark malts give a maltloaf base with sweet treacle toffee evident. Dusty hop prickle gives a dry aftertaste which is short lived. Finish is very weak with just a hint of caramel sweetness. An ok session mild but not that adventureous.
Mansfield Dark Mild (Cask);Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);Cask Handpump at the London Hotel, Llandudno 05/05/2008 (As Banks’s Dark Mild) Fruity aroma.

Mansfield Dark Mild (Cask);Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);Cask (handpump), Snowdonia Park Hotel, Waunfawr, October 2005. Nothing of much interest here. Zero aroma. Dry, ashy mouthfeel, with light caramel malt. Quite bitter, for a mild. Very dry, but not much roasty character, or depth of flavour. OK for quaffing but doesn’t stand up to close scrutiny.
Mansfield Dark Mild (Cask);Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);Bland beer with smooth caramel and sweetness. Nothing really stands out as being of interest and a dull caramelly finish obscures anything else. (Cask @ Swan & Railway, Wigan)
Mansfield Dark Mild (Cask);Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);Cask Conditioned Dark color. A quite simple beer, just some caramel and a light fruitness (rhubarb).

Mansfield Dark Mild (Cask);Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);Cask Conditioned at The Quiet Woman, Earl Sterndale, Derbys. Dark Mild that is now produced by W&D. Nicely set up mild with thin apple flavour and roasted hazelnut, but overall just too thin and boiled to get good marks. Average.
Mansfield Dark Mild (Cask);Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);Mine was a cask conditioned Dark Mild rather than the usual keg that is served in the Midlands. The pint was pulled at the now rather seedy and run down Market Porter in London. This Mild has been served in the area around Nottingham since the late 1800''s. Mansfield was, however, bought by Banks (Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries) in 1999, and the Nottinghamshire brewery closed down - all beer production being moved to Wolverhampton. This is light & refreshing, yet with oodles of roastiness and well sucked licorice. There are also some mild caramel flavours. There is a disturbing hop awareness in the finish - slightly stewed and unpleasant. A decent mild.
Tröegs Pothole Pils;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tröegs Brewing Company;tap at Kclingers. Pours a clean light yellow golden color with a fizzy white head. Aroma is sweet citrus and grassy hops. Flavor is lively and sweet citrus with grapefruit and mild honey.

Pours a light gold, slight haze from the keg and a nice long lasting frothy white head. Aroma is a pure Noble hop goodness. Lots of lightly fruity floral aromas balanced with pure pilsner malt. Flavor is loaded with hops as well- kinda reminded me a bit of the Victory Braumeister pils. Good bready malt backbone on lightly grassy hops, some spiciness, and more flowery hops. I love Hersbrucker hops. I wish my Hersbrucker pils turned out this good.
Tröegs Pothole Pils;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tröegs Brewing Company;Sweet, grainy, malt aroma with grassy, lightly citrus hops is lightly fruity. Clear golden body is topped by a low, white, mostly diminishing head. Grainy malts coupled with grassy, citrus hop flavours, a touch of butter and mild finishing bitterness. Light body with initially strong carbonation that does not last. Sampled at Kennett Square Brewfest 2005.
Tröegs Pothole Pils;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tröegs Brewing Company;Pours a light straw. Aroma is honey, floral, slight fruit. Flavor is grain, mild honey, and floral hops. LIght bodied nice refreshing pils that still retains a sturdy flavor.
Tröegs Pothole Pils;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tröegs Brewing Company;Pretty citrus taste, carbonated well. Very different from anything else troegs brings to the table. Kinda light, drinkable, almost tastes like some macros of similiar nature.

Schäff-Bräu Feuerfest Edel Bier;Treuchtlingen, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Mittelbayerischer Getränkevertrieb / Schäffbräu (BHB);Sweet, boozy but actually quite nice. 25 years past its due date! But pretty good. Though it tastes like a liquid molasses syrup it is pretty amazing.
Schäff-Bräu Feuerfest Edel Bier;Treuchtlingen, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Mittelbayerischer Getränkevertrieb / Schäffbräu (BHB);330 ml bottle (old rating). Dark brown body with a small off-white head. Strong aroma of slightly roasted dark malt, smooth caramel, dry fruit and some cellar notes. Flavor is very sweet dark malt, smooth and gentle roasted, caramel, dry fruit, syrup and warming alcohol. Full bodied and long lasting aftertaste with sweet malt and dry fruit. It’s quite alcoholic by the end, but the sweetness seems to cope very well with the alcohol, it doesn’t really feel boozy.
Schäff-Bräu Feuerfest Edel Bier;Treuchtlingen, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Mittelbayerischer Getränkevertrieb / Schäffbräu (BHB);Bottle. Clear chestnut body with a tiny offwhite head. Aroma is lots of dark fruits, raisins, figs, chocolate, notes of alcohol, oak, light vanilla notes. Flavor is dark fruit, oak, alcohol, vanilla. Ends up boozy. Surprisingly good. Would love another bottle.

Lovely.
Schäff-Bräu Feuerfest Edel Bier;Treuchtlingen, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Mittelbayerischer Getränkevertrieb / Schäffbräu (BHB);I was lucky to get a bottle of this from ebay. The bottle looks absolutely great, how can a bottle look better? That wax seal is phenomenal. The beer in the glass is dark brown, very small head. Dusty-old aroma. Starts a bit washy, my first thought was: the beer is wide past its prime. But: its getting better with every gulp. Still a bit washy beginning, but then with wonderful malty-strong notes, rusty, also a bit fruity like plum. The finish is alcoholic-warming, also shows some caramell notes. Wonderful longlasting aftertaste. I enjoyed the whole bottle and that was really a pleasure. Wish I had more of this.
Schäff-Bräu Feuerfest Edel Bier;Treuchtlingen, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Mittelbayerischer Getränkevertrieb / Schäffbräu (BHB);(Bottle 33 cl) Cool vintage style bottle and label with a wax seal to guarantee a lagering period of 12 months (sometimes they even let it rest for a stunningly 18 months!). Dark brown with a reddish glow, almost no head and close to being completely flat. Sediment at the bottom. Extremely complex beer reminding me of some of the best Belgian trappists or noble desert wines. Notes of roasted malt, overripe fruit, cane sugar, dates, prunes, raisins - anything dark and rich and yummy. A truly great beer to be enjoyed in small sips over a long winter night. Had this not been German I probably would’ve termed it a Barleywine. 230401
McKenzie Dark Saison;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse - Dark;McKenzie Brew House;Time to catch up before BCTC. Bottle at CL Rosso release. Thanks to all the RB’ers and BA’s that brought great beer. I know I got this one from Dickinsonbeer. From growler. Reddish with big bubble head. Strong sugary bubblegum spice mild red fruit and spice with clean finish. Nice.
McKenzie Dark Saison;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse - Dark;McKenzie Brew House;Bottle at the Otown Throwdown. Dark brown amber body. Very rootbeer-like and very peppery. Roasted malts and spicy feel. Really liked this. Hope to have again.
McKenzie Dark Saison;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse - Dark;McKenzie Brew House;Bottle... C&P’sLYFO Throwdown... Clear amber/copper ale with a little, fizzy, white head. The aroma, to me, mainly suggests ginger and sassafras. Light-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and modest carbonation. Bitter, spicy and thin. Abrasive, moderately bitter, dry finish. Not quite my cup of tea, but thanks to Dickinsonbeer for sharing the bottle! Most attendees really seemed to like it. * * Video = http://homepage.mac.com/maltajo/RATEBEER/iMovieTheater10.html
McKenzie Dark Saison;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse - Dark;McKenzie Brew House;In short: A spicy and semi-wild toasted Saison. Very good. How: Bottle 22oz (hand bottle I think). Post-EBF tasting. Big thanks to Dickinsonbeer The look: Slightly cloudy golden copper body topped by a small off-white head In long: Nose blends spiciness and wilderness. Taste has “rough” toasted crunchy malts, caramel pastry, semi-wild yeast, spicy character, tree bark. Semi-fluffy body. Another excellent beer on a night when I had way too much to drink again. Way too much to drink. But I never hate myself in the morning. I sleep ‘til noon.
McKenzie Dark Saison;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse - Dark;McKenzie Brew House;Bottle, courtesy Dickinsonbeer. In a day full of damn fine beers, this one might just have been the most interesting and unique of the bunch. The pour yields a lightly hazy body body that is a rusty, reddish brown in color. A small, frothy, khaki colored head leaves spotty lace. The nose is off the wall, spicy gingerbread cake and dessert bread dough showing in the malty base, followed by layer upon layer of spice and fruit. Cinnamon, raisin, banana, vanilla, and clove all make their presence felt. Hints of dark rum and toasted rye also show. Flavors are similarly structured, again quite bready and cake like, with wintery spice elements and dark fruits throughout. Gingerbread shows most prominently, and the cinnamon really lends a spicy kick. Substantial and smooth bodied, with a well concealed alcohol presence. This quirky brew is really, really cool.

Huge malty backbone to go with it. The flavor was much like the aroma, very spicy with big doses of that clove and some numeg as well. very big on the flavor, a little syrupy n its texture and mild carbonaton in the mouthfeel. Nice little treat this one was.

McKenzie Dark Saison;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse - Dark;McKenzie Brew House;Growler shared by dickensonbeer at the Rosso release. Very dark brown beer with a light tan head. Aroma is quite lovely. Soft fruit and a bit of light sweet spiciness. There is a bit of licorice and a kiss of toasted wheat/rye spiciness as well. Light citrusy note with a kiss of light mintiness toward the back. The flavour is a bit grainy with a bit of soft herbal flavour. As it warms, there are a few overly sweet notes as well, but overall, it’s a pretty nice beer.

Deep, clear copper colored brew with a fair sized off-white head. great lacing is left behind. Superbly floral hop aroma. Medium to full bodied.

Pelican Elemental Ale (2005);Pacific City, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pelican Brewing Company;On tap this pours amber, very clear, with a small white head. Very big green hop aroma with just a touch of caramel sweetness. This beer had a bit more normal hop character than the deschutes fresh hop, while still retaining the massive fresh green hop taste. The green hops kinda give it an almost tea like character.
Goose Eye Fairly Mild;Bingley, West Yorkshire, England;Mild Ale;Goose Eye Brewery;June, 2005. The Maltings, York. Soft caramel mild. Some chocolate notes. An OK sort of beer.
OHaras Octoberfest;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;Pours a clear light copper amber with two inches of creamy near-white foam. Decent head retention, adequate lacing. Lightly toasted malt in the aroma. The flavor is mainly toasted malt that overshadows the caramel malt at first. There is a faint fruitiness and dry toasted malt in the finish. While drinking the second pint, I no longer find the caramel malt to be overshadowed, in fact it tastes pretty good. Almost medium bodied with solid carbonation.
OHaras Octoberfest;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;Pretty, shimmering clear auburn. Slight nose, thin caramel, flavor is sweet, thin caramel, and light biscuity malts.
OHaras Octoberfest;St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;OHaras Brewpub and Restaurant;They came close to the mark. Nice bronze color, but minimal malt flavor or aroma. What was there was pleasant, but this seemed watered down as if a Marzen-light.
York Royal York;York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);June, 2005. Last Drop Inn, York. Wow! Lovely golden bitter with a refreshing rush of dusky citric nibbles. Nice one.
Kraftbrau Raspberry Wheat;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Kraftbrau Brewery;On tap at Kraftbrau. Cloudy yellow body, thin off-white head. Light raspberry syrup aroma. The flavor was surprisingly subtle, with light notes of raspberry merely complementing the wheat malts and banana/clove yeast flavors. The latter dominates the flavor profile. This could be classified as a Hefeweizen because of the sparing use of raspberry to enhance the palate. Perhaps this is a pathway for brewers who want to use fruit to accentuate, rather than dominate, their beers to follow. Light-bodied, refreshing, and well-done. A good one to finish before the New Pornographers show at the hot, smoky, dirty Club Soda.

Nethergate Lemon Head (Cask);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Cask. Without guidance I would not have spotted the ginger in the scent. For me it was funky and spicy like a curried burp. And I like my blondes blonde. This can pass for amber with a thin lace top. Fortunately after an unalluring start it settles well in the palate so that the finish is far better. Not sure if it would sell under the name lemon bottom but its nether regions are better than those closer to the gate.

Murray's Export Scottish Ale;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Scottish Ale;Murrays Cerveza Artesanal;"Draught in Cossab. A strange brew, lots of phenols and smokiness, then a toffee-malt finish and dryness.

This came out a full-to-the-brim pint with just a thin sheet of khaki head on top. Deep blackness allows no light to penetrate at all. Great roasted nose with a touch of smokiness. I love the subtlety here. This would never be confused with an all out Rauchbier. But there’s a pleasant campfire-like smokiness that is really inviting. Creamy firm mouthfeel. Carbonation level is spot on. Excellent finish. Thinks drinks fantastically. This beer is a bounty of chocolate, roasted malts, smoky bacon. But again, the smoke, though present, isn’t so bold to just wreck this beer ham-style. A pleasant mild smoky finish that lingers just a touch on the palate. I can’t help but gulp this beer. So well-crafted. Another standout brew from the boys at Natty’s.

Adlerbräu Dachsenfranz Adler Pils;Zuzenhausen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dachsenfranz Biermanufaktur Zuzenhausen;A few litres 2018-3 On tap at Essighaus, Heiselberg. - Criminally underrated from exported bottles, - or improved alot since the last review in 2015: this lieblich-but-herb SW Pils shines with lemony Tettnang/Hallertauers on a crisp, golden cereal malt base. Maybe a slight, polished butteriness there in the nose, adding to this excellent regional Pils' lemonade & cereal Lieblichkeit, but not preparing the palate for a natural, crisp, citrus&melissa-rich hop cocktail. Maybe your palate needs to be attuned to the SW-style Pilsner from Rothaus to Waldhaus to Elzach to Engel, to really appreciate the dead-on balance here. -

(Wet Dog Cafe);On tap at Wet Dog Cafe / Astoria Brewing, pours a clear copper with a small beige head. Aroma is strong, with notes of resinous and piney hops, and caramel malts. Flavour is extremely robust and intense, with loads of woody resinous hops and just enough malt to back. Loads of IBUs on this one showing their full colours. Almost too intense - certainly a kick in the face. Excellent, but only for extreme hopheads.
Astoria Bitter Bitch Imperial IPA;Astoria, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Astoria Brewing Co. (Wet Dog Cafe);Thanks for this surprise, jonny! 12oz can.

Pisgah Equinox;Black Mountain, North Carolina, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pisgah Brewing Company;Brickstore hop harvest fest again. Crap not my favorite hop profile here. Band aid and rubbing alcohol. Aroma is a little more muted and tolerable with its earthy herbalness. Flavor is ruinous though and the finish is quick, faint, and citrus bitter, orange.
Pisgah Equinox;Black Mountain, North Carolina, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pisgah Brewing Company;Amber hued with very little head. Smells of piney hops and was highly carbonated. Very little malt background. Mediocre IPA

Pisgah Equinox;Black Mountain, North Carolina, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pisgah Brewing Company;Growler shared by Ding at the Brick Store with the usual crowd. Pours a hazy brownish amber with a big creamy white head that shows good lacing. The aroma is interesting and dominated by the toasted malts with some caramel thrown in. The hops are there in the nose but really just in a supporting role. Definitely not the nose of an APA. The taste follows the aroma and has plenty of caramel malt sweetness and some floral hops that are more prevalent in the bitter finish than up front. The taste has an overall dry and slightly toasted character. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and a bit crisp in the finish. This is not one of my favorite Pisgah brews but it’s certainly drinkable despite not having a ton of complexity. Good but not great.

Durham Dark Secret;Bowburn, Durham, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Durham Brewery;Durham does it again, I don’t know why they have so much beers around, but the house’s signature is in almost all of them. And this was not really dark, was a little more really like orange colour alike.

Pit Bull High Gravity Lager;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Typical 40oz. But not a real horrible high gravity malt liqour. Yellow, bubbly body with a small white head. Stale vegatble aroma. Pretty bad taste. Bland, but not the worst I’ve ever had. Poor, nasty beer.
Pit Bull High Gravity Lager;Utica, New York, United States;Malt Liquor;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;40oz. Golden color, white head, large bubbles. More bland than harsh, yet still plenty of the general nastiness you get from your typical 40. Still some fusels, but like I said it’s pretty bland so it really just lurks in the background. By no means is this well made, it’s just not as rank as the rest.
Durham Silver Chalice;Bowburn, Durham, England;IPA;Durham Brewery;"Bottle conditioned. Pours a relatively pale gold with a decent head; the aroma is heavily fruity with hints of pepper alcohol.

Durham Silver Chalice;Bowburn, Durham, England;IPA;Durham Brewery;Bottle. Loved this stuf.. Quite flowery and hoppy, and quite delicate. Yet quite assertive. Citric rind, grapefruit, and some slightly peppery alcohol. I think this was very good.
Durham Silver Chalice;Bowburn, Durham, England;IPA;Durham Brewery;Cask, Burton Fest 05. Golden in colour with minimal head - light for a barley wine - as the festival notes state. Aromas are grapefruit and sweet pine with spiced oranges. Flavours are sweet, syrupy and viscous. Followed by pine, grapefruit and pepper. Zesty, then mellow with warming but not overbearing alcohol. A well balanced beer.

Ambari (7%);Assolda, Quepem, Goa, India;Pilsener - Imperial;Impala Distillery & Brewery;Shared by Badgerben at Cellars LexLarp. What is this? Pours a yellowish gold with a fuzzy head. Hardly any aroma with a piece of skonk in the background. Taste is sweet malt with a grainy sour mix. Rough finish. What was this?
Ambari (7%);Assolda, Quepem, Goa, India;Pilsener - Imperial;Impala Distillery & Brewery;A strange one, shared by Badgerben. It has a sour aroma and a mildly sour flavor with yeast. It is surely infected, and no doubt the infection has improved it. This is like cheap, dry lambic.
Ambari (7%);Assolda, Quepem, Goa, India;Pilsener - Imperial;Impala Distillery & Brewery;This is interesting... So the yellow color with sour wheat aroma give every indication this is another brewing experiment passed off as a lager, but the taste is actually decent. It’s got to be infected, but the infection worked to its benefit. The sourness and woodiness makes it like a cheap lambic. Actually, not too horrific.
Ambari (7%);Assolda, Quepem, Goa, India;Pilsener - Imperial;Impala Distillery & Brewery;Smells like water with a litle lager stank. Probably infected, but I think it improved the taste. This pottle was nice and sour with some woody characteristics. A cheap lambic as badgerben just commented.

Ambari (7%);Assolda, Quepem, Goa, India;Pilsener - Imperial;Impala Distillery & Brewery;"12 oz bottle from Sitar India in Durham, NC. Thought I’d give it a try, had only heard of Tiger and KingFisher beers from India. Came in a small ""duvel"" shaped botttle and was 7%. Somthing I did not expect. Taste was like a sweet, and mellow malt liquor. Did have some sour notes, but balance was anything but adequate. Expected, but glad I tried."
Ambari (7%);Assolda, Quepem, Goa, India;Pilsener - Imperial;Impala Distillery & Brewery;Looks like a typical pale lager but has an aroma of sweet malt coupled with a strange sourness... but not quite the urine smell detected by the previous rater. The flavor is a slightly bready malt with a honey sweetness and some graininess. Then a slight sourness joins in. (Is there a wild lager yeast?) The finish is a bit metallic with an alcohol dryness. Interesting brew. Binny’s Beverage Depot, Naperville, IL
Ambari (7%);Assolda, Quepem, Goa, India;Pilsener - Imperial;Impala Distillery & Brewery;Very interesting brew....light, light straw color. Pebbly head that dies fast. Nose smells faintly of urine...yes urine. Intense sweetness. The urine isn’t gagging only vaguely similiar. Very bready, doughy yeast. No hops...in fact if there are hops in this beer then I would be amazed. Taste is far better than the aroma. Pungent sweetness. Very exotic round honey flavors. However, the astringent alcohol cuts through quickly and all that is left is a powdery and dry saccharine that won’t go away. Long finish. Palate is thick as tar for a brew this color.
Ambari (7%);Assolda, Quepem, Goa, India;Pilsener - Imperial;Impala Distillery & Brewery;Pours a clear yellow color with a decent white head. Plenty of cheap malt in the aroma. Sort of funky flavor. As clear and refreshing as a lager could be but it finishes with a slightly weird sourness. A hint of alcohol in the flavor as well. Sort of like a cross between Krait and Old English.

Thank you to the DC beer blogger who brought this to the tasting! You rock! Poured nearly jet black with lots of red bubbles flying around but no head. Aroma is incredible: big cherries, sour cherries, oak, dark chocolate truffle, sour grapefruit, very intense spiciness from the whiskey and oak barrel all layered on a massive smoky character, burnt caramel, and rich ganache that blend so well it is hard to describe. Taste is slick, oily, full of spicy whiskey, spicy oak, pepper from the barrel, and lots of sour cherry component. Perfect palate: slick, oily, tart, sour and still full-bodied rather than void. Really an amazing experience.

DC tasting. dark brown, no head, nice golden/tan lace aroma, mild sourness, chocolate malts with a touch of smoke? along with a mild oak barrel. flavors, woot woot, this is just tasty brew. I was hoping some sort of overly bretty beer, instead this is one solid porter. Lots of chocolate malts, mild sourness, dark fruits, elements of soy, light smoke, warming abv. Overall the malt profile just blends perfectly with the brett aspect of this blend. Light oak barrel with some hints of spiciness leaving a prickly palate. Complex and gets better with room temp, letting a lot of the malt profile to come through and add to the wild yeast treatment of Gonzo.

Three Needs Dopplebock;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;12 oz tulip at the brewpub. Dark, dark walnut brown, nearly opaque with blood orange hints, small lasting off-white head decaying to a ring, some lace...big, huge almost, malty nose with lots of caramel-chocolate...toffee more like, and a touch of vanilla...flavor is big and brash also, sweet and candylike but with a light vinous alcoholic note that keeps it from getting to sugary, hints of anise and fig for interest...full body could be even more charming if the alcohol didn’t thin out the creaminess just a bit too much. No ABV listed, I’d say it feels around 9%...whatever it is, delicious and decadent, and 3 Needs’ best in some time. Bravo!
Three Needs Dopplebock;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Pours dark, muggy brown with a thin tan head. Smells of roasted malt and nutty. Tastes of cherries, roasted caramel, toffee, nutty and chewy. Very nice!

Michelob Celebrate Vanilla Oak;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"From Nov 2006 Poured from 24oz bottle(room temp) an amber gold with a small head of foam that shrank to just a fine ring clinging to the edge of the glass. The smell is of vanilla and alcohol. The taste is very strong on the vanilla, perhaps too strong even for a lager that uses vanilla in the name; I can taste no other flavours..oh wait, I'm getting some fruitness now. Sour cherries. Hmm, that helps a bit when it comes to complexity but the alcohol is starting to make its presence known both in the taste and the warming and that's really hurting the drinkability. Still, at least it does have some substance to it so I'm liking it a lot more than the Chocolate Beer that came with it. Bottom line: It's worth a try."

Michelob Celebrate Vanilla Oak;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);05 drank in 09, shoulda held on to this one. I imagine at first it was an over carbonated, oak powered Michelob abortion. 4 years later: smooth oak, vanilla balance with caramel some cherry, very pleasant! Not worth $10+, mine was free, but if it came back out I’d get another one for $6-8

Michelob Celebrate Vanilla Oak;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);2005 bottle. Pours reddish amber with a small white head. Strong bourbon and oak aroma, with some vanilla highlights. Aroma is very enticing. Flavor is toffee, vanilla and fig at first, but is quickly overtaken and dominated by oak, bourbon and alcohol. Thin, watery mouthfeel. Oak lingers for a long finish. The aroma got my hopes up, but ultimately this beer disappointed.
Michelob Celebrate Vanilla Oak;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"Nice amber coloured body with a huge ruby coloured tint. Aroma of strong oak, bad funky malt and strong vanilla. Medium-bodied; Strong bad taste of malt, alcohol, vanilla and vomit. Aftertaste is that bad throw-up flavour with some vanilla, strong sweetness and some malt. Overall, this beer was absolutely horrible. I can’t believe I spent nearly $10 on this piece of crap, but I guess its all worth trying. I sampled this 75 cL bottle purchased from Norm’s in Vienna, Virginia on 04-January-2006."

Weltons Trafalgar 2C;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Weltons Beer;The Sun, RedHill. Orange-amber. Oily hops - which are a bit rough and too prominent for the rather flat and indifferent malt. Sweet things come through, but never quite integrating with the insistent earthy hops. This is not a bad beer, and there are many who would like it, but for me it would need more thought and development - at the moment it simply tastes as though thrown together to see what happens.

Harveys Gunpowder;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;Harveys Brewery;My ratings do not match others and wonder whether the cask was not up to scratch.

Harveys Gunpowder;Lewes, East Sussex, England;Strong Ale - English;Harveys Brewery;Garland, Redhill. Beautiful! Soft radiant fruit - intensely, yet curiously gently sweet. Just enough hops to balance and hold down the malt, giving a barely noticeable, but initially important, bitter finish. Vague hint of vinegar on the nose which could be because the pub have kept this on for too long?

Grapefruits, floral, spices, lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness is fair for an abrupt, mid to low-astringent light Ale malty finish; Slightly dry after taste. Citrus grassy and fairly bitter to mouth. Comments: Thought this one a cheap lager by looking at the 'Sinto Beer' title, in fact it is actually a pretty decent APA. The rice adjunct is hidden so that's good, but the body is curiously sluggish with the malt hollowed. Otherwise the citrus Cascade is neither strong or memorable. Decent enough, but there are better APAs such as the Golden Dragon and Pale Ale from the same brand. Okay to try."

Ise Kadoya Stout;Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan;Stout - Dry;Ise Kadoya;Bottle. Black with a tan head. Aroma is roasty with mocha that’s more dark chocolate than coffee, cream. Medium bodied, mouthfilling enough for me. Smooth with low carbonation but a slightly minerally feel means it’s not silky or creamy.

Hazelnuts, dried fruit and caramel in the flavour. The whole is very sweet with heaviness coming from the alcohol. Very warming, nutty finish. Hard to judge this beer - I’m not a fan of overly heavy, overly sweet and overly alcoholic beers without any noticeable bitterness, on the other hand I feel this is a high quality brew.

Christoffel Bock;Breda, Netherlands;Bock - Doppelbock;Sint Christoffel Bier;Beetje zo op de valreep van het einde van het jaar 2018. Maar dit is echt een fantastisch bock. Die je niet mag missen. Gerookte karamel niet te zoet en niet te bitter en vol van smaak. Eigenlijk heeft het een lekkere volle licht alcoholische kerst kruiden smaak wat je eind het jaar eigenlijk altijd wilt tegen komen. Krenten rozijnen, karamel en meer kortom perfect... totdat ik beter tegen kom. Het enige wat een beetje achterblijft, is de geur. Juist met deze diepe intense smaak zou het mooi zijn als je dit ook meteen in de geur terug vindt. Best een redelijk bruine niet al te aantrekkelijke kleur. Maar goed juist die bezinksels zorgt er voor dat het zo fantastisch smaakt en gezien de smaak Rate ik het dan ook terecht als een topper. Proefglas

Guernsey Sunbeam;St Saviour, Jersey;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Liberation Brewery;Cask, Seymour Inn Grouville. Amber malt, but with a very noticeable and pleasant toffee note, well balanced hop rate makes this a moreish experience, very drinkable if you can find it.
Guernsey Sunbeam;St Saviour, Jersey;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Liberation Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Farmers Arms, St Oeuen, Jersey. Amber beer with light bubbly head. A decent beer at last on Jersey, in a decent pub too. The beer is a little thin but there is a sharp maltiness almost to a point of harshness. There is an underlying fruitiness with a dry, almost lagery note on the finish. All Jersey beers are brewed by Ann Street now and this is one of their better brews.
Guernsey Sunbeam;St Saviour, Jersey;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Liberation Brewery;Cask, Cock and Bottle, St Hellier. Amber with a small off-white foam. Aromas are sweet toffee malts, sulphur and fruit. Flavours are sweet and fruity, toffee malts with a lightly dry finish. Probably over-rated by me, but the venue helped.
Jersey Force 135;St Saviour, Jersey;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Liberation Brewery;Cask, The Peirson, St Hellier. Light golden with a small white head. Aromas are biscuit malts with floral hops - very fresh and citrus - akin to JHB. Flavours are fruity and clean with a light biscuit and butter malt body. Very refeshing. Dry and addictive on the finish with a gentle bitter aftertaste. A great summer beer.
Castle Rock Rook;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Castle Rock Brewery;Cask handpull at Notts BF 05. Dark chestnut, beige head. Odd mix of dark malts. Good dry finish. Don’t know what to make of it. Some good acids. Strange beer.
Castle Rock Rook;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Castle Rock Brewery;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Metally roast beginning, which takes hold insistently. Brown darkness in colour, with a grey foam head. Thin, but long lasting in the mouth. A strange, but rather enjoyable Mild. THIS IS THE 100th MILD. OH YES! >> Oh dear, Chris_o now tells me this is a Bitter... so I’m still stuck on 99 Milds :(
Craftsman Slaters Stout;Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Craftsman (UK);Cask Stillage at the Howcroft Inn, Bolton 15/10/2005. Black with lots of sweetness. Little dryness and roast maltiness in the finish. My first beer from this new brewery which opened just a month earlier.

Wye Valley Ruby Ale;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Wye Valley Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Wellington, Birmingham. Reddish brown with white head. Fuller malty sweetness on the palate moving towards a dryness. Some dry peachiness then an earthy hop note. Pretty reasonable.

Classe Royale Pilsener Bier;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;United Dutch Breweries;Typisch zo'n goedkoop Supermarkt categorie 2 bier, voor weinig krijg je ook weinig. Qua uiterlijk valt het nog mee, maar de smaak en aroma zijn ver te zoeken in dit bier. De volgende dag wel een kater, toch nog waar voor je geld.
Classe Royale Pilsener Bier;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;United Dutch Breweries;Can, 330 ml. I expected something way more worst for 68 €cent, but it's a typical cheap Pilsner type lager. Too sour on the nose, too sweet on the palate, short malty aftertaste, not really interesting, but u can survive a hot day on the beach drinking this. Ah, it has 5% ABV, so u can keep urself hydrated and drunk if u want.

Calumet Conner Johns Scotch Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Draft at Calumet. Hazy orange-brown. Pronounced smoke aroma. Amber malt tones, slightly watery mouthfeel. Soapy hop balance, some underlying butterscotch tones. OK, kind of awkward.
Calumet Conner Johns Scotch Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Pours an amber colour with no head. Again, a slightly watery beer, very light- aroma is of soft subtle oak and perhaps a hint of whiskey, but barely detectable in the taste. Carmel, toffee and green apples in the taste.
Calumet Conner Johns Scotch Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On draught at the brewpub in Chilton, Wisconsin. Pours a dark coppery amber brew with a creamy off-white head that slowly dissolves to a fine film and white ring. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, a touch of candi sugar, flowery hops and some toffee. Taste is medium to full bodied, light carbonation with a good balance of sweet caramel, hop bitterness and alcohol. Finish is where the alcohol come through and I’m guessing around 7.5% abv. The finish aftertaste has a slight mild bitterness that even retains some of the caramel flavor. Though it has a slight bitterness for a Scotch Ale, this is still a pretty decent brew.
Calumet Conner Johns Scotch Ale;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;Dark amber in color. Sweet, roasted flavor . Nice scotch. Don’t know the abv, but seems a little stronger than most of Bob’s brews. Long-lasting finish with a noticeable hop presence.
Rock Bottom Atlanta Festbier;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rock Bottom Atlanta (Craftworks);Draught. Amber color, small head, light malty aroma. Flavor grainy, unbalanced. Has caramel and toffee flavor. Watery finish.
Rock Bottom Atlanta Festbier;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rock Bottom Atlanta (Craftworks);Had on tap at the Rock Bottom in Buckhead (Atlanta), Ga. Medium orange pour, frothy, bone-colored head that leaves sticky lacing. Pleasant, sweet aroma with hints of caramel and toffee. Good Marzen flavor profile with some caramel highlights, a touch of vanilla and a back end of ripening vegetables. Medium thick mouthfeel with a bit of a tinny finish. Overall, decent.
Sixpoint Lady Liberty Pale Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);Draught at brewpub. Strong grapefruit nose with some sweeter malt hints. Cloudy orange with a thin white head. Biting opening of sourness into some bitterness with a dry finish. Not complex, not impressive. Too heavy on the bittering hops with little floral hop character.
Sixpoint Lady Liberty Pale Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);The Lady Liberty was had at the Brewery and poured nice deep amber with a firm head. The aromoas had a deep sense of citrus and called the hops along on the mouthfeel. The palate was complex but yet crisp. It had a well balanced finish!
Sixpoint Lady Liberty Pale Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);Pint served from the conditioning tank on 9/23/06. Very light haziness to this otherwise bright beer, shows the unfiltered nature. A grassy, lemon-honey color to the body, with a very substantial, dense white head that is tremendously well-retained and provides great lacing. This could be proudly served at any CAMRA festival. Soft, lightly citric, juicy hops settle out on the front of the nose, followed by a sweet, comforting honey-like maltiness that slowly allows some light esters (nectarines, pears, red apples) to emerge. Hop crispness and fresh yeast flit about on the finish, not dominant, yet not subtle. Quite playful, really, and very aromatic. I never knew I liked American hops in pale beers this much! Used very artfully, and side-by-side with more traditional hop notes (grass, moss, flowers), they deliver a wonderfully refreshing quality and just a smidgeon of challenging bitterness that would be otherwise lacking. The malt, while fairly basic in complexity, is balanced tremendously well and is very fresh and well-extracted, but not overdone. No alcohol noted in the aroma, of course. The first sip is like a caress on the tongue. Very fine carbonation gently adds zestiness, while a soft blanket of malt sugars tickles the palate all over, providing a perfectly balanced backdrop for a slight tangerine-like tanginess and further evident grassiness, leafiness and all-out hop flavor without the heavy bitterness. Certainly though, it has the appropriate bitterness, helping to cut the honey-like malt presence on the finish, and in concert with the yeast, leaves the palate tingly, refreshed and lightened. Hop zestiness clings on the tongue and makes you take another long draw from the glass immediately. Carbonation is perfect, the beer is flawless, the attenuation near spot-on (I’d prefer it just slightly more dry) and the alcohol not evident and certainly no wateriness/thinning to speak of. As we left this part of the tour, I contemplated hiding in the brewhouse and pulling a chair up to this tank and drinking until I couldnt drink anymore. Ridiculously well-done stuff. Too bad I don’t get to drink more beer fresh off a conditioning tank.
Sixpoint Lady Liberty Pale Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);Had at brewery. Orangey yellow in color with a nice white head. Hoppy and malty aroma. Citrusy hops. Hoppy and malty flavor. Citrus fruity notes. Finish is bitter. Medium bodied. Well balanced. Nice beer. Drinkable.
Sixpoint Lady Liberty Pale Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);Well i guess its about time someone else rated this beer. I believe geographicaly I am the closest to it since its only available on tap at the Liberty Heights tap room (the bar around the brewery). Poured into a pint glass. Color is light yellow/orange with a small head. Cannot see through it but a beautiful radiance is created with the translucence. Aroma is present - all hop however (amarillo?). Taste, again all hop (kind of come to expect this from 6point). A bit of bitterness at the end. Some orange/grapefruit hop taste. Hey for a pale ale (not yet an Americal pale ale) its good. I had this beer after another great brewery tour and it was the first of many this day.
Sixpoint Lady Liberty Pale Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);Fantastic head, standard PA coloring. Big yeasty, mellow English ale aroma. A cigarette-y yeast flavor, pretty dry, some greenish flavors. Greening becomes prominent at the start of the finish. Medium English hopping. Great balance, good stuff.

Raasted Trippel;Randers, Denmark;Tripel;Raasted Bryghus;A murky dark amber ale with a very thin off white head. In aroma, sweet fruity malt with light maple notes, light oxidation, treacle, OK. In mouth, a nice sweet fruity malt with light candy sugar, light oxidation, light curacao and coriander, light alcohol warmth, OK. BB 21-10-09.
Raasted Trippel;Randers, Denmark;Tripel;Raasted Bryghus;A Belgian inspired triple which on closer acquaintance turns out to be a gem that surpasses the Belgian tripels all over. It rises with a great white foam, and the smell is marked by malt, light hop and a fantastic aroma of citrus coriander. The taste is characterized by a pleasant syrupy sweetness that goes over the malt to a discreet hoppy flavor where a touch of orange part. It has a really nice lace and a little taste of alcohol which seems pleasant warming. I strongly recommend that it is poured slowly, as it has many yeast residues at the bottom of the bottle. Without doubt the best Danish triple I’ve ever tasted, and as mentioned before also a triple that actually want to compete with the Belgian.
Raasted Trippel;Randers, Denmark;Tripel;Raasted Bryghus;Bottle thanks to Jesper from Randers Bryghus. From around 2007! Pours a slightly hazy amber with no head what so ever. Aroma is really sweet with syrup, raisins and prunes. Taste is extremely sweet with syruppy dried fruity sweetness. Oily body with no carb. Funny, but not very good.
Hampshire Victorys Home;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hampshire Brewery;Bottled. Amber colour, small beige head.

Hampshire Victorys Home;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hampshire Brewery;Cask at the Swan in the Rushes, Loughborough. Amber colour with slim white head. Very sharp and then sourish taste with a thin mouthfeel. Some background caramel, hoppy finish. Not too bad.
Hampshire Victorys Home;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hampshire Brewery;BCA (from Bottles of Botley, BBE June 06). Seems to be a fairly average toffeish bitter, but the very sharp flavour and thin body seem to indicate an infection. Av rating given.
Stumpys Old Ginger;Upper Swanmore, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stumpys Brewery;bottle at home ... deep golden amber colour ... light fruit and ginger nose ... lovely fruity malt ... rich gingerness ... spoilt by a strong bitterness that very common in ginger beers ... would be great if bitterness could be toned down.
Stumpys Old Ginger;Upper Swanmore, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Stumpys Brewery;BCA (from Bottles of Botley, BBE Mar 06). Some stem ginger aromas and slight citric hops. Fairly malty with nutty undertones and no spicy ginger presence. Rather boring and the initial ginger aroma is rather pointless as it doesnt add anything to the beer.

Franconia Notch Braggot;Littleton, New Hampshire, United States;Mead;Franconia Notch Brewing Co.;I enter these things in, and only having had a sample, I don’t rate it at the time, hoping I will make it to the brewery for a larger sample. But, sadly, FN is out of business and I still don’t see any plans/talk of them starting up again soon (their landlord sold the property the brewery was on). So I may as well rate it, rather than delete the entry. Had it from a large swingtop bottle at the Linwood Grill beer tasting event in August 2005 Corn-maize yellow, deep golden and bronze highlights with a bubbly, off-white head that quickly recedes to ring. Clarity is medium to medium-high, but the beer is definitely unfiltered. Sweet honey combines with light apple fruitiness to produce a strong start to the nose. Waves of vanilla hit, followed by a grainy, toasty maltiness that adds more fullness to the otherwise mead-like aroma. Light caramel notes linger, but it ends with a soft vanilla-honey note with light phenolics and a touch of breadiness. Alcohol is well-concealed. Carbonation is higher than expected, accentuating the barley notes which are more dry, lightly toasty and with a pinch of sweet buttertoffee. Honey sticks to the palate, showing a medium attenuation and lack of syrupiness. I remember a distinct, almost borderline smokiness, but probably more just a dry, grainy, medium-malt toastiness in actuality. Some minerals, moderate fruitiness and phenolics from the honey sit on the finish. Bubbly carbonation with a touch of thinning on the end.

Fitgers Daisy Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;Part of a sampler with lunch on the way to haul our sailboat. Nice, sharp, bitter brew with a lot of grass and young grapefruit. Very dry, with a goodly hint of seaweed. Quite enjoyable.
Fitgers Daisy Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;#11. A very dark amber, nearly brown color with a thin head. Very floral aroma, kind of like Noble hops, but honestly more just like a stroll in a garden with a hint of green tea. Light malt flavor, burried under a ton of hoppy acidic bitterness. A bit of a floral taste. Interesting and unexpected.
Fitgers Daisy Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;Pours an amber brown with medium cream-colored head. Aroma is hops and caramel. Flavor is definite notes of hops with a mild caramel undertone. (I didn’t tell WisconsinBeer this was an IPA...merely that it had definite hops). The hops are citrusy. Interesting Amber.
Fitgers Daisy Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;"Growler. Brownish red color, medium head. Decent amount of lacing. Flavor is mild caramel malt with an assertive hop finish. GF picked up a growler of this, she told me it was and IPA, I believed her. That’s how much hop presence this ""amber ale"" has. Medium bodied, mild carbonation. Sweet lingering finish. Solid for the style."
Fitgers Daisy Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;Sampled on draught as Daisy Ale #9 at the Fitger’s Brewhouse in Duluth, MN. Pours a clear reddish/copper amber brew with a creamy light tan head that has good retention and lacing. Aroma of roasted caramel malt, some roasted nuts, green tea, and some floral/citrus hops. Taste is medium bodied, lightly carbonated with a good balance of caramel malt with some flowery hop character. Finish is slightly dry, a little metalic with a lingering mild bitter aftertaste.
Fitgers Daisy Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;This is Daisy VI. Pours a nice clear ruby amber color. Beautiful. A two inch thick layer of the softest foam I have ever experienced, almost a tan color. Nice lacing throughout the pint. Initial aroma of hops (when I opened the growler), subsequent aroma mildly malty. This starts out as a malty beer, with caramel, a mild toasted malt, and some burnt toffee. Then the citrus/pine hop bitterness kicks in for a nice balance and great flavor. A little citrus, a little pine, and a lot of bitterness in the aftertaste. Medium body and very tasty.
Fitgers Daisy Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;"On Tap in Shaker. Light brown-amber colour with a sizable creamy white head with good lacing. Scent is subdued; smooth and inviting with strong tea elements. Taste was creamy and light/smooth bodied with strong tea elements intermixed with a nice balance of mild grain and hops. Interesting earthy flavour on the palate as it goes down."

Ruby orange brown, burnt-sienna pour, with a finger of superfine ivory head. Dried apricot and craisins aroma, backed with a quick dose of Cascade hops. Crystalline. Flavor is a mellow fruit, again kicked with hops on the back. Tangy, with a touch of floral and a dose of grapefruit and lime cologne. Good warm bitter nose. Finish hop dry and yet savory smooth. Solid, with no faults and a nice level of intricacy. Clinging hops sugars and sunflower seeds on the finish. Earlier Rating: 10/23/2005 Total Score: 3.1 Slightly murky orange fringed brown, with a thick bubbly tan holding cream head. Light chlorine aroma, a tinge of lime and some rum. A very light and thin beer, but well balanced on the low end of the spectrum. Sharp floral, yet fleeting hops and a sultry smooth brown sugar malt. Less distinguish that straight Daisy or Double. A much reduced hop profile. Watery for the style and 6.5%

Pours crystal clear deep golden/amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big honey, brown sugar, brown bread dough, and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of caramel, nuttiness, wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of bready malts and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with big strength. Taste of big honey, brown sugar, brown bread dough, and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of caramel, nuttiness, wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of honey, brown sugar, brown bread dough, toasted biscuit, caramel, nuttiness, wood, peppercorn, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of bready malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 5.5%. Overall this is an awesome Marzen. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of bready malts and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish; awesome soft feel. Awesome clean/rich Pils/Munich malt showcase, with great noble hop presence/balance for the style. Light residual sweetness with lingering dryness. A really enjoyable offering, and outstandingly spot on style example. One of the best new Oktoberfests I've had in a while."

Arbor Oktoberfest;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;This year, it’s a bit cloudy brownish-red. I’m not an expert on the style, but this was certainly the roughest example I’ve tasted. Had a strong maltiness, and the expected bready quality, but there was certainly some sourness and heat to go along with it. This beer looked strong, tasted strong, and felt strong. I’ll be disappointed if it’s not actually strong. Bottom-line: Unrefined albeit Tasty.
Arbor Oktoberfest;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;"Tap; I wonder why this wasn’t avaliable to rate when the beer was actually being served....anyhow. Red, burnt orange in appearance, decent head which faded, nice lacing I remember. Malty, nutty, spicy, hoppy and candied nose. Mouthfeel was satisfying, in which it started with the hop attack, slightly dry, sweet, then bitter. All balanced fairly well. A well done oktober oktober."

Cisco Pumple Drumkin;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Pours an amber from a bottle, aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg, flavor is similar, dry, a little cloyingly spicy. Okay beer.
Cisco Pumple Drumkin;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);dessert beer. sour tartness with nutmeg honey oats and pumpkin pie. true sipper I could appreciate for the flavor but couldnt finish more than half of one. I dont know why some here say too watery and not too sweet. I got the opposite?
Cisco Pumple Drumkin;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Average light brown appearance, fairly decent head. Autumn spices on the aroma.. with nice balance. Taste is very good, not much on the spice...like a very drinkable session with some character. I like it.
Cisco Pumple Drumkin;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Clear amber pour with a slightly garnet cast. Normal head volume, lacing and retention. Light nose of pumpkin and spice. Lighter than typical in intensity. Light body slightly smoother than water. Below normal carbonation level with a hint of effervescence in the middle and a somewhat stronger finish. The flavor profile is rather good. It is flavorful, not very complex and well balanced. It begins with a blend of spices that never really separate. The middle shows a bit of pumpkin and no hop flavor. As the finish fades, pumpkin makes its strongest showing and a bit of hop bitterness surfaces.
Cisco Pumple Drumkin;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Draft at The Pour House in Westmont, NJ. Pours a very dark ruby red/copper color with dark orange edges and a half finger off-white head that immediately dissapears. No lacing. Sweet pumpkin pie aroma with zesty autumnal spices and vanilla. Pumpkin purée along with cinnamon, brown sugar, clove and nutmeg. There’s a subtle vegetal quality but it smells more dessert like than anything. Medium bodies with a strong zesty spicy presence up front that lingers over the sweet pumpkin notes into a dry finish. Slightly more vegetal than expected but still sweet with prominent autumnal spice. Not as dessert like with lots of clove, pepper and allspice followed by pumpkin purée, nutmeg and bready malt. ABV is well masked with no alcoholic heat making it decently drinkable. Could be a touch sweeter but it’s not a bad interpretation of the style.
Cisco Pumple Drumkin;Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Cisco Brewers Nantucket (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);8th of 12 in round 1 of 2015 Pumpkin beer tasting. Very watery. 11/12 from all tasters.

Aromas are very fruity for a mild, earthy with soft milk chocolate and berries. Flavours are light chocolate and roast malts with lots more berry fruitiness. Smooth on the palate. Not bad.

Aromas are grain, citrus and some sweetness. Hops spices, too. Flavours are reminisent of the aromas but drier and with pine and pepper on the finish. So many Glentworths, so much familiarity - having said that, its OK.
ABK Premium Lager Hell Anno 1518;Kaufbeuren, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Aktienbrauerei Kaufbeuren;corn a bit of liquid flowery in honey and hemp. the flavors are light. the beer is slightly extra in its effervescence. almost moderate in body the alcohol keeps it back.
ABK Premium Lager Hell Anno 1518;Kaufbeuren, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Aktienbrauerei Kaufbeuren;Pours a golden yellow with a corn malt aroma. Taste is lightly sweet, with a corn flavor. A crisp light beer that left a bubbly carbonated aftertaste.

ABK Premium Lager Hell Anno 1518;Kaufbeuren, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Aktienbrauerei Kaufbeuren;"Bügelverschlußflasche (thanx to joss):Pale golden, small white fluffy head, visible carbonation; sweet-grainy and bitter-hoppy nose; light sweet-bitter flavour, rather lightbodied; sweetish finish, a bit tart and bitter in the aftertaste. O.K., drinkable....."
ABK Premium Lager Hell Anno 1518;Kaufbeuren, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Aktienbrauerei Kaufbeuren;Bottle Dry herbal bittering hop and chewy malt aroma. Pale golden, foamy head. Rather lightbodied, malt definetely falls into the background, however there is a rather nice floral and herbal hop profile in the foreground. Weak and flat finish, light floral aftertaste. Unusual offering from a bavarian brewer I think - has its merrits on a hot day.
Big Horse 5 Mile Mild;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Mild Ale;Big Horse Brewing;Tap at brewery. Medium brown color, fairly clear. Very nice off-white head forms, retains and leaves great lacing. Light bodied with adequate carbonation. Aroma is lightly toasty with a slight earthy hop presence. Flavor runs the same direction, probably much more hop presence than in nose. A touch more malt would have been nice. Fair.
Oregon Trail Black Wito;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Porter;Oregon Trail Brewery;Pours dark cola with a tan head. Sour mash aroma. Flavor is sour cherry, bourbon/vanilla, and chocolate. There’s a zest hint. Might be the wit. Quite tasty.
Oregon Trail Black Wito;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Porter;Oregon Trail Brewery;on tap-pours a light brown head and dark brown color with red tint. Aroma is dark fruit, bourbon, medium malt. Taste is dark fruit, bourbon, medium malt, chardonnay? Interesting.
Oregon Trail Black Wito;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Porter;Oregon Trail Brewery;Probably the most exciting experimental beer I have had in a very long time and all because of a bad batch of beer. A cross between a flemish sour ale and a bourbon porter. The nose has that rancid sourness like a lambic but still has some nice spice and fruit, with a carbonated zesty mouthfeel.
Oregon Trail Black Wito;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Porter;Oregon Trail Brewery;Sampled at the brewery. Had a unique and very WEIRD flavor and texture - both from the witbier used (read my rating) and from the infected early batch of the bourbon porter. Had some brett qualities in an Orval-way... a bit creamy and zesty, active and carbonated and acidic as well. Very interesting brew that was tasty, but I think only in rather small amounts.
Oregon Trail Black Wito;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Porter;Oregon Trail Brewery;This was a great experimental beer. The Black Wito started off as a bourbon aged porter that sat too lomng and so there where adjuncts added to make this a good beer. Blackberry, and wit beer where added along with some brown ale. This was a highly unique beer. Need to try to understand.

Calwer Eck Keller-Pils;Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauhaus Calwer-Eck Stuttgart;Beer in the glass zippy, small head, not very turbid. Starts dry, quite hoppy, a bit sourish with fruity lemon notes.
Calwer Eck Keller-Pils;Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauhaus Calwer-Eck Stuttgart;500ml bottle. Aroma is light hopy and oat. Appearance is light cloudy yellow with a small head. Taste is sweet and bitter. Leaves a good dry mouth feel. Overall a nice Pilsner.
Calwer Eck Keller-Pils;Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauhaus Calwer-Eck Stuttgart;Würziger und frisch getreidig-herber Antrunk. Im Mittelteil steht die Getreidigkeit vorerst alleine da, dies ist aber keinesfalls negativ! Die vorwiegend herbe, daneben aber auch erkennbar hopfige Note kehrt anschließend zurück, zuletzt ist es die kräftigere Würzigkeit, die sich in den Vordergrund stellt. Dies ist nur vorn kurzer Dauer, die Getreidigkeit, die auf gleicher Intensität bleibt, ist daher im Abgang wieder führend. Weiter hopfig, hierbei ist eine leichte Süße angenehm und lässt die folgende Bitternote sanfter erscheinen. Vollmundig, frisch, spritzig und dabei ausreichend herb. Ein rundum gelungenes Pils! Test vom 18.3.2008, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 11,13,12,13,12,13 - 12,60
Calwer Eck Keller-Pils;Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauhaus Calwer-Eck Stuttgart;Cloudy Pils with a quick forming head. Very clear golden appearance. A bit sour and quite sharp.

Bartrams Grozet;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bartrams;Bottle.Gold with a small head,aroma is of light hops and fruit,taste is tarty and earthy with light malt and fruit.
Bartrams Grozet;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bartrams;Gravicask (CWAF2013, Thurs) Gold, loose head. Light and grainy aroma, refreshing and crisp. Taste is also very grainy, but not too sweet. Very refreshing brew, could session this easily. Gooseberries not really playing much of a role here, but probably are part of what keeps it so light and refreshing.
Bartrams Grozet;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bartrams;Bottle from boamr. Pours a gold color, white head. I grew up eating something related to the gooseberry, so this beer reminded me of childhood. Don’t get me wrong, its not that good...but it reminds me of home. Enough said. Berry flavor, wheat and malt flavors. A bit of odd bitterness too.
Bartrams Grozet;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bartrams;thanks ronsup very lite berry flavors nice haead bu not as nice as i thought it would be
Bartrams Grozet;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bartrams;Bottle. Very bitter with a full head. The taste hits you with its slightly fruity bitterness.Different but not really that nice.
Bartrams Grozet;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bartrams;Average overall, not to bad, fairly inexpensive, but so is the taste. Kind of sour and foggy.
Bartrams Grozet;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bartrams;golden coloured ale, with a citrusy fruit nose, a hoppy ipa like beer with a sweet drying finsh
Bartrams Grozet;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bartrams;Bottle conditioned, from Beer Cellar in Lincoln. Gold, good lasting rocky white head and gentle condition. Very low citrus and vegetable aromas in the nose with a developing phenolic infection in the background, quite dry and earthy in the mouth with a touch of sweet yeastiness but again in the background is a niggling suggestion of infection. Short bitter phenolic finish.
Bartrams Pierrôt;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bartrams;Cask conditioned handpump Wig & Pen Northampton. A golden beer with a whitish head. The aroma has lots of hay. A bit milky in the mouth. On the odd side. Chalky. Hmm?
Bartrams Pierrôt;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bartrams;Cask (Cambridge Blue, Cambridge) 4 Mashy cheesy porridge. Dishclothy. 3 Typical pale bitter. 5 Peas and pulses. Organic-ish, but gone wrong. 3- Watery. Some hops in the finish are OK, I guess. 11 Tired. Dull too.
Bartrams Pierrôt;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bartrams;Bottle conditioned, from Beer Cellar in Lincoln. Gold, moderate fluffy white head and gentle condition. Low citrus and herbal hop notes with a touch of yeastiness in the nose, sweet and nutty in the mouth but with an overpowering yeast bite. Finish is dry, yeasty and unpleasantly bitter.
Redoak Weizen Doppelbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Weizenbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Draught as part of a paddle at Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe, Sydney, on October 13, 2015. Listed at 9.0% ABV. Rich, smooth, sweet, vinous, dates, port wine, some scotch whisky, bourbon taste. Sweet, alcohol, port wine aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel, low bitterness. Clear, dark deep reddish brown color, white to off-white head. Sweet, alcohol, vinous, malty, light of raisin scent.
Redoak Weizen Doppelbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Weizenbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Pours a dark cloudy brown with an off-white head. Aroma is malt, wheat, banana, yeast, caramel and some vanilla. Taste is medium to high sweet leading to a smoothly malty yeasty finish. Very good.
Redoak Weizen Doppelbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Weizenbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;A new batch apparently - 9% - beautiful - bananas waft from the glass - cant taste the alcohol at all - sweet caramel - esters dominate. Very interesting and full of flavour. Good one.
Redoak Weizen Doppelbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Weizenbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;bottled, at the brewpub. reddish brown with a lasting head. aroma of plum, whiteboard markers and burnt banana. sweet wheaty character, hints of vanilla and cherry tomato, light texture, faintly metallic finish. a little messy but still pleasant
Redoak Weizen Doppelbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Weizenbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Bottle. Quite estery, with some clovey banana characters, mixed with a caramel sweetness and some alcoholic warmth. Also got a slight green apple character. Not as chocolatey or complex as something like Aventinus, but still well made, and nicely tasty. Wish it wasn’t so expensive, coz then i may have thought about having another one.
Redoak Weizen Doppelbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Weizenbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;a decent stab at an aventinus imitation. the irony is that you can buy 500ml of aventinus for $6 whereas 330ml of this will cost $12. that is exactly three times the cost. but i am being a bit disingenuous cause that’s the over the counter price. still, when you have the option of staying home and drinking aventinus or going to redoak, listening to the bad easy listening house music and drinking this stuff, i know what i’ll do in future. right the details: hazy red brown, served far too cold to even get any sort of lasting head. low carbonation - way too low for the style. raisiny, alcoholic aroma with a stack of black banana, some clove, and a bit of brandy. flavour has quality malt - bready, biscuitty and warm - and an immediate shot of alcohol. the aftertaste fades away with banana, fusels, and a slight note of boiled brussels sprouts. finishes too sweet - could be spicier. this sweetness isn’t helped by the low carbonation. still, a good effort, and good on em for brewing it.
Redoak Weizen Doppelbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Weizenbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Vibrant cloudy dark orange in the glass - looks very tasty. Massive head takes 10 minutes to settle. Rich nose, fruity, Belgium-esque. More fruit and rich malts in the mouth with a slightly hard liquered feel. Tails off a touch but still a beer with plenty of power.
Redoak Weizen Doppelbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Weizenbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;After bombing out with the pale ale first this day I was looking forward to tasting this, their latest seasonal offering. It came delivered to me as though I was in a cafe, on a tray and with a milk chocolate colour and a thick creamy tan head. I immediately clasped my hands firmly round the glass to happily donate some of my 38 degrees C in order to realise the brew’s potential. It proved worthwhile, as I relished in the bananas and creamy caramel aromas that wafted up, although I also detected a bit of meatiness (maybe it was the vegemite that I see highlandlad found). Slid down the gullet smoothly, with a balance slightly on the bitter side giving it a good bite. There was a bit of an alcohol tang (or was it a burn?), but I suppose at 8.4% it should be fighting back somewhat. Expected a little more body in this too, as it didn’t quite provide much of an aftertaste. I’d definitely have this again, though, if there weren’t so many others to get through first!!
Redoak Weizen Doppelbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Weizenbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;I think this one is actually a Weizenbock rather than Doppelbock, even though the name obviously says it is. When I saw it poured, let it settle and had another the words Schneider Aventinus came to mind. There is a definite estery base here which distinguishes this as a weizen with a fine smack of fruity tang in the mouth. The high ABV is obvious as is the blend of barley and wheat malts. This place contnues to impress with another very fine representation of a foreign style of beer that is not brewed on these shores. Following the other high octane beers in the Belgian Tripel and Baltic Porter this establishment continues to go from strength to strength.
Redoak Weizen Doppelbock;Sydney, Australia;Bock - Weizenbock;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Caveat: had to rush this one and couldn’t give it enough time to warm. Pity because I suspect it would have developed a bit more characater. As it was it struck me as a typically well-made example of the style, if a little one-dimensional at the standard Redoak serving temperature. Looked great in the tall glass - muddy brown, with a head that lasted to the foot of the glass. The aroma reminded me of one of Scotland’s rare contributions to international cuisine: Banoffee Pie. Toffee, bananas and cream, with the beer also showing a spicy clove note. It’s full in the body and quite creamy-lactic at the back of the throat. On the tongue, it showed lots of toffee, some restrained banana and clove. It has the same Vegemite bite in the finish as the Baltic Porter. House yeast? Quite distinctive. Overall, a solid bock. (BTW, I was briefly disgruntled at paying $8 for a 250ml glass until I went to the next pub and paid $7.50 for a skunky bottle of Cascade Lager. The joy of Sydney CBD drinking...) (Tap at brewpub)
Ringneck Hop Pillow Dry Hopped Pils;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;The Brew Kettle;"Bought a bottle on my way out, 12/2005. Bright clear and golden, nice big head and great lacing - very enticing. Grassy, hoppy aroma. Taste was very smooth with a hint of grainyness, bready malts but not strong; the super dry pepper floral hoppy finish really did it for me - excellent hop usage here. Note to self - get more for Spring and Summer!"
Ringneck Hop Pillow Dry Hopped Pils;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;The Brew Kettle;Sample at the brewpub. Clear, shiny gold with a touch of head and lasting lacing...fresh, dry grassy nose with light sweet lavender hints...body fairly dry though honey is mutedly present, grainy and earthier as it warms, fairly dry and bitter at the finish....really quite dry, needs a bit more malt presence I think.
Ringneck Hop Pillow Dry Hopped Pils;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;The Brew Kettle;22 oz bottle: Deep golden body w/a lasting white pillowy head. Grassy and floral hop aromas, more grassy when chilled, more floral when warmed. Hints of grainy malt muted by floral hop as it warms. Ever so slight hints of DMS actually add to a bit of complexity. Clean otherwise. Well balanced, w/a bit of grainy malt and herbal hop flavor. Clean taste, no fruitiness. A bit of sweetness up front but finishes with an ever so slight hop bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste. Lighter body but not watery, smooth at first but a dry m/f finish, w/ a medium carbonation. Actually a pretty darn good lighter style as they go. I would liken this to an American Premium on hops. Too sweet for a German Style, but too bitter for an American Premium. Good beer to get the macro swilling people on the right track!
Michigan Brewing Screamin Pumpkin Spiced Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Michigan Brewing Company;bottle. november 2011. orange with small head. really nice fall spice. not overdone, perfect amount. if all the MBC beers were this good, they’d still be in business. sadly, only this and the IPA were any good.
Michigan Brewing Screamin Pumpkin Spiced Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Michigan Brewing Company;A - Pours a cloudy orange-amber color with a big finger of frothy off-white head. The head fades down very slowly leaving behind some nice lace. S - Aroma is a mix of brown sugar and pumpkin pie spices with nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves, with some caramel and bready malts and some pumpkin. T - Starts off with some sweet caramel malts with some pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices including some nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. Through the middle, some brown sugar comes through with some more spices and pumpkin flavor. The finish is a mix of spices, bready malts, pumpkin, and some spices. M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with spicy and slightly sweet finish. D - Very drinkable. Really nice pumpkin and with a good balance of pumpkin flavor and spices.
Michigan Brewing Screamin Pumpkin Spiced Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Michigan Brewing Company;27/III/2012 - 355ml bottle @ home - BB: n/a (2012-292) Thanks to Cory and kelly for the bottle! Little cloudy deep orange beer, big irregular creamy head, adhesive, pretty stable. Aroma: lots of cloves, cinnamon, some ginger, more cloves, bit sugary, although that last could be my mind playing tricks on me with all of these pastry aromas. MF: soft carbon, light to medium body. Taste: lots of spices, mainly cinnamon and cloves, orange peel, gingerbread. Aftertaste: bitter, lots of spices, more cloves and cinnamon, bitter, little metallic, green banana.
Michigan Brewing Screamin Pumpkin Spiced Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Michigan Brewing Company;Bottle: Poured an orangey color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of cinnamon and cloves is quite strong with light pumpkin notes. Taste is also a nice mix between some strong notes of cinnamon and cloves with light pumpkin and some semi-sweet caramelized malt. Body is average with good carbonation. Well brewed with just about right amount of spices.
Michigan Brewing Screamin Pumpkin Spiced Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Michigan Brewing Company;From notes. First reviewed 9/3/2011. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Screamin Pumpkin pours a translucent light caramel color with a foamy off-white that shows good retention and leaves a bit of lace on the glass. The aroma is very good. Lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, and all spice combine with the pumpkin to give a nice pumpkin-forward aroma. Lightly sweet malt in the background. The malt comes in a bit too soft. Slightly sweet but lacking enough punch, the pumpkin really dominates the flavor along with the spices. Cinnamon mostly, but a bit of nutmeg and all spice contribute to the pumpkin pie flavor. The end has an astringent grassy bitterness that is fairly off-putting. The finish is a little bit bitter. The body is a little bit light for what I would like given the flavor profile. The malt really does not hold up to the strong pumpkin and spices. The carbonation kind of gets lost. It starts light sweet and sticky, but by the end there is a light astringency. The aroma is by far the best part about this beer. The taste is a little bit off to me with the lack of balance between the malt and pumpkin and also the astringent bitterness that comes in at the end. There are better pumpkin beers out there.
Black Bear Gearhead Ale;Orono, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Bear Brewing Company;"(Tap) bright clear Amber colour with a small beige head; aroma of stewed fruit; dryish, mineral flavour with a long, light bitter finish"
Black Bear Gearhead Ale;Orono, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Bear Brewing Company;Reviewed from old notes. On tap at their brewpub. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a fairly hazy dark red color with a bar pour’s kind of slim film of a white head. Barely any lacing was left. The smell had a dark caramel malty richness about the aroma. The taste had a rich English maltiness, slightly caramel and slightly chocolatey. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with not much of a sessionability about it. The carbonation seemed okay for the style and for me. It left a slightly smooth creaminess rolling over my tongue. Overall, honestly, this was just an okay amber ale, nothing special.
Town Hall Petunias Pumpkin Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Draught at the Town Hall Brewery, Minneapolis, MN. Slightly cloudy golden color with a small off-white head. Pumpkin, spices and sugary sweetness in the aroma. Pumpkin, spices and sugar in the flavor. I hate pumpkins, I don’t like spices in my beer and sweetness in the beer makes me sick. Why would I like this brew?
Town Hall Petunias Pumpkin Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Keg @ Town Hall. Amber pour with a tiny white head. Pretty spicy nose. Cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, vanilla and banana. Taste is more spicy than sweet. Dry pepper with a bit of chewy caramel at the end. Medium body, soft carb.
Town Hall Petunias Pumpkin Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Sampled from the tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear orange with an amber hue and a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has notes of sweet grain and pumpkin with a pretty strong spice backbone. Flavor starts with light grains and pumpkin but finish is full of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.
Town Hall Petunias Pumpkin Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Really great pumpkin aroma on this guy. Pumpkin is definitely there, so it isn’t a spice bomb, but the spice plays nicely. not super complex after the initial spice/vanilla/pumpkin hit, but definitely a new fall favorite
Town Hall Petunias Pumpkin Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;November 25, 2013 - on tap at Town Hall Lanes. Clear dark orange pour with limited head. Aroma and taste that were as you would expect with a pumpkin beer. The spice wasn’t too much, but was close to crossing the line for me.
Town Hall Petunias Pumpkin Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tap. Dark amber. Little head and lacing . Smells of sweet spice, but taste carries the spice flavor well. More syrupy than what I like, and doesn’t have the perfect mouthfeel. But a solid pumpkin beer.
Town Hall Petunias Pumpkin Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tap at Town Hall Lanes. Clear deep orange pour with a small but persistent white head. Pumpkin, vanilla, and mild spice aroma. Smooth palate. Fairly sweet taste - nice pumpkin character. This is nice.
Town Hall Petunias Pumpkin Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Potent pumpkin pie and spice scent, pours dark amber on color. Has a pleasant spice taste, one of my favorite pumpkin brews!
Town Hall Petunias Pumpkin Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Serving glass: Poured from tap into Pint glass. Appearance: Clear amber-orange with thin head and not much lacing. Aroma: Smells like sweet, creamy pumpkin pie with a hefty dose of spices. Taste: Pretty sweet and creamy pumpkin pie mostly. Cinnamon accompanies the sweet taste, while some pretty strong, more bitter spices (clove?, nutmeg?) provide some counterbalance. Despite the sweetness, there may be some dry caramel malts providing backbone. Palate: Very creamy and smooth for the low abv. Moderate carbonation with semi-dry finish, simply due to the spices. Overall: Did not know that liquid pumpkin pie could be accomplished at the ~5% abv level. Impressive, although it is a titch to sweet for mass consumption.
Town Hall Petunias Pumpkin Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Sample at Town Hall on 10/29/10. Clear orange pour with a thin off-white head. Aroma of cinnamon and ginger with a hint of vanilla. Flavor is also cinnamon, ginger and vanilla. Tastes like Libby’s pumpkin pie mix in a glass. Tasty.
Yankee Jim Honey Lager;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Hole Brewing Company;This beer is clear with an orangy-gold base. The head is white, generous, but gone right before your eyes. The aroma.........grass. No hops, no honey. The flavour is more grass without a hint of hops or honey. Not a very good beer.
Yankee Jim Honey Lager;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Hole Brewing Company;473ml can. Moderate white head with low retention. Clear copper colour. Nose of hops and honey. Flat taste with a hint of honey. Boring.
Yankee Jim Honey Lager;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Hole Brewing Company;Originally rated November 2005. My last of the Yankee Jim series (unless they create another one). Pours a golden-amber colour with an off-white foamy head. Quickly dissipates, but some light lacing is left. Crazy carbonation at first, then becomes a flat watery mouthfeel. The nose is grainy in malt with touches of honey and something kind of gross and weird (like rust). The taste is not too sweet, starting with some bitterness and malt, finishing on a grainy note. The honey calms down the bitterness and is amplified in the aftertaste, way later. Not a bad swill and easy going.
Black Bear Pirate Bear;Orono, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Bear Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy pale to burnt rounded orange color. The head was slim to none with barely any lacing around the glass. The smell had some burnt caramel malts to combine with a burnt hoppiness. There was a light cracker - like substance there as well. The taste was moderately cracker sweet with a substantial amount of weird burnt caramel malts to it. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat subdued and came across as bland over my tongue. Something definitely didn’t sit right. Overall, I didn’t really dig this one.
Black Bear Pirate Bear;Orono, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Bear Brewing Company;Draft in Bar Harbor. Not the best. Pours dark yellow with white head. Nose is grainy. Taste is mild.
Black Bear Pirate Bear;Orono, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Bear Brewing Company;On tap at Finback during a bar crawl through Bar Harbor with my wife. Pours a clear gold with a thin to medium sized white head. Soft malt, sweet grain, very faint hops. Sweet caramel, sweet and fruity. Rather sweet, bitter. Grain and malt, earthy. Mediocre, not a lot going on.
Black Bear Pirate Bear;Orono, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Bear Brewing Company;On tap at the Water Street Tavern. Pours an amber color with a thin white head. Aroma is minimal. Mouthfeel is a bit watery. Mild malt with a bit of a hop bite. It seems as though this beer is not sure what it wants to be. Seems a bit light even for a pale ale but it is easy to drink.
Black Bear Pirate Bear;Orono, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Bear Brewing Company;Draft at Blaze in Bar Harbor. Beautiful bronze appeal, but drinks with a very light character ... both in body and flavor profile. Quality APA characteristics lurk here, but only in an unassertive manner. (#4218, 8/21/2011)
Black Bear Pirate Bear;Orono, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Bear Brewing Company;On tap at the Finback Alehouse in Bar Harbor. Amber color with a decent loamy head, courtesy of the tap. A nice hop aroma balanced with some caramel malt. Flavors have a nice hop bite that pushes it into the category of a quality American pale ale. Very enjoyable.
Black Bear Pirate Bear;Orono, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Bear Brewing Company;on tap-pours an off white head and cloudy orange color. Aroma is citrus/pine, some medium malt. Taste is pine/herbal/earthy hops with some bitterness, secondary medium malt with some sweetness. Grainy mouth feel, medium body. OK, maybe there’s a house yeast as there’s a common theme with the first beer.
Black Bear Pirate Bear;Orono, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Bear Brewing Company;I guess people don’t like this beer...Well, I was pleasantly surprised, although I have to say that the only reason I drank this bomber last night was because the cap came off in the car and it leaked beer! It has some of the most foam I’ve ever had in a beer, especially from a Pale Ale. It was quite tasty overall - amnd quite drinkable once the head subsided. It had a full body of hops, which made it bright, crisp and refreshingly bitter, yet it was heavy and filling, which was excellent, since I was a.) hungry and b.) needed to get to sleep fast. So it worked.
Black Bear Pirate Bear;Orono, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Bear Brewing Company;OUCH!!. is all I can say. This beer smelled sour - then tasted sour. It was one of the worst beers I’ve ever had. I still chocked down the entire 22 oz. - I’m a trooper, beer is a terrible thing to waste
Black Bear Pirate Bear;Orono, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Black Bear Brewing Company;"22oz bottle, from mug. Crystal clear, light copper body with a beautiful white head. Aroma is pretty bland; mostly cereal, with a faint resinous note. Medium bodied, with a lightly oily texture and lively but not overbearing carbonation. Flavors really are well-balanced as they claim. Finish is bitter, but sort of tangy."
Yardy Lager Beer;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big City Brewing Company;12 oz. clear glass bottle. Pours a slightly hazy gold with a thin-moderate white head that quickly dissipated to an uneven film and left no lace. Some mild skunkiness in the aroma when I first poured the beer. This thankfully disappeared after a minute or so. The aroma is excessively sweet smelling in a rotten fruit kind of way. The flavor is very malty with corn syrup sweetness. Lightly bitter at the finish. Thin, watery mouthfeel. Not very good.
Yardy Lager Beer;Kingston, Jamaica;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big City Brewing Company;Tried at NYC’s BrewTopia fest in Nov, 2005. Apparently it’s now being imported by MBD/American Beverage Distributors. A typical international lager in the mold of Quisqueya (which is another international lager they import). Unremarkably watery, but lacking hops makes it very mild and drinkable for the BMC (BudMillerCoors) crowd.
Fox Barrel Hard Cider;Colfax, California, United States;Apple Cider;Fox Barrel Cider Company;"since the description mentions it, Fox Barrel is a good foodie drink. not the first thing i’d reach for in winter, or by itself, but there’s a decent crisp apple aroma and flavor here. not bad, though i prefer the pear."""
Fox Barrel Hard Cider;Colfax, California, United States;Apple Cider;Fox Barrel Cider Company;We had this beer at the 2013 Tops of the Hops in Biloxi, MS. Sweet and good, much like Woodchuck, Hornsby, or other ciders. Not a lot of that sour apple taste.
Fort Street Double Scotch;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fort Street Brewery;cask: scotch ale with butterscotch snapps. Slightly murky amber with minimal white head. Aroma somewhat muted, sweet buttery malt. Flavor is all sweet malted caramel with butter, butterscotch and vanilla. Very oily mouthfeel. Finishes with long residuel sugar aftertaste.
Fort Street Double Scotch;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fort Street Brewery;On tap: Aroma of light butterscotch and lighter caramel. Pours a hazy amber with an off-white head. Flavor is very malty. Caramel up front with a hint of fruitiness. Finish has lots of butterscotch, moderate vanilla, and a light bitterness.
Church Brew Cherry Imperial Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Church Brew Works;This is a real nice one to look at - shiny charcoal black, 1/4 inch cocoa powder head that slides around the edges of the small glass leaving nice lacing. Aroma is strong - roasty and chocolate - where the heck’s the cherry?(-1 point for that one!). Taste - hmm, if I concentrate really hard, I can kind of taste some sweet fruitiness at the front, but it’s quickly followed by some chocolate and then a big whomp of roast and very assertive bitterness. A decent imperial stout, but again, where’s the cherry????? (On tap at the Church, 9/2005)
Church Brew Confessional Kolsch;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Church Brew Works;On tap at the Church, quite nice in flavor with that clean bitter hop taste over some light fruity notes, the color though was a light amber, not traditional golden but still one of the better attempts I have had in the States
Church Brew Confessional Kolsch;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Church Brew Works;Deep golden color, a bit on the dark side for a kolsch. Aroma is subtle grain and mild fruity ester. Very smooth mouthfeel with substantial fruitiness which I actually appreciated. Good for the summer season.
Church Brew Confessional Kolsch;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Church Brew Works;"8/25/2009: Church Brew Confessional Kolsch... Aroma: Like a gentle Pils; doesn’t give much away; hints of orange peel. Appearance: Transparent light golden-color; nothin on top to speak of. Flavor: Mildly sweet pale/Pils malt, slightly toasted; crisp grassy and spicy hops finish; a touch of creamy wheat; mild to moderate bitterness. Palate: Medium-light body; really smooth; slips down very well. Overall: Quite good! Draught at Church Brew Works in Pittsburgh, PA. Rating #3 for this beer."
Church Brew Confessional Kolsch;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Church Brew Works;On tap at Church Brew works while in PA> A german style grain bill with a west-coast hop profile. incredibly drinkable, and a very nice beer. i taste simcoe or possibly amarillo hops in the flavor profile, which is odd for this style, but the new brewer at church pulls this off very well. very light, very clean tasting, with an excellent hop flavor and a wonderful malt backdrop. cheers to creating an american version of a german style with a beautiful hop flavor that is NOT hiding behind an IPA (for once).
Church Brew Confessional Kolsch;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Church Brew Works;"I must confess, I really liked this beer. 3.6% - wow, that’s pretty light, is it going to have any flavor at all??? Yup - excellent - lot’s of tastyness in this light brew - I had 2 pints just to verify that fact. Not much aroma in this at all (unfortunately). Body is spritzy, medium bodied. Maltiness is bready although somewhat transparent. Hops - yeah - a little grassy, lightly bitter, peppery, I’d guess Hallertau and at least one or two others in there. I don’t know why this is on in late September - They could sell a whole lot of this in the hot summer weather. Another beer for the ""Lawn-mowin’ Beer Hall of Fame"" (On tap at the Church, 9/2005)"
Ice Harbor Dry Irish Stout;Kennewick, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Ice Harbor Brewing Company;On draught at the brewery. Light-bodied and opaque. A roasted barley character but not much else. A very dry finish. Could use richer, complementary dark malts coming through.
Neuzeller Marathon;Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;500ml bottle. Clear, orangey golden colour with average, frothy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, white head. Weak, mellow malty aroma with a cereal touch, cautious hoppy overtones. Taste is minimally sweet malty with a grainy and cereal touch, hints of cornflakes, honey, slightly bitter hoppy counterweight. Relatively weak and expressionless.
Neuzeller Marathon;Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;Bottle. Medium gold with a short white head. Aroma and flavour are corn and malt. Finish is sour syrup
Neuzeller Marathon;Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;Bottle, 4.8%. Clear golden colour. Big stable white head. The flavour is bready and a bit old-tasting, a little papery. Strange bitterness, probably from the weird vitamin they felt they had to add.

Bottroper Brauhaus Bottich Spezial;Bottrop, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Bottroper Brauhaus Bottich;(Growler 200 cl) Beautiful, dark amber with a slight haze and a rather full and stable head. Soft and malty, lightly sweet without much bitterness. And then it comes with this hard-to-define homebrewed touch. Neat. 280404
Bottroper Brauhaus Bottich Urtyp;Bottrop, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bottroper Brauhaus Bottich;On tap at the brewpub. The beer is clear pale gold in the glass.

Elland Blonde;Elland, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Elland Brewery;From cask at The Cask, Manchester, with JFE and BG 21.01.18. Clear golden. Dense and persistent off-white head and lacing. Excellently balanced arom and taste of meadows, citrus, pale malt and marmalade.

Elland Blonde;Elland, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Elland Brewery;"Cask at the Lamp Tavern; golden yellow pour with a thin bubbly white head, aroma has citrus, taste has refreshing citrus action, sweet malts, refreshing gold."
Elland Blonde;Elland, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Elland Brewery;Gravicask (Black Door, Helsinki) Slightly popcorny aroma, more than I’m in the mood for now. Some might view it as honey. Taste however, is lovely and malty, but with some nice dry nuttiness. Palate is soft, carbonation low. Finisah gently bitter. Popcorn forgiven, I quite like this now it’s in the mouth.
Elland Blonde;Elland, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Elland Brewery;Cask @ Black Door. Poured light amber in color with no head. Toffeeish malty with some grassy notes. Woody, nutty, hay in flavor. Drinkable. Soft.

Elland Blonde;Elland, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Elland Brewery;(Cask, gravity, at Black Door, 20160701) The beer poured deep golden and clear. Its head was small and white. Aroma had earth, toffee and malts. Palate was medium bodied with low carbonation. Flavours were fruitiness, toffee, earth, grass and bitterness. Aftertaste was hoppy and bitter. A good hoppy English ale.
La Barberie Cuivrée au Thé;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Other;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Pours a hazy copper topped by a finger of creamy light beige head, showing great retention and lacing properties. Very high carbonation. The nose gives off lemon zest and heather, with some faint roasted malts. Very fruity, makes you think of a lambic. The taste is quite similar, with a medium body and notable tartness that lingers. The brew is fruity and acidic, but I don’t get much tea out of it, except for the tart feel. Still, an interesting pick. Cheers!
75th Street Merry Morgans Bridal Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;75th Street Brewery;On tap at the KC brewpub. It pour a cloudy yellow/orange. Was serve with a nice head, but I looked away and it was gone. The dominate aroma was a funky yeastiness. Wheat and citrus notes also detectable. Cinnamon, nutmeg, banana, clove, and some citrus. Low carbonation. Pretty full bodies and way too sweet. I’m glad to see 75th Street trying some new styles.
Shed Biere de Miel;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;20061007 Tap at Kennett. Shed Biere de Miel with Brett, I guess this is it. Another winner from The Shed. Pale, hazed gold. I may be interpolating floral notes because of brett. Nicely dried out quencher with citrus and horseblanket notes.
Shed Biere de Miel;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Another Shed beer courtesy of weeare138. Crystal clear, shiny gold body with a filmy white head. Spicy lemon and honey aroma. Has peppery notes like an Abbey Tripel. Flavor has clove-like phenolic elements and residual honey characters, but not excessively sweet. Modest, sticky mouthfeel. Solid and interesting.
Shed Biere de Miel;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Another fantastic one at NEBF. Expressive, yet soft and inviting nose with wild flowers, soft, pillowy honey and grains, sticky orange juice, clean Belgian yeast and artfully done citrus peel and light spicing. A light yellow fruitiness graces the back of the nostrils while a bit more poignant pepperiness is noted as well. The flavor was wonderfully full and succulent. Wildflower honey is definitely present, as you let the liquid sit in your mouth. Lavendar and vanilla blossoms, light peppery spices and sweaty hops. A hint of limey brett is noted on the end, along with a lightly grainy malt. Mouthfeel is again spectacular, as in the regular saison. Dosent load up on meaty yeast or heavy spices, while the mouthfeel feels more like a real Belgian. Truly great stuff.
Shed Biere de Miel;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;NEBF ’05 A lot of thinsg going on here, fruit,mainly citrus and spice. Mild brett? charcater possibly, with some funkiness. Quite nice, I’m wish it was a warmer summer day as this probably would be more thirst quenching then watching the snow fall from inside.
Shed Biere de Miel;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;"Much thanks to grassrootsVT... According to the brewer, Shaun E. Hill, this was made with 15% wildflower/clove honey, making for a nice spin on a ""honey beer"" aka biere de miel. Appears a cloudy gold with a small white cap. Streaks of spotty lacing are left behind in the glass. Smell is yeasty, bready, honey...outright addictive aroma in my opinion. The Chouffe yeast plays out nicely in this beer. Taste is of lemony zest, honey, sweet bready earthiness and perhaps a slight bit of tropical fruit salad buried in there. Mild hoppiness. Mouthfeel is a strongpoint as well with this beer. Yeasty, medium bodied, bready, semi-dry, and mildly carbonated. Drinkability is good! It’s about time that a U.S. brewery/brewpub gets bold and brews a version of this. Well done!"
Shed Biere de Miel;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Hand bottled sample from the brewer thanks to weeare138 (thanks!). Poured a medium and cloudy golden color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas of citrus, honey, yeast, and leather. Tastes of citrus, yeast, honey, lemons and a little earthiness as well. Light sweet start with a tart finish.
Shed Biere de Miel;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Poured a hazy golden color with a small, white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrus, some barnyard, honey, light brett, , earth, and flowers. Taste of light caramel malt, dry yeast, more earth, citrus, and a faint German hoppiness.
Shed Abbaye;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;NEBF ’05 Deep amber/brown,hazy with a small light tan head.Aroma of dark fruit,rasins,dates, and bready yeast and mat. Taste is bready,yeasty moderately bitter with alittle sweetness coming through. My favoite Shed beer so far
Shed Abbaye;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Much thanks to grassrootsVT for this... Appears a dark amber with a nice off-white head that never really fades out. Streaks of lacing are left along the interior of the glass. Smell is of dark fruit, freshly baked bread, raisins, figs, as well as the classic Chimay yeast that bumps it up a notch in my opinion. Taste is bready with sugary figs and raisins standing out, along with a nice maltiness that has a pleasant roasted nuttiness about it. Mouthfeel is sugary, medium carbonation, bready, and very pleasant. Drinkability is good. Very well done and the yeast is implemented nicely. The Shed has a winner with Shaun Hill. I expect to hear great things from him in the near future.
Shed Abbaye;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Hand bottled sample from the brewer thanks to weeare138 (thanks!). Poured a dark and cloudy brownish color with a small off white head. Aromas of yeast, dark fruits with some spices. Tastes of dark fruits (prunes and dark cherries) and yeast.
Shed Abbaye;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Poured a hazy brown color with a thin, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of dried fruits, spices, dried fruits, and yeast. Taste of more dried fruits, cherries, caramel malts, plums, light roasted malts, and some more yeast as well. I also noticed some rum in the taste.
Shed Saison;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Sampled at brewpub in Feb. Poured yellow gold soda-like body with a small white head. Lots of barnyard and spices in the nose. Flavors are citrus, lemongrass, some oranges with peel, various spices with a peppery hop finish. Solid saison.
Shed Saison;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Sampled at the brewpub with beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, tiggmtl, Rastacouere and Yowie in early December. Translucent gold, slight bubbling, thick thick lace and a touch of lasting head...soft vanilla, coriander and cumin in the spicy nose...lots of herbal qualities in the body, bit lactic, well-balanced sweet-sourness, touch of oregano.
Shed Saison;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Pale shining golden, faint haze, nicely lacing white foam remains thin and diminishes quickly. Spicy coriandered nose contains a lot of grainy malt character that grows into hay-like notes, but remains sweet all through. Shy noble hops would gain from being more active in the portrait. Tannic tea-like nature develops as it warms, hinting at chamomile and eventually mustard seed, certainly very spicy and grainy sweet. Light-medium body, fine-bubbled carbonation that could be more expressive..
Shed Saison;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Haylike, herbal hops with doughlike, lightly spicy yeast character in the aroma. Some notes of citrus and an underlying cookielike sweetness are also notable. Hazy yellow gold body is topped by a decent white head that recedes slowly to partial cover with some lacing. Haylike, herbal hop flavour is up front joined by coriander spiciness. Some minerallic notes. Medium light body with lively, lightly pointy carbonation. Sampled on tap at the brewpub with beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, muzzlehatch, Rastacouere and Yowie.
Shed Saison;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Pours a cloudy golden color with a thin white head. Aroma of malt, spices and fruits. The flavor is pretty much the same, malt, spices and fruits but it feels bland and it seems there’s something not right at all in there. The palate is light and oily with soft carbonation.
Shed Saison;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;The Lure: Citrusy hay and dry toastiness surround the fruity sweetness. A drop of sulphur and urine worries. The Festivities: Pineapple juice and dry toasted malt bitterness coexist peacefully. The omnipresent mineral ailment there in all Shed pints that day points its ugly nose and weakens the mouthfeel. Transcendence: An onset of rust is a warning.
Shed Saison;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;On draught at NEBF, 10/29/05. A lovely rusty copper-yellow beer, fully hazy with a nice foamy white head, decent retention and fair lacing. Aroma gives off some funky barnyard notes, though nothing too extreme, just light brett-like notes as others have noted, with a dry white pepper and lemon-acidity. Smell does note overwhelm with the usual American over-spiced spiciness. A nice smooth yeast is more up front, soft and floral hops notes with light honey and vanilla. Flavor is very yeasty, though not meaty like in some American saisons. Again the yeast comes through clean and elegant, with light brett, pils malt and pepper. Mild hoppiness rounds out the finish with a slight citric bite. The brett is quite pronounced and it almost seems borderline sour, like there is lacto in there, though I dont think there is. Dusty, dry mouthfeel with low carbonation. Awesome, finally a decent saison in New England!!
Shed Saison;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Draft @ NEBF. Pours a hazy golden color with a medium foamy head. Nose is lightly peppery and spicy, with some light citrus involved. Taste is very nice. Some light citrus, hints of peppery lemon, and some nice grassy spiciness. A hint of yeast here and there, very well balanced.
Shed Saison;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Much thanks to grassrootsVT for this... Appears a hazy light gold with a small white cap that seems to have good retention. Streaky lacing is left behind. The aromas are of slight sulphur(perhaps something went awry with bottle conditioning?), peppery spice, barnyard funk, and citrus. Unfortunately, something happened with the aroma in the bottles. Shaun admittedly isn’t a fan of the sulphur aroma coming from the bottled version of this brew. The draft version, however, was devoid of such an aroma and he has assured me that it is still the case. Perhaps another sampling direct from draft will make me rerate at a future time. Taste is peppery, citrusy, spicy, along with the Dupont yeastiness. Mouthfeel has that nice spicyness with a semi dry feel and a mild linger. Nice use of the yeast comes through. Once I got past the sulphury aroma in the bottled version, all the subtleties and characteristics are there for a good saison.
Shed Saison;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Hand bottled sample from the brewer thanks to weeare138 (thanks!). Poured a lighter and cloudy golden color with an averaged sized white head. Major sulphur aroma that was almost hard to get around. Other aromas of leather and citrus lurking in the background. Tastes of lemon, citrus, brett and spices.

Govnors Public House Fohrnharfest;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Govnors Public House;Deep copper with a tiny head. Sour-milk aroma with subtle spicing... no malt-assault as I’d hoped. Very medicore. I wouldn’t have guessed it a Märzen. On tap at Govnor’s Public House, Lake In The Hills, IL
Govnors Public House Fohrnharfest;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Govnors Public House;So this beer is ’very popular’ acording to the waiter and when he came up while I was drinking it and asked if I liked it he was almost confused when I said not really. The color is copper dark with a thin off white almost head to it. The head was farily long lasting and good lacing on the glass. The nose is malty with just a hint of caramel with barley kind of lagery character. The taste was flat with a strange kind of kick of citrus behind a strong grainy character and caramel. Not really that interesting, I wonder if there was something wrong with this beer.
Samuel Adams 375 Colonial Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Boston Beer Company;APPEARANCE- medium brown. FLAVOR- noticeably smooth, slight sweetness. Very little roasty flavor (which makes sense considering the malt bill). The blackstrap molasses probably adds to the sweetness I’m tasting. It is called a brown, but it doesn’t ’fit’ within the typocal types of brown ales today. NOTES- cool that it’s only available in Union Oyster House in Boston. Definitely one of the most I interesting and good beers ive had from Sam.
Samuel Adams 375 Colonial Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Boston Beer Company;Very tasty unfiltered brown Ale on tap at Union oyster. Great flavor, hint of Molasses. Could drink this all day as a session Ale.

Samuel Adams 375 Colonial Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Boston Beer Company;My first traditional ale....aroma is mildly sweet with some nutty malt presence and spice. Flavor is mainly malt, with caramel and toffee on the front...finishes with a lingering roasted malt character. Wasn’t that great, but nothing to complain about.
Samuel Adams 375 Colonial Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Boston Beer Company;This is still pouring at the Union Oyster House in Boston. Pours a deep brown into a shaker. Nice, off-white head with medium retention. No aromas. Flavor leans to malt, but was served way too cold to get an idea of the full flavor. Refreshing non-the-less.
Samuel Adams 375 Colonial Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Boston Beer Company;Loved ths ale. A true old colonial ale that brings you back in time with every sip.

Alsfelder Zip Cola;Alsfeld, Hesse, Germany;Flavored - Other;Brauerei Alsfeld;"Uhhh - what a beutiful blue bottle. The ""beer"" is brownish with a thin rim of off white head.

Alsfelder Zip Cola;Alsfeld, Hesse, Germany;Flavored - Other;Brauerei Alsfeld;(Bottle 33 cl) I’ve had Altbier and cola before, but I believe this is my first pils and cola.

Hochdorfer Radler;Nagold, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Hochdorfer Kronenbrauerei Nagold;"(Bottle 50 cl) Clear yellow, almost no head. Unfortunately the added lemonade contains an artificial sweetener which really shines through.

McNeill's Pay Day;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;McNeill's Brewery;Well I guess there’s not much too say that hasn’t been said, so I’ll say that overall I like Mcneill’s brews. This one not so much. Aroma has a funky smoke to it, oh yeah this bottle is from last christmas, so I have no idea how much older it may be. Poured a dark hazened yellow. Flavor is grainy to me. Palate isn’t anything to complain about this just wasn’t for me. Maybe I’ll crack that imperial stout soon.
McNeill's Pay Day;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;McNeill's Brewery;Slighlty hazy amber color, with a small ring of a head. Burnt plastic aroma with notes of plums. Grassy bitter flavor, with grainy, cereal-like malts. Not my cup of tea.
McNeill's Pay Day;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;McNeill's Brewery;Thanks to Frylock for this one. Orangey copper body, thin tan head. Nose is kind of plasticy - some orange & lemon. Very boozy - cereal, lemon, orange, caramel. Doughy bready finish. Very grassy.
McNeill's Pay Day;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;McNeill's Brewery;Big time drain pour. Aroma wasn’t bad, very citrusy. Pooked nice, cloudy of course. Flavor was obnoxiously strong citrus and soap, like rotten fruit dish soap.
McNeill's Pay Day;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;McNeill's Brewery;Pours amber with a thin rim of white bubbles. Smells of citrus and some sugar. Taste is very citrussy with some caramel on the finish.
McNeill's Pay Day;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;McNeill's Brewery;Poured an amber color with a thin, off white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of caramel malts, light citrus and metal. Taste is much better. Some grains, sweet caramel malts, dough, some citrus, light bitterness, and a dry finish.
McNeill's Pay Day;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;McNeill's Brewery;22 oz bottle direct from the brewery. Dark amber with a slight, quickly dissipating, white head. Aroma is is dusty, kind of like basement mold. Clean and well balanced with a slight rise in hops at the finish turning to a long moderately lingering bitterness. Drying finish. Decent, but not nearly of the caliber of other McNeil’s brews.
McNeill's Pay Day;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;McNeill's Brewery;22oz bottle: Pours to a slightly hazy light-medium amber body with a small light beige head. Shines light copper when held to the light. Aroma is light grain, mild fruit, a hint of yeast, and a very light dough. Taste is light grain, wet sweaty grains, a hint of lemon, yeast, pale malt, and light hints of salty water and bready malt. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, finishes with a hint of good grains, floral/grassy hops, and a bare hint of citrus. Excellent mouthfeel and body, no off flavors whatsoever. No sourness anywhere in my sample.
McNeill's Pay Day;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;McNeill's Brewery;"22 oz bottle direct from the brewery - this version is NOT the bottle-conditioned version that has received some rather negative reviews below. Color is clear light amber and there is appropriate carbonation though head retention is minimal. Aroma is minimal, and clean appropriate for style. What really stands out in this beer is the solid malt backbone that is really deliciously grainy, with a very slight sweetness. Hops are there minimally for balance not for show. The bottom line: this is a very well crafted Vienna Lager, not an easy style to pull off as there are no huge IBU’s or dark malts to hide behind. I realize that the bulk of Ratebeerians are hopheads or highgrav freaks, and might care less for a ""mild"" style such as this, but from what I hear the folks of Brattleboro have embraced Pay Day as a session beer worthy of your attention. The high drinkability of this beer might lend itself to serve as an intro microbeer for somebody who has never had anything more exciting than a Bass Ale. It is unfortunate that from the negative reviews I have read, the initially unfiltered bottle-conditioned version of the beer had an aggressive yeasty assertion that must have overpowered the subtle beauty of this beer."
McNeill's Pay Day;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;McNeill's Brewery;"(22 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with jjpm74, thanks John!) McNeill’s beers have a very short shelf life in my experience, so as soon as I got this beer in trade, I put it in the refrigerator in a brown paper bag to keep the fridge light from impacting the beer, and now I’m drinking it five days later. That’s about the best I can do in a trade. Having stated this, I’m hoping the mild to moderate sourness is intended because it’s not very subtle. It seems more like a sourdough type of sourness rather than a citrusy one, and though it’s not exactly enjoyable, it doesn’t make this beer an instant drainpour either. Still, there isn’t too much behind the sourness, which is why it’s so apparent. The mildly flavorful malt base seems very grainy and husky with just a hint of smokiness in the finish, and there is only a modest amount of hops for very gentle bitterness. Far in the background is a light sweetness that seems vaguely fruity, though no specific fruit jumps out at me. The nose is far from aromatic, with just a modest graininess and slight tartness. Body is light-medium and carbonation is fairly low, but the sourness at least keeps the palate refreshed. Orange amber in color and fairly cloudy in appearance, but there is enough translucence to see that there are no carbonation bubbles rising through the beer. No surprise there since there was barely a wimper when I popped the cap, and pouring the beer, I could only muster a thin filmy layer of ""head"". That film has of course long since disappeared and there is barely a ring around the edge now. Lacing is nothing more than a few sporadic spots. I wish I could say I enjoyed drinking this beer, but all in all, it’s just not very good. Maybe if it were less sour, it would be better, but even then, I still don’t think I’d enjoy it."

River City Framboise Razzberry Lambic;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);On tap at the 2006 Best of the Midwest Brewers’ Festival. Over 400 lbs. of fresh raspberries were used in the fermentation of this beer, according to the brewer, Dan. he does a secondary fermentation in red wine barrels for over one year. This smells and tastes much more like a Flemmish Sour than a lambic. I thought that it was pretty awesome. Dark orange-copper in color with absolutely no head at all. Tangy vinegary citrus aroma is powerful, but clean. Strong raspberry flavor, but tart, extremely tart. Very medicinal in flavor and aroma due to the strain of yeast. Some nuttiness, but no sweetness at all. Outstanding!
River City Framboise Razzberry Lambic;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Lambic - Fruited;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);Pinkish cloudy, served fairly cool in a fluted pilsner at the brewpub. Medium, fizzy head tinted slightly pink. Aroma is sourdoughish, hints of raspberry. Flavor initially very sour and acidic, almost a vinegarish quality to it. Raspberry understated, serves to cut the sourness just a little. No barnyard funk. Cleanish finish, and a surprising level of bittering hops in the finish. Actually the hops are a bit much, out of place.
Haigerlocher Radler Halbe;Haigerloch, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Schlossbrauerei Haigerloch;(Bottle 50 cl) Pale golden with a fine, airy head. Very fresh with the lemonade containing real sugar and not artificial sweeteners. Has a real underlying beery feel. If it has to be Radler this is one of the better examples. 070802
Wild Blossom Wild Prairie Berry;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mead;Wild Blossom Meadery & Winery;Poured a nice dark red with a nose that really popped of mixed berries.

Wild Blossom Wild Prairie Berry;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mead;Wild Blossom Meadery & Winery;Rated on 4-11-2009 at Fort Wayne Gathering (Bottle). This Mead pours a small pink very fizzy head with a very short retention, transparent red body, and very little carbonation. The Aroma is sweet, sour, tart, honey, and berries. The Taste mimics the Aroma. The Palate is lightly tingly and this is a light-medium Mead. Overall, at 12%ABV, this Mead is easy to drink as there isn’t a lot going on with the flavors as this Mead is on the light side of Meads.
Wild Blossom Wild Prairie Berry;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mead;Wild Blossom Meadery & Winery;Mead Flight at Bad Apple (Chicago, IL). Pours a deep crimsob hue, gentle haziness, no real head.

Solid offering, the nose is it’s strength. Solid, a touch warm at times.
Wild Blossom Wild Prairie Berry;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mead;Wild Blossom Meadery & Winery;Sampled at Bad Apple.

Wild Blossom Wild Prairie Berry;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mead;Wild Blossom Meadery & Winery;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized clear colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a transparent uncarbonated brown colored body and a fair lacing. The weak aroma was berry. The crisp bubbly mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The mild flavor contained notes of berry sweet and sour. Not one that I would likely buy again.
Wild Blossom Wild Prairie Berry;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mead;Wild Blossom Meadery & Winery;bottle courtesy of thedm and hotstuff at Ft Wayne tasting - Pours clear reddish purple. The aroma is of honey and berries. Duh. The flavor is semi-sweet with nice berry flavors. It leaves a sweet, alcoholic finish and struck me as a little on the watery side. .
Wild Blossom Wild Prairie Berry;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mead;Wild Blossom Meadery & Winery;750 ml bottle shared with my wife. Pours a clear pinkish, purplish, red with a few carbonation bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. Very pleasant aroma of sweet berries. The flavor is mostly berries, but not as intense as the aroma. There is some mild honey flavor, but that is lurking in the background more than anything else and never really steps forward. Acidic and a bit tart towards the finish. Lightly effervescent.
Wild Blossom Wild Prairie Berry;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mead;Wild Blossom Meadery & Winery;Thanks to Holdenn for bringing this to DLD. Just found my notes on this. Poured a deep red/purple color. Nice berry sweet aroma. Taste was sticky sweet honey, berries were tart to start and seemed to get sweeter as I went. I really enjoyed this. A little sweet, but great in small amounts.
Wild Blossom Wild Prairie Berry;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Mead;Wild Blossom Meadery & Winery;750 ml bottle brought to DLD. I’ve had this for over a year, and I’ve been looking for a reason to open a whole bottle of mead. Pours a red purple color with a bubbled clear white head. Nose is sweet and fruity. Lots of mulberries and inconspicuous berries. Some residual honey sweetness but the sweetness is balanced with a light berry tartness. The flavor is filled with more of those mulberries that I used to pick from the tree in my backyard for most of my childhood. Well done. I enjoyed this quite a bit.
Highgate Old Ember;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Old Ale;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Bottle. Rich dark very malty strong ale with roasted malt, chocolate, citrus fruits and hops. Very drinkable. Enjoyed this. Nice Old Ale. (2008)

Highgate Old Ember;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Old Ale;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Brown 500ml bottle, best before July 2010, drank and reviewed April 2010. Poured twice into a Gordon’s Thislr shaped glass. Deep dark brown/reddy colour with a good thick cream coloured head. The head produced some good lacing and managed to stay through the tasting. Semi-sweet malty aroma, biscuits more than toast or bread, a light burntness/roasty feel to the smell. The taste is half malt, half bitter hop (Fuggles and Progress are used). There is a tangy citrus (pink grapefruit?) feel as well. Well carbonated, the alcohol can be felt but it doesn’t rule the mouthfeel because the body is fairly rich and creamy. Pleasant but no world beater.

Highgate Old Ember;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Old Ale;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Liked this more than I thought I would.

Cascade Amber Ale;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Dark red in colour with small spritzy head, weak aroma of malt. A poor redention of an Aussie trying to be Seppo. (Bonus points for powerpoint label, sorry Neil, thought label was great)
Cascade Amber Ale;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);"A vast improvement on the brewer’s Four Seasons Autumn Amber. Can’t say I looked forward to trying this but it’s not bad at all - one of Cascade’s better brews. It looks... em... amber and failed to raise more than a thin film for a head, with moderate lacing. The aroma was more promising, with blackberry jam and quince paste bouncing on a fat bed of crystal malt. It’s very sweet-smelling but with an earthy undertone. In the mouth, it’s mainly chewy toffee with more quince paste before the mildest of dry finishes, In fact, it falls away at the end. Where’s that ""extra gift of hops""? Reminded me of a bantamwieght version of one of the chewier US pale ales but lacking real punch. There’s a little pine in the mix here but it’s subtle. The more I drank this, the more I liked it. (375ml bottle, bb 22/5/06)"
Cascade Amber Ale;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Lots of toffee malt in this, but it’s rather thin and sweet. The sweetness and bitterness seem to gang up on the tongue and, for me, make it rather unpleasant - mostly from the sweetness. However if I treat it more as a quaffing drink, which is probably the way it’s intended, the flavours aren’t so overbearing and it isn’t so cloying. Anyway, it’s good to see a macro brewery having a go at something different.
Cascade Amber Ale;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Malt hop aroma. Clear amber colour with fair head nad good lacing. Bitter malt flavour with hops. Smooth palate.
Cascade Amber Ale;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Light amber in colour, with a thin white head. Aroma is quite rich with caramel, not bad at all.

Cascade Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle. Pale gold with a white head that doesn’t hang around. Aroma is lemony and a bit grainy with obvious wheat. Light bodied. Crackery with little bitterness but a whack of lemon and a dryish finish. A wheat lager, eh? An OK dust cutter for a warm evening.
Cascade Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);330ml bottle into glass. Pours a cloudy amber with little to no head. Slight sweet toffee nose. Not impressive 1st taste. A bit watery, cooked vegetables. A little bit of malt. The aftertaste is ordinary just staying out of VB territory. Bit disappointing actually.
Cascade Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Sweet fruity aroma. Clear golden colour with poor head. Light fruity flavor with long aftertaste. Light body with low carbonation.
Cascade Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Pours a straw colour with plenty of bubbles. Little head. And not much of a wheat taste. Nice mouthfeel if not a bit watery. Smooth finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Cascade Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);330mL bottle, nice bottle actually! Straw body, bit of haze, small white head. Light aroma, distinctly wheaty cereal maltiness, some floral hop, and a slight lactic twang...? Light body, reasonably lively carbonation, slightly twang of acidity about it. Cereal, Weetbix-like malts upfront, some more of that floral, herbal hop character. Low bitterness to finish, bit of spice. Not sure why this is entered as a lager, quite clearly a wheat beer of sorts, but anyway. Not all that bad.
Cascade Blonde;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Clear yellow pour, very little head or aromas. Strong initial malty flavours with a little citrus and hob bitterness to finish. For a mass produced beer, decent.

Silver City Oktoberfest;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Silver City Brewery;22 oz bottle poured. Can’t think of any better way of starting off September. Oktoberfest! There’s only one October! The baseball fan in me with always love that expression. The beer fan in me loves that a fest named after a single month seems to last over 3 months. I’m happy to start of the fall season today. Bring on the football, and good beer. Pours a clear copper color with a lasting head. Bready malt aroma. Flavor is light and malty. Hints of sweetness.

Sinebrychoff Krouvi;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Zu diesem Bier gibt es nicht allzuviel zu sagen, es riecht wie ein Weizen und es schmeckt auch so. Hefig, hopfig, kaum säuerlich. Der Nachgeschmack ist leider kaum schmeckbar. Test vom 8.8.2006, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 8,11,11,7,9,9 - 9,20
Sinebrychoff Krouvi;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);bottled. rusty reddish colour with not much of a head. curious raspberry aroma, soft texture, quite sweet with some raspberry flavour. not too bad, just could use some bitterness or sourness to balance it out

Sinebrychoff Krouvi;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Bottle, 5.2%. Strange small, a little spicy with some sewer. Salty weirdness. Hazy amber colour. Wheaty mouthfeel and aftertaste. A little sourness, but that is overshadowed by the spices and a sour fruitiness.
Sinebrychoff Krouvi;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Not my cup of tea. This is sort of sweet, banana-like, grainy porridge, weissbier thing. It’s too hybrid of everything for me. I actually didn’t know it’s retired. Too bad, since it was kinda interesting experiment.
Sinebrychoff Krouvi;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);"courtesy of oh6gdx - pours a hazy amber-orange colour, decent white head and a nice lace; aroma of bread and fruits bubblegum; very carbonated, medium-bodied, short and moderately dusty, bready finish"
Sinebrychoff Krouvi;Kerava, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Bottle, Logan pre-GABF 2006 tasting (thanks to Degarth). Head is mostly diminishing. Body is light amber. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (grain, husks, caramel), with a note of peach. Flavor is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Pretty uninteresting and somewhat grainy, but ok.

Grand Union One Hop: Chinook;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask handpull at Wenlock Arms, London. Gold colour with lasting white head. Wonderful nose of chinook hops. Fullish in mouth and then kicking spicey hop finish. Brilliant.
Grand Union One Hop: Chinook;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask (handpump), Willow Walk (JDW), London SW1. Pale gold colour with a thin white head. Whilst the Grand Union One Hop concept is an interesting one, sometimes I think it is sometimes compromised by rather timid hop levels. Either Chinook is not as aromatic as other US hops or that applies to this beer. The subtle aroma (may be more down to JDW serving temperature than the beer itself) is more grassy than perfumed. Flavour is mainly citric - lots of grapefruit - with a spicy bite. Very dry and quite bitter, this develops strongly on the finish and in the lasting aftertaste. Its a very fresh tasting beer, with a crisp mouthfeel. A good quaffer, but hardly bursting with flavour.
Pietra Porto Latino;Furiani, Corsica, France;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Pietra;first,when opening the bottle,one can smell hops,but once in the glass,it smells sweater.drinking it,i found it very sweet,but i could still taste a little bit of hops.tasts more like a beer-mix drink than a classical spice-beer.has some kind of artificial taste.would be better if it was more bitter.,but so,it’s to sweet.by the way,nice bottle design.

Van Pur Carpatia;Warsaw, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Van Pur S.A.;No 605 Rated: 24.10.2008 Bottle brown, 500 ml Appearance: Pours dark, brownish gold, olive oil like body colour. There are sediments floating in the body texture, carbonation is mild, saturation too, head is initially medium, slowly decreasing to small, white in colour, frothy, fair lacing. Aroma: The pronounced and dominating hoppy, flowery, weizen - like hops being very positive and surprising for a Pale Lager, gentle malted barley background, citrussy, orange, peach, well ballanced, alcohol is quite well hidden with only gentle accent, notes of winegrapes, generally sweet aroma reminding an European Strong Lager. Flavour: One of the best beers of Van Pur that I’ve tasted and I’ve tasted 34 so far, maybe apart from ’Zlaty Hrad Strong’ being even better. There is however some accidity like from brewing cereal in the aftertaste. What is positive about this beer is very nice, impressive, selected hoppy profile, some notes of honey, some saltyness on palate, notes of sweetness and additional burned sugar. Finish duration is medium. Palate: Body is light to medium, texture is wattery, carbonation on palate is moderate, finish feel is kind of astringent but rather lightly and flat.

Per³a Goolman Gold;Lublin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Perla - Browary Lubelskie;"Rated 25 November 2006; 5 January 2006. 500ml bottle, white (nice shape for a bottle of quite a plain lager in Poland), Head average, bitter, refreshing, hops a bit aromatic but their content is reduced due to the white bottle to escape the problem of skunkness what is quite clever and wise. Light amber colour, quite a lager but of course best only of the mediocre."
Per³a Goolman Gold;Lublin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Perla - Browary Lubelskie;I’m looking back on my rating for the pilsener by Goolman and I’m struck by how this beer is pretty much identical (although having them side by side would help sort things out). Anyway, as I recall, this beer had almost no hop character to speak of-- just sweet creamed-corn aroma and corn syrup malt that became too much in the end. A waste of a fancy bottle design.
Per³a Goolman Gold;Lublin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Perla - Browary Lubelskie;This sounds like that little sassy barmaid from Cheers. Married to Danny de Vito isn’t she? The dreaded pale lager curse strikes again I think. The highlandladdie hits in on the head with the description of ’industrial’. Beer for the proletariat and not much more. Generally it has a dumbed down taste that most euro lagers demonstrate. It would have to be a record lawnmowing session to get me to like this one.
Per³a Goolman Gold;Lublin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Perla - Browary Lubelskie;Rating from January 2005. Falsely put under Perla Goolman!?!? Tasted from the bottle, the first warning signs were there just from the clear glass. Poured a honeyish pale gold with light bubbles that raised up sluggishly to a big dense white head that barely held. Very low malt aroma, honeyish, sweet. Little complexity in the mouth, honey in front, hint of fruity esters across the palate with the mild carbonation leading to a medium length, sweet swallow. Noticeable diacetyl slickness and a soapiness mars the mouthfeel. Too sweet, no complexity, not my thing. (33cL, 12/04/05, Con’s Case Place)
Per³a Goolman Gold;Lublin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Perla - Browary Lubelskie;Orangey golden body with an average white head. Malt mainly on the aroma which took a little getting used to, then some rockmelon. Grain in the taste as well as soap, butterscotch and a little bit sweet.
Per³a Goolman Gold;Lublin, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Perla - Browary Lubelskie;Dull industrial Polish lager. Perfectly drinkable but as bland as a dumpling. Shocked to find this is my 8th Polish rating because I don’t remember any of them. This one came in a clear bottle, which is a bad start. This sample was only marginally light-struck but why take the risk. Standard lager gold, solid 0.5cm of foam, fair length. Hint of skunk in the aroma but the dominant notes are grass and butter on the turn. It’s not a diacetyl bomb but some palates may find it intolerable. Harsh, spritzy carbonation that can be tasted. Soap, hay and a sour finish. Moderate bitterness. Forgettable. (330ml bottle labelled Goolman Original Gold, abv 5.4%. Liquor on Parade, Kingsford. Best before 7/5/07)
Per³a Goolman Strong;Lublin, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Perla - Browary Lubelskie;Pours a pretty transparent medium gold. Fizzy thin head. Almost a white winey taste. Some maltiness and hops
Per³a Goolman Strong;Lublin, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Perla - Browary Lubelskie;Rated: 20.07.2007 Can, 500 ml, extract of wort 14,0% Appearance: Body is amber in colour, sparkling, medium carbonated head, gives some lacing, head is medium quickly decreasing to a small, frothy crown around the glass wall with lacing. Body is clear, transparent. Aroma: Chalky, milk, honey, alcoholic nose, malty sweetness, some hints of hops- nothing extraordinary, typical for Polish Strong Lager beer. Flavour: Sweet alcoholic nose, honey, additional extra sugar, malty sweetness, no bitterness or mayby a hint at finish on palate, you can feel some sparkling on palate, a hint of alcoholic cherry like, an addition on well build in cherry liquor, a bit grainy, nothing extraordinary, typical strong lager. Palate: Rather weak, finish is medium in duration, alcohol feel is rather heavy as well as sweetness is heavy. Not as drinkable as Goolman (Pilsener).
Per³a Goolman Strong;Lublin, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Perla - Browary Lubelskie;"Boring and heavy European strong. Standard golden colour, alcoholic & sweet taste. Nothing extraordinary; there is something peculiar about Lublin brews - very good lagers/pilseners and poor, below standard strong versions of those."

Four O;Plainfield, Indiana, United States;Malt Liquor;Copper Mountain Brewing Company;Can - Startchy grains. Pale yellow gold. Sweet corn and syrup. Not at all as unpleasant as I thought it would be,
Four O;Plainfield, Indiana, United States;Malt Liquor;Copper Mountain Brewing Company;Oh fuck! This has everything wrong w/ it that high gravity malts ever have wrong w/ them. Ok, well, at least it is clear. Aside from that though, it taste like nail polish, rotten apple and grass clippings. It is very much a gag worthy experience. Avoid this unless you are stupid.
Four O;Plainfield, Indiana, United States;Malt Liquor;Copper Mountain Brewing Company;40 oz. This is one of the holy grails of awful malts, just complete bum liquid, still think its sub 2.50 at least these days packing 10%. Acetone and fusel alcohol burn just ruins your senses.
Four O;Plainfield, Indiana, United States;Malt Liquor;Copper Mountain Brewing Company;"24 oz can to pint. Looks solid; a mostly transparent golden orange with fizzy eggshell head that steadily dissipates into thin lacing. Smells semi-sweet and mildly skunky with notes of corn and apple.

Four O;Plainfield, Indiana, United States;Malt Liquor;Copper Mountain Brewing Company;Typical. You know exactly what you’re about to get into when you purchase this. Sweet and malty, high alcohol. Not the most enjoyable but not the worst.
Great Dane Honey Wheat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at GD – Downtown. Poured clear honey-golden with a light cap of white head. The aroma picked up sweet honey all the way with touches of caramel and earthy wheat around.. well-balanced. The flavor found honey again, this time paired with dark fruit and vanilla sweetness.. spicy and tart wheat around.. sweet and tangy on the finish. Lighter-bodied with low carbonation on the palate.. a tad sharp at times, but still easy-drinkin’.
Great Dane Honey Wheat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On draught at the downtown Madison Great Dane location. Pours a clear golden amber colored brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that leaves behind some thin lacing. Aroma of fruity golden grain malt, a touch of honey, Crystal malt, and some floral hops. Taste is light to medium bodied, nice balanced honey and golden grain malt with a hint of floral/citrus bitterness. Finish is semi-sweet, some soft honey and golden grain malt aftertaste. It’s everything I expect in a Honey Ale. Solid and predictable.

Great Dane Honey Wheat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Slightly cloudy light golden color with a smaller wispy white head. Dry honey aromas with a touch of herbs and orange zest. Light wheaty start leading to a dryer honey and light citric fruit nip. Mild scone flavors finish things off. Mild and fairly drinkable. Another one for the masses, but there are times one needs a calibration type brew.
Great Dane Honey Wheat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"Sample at the Madison location. Clear oily honey color with a touch of head...herbal-minty-honey’d nose...sweet, inoffensive, sugar and perhaps a bit of strawberry...nice dry biscuity malt towards the finish. Not great but better than I would expect from a ""honey wheat""."
Fuller's Mr Harry (Cask);Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Pours a clar orange with an off-white head. Dry and malty. Slightly earthy. Hints of caramel. Soft carbonation. Mellow malty finish. Boring.
Fuller's Mr Harry (Cask);Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);First tasted this in Coanes, Johnstone in April 1987. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear orange amber in colour with a thin white head. Slight hint of fruity malt in the short nose. thin but creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives a digestive biscuit note mixed with caramel and dry raisin fruit. Short note of dry hop flowers impart a resiny metallic bitterness in the aftertaste. Finish is malty and slightly woody with oak cask notes. An ok session bitter.
Nashoba Valley Blackberry Ale;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;2007 bottle drunk on 6/28/07 To say my expectations were low for this would be an understatement…. Anywho, it definitely seems to be a golden ale base (as advertised), with some pink-violet hues swirled in. Off-white head is flecked with pink and is quite dense, though small and eventually receding to ring, leaving patches of lace. Clear, with prominent carbonation. Not as much going on in the nose (wait til the flavor) and I’m not sure how it manages to be so flavorful yet shows too much restraint in the aroma, but that seems to be the case. That said, there’s nothing bad going on here, your typical base malt vanilla-honey-cream backdrop with minimal blackberry acids and light, doughy yeast. Picks up some steam with warming and gets quite a good deal more aromatic in the blackberry department, though a gentle malt creaminess helps maintain balance, and its beer character. Unprepared for the flavor, I was blown away by the intensely creamy, but importantly, not cloying body/flavor. Definitely a good deal of blackberry sugars, but tons of malt softness that lends a honey-cream and graham cracker flavor, bordering on a bit of toffee/caramel. It dosent match the blackberry in stride, as far as flavor compatibility and there’s a touch of butteriness (not diacetyl though), but you can’t deny the wonderful body and strong beer character, which is about as rare as it gets for a beer like this (that black raspberry beer from Sly Fox was pretty on par with this too). More malt forward, and the blackberries lend a predictable fruity, sweet flavor, but there’s definitely an afterthought of tartness on the finish, which is just icing on the cake. No alcohol or flaws noted. I’ll probably grab another bottle of this if I see it.
Nashoba Valley Blackberry Ale;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;Pours a semi-cloudy orange/tan color leaving a thin faintly purple head that disappears quickly. The aroma is sour grapes, musty blanket, blackberry, honey, and lemon grass. The taste starts tart but moves to a sweetness like candy a sweet tart in partcular, then you quickly get a hay, powdery, lactic mouthfeel on the palate. The finish is dry very carbonated similar to a fruit wine with heat from the alcohal overall a decent brew and pretty refreshing.
Nashoba Valley Blackberry Ale;Bolton, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Nashoba Valley Winery / Bolton Beer Works;sampled at the brewery. lightly hazy orange/golden in color. Aroma is fresh blackberry, smells nice and fresh, and lightly tart/sour. It tastes like a standard golden ale, with alot of fresh blackberries coming through. the fruit throws off a bit of tartness and light funkyness, which may or may not have been intended, but I enjoyed it.

Mash House Hopocracy;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the Durham WBF. Clear amber with a big, off white head. Nice spiderweb lace. Big white grapefruit nose, some orange and pine. Somewhere in there a light caramel comes out, but this is all about the hops. An initial caramel sweetness is immediately battered into submission by the huge hop rush - grapefruit and pine dominate. Very much for the hophead, it’s a bit one dimensional but it does that bitter dimension rather well.

Mash House Hopocracy;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at Mash House. Clear deep orange/light amber pour. Heavy lace left behind by a frothy, creamy white head. the aroma is very hoppy, with what seems like miniscule backing malt. Notes of orange peel, grapefruit pith, pine needles, spicy yeast and light alcohol. The flavor is lightly sweet before intense hop bitterness sets in. Bitterness is full, oily and very quenching. Light toasted grains lurk in the depths and only reveal their true quantity in the finale. Finishes bitter, toasty, dry and crisp/clean. Very tasty, light and refreshing, similar to a less refined take on Bell’s Hopslam. The mouthfeel is light-medium to medium bodied, very smooth and a touch acidic/spicy.
Mash House Hopocracy;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;Sampled from a growler thanks to boboski on 7/2/06: Pours a clear copper orange with a nicely-lacing frothy white head. Aroma has some earthy citrus hops and mild caramel malty character. Body starts with a light malty sweetness, quickly turning more dry, floral, and bitter toward a mildly citric finish. Needs some more malty balance, but otherwise an ok IIPA.

New Knoxville Red Zone IPA;Knoxville, Tennessee, United States;IPA;New Knoxville Brewing Company;Hoppy, but not overly so. Pleasantly dry, clean, crisp, with a wonderful hop aroma.
New Knoxville Red Zone IPA;Knoxville, Tennessee, United States;IPA;New Knoxville Brewing Company;"draught. Red Zone is a murky copper with a fine, dense white head. Aroma is quite peppery with a bit of vinegar and faint malt. This is definitely hoppy. It’s biting and piny up front, a bit chalky; then fades to a little more tree bark. There is plenty of sour or acidic fruit flavor to this. The malts are just a bit thin to make a great balance, but this is quaffable enough."
New Knoxville Red Zone IPA;Knoxville, Tennessee, United States;IPA;New Knoxville Brewing Company;Draught (at Barley’s, of course). Pours red-gold with an off-white head that, while small, laced pretty well. The aroma is very smoothly hoppy with biscuity notes. The flavor is also fresh hops, reminiscent of sour apple and strawberry, with general bitterness. There is a touch of light malty sweetness in the background. I like it.
New Knoxville Red Zone IPA;Knoxville, Tennessee, United States;IPA;New Knoxville Brewing Company;On draught at Barley’s. This brew is the result of a homebrew competition held by Barley’s in Knoxville. Brewed by New Knoxville, under the supervision of the winning homebrewer usining his recipe. Smallish white head over a slightly hazy copper colored body. Good hop aroma. The flavor starts bitter and the hop bittereness goes all the way through to the finish. It could use a bit more malt in the middle to balance things out, but overall is a nicely done IPA. Please ask for this if you are at Barley’s in Knoxville. If this little experiment works out, they are considering adding brewing equipment of their own and offering in house brewed beers as part of their lineup on a regular basis.
New Knoxville Red Zone IPA;Knoxville, Tennessee, United States;IPA;New Knoxville Brewing Company;Reddish copper, no head to speak of. Really fresh hop aroma, with a floral, peppery note.

Big Ridge Spiced Belgian Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Big Ridge Brewing Co.;Has a very vague spice aroma. Appearance is a soft amber body with okay head.

Foothills Seeing Double IPA;Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Foothills Brewing;"Nice pour from the tap with slight head floating on the hazy amber base.

Surprisingly satisfying to the end."

Foothills Seeing Double IPA;Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Foothills Brewing;Found from bottle from Ingles in Franklin, NC. Clear golden color with medium head. Decent hopped-low for the style. Leaves an odd aftertaste. Decent for early Fall.
Foothills Seeing Double IPA;Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Foothills Brewing;"Fairly hazy copper and bright peach coloured body with a nice two centimetre tall just off-white head that fades fairly quickly and doesn't leave much on top. Aroma of very nice and floral grassy and herbal elements with a lot of the full hop bud noticeable along with some light alcohol and supportive malts and a touch of caster sugar and fruit-based sweetness near the end. Medium to Full-bodied; Deep robust and rich malt flavours that blend perfectly well with the well-hopped and pungent bitterness and floral, dank grassy flavours that come through with all the hops. Aftertaste is a touch floral with some good maltiness, a little dose of sweetness and fruity flavours come through, but the perfumey and herbal character shows through and is quite nice. Overall, a very well-balanced Imperial IPA with a ton of hop elements without a pungent bitterness, but a good span into complexity and more herbal and grassy qualities as well and away from alcohol and pungency. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Good Bottle Company in Charlotte, North Carolina on 09-May-2018 for US$2,75 sampled exactly a month later at home in Washington on 09-June-2018."

Sornin Castagne Ambrée;Pouilly-Sous-Charlieu, France;Flavored - Other;Les Brasseurs du Sornin;La cave a boules, paris bottle: pours dull amber with disappearing head. I havent taken a sip and already it looks like dark cider. Aroma as far as I can tell is mostly candied sugar. Taste is pretty sweet, but with a nice yeasty tang to it.

Magic Hat Batch 372 (Scottish Ale);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Very dark coloured body with a brown tint when on an angle. Small tan head with some bubbles rising from the bottom. Aroma of fresh hops, roasted malt, strong peanuts and some light nutmeg. Medium-bodied; Super strong nuttiness throughout with some malt and a funky vegetable taste all the way. Aftertaste shows more of the peanut bitterness with a bunch of spices and a bad taste in the palate. Overall, a strong nut brown that has been dry hopped and some light other flavours. Overall, not a great beer...they really shouldn’t make this batch again - try something new! I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased in a sampler twelve pack from Harris Teeter in Pentagon City (Arlington), Virginia on 08-April-2006."
Magic Hat Batch 372 (Scottish Ale);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz bottle poured deep brownish amber color with a long lasting tan head. Scent of sweet biscuits with a hint of cocoa. A very thin flavor of sweet malts and hops that did not come together well.
Magic Hat Batch 372 (Scottish Ale);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Medium brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of nuts and caramel, with a moderately strong hops presense for the style. Flavor is earthy at first, roasty in the middle, and a healthy citrusy hops kick in the finsih. Kind of like a APA/Scotch Ale/Porter mix. I’m not sure that is a good thing...
Magic Hat Batch 372 (Scottish Ale);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Notes: Pours a deep-hued brown with a magnificent looking head. Smells malty, raisins, grapefruit; pretty fragrant but maybe a little too much in the nose. Taste jumps all over the place... Grapefruit at the beginning, roasted coffee at the end. Really weird and unappetizing. Very hard to swallow, had to pour some of it out because I couldn’t finish it. It was OK on the first sip, but got really bad on subsequent sips."
Magic Hat Batch 372 (Scottish Ale);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This was very good. Wanted to name it. I think it was broken oak or log tosser. But they didnt go for it. oh well. Good batch.
Magic Hat Batch 372 (Scottish Ale);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz bottle via trade with 46er3498 - Thanks Tom! - Pours brown with a short tan head that fades pretty quick. Aromas of light caramel and some smoke. Flavor is a blend of caramel, smoke, a little oak, and some light alcohol on the finish. Medium body without much carbonation. Pretty smooth and easy to drink. Not bad but nothing special
Magic Hat Batch 372 (Scottish Ale);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Reminds me of Jinx. Smokey ending complements easy of drinking. Nothing too special. Almost a mix of Jinx and 373. See Factory description; Decent."
Magic Hat Batch 372 (Scottish Ale);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Batch 372 appears to be a nut brown. Aromas are of roasted malts and cobwebs, as well as a hint of alcohol, although we’re not quite sure what the ABV is here. It pours an amber/brown color, muddy appearance, with a frothy, light-brown head. Initial flavor is lightly acidic with a light bitter finish. Short duration on the mouth. Light to medium body, there’s a watery feel left behind with hardly any carbonation and a slightly chalky feel.
Magic Hat Batch 372 (Scottish Ale);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Poured a dark brown color with the typical mahoganey edges and a nice initial head. The head subsided and provided ok lacing. The aroma was smokey, rich in malts, with somewhat of an off smell (couldn’t place it). Flavor was comparable to the aroma with a rather thin mouthfeel and somewhat of a charred wood flavor. I’m unmoved by this, definitely not impressed, but not disturbed by it. Within style, much better out there.
Magic Hat Batch 372 (Scottish Ale);South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Scottish Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Toasted malt aroma seems a little off....Some nice flavors, but a metallic taste sticks out. Chocolate malt and some slight fruit and hops. Has a nice mellow chocolate finish, but I don’t like how agressively off it tastes to begin.
Town Hall Irish Coffee Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On-tap at the brewpub: Super dark brown nearly black in color, thin light tan cap, lacing in small and short sheeting leaving some bigger globs as it breaks up. Aroma is the equivalent of coffee ice cream topped with milk chocolate sauce. Not overly strong, quite welcoming, clean, and delightful to wiff in. Flavors of iced coffee and smooth milk chocolate decorate the entire palate. Smooth and inviting, mixing favorably without any hint to whether the coffee or chocolate is stronger. Always equally distributed between the two. The chocolate keeps a sweeter edge while the coffee drys it out. Great balance. Feel is about medium with a mega soft smoothness and nice drying tones mixed with sweetness. A very nice porter here, the flavors aren’t huge, its got just enough flavor and body to create a finely smooth semi-mild treat. Fantastic balance and nearly perfect flavors, I was hoping for just a nudge more coffee, but it’s still a wonderful porter that any lover of porters would enjoy.
Town Hall Irish Coffee Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Barrel Draught from the jug at the GABF, Colorado Convention Center 01/10/2005 Dark coloured and slightly rich on the palate with a fruit aroma. Smooth coffee roast flavour finish.
Town Hall Irish Coffee Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;I’m not sure if this was supposed to resemble Irish coffee or if it’s a dry/Irish style porter - whatever that would be. I don’t know - more confusion because someone tried to be creative with the name. This has a dark tan and brown head with a deep black body. Robust and creamy nose of milk chocolate and ice cream, with some rich fudge and coffee notes as well - a very striking and unique aroma. Silky and smooth on the tongue - very sweet ice cream texture, robust and deep, like French roast coffee. I want more.
Town Hall Irish Coffee Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;GABF 2005 Aroma: coffee, cream, milk, some coco/chocolate, molasses Appearance: dark brown, tan head, lacing Flavor: brown sugar, coco, coffee, some light cream, and bourbon Palate: smooth, creamy with dry bite
Town Hall Irish Coffee Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;GABF 2005: Nearly opaque with a small light brown head. The aroma is that of coffee, milk chocolate, roasted malt, and light lactic twang. The flavor is straight up standard porter with the expected nutty and smoky finish that followed a light mocha and coffee taste. The feel was good for the style, silky and medium-bodied. Overall, nicely drinkable.
Shady Grove Wolf Valley Pear Mead;Lake City, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Shady Grove Meadery;750ml. Lightly hazy topaz with some gentle bubbling in the glass. Aroma of pear, musty grape, vanilla, honey and earthy beeswax. Flavors are similar plus some vinous alcohol notes. Light-medium body is tingly, warming and lightly dry on the finish.
Shady Grove Wolf Valley Pear Mead;Lake City, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Shady Grove Meadery;Clear effervescent yellow with a quick white fizz. Aroma is lightly flora, quite vinuous, with alcohol hints, pears peek over all of that. Taste is dry, big florals, some sweet pear is there in the finish but muddled with the alcohol bite.
Shady Grove Wolf Valley Pear Mead;Lake City, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Shady Grove Meadery;"Bottle. Pours a pale straw color with good sparkling carbonation and quickly falling legs. The aroma is quite vinous, with a lot of floral honey tones as well; also some alcohol and cidery notes. The flavor is like a very dry perry, with honey coming out toward the finish. Some bitter floral notes emerge throughout. Fuzzy mouthfeel."
Shady Grove Wolf Valley Pear Mead;Lake City, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Shady Grove Meadery;Bottle split with Tronraner and friends. Pours a very light golden color with noticeable carbonation and a small, fizzy head even. This mead smells much more vinous than Shady Grove’s other offerings. There is faint pear, but mostly hints of a dark fruit boquet. The honey is very subdued in the nose. This brings a thin, drying palate, especially for a mead. Again, less honey is noticed here than in their other meads. That is a statement given Shady Grove’s very subtle offerings. It’s quite tart overall and hints at vanilla and more pear than the scent would have me believe.
Shady Grove Wolf Valley Pear Mead;Lake City, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Shady Grove Meadery;Brewer’s reception Knoxville Brewer’s Jam. Most of my meads have been homebrews so that’s what I have to compare this to. Light yellow and lacked any sparkle. Slight cloudiness. A little pear aroma, but overall the aroma just wasn’t there. Thin palate delivers a slightly fruity, wine like medicinal taste. Too young perhaps?
Shady Grove Wolf Valley Pear Mead;Lake City, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Shady Grove Meadery;Pale yellow with a gentle carbonation. No Head. Faint aroma of pear and honey (surprise). First sip is pear, then a rather unpleasent flavor of, I don’t know, cough medicine, maybe? The whole thing seemed discombobulated somehow. And this is the first ime I’ve thought a mead could’ve used MORE honey character.
Clockwork Plum Ale;Glasgow, Scotland;Flavored - Fruit;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);[cask at clockwork] Lots of plum in the aroma as you would expect, not much else. Body is light and pleasant, finish is sweet. One dimensional and too sweet, but not altogether unpleasant.

Pandúr Svetlé Vyèapné 10%;Vyhne, Slovakia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Steiger;500 ml bottle. Brewed by Pivovar Steiger for Tesco. From Liptovský Mikuláš, Slovakia. Clear golden colour with small white head. Sweet malt, lots of diacetyl and/is buttery sweetness in aroma. Grassy hops, metal, sweet malt and mild diacetyl. Diacetyl is not as disturbing in flavour as in aroma. Almost drinkable Pilsener.
Pandúr Svetlé Vyèapné 10%;Vyhne, Slovakia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Steiger;Rough, grainy aroma, hops yes, but husky barley, maybe. But the aroma is a gem compared to the watery, sugary, bready mess of a flavor this beer has. Ugh. Very slight bitterness creeps in late, and the palate isn’t all that sticky! Ugh.

Then that taste, which was alright, it was stuffed with ingredients surely. Not watery, but has an aggressive taste, that disappears right after a dew seconds. Ir's not bad beer, but strange.
Dobré Pifko 12%;Hurbanovo, Slovakia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Heineken Slovensko;From tap at 1. Slovak Pub, Bratislava. Golden color with small white head. Weak aroma of malt. Taste, malty with fruity hints. Light bitter finish. Overall little bit watery beer.

Dobré Pifko 12%;Hurbanovo, Slovakia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Heineken Slovensko;Draught at 1st Slovak Pub. Metallic aroma. Clear dark golden colour. Quite stable off-white head. The flavour has a little malt and some rough hoppiness. Like the 10, this is probably an alias of some macro lager.

I had to agree. Nice smoky notes, but no balance. No malty bass notes to play off of the bitter, smoky aftertaste. One dimensional."
Brooklyn Smoked Porter;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Tap at the Blind Tiger VSK event. Deep dark black beer. Aroma is loaded with smoke and ash. Deep cherry character with a lot of light fruitiness as well. Pretty solid flavour, rich smokiness with a touch of tartness. Smoky and chewy, but the smoke has a different quality than most other smoked beer. Chewy palate... really damn tasty.
Brooklyn Smoked Porter;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Tap at the Blind Tiger for VSK, 2005 keg. Very chocolatey, rich, great smoke. Surprisingly pungent considering its age. Chalky with great roast, cappuccino flavors. Reminds me of Valentines Day. Very dry smoke, not hammy at all like most American smoked beers. A solid offering. Must have been fantastic fresh.
Brooklyn Smoked Porter;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);2005 Version on Tap at Blind Tiger VSK 2008: Pours a very deep brown with a tan ring of head. Aroma has some smokiness, leaning towards sweet peat and roasted chocolate malt notes. Average carbonation. The flavor is slightly smoky with chocolate malt notes accompanied by a sour dough note in there. Sweet peat and cocoa roasted flavor come through into the finish. Has held up well over three years, showing little age, it just needs more smoke!
Brooklyn Smoked Porter;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Draught at The Gate. Minimal tan head atop the usual dark brown-black body. Dark coffee and chocolate aromas with fairly substantial infusion of campfire smokiness in the nose. Flavor much less chocolate than dark roast, almost charred, coffee with a woody smoke which brings it to a meaty/bacon finish. Smooth mouthfeel with fine carmonation. Another nice one from the Brewmaster seiries.
Brooklyn Smoked Porter;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);On tap at Blue Dog Pub. Pours a deep black with a medium size dark bubbly tan head. Aroma of caramel, butterscotch and hints of smoke. Flavor of milk chocolate, light campfire smoke, caramel, hints of coffee, interesting mix of smoke, sweet malts and chocolate.

Brooklyn Smoked Porter;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);On tap. Poured a dark brown color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of light smoke, chocolate, and vanilla. Tastes of smoke, chocolate, light roast and vanilla. Although the body was on the thin side, I found it nice and smooth. I would have preferred the smoke piece to be a little stronger.
Brooklyn Smoked Porter;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Dark brown pour with a medium and tight beige head. Strong coffee aroma with notes of vanilla, roasted malt, melting chocolate and only mild smoke. Sweet but balanced flavors of milk chocolate, toffee, coffee, and deeply roasted malt all enveloped by a thin veil of smoke. Mouthfeel is silky and the finish is refreshing. This is a well-crafted porter which I would buy fairly often if Brooklyn ever decided to offer it in bottles.
Church Brew Burly Friar Barley Wine;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Church Brew Works;Buy a whiskey. This is so oaked, any real play by the Barley wine is lost, dark amber wth no head at all, it is what it says it is, but just not my taste. Sweet dried fruit, port wine finish but just barely.
Church Brew Burly Friar Barley Wine;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Church Brew Works;On tap as the oak aged version at the brewery. 2007 version according to the bartender. Pours a deep, amber-brown colored body with a thin, creamy, light brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is mainly oak and minimal elsewhere. Some cherry port and earth, but fairly mute overall and a bit metallic. Flavor is better, but still tastes watered down. More cherry caramel with some metallic earth, chocolate, oak, and a pinch of vanilla before this dries with a woody bitterness. Leaves a moderate aftertaste after a medium, smooth body with a very light carbonation. Overall, not a bad tasting barley wine, just fairly bland, metallic, and unexciting. The oak is nice and I like the dry finish, but it lacks a punch. Eh...
Church Brew Burly Friar Barley Wine;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Church Brew Works;This was oak aged at the brewery. Nice oak flavor. Very dark with a small head. Fruity aroma and taste. Hidden kick.
Church Brew Burly Friar Barley Wine;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Church Brew Works;Growler from goryshkewych, thanks George. Super dark pour, pitch black, never seen a barley wine this dark, had very thin tan head as well. Different aroma, sweet, almost like smelling grape kool aid, very floral as well. Flavor is slightly sweet, some good maltiness with a touch of hop bitterness in there with just a hint of alcohol in the finish. A bit thin, not as full bodied as I would like, overall a pretty good barley wine though.
Church Brew Burly Friar Barley Wine;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Church Brew Works;Blah. A horrific barley wine. Aroma was next to nothing. Pretty much just metal with a hint of alcohol. Pour was a nice deep dark brown (darker than most BWs) with swirling bubbles and a thin off white film for a head. Taste was very weak and thin. Mostly stale alcohol with hints of roasted malt and some kind of weird fruitiness. No carbonation whatsoever and a flat but wet aftertaste. Board says the OG was 1.095...can’t see how that can be right with how thin and watery this beer was.
Church Brew Burly Friar Barley Wine;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Church Brew Works;Snifter from oak chip cask. Pours thick and dark, with a thick lingering white head. Smells sweet and boozey, like a good port/sherry mix. Hints of cherry and deep red fruits. Big and boozy on the tongue with hints of dark chocolate and tropical fruits. Thick clingy palate...hits you quick.
Church Brew Burly Friar Barley Wine;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Church Brew Works;Draft at brewpub. Dark brown body, smallish head, malty nose. This had some chocolate notes, with spiciness. Not usual for the style, but decent.
Church Brew Burly Friar Barley Wine;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Church Brew Works;Draught at Pizza Plant, Williamsville, N.Y. 2005 Vintage. Pours a clear golden-orange with a small diminishing off-white head. Aroma has a nice amount of hoppiness to it along with caramel malt in the back -- a bit mild for the style but pleasant. Flavour’s also a touch mild but still quite nice, and you’d never know this was 10%. Plenty of hops backed by caramel malt along with fruit and a dry, bitter finish. Medium bodied. Pretty good but the most impressive aspect of this beer is how easy it goes down, dangerously so.
Church Brew Burly Friar Barley Wine;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Church Brew Works;Draught. At Pizza Plant (Walker) in Williamsville. 2005 vintage, according to the board. Clear walnut-amber pour with a small drizzle of off-white head. Good balanced aroma, appleseed bitterness, caramel malt, strong alcohol and a fair bit of light fruit. Very dry taste, more bitterness than malt, fruit a mild dry woody notes in the finish, quite pleasantly boozy throughout. Quite a light, slick, astringent body, and while it had obviously smoothed out and blended well, my impression was another year or two would make it even better.
Church Brew Burly Friar Barley Wine;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Church Brew Works;sampled at kelly’s hell with the lid off 2008. pours a hazy mahogany with virtually no head. scent of rotting vegetables, alcohol, and some citrus hops. tastes surprisingly better, with a decent caramel malt flavor coming out over ok and sour fruit notes. finishes quite tart, which i rather enjoyed even though it seemed to be accidental. medium body, sticky mouthfeel, light carbonation. i rather think this had something wrong with it.

Viper Ales Snake In The Grass;Ingatestone, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Viper Ales;Cask (gravity dispense) at St Albans Beer festival, October 2005. This was billed as Mighty Oak Snake In The Grass, presumably in line with CAMRA’s (quite correct) policy that badge beers should be listed under the brewer, not the commissioner. There was also some debate as to whether this was the same beer as Viper Ales Jake The Snake. The consensus seems to be 2-1 in favour of a separate listing, so I’ll go with the majority. The beer? That was golden brown, grassy, dry but a little dull. But the condition wasn’t all it could have been with some of the beers at this festival, so I’ve made some allowances.
Viper Ales Snake In The Grass;Ingatestone, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Viper Ales;Cask @ St Albans 05: Golden colour. Mild citric grassy aroma. Sweetish grainy start, citric finish. Drinkable, but just another golden ale.
Viper Ales Snake In The Grass;Ingatestone, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Viper Ales;Cask@St Albans Beer Festival. Quite nice. Clean, slightly grainy mouthfeel, with a citrusy hops character, definitely a touch of grapefruit in here, pleasant, but not over the top.
Bank Top Sir Gareth;Bolton, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bank Top Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Bar Fringe, Manchester 21/09/2005 Amber golden coloured fruity beer with some slight sourness. Dry wheaty slightly bitter finish.
Bank Top Sir Gareth;Bolton, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bank Top Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) at St Albans Beer festival, October 2005. A fairly standard copper coloured best bitter, with a touch of dry malt and some citric edges. Pleasant enough, solid but unspectacular, fare.
Bank Top Sir Gareth;Bolton, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bank Top Brewery;Cask@St Albans Beer Festival. Not too bad. Cereally malt, a little crackery. Some citric hops in the finish, quite decent.
Toll End William Perry;Tipton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Toll End;Cask at the Waggon & Horses, Tipton. Pours gold with a small head. Aroma is straw malt. Taste is straw throughout with a touch of vanilla and yeast.
Toll End William Perry;Tipton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Toll End;Cask@lychgatetavern, Wolverhampton. Amber beer with medium creamy head. A little malt aroma. Taste was peat smoke, reminded me of a Lagavulin 16 year old. It seems this may have been an errant barrel as I don’t remember it tasting like this before nor does it match the other reviews. It has been suggested it could be the yeast producing off flavours. However it tasted very good despite this.
Toll End William Perry;Tipton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Toll End;Cask,hand pulled at Coombs Wood Sports Club,Halesowen.17th march.Amber gold pour with medium sized whitish head.Light aroma of fruit and malt.Taste of caramel,fruit and hop.Average tasting session ale.

Toll End William Perry;Tipton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Toll End;Cask conditioned at The Turf Tavern, Oxford Spring Beer Fest 09. Gold amber with white head. Overbearingly full of toffee caramel flavours, butterscotch that we thought it had come from a confectionery counte, as paul put it, not sure if this came from the Waggon or the Horse. Dull, sweet beer, not good.
Toll End William Perry;Tipton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Toll End;St Albans (05): Hazy dark golden colour. Fruity aroma. Mildly hoppy flavour. Pretty boring.
Toll End William Perry;Tipton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Toll End;Cask (gravity dispense) at St Albans Beer Festival, October 2005. An amber coloured best bitter. Fruity, appley aroma. Some citric hops on the palate. Nothing exceptional, but pleasant enough.
Toll End William Perry;Tipton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Toll End;Cask@St Albans beer Festival. Malty (kind of cereally, wholemeal), sweetish, with a touch of green citric hops in the finish, pretty broing though.
Elysian Saison de Tamarin;Seattle, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Mild oaky aroma is lightly spicy with haylike character and some citrus. Hazy dark golden body is topped by a fizzy off white head that recedes to ring. Citrusy lemon flavour is rather tart with haylike hops and some caramel malt apparent. Some dough like yeast lasts in the finish. Light body is quite thin with sharp, pointy carbonation that prickles the tongue. Sampled at GABF 2005.
Elysian Saison de Tamarin;Seattle, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Lasting off-white head covers the dark straw hue. Gentle spicy nose, not so aromatic, but lightly lemony, leary, cerealic. Sprucey hops bring more tartness than good sense would recommend. Light-medium bodied, flatish texture, not very bitter at all. You need more attenuation and hop confidence to make a good saison. Here we have a tannic, tea-like very spicy version (nuts, cumin, salt, pepper)

Hogs Back St Georges Day Ale;Tongham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hogs Back Brewery;Cask@The Coastguard (Phil_L’s pub), near Dover, Kent. Well, it was in good condition, but i just didn’t get along with it, as with a lot of Hogs Backs beers. Sweet, flat mouthfeel, raw, slightly boiled vegetable type malt characters. i stuck to the Grainstore Ten-Fifty for the rest of the night!

Tring Hayabouts First;Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tring Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) at St Albans Beer Festival, October 2005. More copper colour than golden, I’d say. Some diacetyl in the aroma. Otherwise, a best bitter at the lighter end of the spectrum with some earthy English hops. Not terribly distinctive.

Cobra Light;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cobra Beer (Molson Coors);Bottle I didn’t expect much from this, and I didn’t get much, either. Thin, pale, watery beer, a watered down version of a beer that didn’t have much taste in the first place. Have a glass of water instead.
Cobra Light;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cobra Beer (Molson Coors);Bottle from morrisons. Alround rating: Seems like its higher carbonated than ordinary cobra, very thin and quite sweet, cornish grainy malts, not much sign of hops. Not a good effort.
Cobra Light;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cobra Beer (Molson Coors);330ml clear bottle from Tesco. Dried dog poo, dirty straw and iron railings in the rain aroma. Carbonation forms a short lived hissing and popping head, then backs off to a gentle - though still insistent and nipping - fizz. Tastes very clean. I’ve had water with more character and flavour. Reasonably dry. There’s little that’s actually offensive about the beer. But there’s little that’s attractive either. Some dirty citric notes. It’s got that unwashed feel that rice beers such as Bud have. I don’t really like it, but it doesn’t repulse me - as it doesn’t quite have enough character for that!
Cobra Light;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cobra Beer (Molson Coors);As Cobra Light, 4.1% (how can you make something that’s already weightless lighter?). Mexican looks. Trace of lemon aroma. Wet. Gold. Squeaky clean. Rice, white bread and rubber. Clinging sweet bready aftertaste. Doesn’t annoy me like I’d planned. Sometimes a brainless, rice-flavoured beer just hits the spot.
Cobra Light;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cobra Beer (Molson Coors);Bottle from Morrisons. My version was badged as Cobra Light at 4.1%. Appearance is pale gold with no head and low carbonation. Aromas are corn with muddled sweet citrus. Flavours are very thin grain and corn with metallic notes. Not very dry on the finish. Would be OK to douse the heat of a hot curry - and that’s all.
Cobra Light;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cobra Beer (Molson Coors);03.06.2006, 0,33l bottle. Very light beer from India/England. Colour is yellow. Texture is thin and the beer smells of grass.
Cobra Light;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cobra Beer (Molson Coors);Bottled, pasteurised, 330ml from Tesco. Yellow with slight head. Corny, maize aroma into a sweet sticky, cardboardy body. Luckily I almost froze it, so I wasn’t looking for character as there was non to be found. A pop beer, but reasonable with spicy food.

Fuller's Trafalgar;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);A Mes rate: Cask at The Head Of Steam, Euston. Hoppy and dry with biscuit notes. Nose is very faint. Earthy almost manure type notes to the flavour. Nothing special.
Fuller's Trafalgar;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);(Cask, The Wharf, Aalborg) - Amber colour. Roasty, caramel nose. The taste is pretty soft, with a unmistakeable molasses stickyness, and a slightly dry fruity finish.

Active carbonation in yellow body.Definatey a reformulation.
Rocky River Blitzkrieg Alt-Fest;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Glowing amber color with a sticky head and lots of lace. Very big floral hoppy nose with some notes of dark fruit. Chewy malts to start with a nice slick oily hop presense, turning dry on the finish. Like a blend of an alt and an american IPA. Quite tasty.
Rocky River Blitzkrieg Alt-Fest;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Appears an amber brown with a nice sized off white head that holds nice retention. Nice sticky lacing is left on the inside of the glass. Smell is bittersweet with a toffee like malt, and a nice fruitiness. The taste is of the same aromas. Mouthfeel is crisp, slightly sweet, sour, and bitter. Not too shabby.
Rocky River Plutonium Pilsner;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);On tap at brewery in Cleveland. OK beer.

(OH);On tap at the brewpub on 6/28/06 - Pours pale golden with a short white head that stayed pretty well and laced the sides of the glass. Nice aroma of noble and saaz hops over light grains. Flavor is delightfully sweet and grainy with a good crisp clean finish. Tasty and refreshing!
Rocky River Plutonium Pilsner;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);vibrant gold color with a fluffy, sticky head. Great fresh noble hop nose really smacks you right upside the olifactory gland! There are some plesant malty notes along with a little touch of sulphur. Light body with the slightly sweet maltiness and clean, bitter hop finish. Very nice interpretation of the style. Now, where’s my growler....
Rocky River Plutonium Pilsner;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);On tap @ Rocky RIver: Medium gold, very clear, w/a lasting, huge, fluffy, white head. Strong floral Saaz aroma w/ a spicy hop backdrop. Some lightly grainy & munich malt aroma, clean of fruitiness, and only hints of sulphury yeast. Starts a bit sweet, but turns decidedly bitter in balance, but soft & pleasant, not harsh or resiny. Soft malt of both Munich and grainy (more Munich) and clean herbal and spicy hop flavors, but is slightly dominated by hop flavors. Clean finish, aftertaste is herbal and spicy hops that is lingering. Highly carbonated and smooth body that is lighter medium. Overall a very nice, refreshing, and well done for a delicate style. I enjoyed this one with Aaron and his wife Kathy, and Matt Cole, thank you to all that made this beer experience that much more enjoyable!

Main Street Belgian Sour Red;Gresham, Oregon, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Main Street Ale House;GABF 2005. Body is dark yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly yeasty (barnyard), with notes of wood and sour apple. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, unclean. Light to medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. Though the aroma seemed somewhat promising (in a very spartan way, i.e. with its heart in the right place but lacking in charisma), the flavor was quite off to my taste buds. A long way from the La Folies and Panil Barriquees of the world, but it’s always cool to see American breweries giving it a go.
Main Street Belgian Sour Red;Gresham, Oregon, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Main Street Ale House;Deep amber pour, headless. Slightly metallic sweettarts nose, candyish in nature, but with underlying yogurty acidity. Balsamic influenced leafy and bready undertones, hinting at sweet tea and lively cherries. Thin palate with biting carbonation feels a bit sharp and artificial, thus pushing the metallic aspect further than would be preferable. Still a nice try and minor tweakings could make this very good for the lover of the style that I am.
Main Street Belgian Sour Red;Gresham, Oregon, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Main Street Ale House;Very light brown no real head. lactose and sour cherries aroma lightly sweet too.

Main Street Barley Wine;Gresham, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Main Street Ale House;Labeled as 4th Street Brewing. Tap @ Horse Brass... Poured ruby/burgundy with a frothy, off-white head. Aroma of toffee and burnt malt with a little bit of floral hops. Foamy palate. Flavors were a little too hoppy and almost acted like an I-IPA rather than a Barley Wine. Lot of bready malt notes but lacked the sweeter, fruit notes your expect from a Barley Wine style. Perhaps of it has been allowed to mature for a bit.
Main Street Barley Wine;Gresham, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Main Street Ale House;4 year old version on tap at PDX Green Dragon. Pours amber with a smooth white head. This aged perfectly, smooth caramel flavors up front with still enough hops to keep it from being cloying but let the malt complexity shine through. The flavors have melded beautifully over time, giving a soft and chewy caramel palate, hints of cherry and soft sweeter chocolate notes in the finish.
Main Street Barley Wine;Gresham, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Main Street Ale House;On tap at Green Dragon in Portland, OR--This four year aged barley had a deep sticky mahogany-orange body with a mild whitish head. Sugary, caramel, hoppy, sticky chew nose. Body much the same. Subtle yet bold booziness and fruity, not so cloying beer with a emboldened malt spine. Very enjoyable!
Main Street Barley Wine;Gresham, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Main Street Ale House;copper brown color small well laced tan head. Sweet brown sugar carmel and toffee aroma. Palate is well coated and lightly creamy. Syruppy flavor brown sugar & raisens but finishes w/ a dry hop. A fairly basic BW but not bad.
Rocky River Mexicali Smoke;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);On Tap @ Buckeye Brewing: Pours hazy chestnut w/ a lasting beige head. Amromas of Munich malt, smoky malt, and a hint of chipotle pepper aroma. Clean, malty. Flavor is well balance, but to malt, w/a nice chipotle pepper flavor that is a nice compliment to the malt and does not overpower. A bit of peppery heat follows, but remains subdued. Munich malt and smokey flavors as well. Clean, overall malty flavor. Medium body, medium carbonation, smooth m/f. Very nice beer from Matt Cole. Experimental catergory winner @ GABF and a must try if it’s made again!
Rocky River Mexicali Smoke;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);GABF ’05. Pours dark brown with a curious aroma of... gingerbread? Yes, you read correctly. Anyways, flavor is faint chipotle with a smokey finish. Needs more chipotle and smoke, but it’s respectable.
Rocky River Mexicali Smoke;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Straight up wild. Hazy mahogany auburn body with a tan head. Wild aromas of spicy peppers, sweet malts and some smoke. Very chewy beer. Intense flavors from the peppers. Not really hot, but spicy. Complements the sweet-ish smoked bock very well. Gold medal winner in the experimental catagory at GABF2005.

Draught House Wilsons ESB;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Draught House Pub & Brewery;On cask at the brewpub. The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is what you would expect from an ESB. I get a lot of orange citrus notes, but it is very well balanced with the toffee malt. The flavor isn’t quite as fruity as the aroma. In addition to the strong toffee malt character, I get some grassy hops and a little bit of orange. Low bitterness and very easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. A nice, easy drinking ESB that at 5.9 percent ABV, you can drink more than one of.
Draught House Wilsons ESB;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Rich copper with a smallish white head. Sharp, hoppy aroma.

Aroma of biscuits, malt, and a slight note of toffee. Hits the mouth with light medium body, got a toffee laced malt, middle feels like it has honey in it, finish is bittering. Gone in 5 minutes with a smile, what does that tell you?
Draught House Wilsons ESB;Austin, Texas, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Rich Maroon amber color with a bit of off-white head, and lacing . Smell was a nice mix of hops, sweet honey like malt, and a touch of biscuity, yeast smell as it warmed. Taste was a good hop bitterness, but not excessive, with a nice touch of sweetness in the middle followed by a lasting mild bitterness. Fairly easy drinking and a decent beer all around. Worth a try if you like the style, for sure.

Stews Sportatorium Amber Ale;Carson City, Nevada, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Stews Sportatorium;Out of a keg at a company picnic in a plastic cap - A nice caramel color with a sizable foamy head. This beer reeks of malt and a bit of hops. Sweet and bitter with a caramel tang. This could use more hops - but still tasty. This and the porter are the brewery’s better ones.
Stews Sportatorium Amber Ale;Carson City, Nevada, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Stews Sportatorium;Draft- Amber color with an off-white head. The aroma tiped off the overly sweet flavors that lie ahead. Under attenuated and under hopped.

Belgia Lemons Beer;Kielce, Poland;Flavored - Fruit;Browar Kielce (Kompania Piwowarska - SABMiller);Rated: 04.08.2007 Can, 500 ml, 8.5 P Appearance: Head initially is average to small and disappears, no lacing, body is clear and flat, colour of body is flat, colour of body is piss yellowish. Generally poor appearance like quickly decarbonating fizzy drink. Aroma: Artificial lemon, lemon accid- shot citrusy aroma is strong and is killing the beer aroma. Almost no beer aroma, no malty, no hops, awful candy, landriness of citron or lemon flavour, lemon washing liquid Flavour: A hints of maltyness on palate are noticable in the aftertaste but mainly the whole flavuor is light beer mixed whit cheap lemonade. Generally the beer is far from ideal but is still one of the best fruit beers I’ve ever had so far. Finish duration is short, moderate sweet finish. Palate: Body is light, texture is wattery and a bit syroupy but watered, carbonation is flat. Finish fee is wattery and sweet. No bitterness characteristic for beer nor maltyness.
Belgia Lemons Beer;Kielce, Poland;Flavored - Fruit;Browar Kielce (Kompania Piwowarska - SABMiller);Can. Pours a pale yellow colour with a big bubbly rather short lasting white head. Lots of lime in the flavour with some sweetness. Flavour is sweet with some lime and not at all as sweet and sour as I suspected. Bit thin though and the finish is sweet and short with a little lime. Taste more like a refreshing soda than beer. Pretty good for a warm summer day at the beach.
Belgia Lemons Beer;Kielce, Poland;Flavored - Fruit;Browar Kielce (Kompania Piwowarska - SABMiller);Pale colour, bubbly disasspearing head. Tastes like Fanta mixed with beer, which still is quite good for that type - they usually taste just like Fanta. Nothing remarkable, but not terrible.

De Koninck Ambree (Cask);Antwerpen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Koninck (Duvel-Moortgat);Clear orange light amber color, little too light for an amber beer, creamy head. Not much smell. Overall pretty standard.
De Koninck Ambree (Cask);Antwerpen, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Koninck (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours deep amber with golden highlights and a finger of downy white head. A perfumed, floral nose gives little hint to the very malty beer beneath. A subtle rosemary character is given out along with a little banana skin. In the mouth, however, the hops step forward to give the beer an immediate bitterness, heading strangely into ESB territory. Finishes with a lasting marmalade malt and hop bitterness. It’s a bit odd really.

Arundel Sussex Gold (Bottle);Arundel, West Sussex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Arundel Brewery;500ml bottle: BBE Sep 2015, poured into a UK pint sleeve on 23 April 2015. The first beer in my St George’s Day tasting event (shared with no one). Orange hue to the clear light amber/old gold body, the head disappeared very, very swiftly. Hops in the nose and taste, some malty sweetness in the background. Orange flavours come through in the taste to add to the sweetness, ends with a dry, crisp finish.
Arundel Sussex Gold (Bottle);Arundel, West Sussex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Arundel Brewery;Hoppy apple-grass aroma. I’m looking forward to this one. With my taster sip I’m getting charcoal, green leaves and a clenched fist of citrus which is at odds with the aroma. A welcome surprise. I’m also now coughing because I’ve completely ballsed up oxeganting the ale in my mouth by breathing it in. As I make progress with my meal the metallic, smokey aftertaste seems to dominate rather disapointingly as I want more of the hoppy citrus. Texture is creamy and smooth.

Shandy Rock;Athens, Greece;Radler / Shandy;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Look like a lemonade taste like a lemonade. A very bad fruit beer. Thank god is retired.
Shandy Rock;Athens, Greece;Radler / Shandy;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Die Dose ist sehr bunt und auf Teenager ausgerichtet, sie sieht aus wie eine Limonadendose. Das Biermischgetränk existiert seit 2005. Geruch zitronig, süß, wie ein normales Radler. Das Bier schmeckt überaus zitronig, an Süßstoff oder Zuckerzusätzen ist hier bestimmt einiges drin denn es schmeckt wirlich sehr süß. Dabei ist ein merkwürdig chemisches Aroma im Hintergrund deutlich zu erschmecken, der das Bier irgendwie alt und verdorben wirken lässt. Der Nachgeschmack wirkt sehr trocken. Bier ist nicht im Geringsten zu erkennen. Kann man sich sparen. Test vom 4.8.2006, Gebinde: Dose Noten: 9,4,8,3,5,4 - 5,00
Shandy Rock;Athens, Greece;Radler / Shandy;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Its yellow colour and its bottle appearance may make you think its a lemonade. And that’s exactly what it is actually!!!
Shandy Rock;Athens, Greece;Radler / Shandy;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);Come on, it’s not that bad. A surprisingly inviting waft of geranium leafiness, ganja-ish mandarin, citrus. Smells alright, but tastes excruciatingly sugary. A trace of doughy malt? No, it’s all sugar, chemicals, lemon. But has no pretensions of being a great beer. Inoffensive, naturally-tasing alcopop more Sprite than lager.
Shandy Rock;Athens, Greece;Radler / Shandy;Athenian Brewery (Heineken);It’s supposed to be a refreshing drink for the summer. Even the worst beer chilled is better than this for a hot day. Avoid at all costs !

Beer Hunters Mufloni Stout;Pori, Finland;Stout;Panimoravintola Beer Hunter's;Draught @ Villi Wäinö. Rated on 31.10.2009 Aroma is somewhat sour with earthy notes, roastiness and hints of coffee. Flavour is quite sour and somewhat tart with earthy notes, fruitiness, some roasted notes and ash. Usually the sourness and roastiness do not mix well, but in this beer that combination does not disturb. I bet the sourness is not intentional however.

Pours a hazy dark amber with golden brown highlights. Dense creamy tan head that falls quickly away. Delectable fresh pine nose. Creamy medium body with lively carb. Toast, caramel, and a bit of pine on the mid palate. Watery vacant finish, or this would rate a bit higher.

Slightly metallic with pale malts in the aroma. Flavor is also very light and pale with notes of metal and slight hops. This was very light on flavor, but it is for a good cause. .
Puget Soundkeeper Clean Water Ale;Olympia, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fish Brewing Company/Leavenworth Beers;Had in the Seattle airport. A n alright light-hop aroma.

BM Svijetlo Pivo;Daruvar, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Pivovara Daruvar;1 l plastic bottle. Poured pale yellow body with smaller head. There have been insinuations this is the same thing as P-Super, so let’s see. Poured the same pale yellow with smaller short living head. Aroma is very faint, citrus hops with some malt. Flavor is however more interesting, actually I would say bit less watery. Also malty more than hoppy, being slightly sweet. Still plain of course. Finish is sweetish and bitterish at the very end. Another boring pale lager. Those two were not the same, this was a bit better but still have many similar things, ok it is the same brewery, but still it can be another batch, who can know.
BM Svijetlo Pivo;Daruvar, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Pivovara Daruvar;0.5l bottle courtesy of ozujsko (thanks!) Poured a really pale yellow colour (reminiscent of a Wit!), with a medium sized fluffy white head. The nose is sweet and malty. Not bad really. The taste is... watery, metallic, but with some weak but juicy lemony hoppiness (odd), weak and subdued grainy malt body. Very weak lemony/hoppy aftertaste. It’s not bad or offensive, but it’s yet another pale lager that really isn’t worth trying more than once. Now that I look at my P-Super review, I could swear that these two are the same beer (same alc. %. same number of calories, 12% malt extract, similar taste all go to prove my point). The same probably goes for Jurakovo Pivo too (but not for StaroÈeško). However, ozujsko claims otherwise, and I won’t rely solely on my opinion. This is a bit better however than I remember that other one being (in terms of consistency), so it gets a slightly bigger score.
BM Svijetlo Pivo;Daruvar, Croatia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Pivovara Daruvar;Bottled(500ml). -pale golden, almost no head, light faint hop aroma and that’s all that’s worth mentioning

Little Valley Withens Pale Ale;Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Little Valley Brewery;"Golden appearance. Quickly fading head. Not much aroma; possibly hay. Very discreet flavour and bitterness. Easy going but not much going on."
Little Valley Withens Pale Ale;Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Little Valley Brewery;500 ml bottle conditioned, from Det Gode Brygg, Kvadrat. ABV is 3.9%. Pale straw colour, slightly hazy. Moderate white head. Strong grassy aroma, also hints of sweetish fruits and herbal hops, a touch of vinegar. Light bodied, Citric and slightly acidic mouthfeel. Hoppy flavour, herbal and earthy notes, distinct bitterness in the finish, slightly metallic. Won't buy again.

Taste is medium sweet to bitter. Palate is light to medium bodied, thin oily texture and a bitter finish. As good as the lager I drank on holiday but not the welcome home I was hoping for.

Little Valley Withens Pale Ale;Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Little Valley Brewery;Really bland and pointless... tastes of near nothing at all and is a pretty insipid pale. Not a pleasurable drink at all. Not for ale drinkers.

Black Forest Smoked Cherry Dunkelweiss;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Black Forest Brew Haus;Enjoyed a half liter of this one on draught at the brewery in Farmingdale, NY. This beer has to be one on the most interesting and flavorful beers I have tried in quite some time. The brewing of a rauchbier/dunkelweizen with the addition of 120 lbs of cherry puree, might sound strange to some, but the combination really is magical. This beer pours to a murky, ruby red to burgundy color, with a rocky, white head, that fades, and a good carbonation. The nose on this beer is very interesting, with salty/sooty aroma of smoke, paired with estery fruity aromas of banana and pear, along with distinct, sweet/sour cherry aroma. The palate offers much of the same. Lots of salty/smoke flavor, caramel, and chocolate malt, with a wonderful sweet/sour cherry tartness, that gives this beer a very refreshing edge. This beer finishes with more flavors of smoke, estery pear/banana, chocolate and caramel malt up front, then ends with a refreshing sour cherry flavor that lingers. Really intersting, delicious beer, that is quite different than anything I have ever had before. The combination of wheat malts and cherry make this beer tart, thirst quenching and refreshing. The smoke works very well with the cherry and dark malts as well, giving this beer lots of complex aromas and flavors. Very unique, and well worth trying at the Brew Haus in Farmingdale. Enjoyed a growler of this one to take home as well.
Black Forest Smoked Cherry Dunkelweiss;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Black Forest Brew Haus;Cool. Thanks to Eugene (beastiefan) for sharing a growler of this at the Captain Lawrence RB gathering on Saturday. This was a very unique beer. Pours a dark brown, moslty cloudy with a thin white head. Aroma of nice smoked malts, meats, woody, with lots of traditional wheat character- banana and clove with hints of caramel and chocolate. Flavor was a bit lighter as was the mouthfeel- light chocolate, some fruits, cherry banana and apple- light smokeyniess, some campfire and smoked meats- highly carbonated and a light spritzy body. Pretty good overall.
Black Forest Smoked Cherry Dunkelweiss;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Black Forest Brew Haus;thanks to Eugene for sharing this at the Captain Lawrence RB gathering. Dark hazy brown. Aroma is lightly smoky, with fruit esters(banana) as well as cherries and chocolate. Taste is smoky chocolate, cherries, lightly tart throughout the taste. very interesting beer!
Black Forest Smoked Cherry Dunkelweiss;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Black Forest Brew Haus;"A very decent wheat beer...dark body with a thin head around the sides of the glass. The aroma is heavy with wheat and malts - not too much smokiness. Somewhat tart, but a nice pleasant essence of cherries compliments the wheatiness. Very easy to drink. It does kind of have a ""holiday"" feel in its character, but I can’t really place what it is."
Black Forest Smoked Cherry Dunkelweiss;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Black Forest Brew Haus;"Tap at the brewpub, and now from a growler - cloudy burgundy color, with small tan head - moderate smokiness in the aroma, coupled well with a woody character, creating a nice warm sensation, with touches of chocolate and cherries - no wheat character that I can detect - the flavor is initially tart, borderlining on sour, with the cherry flavor quite present - the cherries never really leave, but the tartness subsides, and a light, sweet chocolate flavor combines with the fruit and a light smokiness to create a kind of ""cozy christmas night by the fire"" kind of sensation - the beer thins out a bit in the finish, and the tartness comes back a tiny bit - quite an interesting brew."
Black Forest Smoked Cherry Dunkelweiss;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Black Forest Brew Haus;Tap at brewpub. Poured into a pint glass, a very murky brown color. Almost no clarity and just a bit of light at the bottom. First wiff in the aroma is smokiness. Nicely present. Then a slightly tarty fruit sweetness. Taste is strong on the tarty cherries with a slight smokey flavor on the back end. A nice criss cross with the aroma. Just a hint of chocolate as well. Low bitterness and leaves a tarty aftertaste. A slightly subdued carbonation. A slightly lighter body for a perfectly refreshing yet highly interesting treat.

Greene King Fireside (Bottle);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Bottle. Backlog rating from bottle collection and historic scoring. Source not recorded. No tasting notes kept, just rating.
Greene King Fireside (Bottle);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;From November 2008: Brown 500ml bottle poured into a Hoegaarden Grand Cru stemmed tulip glass (one and a half times). Tawny or light ruby red in colour, clear and clean. an off-white head sat on top, large at first, then a collar and wisp. Like some others, I found a Belgian Beer aroma at first, this did fall away somewhat but it was still evident right to the end of the drink. A maltiness took over as the main smell once the beer began to warm a little, still pleasant though. The beer tasted OK, not as rich or flavoursome as the aroma hinted at, but better than a lot of bottled UK stuff. The malt from the aroma was there as was a bit of citrus fruit and toffee. Watery in the mouthfeel and certainly not full bodied as mentioned on the labelling. I’d need a roaring fire and a glass of Port with this beer to make it into a Winter Warmer, but it is an OK beer and one of Greene Kings better products.
Greene King Fireside (Bottle);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;[Cask at Copa, Reading] Orange-brown with a moderate creamy head. Fairly thick mouthfeel with a slight fizz. Treacley malts, with some toffee, plums and autumn leaf mulch. Sweet, rather dull. Recognisably Greene King, unfortunately, but not as poor as some of theirs.
Greene King Fireside (Bottle);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;500ml clear glass bottle from Sainsbury’s. Caramel and barley sugar. Soapy. Malt flavour vanishes quickly, leaving a thin grease and old leather flavour in the mouth. Hmmmm. Not impressed at all.

Prairie Rock Oktoberfest;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Gold Coloring with White Skin. Sweet Caramel Malt Aroma, Sweet Mouthfeel with Light Hop Dry Ending. Nothing Exciting Here.
Prairie Rock Oktoberfest;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Lighter in color than most oktoberfests I have had. The nose was thin and quite wattery with just a hint of that lager kind of funk. The taste was again thin with just a bit of grains to it but again watery.
Prairie Rock Oktoberfest;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Light amber color with no head. No aroma. It somehow manages to have both a sweet and sour honey taste. What the heck is this trying to be? It’s not an Oktoberfest to be sure.

Mia and Pias Fresh Hop Ale;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;IPA;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;Tap at the Rose and Raindrop. Amber coloured beer, sweet tropical hop aroma. Sweet crystal malt make up a large portion of the grain bill as well. Flavour is quite sweet and malty as well. Crystal and caramel sweetness, light blackberry fruitiness, with more of tropical and citrusy hop flavour. Low bitterness. All the crystal makes this seem a bit unbalanced on the sweet side, but it’s still pretty tasty.
Mia and Pias Fresh Hop Ale;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;IPA;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;On tap at the Rose and Raindrop (a really cool place I must add) and this was the best beer I’ve had in 6 months. Great vibrant amber color with a nice frothy head. Aroma is amazingly herbal and hoppy--simliar to whiffing a fresh hop in the homebrew asile. Flavor is extremely clean and smooth...like a rush of pine trees and orange down to the gut. Body is medium and nice. This is a world class beer IMHO. Please try this if you get a chance...like a SN Harvest but better!
Old Capitol Bourbon Brown Ale;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Poured a dark brown with a fizzy head that left no lacing. I wasn’t expecting great head retention, but I hoped for a little more. Smell was pretty nice, you can definately smell bourbon in it with perhaps a little nuttiness from the brown ale beneath. Taste was alright, but it was almost like drinking a diluted bourbon. It wasn’t bad, I just felt it would have been better with a little less bourbon influence on it. I thought the mouthfeel was a little thin, but the carbonation levels were right on. Still it seemed to be lacking in some areas that could have definately brought this beer much higher. It’s still pretty drinkable and goes down pretty easy, but I was thinking it would be more of a sipping type beer as opposed to what it came out to be. I think a few slight improvements and they could really have a nice beer here, but then again, with Iowa’s laws they probably won’t be able to max out what they could with this one. Definitely worth trying.
Old Capitol Bourbon Brown Ale;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Draft sample at brewpub. Clear brown color with an average frothy brown head that diminished quickly and produced fair lacing. Moderate bourbon toasted malt aroma. Medium to full body with a sticky texture. Medium bourbon sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Heavy sweet brew.
Old Capitol Bourbon Brown Ale;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Draught at the brewpub. Clear dark brown color with thin off white head. First whiff was pretty unremarkable with only some brown sugar. The oak and bourbon aromas came out more as the beer warmed, but you can taste them right from the get-go. Moderately carbonated. Interesting beer.
Old Capitol Bourbon Brown Ale;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;This is the Farmer Brown ale aged in some bourbon casks. They has released this a couple times as a special edition firkin beer. Now it is a on tap. I realy like the brown and think that this aging compliments the aroma and taste in a subtle way. Poured a dark brown and ruby. The head is a light tan color. The aroma is a little oaky with vanilla and some light chocolate. The taste has oak and a little bit of dry cherries. There is also vanilla and some sweet caramel. Nice and smooth. Well done.
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch Mighty Brown;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Decent brown ale. Aroma of nuts and roasted malt. Pours asleep brown with a thin cream head. Bitter coffee finish.
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch Mighty Brown;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Minerally, malty smell. Taste is pretty much the same with some raisin in there. Too dry and minerally. Medium carbonation with some foam.
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch Mighty Brown;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Bottle from backlog notes.

Breckenridge 471 Small Batch Mighty Brown;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);On tap at the original brewpub. Pour is brown with a small tan head and great lacing. Huge butterscotch popcorn, caramel, toffee, bread, and peppers in the aroma. Taste is a giant butter bomb, goopy vanilla cake, caramel corn, and dark fruits. Medium body with soft carbonation. Giant butter bomb.
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch Mighty Brown;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);"22oz bottle, from Dilly Cafe. Probably a ""vintage"" bottle. $8. Shared with friends. Dark brown, near black color. Thin khaki head. No lace sticks. A lot of caramelly malt. lends a lot of sweet taste. Bigger roast character is nice, though. Significant dark fruit, more than expected. Sweeter taste, very light bitter. Little spicy bite in the finish. Alright, but it seems like age hasn’t done well for this. Bigger body, very light carbonation. Lightly sticky finish. Friends complained the body was too thin. Nice to try."
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch Mighty Brown;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Booze. Serious bourbon. Sour notes and booze. Not as roasty as one might expect and way more bourbon than you’d think. Decent yet a sipper. More than i expected but maybe too much. The palate isn’t big enough for the bourbon. It tends to over power rather than compliment.
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch Mighty Brown;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Pours a clear very dark brown. Some light gets through, but not much. Big full very light tan head. Nose has a vinous character. Delicious sweet dark toasted malt flavor that has a pleasant sourness to it that the nose indicated. There is also the presence of roasted nuts and dried dark fruit. Not a brown in a traditional English way, but certainly an interesting and enjoyable brew!
Breckenridge 471 Small Batch Mighty Brown;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Poured from a bomber. Mostly black. This has a strong bourbon smelll to it. Taste is sweet and thick with chocolate hints. The bourbon flavor overpowers

Breckenridge 471 Small Batch Mighty Brown;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Dark brown pour, off white fluffy head. A nice caramel malty aroma, and more in the taste with some chocolate flavor thrown in. A nice and enjoyable brown ale.
Scotch Irish Sgt. Majors Double IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;"[7301-20070304] Tap. Smells faintly like oil paint mixed with some very sweet fruit.

Scotch Irish Sgt. Majors Double IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;Thick, cloudy brown w/ a greenish hue & frothy tan foam. Big, fresh hoppy aroma of grapefruit w/ an earthy, herbal aspect & some apple-like sweetness. Juicy, sticky feel. Flavour is earthy & bitter w/ a peppery spiciness. The malt is there, but certainly takes a backseat to the hops.
Scotch Irish Sgt. Majors Double IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;Also listed as Sgt. Major Squared (on the soldier’s sash). Pours really, really cloudy muddy orange with a quick disipating light tan head. Loads of dirt and grapefruit. Sappy and cider-like. Hard to find any sweetness to mop up all the earth and hop. Nice to try but really difficult to get through. It was the only really adventurous beer at the cask festival.
Scotch Irish Sgt. Majors Double IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;cask. murky brown-orange with a sudsy off-white head. biscuit aroma with a fair share of hoppiness (that’s probably an understatement) and light yeast. lots of biscuit malt though the balance is mostly skewed towards the chewy leafy hops. citrusy and somewhat resiny and fruity. the finish is long, smooth, and bitter. I surely can’t believe this is 9.5% - it tastes more like 6%. That’s not to say that i’d drink a lot of this though. pretty good.
Scotch Irish Sgt. Majors Double IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;Volo Cask Days. Aroma is as hoppy as all get out! Cloudy, even murky brownish green, tiny custard head. Flavour is leafy whole hops, from the first sip to the last. Sticky, chewy, full bodied, not the least bit complex (no complaints) Amazing! Perry, I’m always impressed with Your Work!
Scotch Irish Sgt. Majors Double IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;Cask at Bar Volo’s Cask Days 2005. Pours a cloudy dark orange with a spare white head. Aroma was like a weird medicinal hop and nothing else (I don’t know what ’medicinal hop’ is but it’s what I wrote when I had it). The huge hop flavour is interesting and different but it’s not that enjoyable -- and I’m a huge hophead. It’s a nice try and an interesting failure but ultimately it was hard to drink.
Scotch Irish Sgt. Majors Double IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;Volo Cask Days 2005. I was really anticipating this one, as Perry at Scotch Irish is always ready to try something new for us beer geeks at various Ontario festivals (thank you Perry!). This one though was a massive disappointment - I’m tempted to rate higher based on reputation alone (and the fact the regular Sgt. was so damn good on cask) but I can’t - this was a beer that was not ready to go - a failed experiment. It looked the part, deep copper colour with a small head. Fresh hop aroma that was kind of weird - certainly very green. Mouthfeel was very full. First impression - very harsh. All alcohol and green hops and terribly unbalanced. As it warmed it became even more so. I know there is a good beer here to be made from the Sgt., and with a little more time I know Perry could do it, but this wasn’t great at all, a noble failed experiment. Good thing I had 4 tickets worth of regular Sgt. instead.
Scotch Irish Sgt. Majors Double IPA;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;Clean, intense hop aroma, fruity raspberry and sweet malts. Thick brew, hazy copper-brown with smallish head. Bitterness found its dominion, but its more citrus, grapefruit like (different than west coast monster IPAs are). Plenty of malt sweetens the deal, leaves sticky residue on lips. Juicy, full bodied ale . .
Battledown Saxon;Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Battledown Brewery;Cask conditioned at Stratford upon Avon Beer fest ’07. Clouded gold with no head. Not sure what happened with this one, it certainly hadn’t dropped properly. There was a fragrant, perfumed aroma which turned to a slightly sour flavour, rough hops with a chemical like body, maybe a little chalky. Not great, but drinkable.

Rock Bottom Chicago Anniversary Imperial;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Rock Bottom Chicago;Very clear, lightish yellow. Is this really an imperial pilsner as they claim? Dry, little dimensionality. Germany hoppiness, moderately bitter finish, fizzy tingly, very brewpub-ish. (on tap at brewpub on Labor Day weekend).
Rock Bottom Chicago Anniversary Imperial;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Rock Bottom Chicago;My idea of a good lager, hopped out the wazoo. Good looking, a golden yellow body with tight bubbling and a big frothy head. Nice lacing. It took a while for this beer to warm up enough so that I could enjoy the aroma of grapefruit, lemon zest, pine, and wildflowers. A bit of the sweet pale malt squeaks through in the flavor, but mostly it’s a pleasurably lop-sided hop bomb, with a huge wave of bitterness (to which some earthy and grassy elements have been added) from start to finish. A good IPL - Imperpial Pale Lager! Rock Bottom Chicago, Chicago, IL Earlier Rating: 12/4/2006 Total Score: 3.9 On tap at the brewpub as 11th Anniversary Imperial Pilsner and with an ABV of 6.8%, not the posted 8%. But I won’t dispute (although I feel the first posting for this year should have been entered as a new brew). This is not a Pilsener as named. This is not a European Strong Lager as posted. This is an IPL, an India Pale Lager. It pours a clear straw color with a creamy sustained head that laces in sheets. The aroma is seriously strong with the hops, delivering scents of grapefruit, pine, and lemon zest over a sweet bready malt. Forget the malts in the flavor. This is about some serious hop bitterness, solid PNW hop tastes chewing away at the tongue. The finish is a prolonged, sharp citric bitterness, a delight for this hop-head. The current menu description for this 6.8% lager reads thusly: Back by popular demand and to celebrate another year of good friends and great beer, this Pilsner is brewed with loads of German Pilsner malt and bigger loads of Pacific Northwest hops. A malty and straw-colored lager with aromas of citrus and tropical fruit. In other words, This is a new beer, people! ...but I’ve been slammed down on things like this before....

Rock Bottom Chicago Anniversary Imperial;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at the brewpub, pitcher shared with Drewbeerme watching the bears f’ up against San Diego. Too bad their football team is as good their beer. Yellow with large white creamy head. Aroma is a lot of pine hops, and I mean a lot. Flavor is also very piney, light sweet with a very clean finish. Medium to thin body and mild carbonation. Comparable to any American IPA out there, strange for a Pilsner, so hoppy, so good.

Rock Bottom Chicago Anniversary Imperial;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Rock Bottom Chicago;I agree with Cornfield...this is more of an IPL. This lager has very good qualities, a nice deep color with great aromatic hop scents. The grapefruit smell and lemon seem to combine perfectly with the malt counterpart. This beer is full of PNW hops, I’m sure most comming from Cascade and Chinook hops. This beer bursts with hops, even in the aftertaste....great finish full of bitterness...makes you want another sip. Too bad you can only purchase off tap.

Rock Bottom Chicago Anniversary Imperial;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Rock Bottom Chicago;Draught at the brew pub. Clear gold color with a white head that laced the glass. Attractive aroma of citrusy hops with distinct grapefruit and lime accented by occasional whiffs of what I suppose are Saaz hops. Hop flavor is also prominent, again primarily citrusy. There is also a light hop bitterness that is well balanced by a fresh malty cereal grain flavor. Great beer.

McGuires Bock;Pensacola, Florida, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;McGuires Irish Pub & Brewery;Draft at Destin location: poured brownish red with a pretty good sized off white head. The aroma at first was somewhat chlorine filled but this may have something to do with the glassware rather than the beer. The chlorine aroma subsided after a few sips of beer, or perhaps I just got used to it. Mildly bitter flavor with hints of cocoa powder. Fairly thin body. Overall, not bad.

Huge thanks to Chris for bringing this one out of his cellar! BBE December 2005 - wow. Pours perfectly clear honey-gold with a creamy, white head; nothing wrong with the appearance, folks.

Bowen Island Strong;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Malt Liquor;Bear Brewing;Light malty aroma...not offensive to my suprise! At $5.99 per 6-pack this may be the cheapest priced 7% beer money can buy here in Alberta. Brewed by Big Rock this beer actually had some flavors althought it got skunkier by the sip. Overall I would say this is the best $1 per can beer money can buy.

For 7% inoffensive and smooth on the first sip but then the uneven sweetness and alcohol flavour overcome the blandness. Gets worse with each sip.
Grizzly Paw Jack OLantern Pumpkin Ale;Canmore, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Grizzly Paw Brewing Company;Appearance: clear medium amber with one finger of fluffy ivory head, good retention and patchy lacing. (3/5) Aroma: sweet pumpkin pie, floral, grassy. (6/10) Taste: moderate-high sweet, low bitter. (6/10) Medium body, moderate carbonation, sweet malty and spicy finish. (3/5) Yes, I know, another pumpkin beer. You take what you can get up here in the frozen north, OK? And supporting the local guys is important to me. On to the beer! I’ve had worse pumpkin beers, and I’ve had better. This isn’t subtle, by any means, and plays more as canned pumpkin pie filling than real pumpkin. Too sweet for my preference, but that’s offset somewhat by the emphatic spices. I’m intrigued by the suggestion that this gets served with whipped cream and nutmeg, and I think I’d enjoy trying that - but as it stands, it’s not very exciting. (12/20)

Grizzly Paw Jack OLantern Pumpkin Ale;Canmore, Alberta, Canada;Flavored - Other;Grizzly Paw Brewing Company;"Served on tap at Hop In Brew. Called the brewery for more information and was told that in the ""Big City"" they call it a pumpkin pie in a glass and serve it with a shot of 7-Up for sweetness, a dollop of whip cream and sprinkle of nutmeg. This was not done with the pint I had. No head. Aroma of pumpkin and cinnamon. Flavour was at first a shock. After that the malt held up. Flavour was similar to the aroma but with a strong hint of peppermint in the finish."

A sweet, malty wheat ale. Full-flavored and not light and dry like so many what brews are. Very interesting brew. I haven’t seen any of the others in this series, but I would like to.
Bell's Wheat Two Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bell's Brewery;Tap. Poured with a hazy honey-amber color and an off-white lacing head. Aroma is fairly weak and blend, mostly yeast, malts. Medium dense body with high carbonation. Well rounded, easy on the palate. It was all right.
Bell's Wheat Two Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bell's Brewery;Tap. Hazy orange pour with a white head. Aroma is Belgian yeast, clove, and orange/lemon. Not overly carbonated. Taste is similar to the aroma. Very nice beer!
Bell's Wheat Two Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bell's Brewery;This poured a very hazy yellow color with a white head. Aroma was lemon zest, yeast, and wheaty character. Flavor was very light and refreshing, lots of wheatyness character, some yeast, and some lemon citrus notes as well. An excellent wheat beer.
Bell's Wheat Two Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bell's Brewery;Pours a hazy orange with hints of wheaty malt, very light clove, and banana. Flavor is tart, light clove, metallic, grass, and lemon. Not horrible for a 3 1/2 year old wheat beer.
Bell's Wheat Two Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bell's Brewery;"Deep copper coloured body with a thin white head. Strong malt in the nose with a tiny bit of hops and nothing else. Light to medium bodied; decemt maltiness up front with some hops and a tiny bit of spice. After taste shows more of the malt and nothing of the complexity. Overall a pretty average beer good to try and recommended as a set. I sampled this 12 oz bottle at purchased at Merchants in Deerborn, MI on 28-May-206."
Bell's Wheat Two Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bell's Brewery;"Almost three years old now. A misty, coppery unfiltered orange. Husky wheat, creamed corn, cool metals and some dried caramel sweetness in the nose; nothing too blatantly offensive, but no moments of reassurance either. The lemon, clove and pastry bread qualities of its fresher character are present, and deeply buried under all the oldness. A wet, metallic and lemony tang in a severely thinned and somewhat soured flavor; still, it remains sufficiently crackery in its malts and prickly enough in its clove and cardamom intimations to suggest an age quite younger than it actually is. Medium body is crisp and sharp. Finishes on an odd, brisk lemon pepper spice/sour that’s somewhat unreadable. I don’t remember liking it when I had in pre-rating days, and I don’t much like it now; cheers to ticking, and thanks to the want-list fairy named Ken Weaver."
Bell's Wheat Two Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bell's Brewery;Coudy golden color with a pillowy white head. Smell of fresh bread, lemon, bananas and some clove too. Taste has soft on the banana and clove at the beginning, with a fresh bread and weird orange peel taste in the finish. Low carbonation and full body. Interesting experiment, but I didn’t really care for this.
Bell's Wheat Two Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bell's Brewery;Pours a semi hazey golden colour, small but noticeable white head. Aroma is slightly fruity, Sweet aroma with rich fruit character. Peach, red delicious apples, and cotton candy. Taste is smooth, light and fruit filled.
Bell's Wheat Two Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Bell's Brewery;Drinkable pleasant stuff - it reminded me some of their Winter White. Flavors of banana and a slight touch of spice.
Bell's Wheat Four Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Reddish amber color and large, beige foam. Cereal malt and white nose. Light body and very active carbonation. The hops come out and dominate the wheat, despite a touch of spice. The level of bitterness is surprising for a wheat beer, but I would like to have tried the other versions.
Bell's Wheat Four Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Bottle from Ughsmash, mega thanks! Bells is at the top of my list and getting this retired beer was a nice treat, even if the results were kind of ho-hum. Brownish orange, hazy, very large head that collapses back into the lively libation below. Aroma of yeast, mild banana, lemon and malt. Body is way over-carbonated with brown sugar, yeast and a candied aftertaste. Not up to the standards of typical Bells.
Bell's Wheat Four Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Bottle. Thanks to Sprinkle. Poured a hazy brown body with nice head. Aroma is malty, vanilla and noticable wheat character. Flavor is grainy, sweet malt, vanilla and yeast. I got a lot of sediment in my glass but overall a nice beer.
Bell's Wheat Four Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Possibly one of the only disappointing Bell’s product I have ever consumed. Shallow in flavor, and wildly off balance in its wheat characteristics (a bit too spicey).
Bell's Wheat Four Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Batch 7104 3/07/2008: Bell’s Wheat Four (4) Ale is ALL foam. Yep, that’s right. Pour it into a glass and all that’s there is off-white to beige foam! After letting it sit for awhile, it starts to collapse and a puddle of toasted golden liquid forms in the bottom of the glass. Surprisingly, the leve of carbonation in the beer appears to be low. I guess it all escaped during the pour. The aroma contains wheat malt, hints of caramal and toast, and a bunch of yeast. The flavor is somewhat confusing. At first this beer tastes like a poorly made extract beer. Then some Belgian candi sugar flavors start to become apparent as well as some wheat maltiness, vague fruitiness, and alcohol. There is a very, very light pepper quality and herbal bittterness in the dry and metallic finish. There is also some dried apricot flavor in the finish as well. This beer has a medium-light body and smooth on the palate. Overall this beer shows some Dukelweizen qualities, but isn’t nearly as good as The Bell’s WheatTwo (2) Ale. Maybe this one is past its prime now... After swirling around the yeast in the bottom and pouring it into the glass, the color is a nice, muddy light brown color (perfect for a Dunkelweizen) with a rocky off-white head. The aroma then becomes more yeasty and the flavor seems to have some additional toasted and caramel maltiness. However, the alcohol starts to pop out more as the beer warms. There is still more of a Belgian twist to this beer than a German Hefe quality. That must be because of the yeast strains used which makes for an interesting beer (and experiment in general), but isn’t really the flavor profile that I would have liked... 12 fl. oz. bottle from Party Town in Florence, Kentucky. Rating #201 for this beer... ______________________________ My other Bell’s Wheat Project Ratings: • Bell’s Wheat Two (2) Ale • Bell’s Wheat Four (4) Ale • Bell’s Wheat Six (6) Ale • Bell’s Wheat Eight (8) Ale • Bell’s Wheat Love Ale
Bell's Wheat Four Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Bottle from sprinkle -- thanks! Massively carbonated, pours a murky rust-water yellow brown with a tan head. Dominant notes in the aroma are bread dough and lemon zest. These are in the flavor too, along with a powerful stale-water taste, like when you mistakenly drink from a glass that has been sitting on your desk full of water for four days. That is new to me in beer. Pepper on the finish, wheat kernels. Down under that is an earth grain-husk complexity - saison-like - that deserves a few points. Pretty laid back in its flavors, but kinda enjoyable.
Bell's Wheat Four Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Pours golden with huge fluffy white head and nice lacing. This was way over-carbonated! Grains and banana on the nose. grainy esters along with some citrus. Dry wheat finish
Bell's Wheat Four Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Had all this Project beers and really did not think much of them. This just tasted like some macro brew for some reason. Yeah, some wheat going on but there was some overpowering crappy taste.
Bell's Wheat Four Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Badgerben’s Cellar Reduction night. Dark brown body with faint head. Wheaty nose with some malt. Banana and clove spices were a little faint.
Bell's Wheat Four Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Sampled entire series at Badgerben’s Cellar Reduction Night. Wheat #4 pours a hazy golden amber brew with a decent off-white head that ahs good retention and lacing. Aroma of nutty banana bread, a touch of yeast and some clove. Taste is medium bodied, lightly carbonated with flavors of multi-grain/wheat malt, some banana esters and some tart fruit. Finish is sightly tart with a dry wheat flavor aftertaste.
Millrose Oktoberfest;South Barrington, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Millrose Restaurant and Brewing Co.;Draft at Millrose Restaurant in South Barrington, IL. Small tan head with poor retention, transparent orange/golden body, no carbonation noted, and one ring of lacing. The aroma was malty, sweet and caramel. Ditto for the flavor. The mouthfeel was tingly and medium bodied. This beer lacks character and needs more aroma and flavor.
Millrose Oktoberfest;South Barrington, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Millrose Restaurant and Brewing Co.;This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a transparent uncarbonated orange colored body and a good lacing. The weak aroma was malty. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The mild flavor contained notes of mild hops and Vienna malt. An OK brew just nothing special.
Millrose Oktoberfest;South Barrington, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Millrose Restaurant and Brewing Co.;Orange/Yellow Coloring with White Ring. Sweet Caramel Malt with an Odd Twang in the Aftertaste. Tastes Contaminated and the Bartender Seemed to Whole Heartedly Agree.
Millrose Oktoberfest;South Barrington, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Millrose Restaurant and Brewing Co.;"The bartender forwarned us that this batch seems to be ""off"". Dark orange color with no head. Aroma seems to be citrus, maybe orange. Ugh... Sour malt is the base flavor with a nice dollop of moldy fruit on top. I hope this was ""off""."
Northstar;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Had this beer on 7/5/2006. Aroma is a light malt scent that has corn like back tones. Color is a bright gold with good carbonation and thin head. Taste is sweet with a nice mild bitterness on the end. Nothing great but OK to drink.
Northstar;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Can from Aldi. Light pale color with a minimal frothy white head that diminished quickly with minimal lacing. Light grainy aroma. Lighjt to medium body with a watery texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a moderate sweet finish. Drinkable,but not my first choice.
Northstar;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;"Can. So I am at work and the holidays are upon us and my co-workers decide that beers are in order. Now I know for a fact that there is Old Raspy and Commodore Perry in that fridge so I am definately in, but what do they go for... Northstar??? Alright, I’m no snob so I’ll bite... I say ""send a can this way."" The minute I pour this into my Dixie Cup glass I immediatly regret my decision as the pale yellow liquid fills the creases of of my wax layered cup. The aroma leaves no promise of redemption and I think to myself... this is gonna be bad. I try a sip and watered down flavors of corn and very mild lemon make there way to my apprehensive gut. This is bad stuff... really bad. After I finish I make a dash for the fridge and the Old Raspy, hoping all the while that my visably shaken constitution gets me there."
Northstar;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;"A ’craft-brewed"", light, pale lager style (aged after brewing for a few weeks) this beer MUST BE SERVED BELOW 36 DEGREES F. At higher temperatures the carbonation, flavor and palate suffers. The brew pours a light gold with an adequate head. The light yeast, malt and hops provides a nice taste to go well with baked/barbqued chicken or grilled burgers. It is a great value as a meal enhancer. It does not overpower the meld of flavors in a typical meal and is available at Aldi’s for $4.99 a 12 pack... so you can afford enough Northstar to feed the whole clan and not break the bank!"
Northstar;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Pours a clear gold with a surprisingly large, fluffy head into my duvel tulip (hah). Pretty rancid aroma, though mild in its rancor -- smelled significantly worse directly from the can. Allowing the beer to breathe in the tulip made it slightly less offensive. Flavor is nasty too though quite mild. Undercarbonation really brings out the worst of this beer.
Northstar;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;12oz can-Aroma of dirty dish towels. A light clear golden with no head retention. Taste with a slight hint of corn otherwise no taste.
Northstar;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Poured a pale gold with a small white head. Corny grainy aroma with a sweet grainy taste. Clean finish
Northstar;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Congratulations to me, my 100th rating! Too bad this is some filthy f’ing swill. Corn and zinc.
Northstar;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;This beer is pretty awful, as would be expected from the price (less than $5 a 12 pack at Aldi). Now don’t get me wrong, I like Aldi as much as the next guy, but don’t buy this. Lot’s of corn dominates the taste, and just a general nastiness as is present in all macros kills any chance of me regularly drinking this. Avoid.
Northstar;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Poured medium gold with a fairly durable head and light lacing. Aroma lightly malty with a hoppy note. A good light bodied, malty on the dry side, a little spicy with mild, mellow hoppiness in the finish. Reminds me a whole lot of their Rhinelander brand and a pretty good cheap beer that might even enhance your Aldi experience.
J.T. Whitneys Caramel Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Modest aromas of hay and cereals. Medium amber-red pour, minimal head. First sip is hay and biscuit, with a sour-sweet finish. Dry mouthfeel, soft carbonation. As it warms up, the dry and sour elements emerge and harmonize the whole.
J.T. Whitneys Caramel Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On draught at the brewpub in Madison, Wisconsin. Pours clear copper amber brew with a creamy off-white that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some spotty lacing and a thin off-white cream top. Aroma has a light scent of multi-grain malt, citrus zest and a touch of wheat. Taste is light bodied, some tart apple, roasted multi-grain malt and some citrus zest. Finish has a semi-dry character with some lemon zest at first and then a crisp, clean finish. Missing some of the distinct Altbier yeast I am familiar with but still an enjoyable ale.
J.T. Whitneys Caramel Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear medium orange color. The head was off white and left some lace behind on the glass. The aroma consisted of nothing more than a whiff of wheat toast. Light to medium bodied with a light, but distinct sour note. Dry and papery with a subdued adhesive tape flavor. Bad news. Nothing remotely enjoyable or altbier-like here.
J.T. Whitneys Caramel Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;I was advised to not get this one, because I might not like it. All the more reason to try it of course. And I found it to be mighty tastey. Pours a cloudy copper colour with a two finger sized almond coloured head. Aroma is sweet, caramel, apples, toffee and fresh roasted nuts. Mouthfeel was creamy, taste was pleasent, but noticeably dry. Finish is odd but enjoyable.
J.T. Whitneys Caramel Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Copper Coloring with Creme Ring. Sweet Malt Aroma. Carbonated.. Sweet Malt, Wet Hops, and a Bitter Dry Ending. Overall Pretty Musty and Hazy Flavor
J.T. Whitneys Caramel Alt;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Gold color with no head. Slightly dry malt aroma. The taste is based on a very dry and seemingly dusty malt concoction. Notes of musty apple? Not bad for an alt, though I’m not sure where they get the caramel name.
Depot Street Roundabout Rye Stout;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Stout;Depot Street Brewing;Little aroma, chestnut maybe. Clear ruby black, medium tan head. Charcoal and cardboard flavor. Very fizzy.
Depot Street Roundabout Rye Stout;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Stout;Depot Street Brewing;Bottle pour @ the 21st Richmond Gathering. Deep amber with a small head. Nose of stale bread. Cocoa. Chocolate. Taste is pretty objectionable. Meat drippings. Oxo cube. Chocolate, earth. Old brown bread. Light body, over-carbonated. Not great.
Depot Street Roundabout Rye Stout;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Stout;Depot Street Brewing;Bottle. Opaque brown color, tan head. Aroma, well, not much. Taste is very, very, very light caramel.
Depot Street Roundabout Rye Stout;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Stout;Depot Street Brewing;"""thanks Lou. beer #1 of the giant box! lots of suds here. it headed up two inches, but i turned my back, and when i came back, it was an inch or so above the glass and spilling over. a little oxygen? pretty dark, though a thinner stout. nice aromas of roasted grain, molasses, and the slightest hint of rye and like they say, astringency. i wanted more rye...i didn’t really get any in the flavor. overall, a decent dry stout."""
Depot Street Roundabout Rye Stout;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Stout;Depot Street Brewing;My introduction to Tennessee micro-brewing. This brew offers a unique combination, traditional coffee and dark chocolate stout flavors with a rye malty tang. Pours from the bottle a brown/ black color with some white head, average appearance. Aroma of roasted malt, average. Good distinctive flavor overall, enjoyable, medium mouthfeel, dryer finish. As I've never seen a rye stout before, I would drink this again as a bit of a novelty offering. A good introduction to Depot Street brewing.
Depot Street Roundabout Rye Stout;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Stout;Depot Street Brewing;bottle. small beige head. aroma has notes of licorice, molasses, tobacco with black barleys. intense roasted bitter flavors with a tart note. no real discernible hop notes. dry for sure. high carbonation.
Depot Street Roundabout Rye Stout;Jonesborough, Tennessee, United States;Stout;Depot Street Brewing;It's described as astringent. A horrible word to describe your beer. If it's a sour beer declare that. But I don't know what this is. Very light tart. Not from rye. Especially in nose. Proclaim a sour and it won't seem a mistake. Large billowy head. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Minty;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brouwerij Huyghe;31st October 2009 Post Borefts I jaunt to De Heeren van Liedekercke. A dark green beer with a light green head!! Mint and aged malt nose. Cooling smooth peppermint and mint. Has retained it’s core character even after 19 years (Kudos to the DHVL cellar as well). A little malt at the end but pretty much swamped with cooling mint. A great beer to upset people with! He he!
Minty;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brouwerij Huyghe;A Mes rate. Bottle from 1990 at DHVL. There has been one bottle of this left on the menu for a long long time, quite a few years I think. I’d always looked at it and laughed. Ken (madmitch77 to you lot) looks at what I consider one of the best menus in the world on his first visit to DHVL and immediately orders the Minty. Something wrong with you mate!!! I’m gonna give it a 5 for appearance just for the sheer hell of it. It’s a clean emerald green with an impressive light green head considering it’s 19 years old. It’s actually not anything like as bad as I was expecting. In fact I was part expecting projectile vomit but I managed to hold it in.Shit load of mint, lots of old caramel and as much cardboard as you would expect. Absolutely awful. Thanks Ken.
Minty;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brouwerij Huyghe;25cl really old bottle at DHVL on a roadtrip. Thanks to Ken, MadMitch for buying this as I can’t see anyone else having the balls to do so. Anyway, you know what? It’s not as bad as everyone made it out to be. Yes it’s green as hell, but clear and a slightly greenish white head. Peppermint on aroma. Bit of must. Mint like mouthwash and even some walnuts from the mustiness on the flavour. So it’s a minty mouthwash, but it has no off flavours and not as bad as some things I had this weekend.
Minty;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brouwerij Huyghe;Bottle 25cl. [ Vintage 1990 ]. Clear dark brown color with a average, fizzy, good lacing, mostly lasting, white to light green head. Aroma is moderate to heavy malty, sweet vintage malt, minty and minty. Flavor is light heavy sweet with a long to average duration, and a minty burnt in the finish. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft. [20081212]
Minty;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brouwerij Huyghe;Bottle 0,33ltr: Their beer with added mint and looks green as the hulk and taste like french peppermint ice just crap.
Minty;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brouwerij Huyghe;Botle at Heeren de Lidekerke. Pours a clear green with a frothy white head. Aroma is mint, sweet, and just a hint of malt. Taste is sweet peppermint and... Thats it. no other taste almost like toothpaste. Weird beer.
Minty;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brouwerij Huyghe;(Bottle 25 cl) One thing you soon learn as a Belgian beer lover is never to be surprised: not by name, bottle, style or flavour. So although I did find a peppermint beer rather odd, then again - so many Belgians are? And by Huyghe standards nothing is odd really. The beer pours golden with a small, creamy head. Aroma is pure mint. Flavour is pure, sweet mint - nothing else really. I believe the base beer is a blond ale. Refreshing all right when served cold. Wonder how big a market share Huyghe has for this....beer. 050498
Hook Norton Treason Tipple;Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Mild Ale;Hook Norton Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Olde Reinedeer, Banbury. Dark brown beer with bubbly white head. The beer has a damp smokey bonfire nose with a touch of straw, this follows onto the pallate with a chalky earth note underlying. The smokiness lasts until a hop kick takes over. It’s a mild without fruitiness but a decent beer nevertheless.
Fuller's Summer Ale (Cask);Chiswick, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Cask at London's Pride, Heathrow. Pours clear golden with small white head. Malty, some citrus notes, lemon, some vague bitterness in finish, sweetish. Soft carbonation. Light bodied.

The beer in the glass is okay. The aroma is dry, a little bit sharp. Very hoppy and sweet in the finish. Not really good!"
Clockwork Hazy Daze Peach;Glasgow, Scotland;Flavored - Fruit;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);Good, but a little insipit, I expected more sweetness from this beer, but it was a little soft, the foam is great and the colour too, althoug it has a lot of foam.
Bell's Wheat Six Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Muddy brown color with an off-white head that leaves some lacing. Smells of roasted coffee, some cocoa, and toasted bread. Tastes like a watered down cup of coffee paired with toast. It also has some cocoa flavors to it as well as a little hoppiness in the finish. Medium carbonation and lighter than medium body. Probably wouldn’t seek this out again. This, and the other beers in the Wheat series were reviewed in early 2006. These are from notes.
Bell's Wheat Six Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;On tap at brewery during the Wheat Project. Wonderful stuff that is exceptionally flavored.
Bell's Wheat Six Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Batch 7119 3/08/2008: Bell’s Wheat Six (6) Ale pours as a glass full of foam just like the Wheat Four (4) did. WAY too much carbonation at this point. After some time the rocky off-white/light beige foam starts to settle out and some amber-colored liquid starts to collect in the bottom of the glass. Unfortunately this process is much slower than it was for the Wheat Four (4) Ale... The yeasty aroma contains traces of toasted wheat and butter caramel. The flavor has a really nice toasted maltiness with some darker undertones. The alcohol flavor is more controlled in this one than it was in the Wheat Four (4). There is a soft herbal/grassy bitterness in the finish. Some additional character starts to come out after mixing in the yeast at the bottom of the bottle and with some additional warmth. The Belgian candi and fruity flavors are subdued with some American/German wheat beer characteristics including creamy wheat, more caramel and lightly toasted malt, traces of chocolate, a faint wiff of smoke/char, and a touch more bitterness becomes apparent. The appearance is also cloudy and opaque amber brown with a dense and forever-lasting off-white/beige head. This beer has a really smooth mouthfeel and a medium body. The carbonation level of the actually beer is really low at this point (it all escaped during the pour!). So far this beer was marginally better than the Wheat Four (4), but not as good as the Wheat Two (2). 12 fl. oz. bottle from Party Town in Florence, Kentucky. Rating #170 for this beer... ______________________________ My other Bell’s Wheat Project Ratings: • Bell’s Wheat Two (2) Ale • Bell’s Wheat Four (4) Ale • Bell’s Wheat Six (6) Ale • Bell’s Wheat Eight (8) Ale • Bell’s Wheat Love Ale
Bell's Wheat Six Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;12 oz. bottle (batch 7119) via trade with hopdog - Bottle opened with a big hiss! Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a huge ass off white head. After about 5 minutes I finally get to drink the beer. Aroma is light malt, esters and a light soapiness. Flavor is toasted malt and esters. A smooth, medium bodied beer. This beer is very good for its age. A bigtime thanks goes out to Steve for sending this one.
Bell's Wheat Six Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;12 oz bottle pour that, even if I jostled the bottle when opening poured the most ridiculous sized head of any bottle of beer I’ve ever had. Did they add CO2 to this? I can appreciate Bells creativity and daring, but this is not their best beer. Ratebeer classifies it as a Dunkleweizen and the commercial description reads like a math problem. It’s not even close to being a great dunklewiezen and winds up being simply an odd experiment.
Bell's Wheat Six Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Badgerben’s Cellar Reduction night. Clear borwn color some yead. What and yeast on the nose with some citrus hints. Similar flavors in the body.
Bell's Wheat Six Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Sampled entire series at Badgerben’s Cellar Reduction Night. Wheat #6 pours a semi-clear orangish amber brew with a decent fizzy white head that has good retention and some spotty lacing. Aroma of wheat/yeasty malt, a touch of caramel, fruit and lemon zest. Taste is medium bodied, well carbonated with flavors of wheat bread with yeast and some grassy hop bitterness. Finish is slightly gritty with a yeasty bread aftertaste.
Bell's Wheat Six Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;I liked this one the best out of the wheat series. Nice wheat-bread-yeast type flavor. Pretty well balanced. Pleasant aftertaste.
Bell's Wheat Six Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Side by side comparison with bottles of Two, Four, Six, Eight and Love. New Years Day 2006, I believe. *TWO pours light orange with minimal, but noticeable haze in the bottle. Sweet nose does have a bit of spice showing through as it warms. Body is light. Dry and spicy at the finish of the bottle. Not as creamy as Oberon, lighter body. Light spices remind of a lighter witbier. Quite average, though. *FOUR is much drier and straigh grainier wheat flavor than the two. Re-writing this review, it is what GI 312 is like today. Straw and grass with tiny hints of sweet bread and cookie barely coming through...teasing. *SIX is a bit darker and more malt flavors are present in the nose and especially in the flavor. Sweet and mapley with the grassy dryness at the end quickly fading. *EIGHT is dark and cloudy, nutty aroma. Flavor is really weak, as is the body. Some tiny roasted flavors, but this one seems the weakest of the bunch, despite it’s color. *LOVE - I thought the order would go lighter to darkest, finishing with LOVE, but this is just as light as TWO. Nose is compoletely different, with alcohol upfront and some banana bread. Body is nice and rich, malty, some spices drying at the finish. The aftertaste, dry from apparent alcohol is also spicy and wonderful. The clear winner of the series for me!

Bell's Wheat Eight Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Bottle thanks to MrBunn. Nose is of some chocolate, honey, and wheat. Taste is very similar, with the wheat standing out a bit more. Pours a dark brown with good lacing head. Considering its age its held up very well.
Bell's Wheat Eight Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Murky dark brown color with a light colored head that leaves only small amounts of lacing. Coffee and roast in the smell, but there were also some hints of dark fruit and spice. Taste has some fresh green bean taste, coffee, and some dark fruits. High carbonation and light body. Again, this was certainly interesting, but not that enjoyable.
Bell's Wheat Eight Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Interesting beer. If you had put it in front of me blindfolded I would have guessed I was drinking a typical hefe. Murky, dark brown pour. Aroma is yeasty, funky, citrus, and maybe some green grapes? Flavor is not as bold as the color would indidcate, but it is a good wheat beer anyway. Worth trying, but I wouldnt seek it out.
Bell's Wheat Eight Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;I was a very big fan of this beer, it was a very delicious smelling beer, and perhaps one of the darkest wheat beers I’ve ever had. The head wasn’t terribly big, but the color was a very pretty dark brown. There was a lot of yeast flavor and aroma.
Bell's Wheat Eight Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;From bottle when released with the Wheat series. While the Wheat Love was fantastic, Wheat 8 fell well short of my expectations.
Bell's Wheat Eight Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Batch 7133: I actually forgot I had this hiding in the back of my fridge and figured I’d pull it out before heading out to watch the tourney games. Pours a dark ruby brown with a small tan head. Some slight oxidation has set in but not enough to detract from it too much...I can pretty much pick up on dark wheat and some subtle dark fruits and cinnamon. Still very well carbonated and has a nice body. Some mild chocolate notes are present with the wheat and dark malts...the fruity esters are present a tad bit as well. This is the only one out of the series that ended up being rateable...the others were drain pours and horribly oxidized. Even with this much age on it this still buries the local microbrewery’s Dunkelweizen that’s on tap right now.
Bell's Wheat Eight Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;12 oz. bottle (7133) via trade with hopdog - Pours a brown color with a large one and 3/4 finger thick light tan head. Faint lacing. Has a grain (corn flakes) and very light chocolate aroma. Flavor is light chocolate, faint esters, and some oxidation setting in. Medium body. I bet this beer was really good fresh. This beer completes the Bells Wheat Project for me. Thanks Steve.
Bell's Wheat Eight Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Batch 7133 3/08/2008: Surprisingly, Bell’s Wheat Eight (8) Ale doesn’t manifest itself as a glass full of foam when it is poured! Instead, it pours more or less normal and results in a cloudy dark brown/chocolate color with an average-sized disipating dark beige/tan head. There is an ample level of visible carbonation. The aroma has chocolate and some toasted and creamy wheat malt as well as some notes earthy fruit. The flavor is nutty and slightly toward the sweet side with undertones of chocolate (cocoa), toasted wheat malt, and some dry, earthy hops and bitterness. This beer has a medium body and is smooth on the palate. I really like the balance and richness of the flavors in this beer compared to Wheat Two (2), Wheat Four (4), and Wheat Six (6). Unlike the previous two beers, this one seems more like a regular production beer rather than an experimental one. So far this is the most complex and best of the Bell’s Wheat Series... 12 fl. oz. bottle from iowaherkeye. Thank you! Rating #194 for this beer... ______________________________ My other Bell’s Wheat Project Ratings: • Bell’s Wheat Two (2) Ale • Bell’s Wheat Four (4) Ale • Bell’s Wheat Six (6) Ale • Bell’s Wheat Eight (8) Ale • Bell’s Wheat Love Ale
Bell's Wheat Eight Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Bottle. Thanks to Sprinkle for sending me the bottle. Poured a deep brown body with nice head. aroma is bubblegum, dark fruits, black cherries. Flavor is a smooth balance of dark fruits, black grapes, sweet malt and chocolate. Enjoyable.
Bell's Wheat Eight Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Bell's Brewery;Bottle from Sprinkle -- thanks! Pours very dark brown with a nice light-tan head. The aroma is dusty wheat and grain husks, mild clove and banana, yeast, cobweb. Fairly gentle nutty flavor, mildly sweet, hints of chocolate, again that dusty sun-warmed earthiness, surprisingly little of the banana and clove. Altogether this one is very drinkable, despite the aggressive carbonation. It’s not the sort of beer that necessarily makes you sit bolt upright in your chair in flavor amazement, but it’s really enjoyable and it lasted a very brief time in my glass before disappearing all too soon.
Northumberland Canny Legs;Blyth, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;North Blyth (prev. Northumberland);Another bitter one, but this has a little character different form the rest, it was, I think, a little chiller than the most of them.
Northumberland Gateshead Gold;Blyth, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Blyth (prev. Northumberland);cask at guilford arms edinburgh...amber ... bubbly white head ... sweet floral pine hop nose ... mokey ligth fruits ... little soapy.
Northumberland Gateshead Gold;Blyth, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Blyth (prev. Northumberland);Cask pint in Newcastle. Pours a hazy golden with big creamy white head. Bitter and hoppy, slight fruit but not much else. Bitter finish. Not bad but slightly boring pint.

Northumberland Gateshead Gold;Blyth, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Blyth (prev. Northumberland);A Mes rate: Cask at The Artillery. Nicely balanced bitter. No real character other than very obvious hops and malt, just well balanced and reasonably enjoyable.

Northumberland Gateshead Gold;Blyth, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Blyth (prev. Northumberland);Cask gravity at Red Lion, Snargate. Hazy amber colour with disappearing white head. Sweet, syrupy aroma. Some hop. Tastes stronger than it is. Bit too syrupy to be nice for me. Dry finish. Some fruit, bit of lime/lemon citrus, bit of strawberry. But a bit muddy and muddled.
Northumberland Gateshead Gold;Blyth, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Blyth (prev. Northumberland);Cask Conditioned at The Fountain, Lower Gornal, W.Midlands.

Bright and easy for the strength.
Northumberland Gateshead Gold;Blyth, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Blyth (prev. Northumberland);Well, another beer, similar to the previous one, but a little more clear, as it says, Gold. BUt with more foam.
Sly Fox Chinook IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Clear orange color with small head and massive lacing. Fruity aroma with good bitter balance. Light finish.
Sly Fox Chinook IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Tap at Hop Devil Grill. Deep amber beer with a thick white head. These beers always look great. Strong resinous hop aroma, pine and fresh grapefruit/orange fruitiness. Toasted malts, grassy/piney hops. Chewy hop flavour throughout. Light orange peel flavour as well. It’s straightforward, but well made... I think this is a hop that works better as part of a blend, but it’s still a solid brew.
Sly Fox Chinook IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;POurs somewhat of a coppery hue. Notes of flower and some sweet fruits. The hop hit comes on the palate with dense amounts of the citrus and bitter hops making its way through the beer.
Sly Fox Chinook IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Draught at Pete’s Waterfront Ale House. Poured a fairly dark copper with an off-white head leaving striped lacing. Sweet tangerine and peach nose, with some underlying piney resin aromas. Flavor, as always in these SF IPA projects, starts with a big hop blast. Here, the particular hops were earthy and spicy, with a tart citrus/grapefruit zest base. I love how these IPA projects seem to beat my tongue with hop sticks!. Deep citrusy hop character settles into a pleasingly resiny aftertaste. Nonetheless, there is enough of a firm caramel malt foundation to give the hops center stage, with some flowing into the audience, but still maintain a semblence of order and balance. Not sure how SF quite does this.
Sly Fox Chinook IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Draft at the Phoenixville Brewpub. This one was a little to bitter. A little young. Nice and clear on the pour.
Sly Fox Chinook IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Simcoe was my favorite in 2004 , and now chinook is my favorite for 2005. Has lots of pine and citrus, with some harsh almost smoke-like hints in the end. Flavor is raw with fresh chinook hops- similar to AB without the thick dark crystal malts. I really like the raw harsh bitterness that chinook leaves- probably from the high cohumulone.
Sly Fox Chinook IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;On tap at the Sly Fox Brew Pub. Poured a medium and clear amber color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of citrus and flowers. Tastes of citrus with a nice grapefruit finish. For an IPA, I liked the bitterness in this one. Some lacing left on the glass.
Sly Fox Chinook IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Poured a clear amber color, with a small, off white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrus fruits, notably tangerine, perfume, and grassy hops. Taste was dry and bitter, lots of grapefruit, some metal, almost like a penny. Least favorite from the IPA project to date.
Sly Fox Chinook IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Pours a translucent orange amber with a small off white head. Aroma of floral hops, some citrus and caramel malts as well. Flavor was bitter grapefruit, one dimensional as expected, but decently balanced out.
Sly Fox Chinook IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Draught @ Pheonixville: Smells hoppy and bitter with hints of cherry, choclate, pepper, and malts. Orange in color. Clear. Small white head. Small lacing. Flavor is lightly sweet but heavily bitter. Tastes of hops, cherrys, pepper, and a little roasted. Medium body. Lively carbination. Bitter finish. Leaves mouth bitter. Overall, a good all around IPA I could drink a lot of.
Wynkoop Adulterator Anniversary Bock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Very sweet aroma. Hops are present in the aftertaste, dry with minimal lager-esuq characteristics. An almost cinamon/pumpkin flavor to it. Deep red-brown minimal head. Good having hop & malt flavors, but they weren’t married, if you will -very much so a one after another in terms of flavor.
Wynkoop Adulterator Anniversary Bock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wynkoop Brewing Company;The malt came off almost metallic. I love the food in the brewery but this was not right.
Wynkoop Adulterator Anniversary Bock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wynkoop Brewing Company;I remember this as a very thick beer with great smooth flavor. There may have been a bitter aftertaste, but my buds were blasted after trying the Wynkoop Weizenbock. I would order this beer again, if only because of the name!
Wynkoop Adulterator Anniversary Bock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Draught. Pours dark brown with a creamy tan head. Caramel roasted malt (cookie) and sweet maple aroma, lightly hopped. Caramel malt roasted flavor with hoppy notes and maple. Medium and warm body, smooth palate.
Wynkoop Adulterator Anniversary Bock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Draught, Wynkoop, Denver. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is dark brown. Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, molasses, chocolate), with a note of bubble gum, light note of smoke. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Wasn’t completely sure this was a doppelbock with no ABV info and not a lot of obvious ETOH in the finish, but it was a relatively thick, sweet beer and called a bock, with an -ator ending, so...seems pretty likely. Anyways, this was decent enough, somewhat simple and too sweet but certainly not bad at all.
New Holland Pub Lager;Holland, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;New Holland Brewing Company;This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized white colored head of finely sized mostly diminishing bubbles that left behind a quickly disappearing softly carbonated transparent orange colored body and a poor lacing.

John Harvards Say Uncle! Dunkel;Washington DC, Washington DC, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;John Harvards Brewhouse Washington DC;Draft in D.C.... Clear, mohagony ale with a small, fizzy, white head. Mild chocolate and cherries with a whimper of caramel. The flavor is thin and a bit empty with promises of chocolate, mild toffee and sassafras. Light to medium-bodied and lightly creamy with lively carbonation. Watery finish.

Northwoods Chippewa Valley Oktoberfest Lager;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Northwoods Brew Pub;Better than most Northwoods beer. Some carmel notes, high carbonation, big head. Let’s not forget the metallic aftertaste.
Northwoods Chippewa Valley Oktoberfest Lager;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Northwoods Brew Pub;Sampled on draught at the brewpub in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Pours a clear, coppery amber brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that leaves behind a fine film and ring. Aroma of light caramel malt, some butterscotch, sweet apples and flowery hops. Taste is light to medium bodied, well carbonated and has a slight butterscotch and caramel flavor. Finish is slightly metalic at first and then a watery caramel and butterscotch aftertaste. Any bitterness wuickly disappears after the finish. This is one of the lightest Märzen beers I have ever tried.
Northwoods Chippewa Valley Oktoberfest Lager;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Northwoods Brew Pub;Copper Coloring with White Ring. Sweet Stale Malt Aroma.

Northwoods Chippewa Valley Oktoberfest Lager;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Northwoods Brew Pub;Had to rerate, 2008 batch better that prior. Same look, but much cleaner and some actual toasted notes. There were hints of diacetyl, but still seems like an amber lager. Original 25 October, 2005: 4,3,5,3,9- 2.4 Copper color with a small beige head. Charcoal (the real stuff), mild fruit and a touch of medicinal stuff in the aromas. Clean feel and taste. To much so, as this comes out more like a light amber lager. Clean, but this ain’t no oktoberfest even in the northwoods, ya!
Northwoods Chippewa Valley Oktoberfest Lager;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Northwoods Brew Pub;Dark gold color with no head.

Coops Starbock;Campbell, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Campbell Brewing Company;This beer was very mild in both flavor and aroma for a weizenbock.

Coops ESB;Campbell, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Campbell Brewing Company;Had this with Amanda for my last meal in California before the long drive home. Paired it with the Sirloin steak (rare of course). Nose of wheat and spice, neutral and light for the style. The brew is clover honey amber. The fully lasting stiff off-white creamy head leaves rocky lace. The front is balanced with light acidity in the middle followed by a very floral and soapy toasty bitter finish. The light to medium body is dry and lively.

Ste. Andre Dougs Scotch Ale;Stratford, Ontario, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Stratford Brewing Company;Certainly much better than the original viennA lager. A nice sudsy sweet smoky brew with a medium body, a moderate breadiness and some foamy goodness. I approve!
Ste. Andre Dougs Scotch Ale;Stratford, Ontario, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Stratford Brewing Company;Cloudy, dark brown w/ sudsy light tan foam. Sweet, malty aroma of brown sugar w/ a light smokiness & some woody vanilla. Light-medium feel w/ very low carbonation. Flavour is predominately sweet & malty w/ very little complexity.
Ste. Andre Dougs Scotch Ale;Stratford, Ontario, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Stratford Brewing Company;I had this at the Volo Cask fest, Oct. 22, 2005. Brewed by Doug Pengelly, founder of Saint André Brewing. He has worked for Upper Canada, C’est What (brewpub), and graduated from the master brewers program at UC Davis. He currently has his Vienna lager brewed at Cool Brewing, Burlington, Ontario. As far as I know this was a one-off, but I wouldn’t be suprised if it becomes available. F: Sweet and syrupy, with a deep, complex maltyness. Unfortunately, it did seem a little green (young)... with a little time, it’d probably be a little more rounded/integrated, and not quite as sweet. Some underlying alcholic-warmth, but very well hidden. P: Moderate to heavy body, syrupy. O: Big & bold, but I found it a little rough around the edges, and not an easy drinker.
Ste. Andre Dougs Scotch Ale;Stratford, Ontario, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Stratford Brewing Company;I had this on the second day of the cask festival and was assured that this was a different keg. I was also told that it was better the day before. Pours cloudy brown with a nose of charred cocoa and light alcohol. Watery and sweet, earthy mushrooms. Sour milk. I think it was off, but everyone else thought it was great.
Ste. Andre Dougs Scotch Ale;Stratford, Ontario, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Stratford Brewing Company;cask. brownish-mahogany with a bready white head. aroma is nice - mild light caramel sweetness and yeasty bread notes. the flavour is much of the same bread with sweet caramel and butterscotch, yeast, and light alcohol. very quaffable.
Ste. Andre Dougs Scotch Ale;Stratford, Ontario, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Stratford Brewing Company;At Volo Cask Days. Sweet malt and sugar in the aroma, cloudy brown, smallest of tan heads. Taste is light malt, soft hops. Light bodied, nice mouthfeel, you’d never know it was 7 %. Fine.
Ste. Andre Dougs Scotch Ale;Stratford, Ontario, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Stratford Brewing Company;Cask at Bar Volo’s Cask Days 2005. Pours a murky dark brown with a small frothy light-brown head. Nice aroma of roasted malt and vanilla. Flavour of roasted malt, nuts and light hops was very fresh and flavourful. I could not taste or feel the 7%, you would never know the alcohol content was that high. One of the better surprises of the day -- well done.
Ste. Andre Dougs Scotch Ale;Stratford, Ontario, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Stratford Brewing Company;Volo Cask Days 2005. Deep dark brown pour. Smokey malt taste, excellent. Taste is really nutty with a hint of smoke and touch of lingering bitterness. A fruity element to it as well. 7%? Hmm, really hid it well. A true session classic and one of the best of the fest, nice job Stratford!
Ste. Andre Dougs Scotch Ale;Stratford, Ontario, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Stratford Brewing Company;Hazy , dark brown . Creamy top . Bitter , woody aroma , clean. Smoky roast. More of same goes with flavour, decent woodiness, earthy hops. Sweet malt at finish. Good ale.
Ste. Andre Dougs Scotch Ale;Stratford, Ontario, Canada;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Stratford Brewing Company;Draught (cask). At Volo Cask Days 2005. Poured a murky deep orange with a good light brown average head. Aroma was initially very strong with chlorophyll, the sweet fresh hops, slightly roasty malt, very candyish, hints of vanilla. Taste was lovely and malty, quite strong bitter hops to balance it, though - a bit of banana and a fair amount of alcohol. Mouthfeel was very active and creamy. Well done, Ste. André - that’s another good offering to go with the Vienna Lager. I was astonished how much I liked it.
Heritage Black Currant Rye Lager;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Kichesippi Beer Company;Originally rated December 2006. Missed it last year, and this year it is at 5.5% ABV. Written Solstice Series 2006, Winter Solstice Mooney’s Bay. Pours a clean rich copper colour with a slight red hue. Off-white (almost pink) creamy head dissipates at a decent pace, and leaves nice dirty lacing all around. A surface of foam stays on the brew (the whole time). Very lightly carbonated. Aromas of roasted malts and the fruit is lightly hidden in the background. Creamy mouthfeel. The taste is sweet, but not overly, with a nice bitter finish. Both blend well in the aftertaste. I cannot stop thinking about grapefruits, as this is the fruit I smell and taste. I guess it is the bitterness and the fruit mix. Quite pleasant, will make it a rendez-vous every year.
Heritage Black Currant Rye Lager;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Kichesippi Beer Company;Sweet fruits and hops to the nose, seemed very promising. Poured a nice reddish brown with little to no head yet still managed to leave behind good lacing. Flavour reminded me of an organic beer I had once not that long ago. Sweet berries (of course), rich malt, hops and astringent aftertaste. Mouthfeel was watery. On the whole, this was a refreshing beverage, but not a personal fav.
Heritage Black Currant Rye Lager;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Kichesippi Beer Company;Juice? concentrate? Nice head, grows on you. Bittersweet overall. I think not the real thing, and a lager. Volo Cask Days. Colour for some points. Some rye, but not prominent.
Heritage Black Currant Rye Lager;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Kichesippi Beer Company;deep red colour with mahogany highlights. Aroma reminds me of ginger ale - spicy and sweet. Not so much black currant in the aroma. Flavour is very sweet berry flavour balanced with a spiciness from the rye. Pours with little head though it leaves a nice belgian lace on the glass. tastes somewhat like mixing ribena and a coup de grisou. Well balanced between beer character and berry flavour although definitely leans more towards the black currant. Overall not a bad beer but finishes too sweet for my taste - especially in a quart bottle.
Heritage Black Currant Rye Lager;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Kichesippi Beer Company;Clear amber w/ creamy, light beige foam. Aroma of wet cardboard & sweet berries. Light, syrupy feel. Sweet, artificial fruit flavour w/ notes of spoiled milk. Ugh!
Heritage Black Currant Rye Lager;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Kichesippi Beer Company;Bottle. Ruby-pink tinged brown body with a small beige head, decent lacing. Fruity, currant - hint of syrupy not quite cough syrupy sweet notes. Fairly bland malt sweetness in the middle, very light fruit lingers very mildly. Average palate. Not great, but I think this one probably depends greatly on how much you like the flavour of currants.
Heritage Black Currant Rye Lager;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Kichesippi Beer Company;650 ml bottle courtesy of Tupalev... thanks. Deep copper colour beer with a thick fast-fading off-white head. Sweet fruity aroma, blackcurrent along with some faint tart sourness. As the temperature comes up a bit there are some soft toast/biscuit malt notes. On the taste... gak! Very sweet and sugary, with a hint of light fruit. Some dirty higher alcohols and vegetables mix with an astringent soapy finish. Rapidly becomes cloyingly sweet. Pretty rough.
Heritage Black Currant Rye Lager;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Kichesippi Beer Company;"Solstice Series 2005. First bottle tasted in trade from Tupalev. A little sticky around the cap bot the bottled sounded good when it opened and it poured with a nice lasting foam. Copper coloured. Looks very good for a fruit beer. Aroma of an empty can. Tart but too sweet is the first taste impression. Somehow has a pickle juice quality. Not too tasty; a complicated mixture that has no joy."
Heritage Black Currant Rye Lager;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Kichesippi Beer Company;Bottle: Poured a deep reddish color ale with a medium off-white head with minimal retention. Aroma of black currant chemically reproduced syrup. Taste is also dominated by this syrup with a weird mix of malt (rye?). Body is thin and carbonation is very low. A new low for this brewery?

Yo-Ho India Pale Ale;Nagano, Japan;IPA;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;Draught at Keyaki 2014. IPA 2014 version. Quite hoppy and smooth, pulpy mango, touch of lollipop. Kind of a richer hoppier Yona-Yona.
Yo-Ho India Pale Ale;Nagano, Japan;IPA;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;Entirely unspectacular but drinkable ipa. Fruity, caramel, pale malt. Tastes sweet with floral hops, just a little bit bitterness. Can’t decides if it wants to be a pale ale or an ipa.
Yo-Ho India Pale Ale;Nagano, Japan;IPA;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;Can (from tasting session notes). Restrained aroma. Flavors are similar to Aooni, but softer and more subdued. Has more bittering hops than Aooni and an even smoother mouth feel. Also a longer finish than Aooni, with a touch of mocha. Mild, but mature
Yo-Ho India Pale Ale;Nagano, Japan;IPA;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;Well made all rounder of an English IPA. Smooth velvety toffee malt body. Good solid bitterness in resiney form, a little floral too. Decent dry finish. Not too exciting but good drinking.
Yo-Ho India Pale Ale;Nagano, Japan;IPA;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;Can. Deep copper to amber. Medium-sized head, lasting quite long before moving towards lacing. Good malt aroma, though hops seems to dominate, not cascade, fuggles, I think. It is slightly fruity tasting, with quite a bit of caramel. Butterscotch or maybe honey? Rich malt, more roasted tasting. Stronger—good alcohol taste. Dark or dried fruit flavors, very strong bitterness, but not citrus. British, old fashioned, serious. Finish is intensely bitter and long lasting. Pretty light body for a strong tasty beer. Excellent, very complex and interesting.
Yo-Ho India Pale Ale;Nagano, Japan;IPA;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;Nice hazy orange colour and a semi-syrupy flavour that leaves a sweet tingle around the lips. Not as hoppy as I would have preferred but certainly drinkable.
Yo-Ho India Pale Ale;Nagano, Japan;IPA;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;Bottle sampled on 9/15/07: Pours a hazy dark golden bronze with a spotty white head. Aroma of lightly sweet pale malt and herbal bittering hops. Body starts slightly sweet and earthy bitter toward a drier peppery finish. An interesting IPA.
Yo-Ho India Pale Ale;Nagano, Japan;IPA;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;Can @ Bulldog Pub, Ginza: Nice ruby color, light head and lacing. Nose of light earthy hops, some nice sweet malts and a thin, lighter body. Not nearly enough hops, a pale ale, on a stretch, but still good drinking.
Yo-Ho India Pale Ale;Nagano, Japan;IPA;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;Poured a hazy light orange-amber color with a thin white head. Aged malt aroma with some citrus poking through. Malty start to the flavor with a hoppy middle and finish. Mild to moderate bitterness on the finish. Semi-dry.
Yo-Ho India Pale Ale;Nagano, Japan;IPA;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;Thanks to daijokey for bringing this one out. Pale amber beer. Light caramel maltiness with a soft toffeeish character. Hops show a hint of orange and a bit of spicy/herbal character. A bit of honey and brown sugar also make an appearance as well. Earthy bitterness and low esters. Sweet earthy/caramel flavour. A bit of age showing itself, but it actually seems to work.
Ellicottville Imperial Pale Ale;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Ellicottville Brewing;Bottle. Hazy orange amber body with a whit head. Huge paper, grain, and very domineering bittering hop character. Light citrus and more grain etoh to finish.

Ellicottville Imperial Pale Ale;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Ellicottville Brewing;"Draft. I had this in the restaurant and must say I was utterly shocked. It was served warm (arguably too warm) and had an extremely strong alcoholic quality. As far as beer goes it was unpleasant; as far as drinking alcohol it was harsh and would get the job done (although I can think of better ways to get wasted). Could use more sweet maltiness to balance some of the harsher alcohol."
Ellicottville Imperial Pale Ale;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Ellicottville Brewing;Tap at MacGregor’s - Henrietta, NY Orange-ruby body with a thin white head.

Ellicottville Imperial Pale Ale;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Ellicottville Brewing;(draft @ MacGregor’s - Henrietta, NY) Rich and dark copper color with a very thin tan head. Aroma is kind of light, but very floral with some sweet malts and a touch of caramel. Flavor is loaded with bitter and floral hops, followed up by some smooth and sweet malts and a slightly bitter and very warming finish. Did not know that the alcohol was that high in this one.
Ellicottville Imperial Pale Ale;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Ellicottville Brewing;This is not lawnmower beer, that is to say it’s not an all day beer. Very bitter but a wonderful finish. Appearance is slightly cloudy but still clear. Very thick head with stick to the glass properties. While its only seasonal and should be taken in small quantities, this is the best drunk for the bucks beer I’ve had in quite some time. I was given a free keg of this by a friend and he told me it was $ 180.00 for a keg. I must send him a thank you card.

Hair of the Dog Rose Cassis;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Bottle @ 5 Kay, 7.5 Kay, 10 Kay Tasting. Ugly pour. Pretty soupy reddish brown with a small head. Pretty rough nose. Quite yeasty. Muddled red fruits and leather. Sickly apple. Taste is soft of similar, all over the place. Red berries covered in cocoa powder. Bready. Slightly sour. Some general cardboard oxidization. Very cool to try, but clearly a shadow of its former self.
Hair of the Dog Rose Cassis;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Bottle shared at the 5K/7.5K/10K tasting - who has a 7.5K tasting?, from an IP trade with MJ, 30/12/14. Murked up reddish amber with moderate off white spotting - touch of festival toilet water about the appearance! Nose is raspberry, straw, fruit syrup, quite rich fruit considering the age. Taste comprises blackcurrant jelly, oxidisation has set in but not OTT, fruit gum, red berry syrup. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, sweet berry and must in the close. Ok as fruit beers go and certainly considering the age.
Hair of the Dog Rose Cassis;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;"Bottle shared in London - thanks to Colin for this. Pours murky brown with a bubbly head; looks like poop water. Smells like tart fruits, a bit of meat. Light sweet flavor with old berries, wood, leather, earth. Light bodied with fine carbonation.

Pours a murky, cloudy, pinkish-brown color with a thin white head. Aroma is fruity, raspberry, some light sherry and oxidation. Medium on the palate with lively carbonation, even after 8 years. Flavor is sweet, bready, yeasty, tart, fruity, blackcurrant, raspberry, some sherry oxidation, with a light fruity finish. An ugly beer, no doubt, but it held up reasonably well and is still pretty tasty after 8 years.

Not exactly sure why, but it’s the oldest brew I had in my ""cellar"" (a box in my daughter’s room). murky orange-brown sludgy pour with a slight white ring. aroma is soft peach, caramel, cherry. tastes are dried fruit, the currants, lightly tart, buttery, berries, raisins. soft carbonation. based on the recent ratings I wasn’t expecting much, but it was a fun sipper."
Hair of the Dog Rose Cassis;Portland, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;3rd November 2010 Cloudy pink brown beer, no real head. Not pretty! Dry palate. Woody dryness with mild tart blackcurrant. Mild lactose like sweetness in the undertone. Semi dry finish. A slightly odd beer - ugly as hell but with a pleasant blackcurrant that avoids being too acidic.

John Harvards Punk-N-Spice;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);I love pumpkin ales and the spicy autumn seasonals. This one didn’t disappoint on a sampler of about 7 beers. Served in a glass lined with nutmeg and cinnamon spices (just like a margarita’s salt), each sip was outstanding. Pumpkin presence was subtle but sufficient. The kids thought it was the greatest looking beer I’ve ever had and they enjoyed the aroma multiple times.
John Harvards Punk-N-Spice;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);On tap in DC. Aargo0 ordered a pint and the rim of the glass was covered with brown sugar. I had this with my sampler and even the little sample glass had brown surgar on the rim. This had more of a gingersnap cookie with a swirl of caramel taste than pumpkin - yeah, I guess the pumpkin is in there, but the spices win out this time (hooray for that). A nice blend of flavor without being overwhelming. I actually liked this more than I expected to.
John Harvards Punk-N-Spice;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);"Springfield, PA location; aka Pumpkin Ale. Strong upfront nutmeg spice nose, amber body, and overall a well spiced pumpkin ale. Brown sugar on the rim not included."

Came out with a ring of brown sugar on the glass. I had it with and without the brown sugar on the rim. Ruddy amber body. Notes of light spice, faint hops, clove and faint fruit. Taste is semi-sweet with light spices and faded malts. Very light hops and fruits notes. Body is light with mild carbonation. Finish bring forth a bit more spice and a hint of sweet malts. Light fruit/pumpkin notes. Tasted better with the brown sugar on the rim. Like hopscotch stated, not much going on here, but it is inoffensive.
John Harvards Punk-N-Spice;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Draft in D.C.... Bland effort. I asked the bartender to hold the cinnamon sugar. Shouldn’t have. Without it, there’s just not much going on in the aroma or flavor. Not offensive, though. I don’t know why anyone would enjoy this other than the sheer novelty. Refreshing with a short, crisp, clean finish at least. Not a whole lotta pumpkin or spice. More spice than pumpkin, though.
John Harvards Punk-N-Spice;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);this is the best offering from these guys - only because of the cinn.-sugar - coating on the rim. Girls dig it. BUT the beer isn’t that good on it’s own.
John Harvards Punk-N-Spice;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sickly, apparently appropriately served with a Marguarita-style rim of molasses-ish white sugar on the pint glass. Sometimes watery, sometimes off-balance. Not enough spice. Not enough pumpkin. Not enough heft for a beer. In all, an amateur attempt. (Washington DC location)
Blind Tiger Hoptoberfest;Topeka, Kansas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Blind Tiger Brewery & Restaurant;The tap poured a clear, medium amber beverage with a small white frothy head that was mostly diminishing and left fair lacing on the glass.

Flossmoor Station Peter Pumpkinhead Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;I’m not a fan of these seasonal spiced brews...just too gimicky for me. But this one is very drinkable. The pumpkin flavor was thankfully fairly subdued beneath the predominance of the other holiday spicing...cinnamon, nutmeg, and a light earthy/floral hop note. Some base of grassiness in the background as well. OK
Flossmoor Station Peter Pumpkinhead Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Very pleasant surprise. Many pumpkin ales are either overdosed with pie spices or cloyingly sweet. The pumpkin and spice in this ale were more subtle. The amber body with frothy white head gave off hints of nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin, and brown sugar. Medium bodied. The flavor was pleasantly pumpkin pie but not aggressively so.
Flossmoor Station Peter Pumpkinhead Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;This beer announces its presence with a hearty aroma consisting of pumpkin, nutmeg, clove, and all-spice.

The body contained no carbonation, was transparent and light yellow orange in color. Its aroma contained notes of mild pumpkin spices. Its mouth feel is initially tingly with a lingering tingly aftertaste. Its flavor contained strong pumpkin spice notes and was just like in a real pumpkin pie. It gave me the beer shivers. All-in-all very nice brew.

Flossmoor Station Peter Pumpkinhead Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;This was served as a light-hazed copper/orange topped with a small tighty-whitey that fizzed away faster than expected. Cinnamon, spice (& everything nice) in flavor and aroma which totally hid the flavor of pumpkin flesh and any malts or hops that I wish I had detected. Moderately sour and spiced to finish with a dry, alcoholic astringence. Pumpkin beers are getting a little tired, I think... primarily this late in the season but in general as well. A unique concept is now way too oversaturated. On tap at Flossmoor Station, Flossmoor, IL

Brandon Gun Flint;Brandon, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brandon Brewery;[500ml bottle, gift from Maureen and Dave (who said they got if from the brewery shop) - cheers!] It looks jolly tempting - a deep chestnut brown with a good-size beige head. The smell is OK too - some nice chocolate malts there. But on tasting, it’s unexpectedly very fizzy, and the flavours are all washed out - there’s hints of chocolate and malt, along with some minerals, but overall very watery indeed. Almost no bitterness, and yet no sweetness - in fact, really very little aftertaste at all. Disappointing compared to the appearance.

Mash House Belgian Dubbel Ale;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Dubbel;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;12-ounce bottle. Amber to near brown. Off-white head dissipates pretty much right away. Great mouthfeel--has some of the bubbly rawness of an American ale, but not so much that it completely deviates from what you’d expect out of a Belgian. There’s mild fruity tartness on the tongue, but mostly a balanced sweetness--bananas and caramel are right on the nose. The finish is light. This is one of the more refreshing Belgian-style glassfuls I’ve had in a while.
Mash House Belgian Dubbel Ale;Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States;Dubbel;The Mash House Restaurant & Brewery;(entered from notes a few months old) Pours honey-copper with off-white head.

Citrus and cherry aroma, kind of tart, maybe. Some expected musty ""Belgian"" flavors, with an appealing tartness. Alcohol is well hidden. Finishes with a assertive bitterness. Sampled at Asheville Brewer’s Jam, 2005."
Pumphouse Brush Fire Belgian Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Tap at Pumphouse. Pours hazy orange with white head. Aroma is citrusy, grapefruit, hint of belgian fruit esters. Taste is crisp, easy, bitter throughout with just a touch of belgianiness. Very easy drinking and I like that it’s not overdone with the belgian esters but still has it in there. Overall, I think they did a nice job.
Pumphouse Brush Fire Belgian Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Has all the characteristics to be a top notch bpa but falls short. Thin head, orange color with a bitter finish. The smell betrays the taste. The pumphouse fell short on their interpretation of a quality BPA.
Pumphouse Brush Fire Belgian Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Crushed at the Pumphouse Spring Beer Festival. Damn. Smells like a cross between a wit and a IPA. Spicy and hoppy. Oranges and hops. Pretty unique. Dug it.
Pumphouse Brush Fire Belgian Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draft at the brewery. Medium dark amber orange colored body. Spicy green apple and coriander nose, a lot of fruit, soda-like as well... definitely has some Belgian yeast, but it’s peppery and acidic and messy throughout. A lot of apple cider acidity, some green vegetable flavors, along with some orange, mango and melon. Sloppy and messy texture, falls apart, feels like soda.

Wheaty yeast and light malt flavor, fruity and doughy, slighty sour, tart citrus notes. Light bodied and fizzy yet creamy palate.
Pumphouse Brush Fire Belgian Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;"Draft: Yellow-orange and hazy. Lightish body. Sweet and sticky malts, with notes of honey and cakey yeast. Flowery hops; delicate spice aromas in the background; very mild bitterness. Fairly easy to drink, albeit sweet. Not overly complex, but it did have some things going on."
Pumphouse Brush Fire Belgian Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draught, Pumphouse, Longmont. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted grain), lightly hoppy (herbs), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with a strong note of clove, note of lemon zest. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, heavily bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly astringent. Whew, tons of clove phenol in this one, or some other similar spice perhaps (the finish is seemingly harshly spice-bitter, so maybe they DID add something to this). It’s got that cobwebby Belgian yeast character, but this comes off as a pretty mundane and edgy beer altogether. But hey, at least it’s not crawling with banana scent, that’s a relief.
Holland Flying Dutchman;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Holland Brewery;Cask gravity at Notts BF 05. Slightly hazy orange beer. Bit syrupy, some citrus fruit, maybe not fully brewed. Got very strong grapefruit sharpness on the end. Not my favourite of the fest

La Pilsette;Gouvy, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lupulus;Pils formerly made for the brewery’s tavern, which has been closed down meanwhile. Crisp and honest example of the style, grainy and dryish with soft herbal hops in the finish.
La Pilsette;Gouvy, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lupulus;Tap, at ZBF 2006. Straw gold, moderate white head and gentle condition. Gentle sweet graininess in the nose, low mix of malty sweetness and gentle hop flavour in the mouth and an emerging fruitiness in the finish.
La Pilsette;Gouvy, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lupulus;Hand bottled Clear golden color, small white head. Parfumic, fruity, slightly flowery hoppy aroma. Refreshing, fruity, slightly papery malty flavor. Pils like hoppyness in the finish. Fresh brew, but not very interesting. Possibly an ale.
La Pilsette;Gouvy, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lupulus;(Hand-bottled) Hazy pale golden color with a small head. Honeyish, slightly sugary aroma with smooth, grassy hops.

Very fresh aroma of malt, bread and a gentle hop touch with fruitish leanings as well. Malt dominates the taste, followed by a light bitter and fruity finish.
La Pilsette;Gouvy, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Lupulus;Draught: After the Bleuette this was kind of disappointing. Pale yellow coloured. Clear. Dense white head. Has a bland hoppy and herbal nose. Is quite sweet in the flavours. Has some fresh grassy and flowery notes. There is no real bitterness in the end but more fruityness. A bit thin bodied and watery mouthfeel.

Blackstone Harvest Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Strong Ale - American;Blackstone Brewing Company;Draft at Brewpub. Pours a dark mahogany amber with an off white head. Caramel and citrusy nose. Medium bodied, but with that Sierra Nevada like clean texture. Malt back bone is strong, with notes of nuts, dark caramel, and rye. This is countered by a moderate west coast style bitterness, which is piney and citrusy, with even a hint of mint. Finish is semi dry and hoppy. Not bad. I wish Blackstone would keep an aggressively hopped beer on tap full time.
Blackstone Harvest Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Strong Ale - American;Blackstone Brewing Company;2007 Harvest ale 1.065, 40 IBU - Mt. Ranier hop varietal. The aroma was spicy and grassy with a resinous hop presence. Caramel was notable in the background with some citrusy notes. A well done aroma in terms of both hops and malt. The beer arrived clear amber brown with a low beige head which was persistent enough to lace the glass. The flavor was lightly sweet and nutty with a candylike characteristic and caramel. The hop bitterness was restrained and hop flavor was pretty low. The hop presence did not meet up with what was promised by the aroma. The finish was dry with light lasting citrus. The body was medium or just a bit above and the carbonation was moderate leaving a creamy impression on the palate. A nice beer that certainly could be more bitter. Pint at Blackstones.
Blackstone Harvest Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Strong Ale - American;Blackstone Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery: The pour was a clear dark ruby with a very, very abundant light-tan head. I was only given a small sampler glass. The glass was filled half-way with the head up to the top. The aroma was very malty with brown sugar and caramel sweetness and a slight tart. The flavour has a sweetness and tart similar to darker fruits. The sweetness also has the caramel qualities as well. Bready notes escalate as the brew passes the tongue and finishes with a slight dry bitterness. Eight hour old growler shared with NachlamSie (same day): Basically the same rating as before with slightly more subdued qualities in taste and aroma. The head is nearly non-existent with little carbonation. That’s somewhat expected being eight hours old. It’s, overall, like a lighter Barley Wine. It has very similar qualities but not as intense. I’m not completely impressed, but it is quite enjoyable.
Blackstone Harvest Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Strong Ale - American;Blackstone Brewing Company;"8 hour growler brought in by BossHossBikes, thanks man! Pours a darkish brown which is rather crystalline. Not much head is evident here. Aroma reminds me of a barleywine with sweet caramelly tobacco scents. Thin hops, bread, and dry fruit tones round things out. After a sip, I ween my opinion away from barleywine and more to brown ale, maybe a Scottish ale. The finish is bittersweet with a milky sweetness and a lingering, papery sting. Brown sugar, almonds, peanut skins, and powdered milk are hinted at. Pretty decent. I’m not sure that ""American Strong Ale"" is appropriate here. No real focus is given to the hops here, it’s all about the malts. Blackstone continues to make pretty decent beers in our sparse TN scene."
Blackstone Harvest Ale;Nashville, Tennessee, United States;Strong Ale - American;Blackstone Brewing Company;"On tap into shaker at the brewpub. Deep ruby clear in the glass with only a dusting of tan head. Nice malty smell, with a little bit of bright fruits and maple poking through the general breadiness. Malt profile is definitely forward and insistent and nicely complex, in that different malt flavorings take center stage at different times. Sugary and grinding grains at first (with maybe a little DME) aren’t the best, but subside with the carbonation into some dark grains, cranberry (without the tartness), and maybe a little licorice. The finish: much like the aftertaste of cranberry juice (the echo of tartness that, in this case, wasn’t there to begin with), with some earthy rhubarb bitterness on the back sides of the tongue making it a little dry; long. In theory, I like the cranberry aspects, and with the right food accompaniment, they might be very nice. Their near acridity, along with some of the untutored sugars, leaves this feeling just a little off, eventhough I can’t pin down exactly why."
Full Mash Ghoul;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Stout;Full Mash Brewery;Cask gravity at Notts BF 05. Black beer, thin bubbly beige head. Bit bready on aroma, some liquorice and choc. Some acids and powdery choc in mouth. OK stout, not fantastic, not awful

Shakespeare's The Tempest;Alcester, Warwickshire, England;Porter;Bard's;Redditch Winter Ales Festival 2006. Good colour and a strong typical porter aroma. But let down, I thought, by the very rich, even overpowering, roast taste.
Shakespeare's The Tempest;Alcester, Warwickshire, England;Porter;Bard's;Cask gravity at Notts BF 05. Black beer, disappearing beige head. Slightly eggy but with nice roasted malts. Touch of liquorice on end. Fine, but not enough depth

Samuel Adams Koggen;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Boston Beer Company;draft - Pours a dark, cloudy yellow with a moderate, foamy head. The aroma is of citrus fruit and spices and it has a taste to match, along with some yeast flavor. The spices were considerably less subtle than in most wheats I’ve had, but that was a good thing as they added nicely to the flavor. The finish was refreshing. This ale is very interesting. I didn’t know what to do with the plastic stir stick/pestle that was included in the glass as I didn’t care to mash anything up, but the beer was good.

Samuel Adams Koggen;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Boston Beer Company;Sampled at the brewery. As I’ve never had a koggen before, I have nothing to compare it to. Nevertheless, it is a sour lemony beer that reminded me of a watered down kindl weiss.

Watery but just not appetizing."
Samuel Adams Koggen;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Boston Beer Company;"Had it on the tour also. Supposedly, it’s an ""unfinished"" beer that you’re supposed to add your own flavors to (according to the tour guide). The guide showed us the smahser you’re supposed to use to infuse your fruit, or whatever, to the beer. It’s not bad, and its a decent idea, but the last thing i want to do is be mashing something into the bottom of my glass at the bar. That’s just me."

The taste has reasonable hops also and a thick body with the alcohol levels showing. Shame it was a bit tired as this had good potential.
Fellows Morton & Clayton Samuel Fellows Bitter;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fellows Morton & Clayton Brewhouse;Clear amber covered by a firm, creamy head from the sparkler’s pour. A straight bitter that feels quite strong for what it is. Subtle and fruity in the nose. Its well extracted maltiness procures toasty and nutty notes with whole grain breadiness. Salty, mineral water. Dry and poundable offering.
Fellows Morton & Clayton Samuel Fellows Bitter;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fellows Morton & Clayton Brewhouse;Cask conditioned at Fellows Morton & Clayton, Nottingham. Copper bronze with no head. Sweet toffee aroma, overwhelming and off putting, but the beer is little better, sweet,sticky full of caramel, awful and barely drinkable. Not nice.

Fellows Morton & Clayton Samuel Fellows Bitter;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fellows Morton & Clayton Brewhouse;"Cask conditioned - Handpump - FMC Brewpub. An amber brown coloured beer served with a sparkler. The aroma has berry fruits and a little sweet caramel. The taste is similar to the stronger Poste Haste; it has those fruity malts only in lesser quantity. However the fuller body made this a better experience of the two."
Long Valley Harvest Ale;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;I’ve been to the LVBP about 3 times in 2 years and just sampled the Harvest Ale on tap last weekend for the first time. I’m also currently finishing off a Growler of it that I brought home. Appearance: Ruby brown body with a nice 2 finger foamy head that is slightly off white in color. The glass is picking up a sheen of lacing. Smell: As the previous reviewer suggested, the sugary malt really stands out along with a dry hopped note. A bit earthy and fairly enjoyable. Taste: Earthy hops up front followed by a wave of sweet malt and a dry hop finish. Mouthfeel: Medium thin body and a tad lacking in carbonation. This category could use some improvement for sure. Drinkability: Seems low in ABV and the body is on the light side so quite drinkable. One of the better offerings I’ve had at LVBP. Recommended. BTW They currently charge $20 for a growler (bottle included) and I believe refills are $12 (might be $14) once you own the bottle and bring it back. Not bad considering they charge $4.50 from the tap. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 11-05-2008
Long Valley Harvest Ale;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;on tap-pours a white head with gold color. Aroma is malt&hops, neither dominates. Taste is malt-nutty&hops-citrus, grapefruit, mellow. OK carbonation.
Long Valley Harvest Ale;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;Disclaimer: I do not work at LVBP. On tap 10/25/05 poured by AdamSkillin. Deep gold colored ale. The fragrance of hops is very apparent, and the taste of hops is strong in this brew, but remains surprisingly not that bitter. Very smooth. Get this while you can.

Long Valley Harvest Ale;Long Valley, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Long Valley Pub and Brewery;"Disclaimer: I work at LV Brew Pub. The beer is a true beautiful golden color, not yellowish like the ""Grist Mill Golden."" Double hopped (Cascades and Willamettes), and more fragrant than bitter.

Full Sail Fall Bock;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Full Sail Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle - $1.49 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia. Appearance: Pours a dark brown body with a smallish, though slightly creamyish, beige head. Nil lacing. Smell: FS’s bottled bock smells of dark bread, modestly hinting of grain, with soft, subtle touches of brown sugar and cocoa powder backed by a dark fruitiness. Taste: Dark toasty breadiness, with sweetish accents of dark brown sugar and cocoa. A little sweet grape fruitiness follows. A light, earthy bitterness midway, maybe a bit of vague citrus. Semi-dry and still full of dark breadiness and fruit on the light finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-light carbonation. Overall: Without the sugary, heavy or boozy qualities of some, this bock is comparatively light and easy-going.
Full Sail Fall Bock;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Full Sail Brewing Company;Enjoy by 5/10/15... Picked this up tonight at the COOP... Standard pricing... Happy see it, well made German-style lagers are a favorite of mine. Poured into my FunkFest goblet... Thin tannish head.. The brew is clear, but dark and reveals only dark ruby highlights when held to a light. Nose shows good malt complexity that makes me think roasted nuts/dark toasty bread... Flavor had dark toast with a bit of roast malt that never verges on burnt.. perhaps a bit of cocoa on the finish. Medium body for the style... still good carbonation and good drinkability... Nice approachable Doppelbock that doesn’t quite show the big boned complexities of the Continental versions, but this is no slouch at all.. I dig it and will buy a 6’er instead of a single the next time I see it.
Full Sail Fall Bock;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Full Sail Brewing Company;Medium bronze with small head. Grainy malt nose, that is reserved, not very sweet. Rather bland malt flavors that don’t differentiate or meld well. Drinkable, but little character.
Full Sail Fall Bock;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Full Sail Brewing Company;On tap at the full sail brewery. Pours a clear copper color with a short lasting white head. lightly toasty malt that was kinda lost in the big hopped finish. Aroma was more of a dry grainy malt nose, sweeter then the actual taste of the beer. Just had to much hops for my taste in bocks, needed a stronger malt presence.
Full Sail Fall Bock;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Full Sail Brewing Company;Draught at Hood River brewery (in July, not fall, labelled simply as Bock): Bright amber colour. Toasty, slightly caramelly aroma. The flavour is relatively mild, and surprisingly citric/berrish, with an earthy, caramelly malt note.
Full Sail Fall Bock;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Full Sail Brewing Company;Tap at brewery. Pours a light, clear, golden color with a modest white head. Aroma is grassy hops and a bit of toasted malt. Light bodied. Decent mouthfeel, decent balance of malt and hop in flavor. Very hoppy for the bock style. Really a decent beer, just nowhere close to a bock in style, hence the lower rating.
Town Hall Wine Barrel Brown Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Deep red-brown. Nose very vinous, some chocolate. Flavor is overpoweringly vinous, the wine character runs over anything else. Some fruitiness, grapes, but it’s a lot like drinking some wine with a bit of beer added. Not impressed.
Town Hall Wine Barrel Brown Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Cask at the brewery with DilkmanMan. Big wine with a bit of raw pecan in the aroma. Flavor is almost all wine and it obscures any hint of smokiness. A failed experiment though somewhat drinkable. A technically perfect creamy palate helped a lot.
Town Hall Wine Barrel Brown Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;The brown porter from earlier this year, aged in a red wine barrel, released on October 24, 2005....I enoyed from a growler... Dense brown body, nearly opaque, lush cocoa-brown head... Fantastic aroma...sweetness and fresh mingle with roasty components...the wine character has subsumed most, if not all the porter-y characters in the nose, but it’s a wonderful blend, all told, rich and complex, very heady and rewarding... This is begun again in the flavor, with the berries and grapes fully in charge of the taste, taking over the palate, the porter mainly as base or ballast. A remarkable combination, one I like, maybe better than the wine stouts they’d offered here in the past, the lighter body of the porter making for easier drinking, considered the full flavor of the barrel’s effect. So good I nearly drank the whole thing Monday night, but, stopped halfway...I write this Tuesday afternoon, and will save the remainder as a tasty nightcap for tonight... Happy 8th Anniversary, Town Hall!
Town Hall Wine Barrel Brown Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Town Hall 8th Anniversary, Monday release: The first of the anniversary beers, woo hoo! In a stemless goblet, it sits as a pitch red color. The darkest brown you can get, but obviously red by the edges of the glass. No head. If you didn’t know the name of the beer, the aroma would give away the wine barrel part. Sweet oak and a little honey, mixed with what appears to be remnants of a merlot or cabernet. The taste is very woody to begin with, followed by loads of grapes. It seemed a little sour, like a Flemish Sour Brown almost. An earthy tanin quality comes out somewhere in the middle. There is a bit of nuttiness that seems to be from the original porter. Dry and slightly bitter finish. On the way back to work (heh heh), I noticed the wood really lingers. There didn’t seem to be much of the porter left, but the concoction was quite tasty anyway.
Propeller Pumpkin Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Propeller Brewery;"Pours clear orange gold with a small white top. Aroma is light biscuit malt with a light spice and nutmeg. Taste is non offensive, more of a golden ale with a slight spice to it. I enjoyed it mainly because it was so light handed with the nutmeg, cinnamon, spice, etc. So it worked for me but if you want a ""true"" pumpkin beer, this isn?t for you."
Propeller Pumpkin Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Propeller Brewery;"C;ear, little head. From a bottle. Nice spice. Not overly powerful. Nice balance"
Propeller Pumpkin Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Propeller Brewery;"This was a tough one to rate. On one hand, it tastes and looks great. On the other hand, it doesn’t taste or look like a pumpkin flavoured ale. It’s a super pale and clear straw-yellow with a big white head. The smell is very spicy but not really any pumpkin present, mostly cloves then nutmeg, cinnamon and black pepper. The taste, although very nice and smooth, is mostly the same; a very delicious spicy beer with hardly any pumpkin presence. It’s got a medium body, soft carbonation and a strong clove aftertaste. If they added more pumpkin taste or renamed it Clove Ale it would get a higher rating. Yummy all the same."
Propeller Pumpkin Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Propeller Brewery;"On tap .. one of the better pumpkin options though i found it to be very heavy on the spice versus the pumpkin. Quite easy drinking; strong almost cloves notes .. overall, not bad"
Propeller Pumpkin Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Propeller Brewery;330ml bottle (2013 batch) into a tumbler. Pours clear golden colour with a light, quickly dissipating head. Spicy nose, with a more subdued flavour of spice (mainly cinnamon and nutmeg). Previous years have either been far too spicy, or far too bland. 2013 is well-balanced.
Propeller Pumpkin Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Propeller Brewery;Clear blonde pour with small white head dissipating rapidly with no lacing. Aroma of spice and wheat malt. Initial bitterness followed by a bit of cinnamon and too much cloves. Can’t detect the pumpkin on the palate but a little comes though I the aftertaste.

Propeller Pumpkin Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Propeller Brewery;500ml bottle. 2010 vintage. Pours crystal clear yellow with the slightest hint of gold with a big bubbled head that leaves a little lace. Smells like a pumpkin pie, but much lower on the spice notes than previous efforts. There’s a wheat note underneath that throws the whole thing off a little. In the mouth it’s got a very watered down pumpkin feel with some underlying spice, but not enough, nowhere near enough. Finishes with a slight bitterness and an off note I can’t put a finger on.
Propeller Pumpkin Ale;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Propeller Brewery;[1897-20081209] 341mL bottle. Fruity pumpkin aroma with lots of spices. Clear, orange brown body with a long-lasting foamy off-white head. Fruity spiced grains flavour. Medium body. Quite nice. (c/o OKBeer)

Bersaglier Scottish Ale;San Martín, Argentina;Scottish Ale;Bersaglier Cerveza Artesanal;"Bottle in Cossab, BsAs - Thankfully not like most other ""Scotch"" ales in that it’s not smokey or phenolic - or, at least, not overpoweringly so. A rich red colour, it has the usual toffee-maltiness of the Irish Red style with additional bitterness and lots of complexity and flavour. The finish is surprisingly bitter and toffee/malty - it’s quite unclassifiable to me, but still an excellent drinking beer."
Bersaglier Scottish Ale;San Martín, Argentina;Scottish Ale;Bersaglier Cerveza Artesanal;Bottled at Cossab, Buenos Aires. Clear nut brown. Aggresive plastic phenols kicks me in the nostrils. Sweetish with clean, rounded mouthfeel. A bad surprise knowing that their oatmeal stout is very good. If you get beneath the phenols there might be a good beer down there, but who knows?

There is mild artificial taste to the fruitiness, but overall is pretty well done. Some hops linger in the finish. M: Pretty light-bodied with a good amount of carbonation and low alcohol character.

Nodding Head Tart;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Nodding Head Brewery;Hazy dark brown pour covered by basically no head at all. It plays in the acetic and chocolatey department, possibly trying to hint at the Belgian oud bruins, and along the way suggesting oak notes more typical of red ales, all the while spending some time with figgy and grapey entertainment. Rather short flavour strikes as rather simple, yet remaining pleasant at what it’s there. Light and thin body, vinegary sour, watery and peppery. Doesn’t seek to far, but focuses on its strengths.

Rocky Bay Pumpkin Ale;Rockland, Maine, United States;Flavored - Other;Rocky Bay Brewing Company;On draught at the brewpub, 10/23/2005. A light peachy-soft orange, warm apricot and tangerine toned, with a lovely haze and a small, off-white head that is quickly receding to ring. Aroma of light pumpkin flesh, some lightly sweet base malts, but mostly, a strong cinnamon and/or nutmeg presene that dries out the aroma a good deal. A bit of an earthy, raw feeling to it, with a strong aroma right down to the last drop. Flavor continues with the cinnamon and nutmeg, but mostly on the finish. At the start there is light pumpkin and malt flavor, a touch of bitterness from the hops and a nice crispness towards the end. Finally, the nutmeg and cinnamon come out and clear the palate, leaving a spicy, dry feeling, almost like you just took a mouthfeel of powdered cinnamon/nutmeg. Still, the mouthfeel shows low carbonation, an ample body, though medium-light in sweetness, with a very drinkable nature. I usually don’t like heavy pumpkin pie spices in my pumpkin ales, but this one I enjoyed.

Fort Street The Kaisers India Lager;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Fort Street Brewery;Tap: bright orange with huge rocky head. Great lacing. Aroma has a huge citrus zest kick to it. Lots of orange and grapefruit zest. Has a residuel pine resin aroma hiding in the background. Flavor has the same huge citrus zest to it, tiny bit of malt sweetness towards the finish. Would pass for a fine ipa. Assuming it was fermented cooler/lager? Certainly doesn’t resemble a pale lager.
Fort Street The Kaisers India Lager;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Fort Street Brewery;On tap: Excellent orange and citrus hop aroma. Pours a mostly transparent orange with a touch of haze and a nice white head with decent retention and great lacing. Lots of sweet orange up front with a big grapefruit hop finish. Listed as a pale lager, but really comes across as a real hoppy, but well balanced IPA. Very nice. Has to be the best Pale Lager I’ve ever had.

Sainsbury's West Country Cider - Medium Sweet;Holborn, Greater London, England;Apple Cider;Sainsbury's;Pale gold with moderate carbonation. Syrupy apple pulp aroma. Flavour was also very sweet with sugary fruit and a thin finish. Poor.
Sainsbury's West Country Cider - Medium Sweet;Holborn, Greater London, England;Apple Cider;Sainsbury's;I suggested the Sainsburys Medium Dry Cider was very sweet and wondered what this would be like in comparison. The answer is that it is remarkably similar. Bright copper gold. Quite an acid fruity aroma. Sweet taste with just a touch of sourness. If anything a little blander than the other one.
Sainsbury's West Country Cider - Medium Sweet;Holborn, Greater London, England;Apple Cider;Sainsbury's;Colour is golden. Floral aroma like handcream. Taste is sour and bitter with some sweetness. Fizzy. Good for a picnic in the park, it will chill you right out.
Sainsbury's West Country Cider - Medium Sweet;Holborn, Greater London, England;Apple Cider;Sainsbury's;Bottled, pasteurised. Yellow gold, carbonated. This is very sweet and sticky with a resinous fructose taste. Does make a reasonable gravy though when no one would drink it. Nasty.
Sainsbury's West Country Cider - Medium Sweet;Holborn, Greater London, England;Apple Cider;Sainsbury's;"Bottled. One of the few Westons that I find too cloying; sugariness overplays the other flavours and ends up unbalancing."
Sainsbury's West Country Cider - Medium Sweet;Holborn, Greater London, England;Apple Cider;Sainsbury's;Bottle. Golden and very still. Aromas are very sweet and syrupy. So sweet that the apple doesn’t really shine. Flavours are sweet apple with wood and sugar with more sugar on top. There is some tartness and there are caramel notes but they are consumed by...sweetness. Sickly.
Sainsbury's West Country Cider - Medium Sweet;Holborn, Greater London, England;Apple Cider;Sainsbury's;Bottle (from Sainsburys. Sweet and fizzy with little character. Not a complex rich sweetness with redeeming features just plain old sweet.
Sainsbury's West Country Cider - Medium Sweet;Holborn, Greater London, England;Apple Cider;Sainsbury's;Bottle from Sainsburys. An aroma of syrupy apple juice and a touch of sourness. To taste this is oversweet with unpleasent sourness and vinegar character. Lacks balance, authentic cider flavour or the nice woody character that gives Westons a slight leg up over commercial producers. Quite horrible, drainpour.
Sainsbury's West Country Cider - Medium Sweet;Holborn, Greater London, England;Apple Cider;Sainsbury's;This is another of sainsburies quite good range of beers and ciders. Aroma is very ripe apples with loads of sweetness, a little overpowering with the sweetness infact to serious toffee apple stage, though still ok. Taste is similarly ripe apples, however the sweetness isnt as bad as i thought it might be, with gentler carbonation than expected. The medium dry in this range is better, not still not bad for a supermarket cider.
A1A Ale Works Oktoberfest;Saint Augustine, Florida, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;A1A Ale Works (Craftworks);"This is a fantastic Octoberfest ale, one of the best I have tried this season. This might be advertised as a lager, but it has the beautiful amber colouring and flavour of an ale; with the refreshing qualities of a lager. Hugely drinkable with satisfying flavours and palate. Superb :-)"
A1A Ale Works Oktoberfest;Saint Augustine, Florida, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;A1A Ale Works (Craftworks);The brewmasters at A1A are right on target with this year’s version. I mean, it was so much better than last year’s offering which I did not like at all. This Octoberfest came from the tap in a thick pint mug with a nice reddish-copper hue along with a creamy white head that stuck to sides for a long time. Surpisingly there was very little lacing. The aroma was very subltle with some bready hints. The first sip revealed a very smooth caramel-malty sweetness with maybe just a touch of citrus followed by a slight hoppy finish. I reallly had lots of fun drinking this marvelous brew while grooving to the sounds of the Christopher Dean Band. What a great combination!!!!!
A1A Ale Works Oktoberfest;Saint Augustine, Florida, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;A1A Ale Works (Craftworks);Draft at brewpub. Poured a brown hue with an average frothy off-white head that was lasting with fair lacing. Good roasted malt and sweet aroma. Medium to full body. Very good well balanced flavor of malt and a bitter sweet finish. Good brew.
Millys Tavern T.N.T. Barleywine;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Bottle from 2004. Dark reddish-brown a few off-white bubbles on the surface. Sweet, malty, fruity, sugary caramel aroma. Loads of sugary malt flavors, dried fruits, and a strong hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was soft and a bit syrupy with just a bit of carbonation, with a strong astringent bitter finish. Really good.
Millys Tavern T.N.T. Barleywine;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Clear dark copper body with no head to speak of. A whole lot of alcohol in an oily body with maple syrup and brown sugar flavours. The carbonation was too soft and the body just didn’t provide enough support for the strong alcohol taste. Abrupt finish with a lack of hops presence. Syrupy alcohol after-taste. My only deception at this otherwise excellent brewpub. Ironically the only bomb there was the TNT.
Millys Tavern T.N.T. Barleywine;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;[tap] Pours a dark brownish/red color, with a coarse off-white head.

Very aggressive hoppy.
Dundee Festive Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Well....although there's nothing exciting going on here, it is well worth the price (on sale at Publix for $5.99). Not as hoppy as a Tumbler or some other seasonal browns. I don't remember caring too much for the regular Dundee Honey Brown, but I would get this again for party beer or just to have some economy lying around. Tastes like the basic honey-brown base but with some extra spice, hops, and less honey to create a better balance. Was gonna pass on this one, and was almost fooled by the low price ...but glad I tried.
Dundee Festive Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Aroma is spices, malts and mild caramel. The flavor is malts/caramel, fruit, mild/medium earthiness and a mix of spices and slightly sour in the finish.

Dundee Festive Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);It has a nice deep reddish amber colored body with good clarity. On top sits soft light tan head of about medium size. Head retention is ok as it slowly fades to just a very thin wispy covering. Lacing is minimal and very slick sliding down with the head. The aroma has a nose of holiday spice, cinnamon being the standout, as well as sweet dark malt with just a touch of hops. The flavor has a pleasant touch of cinnamon and nutmeg inside of a sweet malty body with a slight hint of orange peel and citrus acidity in the background. Its hop character is very light and modest. Its spicy flavors carry on nicely into the finish. The texture has a creamy smooth feel with a good balance of carbonation and a solid, fairly well rounded body.
Dundee Festive Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Rated on 5-16-2012. This bottled beer pours a small very fizzy ivory head that mostly diminishes, transparent orange body, very fizzy, fast rising carbonation observed, and no lacing. The aroma is malt, citrus orange, sweet, spicy, and cinnamon. The flavor is sweet, caramel malt, spicy, cinnamon, and a semi-dry finish. The mouthfeel is carbonation and this beer is light-medium bodied. Overall, this beer lacks character, no WOW factor and a so-so beer.
Dundee Festive Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle. Vegetal malt and nutmeg/cinnamon/clove aroma. Vegetal caramel malt and spice flavor. Medium body and carbonation. I’m finding I’m not a fan of these highly spiced winter beers.
Dundee Festive Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a medium sized head of foamy finely sized tan colored bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a typically carbonated transparent dark orange colored body and a thick foamy lacing. The mild aroma was spicy cloven and herb. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The nice flavor contained notes of spices and mild hops. Delicious not too strong and one I would certainly buy again.
Dundee Festive Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle at home in London. Pours clear, caramel-ruby with a fine, wimpy off-white foam. Nose holds some toasty caramel, rich bread. Medium sweet flavor, some toasty sugars, hints of tangy cherries, a bit of toffee, sweet bread, fruit cake, very light cinnamon. Light to medium bodied with fine, tingly carbonation. Modestly sweet finish, plenty of caramelised fruits, mildly tangy cherries and other berries, some light toffee, background spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. Decently well rounded. It’s kind of nice that the spice character really takes a backseat. In general, pretty well nuanced and quite drinkable.
Dundee Festive Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Dundee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz bottle: Pours a clear pale orange bronze with a spotty-lacing white head. Has a light cinnamon spiced nose with a touch of light caramel malt. Starts with average fullness and a light sugary sweetness with some musky spice balance and earthy bittering hops with a hint of butter before a drier bittersweet finish. Could be a little cleaner, but not a bad attempt at the style.

Rock Bottom Warrenville Demon Sweat Bitter;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rock Bottom Warrenville;Amber pour with small head. Nose is of hops, some malt, spices and a hint of milk chocolate. Flavor is strange, very bitter, but not hopped up bitterness, very carbonated, doesnt go down easy. Glad to try it, but not something I’d get overly excited about to try again.
Rock Bottom Warrenville Demon Sweat Bitter;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rock Bottom Warrenville;On tap at the brewery. Translucent dark amber brew with a malty look to it. Non- existent head after a short time. Although it claims bitter in the title, it really seems to be a classic amber.

Skytop Barrel 28 Octoberfest;Kingston, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Skytop Steak House and Brewing Company;This batch is head and shoulders above last year’s. Draft at Brewpub. I had two with dinner. The first sat at the bar for a bit as our waitress was busy tending a wide scattering of tables. The second had a nice tight pale white head. Nose was whispy and parting. Quite pretty in glass as I got up and walked about with it. the lighting at the dining area was pretty dim so I felt I needed to go the extra distance to get a decent look at it. Worth the walkabout. A nice deep golden. Rounded Medium malty body with stronger toned hops. A nice balance. Lacing is delicate and medium lived. This baby goes down smooth and lets you know all about it. a tinge of alkaline at the finish. One of the best Octoberfests that I have ever tasted. My wife says the lacing looks like spider spit. This is my Toast to MJ’s Passing Brew. Thanks so much for showing us what else is out there!
Skytop Barrel 28 Octoberfest;Kingston, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Skytop Steak House and Brewing Company;(tap at brewpub) Clear bronze body with a small off-white head. The earthy malts on the nose were inviting. The taste was a bit light and like most of their other beers the body was rather thin, borderline watery. The malts didn’t have a roasted flavour, in fact they felt very raw. Basically this was just some raw malt, some light caramel and some dark beans I could have done without. Drinkable but forgettable. Barrel 2.8
Skytop Barrel 28 Octoberfest;Kingston, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Skytop Steak House and Brewing Company;Any first impressions? -A ring of foam surrounds the deep caramel copper. -Tiny red fruit and whispering caramel maltiness make up a clean, but complacent aroma. -Cranberry fruitiness, bready malts, and caramel sweetness all lay low, but efficiently garnish the palate. -The lean maltiness, as in most their beers tasted that day, is very drinkable, if uneventful. What if you dig deeper? -Maltiness earns more respect than the frail hoppiness, but I don’t see malt lovers really reach out for this one. -The finish is a fading of the aforementioned flavors, so pretty soporific. -Another clean lager from Skytop, but another which I found unmemorable. On tap at the brewpub.
Skytop Barrel 28 Octoberfest;Kingston, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Skytop Steak House and Brewing Company;On tap @ Brewpub. Ok nose, Yeasty.

Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #1;Houston, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;From Jan 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with JDV. Thanks Deniz! It pours from 12oz bottle a cloudy rusty brown with a small tannish head of foam. The smell has a lot of roasted malt, caramel malt, and a touch of fruit. The taste up front brings a huge dose of caramel along with some roasted malt, toffee, and some grain. It has a very thick mouthfeel to it and the carbonation is fairly light. The finish is sweetish and lingers for quite some time. The alcohol shows itself slightly in the taste and more boldly during and after the swallow. I understand that this is Saint Arnold's first attempt at a BWSA and it *is* pretty good. It just seems a bit rough around the edges and is not as easy to drink as other BWSAs I've had before. Still, it's a good effort. Thanks again, Deniz!
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #1;Houston, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Bottle shared with father-in-law. This beer is over 7 years old but hasn’t held up very well. Dark amber appearance. Smell’s of cherry and port wine. Taste of cherry or plum maybe a little oxidized from the age. Overall not a bad beer maybe aged to long.
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #1;Houston, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Butterscotch aroma molasses malt. Murky coffee with huge chunks.

Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #1;Houston, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;From the saint Arnold divine reserve vertical tasting @ the common table on Dallas. This beer pours a deep reddish amber with a thin off white head. The aromas are musk, fruits. The mouthfeel is sweet and sticky and slightly alcoholic. Really has a large hop character for a barley wine. This aged really well! Cheers1
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #1;Houston, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;"A: The pour is a murky brownish color with just about no head. Some scattered light khaki bubbles. S: This beer is fairly oxidized, but still some brown sugar, toffee, and caramel. A few hints of dark fruits, too. T: Still a surprising amount of piney bitterness to this beer. Toffee, stale brown sugar, and some light chocolate and caramel. A bit of cardboard, as well. M: The body is medium and so is the carbonation. D: Not much left worth drinking, here. Lots of oxidation and not in the good, ""chocolatey"" sense."
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #1;Houston, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Bottled. An unclear brown beer with a brown head. The aroma has notes of malt, caramel, and alcohol. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt, caramel, alcohol, brown sugar, and nuts, leading to a dry woody finish. Thanks Papsoe for sharing.
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #1;Houston, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Bottle, with HUGE thanks to Zinister. You rock bro! Hazy reddish hue. Lovely aroma. Dark raisins and plum, wood and vanilla. Taste is wonderful. Aged wood notes with ripened fruit. Dark plum with a touch of raisins. Vanilla alcohol rounds out the finish. Finish dries but has the fantastic sweetness that previous was the beer. Lovely.
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #1;Houston, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to Zinnister. Aroma is Peppermint, malts, alcohol, chocolate, cinnamon, and dark fruit. Wow, a lot to smell. Taste is more peppermint (really?) and lots of roasted malts. Finish is dark and delicious.
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #1;Houston, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Pours a deep brown into the glass with a small beige head. Aroma is dark fruit with a bit of chocolate. Flavor has a surprisingly large amount of chocolate present. Really tasty, but definitely much different than the barley wines I’ve had.
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #1;Houston, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;12oz bottle courtesy of KAggie97 poured into a snifter. Pours a dark, murky brown with hints of orange around the edges with a decent beige head that leaves a collar and spotty lacing on the way down. The aroma is fairly mellow with lots of sweet caramel malts and even hints of citrus aroma. There are some dark fruits in the nose as well. The taste is a tad better than the aroma and has a quick (and faint) hop hint up front. Outside of that, it’s really about the sweet caramel malts and toffee with some raisins and a bit of woody dryness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation and very smooth and slick going down. This is a decent barleywine that has definitely held up well over time. It’s not as complex as some of the world-class barleywines out there but it’s definitely drinkable despite probably seeing better days.

Max Imperial IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Max Lager's;Pours a slightly hazed copper with an excellent head. Pine blends with peach in the aroma. The flavor brings the caramel malt to the front and the hops meld with the malt sweetness to create a touch of citrus fruit and conifer candy.
Max Imperial IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Max Lager's;On draught at Max Lager’s on P-tree. Poured a nice amber-orange colour, with noticeable haze. Virtually no crown whatsoever with wispy lacing. Aroma is very floral and citrus, but not as hoppy as I would have expected for an Imperial IPA. Nice drinkable nature to it, with a delicate hop character. Extremely nice balance of malts to hop. Palate starts out thin and remains thin throughout, but with the bitterness increasing through the smooth hoppy finish. Definitely would not have been able to guess that it was 11% ABV. More of a regular run-of-the-mill IPA than Imperial IPA. Very nice beer I’d drink again, though.
Max Imperial IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Max Lager's;Pours a hazy copper orange with a thin, wispy off-white head. Big fresh citrus hoppy aroma has a nice, sweet caramel malty balance. Body starts lightly syrupy sweet turning slightly harsher and more bitter toward a very warming finish. A little too bitter and alcoholic and doesn’t have enough malt balance. Perhaps over-attenuated.
Max Imperial IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Max Lager's;Draft @ the Mall of GA location. Nice appreance, but no noticable hop nose. This beer was very green and very watered-down. Like a weak IPA as opposed to an imp. IPA. Definitely did not notice the 11% alcohol. A weak example of the style IMHO.
Max Imperial IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Max Lager's;Nice deal at $5.50 for a full pint. Draft @ the downtwon location. Hazy dark orange-amber color. Minimal off-white head and clear oily legs. Hoppy aroma of both grapefruit juice and the grapefruit pith. Sweet caramel is underneath. Alcohol is very well hidden in the aroma. Piney hop notes appear as the beer warms up. The flavor was citrusy from the start with the malt almost hidden underneath. Hop bitterness ramps up starting from the middle of the flavor and it keeps growing through the very long dry bitter finish. Some warmth but for 11% the alcohol is very well hidden. The beer just gets to a medium body. The beer produces nice fresh hop cone burps. Mmmm..hop cone burp.
Max Imperial IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Max Lager's;This is a stellar high gravity IPA. Great full malt character shines through fresh hop explosion. Heavily dryhopped, floral , citrusy, and gives you that warming feeling of....uh....alcohol. Be careful. this is a great example of probably my favorite style.
Max Imperial IPA;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Max Lager's;On tap at the downtown Atlanta location. Pours a light orange, with a pleasant, sticky white head with thick lacing. Fresh, but not overly prominent floral aroma with a hint of mint. Flavor is not overdone, light citrusy hoppiness, some mint in there and a bit of nectarines. Some malty nuttiness adds a bit of balance. Mouthfeel is pleasantly thick. Pretty decent.

Times Square Oatmeal Stout;New York, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Times Square Brewery;The worst best beer at a brewpub that I think I’ve ever had. A little fruity coffee coldwater aroma. Dark rootbeer brown, clear. lactose sweet, watery cocoa. Flat and watery. Simplistic.

Pleasant resiny hops aroma with some grain coming through as well -- a bit mild but nice. Flavour’s a little grainier and biscuitier then I would like with the hops showing more in the finish -- still good though. Decent bitter finish. Average bodied. Not bad though not necessarily something I would get again, not with the selection Coles has.
Chelsea Catskill Hop Harvest Ale;Bronx, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;On tap @ Coles Buffalo NY. Very good APA. Nice hop aroma & flavor.

Günther-Bräu Bockbier;Burgkunstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Privatbrauerei Günther;500ml brown bottle. It pours a nice amber color with a foamy white head. The head dissipated pretty quickly with a bit of lace. The smell is like dough and caramel with a hint of alcohol. It is simple, but effective. The flavor is dough, caramel, and a nice bit of fruitiness with pear and apple being the main flavors. There is a smidge of bitterness over this with mild alcoholic burn. Overall this is a solid bockbier, not the best, but not the worst. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 08-19-2010 04:17:23

Town Hall Barrel Aged Coffee Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Thanks again to Hopdog. Pours deep dark brown, nearly opaque with thin tan ringing head.

Town Hall Barrel Aged Coffee Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tasted from Growler acquired in trade with robertsreality (big thanks!). Poured a dark brown (almost black) color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of light vanilla, wood, and ground coffee. Tastes of stronger wood, coffee, roast, light vanilla and some chocolate. The coffee was not as strong as I remember the regular coffee porter was. Some lacing left on the glass. Smooth body.

Pours a darke brown almost black with a small tan head. Slight lacing. Aroma of coffee, chocolate and vanilla. For any of you who have been to Hershey Park and have gone through the ""chocolate factory tour"", that is what I was getting for the aroma. Flavor was more coffee with lots of wood and also some chocolate."
Town Hall Barrel Aged Coffee Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Town Hall 8th Anniversary, Wednesday release: It looked damn near spot on to mud, just a very vague hint of red around the top edges. No head. Solid hit of bourbon and vanilla on the nose. The taste is an interesting spectrum. It started out with the expected bourbon, oak and vanilla. After a few sips, a very lightly roasted coffee rolled out. About halfway through the glass, the sweet malt became apparent, but a bitter chocolate offset it. Towards the end, there was almost a hint of tobacco. It seemed to really mellow out at the finish.
Prairie Rock Hefeweizen;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;This beer is just adequate as a hefe. Nothing more. Poor mouthfeel (thin) not much head (seems to be their style) and not a whole heck of a lot of flavor. I normally drink Hefe from the top 10 listing here on RB - so this one rates REALLY poorly compared to the German ones. It’s not bad - it’s just not GOOD.
Prairie Rock Hefeweizen;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;This is perhaps the cloudiest hefeweizen that I’ve ever had. The body is pale straw in color with a modest white head that laces heavily. The aroma was sweet and yeasty with and had a lightly tart wheat. In flavor it was more like an American wheat a hint of clove. The banana taste finally emerged in the finish. Prairie Rock Brewing Company, Elgin, IL

Prairie Rock Hefeweizen;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;"This was the ""brewmasters special"" a the time I was there. Cloudy golden with no head. The nose was actually very sweet smelling with lots of bannanas and yeast. The taste again was sweet with esters, bannannas, yeast and just a tinge of barley or canvas-potato-sac to it. Not very interesting really but very sweet. I kind of wonder if it was supposed to be so sweet."
Dominion The Chief's Spezial Rauschbier;Dover, Delaware, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);"An authentic, delicious rauchbier or ""smoked beer"". Rauchbier is a very traditional, speciality German beer style, that is rooted in the Northern Bavarian beer city of Bamburg. Before modern kilning methods came about, all malt was dried over a fire, giving beer a smoky aroma and flavor. This tradition has continued in Bamburg where a portion(or all is some cases) of the malt is smoked over a beechwood fire. This addition of smoked malt adds an amazing salty/sooty, smoke character to the beer, and makes rauchbier one of the beer world’s most interesting styles. The Chief’s Spezial Rauchbier is based on OD’s Octoberfest, which is a marzen by style. Marzen is a hearty, malty, nutty, smooth and clean lager. A portion of beechwood smoked malt is added to the grain bill, and this makes for an outstanding smoked lager. A little bit of beechwood smoked malt goes a long way, and OD was cautious enough not to be too heavy handed with the smoked malt, making this beer a very drinkable, very delicious rauchbier. It has lots of good smoked malt aroma and flavor, and an outstanding, malty and nutty base. The Chief’s Spezial Rauchbier pours to a beautiful, bright, deep amber color with a thick white head that fades, and a nice bit of carbonation. The nose on this beer is excellent, with lots of good nutty malt aromas, paired with sooty/smoky aromas. The palate is firm, with lots of good toasty and nutty malt flavor. This beer is very polished with a very nice clean body, making for such a drinkable beer. The Chief’s Spezial Rauchbier finishes with more good toasty and malty flavors up front, then ends with a very pleasing, salty/smoky finish that lingers, and lets you know you have had a good smoked lager. This beer will quickly grow on you, and you will find yourself wanting just one more. A very well done rauchbier, with nice smoke aromas and flavors, that meld well with the toasty and malty character of this beer. I would have liked just a touch more smoke character in this beer, but was very pleased with the effort. This beer reminded me some what of the legendary Spezial Raucbier of Bamburg, more so than Schlenkerla Rauchbier which is much more intense in its smoked character(100% rauch malt is used). I think OD didn’t want to make this one too smoky, as rauchbier has a very select audience. This draught only product retails for about $3.25 a pint, and $6 a 2 liter growler, and can be only found on draught at the brewpub for a short time."
Dominion The Chief's Spezial Rauschbier;Dover, Delaware, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);(draft) Small beige head atop a clear copper body. Aroma is moderately sweet, caramel, some chocolate, light smoke. Taste is moderately sweet, caramel, some smoke, light chocolate, lemon. Medium body. Very accessible smoke beer -- very mild in its smoke characteristics. That being said, I find it pleasant but nothing standout.
Dominion The Chief's Spezial Rauschbier;Dover, Delaware, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);4 oz. sample of Chief’s Spezial Rauchbier at the brewpub. Clear golden-copper body with a filmy, just off-white head which sustained for some time. Aroma is a nice blend of smoke, spicy Noble hops, and sweet malt. Flavor suggests both smoky tarry tea and smoked oysters with sweet, earthy, and slightly briny elements. Good malt character and some emergent hop flavor and bitterness. Well-integrated and tasty. This is the beer I went home thinking about. I dig it.
Dominion The Chief's Spezial Rauschbier;Dover, Delaware, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);"On tap at OD, labeled as ""The Chief’s Imperial Rauchbier"". Pours a clear copper with a quickly fading off-white head. Aroma of caramel and some smoke, not a whole lot though. Flavor has notes of toasted malt, caramel, peat/smoke and noble hops. Bold and flavorful. Pleasantly sweet, well-balanced hop bitterness on the back end. Very full, round and creamy smooth on the the palate with lively carbonation. Very nice."
Dominion The Chief's Spezial Rauschbier;Dover, Delaware, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Available only on draft at the brewpub, The Chief’s Spezial Rauschbier emulates Schlenkerla. While lacking some of the original’s yeasty complexity, the Spezial achieves a very nice smoke flavor with smoked-ham undertones. Not very hoppy, but this style is all about the malt.
Goose Island Second Hand Smoked;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Too smokey for me. Drank on draft at GI- Wrigley. Pours brown with some ruby highlights and spare head. If you can get past the smoke the is some flavor of raisin, plums and soy sauce.
Goose Island Second Hand Smoked;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);draught. Pours a semi cloudy dark copper. The aroma is mild overall, but sports a hefty amount of bacon, campfire, and a modest caramelized sweetness. This is very, very smooth and easy to drink while still maintaining a respectable amount and balance of flavors. It’s pretty meaty with a tasty, bready foundation. If ever there was a session rauchbier, this is it. I thought it was interesting that more distinct and isolated bacon/smoke qualities were here than in their smokED. note: the description on the menu described 80% smoked malt and an abv. of just over 4%.
Goose Island Second Hand Smoked;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);I guess I liked this beer a lot more than most people. On tap at Goose on Clybourn. The aroma was of overpowering smoke, like you are sitting by a campfire. The beer poured brown with a thin off white head. Nice smoked flavor with a little bit of caramel and malt. For some reason I was not expecting a lot out of this beer, but I really enjoyed it. Can’t wait to have the Imperial Smoked Brown Goose though.
Goose Island Second Hand Smoked;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);rating from memory, poured muddy brown with little head, nose was pretty smokey. flavor was fine it’s just way too thin. this is sorta like a smoked small beer. quaffable.
Goose Island Second Hand Smoked;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampled at GI. Pours a muddy brown color. The aromas come off as lots of smoke, very campfire like. When I tasted it, it was hard to get over the thin watery body, not something you usually associate with a smoked beer. Beyond that you did get a nice mouthfull of smoke a little carmel and hop bitterness.
Goose Island Second Hand Smoked;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampled at GI Clybourn location. 3.8 abv. Pours brown (deep clear red when held up to light) with an off-white head. Instense smoky aroma, which is fine with me. Flavor is dominated by smoked beechwood then comes notes of caramel and light grassiness at the end. Very light bodied with soft carbonation. Starts off tasty but ends a bit watery. Overall, solid.
Goose Island Second Hand Smoked;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Clybourn. Poured a hazy, deeper iced tea brown with a short & creamy beige cap. Nose picked up somewhat watered-down smoked peat (pretty sure it was supposed to), caramel, and hints of meat... really well done. Smoky chocolate, caramel, and peat in the flavor.. mild perfumey bitterness surrounded the mouth... great smoky caramel finish. Carbonation was a tad too high.. very light on the palate.. flavors hit the right tastebuds, though. Good stuff.
Goose Island Second Hand Smoked;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Smokey brown color that was semi-cloudy. Smells like Pledge. Smokey flavor FOR REAL. Smooth. Not too hoppy. Light carbonation. I clearly do not like beer that tastes like a smokey fireplace.
Goose Island Second Hand Smoked;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at Clybourne. Nice reddish brown lager with a thin white hed. Faint barley sugar in aroma, not very smokey. In mouth, very striking smoked wood, resinous and pleasant. Lighter bodied but surprinsgly good surprise. Nov. 10, 2005.
Goose Island Second Hand Smoked;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft: Orange tinted ruby. Silky white bubbles cover the class. Saliva inducing scents of tangy smoked jerky and plums invade the nose. Lightly chalky and nutty. Hard-edged carbonation. Opens with fruity hop accents along with some juicy slickness which harmonize with the earthy smoke. Somewhat salty. So flavorful, yet relaxed and dangerously quaffable, with a full, multilayered soft breadiness along with a moist pinch of depth lending tobacco. Smoke takes a backseat to the seemingly endless array of malts, as they take on bits of glazed sweetness and a firm cookie presence. Rigid chalkiness highlights the peppery hop accents and anise dusted melon. Bready malts and honeydew melon accompany the ghostlike smoke in the finish. Talk about a session brew that sustains. Spectacular.
Goose Island Imperial SmokED Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Had on tap after a tour at Clybourn. Nose is like sitting at a campfire and the flavor is sweet like malt but also the smoke hits you and ends like smoked bacon with a slight alcohol astringency... it’s delicious and very strange at the same time
Goose Island Imperial SmokED Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Dark brown color with a smallish lid of off-white small bubbles. Smoked pale malt scents waft upward. Some hints of fruit and cocoa also mingling. Smooth feel, nearly a rye type slickness. Smoked figs dipped in light caramel come to mind. Some hints of molasses and apple wood. Solid smoked brew.
Goose Island Imperial SmokED Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On draft at Goose Island Clybourn. Appearance is a dark brown/black hue, layer of dense white cream sustains, thick lacing. Smell is mostly smoke and roast malts, hints of brown sugar, chocolate, and light hops. Taste is initially light smoke malts, transitions to some roast/coffee/chocolate malts, earthy grass hops mingle with smoked meats and finishes with alcohol warming. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, smooth slightly viscous texture, prickly carbonation. Drinkability is moderate, this is a lightly smoked beer dominated by meaty flavors and alcohol, it would be tough to drink too much of this one.
Goose Island Imperial SmokED Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Very dark brown with red hues around the edges. Beige head with some lacing and retention. Smokey, bacon, roasty, charcoal, reminds me of BBQ and campfires. In the taste I got smoke, bacon, charcoal, caramel, and cherries. Low carbonation and medium body. I could drink tons of this, thankfully we had a growler to consume courtesy of General_Gao. Hope they make this again.
Goose Island Imperial SmokED Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft. Dark brown in color.

Goose Island Imperial SmokED Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);In short: A fruity and very smoky brown ale (too complex for a true “In Short:” description) How: Tap at brewpub (Clybourn location) The look: Brown body with a small beige head In long: Lots (and I mean LOTS) of smoke on the nose. Very fruity with raisins, black cherries and more soaked in mollasses. Nutty flavours started to come out as the beer warmed up along with some milk chocolate. Those fresh green hops in the finish were the cherry on the sundae. From start to finish I had a woody sensation like that of an oak barrel aged beer. Lively carbonation. Having all those flavours coexist so harmoniously is quite a feat. This truly is a Smoked like no other, unless you order a second pint in which case it will probably be a Smoked like your next/previous Smoked.
Goose Island Imperial SmokED Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at Clybourn.

Great stuff.
Goose Island Imperial SmokED Brown Goose;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft… DLD’08… This beer rocks!… Pitch black ale with a small, creamy, beige head. The aroma is of beechwood smoke. There’s some chocolate in there as well, but it’ almost totally eclipsed by that wonderful, wonderful smoke. Full-bodied and velvety with prickly carbonation. Sweet, smoky and chocolaty up front, but moderate bitterness outlasts all else. Smoky, bittersweet, chocolaty finish. Awesome brew!
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #12 - Imperial Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Harpoon Brewery;16-Mar-14 (22-oz foil- and crown-capped bottle, Bottled 17-Oct-05: Obtained in trade with Rastacouere, thanks David!) Having just had the amazing Triticus after some ten years of cellaring, this Imperial Stout, which is just almost as old, is pretty damn delicious too. The beer is black and opaque in color and pours less than half an inch of tan head that settles to a ring and cirrus-cloud sheet. The enticing aromas are sweet and wonderfully malty, with further notes of tobacco, smoked jerky, and prune. These aromas lead nicely into savory flavor of sweet, dark, dried fruit like prune and fig, some cigar, molasses, toffee, dark chocolate, tobacco, grilled meat, and woodsy earth. The beer is between medium-full and full bodied, so let's call it full-minus, but the weight seems fine for the style, especially given its age. Carbonation is medium, and though the beer is fairly sweet, there's a touch of acidity and a slight dryness in the finish so the beer doesn't come close to being cloying on the palate. Overall, I don't know how this beer was fresh, but in its late stage of life, this beer is pretty terrific. Too bad I opened it alone because I wish I could have shared it.
Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #12 - Imperial Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Harpoon Brewery;Bottle at Paul’s for the Blind Stout tasting.

Harpoon 100 Barrel Series #12 - Imperial Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Harpoon Brewery;A: The pour is essentially black in color with a thin layer of khaki colored foam. S: A little bit of soy sauce followed by roasted malt and coffee. Some sweet and dark chocolate notes with a hint of licorice. There is a definite burnt sugar aroma, perhaps some graham cracker. T: This was sweeter than expected. Chocolate and roasted malt with molasses and soy sauce. A bit of coffee and maybe even a little vinous, sort of a port type oxidation to it.

Bubble gum, vodka, roast, brandy. Good complexity, but not really that enticing. Pour has zero head. Very smooth palate, though not creamy. Still too much fruitiness getting in the way, residual sweetness. This definitely couldve been fermented out more and become IMO a much better beer. Still, it’s not too bad.

There is a bit of malt in the background too. The finish is dry and lightly bitter. Pretty average but a nice find at the airport.
Saint-Omer Brune du Brasseur;Saint Omer, France;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Saint-Omer;Brown flip-top 65cl bottle, part of a mixed four pack. Best before May 2008, drank May 2007. Poured into a small ’Palm’ bulbous glass (four times), it looks dark, very dark brown, with a good off-white head. The head obviously shrinks away, but it does stay for a while and clings to the glass right to the end of the drink. Aroma of burnt malts and vanilla, even some bannana esters, but nothing very strong. Dark malts and a hint of toffee in the taste, again like the aroma, nothing too strong. The mouthfeel is neither thin nor weak, but it has no body either. drinkable, but not exciting enough for me.

Saint-Omer Brune du Brasseur;Saint Omer, France;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Saint-Omer;Bottle, 6.4%. Clear very dark brown colour. Small light brown head. The flavour is quite mild. Subtle roasted note. Hint of dark bread in the finish. Good mouthfeel.
Saint-Omer Brune du Brasseur;Saint Omer, France;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Saint-Omer;Bottled, 650ml Swing top. Dark brown, almost black with cream head. Initially fairly lactic, acidic, but it calmed down into a smoother, more fruity beer with medium body and fairly sweet. The fruit is blackberry with touches of toffee cream, then a tinny note. It’s ok, but 650ml was a bit too much.
Saint-Omer Brune du Brasseur;Saint Omer, France;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Saint-Omer;Nose of metal, some dark fruit waxiness, nuts, maybe cherry. Sweet bready malts, blood, metal, vague nuttiness. Dark brown and thinly headed. Leaves a watery impression on the palate. Not unpleasant but makes me thirst after something not quite so dead...
Saint-Omer Brune du Brasseur;Saint Omer, France;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Saint-Omer;Deep garnet colour, impressively thick, tight off white head. A mix of malt, coffee & spice on the nose...fairly complex. The palate is lighter than I expected for a 6.4% brew, but has a bit of malt & spice again. It’s ok but not the big robust nightcap style I was hoping for. Part of a mixed 4 pack of St Omer beers from Aldi.
Saint-Omer Brune du Brasseur;Saint Omer, France;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Saint-Omer;Bottle. Pitch balck beer with a fairly robust light brown head. The aroma is like a milk stout and the flavour is quite watery, milky and sugary. Overall a disappointing beer after a good start.
Saint-Omer Brune du Brasseur;Saint Omer, France;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Saint-Omer;Dark brown and quite malty.Poured with a big head and had plenty of body. Interesting and not quite what I expected.
Saint-Omer Brune du Brasseur;Saint Omer, France;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Saint-Omer;Bottle, from High Spirits in Cleethorpes. Deep chestnut brown, almost black. Good long lasting creamy off white head and gentle condition. Low toffee sweet aroma to start with, then a developing fruitiness that becomes slightly tart and woody. Some muted roasted barley notes in the mouth, with a faint nuttiness. A slight earthy chalkiness develops with time giving a little bitterness tha is balanced out by a light butterscotch sweetness. Short and chalky finish with some delicate roastiness.
Saint-Omer Brune du Brasseur;Saint Omer, France;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Saint-Omer;75cl bottle, Auchan. Very dark brown with thick beige head. Not a lot of aroma. some dark malt. Bit bland in mouth, some malt on end. Just not a lot of flavour
Mickey Finns BBQ Bock;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;A sweet beer. Despite the BBQ reference, this is a sweetbock beer. While not bad it takes some getting used too. Smoke not really noticable. Overall a decent beer.
Mickey Finns BBQ Bock;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;On tap at Mickey Finn’s brewpub, Libertyville, IL. Clear amber hued rauch-boch having average white head with good lacing. Soft aroma with nutty, citrusy smokey hints. No discernable carbonation. Medium-to-bull bodied that starts with a smooth light sweet roasted malt flavor with moderate bitterness and finishes dry with moderate bitterness. A delicious smoked beer.
Town Hall Imperial Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tap on 10/28/2005 (rating from notes). Black color with a brown head. Deep dark fruity aroma, rich chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and slighly roasted coffee flavors.
Town Hall Imperial Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;This was a litle more complex than the Czar Jack as the flavors sood out more.The only problem is that it seemed a little thinner on the palate.Nice sense of espresso, molasses and chocolate.
Town Hall Imperial Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tar/pitch appearance with some brown and a dark cream head. Notes of vanilla, milk, light chocolate, roasted malts, Fritos-brand corn chips, and Double Spearmint gum. A grape note is very subdued. The flavor has more smoke than the aroma and I could feel the alcohol up my nose. A deep bitterness rounds out the finish. It is of moderate thickness, being acceptable but not exceptional for mouthfeel. (on tap at brewpub)
Town Hall Imperial Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Enjoyed during TH’s anniversary celebration. I was told this is the 2004, non bourbon barrell aged Czar Jack. I believe this is the version I had at the 2004 Great Taste of the Midwest, from which I was the 1st Ratebeerian to rate the original Czar Jack. To my knowledge to effort was made on TH’s part to distinguish the subsequent barrel aged Czar Jack from the original and therefore, my original rating, I have just come to find out, is technically based upon a different brew. Therefore, I am unsure as to whether this version warrants a separate beer entry. For now I will rate it, and we’ll see what we can do about perhaps making this the Czar Jack and making the the other the Bourbon Barrel Aged Czar Jack. Not as heavy an aroma as the last outstanding Imp. Stout I had, Bell’s Batch 7000. This is more fruity and has defininite chalk notes. Opaque body and tan head. Outstanding lace. Definitely more elegant and refined than Batch 7000. This is a wonderful brew; so wonderful, I ordered a second one."
Town Hall Imperial Stout;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Town Hall 8th Anniversary, Thursday surprise release: Imagine my joy upon seeing this listed under the Seasonals section! Woo hoo! Color is black as death with no head. The aroma was pretty hard to pin down. It had some vanilla or coffee hints, but a small trail of that Windex quality and not in a terrible way. Dry and slightly bitter taste up front. Predominantly chocolate with a pinch of coffee. The alcohol is completely hidden. This is a pretty damn fine treat before it hits the barrels!
Marzoni's ESB;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;On draught at Marzoni’s. Nice grapefruity aroma, light and fruity, with heavy resin and pine. Hop oils and dead sugary malt. Subtley a knockout. Hazy medium-dark amber with thin foamy lacing off-white head. Medium watery body and light-medium carbonation. Starts dry and heavily bitter with huge hop notes. Mild sweet maltiness, light grains, but this bitter is big on hops. Oily resinous finish with lingering sugary malt. Big bitter after that curls the tongue. Good stuff. I think for the style it was a bit hoppy, but maybe if this were hand pumped to kill the carbonation, the bitterness would not be as prominent.
Mickey Finns Butler Ballpark Ale;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;On tap at the Mickey Finn Brew Pub. Poured a medium and cloudy brown color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of toasted malts, chocolate, and light caramel. Tastes of lighter chocolate, caramel, toasted malts, and I swear I was getting some citrus in there too.
Mickey Finns Butler Ballpark Ale;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;3.1 15 (04.14.06) On tap at Mickey Finn’s, Libertyville, IL. Poured opaque dark brown with large off-white head. No discernable carbonation. Sweet malt and licorice in the nose. Medium bodied that starts with light malt sweetness and coffee/chocolate flavor. Finished dry with light malt fade. No discernable hop presence. A good drinkable malty English-style brown ale. Mickey Finn’s beer board referred to the ballpark ale as a brown ale. The bartender also confirmed that this beer is a brown ale.
Mickey Finns Butler Ballpark Ale;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Presumably whoever entered this brew had something to do with it, since he/she didn’t rate it. Which leaves me puzzled as to why it’s listed as a brown ale, since the description refers to it as a mild. The bartender at the brewpub didn’t know either way. It is a decent mild, pouring a deep brown with a tan head that laces nicely. The aroma is toasty malts and chocolate. Nice and smooth. It tastes of lightly roasted malt with the chocolate becoming more pronounced. And as with a good mild ale, the earthy hops are barely present. Nice mild, but a mediocre brown. Mickey Finn’s Brewery, Libertyville, IL

La Jolla Brewhouse Blue Whale Pale Ale;La Jolla, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;La Jolla Brewhouse;See my notes about the brewpub under my rating for La Jolla Brewery California Blonde. 6 oz. sampler at the brewpub. Like the other LJB beers, this is an attractive one in the glass - golden bronze color, clear with a a creamy white head that lasts well and leaves nice lace. Aroma is faint and dominated by floral hops with notes of grass and light citrus. Flavor is also dominated by the floral hops - this one is unbalanced in my opinion, with little maltiness - it tastes much like it smells. Light body, moderate carbonation. Disappointing overall for one of my favorite styles.
La Jolla Brewhouse Rip Tide Red;La Jolla, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;La Jolla Brewhouse;Dark reddish brown appearance. Roasted malt, caramel toffee aroma with light fruity citrus. Strong hoppy palate, plenty of bitterness. Nutty roasted malt, but bitterness dominates.
La Jolla Brewhouse Rip Tide Red;La Jolla, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;La Jolla Brewhouse;6 oz. sampler on draft at brewpub. This one poured a nice, deep reddish mahogany color with a creamy beige head that left good lace. Aroma is mild - something that most of these LJB beer seem to have in common - what aroma there is seems to be dominated by earhty notes, some toasty maltiness along with floral hops. The flavor is sweet and toasty with carmelly malts, a little fruit and nicely balanced by floral and citrus hops with a little earthiness in the finish. Medium body and smooth gentle carbonation. This is one of the better of the LJB beers.

Riegele Speziator Dunkel;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Brauhaus Riegele;Like all Riegele beers,also this one has a new label. The bolltle states 7.5% alcohol. There should be an expiry date on the bottle but I can not find. The beer is a liitle sweet and has some fig, raisin and chocloate taste. The beer also tastes a little sicy and last quite long. A little bit like a bock and a little bit like a Belgian dubbel.

Turbo Super Strong Beer;Gurgaon, Haryana, India;Malt Liquor;Millennium Beer Industries (United Breweries);"Bottled. Bright golden, small brief head. Aroma of glue and rice. Sweet with plenty of varous solubles, but glue dominates unitl rice takes over and alcohol shines through. There’s a vague hint of syrup as well. Not a terribly pleasant experience. Thhe probably forgot some words in the commercial decription, they must have meant ""Brewed far away from imported (or any) hops""."
Samuel Adams Imperial Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Boston Beer Company;"From Sep 2007 This pours from 12oz bottlebest before January 2008) a cloudy orange with a small but firm head of foam and it has some lacing. The smell is of citrus hops, grapefruit, and I'm also getting a bit of pine. The taste is very hoppy! I'm getting the citrus, grapefruit & orange, but I also can taste some floral and some spicy flavours. In the background, I can just taste some caramel malt but it's on the light side...man, the finish is *very* bitter but *very* tasty. The mouthfeel is medium, the carbo is medium light, and boy, for it being 8.8%abv, it's hidden pretty well. Also, the aftertaste lingers on like forever. A good feature if you like what's going on in this brew, a bad feature if it's not one that you favour all that much. Bottom line: A fine tasting Imperial Pilsner; If I were to make any suggestions about it, I'd say I'd like to see a bit more of a malt profile to give it more balance. Still, it's a winner."
Samuel Adams Imperial Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Boston Beer Company;Aroma and flavor is spicy hops, citrus and a mix of mild malt sweetness and bitter in the finish.
Samuel Adams Imperial Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Boston Beer Company;This beer makes me wnat to thrust my hand into fire as I drink it. At first you are getting hops with a hint of wool and the aroma remindes me of the time I wrestled a bull and it messed itself over me. The after taste is slightly wood and earwig with a fine hint of fuel. I’m liking it a lot and will probably bathe in several gallons of this fine brew this evening.
Samuel Adams Imperial Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Boston Beer Company;Rating this as i drink my second, it looks and smells like a IPA or IIPA. An almost burnt orange body with average carbonation and a yellowish tinged head that leaves plenty of good lace. Aroma has floral and some citrus notes, flavor is dominated by the hop tartness, with a dry finish. I am not normally a big fan of pilsners and this was my first Imp. pilsner, but i liked this stuff. Originally rated on 11/24/08.
Samuel Adams Imperial Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Boston Beer Company;Pours a deep golden yellow. Nice aromas of hops/citrus/peppery. Nice hoppy flavor, spicy/pepper, alcohol shows up in the back end. And once again I love the bottle.

Samuel Adams Imperial Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Boston Beer Company;Light copper color with minimal off-white head. Spicy hop aroma. Fairly thick, rich mouthfeel with more earthy, spicy hops on the palate. Potent hop bitterness.
Samuel Adams Imperial Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Boston Beer Company;The body has a deep orange amber color with a few random and tiny bubbles of carbonation here and there. Its clarity is very good as well. The head is very thick and creamy with about a two and a half finger thick ness. It is light tan in color and very long lasting which makes for nice sticky rings of lacing on the glass. The aroma is really rich and full of leafy/spicy hops and pale bready malt. The flavor, like its aroma, has an intense spicy/leafy/herbal hop character. It is in you face with hops and bitterness. Under this heavy layer of hops is a simple and very modest pale bready malt flavor. There is just enough malt presence in there to remind you that this is a beer and not just a bottle of hop extract. It finishes with slowly with a strong hop flavor and bitterness that clings to tongue and feels like it is pulling the enamel off of your teeth. The palate has a full, thick body and slick texture with light carbonation.
Samuel Adams Imperial Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Boston Beer Company;"Two finger head with good lasting power and nice lace on the glass edge. Very cloudy with a darker gold color Hoppy aroma as expected, but more muted than the ""intense"" monicker might indicate. Creamy body with an equally high carbonation. Very bitter flavor; could even be an extreme IPA if weren’t lagered. The hop is fresh and long lasting, well after the swallow. This would not be a regular drinking pilsner, but it is special and extreme in its flavoring. You will never get bored of it."
Samuel Adams Imperial Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Boston Beer Company;This was easily one of the most assertive beers I’d had from Sam Adams. The first time I had it, when it was called the Hallertau pilsner, I could barely stomach it. As my taste developed, so did my appreciation.
Samuel Adams Bohemian Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Boston Beer Company;Draft at the Sam Adams Cincinnati Taproom. Pours a bright, just barely cloudy yellow-gold with a finger of white head that settles into a ring and partial film. Notes of pale and crackery pils malts, very light pepper, grass, florals, and herbs. Light-bodied, with moderate to medium carbonation and a clean, crisp mouthfeel. Nice. My favorite of the evening.
Samuel Adams Bohemian Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Boston Beer Company;Pours a clear gold color. Brilliantly clear, it looks amazing. Good initial head, about two fingers. Reduces to half finger and is holding well. Splotchy lacing. The notable thing about the aroma, and it’s not necessarily bad, is it smells like Miller Lite. That’s the Saaz hops. Except this is much hoppier than Miller. Cracker. Touch of toffee. Spicy (again saaz hops). Taste is hop leaning. A little cracker malty stuff to even it out. A little spicy, a bit of lemon. Or is it lemongrass, or both? Mouthfeel is medium light. Spicy bitter hop front, but finishes clean and dry. Overall, it’s good. I like it. It’s your standard pils. It would be an excellent example to introduce someone to a pils, especially with the familiar aroma and mainstream brand name. Yeah, I’d recommend it and I would buy it again.
Samuel Adams Bohemian Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Boston Beer Company;Clear gold, tall white head. Honeyed, herbal nose.

Samuel Adams Bohemian Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Boston Beer Company;I actually still have one or 2 of these a rep left at my place of work. Anyways, pours a deep golden yellow hue. Bubbly white head. Grainy nose, faintly perfumey/floral, herbal hops. Pale biscuity malts, grainy, simple. Light in body, sticky resinous hops throughout a crisp clean finish. Nothing too wonderful here, yet a nice rendition. I remember drinking the golden pilsner as a kid and enjoying it quite a bit. Obviously my palate has changed a bit in the last few years, but hey I still have some bottles of that left over I found stashed in a closet at my parents house. Anybody want some Sam Adams Golden Pilsner from several years ago? Mmmmm.

Light golden-orange colour. Grassy herbal hops and honey on the nose. Flavour is very well balanced with sweet malt & fresh hop notes. A decent stab at the style, comperable to a good Euro pils. Too bad it lost.
Samuel Adams Bohemian Pilsner;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Boston Beer Company;Sample A bottle shared with Jerc and GregClow. Really interesting aroma - peppery hops, sweet, light malt, almost a wheat/yeast thing going on - pretty nice. Yellow, nice sized white head, but goes away pretty quickly. Watery mouthfeel. Decent pils hops in taste, but the rest of all watered down. Short watery finish. Good start, bad finish.

Samuel Adams Brown Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Boston Beer Company;From Oct 2007 This pours from 12oz bottle a dark brown with a large head of off white foam that recedes slowly and it has good lacing. The smell has some roasted malt, some fruit, sweet malt, and a bit of chocolate. The taste has a good malty flavour..I get some roasted and caramel, a touch of chocolate, and there's some hop citrus in the background. Very easy drinking. The mouthfeel is medium, the carbo is medium light, and it finishes with a dark chocolate semi sweetness. This is a pretty good example of a Brown Ale and I'd buy it again.
Samuel Adams Brown Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Boston Beer Company;Poured into a nonic pint glass, the appearance was a semi-hazy dark burnt orange color almost brown color. Quickly dissipating finger’s worth of white foamy to bubbly head. Barely any lace. The aroma spits out some sweet nuttiness, roasty notes, and toast. The flavor leans sweet through the previously mentioned aromas. More toast than nuts in the taste. Long sweet sticky nutty aftertaste. No finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation. Some cloying qualities. Overall, as an English brown ale I can see it, but since it’s fairly cloying in the feel, well, I would rather have other brown ales before this.
Samuel Adams Brown Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Boston Beer Company;"""another brown that isn’t bad, but does absolutely nothing to seperate itself.

Small white mostly diminishing head, fine sized bubbles, poor lacing, hazy, carbonated, and a straw yellow hue. Sweet, banana, spicy and clove aroma typical for this style.

Three Floyds Caligulan Imperial Cream Ale;Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;This didn’t do it for me. The amber body with weak white head released aromas of hops, clover honey, yeast, Illini sweet, and fresh cream. Creamy in the mouth but the aromas didn’t translate into flavor. It was a bit too bitter for a cream ale.

Nice work FFF!
Three Floyds Caligulan Imperial Cream Ale;Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;"2005 growler shared with OldGrowth on 1/1/2006. Acquired in a great trade with the generous RoofTopRogue. Head recedes to nothing over a matter of about two or three minutes, though initially it pours large and beige colored. Shining, burnished brass/straw body is clear. No lacing, yet there is a light film left on the glass. Initial aroma smells strongly of coconut shavings, malibu rum, very light isopropyl-like alcohols, and something more that I can’t put my finger on. I come to the conclusion of ""fancy bath soaps"" and OldGrowth immediately suggests, ""French milled soap"". Yes! That’s it. An undeniable likeness to french milled bar soap. And, surprisingly (to me anyways) not in a bad way at all. The coconut eventually fades and the yeast that seems to be producing it becomes more clear as the beer warms, though it is still lightly sourish and fruity-dry. Alcohol notes in the nose never strengthen, and probably recede as the beer warms, making it of little concern overall. The flavor begins with coconut to the max, very yeasty and a dry, bitter, leafy hoppiness. Citric, dry, light pine. As it warms, it takes on a very round and fruity flavor, soft, with very dry pale maltiness, though hardly even honeyish in nature. Very much like dried out white bread dough, though the light touches of caramel add the needed sweetness. When cold, it has an almost creamy, lemon-vanilla cake icing appeal, that seems to fade as it warms. Low carbonation, but not thin or watery at all. The bubbles are small and minimally expansive, engaging, moderately, the palate. But it proves to be a very slippery texture overall, gliding down seemlessly, with only a bite on the end from the yeast, mixed with a light kick of alcohol. Actually very well-to-style, if you extrapolate what a double cream ale would be. It’s enjoyable to find a beer that actually benefits from drinking at colder temperatures."
Three Floyds Caligulan Imperial Cream Ale;Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Growler, provided by ClarkVV. I’ll start by saying I’m not usually a cream ale drinker. Good nose, Spicy. Coconut (like Malibu), cinnamon, minor tangerine and french milled soap. Cooper oarnage color, nice head that faded quickly, no lacing. Spiced flavors, like aroma. The coconut and tangerine really stand out to me. Medium body, lite creamy mothfeel, sweet finish. Had a flavor I associate with some of 3Floyds brews. It’s intersting, but not something I’d have alot of, even if we did drink half the growler. Thanks Clark for this rare treat.

BJ's Detour Dunkelweizen;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Mild weizen aroma, but this beer had A LOT of flavor. The taste was brimming with banana and clove. Actually, I have to admit that the flavor was a bit excessive in that regard. Quite sweet (too sweet) as well. I was happy to find a flavorful brew, but this was just too much.

Rohrbach Pumpkin Spice Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Rohrbach Pumpkin Spice Ale is a hazy amber ale with a dense, light beige head that has great retention and lacing. Pumpkin and nutmeg are very prominent in the aroma, which is slightly sweet. It has a smooth, medium body with a slightly gritty finish. It has a very strong pumpkin flavor! It’s squashy and very spicy. It’s slightly bitter and well balanced. It’s all about the pumpkin and spice-- appropriately named.
Rohrbach Pumpkin Spice Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Draft at the Railroad St. Brewery. Pours orange with a beige head. Pumpkin pie aroma with nutmeg and cinnamon. The flavor is much the same as the aroma.

Rohrbach Pumpkin Spice Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Rohrbach Brewing Company;(draft @ Rohrbach’s - Ogden, NY) Hazy copper color with a fizzy tan head. Aroma has lots of cinammon, pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, and even some clove I think. Taste is heavily laden with nutmeg and cinammon with a smooth and pumpkiny flavor in the middle and a smooth and sweet finish. Really decent pumpkin ale.

Rohrbach Pumpkin Spice Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Rohrbach Brewing Company;Had this on draft at the establishment. Regular looking yellow color with white foamy head. Aroma of nutmeg. Palate of cinammon and pumpkin. Finish of pumpkin and slight hops that made it feel like the pumpkin had some body. Like pumpkin pie this was different than the spicier one I had a week earlier. Very enjoyable, I have never seen this selection before.
Fort Street Devils Ale;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Stout;Fort Street Brewery;Cask: dark brown, flat and oily, no head whatsoever. Aroma rather muted, coffee hints of chocolate, can’t pick up any vinous or woody notes. Flavor much the same, with some wood in the finish. Can’t all be coffee fans.
Fort Street Devils Ale;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Stout;Fort Street Brewery;Bottle: This is a port barrel cask aged version of the Third Shift Breakfast Stout. Aroma is very mild. Roasted coffee with hints of chocolate. Dark brown, with no transparency and no head. Flavor is roasted coffee with light fruitiness. The strenth of the vanilla flavor in the regular seens to be muted by the woodiness in the finish. Vanilla is there, but not as strong. A mellower version of the regular with a bitter woody finish. Almost no carbonation in the mouthfeel. I prefer the regular.
Fort Street Mild Ale;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Fort Street Brewery;Ed-Brown reddish edges, decent off white head. Toast/cereal up front, light crystal like sweetness, really clean malt bill. Flavor much the same. Clean, cracker, toast, light caramel/crystal, light hopping, just enough to cleanse palate. Big viscous mouthfeel. Very easy drink. Well done.
Fort Street Mild Ale;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Fort Street Brewery;On tap: Moderately fruity aroma with light toffee.

Lunar Red Planet;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lunar Brewing Company;This year’s ICBG ReplicAle entry, spiced with Cascade hops. On tap at the brewpub and shaker served, displaying a fairly clear, amber color, with a presentable layer of off white head foam that gradually diminished to a small, but persistent ring & film, and left some clingy spots & streaks of lacing on the glass. The aroma began with a bit of doughy yeast that faded quickly to expose some moderate toastiness, just a touch of esters, and a hint of light caramel scent & sweetness. Light to medium bodied, with a good level of carbonation, the taste added a moderate, earthy hop bitterness that possessed a subtle lingering quality, coupled with a touch of citrusy astringency, and a bit of malty creaminess to the mouthfeel. A decently drinkable American Amber, and one of the better entries at the 7th Annual Oak Park Micro Brew & Food Review for the guild project.
Lunar Red Planet;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lunar Brewing Company;"One of the few Lunar brews to be nearly headless, this is a cloudy brown ""amber"" ale. (I confirmed it as such. It seems like frankenkitty got the only staff member who doesn’t know anything about beer.) A nutty, sweet malt drink with a slightly sour finish, this is one of the tamest ales that I’ve had at the brewpub. Lunar Brewing Company, Villa Park, IL"
Lunar Red Planet;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lunar Brewing Company;"Amber/orange, lightly hazed with barely anything resembling a film or head on top. Aroma was bitter hops and floral with cigarette smoke (wait... no, scratch that), light basement & banana (of all things). Flavor was nutty with considerable sweetness, dependent on malts with yeasts being a strong secondary characteristic. Lemony sour and lightly spiced to finish. When I called Lunar to ask about how they classified this, all they could tell me was, ""It’s an Ale."" It is a slightly thin beer, definitely sessionable. It struck me as having Belgian qualities with it’s yeasty presence and hidden yet detectable alcohol. Let’s call it a ""Belgian Red."" On tap at Lunar Brewing Company, Villa Park, IL"
Barley's Wheat Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;Barley's Brewing Company;Draft sampler at Barleys Smokehouse (Ale House #2).

Delaneys Hefeweizen;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;New England Brewing Co.;I think this is what I had at the brewery last night a tasting. A thin and spotting head on the pour from the tap with a darker yellow body. It starts off pretty plan but flavor starts to come out as it warms and as you go down the glass. A good beer but not great.
Delaneys Hefeweizen;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;New England Brewing Co.;When I was at Delaneys last weekend, I noticed they had a beer on draught called Delaneys Hefeweizen. When I asked who brewed it for them, I was told New England Brewing did. The pour is cloudy with a thin white head. Smells of lemon, banana and oranges. Taste is the same. Overall a very boring interpretation of the style.
Tun Tavern Tunfest Lager;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Tun Tavern;on tap-pours a white head that laces. Color is clear gold with lots of effervescence. Aroma is grain. Taste is grain, sweet (familiar) and has good carbonation.
Uncle Tuckers Smoked Porter;Cumberland, Maryland, United States;Porter - Smoked;Uncle Tuckers Brewhouse;Draft... Pitch black with a mid-sized, frothy, tan head. The nose is of caramel, cocoa and light hickory smoke. Flavor matches the aroma... rich, roasted malts and bitter hops. Medium-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Finishes oily, bitter and burnt.
Uncle Tuckers Cherry Wheat;Cumberland, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Uncle Tuckers Brewhouse;Draft... Murky, golden ale with a tiny, fizzy, white head.

Uncle Tuckers Blonde Bombshell;Cumberland, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Uncle Tuckers Brewhouse;"Draft... Clear, deep copper ale with a small, creamy, off-white head. Good retention. Vineous aroma with notes of port, ripe apple and pear. Sweet, malty flavor. Nicely hopped, but the bitterness is smacked around by honey sweetness. Boozy, but not overwhelming. Golden raisins and pink grapefruit. Full-bodied and oily with medium carbonation. A really nice ""sipper."" Warm, cozy brew on a cold, late Fall evening."
Turtle Mountain Killer Bs Bock;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Pours a deep brown with a tan little head.

Finishes slightly bitter.
Lunar Honeymoon Red;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lunar Brewing Company;Reddish brown in color with a creamy tan head and heavy lacing, this has a sweet caramel malt aroma sweet with honey and a touch of resinous hops. The sweetness wins out in the flavor, malt & honey, with a bit of hop bitterness emerging in the finish. I confirmed with the brewer that this was an amber. Judging by the differences in head, though, it seems like frankenkitty and I had two different drinks. Lunar Brewing Company, Villa Park, IL
Lunar Honeymoon Red;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lunar Brewing Company;"Caramel colored with orange highlights (Dark copper, I’d suppose) with a small head that fades fast. It was hazed without cloudiness... it was more of a sugary thickness. Aroams were varied, overall dank with caramel, a touch of pine, lemon and notes of cooked vegetables as I pressed on. Mostly sour, though. Flavor was dirty malts, light honey sweetness and a sprucey, almost minty finish. When I called Lunar to ask about how they classified this, all they could tell me was, ""Well... it’s kinda like an Oktoberfest."" Hmmm... it doesn’t resemble a Marzen, nor the beer that Cornfield listed as their Oktoberfest. For the time being I’m entering it as an Amber, although it reminds me alot of their Bitter. Hopefully I can speak to an actual brewer in the future (or maybe one of my fellow raters can get the skinny on it so I could change it accordingly). Via growler, one day old from Lunar Brewing Company, Villa Park, IL"

Brandon Napper Tandy;Brandon, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brandon Brewery;Cask - Kings Head, Norwich. Bubbly though relatively thick and creamy, lasting off-white head, leaving a uniform lace atop a clear amber-mid brown body. Tangy red fruits, some nuttiness and yeast aromas. Almond on the tongue, yeast with a lightly sharp tangy and a light fruit skin and dryish English hop bitterness. Softish palate, light to medium body with a lingering tangy, fruit skin finish. Maybe not in the best condition, which is surprsing for the KH.

Nethergate Jolly Roger;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;Cask handpull at Wenlock Arms. Chestnut beer with thick lasting off white head. Nich rich malts, some choc and toffee and good green hop aroma. Finish has more slightly acidic hop to blance the rich malts, but it doesn’t quite pull it off. Finish is too astringent on the back of the choc malts. You are expecting a warming dark malty bitter and then are hit with this hop astringency. Needs refinement
Clarks Henry Boons Hammerhead;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);Cask Handpump at the Crescent, Salford 18/10/2006 Fruit aroma. Bronze coloured slightly rich on the palate and fruity. A little sweetness in the malt finish.

I would say its my type of bitter because the hops stand out more than the malt. Aroma was of citrus hops and malt. translucent and copper look with normal white cask head. Flavor was crisp with citrus with malt as a nice compliment. Really nice and fruity bitter. medium palate. Really nice bitter
Clarks Henry Boons Hammerhead;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);Cask@The Market Porter, Borough, London.

Robinsons Lighthouse;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Robinsons Family Brewery;Cask handpull at Market Porter. Deep gold colour with no head. Toffee apple aroma with green apple acid in mouth which continues onto the end. Some hop. I find that some beers I have at the Market Porter are disappointing and this is another in that class. Is the turnover of beer too high and this sacrifices the quality?

Leinenkugels Apple Spice;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Reviewed from notes. Poured into a pint glass. The color is a moderate orangish color with a thin off white head. The nose is really just a combination of apple juice and a bit of a cinnamon. Both the nose and taste are quite a bit like Apple Jacks, but not in a good way. Feel is moderate and a bit gross. Cloying for sure. Drinkability is not good. I don’t like this and I don’t want more.

Leinenkugels Apple Spice;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);This is another unique brew by the Leinenkugel family. I was a little bit impressed on how they could make an apple flavored beer. I got this from a friend and was quite shocked on how different, but tasty it was. I enjoyed it during a nice autumn evening. Poured into a pint glass. Color is a straw amber. It pours a near white head that doesn’t last too long. It definitely tasted like apple cider and beer combined. Mouthfeel is very crisp. Overall, I don’t know how they did it, but this one is worth a try! However, I probably could only have a few of these. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 08-12-2008 06:46:22

Very strong apple spice aroma. Taste was very sweet, but also very authentic. Didn’t taste artificially flavored and it had a good cinnamon bite to it that made you pucker a bit. Basically tasted like sweet apple cider with a kick. Hard to call this beer and too sweet to drink more than one, but again, tasty treat in December. I hope they bring it back periodically.

Leinenkugels Apple Spice;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Hmmm....intriguing. I like the aroma....reminds me of the inside of an apple orchard, with the fresh apples and cinnamon from the doughnuts. Flavor is overly sweet, with an almost candy-like flavor from the apples.

Victory Harvest Pils;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Draft. Retired, my ass. Is on at Kennet Sq now. Not a lot of aroma. Dense, persistent lace, at least for the style. The beer tastes of all the best sticky, sweet, slightly dank hops, only to give way to cracker, then gone. As good a pils as I’ve ever had.

Victory Harvest Pils;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);I bet this beer really pisses off the Germans. Especially if you drink it out of Das Boot. Great beer for the style.
Victory Harvest Pils;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);i don’t think any American brewery makes better Pilsener than Victory does. This is above and beyond due to the extraordinary use of fresh hops stuff. does good things to good German beers.

Lasting pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. Light in body, refreshing, and easy to drink. Complex and well balanced. A tasty brew. I would certainly have this again.

Old Milwaukee Black;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Originally rated March 2006. Good creamy white head comes out of the can, with a golden colour. Retention is actually quite good and lacing left as well. Carbonation on the other hand is not happening. Very, very flat. The nose started off nicely with some sweet malt, but ended with a strong alcohol scent. The taste is pretty smooth, with some real sweetness and light bitterness. Not a really bad malt liquor, but still not great... and no where near Mongoose.
Old Milwaukee Black;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Can. Pale yellow in colour, white head, some lace. Very sweet aroma, lots of alcohol. The flavour was again very sweet, tonnes of corn syrup. Alcoholic mouthfeel, light body, light carbonation. Finishes horribly sweet and grainy.
Old Milwaukee Black;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Malt, corn aroma, yellow, tiny white head. Harsh malt taste, wickedly sweet and grainy. Very poor.
Old Milwaukee Black;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;can. ugh! 9%? pale golden with a white ring of head. aroma is sweet peaches and cream and water. very sweet adjunct hell. this is watery and not particularly pleasing.
Old Milwaukee Black;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;"This was truly rotten. The can was old, yes, but this was shit. Nasty fusel aroma, overly sweet, harsh alcoholic palate. Palest of straw color, little to no white head. Doug Shoemaker chugging this stuff from the can was priceless. ""I’d dump this down the drain but I’m afraid the drain will reject it"""
Old Milwaukee Black;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Vintage around 2-3 years. Strong fruity aroma, hint of cherry, alcohol, plenty of sweet malt. Fizzy white head on top. Chewy malts, sweet, medium bodied. Strong lager, alcohol is present but less than you would expect from such beer. Alcohol is not as dry and harsh as some malt liqueurs do. For what it is quiet drinkable. Best choice for paper bag brew. I am guessing age smoothen this liqueur be more civilized.
Santa Barbara Punkn Saison;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Poursa hazy orange hue with a quick fading head. Aromas of pumpkin, spice, a little apple cider. Light bodied with a great pumkin and chai like spices. Smooth vanilla finish.

Town Hall Barrel Aged Wee Heavy;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"From Notes. Growler to stein. Polished off in a sitting with a good friend. A very tasty brew. Aroma is nice malt, with the honey from the BA more assertive than I would have thought. Flavor is much the same...only better. Great mouthfeel, very creamy. Don’t get a ton of ""wood"" character here, which is my only complaint. But an awesome, awesome beer."
Town Hall Barrel Aged Wee Heavy;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours a dark brown with a slight red tinge. Nice 1 finger bead. Malty, Biscuity, sweet aroma with a touch of vanilla and alcohol. Medium mouthfeel. Peaty, smokey, sweet dark fruit and honey flavors abound in the taste. Pretty sweet but in a good way. Apples flavors as well. Scottish/Irish whiskey notes. Sweet honey with smokey finish.
Town Hall Barrel Aged Wee Heavy;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;growler thanks to pantanap! Lovely lightly murky glowing brown red with a small fizzy head. Great scotch yeast aroma, lightly fruity, touch of glue? (not sure that’s what I wrote), phenol, touch of smoke. Sweet fruity first taste but quickly turns to a nice beechwood like jerky smokiness, odd, weird play of sweet and smoke. Medium bodied, syrupy with light carbonation.
Town Hall Barrel Aged Wee Heavy;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Growler shared by theisti, thanks Tim. Color is dark brown with a small head. Aroma is strong with a stingy alcohol. Some stickiness from the malts and alcohol and a cherry-alcohol aspect all over. The grain alcohol aspect dies down as the beer warms and w wet leaf earthiness emerges. A bit thinner than I like my Scotch Ales.
Town Hall Barrel Aged Wee Heavy;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Sampled at RBWG 2010. Awesome bourbon barrel character here. Sweet, a hint of smoked malts. Good stuff!

Town Hall Barrel Aged Wee Heavy;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Definite interesting honey/mead note on the nose. Interesting dust and almost a belgian yeast type sweetness. Notes of some alcohol and also caramel sweetness. Dark brown with amber pours not to much in the way of head or lace. Honey flavors - mead like sweet/tartness, caramel, toffe, dust, and some vodka heat. Interesting, but not really scotchy in any way to me except very late in the finish. Lingering heat in mouth.
Town Hall Barrel Aged Wee Heavy;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;12oz hand bottle, thanks Tom. Pours a lighter root beer brown with little carbonation showing. Deffinetly pick up the mead in here. Sweet honey, touch of peat, plum, toffee. Leather, peat, plum, some honey, vodka, a twang to it.

Founders India Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;IPA;Founders Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Azacca? What the din din? No idea. Neither do the Aztec, nor I. For a beer I thought it was OK, if indifferent. So you could drink this pretentious little brew, but when you want to impress the beeyotches, stick with Blatz: that shit will make you itch. Or not.
Founders India Pale Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;IPA;Founders Restaurant & Brewing Co.;Clear golden body with a clingy, cottony white head. Aroma and flavor seem stale with notes of cardboard and plant stems. Semi-dry with some slick malts and medium-high bitterness. Seems like a faded IPA.

Town Hall Barrel Aged Grand Cru;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Growler… Clear, burnt orange ale with a small, creamy, off-white head. The nose is of caramel, raw oak and vanilla with just a trace of bourbon. Full-bodied with a buttery mouthfeel and tingly carbonation. Moderately sweet, caramelly flavor with a nudge of bourbon and a suggestion of oak. Finishes lightly sweet with a slow fade. I want more cowbell bourbon.
Town Hall Barrel Aged Grand Cru;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Little boozy aroma, strong candied sugar complimented with floral mead. mousey brown. thin bodied, quickly sweet into warm wood soaked honey blossom.
Town Hall Barrel Aged Grand Cru;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Definite honey on the nose, dusty yeast, spicy belgian sweetness, some mead-y notes as well as some oranges and sweet fruity notes also - as it warms the nose becomes very harmonious. Works well with base beer. Amber brown pour, white foamy ring around the edges. Lots of honey wine mead flavors up front and throughout with spicy sweet belgian yeast sweetness - banana, spice, light dusty notes candi sugars and sweet orange as well. Very balanced with only light tangy alcohol. Solid carbonation. Nice.
Town Hall Barrel Aged Grand Cru;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;12oz hand bottle, thanks Tom. Opened as a bit of a gusher. Sweet honey, musty earthy wheat, dates, caramel and a touch of oak. Dark honey golden with somewhat loose carbonation appearance. Sticky medium weight mouthfeel. Sweet toasted honey bread, light yeasty, honeysuckle, more faint floral. The mead barrel works much better with this base beer than the wee heavy I just had.

Pour is a barely bubbly rusty brown with almost no head. Aroma is clean caramel malt, wood, light toffee, and a touch of fruit. Flavor is also lightly woody with lots of caramel and toffee.

Town Hall Barrel Aged Grand Cru;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Townhall grand cru... Handbottle from Levi... Pours a semi-trasparent medium caramel brown with a non-existent head... Aroma of light coconut, vanilla, a little bit of booze, dark fruit and caramel/toffee malt... Flavors of dark fruit, caramel and subtle barrel-aged flavors which remain pretty subtle. Very soft carbonation. Body was somewhat thin to some degree. 8/3/7/3/14
Town Hall Cider;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Apple Cider;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours a light yellow gold with next to no head. Mildly effervescent. Faint aroma of granny smith apples. A fairly light bodied and dry cider, tasting similar to a Hard Core cider (I didn’t try the Strongbow to compare it to), and also similar to my quick and easy home made cider. Okay, so its a hard cider, but nothing really exceptional. A shot of Jameson’s would have been quite nice in it, however. I wasn’t inspired to try another glass, but was inspired to pick up some Eric Bordelet cider
Town Hall Cider;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Apple Cider;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pure crap, allow me to ellaborate. Aroma and taste were exactly the same. Both smelled like cheap white wine. Had that shoddy buttery white grape aroma found in cheap white wines, possibly boxed wine level bad. Very thin and no apple character as the brewery claims should exist.
Town Hall Cider;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Apple Cider;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Clean clear yellow pour, very bright, with no head. Light sour apple aroma. Bright sweet fruit, that continues to get more and more sour as I drink it. So sour, it’s dry. Clean, with a sticky sweet after palalte. Flavor is a clingy alcohol and sour apple tart.
Town Hall Cider;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Apple Cider;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Honey Gold Coloring with No Head. Dry Cider/Apple Aroma. Carries Into Taste. Overall a Decent Dry Cider and Good Initial Attempt by a Brewpub.
Town Hall Cider;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Apple Cider;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Looks match the pale yellow green of a Golden Delicious, or the peel of a pear, perfectly clear, with no head, outside of a slim ring that’s gone as quick as you can say, ""Johnny Appleseed"". Aroma is slight, but distinctly apple, nothing much to speak of. Crisp, appley bite right at the top, apple flavor continues, but nothing else is provided to play with the senses. Light bodied, dry, fruity finish, thin mouthfeel, but excellent drinkability...for a cider. I’m not much or a cider afficiando, but this one does the least of what is asked of it, and no more. Was supposed to be brewed to match the character of Strongbow, which is already on tap constantly here, so I’m not sure what the point is, except maybe for the brewer to check another style off his list? An intriquing addition to the anniversary celebration, but nothing I’ll miss when it goes..."
Town Hall Cider;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Apple Cider;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;fairly clear amber hughes no head. Smells of apple juice touches of pears very very sweet. Highly carbonated but pretty thin. Flavor is apple juice touch of pair and grain.. very sweet juicy .. this doesn’t seem to be a beer to me.
Town Hall Cider;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Apple Cider;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Golden yellow color. A little plastic in the aroma.... Mild, moderate sweetness, moderate carbonation, low tang, apple finish subverted by a slight paper edge. A first foray into the style but holding up the mass-market ciders as the model is a big mistake: even if you perfect it, it’s a poor cider. Go to some English festivals and have some real ciders on cask (whether dry or sweet) and you’ll have a model that can get you to the promised land. But, of course, commercial considerations are important, and two non-Ratebeer friends who were with me at the 8th anniversary party thought this was pretty tasty. (on tap at brewpub)
Town Hall Cider;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Apple Cider;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Dry aroma with some apple evident, but not nearly as appley as say, Woodchuck.No head and no lace, but I didn’t necessarily expect it. No visible carbonation. Thin mouthfeel. Took awhile to convert my taste buds to cider after a couple of TH’s brews. It did improve after several sips. Nevertheless, TH should stick to beer. Not a bad 1st attempt, however.
Town Hall Cider;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Apple Cider;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Not really similar to Strongbow at all. This cider has the appropriate, however light, apple aroma. It is light gold and still. Flavor is very light apples with a little sour bite. Unfortunately the palate is very poor; it seems literally watered down and very thin. The apple flavor is there, but it needs a little more body."
Town Hall Cider;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Apple Cider;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Town Hall 8th Anniversary, Saturday release: Gold color with no head. Aroma was incredibly faint. If I didn’t know it was a cider, I wouldn’t have guessed apple. Well... the taste was certainly apple, and bone dry to boot. Syrupy mouthfeel. Something almost a bit sour about this that did not sit right. A noble attempt at cider, but about average.

Fischer Bräu Osterbock;Wien, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Fischer Bräu;Tap at the brewpub. Clear golden beer with a nice foamy white head. Fruity and malty aroma with a moderated hop perfume, a bit of freaky almond. Malt based flavor with a fruity alcohol taste, the freaky almond comes again. Balanced, smooth carbonation brings a honeyish background for a hoppy aftertaste.
Fischer Bräu Osterbock;Wien, Austria;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Fischer Bräu;Poured golden yellow with a thick white foam. Refreshing aroma of honey, hops, and a slight taste of alcohol. Sweet taste, medium dense clear body with low carbonation. To be honest, this was my first osterbock beer ever, and I only had maybe four since. Out of those, this was the finest.

Pours a thin, white, quick dissipating head with an opaque body. The nose and flavour is of sour milk and coffee. Though it lasts body (its very thin) I think that it matches to the style quite well. It have it again. Good.
John Harvards Manchester Stump Jumper Stout;Manchester, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Manchester;Cask at Manchester, CT location. Mildly sweet, grainy, with a minute chocolate aroma. This aroma is challenging to discern and somewhat boring. Opaque dark brown/black with a yellow/tan head. Bittersweet, unsweetened chocolate notes in the start, which turns much more roasted in the middle. Somewhat dry with mild hops to finish. The oatmeal is not as assertive as I expected. A solid stout, though.

Wynkoop Drunkin Pumpkin;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;One of the better pumpkin brews I’ve tried this season. Very easy drinking, not too spicy. Wish someone would make the Michigan Brewing Company Screamin’ Pumpkin this year. That’s my fave.
Wynkoop Drunkin Pumpkin;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Crystal clear burnt copper with a thin off-white head. Nose was thick with pumpkin pie aromas of sweet pumpkin goo, creamy biscuit, nutmeg, and a bit of ginger. The flavor is a little lacking in body and complexity but I like how it’s not over spiced. Nice clean caramel/earthy pumpkin backbone with some pumpkin-pie-spices, and a lingering nutmeg/ginger finish.

Wynkoop Drunkin Pumpkin;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Tap at Freshcraft - hazy dark copper beer - fairly clean and refreshing for a pumpkin ale - moderate malt profile with a wee bit of tanginess - strong spice profile, but nothing overpowering or overdone - quite a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon spiciness - the pumpkin itself comes through a bit in the finish - understated, which is nice in this style.
Wynkoop Drunkin Pumpkin;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Tasted on tap at Wynkoop Brewery in Denver, Colorado. Color similar to an Amber Ale. Light and highly spiced. I’m think it’s nutmeg and/or pumpkin spice.
Wynkoop Drunkin Pumpkin;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub. Pours hazy dark amber. Pie spice aroma. Medium body. Seems to have actual pumpkin flavor - mild on spice. So a bit bland, but a refreshing pumpkin version.
Wynkoop Drunkin Pumpkin;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours hazy cloudy reddish brown with a medium white head. Has a very pumpkiny starchy flavor with far less pie spices than most beers of this ilk. It’s good, but it’s not great.
Wynkoop Drunkin Pumpkin;Denver, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Draft Wynkoop 11/4/08-Pours a murky deep amber with a nice covering for a head.

Grolsch Light Lager;Boekelo, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);way too hoppy way too minerally in taste way too light way too little flavor so many friends told me they loved this beer me? not at all............

Aroma of sweet grains and a touch of corn. Thin flavor in a creamy body of distant grains. just the slightest taste of cereal in a light fizzy seltzer. It is good, not great.

Grolsch Light Lager;Boekelo, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);12 ounce bottle available at Total Wine Pembroke Pines, FL for $1.29 Very good for a light.
Grolsch Light Lager;Boekelo, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Standard lager pour with a touch of head and very little lacing. Nice golden color, but the aroma and flavor is pretty typical of a green bottle import. Not much difference between this and the standard Grolsch in my mind.
Grolsch Light Lager;Boekelo, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Bottle. Pours a light straw body with a white head. a bit skunky bitter and simple not much to enjoy here. Pass pass pass by it.

Zero Gravity Fallbock;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Poured into a pilsener glass, the appearance was a ruddy semi-dark orange color with a three finger white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Moderate messy lace. The aroma had some toffee malts and some sweet crackers to biscuity warmth. Subtle grassy hops. The flavor leans malty sweet. Biscuity to cracker leads into the aftertaste and on into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Mild carbonation. Malty smoothness rolls over my tongue. Overall, pretty good Dunkelbock, I think I could come back to.
Zero Gravity Fallbock;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Deep orange, lacing sticky light beige head. Deep bready nose comes out heavily herbal and almost vegetal in its graininess, the whole accompanied by a contextual toasted note. Becomes a bit generic in mouth where caramelized herbs sleep under the giant doughy maltiness, up front and creating a large malty feel. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, sweet take without much of the expected fruitiness.
Zero Gravity Fallbock;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Raisins, grapes and plums along with light cocoa in the aroma. Clear, deep amber-copper coloured body with a low, off white head that recedes to ring. Fruity flavours are joined by cocoa like powdery chocolate with some notes of alcohol and moderate bitterness. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Sampled on tap at the brewpub with beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, muzzlehatch, Rastacouere and Yowie.
Zero Gravity Fallbock;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;The Lure: Berries surface atop the caramel puddle. Sadly, one must look closely to witness this cute protrusion. The Festivities: An athletic body pushes forth earthy sweetness and berries. Not enough sweet malts for my tastes in the style, but again this is brewed with talent. Quite fruity and drinkable for this size. Transcendence: Walking in the suburbs.
Zero Gravity Fallbock;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Pours a reddish amber color with a thin white head. Aroma of cabbage, fruits, malt. Flavor of cabbage, fruits and malt, the malt doesn’t feel rich or round. Light to medium body with a dry, powdery texture and soft carbonation. Unremarkable, on the verge of boring.
Zero Gravity Fallbock;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Draught pint at the brewpub, 11/5/2005 with Muzzlehatch. Minimally filtered, brassy-orange with some strong beige-to-pencil-yellow hues and a very small, rather poorly retained off-white to beige colored head. Aroma shows dry toffee and caramel with tons of lager yeast. Nice bockiness, with some caramel corn notes and a touch of light, dry, yellow fruits. Strong, but mostly just sweet caramel malts and lager yeast. Flavor begins with plenty of sticky, sweet caramel and toffee, followed by some lightly drying, yeast notes, moderately acidic, lightly sour toasted grains/munich malts and a hint of soft, grassy hops. Plenty more yeast, which dosent quite balance the sticky caramel. The complexity is lacking, which creates some fatigue on the palate, when drinking a whole pint. The carbonation is low to moderate and the mouthfeel is sticky, with a touch of bready dryness on the texture as it warms. Well-concealed alcohol and low hops, with plenty of yeast and sweetness. It’s well-done to style and maybe batch two will yield a bit more complexity/balance.
Zero Gravity Fallbock;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Draught pint at the brewpub. Deep copper-bronze, faintly hazy, with a smallish lasting creamy head...nose is all caramel, rich deep lightly burnt caramel, touches of vanilla and a hint of licorice, but mostly CARAMEL....body is lightly alcoholic, warming and just a touch bitter towards the finish, very sweet but not syrupy, lightly smoky/toasty, with some lovely woody chestnut notes towards the finish. Not phenomenal by any means, but another nice German-style addition to this brewpub’s growing repertoire in the area.
Library Oktoberfest;Houghton, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Library Bar & Restaurant;Draught at The Library, Houghton, MI. Clear golden color with a tiny white head.

Library Oktoberfest;Houghton, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Library Bar & Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub. Translucent amber body, thin clumping off-white head. Sweet, caramely nose with butterscotch and grassy hops. Body is toasty and sweet with Munichy berry notes, finishing grassy and bitter. Has a pretty dense flavor profile for a relatively light beer.
Library Oktoberfest;Houghton, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Library Bar & Restaurant;Clear reddish orange pour with thin white head. Bright, fresh sweet clear malt aroma. Earthy and grainy malt flavor, very rich and full. Chewy. A touch of cocoa, pumpkin, caramel, oats and cream. Quite sweet. Fantastic o-fest!

Library Belgian Tripel;Houghton, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Library Bar & Restaurant;Gold color with no head. Very faint malty aroma. Light yeasty and Lysol flavor.
Library Belgian Tripel;Houghton, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Library Bar & Restaurant;Cloudy dark caramel banana colored pour, with little ivory head and lots of carbonation. Rich rum raisins, cream, toffee and lots of alcohol aroma. Running with lots of esters, hexane and a touch of diacetyl. Peculiar, with an off band-aid hexane dominated flavor brought on by a really strong belgian yeast. Fusels dominate. Rubbery. Still has caramel a the notable Saaz. A dry yeasty bite on the back end. Lacks much depth, complexity or character. For me, too dominated by the hexane. Good malt and sharp fruits on the smack.
Tun Tavern Pullers Pride Pilsner;Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tun Tavern;on tap-pours a white head. Color is clear gold with lots of effervescence (as all of Tun’s offerings were today). Aroma is grain. Taste is malty, alcohol and dry.

Pours beautiful deep reddish copper color with a creamy beige head that lasts well leaving good lacing. Aroma is very mild and understated, hints of biscuity malts and dusty, earthy hops. Flaover is mild also, roasty malts - more like what I would expect in a brown ale rather than an ESB - also has lots of earthy and dusty hops. Medium body and gentle carbonation.

Redoak Märzen Lager;Sydney, Australia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"Draught as part of a paddle at Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe, Sydney, on October 13, 2015. At 5.6% ABV. ""German Dark Lager"". Malty, grainy, light roasted, a bit acidic taste. Metallic, acidic aftertaste. Clear brown color, teal head with lacing. Medium mouthfeel, medium low bitterness. Acidic, malty, grainy scent."
Redoak Märzen Lager;Sydney, Australia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;2011 release on tap @ Redoak in Sydney (4.7% ABV). Pours clear light copper-brown with a decent sized off-white head. I get strawberries on the nose for some reason together with light toasted malts. Tongue is pleasant medium sweet malts with soft hop bitterness to finish. Smooth and very drinkable with a lowish carbonation and medium-light body. A fine dark lager for a session.
Redoak Märzen Lager;Sydney, Australia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"Kinda weird but works ok. Palate showed good balance with the malts, medium weight, but also combined with a cheesy, pongy note. Fault maybe? I’ve marked it down as ’complexity’. Otherwise this beer reads well to the que card; toasty malt, moderate levels of bitterness and a firmness from the 6.2%. Almost like a bitter from the UK, putting the ABV to one side."
Redoak Märzen Lager;Sydney, Australia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;on tap at redoak. copperish colour with a steady white head, aroma of caramel and tinned fruit. smooth mouthfeel, perhaps a little dry for the style, modest bitterness. pretty drinkable anyways
Redoak Märzen Lager;Sydney, Australia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;A sweet toffee-flavoured marzen - full of crystal malt I would guess. Quite liked it, although as Ecze observes, that crystal malt flavour has become a bit of a signature note here as it crops up in a lot of the range. This looked good, clear bronze with a thick, lasting head. Aroma seemed to be all toffee, with a smokey hint of peated malt (as used in the Scottish and Scotch ales?) Mainly toffee again on the tongue, with some star anise. Quite a phlegmy bitter finish that verged on the cloying. One of these was enough for me. (Draught at brewpub)
Redoak Märzen Lager;Sydney, Australia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Draught at the brewpub. Clear dark amber, small but lasting head. Toffee aroma. Strong butterscotch flavour. Sweet with fairly soft mouthfeel. Roasty and quite thick with a fair amount of grassy hops and notes of licorice. Complex and interesting, but more of a bock than a Märzen.
Redoak Märzen Lager;Sydney, Australia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Tap at Redoak. Looks good, had a massive solid head. Loads of Munich malt flavour without being cloying or sweet at all really, but slightly marred by a bit of oxidation. Regardless, it impressed me a great deal, in a straighforward kinda way. I’ve never had a Märzen which tasted all that strongly of Munich malt (as I know it,) but this works well. (Interesting that eczematic says basically the complete opposite!)
Redoak Märzen Lager;Sydney, Australia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;"i dunno why they bother having oktoberfest, vienna, and ""märzen"" - along with the bock that = a lot of sweet 6%ish lagers. in fact i’ve noticed that if there is a trend at this place it is towards SWEET beers - perhaps designed to saccharify their way into the hearts of CBD ladies and the gents that want to buy them beers. look through the lineup - nothing over 30 IBUs, everything either caramelly sweet or adulterated with chocolate, fruit, christmas spices, etc... anyway. this beer is not my thing - amber, cloyingly sweet, full of crystal malt and not much else. slight peppery bitterness bubbles up through the syrup at the end. they don’t seem to have the knack of getting maltiness without sweetness here."
Redoak Märzen Lager;Sydney, Australia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Very good look in the glass with its fine coppery hue and clean head. I left this for a while while the lovely Janet poured me a taster of the Dunkel as an aperitif. During that time it settled down a fair bit from the initial creamy head to a reasonable, lets say, horizonatal lacing (actually I like that term). The nose is a very toasty maltiness with a touch of bublegum that is not necessarily a bad sensation. The flavour is malty and assertive on the palate and in mouthfeel. Good bitter aftertaste and a fine balance. Janet advises me she will try to extract the hop variety used by the brewer Dave as soon as she can. What a difference a good barside manner makes to the enjoyment of a beer and always it is a pleasure to meet a gorgeous lady who loves her beer.

Pours clear, dark ambercopper / brown. Small white head. Smell is oxidation. 100 % oxidation, but not very intense scent. Taste is oxidation, dark Sugar ( still tasting like Sugar !) and of course the familliar Portorization. not a lot of other things going on. Medium to low body, medium carbo. Nothing truly offensive here, but just an oxidized beer without too much depth or complexity to make it a great old beer.
Gulden Draak Vintage;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Pours orange golden color, with a Small White head in the conors. The aroma is dominated by friuts, soo is the sent. The taste has hints of caramel and whisky. And a bitter sweet end

Gulden Draak Vintage;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Een zeer kruidige drank, iets beter dan de gewone versie. Ideaal voor op de Kerstmarkt.
Gulden Draak Vintage;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;BB date of 9 Sep 2012. It’s a gusher. Pours ruby red with huge mocha head that recedes to a thin layer after about 3 minutes. The aroma is somewhat like an English barleywine - sweet malt and candi sugar, preserved cherries, raisins, booze. The taste matches the aroma, with the cherry flavour particularly prominent. Very sweet and almost medicinal up front before drying out and finishing with a very light bitterness. Some oxidation. Light to medium bodied, especially compared to the original Gulden Draak, lightly acidic and sticky. Not quite as good as the original version.
Gulden Draak Vintage;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;On tap at Tap and Mallet. Quite good, not great. Dark brown with faint orange highlights and a medium thick head with moderate lacing and minimal retention. Very full rich aroma of dark ripe fruit, yeast, bread dough. Palate is thick, sticky, sweet, full of plums. Alcohol well hidden. Some medicinal notes detract.

Gulden Draak Vintage;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Dark brown with a lively tan head. Roasted aroma, tastes of alcohol and malt. Should age well.
Gulden Draak Vintage;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"Lighter winter version of the classic Gulden Draak since 2005, with a malty, yeasty and spicy (coriander) character, but less sweet than the regular; caramel and nutty malts, dryish taste with some candied fruits, bitterish finish. Basically a downtuned version of their regular Gulden Draak - and in that sense equally purposeless as e.g. Duvel Groen. Never understood why Van Steenberge came up with this in the first place. But not a bad Belgian ale, generally speaking."

North Yorkshire Dizzy Dick;Warrenby, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Yorkshire Brewing Co.;Cask conditioned at The Mason's Arms, Headington, Oxford. Brown with white head. This proved to be a pretty basic twiggy bitter, earthy, dryish. It's okay.
North Yorkshire Dizzy Dick;Warrenby, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Yorkshire Brewing Co.;Bottle from Wine & Beer Direct, Halifax. Closing down sale stock, it’s been in my cellar for 3 years and hasn’t aged well unfortunately.

North Yorkshire Dizzy Dick;Warrenby, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;North Yorkshire Brewing Co.;Bottle thanks to allmyvinyl. Appearance - amber with a thin head.

Castlemaine XXXX Draught;Milton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);On tap at Mooloolaba Surf Club.

Castlemaine XXXX Draught;Milton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I had this at a Ned Kelly’s steak house, back then they first were opening around the US and had Australian beer on tap. It is very light and very low on flavor. Fine for what it is but make sure mug is frosty cold and the day is hot, otherwise all bets are off. Serving: Tap
Castlemaine XXXX Draught;Milton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);No nonsense earthy beer with pleasant after taste, especially good on a hot day after hard work or play. Gone out of production (for now) but still some around.
Castlemaine XXXX Draught;Milton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Easy drinking, lightly carbonated beer which is particularly refreshing in the winter. Not recommended for afficianados of European style Pilsners as it has dark and earthy characteristics that were common in Australian beers such as Tooheys from the 1950s and 1960s. Unfortunately the strength has been reduced from 4.8% ABV to 4.5%. Not available outside Queensland as far as I know. By the way, this beer is not XXXX bitter, it is a different beer, with a red and yellow label and is quite different to any XXXX beers brewed overseas on licence.
Castlemaine XXXX Draught;Milton, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Castlemaine Perkins Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Found this to be one of Castlemaines worst tasting when it came out.Was malty but seemed to have a bland chalky like flavour that finished with a dry malt grainy flavour almost tasteless and nauseating.It has not changed pleased to tip it into a drain pipe,a real dud even after the decent head and golden pour that gave it some look.

Riegele Leichte Weisse;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauhaus Riegele;50cl bottle at the brewery. Pours a lightly hazed, straw colored body with a finger-width, foamy and frothy, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is thinner, grainy wheats with a light citrus, some clove, hints of banana, and a bit of a hay note. Flavor is similar. Thin, grainy wheats with some straw, a decent citrus note, a light clove, and a few banana hints. Finishes clean and dry with a very light bitterness before leaving a short aftertaste. Thin body and a somewhat active, medium-high carbonation. Overall, clearly this is a thinner beer, but for a light Weiss, this is pretty good. Easy drinking and enjoyable for the style.

Riegele Hell Alkoholfrei;Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauhaus Riegele;I bought this bottle at amstein. I drank it at home, after the work during these cold days. In my point of view, it is a pleasant beer free of alcohol. It sounds a pils: herbal side, nice touch of hop, bitterness, malt, a bit watery. The carbonation is regular, gold color, when you pour the beer, consistent white foam. Feldschlösschen could take an example about this beer. I drank this beer again yesterday night at Paris in my room hotel, the bottle came from Amstein. I don't know, if we are speaking about the same beer, my bottle on this case was not so hoppy than the first version time, gold color, average/low carbonation, thin and white foam. The taste was a bit sour, malty, bready, watery, almost no hop, not so exciting but it is drinkable, if your liver is sick.

John Harvards Low Down Common Lager;Washington DC, Washington DC, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;John Harvards Brewhouse Washington DC;"On tap in DC. This seems to be a pretty well done California Common. It looks like my notes say ""Dry hopped with Diesel"", but no, on further review, it was dry hopped with Chinook. The effervescent body and spicy green piney hop combine well and it all ends up quite refreshing."
John Harvards Low Down Common Lager;Washington DC, Washington DC, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;John Harvards Brewhouse Washington DC;Draft at the DC location on 11-12-05. Amber bodied with some light fruit notes, floral hops and mild maltiness. Taste is citrusy and decently hopped with a hint of pine, mild fruit notes and decent malt backbone.

John Harvards Low Down Common Lager;Washington DC, Washington DC, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;John Harvards Brewhouse Washington DC;Draft in D.C.... Hazy, golden lager with orange highlights. Large, frothy, egg shell head. Great retention. The mild, subtle nose is a touch earthy and floral with small notes of straw, pepper and fallen apple. Perfectly balanced, but bland. A touch of citrus. Light-bodied and fizzy. Short, crisp, dry finish.

Pouts a brackisg amber with big, indeed combined coke and Weizen head. Aroma of cherry coke and banana, not getting any lemongrass. Taste is thin, cherry coke and weak weizen fruitness on a cardboard palate, sticky finish with a lingering brackish aftertaste. Still more drinkable than Fürstenberg’s soapy beers.

Jab³onowo Belfast Limited Edition;Wólka Kosowska, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Jablonowo;"Sold as stout, looks like an ale and is a strong lager. But nevermind - it is quite good actually. Heavy, syrupy slightly sweet with some honey notes. Alcoholic, but considering it’s 10% it looks very nice. Good, kinda reminds me of Hevelius Kaper; pity it’s a special edition and probably won’t be around for too much."
Hexapoda;Sint-Truiden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Kerkom;Commissioned dry-hopped session ale for the 50th birthday of students’ club Vilvordia, the hosts of a beer festival held every year in spring in Jette near Brussels. Only Belgian ingredients are used. Yellowish white, thick, creamy head, light orange blonde colour, clear at first but becoming cloudy when more from the bottle is added. Earthy aroma of grapefruit, peach, rancid butter, old cheese, sherry, spicy hops, peat, honey, fried eggs and even a faint hint of smoked herring. Short fruitiness in the mouth, caramel malts, spicy and sourish, very earthy and very dry, smoky touch again, evolving into a long, dry, peppery and rooty hop bitterness. Interesting beer which has clearly undergone some ageing, which has made it almost saison-like.
Hexapoda;Sint-Truiden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Kerkom;Draft @ Vilvordia Bierproef Festival, Jette, Brussels. Pours a golden color with a small white head. Has a sweetish malty slightly hoppy aroma with some citrus hints. Sweetish malty hoppy bitter flavor. Has a sweetish malty hoppy finish with some bitterness in the aftertaste.
Hexapoda;Sint-Truiden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Kerkom;Draft at Vilvordia fest. Sweetish malty nose with a creamy orange aspect, like mandarine sorbet. Lightly sweet, bit of candi sugar taste, and reasonably bitter flavor for balance. Finish is on the dry side. Pretty nice overall.
Hexapoda;Sint-Truiden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Kerkom;(Draught at VBPF08 on 2008-05-18) Golden colour. Hazy. White small head. Malty sweet nose. Fizzy palate. Finnish easter pudding in taste. Hops and some raisin, too. Very good beer.
Hexapoda;Sint-Truiden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Kerkom;Bottle, 33 cl. Many thx to Steven V. Hazy dark golden color, with small white head. Aroma hops, yeast, fruity, bit spicy.

Hexapoda;Sint-Truiden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Kerkom;33 cl bottle, bottled in Aug 05. Clear, shiny light amber with a small, disappearing head.

Gets points for putting the ingredients and the bottling date on the label.
Hexapoda;Sint-Truiden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Kerkom;Bottle. Hazy amber with a medium white head. A nice aroma of toffee and spicy hops. Sweet flavours balanced by very aromatic hoppiness. Dry finish. Rather light body. A positive surprise.
Hexapoda;Sint-Truiden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Kerkom;Hazy pale amber color with a smallish head. Acidic, a bit stuffy aroma with saaz hops, honey and flower hints. Quite acidic, dry and malty flavor with hints of honey and lots of saazy hops in the finish. Medium-bodied, quite carbonated palate. Hops (3 types mentioned in the label) have clearly been used in generous amounts, but the brew feels off balance to me. Too acidic, and needs more maltiness to balance the hops. Brewed for a student club, but I seriously doubt even they like it that much. Gotta give some credit in the overall score for using enough hops (46 EBU), though. It actually gets slightly better towards the end :)
Lazy Magnolia Indian Summer;Kiln, Mississippi, United States;Wheat Ale;Lazy Magnolia Brewing Company;Bottle. Bright wheat malt aroma with notes of orange peel and coriander spice.

Lazy Magnolia Indian Summer;Kiln, Mississippi, United States;Wheat Ale;Lazy Magnolia Brewing Company;Courtesy of Nick Bottle: The aroma consists of light orange peel, grass, lemon, and a hint of spice. It pours a transparent dark gold with a two finger off-white head that has good retention. There are some nice soapy rings left on the sides of the glass for every sip. The flavor starts with a moderate dose of tangy citrus and wheat. The finish has some light orange peel, lemon, corriander, and a touch of grain. It’s light bodied with moderate-lively carbonation. Overall, probably a better than average American Wheat that is a least worthy of being called an decent lawnmower beer.
Lazy Magnolia Indian Summer;Kiln, Mississippi, United States;Wheat Ale;Lazy Magnolia Brewing Company;Bottle. Cloudy gold color with a really big head. Aroma was slight orange with a touch of spice. Taste was weak. Some spicy, sweet citrus.

Lazy Magnolia Indian Summer;Kiln, Mississippi, United States;Wheat Ale;Lazy Magnolia Brewing Company;The nose on this beer is all coriander, and the taste isn’t very different. Slight undertones of Orange zest, surprisingly un-hoppy. I’m sure this would be very good on a hot day, but I can think of a number of beers I’d grab first in the event of the inevitable Texas heatwave.

Cambridge Newtowne Colonial Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Cambridge Brewing Company;NEBF ’05 Brown in color with a off-white head. Aroma is complex,bready,malty,sweet with a little dark fruit. Flavor is sweet,chooclately,nutty with soem interesting fruit esters.
Cambridge Newtowne Colonial Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Cambridge Brewing Company;On draught at CBC, 10/27/2005, with Crosling. Served a nicely unfiltered chartreuse-brown color, with a small off-white/cream colored head, fair retention. Aroma serves up chocolate, honey graham crackers, molasses, raisins and then a bit of sourdough on the end. Low hops profile, but what’s there is nice and flavorful (green floral and juicy, mildly herbal). Flavor is chocolatey, with lightly toasted grains, brown sugar and prunes on the end. Light hoppiness is apparent and tastefully done, while there is a lightly dry vanilla-liqueur/extract like flavor lingering in the background that is quite pleasant and balances the sweet choco-toffee malt. Fresh and with a low carbonation, lightly chewy texture. No alcohol apparency. Cherry and raisin fruitiness becomes quite apparent as it warms. Dry grainy notes mixed with chocolate linger on pleasantly.

Poured with a very small head that quickly became a mere thin film on the beer. Some fair lacing left behind. Body is a burnt-orange color and very cloudy. S: Very strong aroma of wet hops and some light citrus. T: The citrus comes through at the beginning, but then finishes moderately bitter and quite dry, with a fairly long duration. M: Medium-bodied with a creamy texture, and soft-to-average carbonation. D: Moderately hoppy and flavorful, fairly easy to drink. Worth getting for sure, although difficult to tell from lack of info how long this beer is available for.
Amnesia Fresh Hop Ale;Washougal, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Amnesia Brewing;Rose & Raindrop - Great bar, perhaps my favorite place to drink beer in Portland. Really nice golden amber pour, with an aroma that pervades your nostrils, jumping right out of the glass. Has that same mineral earthiness that I get from all Amnesia beers, must be from the water at the brewery. Lots of simcoe in the nose, pleasant mouthfeel, with a light honey glazed bready maltiness. Nicely done.
Amnesia Fresh Hop Ale;Washougal, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Amnesia Brewing;Tap at Rose and Raindrop for the cask fest. Deep amber colored and lightly hazy.

Amnesia Fresh Hop Ale;Washougal, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Amnesia Brewing;Tap at The Rose and the Raindrop. Light amber colour, thick, fluffy white head and sticky lace. Aroma is first hoppy, light spiciness backing up a huge citrusy grapefruit aroma. Flavour is also hop-dominated, but well balanced. Sweet and lightly bready with biscuity malts playing off of the bright citrus profile. Clean and well-balanced. Nice APA.
Green Mill Pumpkin;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Definitely pumpkin pie smell and taste, however it seems like cheap pumpkin pie spice. Body is watered down and lacks the malt basis to support the pumpkin.

Green Mill Pumpkin;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Copper Coloring with Sandy Ring. Pumpkin Spice Aroma. Watery Overall But Good Malt Background and Pumpkin Spices and Hops on the Aftertaste. The Flavors Were Still Present and Enjoyable on the Tongue. Too Many of These Are Great on the Nose and Lacking on the Taste Buds. Cheers to a Decent Pumpkin Ale!
Green Mill Pumpkin;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;Dark copper color with no head. Good aroma of pumpkin and cloves. The taste leaves much to be desired as it is really just watered down pumpkin juice, but it’s probably (unfortunately) one of the better offerings from Green Mill.
Green Mill Pumpkin;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Green Mill Restaurant & Bar;"A seasonal from The Green Mill, where the pizza is always better than the beer. Mild pumpkin quality (not at all off-putting) with a little spice but clearly leaning more to pumpkin than pumpkin spice. A slight burnt note. Moderate palate, quite ""normal"" for a brewpub. Yellow/golden color. Not too bad. (on tap at brewpub)"

Aroma is very sweet with vanilla and oak notes detectable again. Taste is the same, very sweet up front with vanilla and oak notes on the end. Very sweet throughout, but a very solid beer.

Not much else to say. The flavor is the same. Body is a bit boozy and heavy on the oak. It masks anything else, but it’s still kinda tasty and warming. Reminds me of a nice oakey bourbon.

Allagash Four - Barrel Aged;Portland, Maine, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Allagash Brewing Company;Extreme Beer Fest 2/15/08: After really enjoying the regular version of this beer, I was excited to try the bourbon barrel-aged version. However, all the things that I liked about the Four (Belgian fruits, lightness) just did not mesh with the bourbon and the bourbon completely dominated this beer.
Allagash Four - Barrel Aged;Portland, Maine, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Allagash Brewing Company;"Sample at the EBF Night of the Barrels. Aroma of apple, yeast and bourbon; some wood as well. The flavor was really smooth and the alcohol was well hidden. After really liking the original version, the barrel aging added some different elements. Some good sweentess too."
Allagash Four - Barrel Aged;Portland, Maine, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Allagash Brewing Company;EBF V NOTB. This was basically the regular Allagash Four being smothered by bourbon. Everything in my rating on the regular Four still applies, except there’s bourbon in the way. I didn’t really think it was a pleasing addition and came away thinking that the Four just wasn’t hearty enough to stand up to the liquor.
Allagash Interlude;Portland, Maine, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Allagash Brewing Company;Backlog, not sure how I missed this one. Amber orange color with a small to medium khaki head.

With an aggressive pour, I get a small to medium sized, cream colored head that soon settled out and no lace. Color is a hazy apricot. Aroma is fantastic, literally, with yeast, Brett, malt, wine fruitiness, caramel. Flavor is like aroma and has the acid from the yeastoids and gas to cut through the sweet malts and residual sweetness of the wine barrels along with the bitterness of the hops and yeast. Complex. Body is very good and too the carbonation. Finish is like flavor and includes alcohol warming. Would be good both before and after a great meal.

Taste is lightly sour, but a few notches above minimally so. There is some sweetness intermixing, so it is kind of like mixing sour and sweet cherries, but still having the beer tastes dominate. The finish is really woody and so is the aftertaste. I am like this.

Big Horn Pumpkin Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Tap @ The Ram. Hazy orange-brown pour with a short beige head leaving minimal lace. Nose is lightly spicy and nicely malty. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Oodles of pumpkin pie flavors here: pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, mace and a bit of biscuit and maybe even a dollop of whipped cream near the end. Finish is sweet, but there is some woody umami and a touch of hoppy bittering which is resinous and quite pleasant. Mightily impressed with this one, one of the better pumpkin ales of the 2011 season and compares well to the ST Pumking.

Big Horn Pumpkin Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);"Draft at GPBF. Poured through a pumpkin (tapped, not pinned). Pours a cloudy and almost nitro-looking grainy dark caramel amber. Big creamy thick disc of mousse on top. Big pumpkin cookie nose. Creamy medium body--like a nitro but only about 5% of the effect; it gains a creaminess rather than being left flat and chalky (but it’s not really on nitro, so that’s just for reference). Caramel and pumpkin cookie mid-palate. Nice sweet finish. A little too desserty for some, but it works if you like it sweet."

Big Horn Pumpkin Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);On tap at Ram Brew pub. Light yellow hued ale having frizzy white diminishing head with spare lacing. Overwhelming nutmeg aroma due to added freshly ground nutmeg on beer head. Light-to-medium bodied that starts and finishes with very watery, sugar malt flavor and strong nutmeg flavor due to added nutmeg powder. Not a very memorable but drinkable beer.

Earlier Rating: 11/4/2007 Total Score: 3.5 From a growler - Growler from 11/02/07, drank on 11/03/07. Cloudy orange, very thin head. Oddly restrained aroma - definately pumpkin pie, but not overpowering. Much more agressive flavor. Not really pumpkin pie, but more like pumpkin bread, with cinnamon, nutmeg and clove, plus some vanilla notes. In fact, I’m gonna it reminds me of Pumpkin bread with a bit of vanilla frosting. It’s very tasty but a growler is a bit...much. Actually towards the end of the evening, we discovered that if you mix it with a pale ale it cuts the sweetness nicely.
Smoky Mountain Sleepy Hollow Pumpkin Ale;Gatlinburg, Tennessee, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Smoky Mountain Brewery & Restaurant;Draft at brewery. Absolute worst pumpkin beer I have ever tasted. One of the worst beers I have tried period. Cloyingly sweet with an artificial saccharin like taste to it. Fortunately I only ordered one for the wife.

Früh Kölsch Alkoholfrei;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Cölner Hofbräu P. Josef Früh;"Another laudable German lager with the booze sucked out. Deep gold with steady carb and a somewhat scummy froth. Inviting shrub, honey, cherry blossom aspects to the nose, giving way to bicarbonate. Decent taste, albeit with another big ladle of bicarb; earthy grass sap, honey, biscotti and gummy lemon. Flecks of conifer. Lingering, corn-like vanilla aftertaste. Bit of a slimy mouthfeel. Good beer though. And dare I say no washier than your typical kolsch."

Früh Kölsch Alkoholfrei;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Cölner Hofbräu P. Josef Früh;I't hard for me to be fair about this one, because I don't really like Kölsch - and especially not bottled Kölsch. In my opinion, it's a reasonable effort at making an n/a brew in that style. I wish I could somehow rate it higher to express that view, but there is too much I don't like about it subjectively.

Brandon Royal Ginger;Brandon, Suffolk, England;Traditional Ale - Other;Brandon Brewery;[500ml bottle from The Real Ale Shop, Wrentham, Suffolk] The ginger flavour here is mild to say the least - a slight tingle on the tonsils and that’s it. The beer itself is pleasant enough, quite light and refreshing, but disappointed that the ginger didn’t offer more of a kick - if you want a ginger flavoured beer, try Okell’s Dr Okell’s Eastern Spice instead.

The beer pours a dark copper-amber color with a medium off-white head that diminishes quickly to an outer ring. Partial rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of pungent smoke and malt. Medium body with a smoked malt character and notes of dark fruit and hops. The finish is charred malt and smoked meats. A little too far on the smoky side for my taste but decent overall.

Aroma is oxidized to hell- soy saltiness with almost a meat-like character comign formt eh soy and smoke- smoke is a dull wet smoldering campfire, and has a slight sherry mix in there as well. Raisins apples and other fruits int he flavor- some dull smoke again wet paper and sherry oxidation, salty and brine-like with a slight acetic acid kick in the end- sharp fusels, esters and a prickly smoke kick. Blech.

Not one that I would repeat soon. Disappointing...

JosephsBrau Winterfest (WinterBrew);Monrovia, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Josephbrau Winter Brew - 35F Foam quiet and timid, as if scolded for being so cold, i should be scolded for serving it so cold. Huger foam, a real gentle giant this one is. Nice bite, like a mid sized shark, slightly angered and also hungry - a three way combo of roasted malt, bittering hops and carbonation. It’s still somehow smooth despite the robust bitterness, like the shaven calf of a bodybuilder mailman, cut yet hairless. Dark dark brown, clear, light tan head, again with bitterness like some kind of root is included in today’s mail. It mentions monks, and perhaps some of the ones who might have brewed this were not totally at peace with the celibacy vow, and thus the bitterness. Mellows in time, as the testosterone levels lower. Winds up being a nice friend to just cuddle up with, not worried it’s gonna pull a fast one despite the 7.5%, it’s learned to hold it’s own and stay cool even on the harder stuff.

Nothing spectacular, but a very pleasant and easy to drink Lager.
Sulwath Galloway Gold;Castle Douglas, Scotland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sulwath Brewers;500ml bottle from Aldi. The aroma is wheat malt and lemon. The taste has light sweetness, a little sourness and lemon on the finish. Quite good but a bit bland.

Bridge of Allan UEFA Cup Final Ale;Stirling, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bridge Of Allan (Traditional Scottish Ales);Bottled. Very ugly toxic green coloured. Nearly no aroma.

Stadin Special Bitter;Helsinki, Finland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stadin Panimo;(This beer rating was imported from FB and unfortunately lacks any further comments.)
Stadin Special Bitter;Helsinki, Finland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stadin Panimo;(Draught at Hilpeä Hauki, Helsinki, on 2009-01-08. Boadicea hops were used in this version.) Dark amber. Lightly hazy. White, medium sized and quite quickly disappearing head. Grass, malts and berries in nose. Full bodied and dry palate with medium carbonation. Bitterness, malts, sweetness and cranberry like flavours and sourness. Long lasting bitter aftertaste. The berry flavours make me assume that something must have gone wrong in making this batch.
Stadin Special Bitter;Helsinki, Finland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stadin Panimo;Draught (Kaisla, Helsinki)<br /> Rich reddy-brown, little head, but with some colour to it. Sweet fruity and sour aroma - framboise, perhaps. A little fizzy as it’s from keg, but when that subsides, there’s a huge smack of hops. Almost bock-like in its fullness.
Stadin Special Bitter;Helsinki, Finland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stadin Panimo;Woohoo! This is a good one. Draught, Kaisla, Helsinki. Really flowery honey aroma. Mead/dark cola colour, thick beige head. Taste bitter with nuts and toast. Very long bitterness in the finish. Creamy on the palate.
Stadin Special Bitter;Helsinki, Finland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stadin Panimo;Draught. Red-brown color, small but beautiful creamy, white head. Dry, flowery hop aroma. Very dry palate. Man, this is one bitter bitter. A dry, flowery, bitter hop flavor, with a bitter, lingering aftertaste. Good example of its type, but a bit too one-dimensionally bitter for my taste. Half a pint would’ve been enough -- after that, the monotonic bitterness grew quite tiresome.
Stadin Special Bitter;Helsinki, Finland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stadin Panimo;Draught. Brownish with a minor white head. The aroma is stinging with a scent fhops (amarillo was one suggestion). The flavour is bitter, bitter and bitter. It’s fruity with a grassy after taste.
Stadin Special Bitter;Helsinki, Finland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stadin Panimo;(Draught@Hauki) Hazy darkish red with a small, lighty lacy head. Lots of red currants in the aroma, with very little room for anything else. Currants also dominate the flavor. Medium body, soft carbonation. I dont think this is what the brewer was aiming for. Drinkable, but will not score again. (Draught, was 7-4-7-4-14=3.6) Very hazy reddish color with a small, lasting head. Pleasantly smooth, slightly sour, dryish aroma with berries and mellow hops. Quite strongly bitter flavor with lots of dryish fruitiness and a dry, hoppy finish. Medium-bodied quite low-carbonated palate. A very nice and enjoyable bitter.

Stadin Special Bitter;Helsinki, Finland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Stadin Panimo;Draught Amber brown color with shades of red, small off-white head, some lace. Aromatic flowery hoppy nose. Medium-bodied, balanced palate. Allthough this is made from English hops, it gives American type generous IPA flowery hoppy feeling. Sierra Nevada is brewery which comes first to my mind. Long bitter aftertaste. Only malt profile does not hold till the finish.
Hadrian & Border Byker Jazz;Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hadrian Border Brewery;Cask at filmhouse edinburgh ... light amber ... thin bubbly head white head ... dryish lager hop nose ... sweet soft lemon hop ... very subdued flavour profile .... little blackcurrant...
Hadrian & Border Byker Jazz;Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hadrian Border Brewery;Cask, Bodega, Newcastle. Pallid golden colour with little in the way of head. Aroma was caramel malt and muffled citrus. A bit rough around the edges. Sweetish, rather drab flavour. Ok, but forgettable.
Hadrian & Border Byker Jazz;Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hadrian Border Brewery;[Cask at The Three Judges] Clear caramel colour, minimal head. Aroma of caramel, toffee, some citric notes and some berry fruit. medium body, sweet, fruity palate, dry finish.

Roosters Outlaw Bullet;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Roosters Brewing;"Cask at the Maltings, York. Golden amber with a one finger dense white head that fades to an ever-present cap. Aroma is slightly indistinct, with slight toffee notes and a hint of grassy and citrus hop. Slight grassy or hay notes upfront, with caramel and more toffee, which fades to orange and grapefruit citric - more juicy than they are rasping on the tongue; quite pleasurable in that regard. A very subdued and pleasant aftertaste that carries on the citrus notes and is slightly dry. Smooth and full on the tongue."
Roosters Outlaw Bullet;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Roosters Brewing;Cask Handpump at the Manor Arms Hotel, Broughton-In-Furness 29/10/2005. Golden coloured with some hoppiness and a long lasting dry finish with a hint of bitterness.

Brooklyn Winter (Christmas) Ale (2005 and earlier);Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);dark reddish brown color with a medium sized head. An incredibly strong and spicy aroma and taste.
Brooklyn Winter (Christmas) Ale (2005 and earlier);Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Bottle (from the november 2005 RB-tasting at Dixens place - notes have been damaged by flooding of my basement, but this was such an insane tasting for me as I was new to such massive tastings, so I gave up on the detailed notes quite early). Pumpkin, indecisive beer. All I wrote. Last of the evening, hence the few notes.
Brooklyn Winter (Christmas) Ale (2005 and earlier);Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Bottle. good brown color. aroma: christmas spices and maltiness. taste: a good clean roasted malted flavor and then the christmas spices come in for a clean finish.

Brooklyn Winter (Christmas) Ale (2005 and earlier);Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Tasting notes 2005. Brown with an ok head. Exciting sweet and spicy aroma of cinnamon and honey. But the flavours are nof equally uplifting, being malty sweet and again with some spice but quickly fading out.
Brooklyn Winter (Christmas) Ale (2005 and earlier);Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Deep brown in color. A little spicy bread on the nose. The alcohol is hidden behind malt and bread. The sweet (yet dry) spicyness is perfect for a winter brew.
Brooklyn Winter (Christmas) Ale (2005 and earlier);Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Rated 11/18/06: Generously sweet malty scent some light spices are there. Nice color but the off white head soon left and couldn’t be brought back. Medium fullness and easily drinkable, nice clean finish. Good tasting ale, sweet malts. A touch of clove perhaps with some complimenting spices although this aspect is greatly downplayed in the overall taste.
Brooklyn Winter (Christmas) Ale (2005 and earlier);Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Dark chestnut colored, with a light brown head. Aroma of cloves, nutmeg, and ginger. Lots of spiciness in the flavor, anise being the most prominent to me. Not as overwhelmingly spicy as some spiced beers. Mouthfeel is on the heavy side for the style, warming finish that may be amplified by the spices.
Brooklyn Winter (Christmas) Ale (2005 and earlier);Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Deep red and brown blends of color. The head is diminutive but dense and reluctant to fade. Incredibly spicy aroma contains clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, caramel malt, bitter chocolates in moderation, herbs and roasty malts. Flavor is much the same, the spice still dominant, caramel seems sweeter and cinnamon does as well. Palate is untamed and too spicy and jagged at times. Finishes medium dry with a peppery herbal blend and pleasing bitterness. While rough around the edges, quite nice for a smack you in the face winter beer.
Brooklyn Winter (Christmas) Ale (2005 and earlier);Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);This beer is dark brown with a little head. The aroma has notes of roasted malt, allspice and pepper. The flavour reflects the aroma, and additional notes of caramel and licorice are found. It has a light Belgian expression, but not with the same depth. It’s really nice though...

La Diable Diable;Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Microbrasserie La Diable;Birra buona. Servita a pompa direttamente dal maturatore.

Twickenham Strong & Dark Winter Warmer;Twickenham, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Twickenham Fine Ales;Nutty, a little roasted malt, rather sweet. Not bad, but I would have liked more hops in this.

A dark brown coloured beer with a complex aroma featuring nettles, earth, wood and licquorice. The taste has bready notes together with brown fruits and hints of alcohol.

Great Waters Slapshot IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;CASK: Amber Coloring with Offwhite Head. Hoppy Aroma...Wet Hops on the Tongue..Lemony Citrus Background, With a Dry Hop Finish. Lemon Notes Make it a Pretty Alluring IPA.
Great Waters Slapshot IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Gold color with a thin head. Dusty hop aroma with a little grapefruit. The flavor is mostly piney. Very dry finish. Nicely drinkable.
Great Waters Slapshot IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Cider gold, very citric nose, lots of hoppiness, good pine notes as well. Flavor has a considerable bite of hops, lots of pine again, minty spiciness. Lovely smoothness.
Great Waters Slapshot IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;On cask at the brewpub: Clouded gold at the pour but clears up nicely and becomes one of the clearest beers I’ve ever seen from the cask. Clear straw gold with a nicely fluffed off-whitish cap of medium height. Lacing is minimal with some spotty messyness. Aroma is all orange. Quite fresh and zippy with a tartly dark setting of blood and manderine orange peels. Citrusy and warm with a light bready malt backing. Taste is intially crisp and clean with an intense little zip right in front with some highly toned citrus orange peel bite. Tapers off to reveal a bit more complexity with bits of lemon peel and grapefruity zestings. All the while keeps a simple sweet malt tone of bread dough and lightly toasted malt. Bitterness is essentually quick and eager with orange peels up front then fades quickly to reveal its other qualities. Good citrusy hop flavors without a whole lot of bittering bite. Balance is toned well, but could use a boost of bite for the hop fans out there. Feel is crisp and quick with a lighter cask-conditioned body then what you might find. Simple, clean, and light. As fore mentioned, bitterness is low, hop flavors are orange-a-refically solid and present. A easy goin’ IPA, seemingly simple with a clean bold crunch of orange toned hop action thats juicy, not pulpy, and drinks down easy enough and could possibly set the stage for sessioning a couple glass fulls.
Thoroughbreds Belgian Wit;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Thoroughbreds Grill and Brewing;Hazy apple juice body with white head. Aroma is medium sweet, lemon, some cardemom. Taste is medium sweet, lemon, orange peel, cardemom. Light-medium body, decent crispness.
Teerenpeli Ruisrape;Lahti, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Teerenpeli Panimo & Tislaamo;"Draught @Teerenpeli, Helsinki Amber brown, not much head. Sweet lemony hoppy aroma. Carbonated, crisp, medium-bodied, sweetish malty, some rye in the aftertaste, but I have sampled more ryeish ""non rye lagers"" than this one."
Teerenpeli Ruisrape;Lahti, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Teerenpeli Panimo & Tislaamo;(Draught) Clear reddish amber color with a small, fading head. Very faint aroma with hints of rye and caramel. Caramely-malty flavor wth some fruitiness. No finish to speak of just fades away. Light to medium-bodied, a bit foamy-carbonated palate. A very straightforward and plain, caramely lager.
Perhon 10-Vuotisjuhlaolut;Helsinki, Finland;Specialty Grain - Other;Perhon Panimo;(Draught@Perho) Slightly hazy amber color with a smallish but firm, foamy and lacy head. Slightly sour, dryish-caramely and buttery aroma with English hops. Sourish-malty, dryish and bitter flavor with earthy hops. Lingering, dry-hoppy finish. Light to medium body, chalky palate with low carbonation. A semi-decent, dry-hoppy and sourish, bitter-style ale.
Twickenham Advantage;Twickenham, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Twickenham Fine Ales;Cask at GBBF 2006. An orange beer with no head. The aroma is sweet with light notes of hops. The flavor is sweet and very fruity combined with a light note of diacethyl. Too sweet and not enough hops to balance it.
Twickenham Advantage;Twickenham, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Twickenham Fine Ales;Cask (gravity dispense) at Ealing Beer Festival, May 2006. A conspicuously forceful session bitter. Attractive coppery amber colour. Plenty of flinty, resinous hops on the nose, but not too extreme. Dry, bitter, slightly puckering mouthfeel. Grapefruit on the flavour. Just a smidgen of dry malt. Distinctly austere, but I like bitters in that style.
Twickenham Advantage;Twickenham, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Twickenham Fine Ales;Cask @ The Roebuck, Hampton Hill (London). Dark amber / orange color with a small head. Sweet floral hop aroma with notes of roastet malt. A refreshing hoppiness with a dry and bitter slightly nutty malt fininsh.
Twickenham Advantage;Twickenham, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Twickenham Fine Ales;Cask at Bedford BF ’06. Dark orange. Sweet floral hop aroma. Only the faintest touch of citrus fruits before the slight bitter finish. Uncomplicated, middle of the road. Not bad.
Twickenham Advantage;Twickenham, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Twickenham Fine Ales;Cask Conditioned at Ealing Beer on Broadway Festival, 2006. Murky orange. Sweet malt base with heavy floral hopping. A touch of dicatyl and a soapy finish.

Twickenham Advantage;Twickenham, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Twickenham Fine Ales;Half pint gravity fed at the Battersea Beer Fest, clear golden colour with a frothy head. A very strong citrus and peach aroma - a refreshing hoppiness. A malty flavour - I’m struck by the smoothness, though the finish is overly tart.
Twickenham Advantage;Twickenham, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Twickenham Fine Ales;Cask at the Clubhouse, Twickenham. A bitter with a rather strange finish. Soapy. Not very aromatic - not too successful!
Twickenham Advantage;Twickenham, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Twickenham Fine Ales;Seeing as I used to work at the brewery, I don’t think I’m really allowed to give a rating, so I’ve just matched my numbers with Duff’s. This was brewed after I left the brewery, and I think it’s hugely drinkable. Winner of the Gold Medal at the Twickenham Beer Festival (which didn’t just have Twickenham Beers, for all you cynics!). Citrus grapefruitiness, lightly biscuity flavourswith a dry hoppy finish, and bitterness emerging late in the finish. I was really happy for everyone at the brewery that this beer has been so successful. Very good. Not too sure which pubs sell Advantage locally, but the Clubhouse on Richmond Road does (just a little down from the excellent Real Ale shop at 371 Richmond Road).
Twickenham Advantage;Twickenham, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Twickenham Fine Ales;Cask@Twickenham beer festival. A nice addition to the Twickenham Fine Ales stables and comes just behind the IPA in my ratings. I found this too be quite citric, with some grapefruit notes. Slightly grainy malt mouthfeel. But nicely citric with some floral hops, i could definitely down a few of these.
Sudd Cwmpo Drosto Dry Cider;Haverfordwest, Dyfed, Wales;Apple Cider;Sudd Cwmpo Drosto Cider;Barrel@Twickenham beer festival. Quite cheesy, dry and sour, appleskin acidity. The finish is slightly empty, but its not a bad cider by any stretch.

Durham County;Bowburn, Durham, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Durham Brewery;Poured a slightly hazed golden color with a small off-white head. The aroma was sweet, malty and grainy with some caramel notes and a hint of citrus. Malty flavor that has a light citrus (fruit not hop) and then some caramel. Mild bitterness on the finish. Light to medium bodied.

Durham County;Bowburn, Durham, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Durham Brewery;Cask@Twickenham beer Festival. Some old man aromas (shaving foam, hair cuttings).

Portsmouth Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth Brewery;Dark black body with no head. Smells of wheat and a little lager? Tastes like a great mix of the two and it is a beautiful balance
Portsmouth Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth Brewery;Dark brown with a modest white head. Lots of yummy nectar fruits, a killer yeast character, and a slight hint of roasty malts make for a delectable quaff.
Portsmouth Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth Brewery;Pours deep mahogany into a Sam glass. Mocha conglomerate head with good retention recedes leaving sheet lacing. Dark caramel aromas. Slightly thin with sweet bubblegum upfront turning to roasted caramel and sweet cloves before a lasting slightly sour smoke finish.
Portsmouth Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth Brewery;"Got two 22oz bottles from the gift shop next to the brewpub. Came out of the bottle with a wonderful frothy head, almost like a nitro brew. Wonderful banana aromas. The flavor is well of banana and malts, with a little spice on the back side. This is a perfectly balanced, delicious and refreshing dunkelweizen. My idea of a ""perfect"" beer! (I also had it ontap at the brewpub, and it was equally great)."
Portsmouth Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth Brewery;had a pint on Tap with liveFREEorRYE. Head was nearly gone by the time it got to the table. Deep dark amber color. Aroma very nice malt. Lingers slightly on the finish. One of the better brews this place has to offer. A+
Portsmouth Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth Brewery;Really excellent. Aromas of clove, banana and milk chocolate - classic. The flavor is lightly chocolaty, with notes of plantain and just enough spices to make it delicious and interesting with a full, rich mouth-feel.
Portsmouth Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth Brewery;A darned fine example of the style. Pour was chestnut brown, no head or lacing. A nice rich dlavor of banana, roast and clove. A typical description, but rich and a nice balance of all the classic flavors. Well done.
Portsmouth Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth Brewery;Cloudy brown pour with a slight off-white head.. Aroma was sweet caramel malt with some sweet banana and clove up front. Flavor was a little harsh, banana and clove spice that really was too phenolic at points. Some definite peatiness, as identified by FlacoAlto, but really a bit muddled. An ultimately unsuccessful interpretation in my mind.
Portsmouth Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth Brewery;"Extremely aggressively carbonated as a very soft pour nets me seven fingers of foamy, lightly browned head (including one above the rim of my glass) and some foam overflow on my desk. The beer is a dark plum color that shows a hazy, red amber color when held up to the light. The aroma has lots of clove, a touch of up front banana, a toasty malt character and a definite smokiness in the finish. The smokiness has overtones of burning plastic to it, though it never gets really out of hand and really reminds me of Peat smoked malt. Definitely interesting, certainly not bad, but I was not expecting the smoke. The taste has a sweetness to it up front with some light clove notes, the smokiness then kicks in adding smoky flavors as well as phenolic notes that seem to be a little harsh at times. This has a rich maltiness to it up front that is quite nice (unfortunately this is quickly drowned out by the salty peat smoke). The peat smoke really lingers on in the palate too and interferes with subsequent sips; it is really hard to pull out any other flavors because of this. A very interesting interpretation of a Dunkel Weizen. I think that beech-wood smoked malt would have been a better choice here as it would have melded better with the traditional Weizen flavors (indeed I have had good smoked Weizens in Bamberg before). Ultimately the Peat-smoked malt clashes with the rest of the beer, such that this really just doesn’t work for me. I do like the attempt though as it is an interesting try."
Portsmouth Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Portsmouth Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Murky, dirty brown with a small tan head. Wheat, caramel, bubblegum and light banana make for an interesting nose. Complex flavor too, all of the above plus an underlying spiciness and a whiff of smoke. Good stuff!

Drakes Papa Denogginizer;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Drakes Brewing Company;Tasted on tap at the 2005 Pizza Port Strong Ale festival. Orange gold color. Medium sized head. Aroma is floral hops, caramel and sweet. A medium to full bodied Barley Wine. Malts are caramel, and fairly sweet. Hops are grapefruity and piney. Very full mouthfeel, nearly oily. Lots of sweet malts. Lots of orange and caramel malts, with a nice hoppiness underneath. Very smooth Slight touch of alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet with a little alcohol bite.
Drakes Papa Denogginizer;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Drakes Brewing Company;9th PP SA Fest. Hazy amber with a small off-white head. Fruity sweet thick malt with nice hops. Alcohol is present in the aroma. Flavor continues with sweet malt of caramel and fruit. Moderate hops. Long malty finish and nice warming sensation. I like this a lot but I think my score reflects it getting lost in all the other beers at the fest.
Drakes Papa Denogginizer;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Drakes Brewing Company;Tasted at the pizza port strong ale fest. Given its hoppyness I originally thought it was a double IPA, these days you can’t always tell! Quite nice with an intense hoppy character and enough malt that it’s somewhat balanced. This hophead enjoyed it.
Drakes Papa Denogginizer;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Drakes Brewing Company;On draft at Hollingshead Deli, Orange, CA This copper colored gem is a an excellent balance between hops and malt. And, as others have noted, far too drinkable. Great malty, stick flavors balanced by hoppiness.
Drakes Papa Denogginizer;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Drakes Brewing Company;Draft. Rich copper-amber beer with a nice off-white head. Huge peach/hop aroma - very fruity. Peach and caramel flavor - appricot, mango, cherry, tobacco. Very drinkable - way too drinkable. Hides alcohol very well. Was told is was a triple IPA. This is better than the standard Denogginizer (which is saying a lot). Just amazing. Please brew this again.
Drakes Papa Denogginizer;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Drakes Brewing Company;"Whether or not this is considered a ""mistake"" is open to interpretation, I would consider it a happy mistake. A wonderful bready, oloroso and Brandy nose gives way to a huge warming malt complexity that is massive beyond words. Earthy and toasty notes of bread, cake, raisins, plums, cherries, tobacco, mint, and HOPS. very nice clean and semi sweet finish make this a mistake worth repeating."
Drakes Papa Denogginizer;San Leandro, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Drakes Brewing Company;Draft. Billed as a Triple IPA I believe. Pours a dark copper color with very little head. Malty aroma with some citrus hoppiness. Big hop presence in the flavor however it’s the malt aspects that jump out at you. Finishes with a bit of a bourbon and tobacco note going into a big alcohol warmth. This is a fantastic beer that drinks like a fine Barley Wine. Drakes knocks another one out of the park!

Aroma is of tinned fruit in syrup, some light citric hop character. medium body, sweet finish. standard golden ale, not really to my tastes.
Houston Ashton Lane Ale;Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Houston;Was nice, it was brewed for a festival here, in Glasgow, but it was a little annoying after almost all the bottle, is to heavy if you are drinking a lot of beers. PAle yellow, and heavy foam when pooring, nice.

Aass Very Christmas;Drammen, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Aass Bryggeri;Bottled. Pale brown colour. Light grainy nose, feels thin. Light malty flavour but too thin to get excited. Still clean without flaws.
Aass Very Christmas;Drammen, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Aass Bryggeri;Tan, smallish head, creamy head with large bubbles, subsides quickly. Clear, dark winy red body. Aroma is entirely cinnamon and cloves, and some water. Not really that pleasant. Taste is like the aroma, but with rather more roastiness. No real aftertaste, unfortunately. Well. The idea of a spiced beer is good, but the beer itself is only OK.
Aass Very Christmas;Drammen, Norway;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Aass Bryggeri;A sweet beer without enough hops to balance it. Spices are added to the beer, but that does not help it much. A novelty beer.
Grand Rapids Belgian Dubble;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;odd for a belgian double...dark brown appearance with minimal head...aroma is of roasted notes, caramels, and alcohol....same with the flavor...very odd beer, but not bad
Ringnes Bryggerimester Spesial Julen 2005;Oslo, Norway;Flavored - Other;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Bottled. colour pale almost red. Aroma very licorice. reddish head.flavour water and anis. long unpleasent finish
Ringnes Bryggerimester Spesial Julen 2005;Oslo, Norway;Flavored - Other;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);330 ml bottle. Bright, clear light-brown colour. Almost red head. Aroma is heavily dominated by licorice and anis. The body is quite sweet and over dominated by the same ingredients as the aroma. This is a very different beer to the normally conservative Norwegian Christmas beer scene, but the result is an unbalanced watery beer with to much “non-beer” flavours. Less spices, more malt and some hops and maybe more alcohol could do the trick. The idea is good but the results missed totally this time. The colour is nice itself, but when they call it a Christmas beer in Norway I expect more colour. This is the reason for the low appearance point of my rating.
Ringnes Bryggerimester Spesial Julen 2005;Oslo, Norway;Flavored - Other;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);(Bottle 33 cl) Clear, dark cognac colour with a small, beige head. Lightly spicy aroma with traces of licorice. Presumably this has added bourbon vanilla and star aniseed - especially the latter shines through. Has some strange notes of rum and marzipan and some more common of caramel. I don’t really know what to mean about this. Definitely unusual and unlike anything else I’ve tried. Points for trying something different - very different. 090106
Ringnes Bryggerimester Spesial Julen 2005;Oslo, Norway;Flavored - Other;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Spicy nose with cinnamon and ginger. Reddish brown in color with a medium head. Spicy in the mouth with cherry notes and a light spicey bitterness. Nice.
Ringnes Bryggerimester Spesial Julen 2005;Oslo, Norway;Flavored - Other;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Bottled. Copper-colored with off-white head. Malty, grainy aroma. Some licorice or anise notes too. Thin and watery. Malt in flavor, and some anise, but quite one-dimensional. Some bitterness at the end. This beer is said to be developed by an expert team of brewmasters. Guess they had a bad day at work. (051215)
Ringnes Bryggerimester Spesial Julen 2005;Oslo, Norway;Flavored - Other;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);"Offwhite head; red-brown body. Deep licorice aroma with notes of malts, corn and overwhelming anise. Aroma certainly is interesting, if not that good. Taste is initially only bitter, but quickly followed by a deep chocolate and anise flavour. Aftertaste is dry, followed by nothing. Well. A different beer, that’s for sure, but not that good, or even interesting. I see that this is Ringnes’s attempt to do something different, but they could have tried a lot of things more interesting (or better!) than this."
Ringnes Bryggerimester Spesial Julen 2005;Oslo, Norway;Flavored - Other;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);330 ml clear bottle. Ringnes intend to present a new recipe for their Bryggerimester Spesial each year, and the 2005 edition is definitely VERY different from the 2004 edition (each vintage is listed separately at RateBeer). Beautiful deep amber colour, decent head. Aroma is dominated by strong anise / cough medicine notes, not a perfect marriage with the weaker notes of caramel malts. Hints of thyme. Flavour is also dominated by anise, vanilla notes are much weaker. Fairly light bodied, malts do not come up front. Some faint hops and anise again in the aftertaste. The 2004 edition was quite good for its strength, the 2005 is not. Definitely not my cup of tea, sorry: beer. Experiments are okay in the world of beer, but there’s no guarantee that they will be successful. This one isn’t. To be avoided. Better luck next year.
