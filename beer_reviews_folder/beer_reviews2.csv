Pony Express Honey Blonde Ale;Olathe         ,Kansas,United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flying Monkey Brewing;Nice head.

Slightly hazy deep golden color. Average carbonation and head. Soft maltiness carries most of the flavor here                                                                                                                                        ,with some spicy hops in the middle and the honey and spices adding some sweetness to the finish (just a tad much,in fact). Pretty refreshing. Light-bodied. Just found out a few days ago that this brewery is no more. Sad.
Pony Express Honey Blonde Ale;Olathe         ,Kansas,United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flying Monkey Brewing;I guess the description explains it. I couldn't figure out what that flavor was. It was a much better coriander flavor than a funky hop flavor. Reasonably crisp.
Pony Express Tornado Red Ale;Olathe          ,Kansas,United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Flying Monkey Brewing;In the bottle from Dirty John�s. Orange red in color with a thin white head. Very mild toasted caramel aroma                                                                              ,but not much else that I can pick out. This is watery and fizzy.

Just adds graininess like any other adjunct                           ,it seems to me.

Pony Express Thunderbolt Nut Brown Ale;Olathe, Kansas, United States;Brown Ale;Flying Monkey Brewing;The pony express has galloped outta town and left some very satisfied customers behind. This brown has far more nuttiness and drinkability than most! It's almost mild, but that would seem like a backhanded compliment. Absolutely fantastic! God help 'ya if you're looking to get you're hands on this. It's sort of a Kansas thing. Ask Indra (a great trader) to get some for you.
Black Star Amber Export;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Northern Brewing Company;Pours a little darker than the Golden lager. Aromas of roast malts, a touch of hops. Flavor is mellow roast malt with a hint of hops.
Black Star Amber Export;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Northern Brewing Company;Bottle (many, 2001-2). As regular Black Star (Golden Lager) faded into the skunky sunset, this became a more viable choice in cheap ($3/6-pack), easily quaffed local beer. A surprising cascade punch in this amber lager, amber malts smooth out the falvor for a touch of balance. Has a paper pulp aftertaste that is unsettling. Not an attractive amber darkness, sort of green at the edges, slight head. A bit sweet, cloying when warm. I think I wrote these comments in reverse order.
Black Star Amber Export;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Northern Brewing Company;Fairly decent I enjoy it more than the golden lager, more flavor, a slight bit of hops, which gives it a nice touch. Not too bad.
Black Star Amber Export;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Northern Brewing Company;This is a good beer for the money (less than Bud in Gardiner, MT), and a decent beer at any price. I've certainly had more expensive beers that weren't as good.
Black Star Black Lager;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Northern Brewing Company;Bottle pours almost black in color with a 2 finger off-white head that leaves some decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is roasted grains with some chocolate and coffee. Taste is roasted malt and hop bitterness with some chocolate malty sweetness and hints of coffee. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. A really pleasant black lager that I am sad to see has been retired.
Black Star Black Lager;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Northern Brewing Company;Hmmmm, I�m surprised this is retired as I just had it on tap at the Red Caboose diner in Whitefish. Maybe it was the Fred�s but with an old tap handle? Anyway, I�m going to rate it as is-- very dark stouty brown, bitter roast aroma, some chocolate. Generously malty palate, flavourful roastiness, slightly sweet. IHaving recently tried the Fred�s, I can honestly say this was more flavourful, but perhaps it has more to do with this being on tap (I tried Fred�s from the bottle).
Black Star Black Lager;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Northern Brewing Company;Pours a deep brown color. Aromas of light chocolate, a hint of coffee, and a touch of hops. Flavor is bold on this one, coffee bitterness with a mellow chocolate, smoooth finish.
Black Star Black Lager;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Northern Brewing Company;"Another quality, quaffable, Cheap beer from Black Star (Bottles 2001-3). Dark brown/black, schwarzy looking stuff. Huge head that fades. Like other ""black"" beers, this falls short of matching its appearance to its body as it is thin, a bit watery, and not at all sweet (except for a lagerish sweetness. As I've said before, this is not my favorite style. Nice roasted malt front and certainly dry on the finish, as advertised."
Black Star Black Lager;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Northern Brewing Company;"Bottle. Funny, the brewery is near Kallispell, Montana, not San Francisco--that's why many of you haven't seen it. Dark braown beer, almost completely opaque. The head is aggressive, but subsides quickly with no lace to speak of. Chocolate, roast malts, with mild hop character--especially in th oce--they dry hop it, hence the ""double hopped"" on the label. The body is somewhat thin. This is a typical large scale microbrew--or a small macrobrew. I heard the brewery was started by a grandson of Henry Weinhard's, but that may be urban myth."
Black Star Black Lager;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Northern Brewing Company;A macro-style schwarzbier. Sweet at first with a definite watered down taste. But for $3.99 a six paxk you really can't complain.
Black Star Black Lager;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Northern Brewing Company;Very impressed with this one. Aroma is cream, and vanilla with slight scent of fruit. Black beer, creamy head lasts for the entire glass. Palate is full bodied, creamy, malty. Reminds me a lot of a brown ale, or stout without the strong roasted quality. The roasted flavors are subtle, and rich. very satisfying.

It tastes light to medium citric sour, light sweet and light bitter with a wheaty finish. Light body, slick texture, fizzy carbonation. I find it strange that this is labeled a Fruit Beer; the wheat is so much more prominent. Then again, it could also have been a �complex Pale Lager�. I enjoyed it."
Great Northern Bear Naked Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Great Northern Brewing Company;On draught at the brewpub in Whitefish, Montana. Pours a clear reddish amber brew with a decent off-white head that slowly dissolves to a fine film and moderate lacing.

Great Northern Bear Naked Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Great Northern Brewing Company;Draft 6 oz�er at the taproom. True amber in color with moderate lacing from the head. Not much of an aroma, maybe a light caramel. The flavor almost seems berry-like, which is interesting but good. Wish I�d gotten their description of this. Quite smooth with a bit of bitter way on the back of the tongue. This was my favorite here. (#2863, 5/12/2007)

Great Northern Bear Naked Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Great Northern Brewing Company;Very cloudy amber/brown color. smallish cream colored head. Somewhat typical amber nose. Aromas of mild caramel with a PNW hops profile. Light sweet start with a heavy flavor and bitterness acidity in the middle and coasting through to the end. Quite sharp and unbalanced in the finish with the alcohol coming out a touch to really twist things around. Thanks slikwily for this one. Some of the fault in this one may go back to the yeast as well. This one seems to have a few funky yeast characteristics that become more interesting as it warms.
Great Northern Bear Naked Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Great Northern Brewing Company;Nice copper red color,small off white head that had a short hangtime then faded to nothingness.Light malt and grapefruit aroma with a decent hop showing,a little spicy but nothing overpowering.I have to side with willblake on this brew,it is bad the flavors are out of balance with the grapefruit being nasty and bitter.The hops are there but just seem poorly done.i�m just not sure but there is something bad wrong with this beer and i think they would be better off scrapping the recipe and starting over.It�s worth trying atleast once but no more then that.
Great Northern Bear Naked Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Great Northern Brewing Company;Poured copper-ish, but fizzy with little head. Flavors of malted bile and spiced beef stew with tumeric. This might be the worst beer I've ever had. Seriously, like rotten grapefruit. Awful beer. So bad that I don't want to try another to see if the bottle was just fouled somehow. Avoid at all costs.
Great Northern Bear Naked Amber;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Great Northern Brewing Company;This is probably one of the best beers I have ever had.

Barley Boys Jacks Black Porter;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Porter;Barley Boys Brewing;(Bottle 35,5 cl) Pours a clear, reddish mahogany with a nice, light brown head. Vinous aroma of dried fruit and roasted malt. Some vanilla and chocolate in a body of medium size. Limited bitterness. 290806
Barley Boys Jacks Black Porter;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Porter;Barley Boys Brewing;A pitch black beer with a brown head. The aroma is sweet yet with strong dusty and well stored fruity notes. The flavor has a somewhat boring sweetness combined with well stored fruits, leading to a boring dry end. I wonder if it is over its prime or it has just been brewed like this - I think more freshness in the fruit notes.
Barley Boys Jacks Black Porter;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Porter;Barley Boys Brewing;Bottled. Very dark brown coloured. Brown dense head. Sweet and roasted arome with some fuity notes.

Barley Boys Jacks Black Porter;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Porter;Barley Boys Brewing;Bottled. Dark brown coloured. Oxidized aroma. Old fruits flavour. Light bodied. Seems too old.
Barley Boys Jacks Black Porter;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Porter;Barley Boys Brewing;(12 oz bottle: Obtained 11-Nov-05 in trade with Sully, thanks Mike!) It�s difficult to know where this beer was a few years ago because this sample is pretty significantly oxidized, but there is still quite a bit of chocolate maltiness and moderate roastiness in the flavor for me to enjoy, with the chocolate finishing very strongly. Earth, prunes, and soy sauce attest to this beer�s age. Just a mild bitterness from the roastiness, and the beer is not all that sweet either. Definite soy sauce and deep earthiness in the nose, perhaps some dark, shriveled fruits too. Body is medium and the moderate carbonation level is solid for a beer this old. Very dark brown in color, about as dark as it can get without being black. Only a hint of ruddiness at the edges. Not a whole lot of head on the pour, not a surprise to me given the age, and retention is only fair, fully dissipating within seven or eight minutes. But significant patchy lacing covers a good portion of the glass. Normally with a beer in this oxidized state, I�d toss the bottle and get a new sample. Obviously that can�t happen in this case, so I�m trying to ignore the affects of the oxidation, in effect judging where I think this beer probably was two years ago. In that respect, there are a number of elements that I like, namely the chocolate, the earthiness and the dark fruits.
Barley Boys Jacks Black Porter;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Porter;Barley Boys Brewing;Bottle courtesy of SuIIy: Pours a nearly opaque very dark brown with a thin, lightly-lacing light tan head. Sweet dark toasty caramel aroma has lots of raisins and a touch of soy sauce. Body starts with a nice sweet dark malty and chocolate chip cookie dough flavor with good dark fruit complexity. Finishes sticky with some lightly roasted malt. A very nice porter, shame it isn�t brewed any more.

Aroma is fantastic.. Milk Chocolate, coffee, roasted malts. Flavor is also very robust. Nice coffee, chocolate blend, quite decadent. Finishes nicely with the brief hops.. Palate is remarkably smooth and creamy. Quite thick for a porter and really hangs around in the mouth.. A nice lingering chocolate flavor stays with you for a bit after each sip.. This is a fantastic porter... I�m glad I got to try it.. It is a shame it is not still being made!!! Another state to cross off as well.

Brooklyn Pilsner;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);A more flavourful pilsner than I'm used to. It's kinda like drinking a light Gose - hints of citrus and coriander. Will definitely be looking for this in the beer store.
Brooklyn Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);They are calling this an English Pale Ale, though I had a tough time distinguishing between English and American Pale Ale. Maybe somewhere in between? Some of the other English Pale Ales seemed a little more yeasty, or different kind of hops. This was leaning more towards the sweet side, some citrus to it...why I was thinking APA when I sampled. Only grabbed a single to try. Not sure was good enough to buy a 6-pack, but will probably sample again somewhere down the road.
Brooklyn Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Tap als Brooklyn ale amber. Prettig van smaak en goed kroegbier. Aangename smaakvariaties, maar niet verbluffend.
Brooklyn Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);From Mar 2008 I got this in a trade with yobdoog. Thanks Trevor! This pours a clear amber with a 2 finger head of foam. I have to say, Brooklyn beers all seem to not be lacking in the foam department and most have great retention...as does this one. The smell is nice and sweet from caramel malt and I'm guessing, some fruitiness. The taste is a little lighter than what I expected but there's good notes of caramel malt, bread, a little roastiness, and some bitterish hop flavour that does some balancing. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation is medium, and it finishes slightly bready, slightly bitter, and at the end, a bit watery. Pretty good stuff and would be better if it hadn't lost all its flavour at the end. Still, I'd drink it again, no problem.
Brooklyn Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);BB backlog. Draft in NYC before my sisters wedding. Gotta take what you can get sometimes.

Blanche de Brooklyn;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);This was a tough one for me. The aroma was very poeppery and spicy, even for this style. Maybe a lemon/citrus thing in the far background. The appearance was very pale yeallow, white head, typical for the style. The flavor is again very peppery, spicy, coriander, wheat, and a slight lemon flavor. The finish is again dominated by the pepper and accompanying spices, making for an uncomfortable feeling, especially on a hot day like yesterday. The mouthfeel is between thin and medium. Decently crafted, except the pepper dominated the beverage and made it less than enjoyable for me.

Brooklyn Monster Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);10.3% ABV- Not one of the better barleywines out there. Still a good beer, just thought it would be a little better since it's in the Brooklyn family. This is a 2011 bottle and seemed pretty fresh, so thinking and hoping this will get better with age. Saving one to open a few years from now with some other barleywines like Old Stock, Barleycorn, etc. Alcohol seemed a little too overpowering, which I've had plenty of 10-12% beers that had better drinkability. Appearance has more red tint and clearer than the average in this style. Not something I will get again, but curious to see how the single I'm saving will do with age.

Saranac Golden Pilsener;Utica, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;F.X.

Saranac Golden Pilsener;Utica, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;I�ve never been a fan of light beers, except maybe at a bar during Monday Night Football while eating hot wings. I prefer taste over a light body, so it�s rare that a light beer can be truly tasty and weighty. Saranac Golden Pilsener comes pretty close, but I think half the appeal is in the name. From what I understand from the other beer snobs on epinions, this beer is not truly a pilsner, rather, just a unique lager. If you were to do a blind taste test and ask drinkers to distinguish this beer from Miller Lite I�ll bet many wouldn�t be able to do it. POUR, COLOR AND AROMA As soon as I poured Saranac Golden Pilsener into an actual pilsner glass I was a bit surprised it immediately took on the qualities of a Bud or Coors Light. It�s extremely thin in appearance and pours to a very light golden color, almost bright yellow, in fact. There�s a lot of carbonation immediately after the pour, but it calms down surprisingly quickly. What�s also interesting is despite the fact I poured it to form a minimal amount of head, its head started off small but then quickly blossomed. Then after only a few minutes the head dissipated rather quickly � can�t this beer make up its mind? There isn�t much to comment on as far as aroma since this beer has a fairly generic scent, although it definitely leans a bit towards the malts and has a bit sweeter smell. It�s somewhere between that annoying big-name brew smell and the aroma of a true craft beer. TASTE Some beers are absolutely delicious and some are completely awful. Then there are beers like Saranac Golden Pilsener which are pretty neutral in taste. This beer tastes a lot like the generic light beers it seems to be imitating. It�s extremely smooth, which is good, but there just isn�t much to be said as far as taste. The palate is weak and watery with the bare minimum of sweetened malts. It certainly tastes better than any beer with the word �lite� in its name, but doesn�t match up to good beers. BODY Despite the bland taste, I have to give Saranac Golden Pilsener a pat on the back for its extremely smooth and light body. It�s one of the easiest beers to drink I�ve had in a long time. Since it tastes so much like water, it drinks a lot like water too. It would make a great party beer since it�s so light and smooth. But on its own it�s pretty unsatisfying. FINAL THOUGHTS It seems like I�ve tasted a lot of beers lately that are neutral in taste but light in body. I�m torn whether to recommend Saranac Golden Pilsener or not because it�s nothing special, but it is easy to drink and does taste better than your average light beer. As a craft brew it leaves a lot to be desired, but I think the average drinker wouldn�t be too disappointed by this beer.
Saranac Golden Pilsener;Utica, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Decent pilsner showing. Not a whole lot of complex flavors, slightly dry and bready.

Saranac Black and Tan;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Pours black with a thin tan head. Aroma of roasted malt. Taste is light and malty, nutty aftertaste. Palate has earthy nut notes on the back of the tongue. Interesting.
Saranac Black and Tan;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Found out of bottle from a variety pack. Pours a dark brown, with an off white foam. Medium roasted flavor with a slight hint of coffee.
Saranac Black and Tan;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;(from 2011 notes) A - quite dark for a black and tan: although a bit of light comes thru creating mahogany highlights at the edges, the beer is close to opaque. The modest tan head has a nice mixed density appearance, very good retention, and leaves plenty of lacing. The nose is quite fine if a bit subdued, and featured hop tinged medium and dark malts. Very slightly floral. Of course, I knew what I was drinking but still the fact that this is a mix of a lager and a stout actually seemed apparent in the taste. This failure to blend seamlessly is to be expected and actually added to the complexity and enjoyment of the beer. This even held for mouthfeel which did seamlessly combine the two into something like an average body (i.e., heavy for a lager/ light for a stout), again in a very enjoyable mix where the combination as considerably more effervescent and a bit drier than a typical stout. The finish is stronger (mainly dark malt) and longer lasting than one might predict based on the strength of the preceding flavors. O - If memory serves me well, this is about as enjoyable as a black and tan in a bottle gets, although one can do better with various combinations of beers found on draft at a good pub. Over-priced in Prague but a bargain in Eastern U.S.A.
Saranac Black and Tan;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Translucent brown color. Rocky tan head. Fragrant roasted malt nose. Tangy toasted malt flavor with lactic undertones. Assertive hop finish. Burnt malt aftertaste.

Saranac Black and Tan;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;The head is tan, thick, and it makes good lacing on my pint glass. Roasted malts, hops, caramel and toffee notes, fill your nose. On the tongue there are flavor notes of roasted malts, toast, espresso, and wild tart blackberries. The bitterness of the hops surrounds and balances everything nicely and leads to a slow bitter finish. It has a nice medium body and a creamy smooth mouth feel that makes it very enjoyable.
Saranac Black and Tan;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X.

Mouthfeel � The body is slightly above average and has a good creaminess. The carbonation is on the lighter side and is quite nice for the brew. Overall it is a very nice mouthfeel. Overall � This was a rather tasty and affordable brew. It had a nice smooth flavor and mouthfeel profile and made for a good session beer.
Saranac Black and Tan;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. Consumed March 28, 2012. She pours a jet black color and leaves the same colored body with a slight brown around the edges. The head dissipates within seconds. The smell has a slightly creamy sweet blend of coffee and has some toasted bread character to it. The taste is nutty and chocolate sweetness with a tinge of bitter coffee at the end. On the palate, she sits about a light to medium, slightly sessionable with a tangy aftertaste and finish. Overall, it is a decent brew that I might have again.
Saranac Black and Tan;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Black and Tan�s in a bottle never really taste like black and tan�s but there�s something to be said for beer mixes. This one is decent. Has some roasted quality, some chocolate, and the mildness and mouthfeel of an amber. Off flavors abound unfortunately.
Saranac Black Forest;Utica, New York, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"12 oz bottle served in pint glass (from 2010 notes). A - pours clear dark brown with nearly black color in glass. Ample and thick light brown head. aroma - sweet malt; more similar to a Belgian dubbel than expected. T - nice sequence of mellow flavors, with detectable hops in finish. Feel. nice smooth and full feel; good carbonation level Overall: goes down easy, but hindered by an aroma that is only modestly attractive."

Saranac Black Forest;Utica, New York, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a ruby brown with a massive off-white head that dissipates to a clumpy film. Some lacing on the glass. Muted aromas of gingerbread, dark fruit and a bit of toffee. Upfront flavors of German yeast, plum, cocoa, citrus, cola and bready tones. Mildly hoppy with a long, malty finish. Medium carbonation. Lively mouthfeel with a slight oiliness that coats the tongue. As a craft beer, this isn�t much of a standout, but as a traditional German schwarzbier, this is pretty good.
Saranac Black Forest;Utica, New York, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Beer of the month club. Deep dark brown with mahogany highlights, two-finger tan head and nice lace. Aromas of toast, caramel, ash and faint citrus.

Saranac Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Translucent brown, black color topped by a huge creamy tan head. Rich chocolatey roasted malt aroma. Bitter roasted malt flavor is creamy and finishes dry.
Saranac Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Transfer from BA reviewed 1-23-12 - Poured from bottle into pint glass Appearance -A Nice deep brown color - nearly black. It formed a small light tan head upon pouring which faded to leave good lacing. Smell - Roasted malt with a slight coffee aroma first meet the nose. These are then lost in lieu of a milk chocolate aroma mixed with an ever so light vanilla and herbal hop aroma. Taste - The flavor well matched the aroma. A sweet maltiness first meets the tongue which gives way quickly to a more roasty malt flavor. This persists for much of the taste profile, but then at the end gives way to a bit of hop, but quite a bit of cocoa and a small amount vanilla flavor mixed with a little bit of alcohol flavor at the very end. Mouthfeel - The carbonation is at a very nice level, but the body/viscosity of the beer is a little too thin for the style. Overall - An average beer. The body or lack there of, take away while. I should note though that it has some other nice qualities, such as smell. If you are looking for a stout with a bit lighter bodyfeel this stout is for you.
Saranac Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Light and refreshing. Nice light hops. Very light brown appearance. Found this in the back on the fridge and enjoyed it!
Saranac Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Pours a light gold with a thin head. Wild pils flavor is a little less hoppy than mosr making it very smooth and easy to drink could be an easy session beer with a medium ABV.
Saranac Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into snifter. Pours a dark but clear mahogany with a smallish tan head. The head has some staying power, and nicely coats the glass upon tipping. It has an appealing aroma of caramel and dark roasted malts with a touch of spicy hops and a hint of chocolate. The taste follows, but with a touch of coffee in the finish. M: medium carbonation and near medium body; semi-dry finish. Overall: very good for the price point."
Saranac Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Unique combination of tastes. Definitely cool and refreshing as claimed by the product although does taste like a lager.

Saranac Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Had it out of the bottle. Pretty solid, if unspectacular, stout. Good roasted malts give it a nice sweetness. Medium bodied. Not too bad.
Saranac Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;I honestly didn�t have high hopes for Saranac Stout, since it�s a very generic style from a brewery not known for making mind-blowing or experimental beers. In fact, this bottle came in a discounted mix pack and the bottle was only a few weeks away from the expiration. But with all those caveats, I was very surprised to get a tasty, delectable, and highly drinkable beer. Hell yeah! I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Appearance: Opaque black body with a light white, frothy head. Excellent retention and lacing. Smell: Noticeable vinous aroma plus typical stout smell underneath. Taste: Stouts are known for being roasty and usually sweet, but Saranac Stout is surprisingly fruity with a touch of tartness and sourness. Red grape is usually a flavor found in stronger Russian Imperial Stouts, but there�s an obvious grape juice-like taste right from the get-go. It�s lightly sweet, but quickly followed by a more traditional stout flavor of roasty malt bitterness through the middle. Chocolate candy shows up briefly on the finish, as does a hint of iced coffee. But the palate comes full circle back to the original grape or cider-like taste with a tartness right before it finishes clean. I�m not sure if this is how this beer is meant to taste, but in this case it�s actually quite beneficial and certainly threw me off guard since I don�t normally get these flavors in a beer of the style. Drinkability: I was quite surprised to find out after the fact that Saranac Stout is only 4.8% ABV. Not because it felt like a brick on my system, but because it had so much flavor for something in the more sessionable category. The thin, tepid mouthfeel enables it to go down almost as smoothly as a Guinness. The clean aftertaste combined with the light, tart palate makes it almost refreshing. Impressive!
Saranac Stout;Utica, New York, United States;Stout;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Roasted malt, cardboard, charred wood, vanilla, and sawdust with walnut accents, quite woody. Clear mahogany, thin tan head. Tart heavily roasted malt, ash, and vanilla. Bitingly bitter char and grapenut finish. Vanilla is pleasantly ever-present. On the other hand, there is too much char and it�s too tart. Odd, but ok.

Good flavors, surprisingly deep. Not overly sweet, and way better than your basic lager.
Saranac Seasons Best Nut Brown Lager;Utica, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;The body had a nice deep brownish amber color with good clarity. Its head was light tan in color, big and think with very good retention. It also made lots of lacing on the glass. Its aroma has big, sweet and malty body with some light nutty and fruity notes. The flavor has a solid toasted malty character with a mellow buttery/nutty presence. Hop flavor is modest, slightly floral, and adds just enough bitterness for some balance. The hops comes out more towards the finish which is fairly clean and somewhat dryer. The texture is wet and easy drinking with average carbonation and a medium body. Overall this is a solid ale and works well as one of Saranac�s Winter Seasonal beers
Saranac Seasons Best Nut Brown Lager;Utica, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Pours deep coper, slight thin head, this lacing that dissipates quickly. Bready, toffee caramel aroma. Sweet bready malt, toffee, caramel taste up front, bit of noble hop bitterness mid mouth and on the finish with more toffee and caramel. Mouth feel is thin, slightly more than medium carbonation, pleasent. Overal tasty, well made beer, not great, but good for a vienna type lager, almost a marzen flavor, but less robust and refined.

Saranac Chocolate Amber;Utica, New York, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;16th September 2008. Very dark beer that shows a red tint in front of a light. Some mild toasted malt and a little chocolate in a soft beer that has no bitterness or dryness. Seems like a modest porter but no worse for being so.

Rich. Some nice top lace. Rich dark amber smell. Notes of light caramel. Sweet chocolate aroma. Mix between a sweet, rich amber and a dry, bitter porter/stout. Interesting. The taste is like a black & tan: initial heavy stout flavor with a sweeter secondary flavor. A little smoky in the ambery second wave. Bitter malty afterbite. A little dry in the feel, chalky. Smoother at the end. Medium bodied. Feels like a stout first, then an amber. Not bad but not amazing. Feel like a mixed bag.

Saranac Nut Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a tannish head. Head was frothy. Smelled heavily of hazelnut, some sweet coffee. Flavor was similar, mouthfeel was very thin/watery. Really not all that impressive.
Saranac Nut Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle: Poured a dark amber brown color with a thick head. The aroma was sweet malts. The flavor was slight chocolate and sweet malts. Overall, in typical Saranac fashion, an easy drinker.
Saranac Nut Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a brune amber body with a tan head. Malty sweetness some light earth y bitterness with a touch of some dried fruit. Toasted malt a bit sweet and bitter with a medium body and light carbonation. An average brown.
Saranac Nut Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Nice dark color with a decent fluffy head. Very little aroma. Decent blend of malt/bitter hops taste, but not a very big flavor. Not a bad taste, just not a lot of taste
Saranac Nut Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Rating entered here in error on November 22, 2009 (see Saranac ""Brown Ale"" for actual beer rated)."
Saranac Nut Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Rich, chocolate malty aroma with a subtle but noteable flowery hop balance. Very inviting. Dark amber in color (but still very clear) with an egg shell white head that poured two fingers thick. Pretty lasting lace. Rich, thick body with dark malt flavor (crystal and chocolate?). The bittering hops show up immediately and powerfully during the tasting. The hops used are obviously meant for bittering and flavor rather than aroma. The aftertaste starts with a caramel/buttery feel that quickly moves toward the bitter. The mouthfeel is almost a hybrid. It has the fullness and ""roundness"" of an ale, yet it is crisp like a lager. Carbonation is as expected. A very good beer that is much more hoppy than most dunkels. I lean toward hops. If I was grading against style, I�d probably dock this one. But with my preferences, I like this more than the usually dark lagers because it is so much more flavorful (to me)."
Saranac Nut Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Pours meduim brown Thin off white head. Tases hoppy slighly acidic all and all I have had better nut brown ale
Saranac Nut Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;12oz bottle. light cola colored, small fluffy head. nice nutty malt aroma light malt taste. nothing outstanding but a decent beer
Saranac Nut Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Another one from the Saranac winter samper pack. Pours an amber brown body with a relatively thick tanish head. Not much to the aroma, slightly malty with a mild hop bite. A little more malt in the flavor as that was the dominating flavor but there was a sour, bitter hop bite in there as well. Slightly bitter aftertaste. A pretty good beer but not great. Again, I�ll say Saranac is a pretty good selection, especially when examining one�s budget
Saranac Nut Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;As with most Saranac beers, there is not much going on with this one. It has a light nutty flavor to it, but nothing really special about it. Pours a nice dark color, but is very thin in the mouth.
Saranac India Pale Ale;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Nice golden color with a lasting head; so aesthetically I like it a lot. Floral/citrus notes but I found the aftertaste a little bitter. Overall, it has a lot of drinkability...can easily drink 3 or 4."

Saranac India Pale Ale;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Poured from bottle, pours a dark gold with a thin head, the aroma is of very light hops, more grass than anything, the flavor is very light as well, not much there but a little bitterness in the finish, super boring.
Saranac India Pale Ale;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle. Clear golden color, medium white head. Grassy aroma with subtle pine. Taste is lightly bitter caramel.
Saranac India Pale Ale;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;IPA americana dal colore dorato con schiuma bianca. Al naso resinosa ed agrumata. In bocca bilanciata verso l�amaro del luppolo. Corpo medio e sapore di resina di pino un po troppo invadente che innalza la sensazione alcolica rendendo questa ale poco beverina. Finale persistente e secco.
Saranac India Pale Ale;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Old rating. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but it was horrible. Flat. Too much caramel and just barely there hops. Somewhat cardboardy.
Saranac India Pale Ale;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;drank straight from the bottle..pine,resin aroma..some citrus taste with hints of caramel,florals..grassy..not much to it.
Saranac India Pale Ale;Utica, New York, United States;IPA;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle from a buddy last night - thanks, Steve! Pours a clear orange with a fairly big white head. Malt-leaning IPA- caramel and sweet and pale malts atop minor citrus and pine Cascade hop bitterness. A little resin, a bit of grass and straw, but mostly malts lead the way here. Light-bodied, with medium-high carbonation and a sweet mouthfeel that finishes dry. Not much to it. So-so.
Saranac Belgian White;Utica, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Forgot to rate a bunch of these wits from a few years ago..drank straight from bottle..not very good.
Saranac Belgian White;Utica, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass and a mug. There wasn�t any difference. The appearance was a nice hazy light yellow to orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds leaving some light lacing sliding into the beer. The smell had some light coriander with a tight batch of citrus trying to make a slight emphasis on the flavoring of the beer. The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and combined them pretty well. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat harsh but not overbearing. Overall, I say this was a pretty good beer worthy of having again and worthy of having with its respected food.
Saranac Belgian White;Utica, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Sweet, spicy and tangy everything I love about Belgian white ales. This is a well done Belgian that has a cloudy light golden color with a thin white head. The aroma is pleasant and fruity. Its flavor is nicely balanced, sweet and a little bit tangy. Wheat malts, smooth coriander, tangy orange peel and yeast flavors all play well together on the tongue. The palate is smooth and creamy with a medium body and a nice average carbonation.
Saranac Belgian White;Utica, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Not a bad Belgian wit. Has some decent citrus and spicyness. A bit too watery for my tastes.
Saranac Belgian White;Utica, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Bottle poured into a cheater pint A: hazy straw yellow, 1/4"" head with good retention S: clean, nothing stands out other than slight sweetness T: slightly sweet, hint of spice. I think the orangepeel stands out the most but it is not very noticable. Very bland beer. M: light mouth, feels watery."

Saranac Belgian White;Utica, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;I like something a bit more spiced when im going for a belgian white but still an ok beer.
Saranac Belgian White;Utica, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Cloudy yellow pour, small head. Aroma has some of the belgian white characteristics with banana and wheat, but not much beyond that. Flavor has more banana, fruity esters, and a touch of spice. Missing some elements, but not offensive. Definitely refreshing on a warm evening.
Saranac Belgian White;Utica, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle @ home. Quite cloudy, yellow-orange appearance with a big fluffy, off-white head. Spicy coriander, lemon/orange, citrus fruits, quite spicy, light wheat malty nose. Fairly strong lemon, fairly strong coriander, light wheat flavor. Spicy, citrusy aftertaste. Not a bad witbier.
Saranac Belgian White;Utica, New York, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Poured from bottle. Faint aroma of yeast and fruit cocktail. Cloudy gold, white head. Citrus and fruit juice flavor dominates over yeast and sweet malt. A touch of pepper and spice. A bit watery feel. Somewhat unbalanced, but a decent summer beer.
Saranac K�lsch;Utica, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;It pours golden and clear with a white head. Head retention is moderate. It has a grainy sweet aroma that is also a bit grassy with a slight herbal hop whiff to it. It is grainy sweet with slight honey. It also has a very slight herbal character. It has a light-medium body with a slight dryness in the finish. Overall, mostly grainy sweet for the aroma and flavors.
Saranac K�lsch;Utica, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Aroma is mild grain and fruit. Taste is clean with mild bitterness. Texture is a bit too carbonated for me.
Saranac K�lsch;Utica, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle from Tmoney99 from notes. Pours a slightly clear dark golden color with a medium sized white head. The aroma and flavor have mildly toasted malts, light citrus notes, yeast, pretty standard stuff for a Kolsch. Not as bad as I expected, just nothing to get excited about either.
Saranac K�lsch;Utica, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Aroma is malts/pale malts, mild fruit and a mildly hoppy/somewhat smooth finish.
Saranac K�lsch;Utica, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle from Market Basket Brilliantly clear deep golden color with a small but long lasting bubbly white head. Graham crackery pilsner maltiness with some pomme and pitted fruits. Light floral hops. Crisp light metallic finish. Not horrible but far from a great example of the style. .

Saranac K�lsch;Utica, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Summer mixed 12 pack, 1 of 4 styles in box. Grassy and slightly damp, musky smell. Looks nice. Clear deep golden color, slight white head, lots of visible active carbonation. Flavor is not very pleasing. Some sweet, slight hops, heavy yeast/grain. Just ehhh. Had I known no one was going to drink at my BBQ, I would have just drank from my cellared collection....
Saranac K�lsch;Utica, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Meh. Summer pack. Pretty weak all around. Not offensively bad, but exactly the type of beer that makes me skip this brewer as many times as not. Generic slightly sweet, grainy yellow beer. Like a really well made macro, or a thoroughly boring craft.
Saranac Scotch Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Aroma of smoked peat, chocolate malt. The appearance is a nice clear ruby red, off-white head. The flavor is like the aroma, smoke, chocolate. The mouthfeel is a little thin, and the carbonation is substantial. The finish is a mix of hops, smoke, and lingers. Decent, especially for a Saranac.
Saranac Scotch Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Reddish-brown with a tiny head. Sweet and malty aromas with some faint smoky and woody overtones. Big malty sweetness with some smoked malt comes through as well. Clean and juicy aftertaste with a slight bitterness and some peat. Not bad.
Saranac Scotch Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Glassy dark orange appearance. No head. Quite clear. Looks a bit thin. Smell is strong-ale alcohol. Has an undercurrent of dark caramel. Roasted with high alcohol aroma. Serious smoky flavor, like BBQ. Heavy, loaded with alcohol and a bitterly caramel hint. Very smoky and strong. Malty brown ale flavor. Brown sugar malt aftertaste. Thick and milky. Leaves a light film. Harsh but in a good way. A heavy and thick beer, but balanced and not extreme. A solid beer.
Saranac Scotch Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Crushinator�s bottle from the six pack. Passable beer, but fairly weak for its style. No smell, looks alright its a light brown and lacey, with a lasting off-white head. Above-average carbonation. Only a faint whiff of scotch taste.Not all that drinkable.
Saranac Scotch Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a brown ale with a tan head. Light toasted malt, caramel malt sweetness with a light tawny bitterness. Thin and simple. Not bad.
Saranac Scotch Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Just an average Scotch Ale with the typical smoky and spicy flavors, and a little bit of a weird taste. I think I will pass on this guy, or bear, next time around. LC
Saranac Scotch Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Pours brown with tan head. Smells of sweet malt and caramelly. Tastes sweet and caramelly with a spicy finish.
Saranac Scotch Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;medium brown with a tan head. Not much lacing to speak of. Malty, and a strange after taste. i won�t do this one again.
Saranac Scotch Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;(bottle - 12 oz) Clear copper color with a thin tan head. Aroma has a lot of malts mixed with some dark fruits, blood, yeast, and caramel. Flavor is bitter and malty with a surprising amount of hops at the middle and the finish. Some smokey notes throughout with a bitter, metallic, and cloying finish.
Saranac Scotch Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Clear copper coloured body with an amber tint and a thinnish tan head. Aroma of funky metal, blood, nuts, yeast, mushrooms and roasted malt. Medium-bodied; Strong assertive maltiness and nuttiness following shortly. Metallic finish leads to an over-the-top funkiness. Aftertaste shows metal, malt, yeast and a ton of nuts and perhaps a bit of sugar. Overall, another horribly done beer that results in more off flavours than �on flavours�. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Oliver�s Beverage on 12-July-2008, sampled at home in Washington on 04-September-2008."
Full Sail Amber Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Somewhat sweeter than optimal, I think, with some bread notes. But a spicy finish that more than make up for it. Nice smell. I suspect this is brewed with a blend of malts to increase its complexity. Good with food.
Full Sail Amber Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Pours a bright dark brown with a fast dissipating off-white head. Scents of carmel maltiness. Nice big flavors of malt and an edge of balancing hops. A very nice amber. Low carbonation and a relatively short astringent finish.
Full Sail Amber Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;A ridiculously clear amber brown with a small wispy beige head and a peppery toffee biscuit aroma. Medium bodied with a raspy carbonation. The taste is a bit average with caramel and bread notes some paste and fruits with a dry some spicy herbal honey finish. Quite drinkable but a little too dry for me.
Full Sail Amber Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Pours a dark amber with slightly off white head and minimal lacing. Aroma is some roasted malt with caramel and raisins dominating the nose. Taste follows with some dark fruit and slight baking spice added in. Finished sweet and dry. Nothing spectacular, but a quality beer that I would be happy to return to.
Full Sail Amber Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;16oz on tap at the Holsteins, Las Vegas. Aroma is light malt. Appearance is dark amber with a thin brown-ish foam. Taste is light sweet and slightly bitter. A bit watery. Good.

Full Sail Amber Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Pours clear, dark amber with ruby tine and a two finger, light tan head. Aroma is caramel and hops. Taste is thin caramel, moving to roast, light citrus and a building hop backbone. Finish is hoppy.
Full Sail Amber Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Highly hoppy and at the same time perfectly malted. This balance makes it one of the worlds best beers hands down!!! Bicuity taste and SO smooth. Will always be in my refrigerator. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Full Sail Amber Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle. Copper colour, small head. Aroma is herbal hops, toffee. Medium bitterness, no sweetness. Decent, but not very interesting, very English in character.
Full Sail Amber Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Full Sail Brewing Company;I enjoyed trying this particular beer, unlike some beers in this style I thought it was flavorful and well crafted. Easily drinkable but with just enough bitterness on the back of the tongue.
Full Sail Pale Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Full Sail Brewing Company;From Feb 2008 Another Full Sail beer I got in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! It pours from 12oz bottle a clear gold with a nice 1 finger head of foam. The smell is hoppy but not overly so. Just about right for the style. The taste right off the bat is a nice balance between some good bitter(grassy) hoppiness and malty sweetness. Yum. Very quaffable as well. Go figure. A few more sips in and I notice the hop character does have some citrus and it works really well along side the grass and both work really well with the malt. Dang, this is a tasty brew and very drinkable. It has a medium mouthfeel and carbonation and it finishes both slightly sweet and slightly bitter...again with the balance! I really liked this APA and I think it's one of the better examples of the style that I've tried. I recommend it.
Full Sail Pale Ale;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Full sail poured a nice amber body with plenty of carbonation that left ok lace, thin off white head. Mouthfeel was thin and watery, not much aroma to speak of. Flavor of hops, but it was kind of bland, however the finish was nice. It was o.k. but i probably wont purchase it again. Originally rated on 10/10/2008.
Full Sail Classic IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Clear light copper, off-white lacing foam. Aroma is strong hoppy, taste bitter but not overwhelming. Nice. (Velp 201908)
Full Sail Classic IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;The bottle says no classic. But I assume it is the same. It is easy to drink an enjoy. Not really strong or full bodied.
Full Sail Classic IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;A moderate or 'acceptable' IPA... lighter, less flavor, and not the hoppy adventure that other IPA's offer.
Full Sail Classic IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Pours golden-hazy with a decent head. Aroma is typical of an IPA. Taste isn't bad, I liked how the hops were very crisp and didn't linger too long on the taste buds. Palate leaves something to be desired, I felt as though this was a very one-dimensional beer.

Full Sail Classic IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;This Northwest style IPA is generously hopped to 60 IBU�s with Centennial hops from the Yakima Valley. Brewed in the classic style with two-row Pale and Crystal malt, our IPA is a real thirst quencher. It has a full, malty body and there�s even a hint of fresh citrus to it.

Pours hazy golden orange with a big fluffy white head that retains well and leaves some lacing. The aroma is sweet sugary tropical fruit with some piney hops. The flavor is sweet sugary tropical fruit with some cardboard malts and chemical grassy hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Overall, an OK sweet and fruity IPA with some off notes."
Full Sail Classic IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;"From Jul 2007 This one was acquired in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks, John! It pours from 12oz bottle(best by 070507) a clear medium gold with a small head of foam that shrinks quickly to a fine broken layer with some lacing. The smell is very hoppy with some good notes of grapefruit and grass. The taste is also very hoppy. I'm getting some citrus and grass with even a bigger presence of floral hops. There's *some* malt there in the background but it doesn't have the strength to even come close to balancing out the hop bitterness and now, more noticeable, a pungency that's making my mouth pucker; more malt is something I think this brew needs. I'm finding this IPA just too bitter for my liking. I'll say that the mouthfeel and carbo is up to snuff. I just wish there was more malt influence. Still, I'm glad I got to try this puppy."

Full Sail Oktoberfest;Hood River, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Full Sail Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub - Pours bronze with a beige head. The aroma has rich toasty malt, almonds, hazelnut, butter (in a good way) and is pretty rich. It has a medium / full rich body with soft carbonation. The flavor starts like a rich version of the aroma with fresh dough, lager smoothness and nuttiness. The finish dries things up a bit. Really nice.
Full Sail Oktoberfest;Hood River, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Full Sail Brewing Company;Pours a a clear copper color with a small tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of caramel, toast, biscuit and light floral notes. Taste is caramel, biscuit, light brown sugar and light spices... Overall a light oktoberfest but good melanoidin character.

Arrived a clear amber with a moderate white head that lasted until the last sip and left partial lace. Mild aroma of lightly toasted malt. Thankfully this is much more flavorful than the aroma suggests with ample lightly toasted malt that has a touch of malt sweetness. Very mild bitterness at the finish and fairly smooth on the palate. Medium bodied.
Full Sail Oktoberfest;Hood River, Oregon, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Full Sail Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Pours a nice caramel color, some off-white head, not much lacing.

Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;A little old perhaps, couldn�t tell the date. Aroma is a little dusty, but the flavor was solid. Nutty, earthy with light caramel toast and fruit.
Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Dark bronze, clear with yellow foam. Raisins, toffee in the aroma. Sweet, toffee, fruit with strong metalic bitterness in the aftertaste and a hint of alcohol.
Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Clear bright penny copper with a thin foamy white top. Big lovely toffee pale english malt on the aroma with a slight grassiness. Smooth and slightly bitter flavor, perhaps the most bitter ESB I�ve had in a while (not that bitter overall but probably similar to how true Brits taste ESBs back in the day) with quite a bit of grassy hop flavor, English Marris otter pale malt biscuitiness, and a smoot nutty finish with a quiet grassy bitterness on the aftertaste.
Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Pours a deep dark orange color, some off-white head, not much lacing. Aroma is caramel malt and faint floral hops. Flavor is crisp and bitter, with a malty aftertaste. The palate feels thick and chewy. Look out, this one packs a wallop.
Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Appearance: pours a 1"" off white head that falls quickly with just a hint of lacing. Color is mostly clear copper with mild streaming carbonation. Aroma: malt dominate -- bread dough and a bit of toffee. Hops are floral with a little citrus rind as well. Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied with a fluffy ale mouthfeel. Finish is dry and somewhat boozy. Flavor: toasted bread, toffee, raisin and other ripe fruit. WIth a lingering floral, citrus rind, and even a bit of pine hops. Overall: a very good and enjoyable ESB -- although the 6.5% is a little high as the BJCP guidelines top out at 6.2% -- thus the beer is a little too boozy and would be limited for sessionability."

Full Sail ESB (Extra Special Bitter);Hood River, Oregon, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium to dark amber. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (cookie, caramel, biscuit), lightly to moderately hoppy (apricot, flowers), lightly yeasty (dough), with notes of toffee and black tea. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/velvety/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. My second sampling of this and happily it�s as good as my first impression...it looks like someone actually put some effort into this one, which is becoming rarer and rarer at Full Sail sadly. It�s enticingly cookie-ish and apricotty, and while it starts sweet (in a nice lip-smackin� way), there�s quite a bit of apparent bitterness in the finish (only 35 IBU, really?), so it�s quite delightful to drink.

NorWester Oregon Pale Ale;Portland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);An alright appearance to this one with decent white head. Nose is lightly hoppy and...is there a note of peach or some other sweet fruit? It's a LITTLE too subtle...more aroma strength would be of great benefit. Flavor has that same hint of fruit that I just can't place. Not too hoppy or bitter...in fact, other than the fruit note, there's not much at all. This beer desperately needs some depth to make it better.
